    "text": "I had this bookmarked for awhile! Finally had the chance to try this place. There was no wait at 7:30PM on a Friday night. We were seated right away.   I ordered the one that yelpers raved about, which was Gold Standard and the Cake batter alcoholic shake. Don't judge me, it's Vegas!   My friend got the Rising sun and Maple Bacon shake.   The burgers and fries came out faster than the shake which was kind of strange. Unfortunately, after taking the first bite out of the gold standard, the word \"MEH\" popped in my head immediately. I took a bite out of my friend's Rising sun, and felt EXTREME JEALOUSY. That burger had more flavor and deliciousness.   I loved my cake batter shake though, I love cake batter anything and if you have a sweet tooth, then you're good to go. You can definitely get the shakes without alcohol.   Overpriced for a burger joint, but it's in Cosmo so I didn't expect any less.",

My date for the night had the Gold Standard, which he greatly enjoyed from start to finish. The fries were, ehh...okay. I've had better though, which is probably what prevented me from giving a perfect five star review.   The service was awesome, which I find hard to come by these days. So that is definitely a plus. Not to mention the atmosphere and decor is just as fabulous. Long story short, I will definitely be returning to Holsteins. Probably for a liquid meal, as everyone appears to be fans of the shakes. ;)",

Lots of cute and bright cow-themed decor - fun and not heavy. The spicy, cheesy popcorn they put on the table when you arrive is an awesome touch!  They were out of the first several beers we tried to order. Food was decent- ahi tuna tostadas and lobster macaroni and cheese both could have used a spicy pick me up. On a second visit I'd stick to the burger menu- the Rising Sun burger was great, really flavorful sauce.   All in all a convenient stop for a bite if you're in the Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot of good things about this place. I wish I didn't hear it because my expectations were really high, and while the burgers here are pretty good, I wouldn't go wild over it. The manager was nice enough to allow a reservation for 19 people at 6 PM on a Saturday.  That's definitely a star well earned there.    The service was very good.  Warren took very good care of us and was so enthusiastic the whole time. I loved his excitement and spirit, and he was just on top of it.  There's another two star there.  I ordered the Gold Standard ($18) and added a fried egg ($1) and avocado ($2) and subbed my fries for sweet potato fries ($2).  I ordered it Medium Rare because I love my beef mooing and bloody at the same time.  My expectation was that it would come out that way.  20-30 minutes later we got our meals, and to my udder disappointment (or shall I say udder disappointment), my burger came out Medium Well.  Ewww.  Ground cardboard.  While the burger was still good, having it medium rare could have made it THAT much better and probably one of the best burgers.  So it was just good, not amazing.  I was not the only one in my group of 19 with this issue.  At least 5 others stated they also ordered their burgers medium rare and it came out Medium well to Well done, and the one guy who ordered it well got a medium or medium rare burger.  Um...that made no sense, but maybe the cooks were having an off day.  For $21 I was hoping for an orgasm in my mouth.        I didn't have any shakes because I'm not into shakes, but I had a lot of friends there who loved theirs.     I would rule this place completely out, but I can't give it bragging rights either.  I still prefer Red Robin  burgers over my experience at Holstein's and this was the consensus amongst my group.  Good burgers but poor execution.  I would try this place again just because they might have been having an off day, but in general, I'd still with Cheeseburger in Paradise or Red Robin.  We'll try again later, Holstein's!",

    "text": "For a quick meal + drink at The Cosmopolitan, Holsteins does the trick. Big caveat up front is that we dined at 11 pm and I didn't have a burger per se but still, it was a decent meal.   Because it was that late, service was speedy and attentive. The in-house DJ was a little loud though which made conversations a little tough. I really only needed a snack so I ordered a crispy pork belly slider (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=iFmsSniZf-3AgCH-ZYZakA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>), or tiny buns as they call them here. The fatty pork belly had a nice char on it and the pillowy steamed buns (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=MCPdx_nHJ4JSD0a_3LLQ3w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>) served as a great receptacle to handle said meat. I thought there was a heavy hand on the hoisin sauce but all in all it was a pretty good combination. My friend had the carbonara chicken burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=VQxHmfVC8yd988No1srqUw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>) and he thought it was alright.   They do have a good selection of beers here though. I started with the Tripel Karmeliet from Brouwerij Bosteels on tap and it was a crisp triple with hints of citrus, florals, and ummm banana (to me at least). Next I had a Leffe, also on tap. I thought the Leffe tasted a little off... as though it was slightly diluted but it might have been a result of the Karmeliet before.   All in all, if you want an elevated meat between two buns plus good booze, Holsteins is a good choice if you're at the Cosmopolitan.",

I didn't get to have dinner until 11pm and this was one of the few places in the hotel still open.  Boy it didn't disappoint! I had the Steakhouse Burger and some hand cut fries. Decided to skip the milkshakes and have a beer instead. Brooklyn Pale Ale did the job.  My coworker opted for the Classic and had no complaints.  Service was fast and friendly. Besides, it was 11pm on a Monday night and the place was practically empty. Ask for Justin!  Like most things in The Cosmopolitan, it's a bit on the pricier side. The bill for two can easily hit $50 and that's even before the booze. It's ok though because it was well worth it.  Be warned though...the place is LOUD (Marquee nightclub is across the hall plus the restaurant had it's own DJ.) Probably not the best place to try to have a quiet conversation....",

Billionaire burger: I wanted to try this because of the foie gras which mind you does not cover the whole burger. It is just a couple of bites before it's all gone with over half the burger left. The sauce is good but I don't think the burger is worth the price   The fries are average    Lobster Mac n' Cheese: I'd say this dish is poorly executed given that I could not taste the lobster    The Gold Standard is delicious...if you're going to order a burger that's the one. The flavors meld together perfectly. This is how a burger should be done.   There is a free beer when you check in on four square but it's not good at all. I'd pass on it even though it's free.",

    "text": "I was endlessly impressed with this quirky, classy Vegas Burger and Shake joint.  Our taxi driver suggested it when my girlfriend was craving chicken wings. We all did need a base layer before a hectic night out on the strip. Normally, if someome suggests a joint, I am left with limited things I tend to eat. I stood corrected in this case. We found the restaurant easily and were greeted by several friendly hostesses. The decor is funky and modern with strange pictures of pickle-people and cows. We sat at an oversized booth and as I started to look at the menu, I found my savior: The Urth Burger. That's right folks, a vegan burger.  My party got a few orders of chicken wings, a Caesar salad, Ahi tostadas and I ordered the Urth burger with sweet potato fries.  Warren was our server and he was friendly and very hospitable. Thanks to Yelp! I found out flavored rums were $4. The girls ordered a few cocktails and C and I stuck with waters.  We peppered Warren with questions about the area and tattoo parlors and he tried his best to help us. He did seem moderately overwhelmed so we were forgiving of his mild forgetfulness.  Our food came out and the presentation was gorgeous! My burger was massive and absolutely amazing. The patty had a perfect blend of spices to be flavorful, yet not overpowering and it was popped with a generous portion of avocado, sprouts, tomato and lettuce. It is definitely a veg heads burger! The drinks came out shortly after the food, which was a little unopportunistic but that is okay. I would love to give this place 5 stars, but the pace of dining is what killed it. I loved Warren as a server and it is not like we were in a massive hurry, but over 15 minutes for drinks from the time we ordered and about 8 minutes for our bill knocked it down a star. I would absolutely recommend it and plan to go back though!",

That was kind of the extent of what we ate and from that, I can definitely recommend the food.  We arrived around 6 on a Sunday night and were seated promptly.  Our server was attentive and kept my water full and the food came out very quickly.  When we ordered, there was a lot of up-selling and recommendations - but since we ordered so little, I guess that is to be expected.  But, overall, in our short, limited food experience, I had a good time and would return and/or recommend Holsteins to others.  In fact, I would definitely like to return to try some of those boozy shakes!",

Our waitress was not paying attention to our drinks and our waters would be empty for quite a while before she would come over to refill them. On one stop to refill them, she only refilled 2 out of 3 ice waters - leaving one of us with no drink!! She also did not pre bus the table, leaving dirty plates there when she should have taken them away. When it came time to pay the bill, she gave us the wrong bill. I was very frustrated with the terrible service and a $100 tab for sub par food and horrible service. I asked for the manager. He offered free milkshakes the next time we come there.

To start off, the place looks awesome, I sure they spent alot of money here (as they did on everything in the Cosmo) and it shows. There is plenty of street art, anime style graphics, along that old-world leather feel in the dining area. Its definitely falls into the stylish chic category. Plus that giant cow by the entrance looks cool!   Now for the food, its awesome. Everyone tries out the Gold Standard and for good reason - cheddar, arugula, garlic chive aoili all make for a awesome burger. My personal fave:  is the Rising Sun - juicy, perfectly cooked kobe beef burger with crispy yam, teriyaki glaze and spicy mayo, and tempura avocado!.  The shakes are delicious (they do have alcohol in em) with the best one being Drunken Monkey. All of the bamboozled shakes have alcohol but you can get virgin as well. Try one out, they are delicious!  But be warned ahead of time, its not cheap, nor quiet. For a burger, fries and shake you are easily going come out spending $30+. Come in on a monday or weekend and the place be packed and loud from everyone trying to get inside of Marquee.",

We order buffalo wings, which comes with a tiny amount of blue cheese dressing. The sauce was ok, and the actual wing was chewy and under cooked. Our burgers were just OK, there wasn't enough sauce or flavor on either burger. The fries were nothing special, some were cooked ok others were chewy and stale. We also had a banana something alcoholic shake, even the alcohol couldn't make this shake better than mediocre. The shake was just runny, none of the usual milk shake creamy thickness. Just an ok experience, I guess! The service was good though.   I think Burgers and Beers at the Venetian/Palazzo is still the best burger I have ever had.",

    "text": "Me and my wife came to the restaurant due to the recommendation of one of my co-workers who lives in Las Vegas ... since she's a total foodie, I trust her restaurant choices! Since all the reservations were taken during the weekend, we made one for Monday at 2pm. It was a great choice because the lunch rush was over and we were able to seat on a corner booth! The decoration caught me right away: fun cow drawings all over the place made it look like a fun spot not only for adults but also for kids! Our server came right away and told us to take as much time as needed since there were some interesting food and shake selections. He came shortly after with the pizza flavor popcorn. What an interesting flavor! I never thought about putting pizza flavor on popcorn, it gave it such an interesting taste!  OMG the shakes! I got the banana split (which was sweet and creamy) and the vegan coconut raspberry (she's lactose intolerant, so this shake was great for her. Extra points to Holsteins for having dairy free shake options!). The cool is that we got the excess shake, so more for us!  I got the The Rising Sun (great combination of Japanese flavors inside a burger, cool addition of the shredded sweet potatoes chips) and my wife got the  California Turkey (so juicy and light, the Russian dressing enhanced the flavor of the burger). Both burgers came with a side of crispy fries, super light that you wanted to keep eating them! No one rushed us, the server and busser were always checking if we needed something else, constantly filling our glasses with tap water and making sure we were comfortable. If you have a big appetite and want to taste the shake, get one shake and one burger. If you want to leave satisfied, share a shake and a burger. Totally worth it!!!",

The toppings on my burger were tasty and good but the burger itself was over cooked for ordering it medium and I wasn't very impressed. One other positive was a great pb choc milk stout beer that was on tap--that's the best craft selection that appealed to me on the Vegas strip our entire trip.

The veggie burger was not as good as I was expecting, I found it to be more of a mashed potato patty... with so many great options in the market I can't imagine why they did that.  My guest said his vanilla shake was one of the best he'd had but wished he'd asked for whipping cream on the side as it was too sweet and too much.  The fries were ok, but again for a burger shack I'd expect more.  Service was great and friendly and they had a nice beer/wine selection.  I'm sure they do some items very well but the veggie burger isn't it so if that's what you're looking for; keep looking.",

However I can certainly say coming back here after a year has hardly diminished how I feel about the place!  Came with my gf and our roommate and each had a shake. I had the Donutella (fantastic, Nutella goodness!) while my gf had Campfire S'Mores and my buddy had the Frozen Grasshopper. For food, my friend had The Classic, my gf had the Captain Hook, and I had the Gold Standard Burger.  Not one of us didn't enjoy what we had. It was amazing and surely worth every penny. Our server was great too! A real joy to have and had a great sense of humor. Overall, A+ place to go. A bit pricey, so won't be back until it's another \"special occasion\", but boy I can't wait for that day!",

Our waiter, Ricco, gave us great recommendations and was patient with our questions and was good to refill our drinks without us asking. You know you have a good staff when they are attentive to their patrons, whether they are slow or busy. Maybe I'm biased but I think our waiter was moving around the most servicing his tables!  We ordered a variety of things: 1. Sun rise burger - good Asian flavors that leaves your mouth wanting more. The Kobe beef (and Ricco made sure we knew it was American) just melts in your mouth with the first bite.   2. The fun-ghi burger - a really good take on mushroom swiss burger. It was so good that my mom ate the whole thing by herself and she typically doesn't finish burgers!  3. Gold standard burger - dry aged beef with cheese and bacon, what more could a hungry man ask for?!?! My dad enjoyed this dish and although he wasn't that hungry, he's taking the leftovers to eat in the room later.  4. The fries that come with burger are without a doubt my favorite type of fries...crispy and potatoey!  5. Campfire bamboozle. Ok...you must drink this shake! It's not super alcoholic, but I'm sure the alcohol will hit me later. Hahaha. Words cannot explain how fantastic this is!  Overall, an awesome place to eat if you want a burger in Vegas! Make sure you come and if you get Ricco as your waiter, you know you're well taken care of.",

I ordered the Fun-Ghi burger, 8 oz of beef cooked to the temp you like, perfectly seasoned and juicy, topped with mushrooms, gruyere cheese, frisee, and truffled mayo. It was huge!  You gotta try one of their shakes- most are \"spiked\" but you can order them alcohol free. We ordered the chocolate explosion shake- shake glass rimmed with frosting and chocolate crunchies, Oreo and brownies mixed into the shake, topped with a full brownie, whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I wanna try the S'mores shake next time.  The fries are shoestring cut and crispy. You can ask for their housemade Udder sauce to dip them in.  As an appetizer, we loved the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls.  Prices are about average for Vegas on the Strip. $15-20 average on the burger with fries, but worth the price.",

Al pastor burger 5/5 It had a juicy slice of pineapple and great guac. My only issue was the thick beef patty, but mainly because I'm a small girl with a decent appetite. If you're like me I would recommend you share the burger because half already had me full. But overall it was delicious.  Truffle lobster mac n cheese 5/5  It was mouth watering! I will definitely go back for more. Must try! Especially if you are a truffle fan. It was perfectly cheesy and creamy with good chunks of lobster.  For milkshakes I got...  Cookies n Cream 5/5 (w/o alcohol) I'm not a fan of crazy sweet desserts but this was perfect. Really cant go wrong with cookies and cream topped with dark and white chocolate crunchies adding great texture. They even give you the milkshake leftovers in an extra cup so you get your moneys worth. The ice cream sandwich on top was just any old sandwich, but looks great as decoration!  Water quality 4/5 Holsteins water was a solid 4/5. You can taste still taste the tap, but it wasn't overpowering like I have experienced before. It was bearable and enjoyable",

I ordered the Nom Nom burger and there was no sauce on the inside and the burger was dry and flavorless.   I decided not to splurge and buy a shake for $15 dollars, because ice cream should NEVER cost that much even if it does have lots of sprinkles and looks like a piece of art. It's still just ice cream and sprinkles.  The service was ok. Nothing special.   A major downside was this restaurant is fairly big and it only has one bathroom stall for men and another one for women. Go figure...because of the high traffic in the one stall for each gender, the bathrooms stayed filthy.",

    "text": "BIG fan of this spot.  Let me preface this by saying I enjoy my hamburgers.  I usually have one or two a week and can reflect on one summer where my two best friends and I did nothing but taste-test burgers one summer in the city and finally rated the top two that made our list.  Those were the days. Nowadays, as my tastes have refined and I've noticed that I prefer that the burger is a finer grind than a coarse grind or the bun makes or breaks. High maintenance, I know.  Hostein's takes burgers to a whole new level with their creative take on the standard Americana fare.  The last time I was here, I was torn between trying the Gold Standard (dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli ) but ended up trying the El Caliente (beef patty topped w/ pepper jack cheese, pickled jalapeno, avocado, pork chicharrones, & tequila-cilantro mayo) which was good with the varying textures but not spicy enough for me.  On another visit, tried their Steakhouse Burger ( beef patty crusted w/black pepper, mixed greens, holsteins creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, swiss cheese ) which I found very good, with the tomato confit and marmalade onions giving the savory patty just enough of a tang to balance out the overall taste.  We also ordered a few side dishes: Caesar Salad, Lobster Mac n' Cheese, and the Poutine.  My Caesar salad was very tasty but we would recommend passing on the Mac n' Cheese as it lacked flavor from the lobster.  However, the cheesiness of the dish was perfect. The french fries here are pretty damn good but the short ribs were a little dry.  The cheese and gravy made the french fry dish a notch better but overall, an ok dish.    Their bamboozled shakes were amazing.  Try their Grasshopper milkshake, the perfect blend between creamy mint and sweet chocolate bits perfectly ground and the liquor was just enough to make one aware,  but not throw off.  Location is in the uber trendy Cosmopolitan hotel and the whimsical anime approach to the interior brings a jolt of energy to this spot where the more stately take residence outside (Marquee entrance, for example).  The art reminds me of graffiti but on a enjoyable level, not to mention G-rated friendly.",

We had gotten in that night and didn't want to get all dolled up.   This place has a cornucopia menu filled with devilish treats that you know you shouldn't...but just HAVE to!   Taste: 9/10 Awesome burgers (one meat and one veggie), sweet potato fries on point, sinful shakes  Service: 10/10 Waitress didn't skip a beat, food came out very fast, super friendly and attentive. She made recommendations on her fav sauces, brought us out a steaming hot tower of fries when ours got cold.   Value: 8/10 For Vegas, pretty decent! The portions are big, food is good, it's just the city that makes your eyes pop a little at the number on the menu   Location:  In the Cosmopolitan! Perfect location!  All in all, very chill and casual, stomach filling, temptation satisfying eats!",

    "text": "TLDR: Overpriced burgers and shakes, complimentary spiced popcorn, free 10oz draft lager with yelp-check-in and burger purchase, adequate customer service, happy hour in lounge area from 3p-6p  I recently went to visit this location on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino. They do accept OpenTable reservations, so i decided to make a reservation. I was fortunate that I did because the restaurant seating did fill up on a Wednesday. I decided to order the Urth (vegan) burger as it was the cheapest burger on the menu. I redeemed my free 10oz Holstein's lager check-in and enjoyed it while eating the complimentary spiced popcorn. I had about 1.5 buckets worth and really enjoyed it a little too much, but maybe I was hungry.  I did try my friends' alcoholic and non-alcoholic shakes. Unfortunately, their \"world-famous\" shakes haven't made it around to Las Vegas because I would settle for a Sonic or In-n-out shake compared to theirs. It was beautifully presented, and they did give you the extra remaining cup; however, it was just a-ok. Nothing special about it. I will mention that my friend did order the chocolate shake with double shots, and the alcohol taste was barely a semblance in the drink. I would recommend finding your alcohol elsewhere.   The good thing about this location is that you can mix and match your burger with added cheeses and sauces, so you can order a Vegan burger on a different burger style in the menu. I did not opt for cheese, but I did opt for the aioli and spicy ranch with my fries. Without the sauces, the burger would not have been flavorful. I will compliment the vegan burger for not having any tree nuts or peanuts in the burger (as claimed by the waitress) and if there were any, then I didn't taste it. This allows for the facility to be allergen free for my hypersensitive friends.   Overall, I would recommend coming here for a fancy happy hour before 6pm and try out the location's appetizers and beers. Otherwsie, stick to a yard house.",

The staff is usually friendly and helpful with the menu. Service is decent and quick at the bar.  Aside from the milkshakes (the regular chocolate was good too), the burgers are delicious. I believe I've had The Gold Standard Burger, which, along with the fries and a pint, made for a great meal. Good presentation on the food and drinks, too.  Prices are standard for the Strip.

As such, I don't expect an average burger to be $15-$17.  As for the ambiance- very cute and trendy. Front half is loud and smokey, back half is quiet and intimate. Take your pick.   They also serve a popcorn at your table. I knew it tasted familiar but couldn't put my finger on it...it was pizza flavored popcorn. Interesting.  We ordered the following:  1. Buffalo Chicken Dip- it was ok. We ordered some ranch to go with it and it made it much better. I would recommend that.  2. El Caliente burger- I didn't have it, but I was told it was excellent by my dinner companion. No real feedback to offer.  3. Fun-Ghi Burger- it lacked all of the flavor I was expecting it to have. That was a bummer. It wasn't bad, it was just basic. For $18 I expect better than basic and a lot more flavor. The beef was a good selection, it was cooked perfectly at medium, it just lacked flavor. 4. Fries were ok 5. Onion rings with panko break crumbs were good but also lacked flavor  Like I said if it weren't pricey I'd give it 4 but I expect an $18 burger to be much more favorable. With all of the options for good food in Vegas I wouldn't go back.",

This was a big let down for me- most of the noise was coming from the bar area. Maybe a partition to help with the noise is needed?  I try not to eat much meat and luckily they offer veggie sliders. They were pretty dry and fell apart so it was difficult to eat them.  Service was just ok for me. The more busy they became, the less we were checked on.   Now for the best part- the Shakes! So many to chose from. Be nice and share with your table mates. :) They were so flavorful. Just like the menu described them to be.  For me- I'll pass on the Holsteins and have more of the shakes.",

Huge portion in each cup. Very delish,  just right sweetness for my taste.  Billionaire burger $32: kobe beef, foei gras, port onion marmalede, trifee, trufle mayo.

They give you spiced popcorn instead of bread with the meal; I got refills both times I went since it was so tasty!   I highly recommend the shakes.  I had the Nutella crunch shake and it was amazing. Super thick and chocolaty, and the crunchy bits made it even more memorable.  You can add extra shots of alcohol too ;)  Although the shakes are pricey, they give you a large glass for the shake, plus the extras.  The first time I got the shake the extras were almost enough to refill the entire glass again!  Although the burgers are good, it's the shakes that made me want to go out of my way to go back to Holstein's.     Thanks to my fellow yelpers, I decided to try the lobster mac & cheese.  It's a small portion, but since it is so rich I would not have wanted any more.  It's worth trying if you're a fan of lobster, mac & cheese, and truffle.  However, it wasn't amazing so you're not missing out if you give it a pass.  The burgers are good as well.  Again, I thought they were overpriced but it was very enjoyable.  The black pepper crusted burger was very peppery and the bold flavors were unique.  I think the choice of burgers comes down to a personal preference.   Holstein's is located inside The Cosmopolitan, and has a bar, lounge seated area, and normal restaurant tables.  It has a casual vibe.",

The presentation of the burger looks very appetizing but the taste was just overpowering because every thing was too creamy and rich since it had a mayo-truffle sauce in it. I think it needed something to complement the creaminess and the rich flavor of foie gras like something fruity, sour/ tart flavor like a pickle or balsamic reduction. They could just omit the mayo-truffle sauce instead. Asides from that, the beef patty and shakes were good.",

I wouldn't say they're authentic Chinese, but it came pretty close and was delicious in its own way.  I also had the ahi poke appetizer, a small dish of raw tuna salad. I wouldn't recommend this appetizer for more than one person considering its small size, but it was really good. I felt as though the dish could have a little more of that chilli mayo sauce on the side. I recall it being just two drops for the whole dish. You don't need a whole lot, but maybe two additional drops would've satisfied my senses.",

I guess I was expecting an amazing hamburger and it was just very regular. I didn't enjoy the bun at all and felt the toppings were a bit lacking. I ordered the \"Bull-gogi Burger\" and was expecting a flavor explosion, but it just wasn't. Just a little blander than I was expecting. Still a pretty tasty burger cooked well, but nothing I'm dying to go back and try again. My black cow alcoholic float was pretty good, but honestly I think I would have preferred it without alcohol. The fries were so-so. I got the steak fries, but they were really more like wedges and I wasn't really a fan of the seasoning. I tried my fella's skinny fries and preferred them.   It was my friend Ryan B's birthday, so we received a free round of jell-o shots and a plethora of outrageous desserts that none of us had room to eat. I tried the carrot cake and the funnel cake and they left a lot to be desired. They just didn't pack the punch I had been hoping. There were interesting, but if you're going to be interesting at least try to make them tasty. The carrot cake was shaped like a carrot and was a super cute concept albeit somewhat phallic. It was paired with carrot ice cream, but I really wasn't feeling it. The funnel cakes were topped with ground up cereal, but I would have preferred a fruit or creamy topping.  All in all, the service was amazing. Our servers were friendly and very helpful. That alone raised their star-rating. As for the food, it's pretty standard. The burger was pretty good, maybe if I tried different toppings, it would be better.",

The poke was $15 and had small cuts of fresh fish on top of mini round tortilla chips. Both burgers were about $20 and they were not as tender and juicy as we anticipated.  Holsteins is pretty pricey for what they are plating. I spent the same amount I would have spent if I had gone to Wicked Spoon.  But because of the quick service, hip ambience, and bottomless popcorn, we will probably be back for a beer or two; we will pass on the food.",

    "text": "Boyfriend ordered the billionaire burger, and I ordered the gold standard.   The billionaire burger was definitely the better of the two... which I expected since its almost a whopping $10 more. The foie gras and truffle aioli is what made it good though but for $27... I could just get 2 truffle burgers from Umami and be full as hell and be twice as truffled-out.  Gold standard was underwhelming. First, it was cooked well--no pink in the center whatsoever... when I ordered medium rare. Meat itself wasn't that flavorful for being dry aged sirloin.... bacon was pretty lame, and the \"goat cheddar\" was kind of lackluster. Tomato confit and garlic aioli must have been pretty skimpy since my burger was overall pretty dry.  Otherwise, service was alright and decor is cute and finding a table was a breeze during mid-saturday lunch.   So while the billionaire burger was good and the gold standard wasn't BAD, they still are pumped with vegas hype so I can't justify spending that much on a burger that I could top for even less $$ somewhere closer to home. For the price of the gold standard, I could basically get 3 sammies at Earl of Sandwich.. which sounds a lot tastier as well.  Tip.. Check-in on 4square for a free house lager or margarita. House lager tasted pretty weaksauce. Margarita was whatever.",

    "text": "(Review is for milkshakes only) came here because I've heard a lot about the milkshakes, after looking at the menus in the bar/lounge area we noticed the shakes weren't listed on there, we had to grab the hostess (who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers) and ask if we can see a full menu.  After agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  We sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.  The hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so I just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself.  By this point I was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake.  We ordered the Fat Boy and the Vegan Maple Pecan, it took a while for 2 shakes but after trying it, it was worth the wait.  A few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake, it was actually a vanilla shake.  So pretty much they delivered the extra/leftover vanilla shake to a vegan...who drank it not realizing it was non vegan =( I understand there's a chance of getting non-vegan items at a Restaraunt that's not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it.  Good shakes though.",

We each ordered burgers, but I didn't think anything was special about it.  I also had onion rings.   I was a bit annoyed when I asked if I could have half onion rings, and half fries.  The waiter replied \"We won't customize anything here.  Even if you wanted your burger cut in half, we would just give you a knife.\"  That for me makes me give Holsteins 3 stars.  I had the grass hopper milk shake as well (with an extra shot).  The problem with service being so slow, was that by the time the food came, I had pretty much finished the milk shake and was quite full.  Overall, Holsteins is not very memorable, and I would rather go to BURGR or Burgar Bar.  There clearly was a reason why Hosteins had no wait, and the other burger places did.",

Good thing they had something I was craving.  The Fun-ghi: beef patty topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese, frisee, & truffle mayo. $17.50 The Forager burger: Kobe beef & mushroom blended burger, mixed greens, creamy steak sauce, fried egg, tomato confit, marmalade onions, & Swiss cheese. $18 Belching beaver peanut butter milk stout 16 oz. $11 Dogfish head flesh & blood IPA 16 oz. $10  Whatever we ordered was so amazing. I would probably order the fun-ghi again. I'm not a huge fan of a sunny side up egg in my burger because I feel like I would spill all of the yolk and waste food. That's just my two cents. I thoroughly enjoyed my peanut butter stout, it's my favorite.  TL;DR If you're of age you have to get a beer with the burger. It washed down everything. If not they have adult (alcoholic) milkshakes. I didn't try it though because I think I would've been too sweet and I think I would've been too full.",

It was more so a quick place to grab some appetizers. While we were sitting there waiting for our food we were eying up the burgers that went by and they did look pretty amazing.   When we were seated they brought out some complementary popcorn to the table which tasted a lot like white cheddar (my favorite). We ordered the mac n cheese and philly egg rolls. I was the most excited about the mac n cheese and let me tell you it did not disappoint! It was mixed with a mascarpone cheese and topped with bread crumbs. If you are going to get an appetizer do not sleep on this one. The philly egg rolls I was not to excited about. They were a bit greasy and filled with more cheese than steak.   Overall, I felt like the appetizers were definitely on the pricer side our bill was $38 for 2 appetizers and a pop. The mac n cheese is worth it, but if I had to do it over again I would definitely get a burger.",

    "text": "Holsteins is a pretty chill place. It was a great spot to hang out after roaming the strip for a while and craving some burgers.   We decided to order the billionaire burger and fries. We decided on the Billionaire burger since it was topped with foie gras. It also has truffle mayo and some onion marmalade. I was hoping the foie gras would be of stronger taste. Burger was juicy but a bit over cooked and the burger bun was a lot. Being that there was a lot of bun, it was easy to use the bread of the burger to ask up the flavors that dripped onto your plate. The fries were pretty good but nothing that wow'ed me.. just fries. Being that they also serve shakes, we decided to order also order one. We shared a creme brulee shake. That was not that good. I'm not sure if it was the mixture of the alcohol and the cream but maybe these two shouldn't go together.. ever.   Tip: Located in the cosmo",

Definitely something that could be split between 2-3 people. We each ordered a burger, the caprese and the mushroom, and split them. The Caprese was the better burger, but both were great. The sweet potato and regular fries were both amazing! Overall, Holsteins is a fun stop if you're looking for boozy shakes, burgers and fries",

    "text": "WOW! Wanna talk about good hamburgers and milkshakes? Holstein's is a burger restaurant inside a strip casino, The Cosmopolitan. As a local I and most locals avoid the strip like the plague. But, I am telling you, Holstein's is good enough that I will dare the strip to eat there.   I went for the \"Gold Standard\"   GOLD STANDARD* / 18.5 DRY AGED BEEF SIRLOIN BURGER W/ SMOKED BACON,  AGED GOAT CHEDDAR CHEESE, TOMATO CONFIT,  BABY ARUGULA, & GARLIC-CHIVE AIOLI  This burger is one of the tastiest I have ever had. All of the ingredients are perfectly balanced and all come out in full flavor. The size of the burger is perfect. Not too big not too small. If you want fries you have to order them \"ala cart\" (separate) which is honestly the only negative thing I can say about Holstein's. The burger and fries together will run you $25 bucks. The fries are also just as good as the burgers and come on a full plate, enough for two people. You will not be dissatisfied.   Last are the alcohol infused \"Bam Boozled\" milk shakes. The shakes are HUGE with just the right amount of \"Booze\" to make them Bamboozled. I tried the Fat Boy.  THE FAT BOY / 15 CHOCOLATE-KARAMEL VODKA, REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS,  PRETZELS, RAINBOW SPRINKLES, FROOT LOOPS, OREO COOKIES,  BUTTERFINGER, CHOCOLATE COVERED PRETZEL STICK, RAINBOW TWIST POP, COTTON CANDY, VANILLA FROSTING, MICRO JAWBREAKERS  If you are visiting Las Vegas you gotta try this place. If you are a local you gotta try this place. It's worth it.",

Got the Nom Nom burger and fries which was good a pretty simple burger with cheese and chips in it and also got a Caesar salad which was also good.

    "text": "First off, i absolutely give this place 5 STARS! Their burgers and shakes are awesome!!  This review goes to the next day, 02/10/14, ( yes we went two days in a row because it was that damn good!).  It was busier than the previous day, which is totally fine.  However, I am giving a couple of the waiters that \"helped\" us 1 star.  The hostess was awesome and sat us down right away.  After sitting there for ten minutes we were ready to order (i recommend the Rising Sun).  The waiter, this was around 5 pm, went to EACH table and assisted them.  Our menus were down and closed which is an indication that we were ready.  He did not even introduce himself or asked us if we wanted drinks...nothing.  We waited another 5 minutes assuming that he was going to get back to us after getting drinks for the other table.  Still nothing.  Only until the 3rd time he came back to our section did he notice us.  We're not those high maintenance couples that need acknowledgement every single time, but he didn't apologize for the wait or even introduce himself.  He just asked if we were ready.  Well, we're not in Denny's, we're paying $18 per burger plus other things so I do want decent service.   We didn't order, but asked to move to the front of the restaurant (to get better service there).  Of course, he said yes, but told us to grab our utensil and napkins....thanks guy for becoming even more of an ass.  I wish I knew his name, but like I said, he never introduced himself. Moving to the front was a good choice because the waitress in the front was very kind and got our orders right away.  Also, the men in all black who bring out the food and drinks are very nice as well.  Our waitress was getting off work and said that Wendy will be taking over and that's when it went down hill AGAIN! She came over to introduce herself and told us that if we needed anything to ask her.  Well, I asked for some refills and she looked shocked at what I asked.  Maybe it was my imagination, who knows.  After about 20-30 minutes, we were about done eating.  She helped the new comers around us, but would always pass us.  We assumed that she was busy, so we let that go.  Finally she came and asked if we wanted desserts, but after burgers and shakes, it was enough.  We declined and she walked away.  This is where it became highly irritating (along with the first waiter). We declined on the desserts and our plates/glasses were empty, so that's an indication that we were done.  It's pretty common sense that we didn't want more and we would like the check.  We were waiting for about ANOTHER 20 minutes for nothing.  We saw her just standing there talking to her other coworkers.  I didn't know I had to raise my hand for help or go up to her for the check, which i didn't do.  Like I said, we are in an establishment where we were paying close to $80-$100 for two people and I am not going to walk to the register to pay.  She FINALLY came and asked if we wanted the check. (Yeah, we wanted our check 20 min ago.)   I LOVE this place and awesome work to the other 2 waitresses who served us well.  The other two just need some improvements.",

We were looking for something relaxed for our first dinner in Vegas and did a Yelp search for \"burger.\" The Gordon Ramsey \"BURGR\" joint was packed, so we headed to Holstein's, located in the Cosmopolitan.   We had about a 20 minute wait, though we got there around 9:00pm. They text you when your table is ready, which conveniently allows you to wander around the hotel for a bit. Service was great - very friendly. We liked the popcorn that is provided before the meal - tasted a bit like ranch, but apparently was salt and vinegar.  I ordered the \"Rising Sun\" burger; my partner the \"El Machete.\" I think the Rising Sun might have been more successful if they hadn't doused the patty (which was cooked to a perfect, almost medium rare \"medium\") with so much sauce (minus one star). I love salt, but even that was too much for me. The El Machete burger was also very good, with a quiet heat going on in the background thanks to a couple of mellowed Anaheim chiles.  If we'd be hungrier, we might have sprung for one of the boozy shakes, which sounded lovely.",

The service was very friendly... creepy at times??? But they were awesome, prompt, and quick to everything. They kept us super satisfied.   For the burgers, I got the Korean Bull Gogi... fun to say and fun to eat. It has a delicious, juicy patty, egg, kimchi, and a spicy mayo. DISCLAIMER.... NOT A FIRST DATE FOOD. Only for those who are in love and have no problem getting a little messy for your partner.... or if you're just going out with friends. Besides the mess... wow its a good burger. The egg is left a little runny (I spilled it all over the table:[). The kim chi and the spicy mayo blended perfectly together. I ate the whole thing without regret.   My boy got the burger with brisket on it.. I forget what it was called, but we didn't talk much during our meal because we were busy stuffing our faces. I looked up once after finishing my half, and his was gone!   We opted out on the shake, but we did get the \"Candy Store\" plate. It was pretty fun, but I prefer a bigger, more unified dessert. It had a mini dessert, and allowed your mouth to sample a variety of sweets. Pineapple/coconut tapioca (mmm), custard donut with coffee/chocolate syrup for dipping, mystery fruit jellies, chocolate custard push-pop, a mini chocolate dipped ice cream cone with banana ice cream, and the most exciting Nitrogen infused meringues. The waitress was sure to let us know you could blow smoke at your nose while eating them,   The dessert was fun and different, but I'm not sure I would recommend it for the price.   My experience at Holstein's leaves me with the impression of being able to return... but only on occasion as it is kinda pricey.",

    "text": "I love the energy here.  It's lively and has a DJ spinning on weekend nights.  The space and menu are creative and stylish.  Holstein's is a restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes.   There's pretty much something for everyone including bar food and different variations of your popular burgers.  Come prepared to pay strip prices though.  Burger and fries will set you back $15 - $20 with no alcohol not included.   I've been here a few times and have had the following: -  Caesar Salad:  Delicious -  Bucket of Buffalo Wings:  Best I've ever had -  California Turkey:  The patty was good and juicy; however, bland in flavors with a greasy bun. -  The Gold Standard:  Again, the patty was cooked very well and was juicy.  The overall burger was way to greasy. -  Key Lime Pie Shake:  Delicious -  Creamsicle Float:  Not a fan -  Oreo Shake:  Not enough Oreo's! -  Fries:  Good, not great.  So far, the food has been hit and miss for me.  The service isn't anything to write about either.  Especially at the bar... in fact, don't expect good service there.    Overall, I would continue to go back and have Holstein's again in the future.  Although I tend to think there are better burger options at under $15 a meal and $15 a shake in Vegas.",

I sat at the bar by myself, and the brunette-long-hair bartender seemed to know how tough it is for a girl to sit by herself. So she was extremely sweet and helpful to me. She was chilled, but you know that she is very serious about customer service. Yes, in addition, anybody who calls me sweetie is automatically considered to give good service in my book!         However, the food and the drinks were not on par with the good service. I ordered two cocktails: upside down pineapple birthday cake and tropical splash. The drinks were beautiful but weak. I know that it was in the morning and kind of early to get buzzed, but I am in Vegas so what?           For food, I ordered the billionaire burger. I really LOVE...the name of this burger. Yes, paying $28.00 to supposedly eat like a billionaire. Why not? Another reason is that it kind of feeds my delusion of wealth. I love every single ingredient listed for the burger: Kobe beef, foie gras, truffle mayo, caramelized onion, but I do not love the burger together. It felt as it needs some kind of sauce to bring it together, just a suggestion.           Overall, I would come back here for the atmosphere and the service. But the drinks and the burger were absolutely not the best.",

We just went to get the boozy milkshakes I'd seen all over the internet. They are delicious, but huge! I recommend sharing, if you aren't used to lots of sweets. One of the shakes I saw being delivered had an entire ice cream sandwich on top (wish I would have tried that one). All shakes are topped with lots of extra treats like marshmallows, chocolate, meringues, candy, etc. Definitely worth the stop!    The shakes are a little speedy (about $14), but it's Vegas.  We went at 2pm and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table. Either make a reservation, go early, or be prepared to wait!",

    "text": "#11 of 2017  There are so many restaurants on the strip, how do you choose?! Yelp of course! Do your research, bookmark a bunch of places, then try as many as you can! This is how I roll on vacations and it's turned out pretty good so far!  Looking at burger places in Las Vegas, this one immediately caught my eye because of their \"bamboozled shakes\" made with alcohol. Sign me up!  Their innovative takes on the classic burger and fries made this choice a no brainer.   The restaurant is located on the second floor above the casino level neighboring their retail shops. We were immediately greeted and given a choice if he lounge or the dining room. The noise level in the lounge was a little too high for our liking, but this area would be great if you're coming off the casino floor just to have their shakes.   FOOD: Everything we tried was foodgasmic!! The poutine had a soy sauce-tasting gravy that was made from a stout beer cooked down and reduced to perfection. My burger wasn't over cooked, the tempura avocado gave the burger the creaminess it needed to balance the spicy aoli and the teriyaki sauce. So good! The shakes are so decadent! I normally don't advise sharing, but this is the one exception.  Share! Check out my pictures and you'll see why.   SERVICE: This is where I think Holsteins has some opportunities to better their business. Our server was nice, she gave her recommendations (fried pickles, fat boy shake) and was quick in giving us our drinks. After seeing other diners with their bucket of popcorn on their tables even before they ordered, we had to ask our server for ours after our appetizer came out. Towards the end of the meal she disappeared and some random bus boy with a broom and dustpan brought our check to our table. Wth?! After our shakes, our server only refilled one of our glasses of water, leaving the other three empty. What gives?!   Overall the food outweighed the spotty service. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We wound up here after waiting for 20min in the EggSlut line around the corner and realizing that the 50+ person line wasn't moving. Although Holsteins didn't exactly fit the 'brunch' bill, we were starving and able to get a table without a wait, so definitely a win there.  Things started out well, with a friendly server and free creamy dill popcorn, which we polished off in seconds. Everyone ordered a burger and a shake or two for the table as we admired the massive, decorated, boozy shakes at the tables around us. My friend with the strawberry shake raved about it- with fresh strawberries and they even delivered the extra in the metal cup it was made in- again, promising start to a meal!  It was the burgers, however, that really let the meal down. Although we all ordered medium cooked burgers, what we were delivered ranged from rare to well-done. Also, all burgers lacked seasoning, and even the toppings didn't save the flavor. You know you have an issue when even an al pastor-style meat preparation lacks flavor! Since we waited, hungry, for our burgers for 20 min after ordering, no one was willing to send their burgers back so we scarfed them down, though this questionable meal came to haunt us later as my friend with the rarest burger became sick from the raw meat later that afternoon. I'm sorry, but food poisoning is definitely the nail in the coffin for this review. Lesson learned: when in Vegas, plan ahead and make reservations for brunch.",

    "text": "PARKING + AMBIENCE You can self-park in the Cosmopolitan garage. It's usually packed, but it's free parking. The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan near Marquee and Eggslut. Restaurant decor has the cow mascot plastered on the walls. The ambience is nice and noisy, as expected of Vegas.  FOOD I got the Rising Sun burger ($18). It has a Kobe beef patty with teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. The Kobe beef was cooked well, I got it medium done. The burger was oozing with flavor and quite enjoyable. All burgers come with fries, but they were forgettable. Complementary popcorn is available and you can ask for free refills. The popcorn had a BBQ flavor to it.   SERVICE Good customer service by our server. We were frequently, but not overbearingly, checked to make sure everything was going good. Our server also allowed us to split the check individually, making it easier for us to pay for our meals.   CONCLUSION The burgers are expensive, similar to any gourmet burger place in Vegas. In my opinion, I'm not sure it's worth it, but it never hurts to try something new. My Kobe beef was cooked well, but my friend's beef didn't match the same quality. On the plus side, it was a filling meal. Complementary popcorn was also a good gesture on their part and left us satisfied. So while I probably won't be back, overall, they are an alright establishment for gourmet burgers.",

Not the restaurants fault , but they maybe need another way to communicate    We got seated and it took about 10 min. to have someone  our drink order.  The good was ok tasting I got the Vegatarian Burger,  although I made a modification to  mine  the cooks got it wrong.  I requested cucumber slaw instead of cucumbers and I never recieved the slaw .  And they kept the cucumber  .  They did how ever remember my pineapple slice.  The menu stated avacado , so I was exspecting avacado slices and it was all mashed , I could barely taste it.   Hubby got the Millionare burger , his said it was ok , but not really impressed. .  My son had a burger , he said it was good.   My one other big complaint was I ONLY got a refill on my drink 5 min. before we left. We could not track down our server for the whole 45 min we were seated and she never came by ONCE to check us.

    "text": "I was in Vegas for The Killers concert (my fave band!) and because I have family there. As I was chatting with my boss before I left work that Friday, she recommended Holsteins for dinner while I was in Vegas. I looked them up on Yelp and I was sold! Burgers and fries are my absolute fave! Plus those shakes looked totally amazing!   My cousin was generous enough to take me there before the concert. I had never been inside the Cosmopolitan before, even though I've been to Vegas many times. I loved the elegant, chic, girly decor everywhere. And they have a Chelsea tower/ballroom. How cool is that?!  We made our way to Holsteins and it wasn't too busy at all. Just pretty steady for a Monday night. We had made reservations but probably didn't need them. After we sat down I knew I had to have one of those shakes!! Now I know Holsteins is known for their boozy shakes, but I've had a boozy shake elsewhere before and I was not impressed. It was like the alcohol ruined the taste of the actual shake! So I asked the server if I could order a shake sans alcohol and he said yes (it's $3 cheaper---in my opinion it should be like $5 cheaper but whatevs). I knew from the Yelp pictures that I wanted the cookies and cream! The shake came out relatively quickly (I'm used to SteaknShake where it takes 20 minutes to get your shake). I took one sip and LOVED it!! You can tell that it's not just over the top quantity over quality (which is what I was thinking it would be). Nope not at all...this shake had great tasting quality ice cream! It was almost like ice cream with a little frozen custard mixed in. I absolutely loved the flaky Oreo cookies in there. They also give you the leftover shake in addition to the shake in the fancy glass. It was absolutely delicious!  For dinner, I ordered the classic burger and requested no lettuce/tomato/onion. It was good/decent. Nothing really to write home about. There were a lot of pickles on there which was good. I was disappointed because I ordered medium well and it was still pretty red on the inside. Luckily I'm not the kind of person who is picky about meat temperatures. I ordered it with cheddar cheese and was hoping the cheese would be melting on top of the burger. But it almost looked like they threw it on top of the burger for only a few seconds before serving it. I don't like when the edges of the cheese are sticking out and not melted to the burger. (See picture). The fries were totally average. Again, nothing I'd ever rave about.   Overall, burgers and fries alone, this place is a solid three. Very average. But because of the delicious fancy shake, they get bumped up to a 4. I'm glad I went and would definitely go back again but only for a shake.",

We had a reservation but there wasn't much of a need for one at the time we showed up, around 7:00 on a Thursday. I got the Gold Standard Burger, which is their award winning burger, but I changed it to the wagyu beef and added tempura avocado on it. It was delicious! The meat was super juicy and tender, the avocado was delicious as well. It was well worth it. I also go the Cesar salad as well as sweet potato fries, they weren't anything crazy but it was good. The burger is where it's at. I also go the Oreo Milk Shake and it was very giant. The milkshake comes with an entire ice cream sandwich on top! It's quite expensive though, it's $15 for a milkshake. I'm not sure I would get it again, it was very rich, I definitely could not finish it. I would have rather gotten another burger in place of the milkshake. I would come back for sure for a burger.",

    "text": "Being the beer (and hamburger) lovers that my friends and I are, we decided to pay a visit to the often praised Holsteins Shakes and Buns.  I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the food.  Thankfully, some good craft beer made up for this.    We started with a bucket of popcorn, which seems to be a gastropub sort of trend these days in Vegas.  Popcorn is popcorn, and by that measure I guess it was good.  I ordered the bulgolgi burger ($16.50).  I expected an interesting flavored ala Bachi burger.  What I got was a mediocre burger, unfortunately. Although I ordered it medium rare, it came medium well.  The patty was dry, and the buns seemed a little hard as well.  I ordered the steak fries, which were drenched in saltiness.  I was thankful for this though because I tasted a skinny fry, and it was crunchy and over fried.    While Holstein's burgers were a let down for the price, the beer selection for me was redeeming. While not the best beer offering in Vegas (or The Strip for that matter), they did have Lagunitas IPA and Firestone Walker Pale Ale on draft.  The bottle selection was pretty decent.    All in all there are a couple of better burger/beer places on The Strip.  I can't say that I will be back to Holsteins.",

Hmmmm, I thought...I've had many Veg burgers and wanted to be the judge of that!  ...He was right! It really was a great patty that didn't fall apart all over my plate like some other places and it was seasoned quite well. I got this burger with fries, which were great too. Although I was quite full, I just had to try the Oreo Milkshake made with Bailey's Irish Cream and YUM it was really great! The service was great, the restaurant is busy and exciting, and the food is super yummy! I want to try the vanilla twinkie cake next time!   Tip: Don't search for the hashtag #holsteins on instagram....as you will find a bunch of baby cows, mama cows, and cute cows of all ages!! Holstein is a kind of cow, and a REALLY cute kind at that! Fortunately, I had the Urth burger so no guilt here",

Second time here, I had the ahi-sliders, which comes with seared ahi tuna, asian slaw and chili mayo. I asked for mine without the slaw because I don't want that extra gas while lounging later haha. But yes, even without the slaw, those sliders are delicious! I really like the chili mayo that it comes with it. I ordered sweet potato fries, which was a bit bland, but those mayo definitely spiced it up. I also ordered a redbull vodka here, and boy, it's pretty strong stuff.   The waitresses here are all very nice and cute. Their outfit kind of reminds me of Hooters except with longer shorts. There'are restaurant seating in the back and lounge seating in the front, both where you can order drink and food of course. The place is pretty well-lit and hip. It's great for hanging out.",

    "text": "Passed this place on a few trips to Vegas, on our way to the Wicked Spoon, but never got in there till this trip. Very nice restaurant, great staff, nice room. I took the advice of my fellow yelpers, and had to try it out. When you are at your table, they bring you popcorn to munch on. That was a different and fun choice. They have a menu of alcoholic shakes. We had to try the Tiramasu shake, because it had Mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger crumbs, patron XO cafe dark, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, espresso beans. I never even heard of marscapone ice cream!! It was delicious (and filling). We got the Cuban Street Tacos to start. That was great. They came with beans that were out of this world. Then I got the Rising Sun burger-Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado. Delicious! Hubby got the Gold Standard burger-Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli. Also very good. He got fries, I got the onion rings. BEST onion rings we have ever had. OMG. Overall great place. Would visit again. HOWEVER, I see everyone here comparing Holsteins to Gordon Ramsey Burgr and there is NO comparision. GORDON IS THE KING. His burgers, shakes, and fries are unmatched. And we have had alot of burgers and shakes on this trip. Time stops when you are eating a Gordon burger. (please see my review). We went there twice on this trip. Its our first stop off the plane.",

    "text": "Ok so to start of the place is nicely designed and very hip. This is the only reason i even chose to give it a star.  The Menu is sharp and creative.  Holstein's is a burger bar and restaurant but are best known for their extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes which at $15+ each are tasty but a little hard to swallow.  We had 4 people for dinner, the total was $160 and it was to say the least, one of the worse burgers I have ever eaten...EVER.  I started off and had a milk shake which was good, a little hard to swallow at $12 but at least it tasted good. We ordered the BILLIONAIRE BURGER $28 Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo and the GOLD STANDARD Burger   $17.5 Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. I told our slightly slow server several time MAKE SURE THE BURGERS ARE MEIDUM-RARE.    After a 40 minute wait time, the burgers arrived, and they looked AMAZING.   I took my first bite and was unpleasantly surprised by the rapid sizzle of the skin on the roof of my mouth. Slightly alarmed by the burning feeling I removed the bun to see what was going on.  The entire roof of my mouth was burned on a quarter size piece of foie-gras in my burger.  Apparently NO ONE bothered to consider learning how to prepare foie-gras before apply for a job at Holsteins and instead fried the hell out of it in a pan.  My rather nicely sized $30 burger had a piece of foie-gras on it that was the size of a quarter and burned.    What I received was far from a medium-rare burger.  The greasy, oily and hard to swallow burger was far from delicious and even further away from edible.  I asked the server if this was a joke and showed him the inside of the burger I had taken one bite of.   Confused and surprised, he apologized and said he will be back. After waiting for 10 minutes he returned and apologized mentioning that the \"Size of Fie-Gras varies in each burger\"  ....the question is by how much?    In an effort to make the most out of this horrible ordeal, I ordered a piece of foie-gras to place on my burger and requested they don't fry the hell out of it.  The server told me that it would be $20 extra which I told him was clearly not a problem. It arrived 20 minutes later once the burger was cold.  Once again it arrived burned to a brown color and tasted almost as bad as my now cold and tasteless $30 burger.   To be fair the place is very cute and well designed, the staff is polite but slow and poorly trained.    The service is sub fast-food quality.  Our server was slow and didn't take orders very well.     Overall, I would never go back and have Holstein's again unless it was for a $15 milk shake which was good but sadly not good enough.",

My kids were happy but at the end I was wanting more.  When you are first seated you are given a bucket of popcorn.  The seasoning on it was amazing, full of flavor.  The corn they delivered us that night was a little on the burnt side.    The meal arrived and while the burger was good, the fries were just ordinary.  I know you can upgrade your fries, I would suggest this if you go.  I ordered the Gold Standard, no complaints, but I have had better.    My kids ordered the chicken fingers and mini burgers off of the kids menu.  They were all overcooked, chicken fingers were burnt on the ends, hard and dark brown.  Mimi burger was too over done for my 6 year old.    The most amazing part of the meal was the shake which is the only reason this restaurant got three stars instead of two.  We ordered the S'mores shake without alcohol.  The marshmallow on top of the shake was worth the trip alone.  The whipped cream on the shake was equally amazing.   If you were anywhere except Las Vegas this would be way too expensive a meal for a hamburger and shake.  However, the high cost is just paying the rent at the trendy Cosmopolitan Hotel.  I would most definitely go back for a shake, but would pass on the rest of the meal.",

    "text": "Been here a couple times and it's a must if you're hankering for a burger.   - Rising Sun: Kobe beef with a tempura avocado, genius. I ask for the teriyaki glaze on the side because it's too sweet for me and I also add a fried egg ($1). It's freaking awesome - just get it already.  - Gold Standard: the aged goat cheddar cheese was too overpowering for me. It's good just not as good as Rising Sun. - Korean Bullgogi: the kimchi was good. A little on the sweet side.   Bottom line - just get The Rising Sun. I prefer the steak fries out of the shoestring fries, onion rings and steak fries but they're all really good.   Shakes: don't make the mistake I did and get them to-go. You do not get as much as you would dining in and everyone knows the best part of a shake is that extra in the silver mixing cup.  - Cereal: my favorite so far and I like the captain crunch.  - Cow Float: pop rocks sounded cool. That's it - just a float.  - Drunken Monkey: like eating a candy bar  if that's what you want.   Overall, good burgers but at a price. If you were lucky and snagged a groupon, nice because after talking with the manager, it doesn't seem like they plan on doing it again.",

The beef was bland but overall the burger was decent.  - $17.5 for the burger. A bit on the expensive end but for the quality and portion it's not bad. (You're in Vegas what do you expect?!) Entrees range from $10-20 with the exception of the Billionaire burger. (Kobe beef w/ goie gras) - Great beer selection!  Service - I sat at the bar with my friend and the bartender was attentive. She was quick on the drinks!  Ambiance/Location - Located at Cosmos Hotel. (2nd floor) - Great place to grub after Marquee Dayclub. Casual and chill environment.  Recommendations - This place is known for their burgers, so order a burger when you dine at Holsteins! - Excellent beer selection.

It was fine since we stuck to ordering little tapas sized portions.    The good (not great): Truffle lobster mac n cheese-God, I'm such a sucker, but who can seriously screw this up.   Tom turkey mini burgers - good flavor, but better served as a whole burger to avoid the dry factor, as ours were.   The bad: Lobster \"corn dogs\" - again, we fell victim to fat kid food verbage and were duped into these $16 appetizers.  They were lobster tails (small ones at that, and maybe not even whole tails, but lobster meat) dipped in tempura batter and served as a pair.  Yup, those are a definite pass. Duck fat fries - eh.  Regular old fries to me.  The kettle chips were way better.   The ugly: Ok, nothing was really that bad. Just not that great. The menu is a little busy and there are definitely a few things they could get rid of.    On a high note, and what I would come back for, were Tenderloin Rossini mini burgers.  Oh, those were delicious, and cheaper than those damn lobster corn dogs.  Sheesh, go figure!",

I asked for them to lower the volume, and they refused. In fact, when I asked, I was told \"yeah, a lot of people ask us to, but we can't.\" He said they get a request to turn it down just about every day. I asked if anyone had ever said they liked it loud or commented that they appreciated the music, and he said \"no.\"   There's no dance floor. It's not set up for people to rock out or whatever. It's just a sit-down restaurant inside the mall area of the hotel/casino. Pretty fucking stupid to play music that loud when no one likes it.  It's not like they are trying to entice people to come in either because the speakers all face inward. Once you step out into the walkway just outside the entrance, the music gets a lot quieter. It was just really absurd listening to \"back dat ass up\" while trying to enjoy a meal and a conversation with my girlfriend. It made it impossible.   Noise aside, the food was pretty good. Some items were better than others. Burger was okay. Lobster Mac and Cheese was good. Cheesesteak rolls were okay. The milkshake was really good. I would give this place a 4 if it wasn't for the loudness inside.   Another note is that the artwork on the walls was depressing. Sad cartoons that could have been drawn by peta in an attempt to turn people into vegetarians. Almost as bad a choice as the music. I liked the art, but it was pretty much a bummer. The decor was otherwise pretty good.   Staff was nice enough as well. I'd eat their food again, but not in their restaurant.",

Which is pretty good, considering we were a large party with no reservation.  Buttermilk Onion Rings - big portion was easy to share, was crispy and came with a tasty dipping sauce Ahi Poke Tostadas - very small portion, and the ahi tuna tasted old and fishy, came with a nice avocado-like dipping sauce Caesar Salad - was fresh, flavorful and delicious Rising Sun Burger - requested this medium-well, but it was served medium. Was still really good, came with tasty teriyaki-type sauce, and tempura avocado! Fries - came out warm, soggy and sad Gold Standard Burger - requested this medium-rare, and it came out medium. Added a fried egg for another dollar, was good and had a lot of cheese Beef Sliders - three sliders that had very little cheese and a lot of bun. They would not let us add fried eggs to these because of size Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake - this was really good if you like coconut Brown Cow Float - root beer float with pop rocks! surprisingly good  The food here was OK to GOOD. Nicely decorated with modern cartoon type art. We were sat cramped into a circle table, and we could not scoot our chairs in because the chairs kept hitting each other. There were two large booths that  could seat 8-10, but they chose to seat 3 or 4 people in them instead of us. Considering the prices here, the service we received left a lot to be desired. The server took a long time to bring us water, and never checked on us after the burgers came out, and we ran out of water and drinks. Appetizers and salad also took a long time to come out.  I would not come here again. It was OK, but not awe-inspiring.",

Their appetizers are a little pricey, but that's expected at a Hotel / Strip property, especially the Cosmopolitan.  My friend and I opted to go with the Fried Pickles to start knowing the burgers included a heaping portion of meat.  They were a pleasant surprise as they were the full spears instead of the normal \"chip\" format.  The herb-caper mayo really complimented the cornflake-like crust.  The drink menu and beers on tap will satisfy any libation request.  My friend ordered the Steakhouse Burger and I opted for the Gold Standard (protein style aka. lettuce wrap).  The Steakhouse Burger was crusted w/ black pepper, creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, onions, mushrooms and swiss.  The Gold Standard had smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar, tomato confit, arugla and garlic aioli.  Overall, both were very tasty, however the kitchen misunderstood medium rare and sent my burger out well done.  I've eaten here over four times and each prior visit I haven't had any issues w/ cooking temperature.  The server was very nice and stopped by a few times during the meal to check in on us as well.  If you're in town looking for a good drink and bite to eat, I would recommend stopping in.",

I have to have my drinks non-alcoholic these days, so I opted for a plain jane chocolate shake. I was expecting pedestrian and boring-they didn't really have any fun choices for non-alcoholic shakes, but my choco shake was anything but! It was creamy and decadent with gooey chocolate sauce on the bottom. The depth of flavor was surprising!   Other friends had the frozen grasshopper, the campfire s'mores, and the vegan maple pecan shake. Everyone was very satisfied, and the table favorite seemed to be the campfire s'mores. Hands down.  Even though we had just eaten lunch at Jaleo, we did order some fries and fried pickles to go with the shakes. Both were delicious, and after having lukewarm, squirmy fries at Gordon Ramsey PUB, these fries were a welcome change of pace!  All in all, we had a great experience. We came looking for delicious shakes, and we were not disappointed. Next time, I will have to try a burger.",

    "text": "After an afternoon (and morning--and the night before) of drinking, my friends and I were craving some burgers and came across Holsteins. The restaurant has a nice trendy feel with the walls decorated with chic cow art. Our waitress was great and very attentive. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but she had recommended to me the Gold Standard.  I don't know if it was the alcohol, but this burger was one of the best I've ever had. All the flavors just meshed so well. The delicious dry aged beef sirloin was so savory and perfectly medium rare. The fries were fantastic as well. It's a bit expensive for your typical gourmet burger place, but then again, what can you expect from Vegas? If you're in the city craving burgers, definitely come check out Holsteins! I will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "I came here specifically for the Urth Burger with no intention to even glance at the milkshake section of the menu. But somehow my eyes were caught by the words \"Guava Float.\"  Damn, that sounds good. Skyy Citrus Vodka, house-made guava soda, coconut sorbet, pink bubble sugar, completely dairy-free! I just had to order it. Damn... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F1OTBxJ&s=8fcc891e6a73c4fd6c0e36c9b4ff1b81ee331f2911d9b33a5c79a5699b670fc3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/1OTBxJ</a>  Sipping on this fruity paradise made the atmosphere a little more tolerable. You see, I had flown into Vegas early that morning, spent most of the afternoon walking all around the strip and all I wanted was a quiet relaxing dinner. Little did I know that the Marquee nightclub was right next door and Holsteins tries to draw in that Saturday night crowd with a DJ playing loud booming music and having the waitresses wear short, tight, red dresses. But somehow, the Guava Float ($11) made all of that tolerable. I couldn't taste the booze but I was feeling that buzz :)  The Urth Burger ($13) was rockin! House-made vegan patty, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado. Yummmmmm!!! The skinny fries that it came with were also dangerously addictive. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F2KKpvM&s=1d35067b32130015b2c837ed421a4c0a2854b14402ac530bec90bad30eb42f3b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/2KKpvM</a>  The artwork in here, which I think is created by a local artist, is kickass! One of my favorites: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsu.pr%2F6tjK9n&s=2f38a121f416336d1f4ac80d8e76be0a13cbbe6cb543e55ae0c8a02ffb86f487\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">su.pr/6tjK9n</a>  As good as everything was, it was also extremely filling. Thank goodness for leftovers that save me money while in Vegas! And yes, next day Urth Burger with skinny fries are still good!  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Who would've thought that a vegan can not only survive but be amazed by a burger & milkshake restaurant! Viva Las Vegas :)",

    "text": "So, my bff and I decided to indulge after a weekend of partying in Vegas.   I'll start off by saying that I'm not a burger person. I KNOW STOP JUDGING MEEEEE. Despite that, I really enjoyed our meal here.   Service I can see how the wait here can be frustrating during peak hours, but my ninja skills paid off because instead of waiting we were able to snag one of the lounge tables instead. Although, it didn't really matter because the host ended up calling my cell phone within 15 minutes. Our server was very sweet and attentive.   Atmosphere I love the open feel of this restaurant! It's fun and inviting.   Food Remember all those times you worked out so you can look great in a bikini while strutting your stuff at EBC? Well, all of that goes right out of the window once you step foot into Holsteins!! Calories? What's that??  I'm pretty sure that I was teary eyed once I took a sip of their Red Velvet shake. I mean seriously alcohol mixed with red velvet cake?!? What else can you possibly need?? I seriously would rather sit at Holsteins sipping on their shakes instead of being in a cramped club.   Of course, because I obviously care about my arteries, I ordered the nom nom burger. It has potato chips and thousand island dressing inside.   8,000 calories later, Holstein's became one of the highlights of my last Vegas trip (I know I got problems lol). I can't wait to come back!",

Ok, so typically I don't order anything teriyaki or anything \"Asian inspired\" because it usually tastes sweet. This burger is on the sweet side, but I still ate it anyway. Fries were ok, value was ok, service was alright and the decor is cute with the walls of cute cow cartoons. I would say it's not really worth the wait if you had to wait.   I got a chance to try my friends' other burgers and they tasted better. So while the Rising Sun burger is popular, I think I like the taste of the Nom Nom Burger (can't believe I could actually feel the crunch of potato chips in that one without it being messy) or the Fun-ghi burger - who can say no to melted cheese, mushrooms and onions?",

    "text": "I thought I had already discovered my burger place in Vegas and that was Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and no one could take that place from my heart.  Holstein's though, came pretty close. But I think it was my zeal talking more than anything and my weakness for those little moments where a person can feel top of the heap just from buying a meal.   You see, I had hit it pretty big at roulette and craps the night before and was feeling confident. I knew going in that I wanted that Billionaire Burger, with its truffle aioli and foie gras, elements of a burger I know I would never eat anywhere else but on vacation. I did order it. And then some. That burger came medium rare, with additions of aged goat cheese and lobster, heightening an already indulgent, gluttonous, and decadent burger into a whole other realm. It was luscious.  But like I said, it wasn't fair. I made it luxurious because I willed it. Is the law of attraction in action? Perhaps. More than likely, though, it was me riding the high of a couple of wins and wanting to eat like a winner.  The philly cheese steak egg rolls were average. Nothing memorable or special.I also had a taste of the bamboozled shakes, the Tiramisu and the Fat Boy. Most gush about The Fat Boy but it was too candy-like for me. Boyfriend had the Memphis Burger, which had a layer of pulled pork that he believed might have been crisped up on the flattop beforehand to create a crust. I had a bite and was impressed but really, I only tasted it for the sake of tasting because I refused to part with, even lay down, my obscenely excessive truffle, lobster, foie burger, oh no.  You had better believe I am still thinking about that burger. Late at night, when all the lights are out, I reminisce about the taste of that False luxury.",

    "text": "I LOVE the burgers here! Coming from all the amazing burger joints in LA, I would say Holstein's has my second favorite burgers ever. It beats Umami Burger for sure, is on par with Bachi Burger, but Father's Office still wins. Nothing could beat Father's Office.  Anyway, Holstein's is fabulous in it's own respect. The restaurant is casual and comfy; decorated with cute little cows. Prices are on the more expensive side at ~$15-20 per burger with a side of fries but it is located in Cosmopolitan so I think it's pretty fair for Vegas prices. Service is only mediocre to me since the waiters check in too slow at times so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  I've tried the Gold Standard and the Rising Sun burgers.  Whenever I have these, oh man I am in burger heaven. Gold Standard has bacon, aioli, arugula, and aged goat cheddar cheese on top of a sirloin burger. The Rising Sun has a teriyaki glaze with Kobe beef and tempura avocado!! The avocado seriously is amazinggg. I definitely recommend these two burgers.   Not only are the burgers the bomb but the alcoholic milkshakes are too!  You can also ask them to be non-alcoholic if you really want that. They have a variety of flavors that they rotate around. You really can't go wrong with any of them. I've had the Frozen Grasshopper, Banana Creme Pie, and Red Velvet before and they were all yummy.    Overall a fun restaurant with delicious burgers and milkshakes perfect for your Vegas gluttony!",

Our party of 6 was able to call in that morning and have our table ready in 15 mins! Bright and spacious restaurant that can fit a variety of groups.  They offer complimentary butter and vinegar popcorn, (pretty darn good) while you look through their menu. Holstein's is popular for their alcoholic milkshakes, so naturally, we spent longer picking a milkshake than a burger.  My bf and I each ordered their most popular burgers along with the Campfire Smores milkshake to share.  The Rising Sun ($18) -- Kobe beef covered in a teriyaki glaze with tempura avocado. I enjoyed the first few bites but was over the glaze, I don't usually prefer sweet sauces. Fairly large sized burger that will certainly make you feel guilty.  Gold Standard ($18.50) -- This dry aged beef sirloin burger is similar to others you will find, with bacon, arugula, and garlic-chive aoili. We both enjoyed this more and agreed you can't go wrong with it. Their natural cut fries are also better than the sweet potato fries, which are nothing special.  Campfire Smores Milkshake ($13) -- They have a great selection of milkshakes and it was really hard to choose! The waiter recommended this and you can't really go wrong with graham cracker crumbles. Very tasty and sweet but you couldn't taste any of the Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka. Presentation was also nice with the toasted marshmallow.  Out of the two burger joints we tried this weekend, we prefer BurGR more. This was the most I have ever paid for a burger and have had better. If I come back, it would have to be for a milkshake, I don't think I can throw down $15+ for another burger.",

    "text": "At the recommendation of a friend, we went to Holsteins and I really loved the place.  The atmosphere is just right with a cool, casual vibe.  I am in love with the little pig cow!  But that's just a bonus to the menu that takes burgers & shakes to another level with gourmet touches.  I wanted to try everything on the menu and am jealous that there isn't a Holsteins in NYC so I can.  Korean Hot Dogs, The Rising Sun, and Billionaire Burger were all calling my name.  I settled on The Fun-ghi beef burger with Gruyere, truffle oil, and portabello.  It was delicious and I could taste all the flavors. The patty is not oversized and very juicy.  I ordered medium temperature, but it came out more medium well however I didn't mind because it was still juicy.  Had the shoestring fries which were nice & crispy.  We also had the Ahi Poke appetizer which came out at the same time as our burger.  It was fresh but the flavors were hard to taste but I think it's because the flavors of the burger overpowered while having both dishes at the same time.  Of course, I had to have a shake but opted for a virgin strawberry shake because I didn't want to be tipsy for a wedding later that day.  But I SO wanted to try a bam-boozled shake like the Almond Joy.  Even the complimentary popcorn was good and I'd buy bags of the stuff.  We had salt & vinegar popcorn, which is one of my favorite flavors.    Please, please open a location in NYC!!",

    "text": "I've been here around three times and its so good! The first time I got a their mini burger sliders (good), the second time the mini hot-dogs (so cute and yummy!) and the most recent time I ordered the lobster mac and cheese (amazing!) I went after Zarkana and had their late night menu. I think a restaurant that has a late night menu is awesome. Many restaurants close around 10-10:30 and I love when something is open later so I can eat a second quality dinner aka not fast food when I get hungry.   I decided on the mac and cheese because 1. I love love love cheese and pasta and 2. Their lobster is flown in fresh in everyday which is appealing. The macaroni was so cheesy and I devoured it in 5 minutes. It also came with a chip that had some kind of lobster dip on it. Yum yum! The only thing that would have been better would be a larger portion; I thought it was a tad small.   I also ordered the upside down cake martini. It was the best martini I ever had and finished it in five minutes. It was more of a dessert martini so if you're not a fan of that then I wouldn't get it. If they were cheaper I would have ordered a second. I would recommend this drink to anyone who loves girly drinks! I also recommend their adult milkshakes. Its a milkshake with liquor mixed in. The first time I tried one was their cereal one. I loved it because it was unique that you couldn't find it anywhere else which is a selling point for me. If you want a good meal-even if its late night- I recommend this place!",

    "text": "Oh, Holsteins.   Let's see, where do I start? The popcorn. It came out first. It was surprisingly spicy! I love me some spice, but it was kind of an odd flavor. I won't hold this against Holsteins since it was a free appetizer.   The bamboozled milkshakes. These bad boys are 5-star all the way. Creamy, huge, delicious. Really interesting flavors along with the classics. You could just barely taste the booze- it was perfect. I could taste it, so I knew it was in there, but it didn't ruin or impact the overall flavor. So, so good.   The burgers didn't live up to the hype. They were really good, but I expected a life-changing burger, and this just didn't deliver. For the price and the hype I was disappointed.   I'd return in a heartbeat, but I'd just grab a shake and go.",

Our Server however was excellent. He was friendly and knew the menu well. I decided to go with the Kobe burger. It had chips on it which added a interesting flavor to the burger. I also went with one of the loaded shakes. The shake was great and by far my favorite part of the meal. The burger was good however a bit on the dry side. It was a good size just not on par with The Burger bar or Ramsey burger. One nice thing here though is the fries were included with the burger unlike Ramsey burger (they are included at the burger bar also). As one of the more popular places to eat at the Cosmopolitan Holsteins could use a bigger dinning room. Over all the burger here is good but I like the Burger bar and Ramsey's if you are looking for a gourmet burger. Don't miss out on the loaded milkshakes though!!!",

We stopped in on St. Patricks day and everyone was clearly in the spirit of the holiday. They had holiday specials with a corned beef burger and leprechaun milkshake. Definitely a nice little touch to the holiday.  Our waitress came by right away and was more than accomodating. She was thorough, poised and really sweet. Definitely earned herself a good tip. (+1)  The food was all she said it would be. My guest had their regular American chesseburger (because he's boring), but he said it was one of the better burgers in LV. Not to mention, he ate everything on his plate. My cobb salad was really delicious. Salad at burger places isn't usually to die for, but this was a step above the rest.  (+1)  We ended our meal with a chocolate milkshake and damn, was it good. It wasn't chocolate ice cream and milk but more like chocolate ice cream with real actual melted chocolate mixed in  (+1) and then loads of fresh whipped cream on top (+1)  I'd definitely come back for a quick bite.",

Not only did the menu look appealing but they had seemingly found a way to combine two things I love most: sweets and alcohol. Sounded like a winner.   I'm a huge fan of goat cheese and avocado so I immediately gravitated to the Gold Standard burger and my dining companion chose the Rising Sun. Of course, we ended up trying each other's and, I have to say, I was definitely not disappointed with what was hitting my tastebuds. Both burgers were cooked to perfection and much different than any I have ever eaten; Major points for that.   As I said before, two words: alcoholic milkshakes. I didn't get the chance to try one my first time around but the second time, I brought some friends from out of town who I thought would really enjoy it, and we ordered the Grasshopper and the Smores. Both were incredible! Sweet, tasty, smooth. They were so delicious, I didn't even mind the price.  Holsteins is a treat for everyone, no matter what their eating habits. Conservative, experimental, vegan; they do it all! I will definitely be returning soon!",

    "text": "Love the cosmopolitan and have been to Holsteins a couple of times.  It has a fun and casual decor (hot pink cow in front) matched with a really nice looking bar.    Sat at the bar both times.  The bartenders were friendly and suggestive without being too intrusive.  They have a great beer selection and will help recommend one if you want to try something new.  Although I usually like ordering specialty cocktails at places like this, I noticed that they had bubble-gum vodka (one of my favorites) so the bartender made me a  bubble-gum martini that was delicious! It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for.   For food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm!   Also ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own).   Holsteins is a cool hang-out spot.  Not just an ordinary burger joint, they have really creative things on the menu that you wouldn't expect. Will definitely come back, there are still so many things I want to try!",

Perfect for a full meal or just drunk munchies (the buffalo wings, little hot dogs, and shoestring fries did not disappoint).  Also, it's very reasonably priced, so that's a huge plus.  As for the service I can't really speak for the tables, but the bar staff was AMAZING.  I definitely recommend wedging your way into Marcell's section of the bar.  Although I loved all the bartenders, he was by far the coolest and made awesome drinks!    Between the food, staff, and fun crowd hanging at the bar, it made for an overall great experience.  I will absolutely return on my next trip to Vegas!  P.S. If you order the happy meal, you get a cowbell to take home and harass all your friends and family with.  I totally recommend that too!!",

I also has a amazing Milkshake, it was some minty something of another but it was so large, and the amount left in the mixer was almost half of what was in my glass i dare not finish it all lol it was so good, pricey in comparison to burgers back home but soooooo well worth it! I got my burger cooked Medium (we can only cook out medwell in the great ONTARIO) and it actually made such a difference! so delish!

But it came with a smear of guacamole that was absorbed into the bottom and top of the bun bun like butter would be; caramelized onions that were mon existent and more like translucent relish and sprouts that were mushed and all cooked into the gross concoction. Just the thought of it makes me sick because the super dry,  salty, grainy( like knuckle pieces)of a thick turkey patty kept me up all night burping it up. Even into the next day did I taste the awful burger. I was super duper sick. Sweating nauseous x10 and just wanted to die kinda sick. Do NOT order the turkey burger. Unfortunately we had gross food. This is bound to happen at a lot of places ; but it literally made me sick. I have used yelp for years but never gave my two cents.

To be honest, if you don't have to sit down, I would recommend Secret Pizza over this place. But the burgers are good.",

    "text": "I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their \"Gold Standard\" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point.   In general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah.   Overall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.",

The service was slow and apparently the shake making was slower. They have a wide array of shakes with alcohol--I chose the Black Cow Float (3 Olives Cherry Vodka, Coca-Cola, Vanilla Ice Cream, Chocolate Pop Rocks)...while the ingredients sound tasty it was nothing spectacular. I would have opted for one of their original shakes sin alcohol.  The fast cooking burgers were something else! I highly recommend the Gold Standard...there is a reason why they call it that. If you like bacon, cheddar cheese and arugula it's the perfect burger for you.  Oh and did I mention the seasoned popcorn they serve before every meal? Tasty and unique! Good enough to come back...but next time it's the original shake before the bun and hopefully faster service.",

We had the pork belly buns as an appetizer. Recently had the peking duck buns at Bachi Burger and although these were okay, they didn't even compare to the Bachi ones.  I also had a comparable kalbi burger.  Again, the winner goes to Bachi Burger.   In trying to create a asian-fusion burger, leave it to the asians...it was good, but lacking certain flavors, spices.  It's the difference between Chinatown cuisine and PF Changs.  Both can be good, but you can't beat authentic chinese.    My wife had the Greek style lamb burger.  Now, we had this when they had the slider version a few months back and it was incredible.  I remember being blown away by it.  This full sized burger was dry, not juicy at all.  It had some nice seasoning, but I wasn't too impressed.    All in all, pretty pricey and not even close to what I remember...I'll choose Bradley Ogden for my high end burger any day; and Bachi Burger for my fusion burger.  If you want a great meal in the Cosmo, I suggest Milos or Secret Pizza!",

    "text": "The fellas and I were looking for a quick dinner option before hitting the club this particular night. Luckily, after walking to the exit and realizing it was pouring outside, we turned around and noticed Holsteins across the hall from the Marquee.   First and foremost, the service was friendly and the staff did a great job. Secondly, the food was well worth it.   To start, they bring out seasoned popcorn that was quickly devoured by us. Next I ordered the Frozen Grasshopper (a Bam-Boozled Shake) that consisted of Peppermint, Chocolate, Creme De Menthe, Van Gogh Chocolate Vodka. While it was good, it was definitely a lot (couldn't finish it after the burger).   And lastly, their burger. My, what a burger! After being torn between the Gold Standard & Fun-Ghi Big Buns, I decided to go with the Gold Standard. Now this burger is as follows: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli. I ordered mine medium and it was plated as such. The sirloin was cooked to perfection with a beautiful char outside and juicy inside. The smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar gave it a great kick, but for me, the magic came in the garlic-chive aioli. I mean, WOW, what a burger!   Every bite was tasteful, satisfying, and worth every penny. It was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. All the ingredients played beautifully with one another, and came together to form a great experience.   Will remain a favorite in Vegas and one I MUST revisit whenever I'm in town. So should you.",

We had a very short wait to get in, which was fine....but when we did get in there we tons of tables open so that was a bit weird. Didn't really bother me though.   We ordered the fried pickles to start and I then got the Fun-ghi. This is a burger I would typically get. My husband guessed that's what I'd order. It just missed the mark for me. It was a little too well done and lacked flavor.  My husband got the El Machete and really liked it.   I had checked in on four square which gave me a free beer, so I ordered that with my waiter. He ended up forgetting about it, which I really didn't care about it and wasn't going to say anything. When he came back to ask if we wanted dessert he realized he had forgotten it. I said it was fine and didnt need it but he went and got it for me in a to go cup which was really nice of him.   I wrote another review for Burgr that we went to the next night. I preferred Burgr over Holsteins, but I might give them another chance if I'm out here again.   Service was very nice and friendly.",

We decided to drop by here for a quick lunch before Marquee Dayclub, since it's right outside Marquee's main entrance on the 2nd level. For some reason or another, we decided to sit in the bar and lounge area, instead of the dining area. The lounge had a few couches and chairs and we found a spot that fit seven of us. The rest of our group decided to sit at the bar.  Not all of us ate, and I honestly don't even remember if I had a burger or not. If I did, it was obviously pretty unmemorable. I do remember getting fries and those were pretty standard. I also remember the service being on the poor side, but it wasn't a big deal. At that time, if you checked in on Foursquare, you could get a free pint of beer. Our server said all 10 of us had to check in and show him the check-in for us to get it. Not all of us had Foursquare or cell service, so that was kind of irritating and inefficient. I mean, technically he didn't do anything wrong, but you know there are always those servers who are more lax and will get you the freebie without actually seeing the check-in. This guy was not one of those servers.  Every time I pass by Holsteins since then, I get bad vibes so I doubt I'd ever come back, unless it's for convenience. If I'm going to Dayclub, I'd rather get bottle service and food from Marquee, which is surprisingly tasty, than eat at Holsteins again.",

The tempura avocado, the teriyaki glaze, the yam crunchy bits, the spicy mayo all combine to make a flavor delight in my mouth. The had bites of the Nom Nom and Gold Standard too. Both were quite good but not quite as amazing. The onion rings were crispy and the boozy shakes were to die for. The Coffee and Doughnuts was oh so amazing! The Caramel Cheesecake was also delicious. This was one of my top meals in Vegas. No one should even consider the other Big Name burger joints. This place blew them away.",

    "text": "Perfect example of customer service overcoming inconvenience; this was a great example of how a smile and forming a comfortable relationship with clientele can save a marginal experience.   This was a later night during this trip, and as such, it was after ten P.M. when we rolled in here for an impromptu meal. Because it was late, they had turned the music up significantly and had a DJ spinning the beats, and let's say it was loud. Not that you're walking in not knowing that but by this time our choices were limited. After only a few moments, our waiter Sam greeted us, and we explained the music level was loud enough we were not even sure we'd be staying. Sam offered an inviting and also understanding smile and offered to check in with us again in a few more minutes. I have to admit, the humor, the charm, and charisma helped; plus another look at the menu.   We found ourselves able to ignore the volumes and all of us found items suitable to our tastes for dining. Nice menu selection, keeping in mind it is of course a burger and shake kind of place, but at the same time  it didn't overwhelm the senses. Several appetizers, smaller and larger variations of the shakes, desserts, and burgers for everyone. I went with the El Caliente; once served hardly a word was spoken. Good quality meat, nicely balanced seasoning, delicious bun. The sweet potato fries were underwhelming, not bad just okay. I enjoyed the presentation, it was appropriately fun for the style of place.   I wish I'd had room for a desert but that wasn't happening. Again with our waiter, what a difference a warm, humorous person with an understanding smile makes. Sam made good conversation, was funny, and made what seemed like it would be a marginal or questionable experience very pleasant.",

    "text": "Las Vegas Burger Mission Part 3 took place just a couple weeks ago, and my travel companion and I decided on Holstein's. It did not disappoint one bit.  Right out of the gate, things were looking good....we found the place in the Cosmopolitan hotel easily, we were seated without a wait (it was a late Tuesday afternoon), and our waiter looked like Jared Leto. I like Jared Leto. Sweet.   I decided to go with a Black and White Shake (like Jerry Seinfeld's black and white cookie, but in milkshake form, and it didn't make me puke) and the Rising Sun Burger. If I ever go back to Holstein's, I might have to get the same thing...I loved both. I particularly got into the tempura avocado on the burger. My pal got the Steakhouse Burger and the Birthday Cake shake, which had cake flavored vodka in it. Let me just say this....the person who invented cake flavored vodka deserves some sort of a Nobel Prize, and my friend who decided her life's problems could be washed away with a combination of ice cream and booze deserves some sort of a prize as well....because that's just awesome. And surely explains in part why we have been pals since 1975. Anyway, she enjoyed her burger and shake as much as I enjoyed mine.   Burgers come with fries....nice that you don't have to order them (and pay for them) separately. We were both disappointed in the fries at BurGR, so the fry test here was paramount....alas, great fries. Big Sigh Of Relief.   To top it off, Jared Leto was the perfect server and took good care of us. Oh hell, give him a prize, too...maybe an Oscar.  If you're looking to try one of the many burger places on The Strip, be sure to consider Holstein's. And say hi to Jared for me.",

The twist being goat cheese, arugula and a tomato confit.  These additions take my favorite burger to a different level.   The placed offered us a choice between table side and more informal \"lounge\" seating. Lounge seating is couch and chairs you pull up yourself. We had a table of 6 and This was definitely the quicker option. We had a genuinely a good time. A bit more difficult to eat at but unless you're using a knife and fork, it's pretty great spot to have a large group.    Kenya was our server and she was very good to us. Especially dealing with the many changes we had in our initial drink order.   A fully stocked bar. We had a round of Vegas bombs (new to all of us) and several beers and jager bombs.    The burgers were amazing. Such a great combo. Everyone was happy with their choices. Mine was a complete burger. The goat cheese and bacon played really well with the burger. I was pleasantly surprised. Burger came with fries. Pretty standard fries, I think double fried.  We had a good time, staff was very helpful. I'll definitely put this burger in my top 5 in Vegas.",

Smokey, peppery, hearty, juicy burger. The shakes are very creamy too! Just pace yourself or you could end up with a 5,000-calorie lunch ;)",

    "text": "It's almost hard to believe that Holstein's is run by the same people responsible for LBS at the Red Rock. I guess if I had to make an analogy, this place is like Michael Jackson (in terms of talent, not behavior or affinity for boys) whereas LBS is LaToya (or maybe even Janet) and the LBS Patty Wagon is Tito.  What that means, is this place rocks. The menu is more diverse and creative than it's sibling establishments with it's spiked milkshakes, apps, burgers, alternative dishes for non-burger folks, and an extensive beer list.  The Rising Sun ($16.50) is an amazing burger made out of a sizable kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake (yeah, I had to look up furikake to know what it was... I'm not ashamed to admit it), crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. The ingredients gave it a rich, sweet, unique flavor and the crispy yam bits a crunchy texture. If I have any complaint about this burger it's the height of it. The thick patty and huge slices of avocado make it difficult to get the whole thing in your mouth (didn't Macauley Culkin say the same thing to MJ?).  My wife got the Gold Standard ($17.50) - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. She loved it and only let me have one bite. If you want a more traditional burger, go for this. But, I still thought the Rising Sun was better.  Each burger came with an order of fries. So She got the regular fries and I got he steak cut fries. Both were very good -- crispy exterior, light and soft interior.  Our son got the kid's chicken fingers and fries. That's always a winner with him. It came with 3 big tenders and some carrots and celery.  Even after those big burgers we still had room for dessert. Our choice... lollipops. The chocolate brownie and strawberry were excellent. The lemon meringue and red velvet cake were largely forgettable and uninspired and the blondie was bland and didn't come close to reminding me of a blondie brownie.  Despite the lackluster dessert, the burgers were so good I can overlook that misstep. We didn't have any issues with the service, especially the kitchen, which sent out the food surprisingly fast. I'm not sure if I'd say this is my favorite burger place, but it's definitely one of the top and one that shouldn't be missed.",

I'm pretty easily impressed when it comes to gourmet burgers though.   My husband got the burger with the chips in it.. nom nom. It was a little plain and not so nom nom. He wanted mine.  The sweet potato fries are way worth the $1 upgrade. They were perfection on my tongue. Nice and crispy and chewy.  We also split the autumn house salad... it was SO good. Lots of fresh greens and fruit tossed with a sweet but tart apple vinaigrette.  We split the tiramisu adult shake and it was delicious with little chocolate and espresso bean shavings. Wanted to try others but we were way too full.  Great draft beer selection too.  But the 5 stars really goes to the outstanding waitstaff. My husband was in a wheelchair and barely up on crutches during our visit. He needed to use the restroom and when he asked where it was, our waitress was like \"wait, there's a line right now\" and actually offered to keep checking to see if the line cleared and let us know. I can't remember her name but she was a sweetheart!",

We split a donut shake, infused with Kahlua, and it was good....though a little on the weak alcohol content.  The shake brought back childhood memories of the old shake shops where you get not only a large glass shake, but half a metal shake container full of extra as well! More than enough to share.  I ordered the steakhouse burger that came with fries.  It was topped with mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  The burger itself was kind of devoid of taste...but did have a spicy kick of peppercorns.  My wife ordered the sliders and topped it with blue cheese, caramelized onions....and those three little burgers were the prize.  Very tasty.  Service was good, seating was fine...but overall, (and especially for the price)...Meh!",

Minus 1 star bc the booth height is oddly 3-6\" too low for the dining table (and I'm average height), which made for an awkward ergonomic experience; and the bleu cheese dressing was runny, so didn't scream high quality.  Otherwise, the food was tasty and fresh.  I'd go back.",

John Curtas claimed that Holsteins pork belly buns were almost as good as Momofuku's in NYC (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatinglv.com%2F2010%2F12%2Fholsteins-has-got-it-goin-on%2F&s=af3c5b8176aa1f4608126ab2abd14a62c5d2cc494bfc826381bbad642f57372b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinglv.com/2010/12/hol...</a>) so we had to try them out.  A lemon meringue shake and a Korean burger rounded out the order.  My husband and I were starving from driving around Mandalay Bay and Luxor for an hour trying to find parking and getting stuck in traffic.   Our very nice server quickly took our order.  The food came out very, very fast.  Which was great but also a little disconcerting.  They can cook that fast?  LBS, Holsteins sister restaurant at Red Rock Casino, takes forever!  And we weren't the only ones.  Our neighbors all got their food within 5 minutes of ordering.  Crazy.  The pork buns are NOT \"almost as good\" as Momofuku's.  Not even close.  Maybe because Holsteins can see John Curtas coming a mile a way in his all-white suit, he got a better version.  But these were just ok.  The Korean burger had a good flavor to it but there was too much liquid involved and the bottom bun was pretty soggy.  The lemon meringue shake stole the show.  It's sounds weird but salted caramel in a lemon shake with Grand Marnier - brilliant!  We figured our modest order and half-starved state would leave us enough room to try the infamous China Poblano next door. We were wrong.  The fat content of the food combined with the shake made us full very quickly.   I like the service and the concept and the shakes.  I am definitely a fan.",

So I have no problem at all to pay more for great food & great service. But having said that: $16.50 for a burger?? Really? Then I added one slice for Pepperjack and that was another $2!! So $18.50 for a burger with fries. That is crazy. While the burger was decent, the service was okay, and the noise level in that place was unbearable.

It was my first time in the casino and although the place was packed, the bartender was courteous and let me know she would be right with me.  After I ordered a Corona (22oz!!) I found a chair and order the Rising Sun burger.  I love this place. Kobe beef, house glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado!!! I'm done...  Good food and big drinks, perfect for a quick stop in Las Vegas, they've re-made the burger joint another favorite destination for my vacations here.",

    "text": "02/16/11 DINNER:   Without planning in advance we ended up here. Didn't have a burger! Instead, had drinks, \"appetizers\" (turned out to be plates bigger than appetizers) and desserts. The classic martini was terrific, I got the GIN variety (does no one drink gin in this town?), containing a gin of which I had never heard (\"Nolet Silver\"?) which was floral and smooth, garnished with pickled shallot. (Expecting shallot bulbs on a stick, instead it was shaved in the bottom of the glass!) Another had a\"bloody mary\", which came \"up\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it! Food was \"fried pickles\" (fried dill spears, fried olives, caper berries, prosciutto, salami w/ herb-caper mayo), \"street tacos\" (crispy shells filled w/ shreds of duck confit, foie gras, trufle crema & cranberry relish), \"truffle lobster mac n cheese\" (maine lobster, black truffle & mac in a tallegio-marscapone sauce), and \"Bull's Balls\" (2 risotto rice balls stuffed with veal, topped with \"tomato fondue\" and a slice of lardo). A very rich, decadent collection of dishes, I thought all were very well done, especially the mac (WOW!). The \"Bulls' Balls\" weren't as good as I had hoped, mostly rice with very little filling, and the lardo kinda lost amongst the strength of the \"tomato foudue\", which was genius. (An angel-hair pasta with that fondue would be crazy good.) The \"street tacos\" were really good but really rich. My fave thing on the \"fried pickles\" were the fried olives (only 2, we had to fight over those!). Ended with a \"stout float\" (Guinness, ice cream, oatmeal crumble), very good. After food we had a really wacky concoction: \"Johnny Apple Seed\", consisting of Knob Creek, honey and apple cider. First of all, the very nice server said it was the first time that it had been ordered since it was added to the menu (!) and second, they had no idea what \"hard cider\" was! We had to explain, there are alcoholic apple ciders out there, was this one of those?, but the answer never came. No matter, it was a nose and throat clearer! AHEM! But a great idea, IMHO. Sipping it took about 15 minutes, and well worth it! So overall, I'd say GO. Now I need to go back for a burger, perhaps that \"duck duck goose\", stuffed with duck confit, duck cracklings & foie gras! YIKES!",

Upon arrival we were seated in the dining area away from the bar...a seat near the tv was requested and was received since the place wasnt that busy. Ordered the rising sun burger which is a house favorite...and upon my first bite i figured out why- its f' delicious! Got it medium well with shoe string fries and couldnt be happier...argueable the best burger ive ever had. My brother ordered the california burger  with steak fries also medium well - he enjoyed the perfect amount of spice and the avocado was a great addition to all the flavor. When we checked in via foursquare we discovered a coupon for a complimentary house lager with any entree and after a quick chat with the manager on duty I was drinking free beer! My brother ordered a cup of coffee which the waitress did not add to the bill and thus we tipped handsomely ontop of the already attentive service. Overall a great burger place, a bit pricey but worth it in our opinion. The decorations and atmosphere of the place is really unique too!",

    "text": "Holstein's Shakes and Buns   February 2, 2016   Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing today to complain about the inexcusable treatment I received on Tuesday, January 19th at your Las Vegas location.   I entered the restaurant at about 8:30pm as I was meeting with friends who had already been seated and ordered for me. When I arrived, I knew where my table was and I walked past the hostess who at no time stopped me, and a busser clearing a table, asked if my dog was a Service animal, to which I said yes and at not being questioned further made it to my table and sat.   As my meal was already waiting for me, I began to dine and I had not yet taken my second bite when the manager came over and asked me if I had Identification for my animal?   As per ADA Law: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ada.gov%2Fservice_animals_2010.htm&s=bb7f0d52684fb51deb0ae49fab20aa5565c8992ad3f1ab6123df81e5ccc7a5c3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ada.gov/service_animals_...</a> * When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. o Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. o Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.     I was then asked to provide any form of ID to show he was a service dog. I obliged the manager and provided his certification although I had already stated I did not need to. Upon him seeing it, he said he needed an ASPCA card and some other form of ID. I explained that neither of them are covered by ADA and he then stated that His establishment (Holstein's) didn't recognize dogs for \"Stress Disorders.\"   At this point, I had become highly agitated, not to mention embarrassed by the continuing debate and had some choice words with him about sacrifice and losing friends. He had to step away for a moment and I took that moment to apologize to a couple at the table next to us and they felt I was in the right. Their daughter has a service animal as well and knew the rigors I was going through.     The manager then returned with an email he was basing his reasons for having me leave the restaurant.  In trying to placate me he made mention that his father was in Vietnam and supports vets. Yet still I was being kicked out and had not in fact, broken any laws. * A person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: o (1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or    o (2) The dog is not housebroken. When there is a legitimate reason to ask that a service animal be removed, staff must offer the person with the disability the opportunity to obtain goods or services without the animal's presence. * Establishments that sell or prepare food must allow service animals in public areas even if state or local health codes prohibit animals on the premises.   I left your establishment quite appalled and publically embarrassed, as were my friends. I apologized to the manager for yelling at him after my dog calmed me down and kept me from becoming too excited.   I trust this is not the way that Holstein's Shakes & Buns, wishes to conduct business with valued customers.  As a veteran, I have never encountered such treatment before.   I ask that you understand that service dogs are a protected entity and that your manager needs to recognize that as such. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss matters further and to learn of how you propose to prevent a similar situation from recurring. I look forward to hearing from you.       Sincerely,   Adam Chavez",

    "text": "I came here for snack before going to Marquee.  Holsteins offers gourmet burgers, @ very high prices.  They also offer salmon and chicken options, as well as apps like wings & calamari.  In addition, you can also get foie gras on your burger for $12 extra.  Lastly, Holsteins offers bamboozled shakes w/ liquor at $11.  I ordered the Gold Standard ($18 - Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli).  Sweet potato fries or rings are a $2 upgrade.    Unfortunately, the burger should have been called the \"Old Standard\", because it was a basic burger w/ bacon on top.  The burger wasn't that big, didn't have any distinctive flavor, and it was nothing special especially for the price.  I can get an equivalent burger & fries for much less.  The same goes for the fries.  They were nothing special:  Both 3 Stars.  The ambiance was typical sports bar w/ a bar obviously, lounge seating, and the regular dining room:  3 Stars.  The only thing that was superior was the service from Toshi the bartender.  He was super cool & friendly.  He also comped me on a drink, so I gave him the cost of the drink as an additional tip ($10):  5 Stars for Toshi.  Holsteins is a pricey place to have a burger if you are staying at the Cosmo.  But I would definitely not go out of my way to come here.  However, I would go out of my way to say hello to Toshi, and just have drinks.",

Called a-chocolypse now, all kinds of chocolate flavors with vodka, Rich creamy shake. And oh by the way two brownies and a full on chocolate bar loaded on top.

I went here with a group of friends and the wait wasn't terrible when we called ahead to reserve a table. We managed to get seated in about 20 minutes after calling.   They have popcorn on the table! That was something new for me. I liked the their popcorn too, it was buttery but it had a slight acidic taste to it.. maybe vinegar? either way it was great to munch on as we were looking over the menu :) I decided to get the rising sun and the gold standard burger and an oreo milkshake to share with my boyfriend, The rising sun and the gold standard burger were the two most popular burgers to get but I could understand why! They were delicious but I really enjoyed the gold standard. It won the award for best burger in Las Vegas and I agree! After trying Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, I thought Holsteins was more enjoyable. Their burgers had more flavor and their ingredients really complimented each other. I thought their shake was good but it wasn't anything special. I think I prefer the shakes at Burgr.  Overall I thought the food was great! I would definitely come back again :)",

    "text": "Burgers, fries, and shakes, the perfect hangover trifecta! My friends and I came for brunch even though we weren't hungover, since we were looking for a good burger. It was packed at the bar since there were a good amount of people here to watch the conference finals for football, and they were charging a $40 minimum or something crazy to watch from the \"lounge\" area behind the bar seats. We lucked out and got one of the last tables at the restaurant part with a TV, and had a good lunch and spot to watch the game. We tried:  -Complimentary Popcorn (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=6A9_UPW4c-N_pt7j2bMD9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Super addicting- they sprinkle a spicy-ish powder on top, and the popcorn is nice and crispy. A good way to start the meal, but it's also difficult to stop eating. -Captain Hook (Seared Salmon w/Remoulade Sauce, Smoked Salmon, Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Served w/Fries, $17, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eelZKpVyJlyG3YvjPoapeA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): I really liked this burger- the salmon was cooked perfectly, and it was a nice change from the other beef burgers we tried. Recommended! Their regular fries are just average- they needed to be fried more as well as more salt. -The Fun-Ghi (Beef Patty Topped w/Forest Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion, Gruyere Cheese, Frisee, Truffle Mayo, $17 + Onion Rings $2.50, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kmCDudtCE5AnL5skhFm_aQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Good flavor, but really salty. You have to like mushrooms and caramelized onions to like this burger, and the gruyere was quite overpowering. This wasn't a bad burger aside from the saltiness, but I liked the other two we ordered more. The onion rings were pretty disappointing since the breading was way too thick/heavy, so I wouldn't get those again.  -The Rising Sun (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado, $18 + Sweet Potato Fries $2.50, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KuT9_8CAr2V-s4iULriszQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum- this was our favorite burger since it was also the most unique. It was borderline too salty, but the crispy yam and avocado helped save it. Highly recommended! The sweet potato fries were also our favorite out of the fries/onion ring- they had the perfect amount of crispiness. -Virgin Frozen Grasshopper Milkshake (Peppermint, Chocolate, $9, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JXv6Xbd4MgSDGFqwgmtNNQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>): Yum, this was a good mint chocolate chip inspired milkshake. You'll be crunching on chocolate bits throughout though. -Bloody Mary ($13): Yuck, do not bother ordering this here, this was a waste of money. It needed more spices, and there was no celery stick!   Our server was new, and you could tell he was a bit nervous. However, he was really nice as was the other staff- they originally gave me regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, and were apologetic when I pointed it out and went to put in an order for the sweet potato fries right away. Our drinks took a while to come, but the wait wasn't too bad. Overall, we had some great burgers here and will definitely be back!",

Stopped in for lunch the moment they opened their doors at 11am. The service was good and the food is prepared at a fast pace. To kill a small amount of time before your food is ready, I recommend one of the alcohol milkshakes while you wait (if you're of age). The milkshakes are really good.  For the burger, I ordered the billionaire burger with foie gras and added lobster. Of course I would order the most expensive burger and make it even more expensive by adding lobster LOL. Regardless of the price, the burger was very flavorful and the foie gras made the burger juicier than it already was. The burgers are a nice size as well so prepare to be stuffed.  With many burger spots on the Vegas strip, I can say this one is worth a visit.  Lunch 2/13/2015",

I love cows and I also love to eat a good burger. The waiter recommended the Gold Standard Burger and I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was pretty good and it comes with bacon not the best I have had but definitely up there. It was juicy and the meat quality was fresh. The fries were just ok they are the thin style.  I love the seasoned popcorn they give you while you are waiting and it pairs perfectly with the free draft beer you get when you check in on Yelp. The burger and fries were about $20 a little on the pricey side but it's Vegas and when you consider Vegas it's a deal. Would definitely go back and try another burger- they have so many creative combinations to choose from.",

When they say \"crusted with black pepper\" they were not kidding. this \"black pepper\" was like crushed pepper corn covering every inch of the cheese slice. you must love black pepper to be able to enjoy this burger. it was quit yummy  **the fun-ghi- Beef Patty, Roasted Portabello, Carmelized Onion, Truffle Oil, Gruyere, Frisee, Aioli. nothing special to note about this burger. you could smell the fragrance of the truffle oil which i love, but the flavor wasn't strong. i love black pepper so i liked the steakhouse burger better and it seemed more juicy.  of note. they don't take reservations on the weekend. but the plus side is that when you put your name down they will text/call you when your table is ready and give you about 10 minutes to respond before they give it away.  i've been here two times and both times the food didn't live up to the hype. the burgers are quite expensive. coming out to around ~$23 per person with tax and tip for just the burger entree, nothing extra, no drinks etc. that is QUITE expensive for a burger and fries in my book. and this isn't anything fancy. to my knowledge (i could be wrong) its not grass fed organic meat or anything. i probably won't be back due to the cost but might stop by to try a milkshake.",

BTW, if your at the Cosmopolitan for a conference and want a quick bite before rushing back to your meeting.... Don't come here.

    "text": "I ate here on Saturday, August 20th. There were two concerts that night, plus the fact is was Saturday made it very crowded. The 20 minute wait wasn't a problem. The fact that the pager went off to tell us that they were ready to seat us when they weren't was the problem. We had to wait another 10 minutes.    Be warned that the music is VERY LOUD. You have to yell at everyone which gets old. I'm use to loud music in a club but not when I'm eating.  The redeeming qualities of the music are that the bass is low so you can't feel it in your chest and the mix is arranged nicely.  The milkshakes are really tasty. They range from $11-14. You get two drinks for that price since you also get a completely filled shake container. My boyfriend liked his Korean Bull Gogi burger. I got the chicken and waffle appetizer. It wasn't anything special about it. I like that they gave us a small bucket of popcorn while waiting for our food. It didn't seem to take too long for the food to come out but they gave us popcorn anyway.   A little annoyance for me that has nothing to do with the stars was the tie wearing. The waiters are suppose to wear ties, but they have to stick them in their shirts so they don't flop around. It looks weird, like they're wearing ascots. I think the restaurant should either give them shorter ties or supply tie clips.    I would go back here for the milkshakes, just the milkshakes.",

    "text": "Realllly good burgers here. Like, in the top 5 of of the best burgers I've ever had kind of good.  I had the Gold Standard dry-aged sirloin burger with cheddar goat cheese and bacon.  The texture was of a ridiculous melt in your mouth quality.  My husband had the Nom Nom burger with chips, which he also said was one of the best he's had (and he almost always orders a burger when out to eat). We split a chocolate malt, which was off the charts delicious and fresh-tasting. Seriously have never had a malt so good. I wish I'd had more room to try a different shake, but we walked out with leftovers so I wasn't up for dessert.   On the service side of things, we were given our choice of sitting in couches at low tables by the bar or a table. We chose a table and were seated immediately. Atmosphere is on the loud side, especially for a week-day, but it wasn't bothersome. They didn't have the beer i originally wanted, but the waiter immediately offered me another one from the same brewery, which was helpful.  Our waiter walked the balance between attentive and giving us enough space to enjoy our food.   We stayed at the Cosmopolitan, but this was the only restaurant we tried, aside from secret pizza and room service. I would probably choose to go back here over trying one of the other restaurants, simply because the food was so good and there were so many other items I wanted to try (shakes with booze, for starters!).",

I've tried half the burgers on the list, and they have all been great, although the million dollar burger was the least impressionable and totally not worth it. When in doubt, keep it simple and get the nom nom or get the flavorful rising sun with a side salad or the sweet potato fries. Also, try the lobster mac and cheese! It comes with lobster chunks and sprinkled with bread crumbs. You're tongue an stomach will be please, and even as a midnight snack or leftovers, it will still taste good!",

    "text": "This is the 3rd time I've been to Holstein's and I have to say it's one of my favorite places on the strip! ;)   The first two times I had a great experience, and so I will tell you about my 3rd.   My two friends and I got there about 2pm on Saturday and the place was pretty jumping. Almost every time we have come it's been jumping so expect a 10-15 minute wait to get seated. We left our name with the cute hostess and  they took our phone number. Instead of using those little beeper things, they just text someone's phone in the group when your table is ready. I love technology.   We waited in the Chandelier lounge and had a Fire-Breathing Dragon cocktail while we waited. It was a little pricey, but fun none the less.   We got seated, and boom-got the complimentary Salt & Vinegar popcorn to start off and some chilled waters as soon as we sat down.   After perusing the menu, which seems to get new items every few months, I chose the Portabello Mushroom burger and the Cereal Shake (made with 3 scoops vanilla ice cream,1 oz. vanilla vodka,  1/2 cup Cap'n Crunch cereal (dry),milk, as needed to get desired consistency,whipped cream (for garnish) and a shot of Whipped cream Vodka I think?) which tasted delicious! The shakes come in standard shake glass and make room for the extra they bring out in the silver shaker-bonus! My friends ordered the Billionaire burger ($28 -OUCH!) and the Tiramisu shake-and my other friend ordered the Gold Medallion burger I think it was?   If your on a budget, the burgers and shakes are just big enough meal to split between two people or a couple, in addition to the free Salt & Vinegar popcorn.  Shakes came our first, which are almost a meal in themselves. The last two times I ordered the campfire smores and Almondy Joy (Cause I love chocolate) but decided to try the Cereal shake because I love cap'n crunch. I have to say I like the Tiramisu over my Cereal Shake which was super sweet.   We ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese which is always good (wish they gave us a larger serving!) and we gobbled that dish down in no time between the 3 of us.   Burgers showed up shortly after without a beat. I also ordered a fried egg  on mine. My meat was moist, the portobello succulent, the avocado delish, and the fried egg cooked just enough not to run all over the place. This burger is way too big to eat without spilling everywhere so I cut it in half to make it easier. The fries here are not my favorite, but come with meal, the onion rings were pretty good though.  Though my burger was good, I tasted my friends billionaire burger and the aged-Kobe beef topped with Goose liver (which is why it was expensive) and I have to say her burger was better than mine. Don't know if I could justify the extra $12 for it. My other friend who is a big foodie, said his Medallion burger was one of the best burgers he's had in a restaurant, and he's a very picky foodie.   All in all another great experience,  I like the hustle and bustle of the place, and all the good looking people in Cosmopolitan is never a let down. Thought he place is not cheap if your looking for an inexpensive place to eat, it's a fun experience overall and great to get a slight buzz from from a shake!  *note* I went hope and napped after my amazing meal.   Hope this helps!  Cheers!  ~MikeB",

We looked around and noticed one cow with many more caricatures of pigs instead.  Why the name Holstein if there's a bunch more pigs everywhere?  We each ordered one of many burgers listed. Cooked perfectly to order.  The shakes looked good.  Some blended with alcohol.  My only con - wimpy and very lukewarm fries.  Like they've been sitting around awhile.  $34 p/p inc tax and tip.",

We didn't order the boozy milkshake (not really much of a drinker) but we really enjoyed out food.  The bf ordered the carbonara burger which had chicken, bacon, cheese...just really rich and good.  I had the fun-ghi burger with portobellos and a truffle glaze.  The taste of the burgers was wonderful - they were a good size and bursting with flavor.  I liked both the fries and onion rings here as well.  I would definitely come back here...sort of a tie between this place and Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay (which we also love).",

I want to thank the bartender for asking me if I wanted it with alcohol or not.  I ordered the Billionaire buger. It's a burger named after one of the owners (i'm assuming bill). it's priced accurately for a burger with foie gras and it comes with fries.   I can't accurately rate the burger because I ate it at the hotel and didn't have a chance to taste it as soon as it was made ( I wanted to share with my friends).

    "text": "This place did not live up to expectations.  We browsed yelp reviews and looked through the menu prior to getting here, and were really excited to try the selection, but most of us left disappointed.  Luckily, I think I got the best burger of the bunch (The Rising Sun Burger!).  The Rising Sun Burger is an Asian-inspired burger so I loved the sweet, salty flavors.  The fried avocado and addition of tempura added a wonderful element to it.  I also added an additional egg on mine.  However, I think the key to a GREAT burger is the meat patty, and this is where Holsteins fell short with ALL our burgers.  Mine \"supposedly\" had a kobe beef patty, but I would've never known the difference because in-n-out serves a better patty.  They asked us how we wanted our patties cooked, and all of us went with medium-rare, but they were all overcooked.  Our patties tasted dry and flavorless.  Our group shared two appetizers - the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese and the Wings.  Both were mediocre.  The mac 'n cheese was runny, there was barely any lobster in it, and the portion was tiny.  Not worth the high price tag.  The wings were your standard wings - I think Wingstop wings are just as good.  Although I didn't order one, my friends said the alcoholic shakes didn't even taste like there were any alcohol in them.  They might as well have ordered regular non-alcoholic shakes elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.  Cool concept, but execution fell short.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to come here after we thought Eggslut was closed. We got seated pretty fast and saw the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The waiter came around and was friendly. We all asked for waters. Twenty minutes later, we get three waters. He says, \"I'm sorry, I can't count. I'll bring out another right away.\" After fifteen minutes have past, we had to ask someone, who appeared to be the manager, for another water. He quickly brought out another water which we were thankful for. Anyways, it took us another ten minutes to order. Now once we did, we did not get our food until probably 30-40 minutes. Our waiter was seen talking to another server against the wall. We couldn't tell if he was flirting as it appeared but either way he never came by our table once. My friend's water spilled and everyone except our server were at our table helping us. It was so kind of this one man to dry off our table. I'm sure it happens often but again we were grateful for this man. Our waiter finally comes out with our food and says, \"I'll be back to fill those waters.\" He never comes back until we are absolutely finished we our food. The fries were great but the Kobe beef was so dry we completely finished our waters. We had to ask another server for our server to refill our waters. Seriously? Mind you, the restaurant was not busy at all. We were so irritated by our server. The only time he asked us if we needed anything was when we were absolutely done with our food. Our waiter later has the audacity to ask my friend, who's check was $6 if we wanted change back since he gave the waiter a $20. Seriously again? A $14 tip when you never came by our table, was flirting with your co worker, AND never was to be seen in a not so busy restaurant. He was so instant we give him a large tip. Of course, we were going to tip him. I'm assuming he thought since we aren't older looking, that we wouldn't tip. What we should've done was tip him before and ask to be taken care of. Lesson learned, always tip first. Thanks Carlo, you seriously was amazing.",

    "text": "So I was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans.   I was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint.   We made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one.   Soon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal.   Our burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint.   Another plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious!   A third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!  A fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene.   Let's work on that self-confidence, shall we?",

I have been here more than once and though I enjoy the food the service not so great. It was a pretty slow night and not a lot of people were in the restaurant but the service was just just sad.   PROS: Black & white milkshake was excellent! (It is a must try) ordered the Hen House burger (Beef w/fried egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & onion w/ mustard & ketchup).  -- I really enjoyed the taste and it was perfect.  CONS: fries - bland service - was slow & our waitress was not very friendly. the place was too loud - but then it was club night.   I dont know if I am willing to come back, but for the milkshake i probably would.",

We all ordered this to share and I got a chance of trying everything, and honestly, nothing disappointed.   The fried pickles exceeded my expectations by far. They were pickle spears battered and deep fried with an aioli dipping sauce.   The crispy pork belly bun was full of flavor and the meat was so tender.   The onion rings were fried just right and had the right texture and crunch without being overly oily.   The burgers were on another level. Though each burger had many different components, it all worked so well together. I cannot wait to come back and try other burgers.   This place is a must stop every time I am in Vegas now.",

    "text": "I've been dying to try this place since the Cosmopolitan opened and I really wanted to love it.  But it was just okay.  The prices were a little crazy.  I know it's the strip, but $11 for a dogfish head beer??  $11 for a drunken milkshake is one thing but the beer situation is crazy.  Speaking of drunken milkshakes, I tried the drunken monkey milkshake.  It's basically a huge milkshake with banana, reese's cups and Frangelico.  Was sooo good!  What was not so good is the massive gut ache I got shortly after eating it but that could be on me.  The fried pickles I ordered as an appetizer were pretty good and I have high standards being from the place which claims to have invented the frickled pickle.  The lobster roll I ordered, in addition to being kind of bland and all mayo, consisted of two teeny buns and were definitely not worth the $18 price tag.  For $55 before tip, I can think of many other places I would rather go.  I have seen reference to some popcorn in other reviews but I didn't see this while there.  Overall, very underwhelming, but I still may give it another try.",

    "text": "Delicious, great fun burger combinations. Extra rich and super sweet shakes and amply sized. Underwhelming sides.  Since it's Vegas, there's no point in stressing about the price, since everything is at least 50-100% marked up than what it should be.  The Rising Sun was truly an innovative combo: Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado. Be warned, the Crispy Yam is merely just grated fried yams. The tempura avocado is extremely excellent though. But I mean, how do you go wrong with deep-fried fat? (For further reading: Fried Butter)  The Thai Steak Salad was barely average: Grilled Steak, Tomato, Cucumber, Red Onion, Romaine Lettuce, Green Papaya, Mint, Cilantro, Roasted Peanuts, tossed in a Sweet-chili Vinaigrette. The steak strips were substantial, but completely dry and tough, and I usually expect a sweeter sauce with my \"Asian\" salads, but the Sweet-chili vinaigrette was more vinaigrette than sweet or chili.  The regular fries & the sweet potato fries were mediocre at best, but the Onion rings were crisp, firm, and delicious.  USEFUL: EVERYTHING IS SUPER SALTY. EVERYTHING. Water will get you nowhere. My lips continually shriveled up from beginning to end no matter what I was eating. I was re-applying moisturizing lip balm like it was the air I breathe. I may try to ask for \"Less salt\" if I ever go back!",

    "text": "Holsteins is a fun and fresh take on the hearty American classics - the burger and the shake. I can only speak for the burger (although I saw but didn't have space in my belly to try the shakes), but they do a good job!  We were greeted by a friendly host at the door and after being asked where in the restaurant we'd like to sit (bar, casual seats or dining), we were seated promptly. A very nice touch in giving such a choice so that we can fully enjoy the experience we would like to have.  As we walked through the restaurant to the dining area, we could take in the modern and colourful decor, dim but comfortable lighting and fun aesthetics, such as a life size cow statue.  As soon as we were seated, we were greeted by our server who offered iced water and menus. We went for two draft beers, a light and refreshing Peroni and a pint of the Holsteins house lager, which, although it came out looking like a dark bitter, was light in its flavours but with a subtle fruity aftertaste, which both my partner and I loved!!  With some complementary popcorn, which was a lovely touch, we ordered some onion rings to get us started as we perused the entrees. The rings was a good size for a side, cooked nicely without being too greasy and with a really delicious but punchy chipotle mayo to accompany.  We took the waiters advice and went for their Gold Standard burger, which has won them awards and the Forager burger.  Burgers took about 20-25 minutes to arrive, which we felt was a little while, but they looked incredible when they got there!   The Gold Standard was delicious! The patties are substantial and the did not skimp on the other ingredients either! The bacon added a smokey taste to the meat, while the garlic aioli was very flavourful and cut through all the meat very nicely, with the peppers adding a little sweetness.  The Forager was not as good in all honesty. Not as flavourful and I couldn't taste much other than the caramelised onions (which did taste great). The texture was also very sloppy. The egg was clearly too wet and oily for the bun and it all sort of fell apart and made the meat an undesirable oily taste and texture. The buns could definitely be better as they are quite thin, but tasty nonetheless.  From there, service slowed a bit as it got busier in the restaurant. The waiter didn't come back to ask about desserts or the bill so we caught his attention when we could and after asking for the bill, it still took a good 10 mins, which was a little frustrating as we had to leave to catch a show.  In all, a great place to mingle for an above average burger if you have ample time. The Gold Standard is very tasty and definitely the one to try. If we're at the Cosmo again and crave a burger and a beer, we'll definitely pop by!",

When you arrive to the front of the restaurant there's just a side desk. It's really weird and awkward. To the left there is a table and two chairs, where apparently you can eat. I guess it's attached to the bar. The place is incredibly busy and extremely loud. We couldn't hardly hear the hostess. Not only because it was loud but she was soft spoken. I guess they take your phone number and then call you for the waiting list. So odd, there's no where to wait and she said it was 20-30 minute wait.   We ended up only waiting maybe ten minutes before they called us.    After we are seated with the menus; about 10 minutes later Matt our waiter comes to take drink orders. We literally tried giving him our entire order but for some reason he ignored us and walked off to get our drinks and complimentary popcorn that was god awful.   It took about five minutes to get.   We finally are able to give our order and about 10 minutes later they bring out my sons meal and 20 minutes later we get our burgers and fries.    Although, we had a long wait for the burgers and fries they were amazing and the ranch dressing is outstanding!!! We ordered our shakes after because they bring them before the meal. They are very good shakes!!    Matt was very nice and when he was around was incredibly attentive. We were at the restaurant for almost two hours.  I feel like that is a really long time for burger, fries and shakes.",

The spicy sweet chili sauce was so good with the cilantro. I was surprised that I did not like the quinoa salad because I love fig. I thought the salad tasted odd but my daughter liked it. The Gold Standard Burger was delicious. The smoked bacon and tomato confit make it extra special. My hubby thought the party was a bit too salty. My daughter's favorite burger is the Rising Sun. All the shakes were delicious. I really liked the Black and White shake. This is one of our favorite places to eat when visiting Las Vegas.",

After a good yelp search, all signs lead me to Holsteins...which I know the name doesn't sound particularly salad friendly, but trust, it is. Plus, the bud wanted a burger and shake. So win, win.   Surprisingly, it was pretty difficult to find a good salad spot for an early lunch. And for a decent price. Somehow, this salad and a beer ended up costing about 40pp. How? I mean, it's Vegas, I guess. Sad.   But all in all, the free pizza flavored popcorn was a nice touch. The fresh salad ingredients were on point. The medium rare requested salmon actually came out medium rare. Woot woot. The sweet potato fries were standard. And while I didn't get a shake, they sure did look amazing.   I'd consider coming back. But it is pricey af. 4 stars",

    "text": "Imagine waking up in the middle of the night and you are craving a good old fashioned hamburger and shake. The only problem is everything is closed and you haven't gone grocery shopping in a good minute. You check the fridge and you got only about half of needed hamburger meat needed for a full burger, so you say what the heck, let's just grind up some mushrooms for filler. Then you got to build a milkshake and also realize you have like a cup worth of ingredients for the actual milkshake, but you have a chocolate chip ice cream sandwich and decide to mash that on top of your shake.   Bare with me here, this story goes better if you check out the pictures I included :/  Now that you have Frankensteined your meal together, you realize you have created probably the best burger and shake you have ever had. Not only that, but you also somehow get a restaurant located in a prime Vegas hotel because it's just that good.   Well that's my experience here. It seems like someone thought up some crazy ideas and they turned out to be delicious. A 50/50 mushroom and beef burger and a cookies and cream milkshake that literally has a whole ice cream sandwich shoved in top. Someone was smoking something.",

Worst yet, it wasn't even busy hour as it was past 9pm on a Sunday night when we arrived here. There were lots of empty tables around us so I'm not sure what this long hold up was all about. The waiter barely checked on us during this long wait as well. What a joke. The waiter did try to salvage this situation by giving us free popcorn during our wait but that was already after I asked them what the hold up was after 40+ minutes of waiting. Had I not asked and they not sensed the urgency in me, would they have given me the popcorn? Doubt it.    The GOOD:  The burgers, however, were freaking delicious! Yeah I admit, I was already annoyed as hell when I got my food, but I got to give it to them, their burgers are top notch quality. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.   I got the Gold Standard burger and it had the quality to match its name. Dry aged sirloin patty with smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, aioli, and some veggies. This burger is their signature burger but there are plenty others to choose from. I also had a few bite of the Forager Burger (Waygu beef and mushroom blended), and it was amazing as well. These were two of the more expensive burgers on the menu but definitely worth the price.   Something to note is fries do not come with the burger. You must order fries separately which is $6 ($11 for garlic fries). The fries were great as well.   Although my first visit didn't go as smoothly as I hoped, I would still recommend this place since their burgers are nothing short of superb.",

I sure appreciated the complimentary bucket of savory flavored popcorn - that was a nice touch!  We shared a Caesar salad, but I stopped eating it after a couple of bites because it was spicy with maybe some white pepper?    The Nom Nom burger had some cheese and crunchy potato chips in it. I added some ketchup for more flavor...haha!  It came with fries...maybe we should have gotten the Onion Rings instead... (note to self).  I would have eaten more fries (with ketchup), but I was distracted from the food because I was trying to listen to our conversation.   It's a fun, loud, busy place on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel on The Strip of Las Vegas. We enjoyed the cute cow themed cartoons and especially the cow wearing a Vegas Golden Knights cape!  Next time, we should get one of the milk shakes (they told me it's infused with alcohol)!

The items I was interested in were the burgers and shakes (duh). These had a twist to them. The prices are not steep for a hotel Vegas meal. Items Ordered: 1. Cheese Curds - So yummy and crispy. I perferred the mustard sauce and asked for ranch on the side (hey have good ranch by the way). 2. Banana Split Milkshake - HELL YES! 3. The Fun-Ghi - As a mushroom fan I was in. I did not expect so many mushrooms, so this was a pleasant surprise. There were lots of yummy flavors. The bun stayed together the entire time. Service was great but a slow. It might have been the because of the transition from breakfast to lunch.",

Gold standard was a really tasty burger and nom nom burger too, although I wish there would have been a bit more sauce in the nom nom as it felt a bit dry and boring. The fries that comes with the burgers are good too! We also tried the truffle lobster mac and cheese. It was alright? I've definitely had much better but overall the food experience was great and not too pricy. The service could have been better though. It took us forever to catch the waitress attention and get refills on our drinks.   However, the burgers are good quality meat and juicy so I do definitely recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Boy was this a fall from grace.   I used to LOVE Holsteins. I made sure to eat here every time I visited Vegas and I've been here four times now. I would rave about their burgers and fries to all my friends and this last experience made me feel like a fool for doing so.   A few nights ago my friend and I came here around 10ish at night for some burgers. I immediately got a weird vibe from the waiter like he wasn't too thrilled that we were there. Maybe it's because we didn't order drinks (neither of us drink alcohol) so he knew the tip would be smaller? I don't know. That's just speculation.   What I do know is that when we ordered our burgers, my friend asked if they could cut our burgers in half because we wanted to share. I don't think that's unreasonable when each burger cost $20. The waiter just said \"I'll bring you a knife.\" Um okay, that's not what we asked for but whatever. And I'm not saying this is a big deal but it gives you an idea of the kind of attitude they have here. It's not a make the customer happy kind of place.   I asked for my \"Gold Standard\" burger medium rare and the waiter said \"we can do it medium on the outside and pink on the inside.\" Um okay you could have just said yes to medium rare. It is a burger place after all...  When I bit into the burger it tasted damn near raw. It was very very pink and not what I expect from a medium rare burger. I couldn't finish it because I was afraid of getting sick.   Their fries were not the delicious crispy fries I remember having here. They just tasted bland and not really worthy of an extra $7.   I don't know what happened here. Maybe the success of this place finally got to them and they cut corners with quality and service. It's a real shame.",

The restaurant is cool, it has bar seating and table seating with dim lighting and fun decor. The menu isn't overwhelming it's apps, salads, burgers, and dessert, straightforward. I really liked how they paired beer with certain burges, I'm a sucker for pairings. Each burger comes with fries, you can upgrade for to onion rings or a side salad for $1-2 dollars.   It took me a while to decide on which burger to get because they all sounded so delicious. I went out of my comfort zone and decided to go with THE RISING SUN ($18.50) kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. I'm so happy I chose this burger it was very different, the patty was juicy, the teriyaki glaze was sweet and the spicy mayo was tangy, and the crispy yam gave it a nice crunch. The bun wasn't wasn't toasted well making it a tad soggy and the fries were good not great, they had a slight crunch and needed salt. The serving was just right, the burger wasn't huge and the fries were a good portion even with the burger.   The service was good and the price is fair. I would go back for another burger and maybe some dessert!",

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Vegas buffets, but Holsteins is just on another level.   The burgers here are ginormous. That's pretty much all I could think of and remember. I tried their Classic burger for $15.50. This is all I keep dreaming about! The patty was so juicy and it was definitely filling. I recently saw a lot of milkshakes all over Yelp and I definitely want to try them on my next trip to Vegas!",

And you must get some of their alcohol based shakes too. It's like the perfect dessert to compliment your burger. I got the chocolate smores shake and that was very rich. They make extras so you get a cup and a half and that is a lot already, coupled that with the burger, you are definitely putting in about 2000 calories for a visit.  And the 2000+ calories is worth it coming here. Your taste buds will appreciate you a lot. And their selection of beers on tap are very impressive as well.",

    "text": "The burgers here are good, but you're going to have to pay a premium price just for the fact that it's inside the Cosmo. Here's why you will pony up: you get what you pay for.   The buns were soft on the outside and toasted on the inside. When you ask for a medium or medium-rare burger, they don't overcook it. Lastly, the seasoning is on point without having a heavy hand with the salt.   I went with the Fun-ghi burger with roasted portobello, gruyere, and truffle oil. Each bite had the perfect amount of flavor without one ingredient overwhelming the next. I tried a bite of my friend's Rising Sun, which had tempura avocado, crispy yam, nori, spicy mayo and a patty with a teriyaki glaze. It was even more amazing. I liked that the burgers had flavor without sacrificing the texture. The beef patty wasn't soft like Umami.  Service was quick. They do automatically tack on 18% gratuity for parties of 6.",

I skipped the shakes but have had it once before (believe it was the grasshopper), they are a bit pricey (about $10 a shake without alcohol).  All in all would definitely return, but probably do what I did this time around and skip the shake.",

Some great looking chicks around here.   My wife and our friend got some of the shakes (I had to finish her burger so no desert for me). She got red velvet, he got a grasshopper.

Their Kobe beef patties are on point and super juicy (get it medium rare to medium done). The \"Rising Sun\" is their most popular burger. Just think about a burger with ingredients that are similar to a sushi roll! The lobster mac 'n cheese is damn good too! Made with real lobster meat and truffles, this is the ultimate gourmet style junk food that will make your mouth water!  Grab yourself one of their x-rated milkshakes. When I say they are creepers, it ain't no lie! Don't let the sweetness fool you, they are infused with a good amount of goodness inside that you'll be surprised at how buzz you are within minutes!  Expect to wait anywhere between 20 mins to an hour!  P.S. - Check in on foursquare and you'll get a free beer on draft!",

Well, if you like burgers give 'em a try sometime.  Olivia and I gave Holsteins a try and were impressed by two amazing burgers and great service. It's not cheap, but totally felt worth it. We split two and added a Fried Egg ($1 extra) to each at the recommendation of the bartender.  Burger 1: The Rising Sun ($17) with Kobe-style Beef, a Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Tempura Avocado, and a Spicy Mayo with a pile of Thick-cut Onion Rings. Simply delicious blend of beef, avocado, egg, and sauce.  Burger 2: El Machete ($16) with Fire-roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions and a Spicy 'Machete' Aioli with a side of Steak Fries. The Fried Egg really made this a great and messy burger. Even though it wasn't spicy, I still devoured it.   *** Which burgers are Holsteins Burgers?         Well, they're the ones with Bad-Ass Burgers printed right on the menu.  Both Holstein masterpieces were such tasty burgers, we tried to go back the next night, but they had closed about 10 minutes earlier :(. We even knew which two burgers we were gonna get: a Big Fat Greek Burger ($17) with Lamb, Feta Cream, & Tatziki Sauce and a Billionaire Burger ($28) with Kobe-style Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, & a Truffle Mayo. Next time.  *** You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down?       Ah, hit the spot.  Besides burgers, Holsteins is famous for its dozen or so Bam-boozled Shakes loaded with liquor. These three sound like especially tempting: Frozen Grasshopper, Creme Brulee, or Red Velvet Cake Shakes.  Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the East Tower and the Las Vegas Strip. If the place is busy, my suggestion is to get the burgers and shakes to go and then take them back to your room to enjoy them with your own tasty beverages and entertainment.  I never expected to give Holsteins 5 stars ... and it may truly be between 4 and 5, but compared to other burgers and disappointments in Vegas the super service and juicy, messy, and flavorful burgers of Holsteins stood out. Like Ahhhnold, I'll be back.",

For dinner I had the surf-and-turf quesadilla which was delicious and very filling.  Both other people in my party had burgers and no complaints.  They have reasonable prices for the Strip and can make their milkshakes virgin as well. The pizza flavored popcorn they give you to start is very good but it would be even better served warm (hence the 4 stars along with the small space they have).   I wish they advertised a little better because many people have never even heard of it. Make sure to check their Instagram beforehand to see special items that aren't on the menu!  We ended up with a Donutella shake (Vanilla and Nutella shake with Patron XO cafe, coffee anglaise, and garnished with a whole donut, a pirouette cookie, and chocolate covered coffee beans) one night that wasn't on the menu and I know they have some holiday ones right now!  The ones on the menu are very good as well.  Unfortunately, most of them have peanut elements in them which isn't great for those of us with allergies but the A-Chocolypse is safe! Can't wait to try other items at their Portland, Oregon location.",

We ordered:   Billionaire Burger - Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo  ----For $30 ($2 for added mushrooms) this burger was just okay.  Foie gras was kind of small, burger was cooked medium-well instead of well.   Came with side of fries.    I prefer the Rossini at Burger Bar.  At double the price it's kind of high, but the taste is 5 times better.    'THE RISING SUN'  - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado  $17 - Tempura avocado was huge, bigger than the burger and it looked awkward and hard to eat.  Bun seems hard to balance on top of it.  Otherwise it was not a bad burger as well.   TRUFFLE LOBSTER 'MAC N CHEESE'  - Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce With Maine Lobster And Black Truffle  $16.50 - Enjoyed this the most but Lobster Me does this better.   The single potato chip w/ lobster that comes with the mac and cheese plate was a great addition to this.  Should be it's own appetizer.  Strawberry milkshake ($8)  over priced, standard milkshake.     Servers were friendly  and accommodating.",

Once again, this place received pretty high reviews on yelp and by word of mouth (best way of marketing) and its right in my hotel (lucky me).  This place is right in the \"stores\" area across from the day club. But once you get in, it doesn't feel that way. The wait for a table was about a half hour, so I just grabbed a seat at the bar.   Ordered the Holsteins Special Lager, which is made right here in Las Vegas. Beers here are moderately priced... Served in either 16oz or 12oz. The tap list is pretty solid. I'd say about 20 beers on tap at once. I think they could make a killing if they do beer flights, but they do not offer that at this time. Also, maybe provide beer and burger pairings? The beer I got (which was the cheapest on tap besides Miller Lite) was not bad. Definitely a \"light craft beer\". But hey, beer is beer right? And I'm sure it will go nicely with the burger I got.   Got the \"Nom Nom Burger\" which comes with cheese, potato chips, and 1000 islands dressing. Not a fan of the dressing, so I subbed that out for some bacon which was an extra 2 bucks. Also upgraded to the onion rings because I heard great things about those. Got the food. Looks great. Onion rings are nice and crispy, which is exactly what I was looking for. Great first bite of the burger. Tasted everything in the first bite, which I think is key. Burger was great. I enjoyed it, especially the white cheddar cheese and bacon. I would go back for sure!",

Both times, we had fantastic service, with really nice and attentive servers.   We liked how, instead of bread, they put a bucket of pizza flavored popcorn on the table. Big hit with the family!  The menu is awesome! Hubby had the Longhorn burger and loved it. He also ordered some obscure Belgian beer and said it was the best beer he's ever had. The kids shared a burger (I forget which one). The loved it. Note: we asked the server to cut the burger in half but she said the health code prevented her from doing so, we'd have to do that ourselves. Interesting.   I had the Holstein beef sliders. Delicious.   Maybe I'm used to higher prices, being from Seattle, but we felt the prices here reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. Totally reasonable.   We returned a few days later for shakes. OMG, the family went crazy for the shakes. You can order their \"Bam-Boozled\" shakes without the alcohol. One kid had the Coffee and Donuts shakes; it came with a donut hole in it and chocolate espresso beans. She was up all night but in an blissful state. Hubby had the Drunken Monkey, and it was agreed upon, this was the best damn shake anyone had ever had. Each shake was enormous - definitely enough for 2-3 people to share.   Amazing place!",

These 4 items came out to over $70. Overpriced.   The ahi sliders were SUPER TINY and $15 for 3 tiny sliders.   The rising sun burger was alright. The teriyaki flavor was lost in the burger. The crispy yams, spicy mayo, tempura avocado, and spices on the burger overpowered the teriyaki sauce.  Overall I was disappointed with the outcome of the burgers and sliders.

I ate at the bar and the bartender was perfectly friendly but I found the atmosphere to be lacking and the draft beer selection relatively weak. I ordered a bit outside the box by getting the rising sun burger which is a Japanese take on their traditional hamburger. Although it definitely wasn't bad, it didn't quite work for me. I guess I felt like if I wanted the flavor profile of sushi, I would have rather ordered sushi/actual Japanese food. The burger itself was of high quality and tasted more like steak- perhaps it was a bit overdone for my liking but it was missing the fatty flavor of some of my favorite burgers. The onion rings were solid. I wouldn't not go back but will likely try one of the many other burger options in Vegas first.",

    "text": "Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan the decor is very cute with lots of cartoon artwork of the cow mascot. They have booths and tables, but also a bar seating area to the left side of the restaurant. Reservations can be made through OpenTable.  Thursday night after our third day of CES we were famished and irritated how the day was ending so far. BTW, never go to HTC's promotional booth that isn't at the convention center. Horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place out for years and never got around to it. This trip I was determined that we were going and what a better way to end a pretty bad day than a nice juicy burger and a good shake?  Our Order: ++Truffle Mac & Cheese: ($16.50) Tellegio-Marscapone sauce w/ Maine Lobster and Black Truffle ++Gold Standard: ($18.50) Sirloin Burger w/ smoked bacon, Tomato Confit, Goat Cheddar Cheese, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli  Add Fried Egg (+$1) ++Billionaire Burger: ($32) Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisse, Truffle Mayo Add Lobster (+$10) Add Sweet Potato Fries (+$2) ++Drunken Monkey: ($13) Reese's, Banana, Malt, Frangelico  Complimentary pizza popcorn came out in a little milk pail while we waited for our food to arrive. They change the flavor periodically but there's no schedule as to when it's changed. We inhaled the popcorn as we hadn't really eaten anything all day.  I've had the Rossini Burger at the Burger Bar (the $65 burger) and the Billionaire Burger isn't as juicy with a thinner patty. The Billionaire Burger also doesn't have the chunks of truffles that I liked. The truffle flavor is only in the truffle mayo. There was a nice chunk of foie gras but there was hardly any lobster on the burger. Kind of disappointing since you're paying $10 to add lobster. =/ My friend absolutely loved his burger. He had actually ordered the Truffle Mac & Cheese to add to his burger. He kept moaning with every bite he took of his burger. I'm not a fan of mac & cheese but I tried a bit anyways. The pasta was soft and there was plenty of gooey cheese. There were bits of something (possibly breadcrumbs) sprinkled on top that gave it a good texture contrast. There was more lobster in the Truffle Mac & Cheese than what was added on to my burger.  The Drunken Monkey wasn't too overly sweet and had real chunks of bananas. A bit lighter on the Reese's flavor though which was OK but I love chocolate and peanut butter and would've liked more. Couldn't taste the alcohol in it at all (which I prefer) but also pretty dangerous if you drink it too fast.  At the end of our meal our server brought out frozen mint meringues! They were in a tin milk pail and we just picked it up with our fingers from a spoon that scooped the meringues out. It was so amusing eating them because every time you breathed out, water vapors came out of your mouth that made it look like smoke.  Our server, Warren was amazing!! We vented about how bad our day was and he helped end our night on a great note. One point, we saw him & his co-worker dancing and rapping at the POS machine having a blast. He saw us watching and just commented, \"I love working here.\" You could definitely tell that he did. :) We spoke with the manager about how he did a great job and found out that it was his first week as a waiter as a promotion from being a table server. They're definitely lucky to have him.  Overall, the food would be a 4 star but because of the service, I had to bump it up a star. Definitely would be coming back.",

    "text": "The last time we visited Vegas it seemed like every casino added a gourmet burger type place to their restaurant collection. There is ABX American Burger in Excalibur, BLT Burger in Mirage and Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood just to name a few. This time we decided to try Holsteins for their adult milkshakes. Also my husband had been here before so of course I had to try it after all his rants and raving.  We came in for dinner on a Friday evening around 5:30pm. It wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. After taking some time to decide I went with the Rising Sun Burger and Oreo Shake. The burger was one of the best I've had of it's kind. It wasn't as big as burger from Red Robin but remember its quality over quantity. The patty was fresh and juicy, cooked medium as requested. The Rising Son had Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, and Tempura Avocado  The fries were crisp, golden, hand cut thick fries. I liked that they stayed crispy and weren't oily.  The Oreo shake tasted good but didn't seem to stand out from anything else I had before. I didn't even feel any of the alcohol. Maybe it was because I was full from eating or needed a double shot since the alcohol was Bailey's Irish Cream.  The restaurant was clean and service outstanding. Burgers are a little pricey but your getting a way better quality burger than Red Robin and hey it's Vegas! If anything stop in and have a shake. The shake menu is pretty extensive and I haven't heard anything bad about any of them myself. The other two shakes ordered at our table that night were the Creme Brulee and Black Cow. My husband says S'mores is still his favorite.   Whether or not I'm staying the Cosmopolitan the next time I visit I'd eat here again.",

I loved the mixed greens salad with added chicken, the avocado was a perfect addition. This hits the spot when you are looking for something still healthy; I was needing some greens in my life and this did it for me.   A few nights later I came to order a burger. Let me start by saying I'm not one to order a burger very often. But damn the rising sun burger was pretty tasty.  Make sure you get a side of onion rings.   For dessert you have to order one of the boozy milkshakes; I love the one with peanut butter Reese's and banana. But I heard the captain crunch one was also great. Truthfully I'm sure they are all tasty!",

I wasn't sure about its teriyaki glaze as I always fear sweet goopiness, but it was a really light glaze, and the crispy yam, avocado, and spicy mayo gelled together perfectly over the kobe beef. It was my first time there with a group, so I got to see all kinds of good burgers served that night - the Fun-Ghi, Gold Standard, and Urth Burger were all well-reviewed. Ahi sliders were tiny, but we were warned.   Washed it down with a gritty like I love oatmeal stout. I have yet to try a booze milkshake, but I also have yet to take a photo in the giant stiletto.

The restaurant has lots of whimsical original art, and everyone was friendly and prompt. We ordered the smore's milkshake and it was just OK. I got the Rising Sun burger, which was the most creative burger I've ever eaten in my life. It may look scary to some, but if you love Asian food, you will not be disappointed. The flavors and textures are unlike anything else I've tried. My boyfriend got the Nom Nom burger, which he thought was great, but BurGR did it better.  Expensive for burgers, but one of the few places that puts their money where their mouths are and deliver.",

Located at the Cosmopolitan hotel it was very easy for my boyfriend and I to walk downstairs to this place. The atmosphere was fun and lively. It had a bit of a kidish environment with all the painting of cartoonish cows on the wall (personally I think it was so cute and adorable). Friendly staffed. My boyfriend ordered the Funghi burger and I had the Rising Sun. I'm not a huge fan of truffle oil so I stuck with my Rising Sun which was a version of a teriyaki burger of some sort. Both were good. In the beginning of our meal they brought us some cheddar popcorn it was really good complimentary of course. Last but not least we had to order one of their famous milkshakes boozed it up Vegas style duh!  We had the Fat Boy. Haha it was pretty fatty.  Can't wait to go back next time!",

The brisket was an interesting addition to the burger and I'd recommend this. I had it with the steak fries and enjoyed the crispy and seasoned fries.   They serve you an interesting vinegar and butter popcorn while you wait for your food. One thing I'd recommend they do is allow you to create your own burger using more of their toppings from various \"unique\" burgers.

We added a piece of foie gras which elevated the burger.  It was one of the best I ever had.  The 3 alcoholic shakes we got were by far the best shakes we ever had.  The Pecan Turtle Cheesecake was the best.  It had caramel vodka and small pieces of cheesecake in it.  It was like eating a boozed dessert.  The Red Velvet Cake was solid too.  It had a mini whoopie pie and vodka in it too.  It tasted like taking small bites of red velvet cupcakes.     The Coffee & Doughnuts one was good too.  This is a nice place to get good burgers and shakes but you better bring some earplugs.",

    "text": "It is amazing to me how many eateries gut stuck with lower average ratings than deserves because of the entitlement and some great expectations that people pull straight from their imagination. In order to accurately review anything, you have to take it from the perspective and concept that is being offered.  So what is Holsteins? Holsteins is a casual, semi-gourmet burger joint with great late night hours, incredible appetizers, and cocktails and drunken shakes that meet and exceed exactly what they are out to accomplish. And as far as price? Extremely friendly for what you get and the fact that it is in Las Vegas in one of the pricier Hotel and Casinos.  I ended up going in twice on our trip - and both times I had the Gold Standard burger. Sharp cheddar goat cheese? To die for. The burger was so rich and flavorful I couldn't finish it either time.  The shakes? Leave room for one because these are some of the best and most creative shakes out there - and you better get the extra shot. This is Vegas after all.  A couple of suggestions: get the onion rings. The fries are decent but nothing special. However, the hand battered onion rings are in the upper echelon of onion rings I have tried in my lifetime (with the rings at Hodad's in San Diego the undisputed #1).   Lastly, everyone seems to talk about the buffalo dip, but don't shy away from the cheese steak eggrolls - because they are otherworldly. Make sure you set aside time and room in your stomach to go through appetizer, a burger and a shake, because you don't want to miss out on any of it.",

    "text": "All things considered, Holsteins is a solid 4.   Nestled in the Cosmopolitan, the Holstein experience offers satisfying burgers and sandwiches, all created with inventive deviations from the standard burger. We settled on the Nom Nom and the Chicken Club, one with sweet potato fries.   We perused the shake offerings, all looked amazing. I thought the concept of the adult spiked shake was a welcome Vegas style twist.   Cute gimmicky decor (think- Chick fil a with a twist, this time with pigs).   Not my first choice on the strip for a 17 dollar burger, but not a disappointment.",

    "text": "I ate here while in town for a conference. The prices are what you'd expect for a hotel restaurant on the strip, burgers around $15-$20. I was blown away by my burger, the Gold Standard, which had aged everything, including dry aged sirloin beef, aged goat cheese and bacon. The subtle flavors of the tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aoili all shone through to compliment this. These guys also cooked my burger truly medium rare, exactly as I wanted it cooked. The fries were hot and crispy. No complaints whatsoever on the food. My buddy had the Captain Hook, a salmon filet with smoked salmon on top and other savory flavors. He loved it, and the sweet potato fries were also crispy.   Holsteins gets points off for a couple things, both beer-related. We had a waiter in training. With of our waiters were friendly and kind. However, the experienced server didn't know any of the beers on their rotating tap list (6 breweries) and didn't offer to find out when I questioned her. Instead, she pointed to their standard tappers and directed me to a dark beer, my stated preference. If you're going to feature something like 40 different bottled beers, you should know what's on tap, too. This goes double if you're training someone. I ended up ordering a Left Hand Porter which came to me warm. Like room temp warm. I know this is how it's served abroad, but even the bottle says \"keep refrigerated\". I didn't say anything since we needed to get back to our conference.  I'd say Holsteins gets 4 stars if their staff can stay on top of their beer selection and service. Eat the grub! I might give them another try soon for a boozy shake.",

    "text": "This swanky burger joint is located right across the nightclub Marquee's entrance inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. From the artwork on the wall that reminds me of oldskool 90's taggers to the loud hip music blaring through the speakers, Holstein 's is hard to miss. We made it there around 7:30pm on a Saturday night and the wait was no more than 20 minutes for our party of four. When your pager starts buzzing and you report to the host at the door, you're ushered to the next host in the middle of place, which that person will walk you over to your table. The place is vibrant, loud, and hip. Just like in a NYC subway train, you have everything from skirts to suits to shorts & flip flops occupying this restaurant.   Many items on the menu sound appealing including their numerous $11 alcoholic shakes. We ordered the Frozen Grasshopper: peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, Van Gogh chocolate vodka. If you love them little minty & crunchy chocolate balls, then this shake is right up your alley. There's plenty of it, a bit overwhelming actually but some people like it that way. That distinct alcohol taste is barely noticed. We also got the Oreo with Bailey's Irish Cream. This is what I considered a \"safe\" shake to order. If you enjoy Oreos (who doesn't?) then this is a solid route to go. Again, the taste of alcohol isn't really prevalent. Warning, if you have issues with dairy then you may want to stay away from the shakes here. I really don't but it did activate.... uhh nevermind.   Seems like The Rising Sun $17 is quite popular from many of the reviews and sure enough someone on our table ordered it. Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake not to be mistaken by bukake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado. Seriously, what is there not to like about that set up? If it was truly an Asian inspired burger, then a fried egg would finish the job. You can add it though for a buck more. I was a little sad that I didn't order this burger for myself but my buddy was kind enough to give me a slice of heaven.   I ended up with The Steakhouse Burger $17.5: beef patty crusted with black pepper, Holstein's creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms, swiss cheese. Oh you fancy huh? Because it sure did sound fancy. Although the burger was good, my mind was set on The Rising Sun as the unanimous winner this night. The pepper was probably what I remember most about this burger. I did finish it but I most likely wouldn't care to order it again.   The Maine Lobster Roll $16.5: fresh cooked lobster tossed in chive aioli in a grilled mini hot dog bun with cole slaw. The price is steep, the portion is crazy bite sized, but the taste landed a Mike Tyson uppercut. Why oh why do you tease us like that Holstein 's? Gimme more!   The Steak Cut Fries and the Sweet Potato Fries were decent but can be better.   Overall, Holstein 's should be visited at least once and from there you can determine if you want to be a regular. The meal was quite enjoyable but I'm not sure if it left an uber lasting effect on my appetite glands. I can probably live with or without it. For sure, give it a shot. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays, they are opened beyond their normal hours, midnight to 2am. However, their full menu isn't available but rather a separate and shorter late night menu. Check out the art work on the walls, I want one for my place!",

    "text": "My husband said it, \"this gets a 5 star Yelp review\" and I agree! As a vegetarian it is so hard for my meat-lovin' husband and I to agree on restaurant choices but the Urth vegetarian burger was phenomenal and so was Jason's classic angus burger. I opted for sweet potato fries and they were perfectly crispy too. Sadly, I'm too full for a milkshake! We've been staying at The Cosmopolitan for five days and the best meal was right outside our room. Who knew?! Awesome job, Holstein's! The menu, the meal, the service earned you a rare 5 stars from this picky eater and her hard-to-impress hubby!",

    "text": "Great Burger.   Went on Memorial Day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. We were able to grab two seats at the bar.  I wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. I got the brown cow float. It was lighter and he still had to help me with it! It was so good. I love a good root beer float. I could taste the booze.  We both ordered burgers. He added an egg to the steakhouse burger. I got the funghi. Both cooked perfectly. They were delicious. Generous portions. The fries were ok but the burger was so big. Truffle flavor was there and the Gruyere was perfectly melted. It was a more refined mushroom and Swiss burger. In a good way. The fries were just ok. A place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. However props to including them in the price of the burger.  We got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. BF said the cocktail he has was well executed.   We will be back and next time I will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.",

Wasn't too busy yet, so we were quickly greeted to our seat and drink orders taken. Make sure to check-in because they do offer 50% draft with a purchase of a burger...not a bad deal at all in Vegas! To our surprise they even provided complementary Pizza popcorn...it was excellent! We could not stop eating them.  Since we knew we're going to have another dinner later on, we decided to try the Flyin' Hawaiian. It consists of a regular burger patty, grilled spam, a pineapple/teriyaki sauce, with cheese and spicy mayo. Just wow...the combination of all of those was one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. We ordered fries and added another side of onion rings for $3. The fries were good, but the onion rings were better--crispy and tasteful.  Since we didn't leave room for dessert, we came back on our last day in Vegas to try milkshakes...these milkshakes are basically milkshakes on steroids. I had the cookies and creme...and as much as I wanted to finish it, I couldn't. A full chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich on-top of the actual milkshake...it was amazing. What's good is they also provide you with the left over shake they couldn't put into the glass..definitely getting your monies worth!",

After that though, it was a bit dry and the lack of sauce made it hard to go down without a sip of water. Felt like a standard burger I could get anywhere else.  The Onion Rings: Well seasoned but very doughy.  The Beer: I had the recommended pairing which was a Full Sail Amber Ale. Lightly hoppy but complimented the burger well.   The environment was very casual, and it had cow pics posted everywhere.  Overall experience was good.  Tip: If you are a local nevada resident, you get 15% off your bill.  Also, check in through Yelp, and get 50% off your beer with the purchase of an entree.",

Tonight we went to Holsteins for my husband's b-day dinner and we saw that they changed some items on the menu. They took off the steakhouse burger, which was awesome.   I ordered the fun-ghi burger with a side sweet potato fries, and my husband ordered the classic with cheese and bacon with regular fries, but we were disappointed. I don't know if there's been a change in ownership or management, but the quality of the food has gone down. The meat was rubbery, not juicy like it used to be. The regular fries were whatever, and the sweet potato fries got mushy in the bottom of the tin.   If we didn't have a coupon and get the 15% locals discount, I would've been bummed to pay $23+ each for the food we received. Fat Boy's monster boygers and fries are better. I guess we'll try Gordon Ramsay's joints next.",

    "text": "Each time I visit Vegas, I always strive to try out different places. This time I wanted to check out what these shakes and buns are all about.  I brought my husband, baby and father in law here for lunch. It is definitely a swanky burger place in Cosmo. I definitely was a bit annoyed that they did not validate and we had to pay $7 bucks for parking just to eat here.  It is located by \"the chandelier\" area. The restaurant layout is pretty open. No solid walls separating you from the outside window shoppers. The design of the cows are cute and the wall tile things are flip arounds.  There was no wait when you went and was promptly seated.  My husband got the classic burger but modified to be a simple bacon burger. My father in law got the captain hook and I got the chicken burger. My husband also ordered a modified virgin oreo shake and I got a strawberry shake for the babes.  They give you popcorn while you wait for your food (fun).  We ordered the buttermilk onion rings as an app and that came out the same time as our shakes. The onion rings were fried to a golden crisp and tasted good with their chipotle dipping sauce but comparable to other places with the same item.  Strawberry shake tasted like they used real, fresh strawberrys and not the ones soaked in red sauce.   The \"oreo shake\" came with a ginormous cookie sandwich on top which filled half of my husband's stomach prior to receiving his actual meal. He also liked the flavor.  bacon burger: decent sized and good in taste. Nothing special.  captain hook: the salmon was beautifully grilled and topped with a piece of smoked salmon which my father in law liked. definitely a fancy smancy burger.  chicken burger: chicken was nicely grilled. juicy and not dry. sauce on the buns blended well together.   *all burgers came with fries  I didn't feel this place was worth all the hype. I can definitely get the chicken and beef burger somewhere else for cheaper (like Stacked in California). The salmon burger was fresh and delicious (worth the price). A lunch that consists of burger, fries, onion rings and shakes that comes out to well over $100 is a bit excessive.   Fun to try but probably won't return unless my wallet magically grows money.",

My wife also ordered a veggie burger and the Grasshopper bam-boozled shake while her coworker ordered one of the Angus burgers and the A-Chocolypse Now shake. The onion rings were decent, but the burgers were mediocre and overpriced ($18ish). Though admittedly that's not bad by Vegas standards. The shakes are a glorious sight to behold...unfortunately, they also taste quite mediocre.",

    "text": "Not only do Holsteins have the Best Burgers in Las Vegas I would wager they have some of the Best Burgers in the country! I honestly wasn't sure what to expect but this restaurant blew me and my tastebuds away!  After a long (and sober) day at the Encore Beach Club my girls and I needed a stiff drink and some hearty food, what better place than Holsteins Shakes and Buns?! I really didn't know what to expect, my friend had found the restaurant through Yelp and I'd seen a few signs so wasn't prepared for the sheer awesome that was this restaurant. It wasn't crazy busy yet (5.00pm-ish so we'd beat the dinner crowd) so we were given a nice booth-style table in the back with no wait time whatsoever. Holsteins decor is chic meets cute- murals of cartoon cows interacting various foodstuffs like sexy pickle ladies and meat patties with eyes and limbs line the walls, sounds weird but its really cute!  The menu is pretty vast but honestly don't even try and go healthy while you're here. They are famous for their burgers and shakes so you need to order at least one (or both if you have the stomach) of these items! I could not physically stomach a huge milkshake at this point in the day but the ones coming past our table looked RIDICULOUS in the best possible way so I lived vicariously through the other tables.  To start, my table ordered Mexican Car Bombs and the Lobster Mac & Cheese for appetisers. Sadly, I could not have the latter as I am highly allergic but the Mexican Car Bombs were the absolute BEST jalapeno poppers I have ever taste in my life. I wished there were more of them as they serving they gave just didn't seem like enough deliciousness! Both my friends got the Gold Standard Burger (one with a side of Onion Rings) and I ordered the Al Pastor. My burger was incredible! Juicy, flavourful and tender it was all the good things a burger should be. I couldn't stop eating even though I was getting incredibly full very quickly and I totally had to roll myself out of the restaurant. Also shoutout to the cocktail menu- I grabbed a 'Couples Retreat' which was super refreshing and very much what I needed after a long day at a pool party.  Holsteins is a MUST when visiting Vegas. Just DO IT!",

They have a variety of different burger options, ranging from the traditional ones to more unique, fusion combinations.   They have both sweet potato fries and regular fries, which are good flavor-wise but could be improved upon in regards to texture and crispness. A little on the soggier side.   The Thai steak salad was also delicious, with high quality steak and bomb, super flavorful dressing.   Our sever was terrific. Friendly, very attentive, and so accommodating. He brought me a to-go container of the complimentary flavored popcorn because it was so good and I was craving more after finishing our food.",

We had the Rising Sun and the Forager burgers and fries (comes with your burger).  Between these two, I likes the Forager Burger more. The Rising Sun did not have vegetables at all so I felt as if I was just eating meat and two buns.  I would come here again but I would try a different burger.  My Kobe Beef patty was a bit overcooked and was not as soft as I expected Kobe beef to be.    The fries were delicious, although nothing too special about them, they tasted good and crunchy.    The customer service was excellent, our waiter made sure we liked our food and got our check immediately after we asked for it.  Tip: If you check in, you get 50% off your beer!",

I went with the hen house burger (fried egg and bacon) with sweet potato fries, wife went vanilla and got the classic with shoestring fries. Burgers were great, accurately cooked - although so juicy that the bottom bun quickly becomes soggy. I was happy to see Shiner Bock on the draft list so I skipped the bamboozed shake, wife had a chocolate malt. She claims the malt was one of the best she has ever had, Shiner is always perfect.  Fairly full off of the cheddar popcorn, burgers and fries, we decided to not do dessert - EXCEPT for the Nitro Meringues. ORDER THE NITRO MERINGUES. A waiter brings them from the kitchen in a bowl of liquid nitrogen and serves them to you one at a time. I was having so much fun blowing smoke that I can't remember the taste.

The steakhouse was off the charts.  I wish I had a more sophisticated lexicon to describe the party in my mouth.  I've also had the oreo shake.  It's pretty filling and will ruin your night of drinking so beware.  but if you just want to taste something awesome and don't plan on wasting brain cells at a local drinkery... then by all means have a shake!  They are freakin dee lish.  And just enough alcohol to know this drink is naughty.  I like that they serve popcorn pre meal.  it gives ya somethin to gnosh while you wait to feast your face.  The service does lack ambition. The decor is is pretty stunning but then again the whole darn cosmo hotel is a visual buffet of art and splendor.  This is a great place to hang with the guys and get a few drinks while you eat and scope out gorgeous females.  I like this place. And I hope to return soon.",

Had I not had my heart set on a burger, I would have turned on my heal and gone next door (who had a friendly greeting just viewing the menu).  I overheard the table next to me going on about the ridiculousness of these horrid hostesses after being sat by one.  These girls had a \"what are you doing here?\" attitude. I imagine one of them answering the phone: \"Holsteins, you're welcome.\"  Perhaps Smiling 101 could be a start?  That being said:  Server (Kyle) recommended the Rising Sun burger and it was THE best burger I've had EVER.  Tempura avocado, nori furikaki, crispy sweet potatoes...give me one right this second.  Service was cool, friendly, and professional.  Nicely done.  Atmosphere was fun and lively, but the stupid bass from the DJ was literally vibrating the booth I was sitting in.  Let's go for quality over quantity here, Holsteins.   Bamboozled Shakes are inventively crafted, by suggestion had the Drunken Monkey...YUM.  1 star for door, 5 for service and food.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Holsteins. I love a good burger, and shakes with booze...yes please!!   I was there with a party of 12, and we were early for our 6pm reservation, but we were told we couldn't be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem, that's not unusual. By the time the majority of our party was there, they seated us. We were all ridiculously hungry, so were excited with the quick appearance of our servers. Because of the size of our party, they split our table in half. They attempted to split the bill as well, but we asked it to be kept on one. We quickly ordered some appetizers and waited in anticipation.   Lobster corn dogs: good, but not great  Fried pickles: extremely tasty!  Lobster mac n cheese: I only had a small bite of this, but could have easily eaten a whole plateful!  Philly steak egg rolls (I think): ehhh   So far so good...I was pleased with the appetizers, and ready for my burger! I kept it simple and ordered a classic cheeseburger, and it was great. I can't complain. I had it with steak fries which were also good. The overall consensus of the group was that the food was good.   So why the 2 stars? While the food was good, maybe even great, the service was TERRIBLE. Wait, I have to clarify, half of the table's service was terrible. While Pete's side of the table got their food right away and with no problems, Nicole's side of the table had several problems...   1. the birthday girl ordered a classic burger with Cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, wild mushrooms and NO TOMATOES. What she got was a cheeseburger with tomatoes, no onions, bacon or mushrooms. While I acknowledge this was not Nicole's fault, because she read back the order correctly, so someone messed up in the kitchen...what upset me was that by the time she got the right order, the rest of us were almost done eating! And throughout the whole time Nicole never came back to give us any kind of updates.   2. Someone else ordered a burger (I honestly can't remember which one) with brie and grilled onions. When she got her burger and opened it up, the brie was mostly rind and barely any cheese, so she asked it to be sent back and just asked for Cheddar instead. This also took a ridiculous amount of time.   3. Someone ordered a beer that never came   During this time another one of our party decided to say something to the Manager, Steve. As soon as we said something to him, he brought the burgers out. He was very helpful and apologetic, but he messed up too. The second burger was supposed to have grilled onions and it didn't, we noticed this immediately so the one who ordered it let Steve now, he immediately said \"Oh no, there are grilled onions on there, I saw them put them on\" Then in what seemed like a scene out of a movie or a cooking competition, she slowly lifted the bun to expose raw onions on the burger. Obviously Steve was left a little red in the face. To his credit, he did comp us those two meals, but the ordeal left the majority of us disappointed and upset. The birthday girl couldn't even finish half of her burger because she had been so hungry she was left feeling sick and unable to eat.   The duck fat fries were disappointing, but the shoestring and steak fries were yummy, and I also enjoyed the onion rings.   Oh and the server (who's name I didn't catch) who was pouring drinks, then \"tying his shoes\" while we talked to the manager...you're not slick dude.  We know you were listening, probably hoping it wasn't you we were complaining about.  What is most disappointing, is that the food is good enough for a return visit, but the service alone makes me not want to set foot in the place ever again.",

    "text": "Super fun and cute burger joint inside Cosmopolitan that will have me coming back for their Bamboozled Shakes!  Anytime you stick a menu in front of my face with a large selection of shakes with alcohol, I am impressed.  The handsome and friendly waiter suggested Gold Standard burger since he claimed  it has been named the best burger in Vegas.  For $17 I was hoping for some magical taste bud explosion but unfortunately it disappointed.  It was good enough but not something to be given a blue ribbon for.  I couldn't finish the bun as it was too much bun for the burger and didn't enhance the flavor.  The burger does come with fries so that helps with the cost a bit (a tad).  The standouts are the shakes.  Ohh yeah...ice cream deliciousness topped with an insane amount of fresh whipped cream.  Next time I am in town, I am coming here just for a shake or two!",

(I probably worked off my meal simply by shaking it in my seat!),  and to the tasty shoestring and sweet potato fries!  YUMM, nom, nom, nom.  you need to order because I said so:  *KOREAN BULL GOGI (the asian in me!) - the fried egg KICKS this burger into top gear - medium rare of course! *CRISPY PORK BELLY BUN - because its different and melts in your mouth!  I'm making this restaurant a staple to my Vegas adventures - it is that tasty!  It's also right across from MARQUEE nightclub - the hottest spot on the strip right now!  :)",

While they are known for award winning burgers my burger missed the mark. Despite the beef patty itself being extremely tasty, the grilled pineapple/ avocado combination simply tasted funky. The pineapple did not taste fresh. The fries were crispy and as plentiful as the burger. Quantity wasn't the issue.   Typical of the strip, this was an expensive meal relative to the value provided. It didn't help that staff seemed arrogant and disinterested.   If you are considering visiting here, I suggest a different burger and an alcoholic shake instead of a beer.",

    "text": "I took one star out from my previous review. And it is not because I didn't like my vegan food there. It was ok-ish. They cut down on our favorite beer.  Vegan shake was ok I was happy to finally have a shake, but it was to sweet and sour at the same time and I was really hoping that it would be spiked shake, but it was just regular one. Burger was ok but u can't really call it a burger if it is only possible to have as a lettuce wrap. Extra charge for vegan ranch is also kind of bummer in expensive places like this it shouldn't be a problem to include it with a burger especially if u advertising that u have vegan options.  In overall i would put it this way \"it is an option not a choice \" if everyone in ur party going to ate there u have a vegan option. But if all of u vegan, then go find a better vegan burger place.",

If you aren't a beer drinker try one of their delicious and larger than life adult(alcoholic) milkshakes. I tried the Oreos and cream shake and it came with a full sized ice cream cookie sandwich on top. Wow!!  Now for the burger- they are known for their Gold Standard Burger. Definitely Top 5 burgers I have ever had. The favors of the meat, goat cheese, bacon, garlic aioli and arugula were perfect.   Grab some friends or check this place out solo- you won't be walking the Vegas strip hungry after this meal.   Tip: They do take reservations and are located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "I decided to give this place a try after hearing so many good things about their burgers from different friends and family members. Holsteins is another great find on the second floor of the cosmopolitan hotel! The inside is super cute and cozy. When you arrive and order, they give you a cute little bucket of cheddar popcorn which is soooo good. I could not let go of that bucket- the popcorn was so good and such a perfect thing to munch on before your food comes out.   They have a variety of different burgers, milkshakes, sandwiches, salads, and yummy appetizers. We ended up ordering the rising sun burger and the nom nom burger. The nom nom had potato chips on the inside which was different. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of sauce in the burgers. The menu stated that the Nom Nom had 1000 island dressing, but it lacked it. The burgers were still pretty good! We also ordered some regular fries, which were delicious, crispy and perfectly seasoned. They also have the option of garlic Parmesan fries, and tater tots. We ended up paying 6$ for regular bucket fries which were really tasty! The burgers don't come with fries or anything FYI. Wish it had, because you would have gotten more for your money.   The milkshakes they had looked delicious. I regret not getting one. So now I know once I go back, which I will, I will get me a milkshake!",

The Coffee and Donuts one was good but the Drunken Monkey IS THE BOMB!!!!!!!! It is like a banana milkshake with reeses cups. It is so good, that I ended up getting it again togo on my last day. I literally went out of my way and walked from the MGM to Holsteins just to get this lol.  I got the rising sun (their burger) which is really good. Very flavorful, rich, filling, and their fries are good too. I'd say a solid 8/10 for the burger and a 9-10/10 for the Drunken Monkey",

I didn't get a chance to the weekend before but this past week, I did. After Marquee Day club, my friends and I headed over and waited about 25 minutes. When we got seated the server quickly came and took our order for drinks. For all you light weight alcoholic girls, this is the place to drink. The milkshakes are alcoholic but only contains 1 oz of alcohol. For many, that's way too less. But for me, give me my Peaches N' Creme! I'll be trying all the flavors, don't you worry. tasted no alcohol at all. But I love the fact of knowing I'm drinking in Vegas, still. :)   I got the Rising Sun burger. It was a huge patty with some tempura pieces and avocado. Avocado always makes the burger better. They gave options for shoestring fries or steak cut fries. Uhh.. SHOESTRINGS FRIES of course. I absolutely love shoestrings fries of all fries. On top of that, I also ordered the Holsteins cobb salad. I have to make sure to keep my food light if I'm going to all these pool parties, you know. I like the cobb. I'm not sure why people don't think it's worth it. I did note that the avocado slices were not ripe.   We had decent service. Could have been better because they don't come around and check up on you much. We actually waved down our waitress a couple times. But, it was a busy afternoon. The food was good and convenient being right across from Marquee on the 2nd floor. It's pricey but gourmet burgers are always double digits so it was expected.",

They do a good job cooking the burgers to order. High quality meat and you can taste the difference. It's not a fast food burger, that's for sure. I had this milkshake that was filled with peanut butter, and chocolate, and dreams, and wishes. I remember the food was really pretty good. I would definitely eat there again.

Predominantly our trip was based on a BBQ pilgrimage to the holy lands of BBQ but we had our fair share of burgers along the way.  We had the Gold Standard Burger and Buffalo Wings. The burger was outstanding with a medium rare, dry aged sirloin patty, smoked bacon, aged goat cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and chive and garlic aioli but as per the usual, I'll rewrite the menu slightly in adding wild mushrooms.  The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly and all the flavours worked well together but only thing that I wasn't impressed with fries weren't crispy which is a big oversight for me and often a comment on a restaurant because I wonder if they can't get fries right, what the standard of other items might be.  It was unfortunate that the Buffalo Wings were way too acidic and vinegary for me and the girlfriend declined to eat any more after her first. A little more balance in the sauce and also a little crispier would have made them awesome though.  Overall I'd definitely go back for a burger again but I'd make sure that I asked for the chips to be extra crispy.  Cheers!  Dave.",

The prices are reasonable, the service attentive, the drink menu extensive, and the servers attractive.   Cons: My burger was not quite what I had expected. I got the Korean Bulgogi burger that comes with a fried egg and kim chi. Sounds epic right? Turns out that the patty was drenched in some type of sweet teriyaki sauce, which I was not particularly fond of. Also, the prospect of Duck Fat Fries was presented to us. Sounds epic too right? Its more or less just a gimmick that resulted in overly hard fries with no extra flavor whatsoever. All in all, a decent filling meal with fresh ingredients and a nice atmosphere, but not THE best burger joint I have ever tried. I would go back to sample another burger because my friends did enjoy theirs (they got the \"Gold Standard burger.)\"",

    "text": "After skipping out on the hour and a half wait one night, we came back the next day for lunch eager to try the popular burger spot in the Cosmopolitan. The menu has an extensive offering of not only burgers, but also various other items like lobster rolls, tacos, and Asian pork belly buns.   I had El Machete, the tallest burger I have ever eaten in my life. The patty was at least an inch thick and extremely juicy. Usually I don't like the strong beef taste in burgers, but this one was not overpowering and the extra burger additions blended well together. The spicy aioli and fire roasted chilis added the extra kick that I love, and the pepperjack cheese was melting perfectly onto the nicely toasted bun. The onions added great flavor, and the lettuce and tomatoes brought the freshness that I always look for. I ordered the sweet potato fries instead of their natural cut fries, and they were fried to perfection. I had no problem eating my whole portion!   This is definitely a must-try in Vegas, although there are several other famous burger joints in the area. The broad burger offerings definitely make it hard to choose, so I'll be back to try out the other tasty looking items on the menu!",

The shake tasted just like a chocolate-covered strawberry! Totally hit the spot! It was a very comfortable portion for two people.   We added sprouts to our burger, which was excellent, I recommend you add those if you're a fan of sprouts. The burger overall was great and the fries that came with it we're totally up-to-par on the fries scale.  The service was cool. Everyone was nice and attentive, BUT they were almost too attentive. I felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant and it wasn't even a busy time - I was there on a Tuesday night around 9 pm. Otherwise, I had a great time at Holstein's and I will definitely come again.",

The wife had the surf & turf mini burgers and I had a burger with Kobe beef, potato chips and cheddar cheese (can't remember the name of the burger). We also had the Oreo shake with Baileys and kettle chips with blue cheese and French onion dipping sauce.  The surf & turf wasn't very good as it had this tiny piece of lobster with beef tenderloin.  The Kobe burger was good with a nice crunch from the potato chips but it feel short compared to other gourmet burgers I've had.  The Oreo shake was good but had very little alcohol.  A beer would've been better with the burger rather than the milk shake.  The potato chips were a good starter for our meal.  I'm glad we tried this place but not sure if we would come back.",

    "text": "Let's start out with the service. I can be very judgmental with a restaurant on how you are greeted. When we approached the restaurant, the hostess' were smiling and friendly. We had a party of 10 and put down our name. The hostess told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait so we decided to wait and help ourselves to ChinaPlobano right next door just to eat something to carry us over so we don't get grumpy because of low blood sugar levels. I put in my order and literally 5 minutes later, our table was ready. I was like \"WTH...I thought you said it's gonna be a 30-45 min wait, so now I'm stuck with dim sum and what I'm going to order off the menu.\" The waitress was very friendly but kinda slow at times. She never came back to offer anyone another drink/shake or refill my water.  As far as food goes...I agree with Mike H...the burgers are waaaaaaay expensive for how small they are, but then again...what do you expect...it's a restaurant in Los Vegas. I had the Gold Standard and wasn't very impressed. The menu consisted of some random burgers....I feel that if you wanna burger...\"THE MORE BASIC THE BETTER\" The \"Tiny Bites\" are literally TINY bites. Some of them cost almost as much as a regular size burger....if you want more bang for your buck....get a regular size. As far as the \"Adult Milkshakes,\" I don't drink usually but DAMN....the Orange Creamsicle....WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!! If anything that was the only thing that I would go back for.   I'd give the service a 2 and the food a 3. Like I said...I'd only go back for an \"Adult Milkshake.\"",

They brought out smoked cheddar popcorn when we arrived. Quite tasty. My husband got the wings, which were a generous sized portion and also very good. The fries were also crispy and delicious.   Go.

    "text": "My first trip to Vegas was a total culinary disaster. So this time, I did some research. I'll admit, what drew me to Holstein's wasn't really the food...it was the boozy shakes. Drunken Monkey? Yes, please. And that's what I ordered, which turned out to be delicious beyond my comprehension. Whoever thought to mix banana gelato and Frangelico deserves to be worshipped.  The food was equally as outstanding. When I ordered my Rising Sun burger \"medium rare to rare,\" my server warned, \"The rare is cold and red, while the medium rare is warm and red. Would you prefer it warm or cold?\" And so I ordered it medium rare. And out it came, warm and red and juicy Kobe beef. I was shocked that for once I didn't have to overcompensate in my ordering just to get a decent amount of pink in my burger. The toppings were perfect (you can't not love tempura avocado, really), and even the teriyaki glaze, which I was skeptical of, wasn't overpowering. The shoestring fries that accompanied it were great, especially with a side of truffle mayo.  On top of everything, our server was excellent and very attentive, which in my experience hasn't been the norm in Vegas restaurants. Holstein's reassured me that there, in fact, IS good food to be found on the Strip, and I will certainly be returning here on my next trip.  Update: I FINALLY got back here and had the Gold Standard burger this time. A little overcooked, and not as bold in flavor as the Rising Sun. Also, the fries were thicker and not as crisp--why the change?! I'm not as in love with Holsteins as I used to be, but it's still one of my favorite affordable spots on the Strip. I'll be back a third time for sure!",

My only complaint was for a casino/restaurant in vegas, they had tiny bathrooms with only 1 toilet.  Lots of people are drunk and drinking in vegas and I wouldnt want to have to wait in line to go to the bathroom, although I am sure there are others close by. Oh and we were not allowed to take our drinks in that we ordered at the chandelier bar across the hall while we waited. We had to suck them down quickly in order to be seated.",

A word of caution, if you get a hamburger, (I got the Nom Nom burger) be careful as they are hot.  Hot enough to burn your mouth.  It's a good burger, the onion rings are really good but the shakes are just standard - at least my chocolate shake was.   That was my first visit and I would have said it was a 4 star experience.   The second time I got the Truffle Lobster Mac and Cheese (almost $17) and the Philly Egg Rolls ($13).  While the food was good, especially the egg rolls I felt taken.  The amount of food for almost $30 that you receive was PATHETIC.  I was completely blown away.  I wish I would have gone elsewhere and had it not been for my first experience here I would have rated this place a 1 star joint.  I would recommend this place if you don't order anything from the Nosh menu, unless of course you're just rolling it and don't care to be ripped off.",

Most of the restaurants weren't opening until later that day (opening weekend of the hotel) so we didn't have many options.  We waited a while before being seated, despite the fact that there were numerous open tables and TONS of staff just STANDING AROUND.  It took about 15 minutes before anyone approached us. Staff was EXTREMELY disorganized, but I'll give that to them since the establishment had hardly been open for a few days.  Our food came and it was pretty good, despite the fact that the kitchen didn't get our orders right. My medium well burger was pretty charred and extremely overcooked (well done).  THEN, MY FRIEND PULLED OUT A HAIR FROM HER BURGER!!!!!  We told one of our waiters (won't even get into the confusion with this), who informed the manager and told us he would speak to us. The manager never approached us. At this point, we were extremely fed up. After the waiter spoke to him again, the manager came to our table, apologized and asked to replace the meal. We ordered our friend a chicken caesar salad salad and a shake since the poor thing hardly had a quarter of her burger.  Our waiter brought out the salad and shake to go along with our bill and informed us that the manager would not exclude the shake from our bill. Considering the above events, this was pretty ridiculous.   On top of it all, there was no chicken on the salad.  THE END.  Wish Jose Andres new restaurant upstairs was open as this was our first choice. At least we got a glimpse of the chef while we were checking that place out.",

We ordered a Spark and Oreo Milkshake to go with our burgers.  Burgers were cooked perfectly and were outstanding.  The Sparks were so good we had three.  Went back to Holsteins a couple of days later for dessert.  Lollipops were to die for. The Strawberry Shortcake Slider & Fries were just okay.  Third visit to Holsteins on the last day.  Ordered two Sparks this time.  The waitress asked how they were and we said they didn't taste as good as the ones on the first day.  She said it might be a different bartender but took our drinks back.  We were surprised when she came back and said that we were right and the bartender realized he had forgotten the agave nectar and was remaking our drinks.  Second try was better but definitely a different bartender makes a difference!  We didn't realize how much time had passed until the manager came up to our table and said, \"I'm sorry you are waiting so long for your food. We lost your ticket.  I'm sending over some Artichoke Guac so you don't starve.\"  He offered us two more complimentary cocktails but we said we were good with the water.  The Artichoke Guacamole arrived and was very good.  Our Longhorns arrived shortly after and were worth the wait.  The service on all three visits was first rate. Would highly recommend Holsteins.

The \"skinny fries\" that came with my $13 burger were skinny, alright...in a faux \"milk-house\" bucket cept it was about the size of a Wisconsin thimball.  I ordered a chocolate milkshake $11 as well.  It was nice, unfortunately it was also about the size of a medium coke at McD's.  Service was OK. You know, when I compare this place with any other burger-joint, it might fare pretty well...but my tab was nearly $35...and for that amount of dough I could've eaten 10 HappyMeals and puked in the parking lot.",

    "text": "Decent food, stellar service. The cost of a burger meal paired with a shake is pretty expensive. We spent over $100 on 4 burgers, fries, shakes and a couple of sodas. The quality of meat was beyond standards, so I appreciated the taste even more. The complimentary popcorn that is served prior to your meal is a nice gesture and very flavorful. The shakes were good, nothing special that I couldn't make myself. So all together the most epic part of our dining experience was the high level of customer service and friendly ambience.  The wait time was next to none and the attentiveness of the staff was terrific. Again as for as the food is concerned it's not worth $25 unless you're just feeling like a fancy burger patty and a speciality milkshake. Otherwise yourself a favor and save your dough. 5 stars for the service, 3 stars for the food and inappropriate pricing.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge burger or beef person but after reading reviews and looking at the mouthwatering pictures on Yelp, I just couldn't resist. My mother and I were in Vegas for a few days and made our way to Holsteins for some juicy burgers. We came on a Wednesday afternoon so there was plenty of seating and not a lot of people there. It's located inside the beautiful cosmopolitan hotel.  I went with the rising sun (medium well) with sweet potato fries and my mom ordered the big fat Greek (medium well) with onion rings. I honestly think the rising sun is THE best burger I've ever had. The kobe beef was so juicy, flavorful and literally perfect. The mixture of flavors blended together so well and each bite was like an Asian fusion explosion in your mouth. Amazing!! The crispy yam and tempura avocado add a nice crunchy texture to the juicy beef. I really enjoyed the mixture of flavors and wasn't overwhelmed at all. My mom said she enjoyed her burger as well but I was too full to take a bite of hers. I did taste her onion rings though and they were fantastic! Crunchy, not greasy and the perfect size! Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try a milkshake but I saw a few people order them and they are a work of art. Almost too pretty to drink.   I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Vegas and I'll make room for a shake as well. Great restaurant with a cool vibe and amazing burgers!",

    "text": "It's both a blessing and a curse that that Vegas is so far away, otherwise I'd be visiting Holsteins on a far more frequent basis.  In contrast to the sharp trendiness of the Cosmopolitan Hotel itself is Holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word \"indulgence.\"   Our wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a Monday lunchtime visit - so I wouldn't be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.  According to the restaurant's website, Holsteins no longer offers its Crispy Calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. The calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. The Tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. I hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that I've had in recent memory!  For our burger selection, we shared a \"Fun-Ghi\" Burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. Indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave the burger an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. The patty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.  We also split an order of Truffle Lobster Mac-N-Cheese (might as well go all in if you're indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). In contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn't overly rich or oily. Its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented the burger quite well.   In sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and I were pretty much stuffed. The portion sizes were bigger than what we're accustomed to getting for the price (cough, Umami, cough). This being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is Sin City after all.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the famed Holstein's \"adult\" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. In particular, the \"Red Velvet Cake Shake\" really jumps off of the page!  While the whole \"high-end burger\" scene seems to be flourishing into quite the business these days, places like Holsteins prove that there are ways to excel at both image and execution. I'll certainly be back.",

Holstein's charges $3.00 to sub out the fries for a salad.  This was a very small salad in a small cereal bowl.  Really?  That's ridiculous!  Also the salad consisted of mostly arugula, a few very thin slices of cucumber and maybe two cherry tomatoes.  That cucumber was sliced so thin it couldn't have been more than 1:4\" before it was sliced.  I just don't get the $3.00 extra charge.",

Also, maybe my memory is foggy, but I feel like a lot of the stuff is so much saltier than it was before.  I still think this is a solid spot for burgers, and the alcoholic milkshakes are still to die for. In my last review I mentioned the Drunken Monkey, Frozen Grasshopper, Pecan Turtle Cheesecake, and the Coffee and Donuts; I'll add the Red Velvet to that list. I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the Bananas Foster milkshake, though. It was just too sweet - which probably seems like a silly complaint given the subject matter - but given how much of a sweet tooth I have, I'm going to guess then that it is way too sweet for most people.  Gold Standard and Funghi are still my faves for burgers. I've come to like the Rising Sun, too.  Hopefully the service can pick up a bit and I can think about bumping this place up again.",

The terikyaki glaze isn't so much a glaze - it's goopy and way too sweet. Thus, I couldn't even drown it in ketchup. If you love the taste of beef jerky, you'll like this burger!

You wouldn't know it by the taste of this shake, thick and rich tasting and I like the fact that they gave me  the metal  container which was another half shake! So filling but one of the best shakes ever I've encountered  I'm looking forward to returning and checking out the lamb burger!",

I wasn't feeling up to a burger (we ate later in the day and we were going to a show) so I decided to the the bulgogi quesadilla. I asked if I could get the kimchi on the side and they said no, which strikes me as weird since don't they assemble it there? They said it was already mixed together. So, I decided to get the popcorn shrimp, while everyone else got a burger.   I heard good reviews about the burgers but I didn't try any. I tried their fries and they were great.   My popcorn shrimp came with actual popcorn but the shrimp and popcorn were the same (delicious) flavor. A little difference could have been nice. It was a small size but it was good for what I wanted. I'd like to come back and try a burger.   Side note: food takes a long time. We were there for almost 2 hours.",

There's lots of TVs to catch a game and service was great; my waitress was extremely attentive, I think her name was Ashley?   Anyways on to the food, the Rising Sun is unique, as it is Asian inspired and I like tasting something different, so definitely give it a try if you are adventurous! The Gold Standard was a more classic burger. We got them medium rare and they came out perfect, also served with some thin and crispy fries. Bonus: if you check-in they'll also give you a free draft of beer through their Yelp offer. Cheers!",

    "text": "Burgers are probably one of my favorite foods in the whole wide world. I mean....bread, meat, cheese, and stuff - nothing better than that. I crave them on a regular basis. At least 4 times a day.  So while in Vegas, I looked for burgers. And my research was made pretty easy because they are EVERYWHERE. Food trucks, chains, gourmet (hello Hubert!)...you name it. And then I stumbled upon Holsteins reviews, and I read a couple of magic words: spiked shakes. I was sold.  Turns out, that was a pretty good choice. Holsteins actually uses the tender meat of its namesake breed of cow/beef and the result is a juicy, flavorful patty of deliciousness. ******Nerdy time: Did you know?**********  1. Holsteins are little Dutch princesses. Read: The Netherlands are their country of origin. I hear that their mooing is quite harsh to the ears, and they love eating tulips and gouda, but not always together.  2. They are the highest milk producers in the world. Hence the MILK shakes, duh. They are the lovely black and white \"meu-meu\" of my childhood, and I love 'em.  3. One of them - Pauline Wayne if you please - was the official pet of President Taft and was allowed to graze on the White House lawn, the lucky bitch.  ********End of Nerdy TIme***************  The sad thing? They are only in Vegas. The good thing? Since you are reading these reviews on Yelp, you are most likely in Vegas and can enjoy without gilt. Hurray!  We shared the Gold Standard with dry aged sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby aregula and garlic-chive aioli (at a whooping $17.40), and the Steakhouse Burger, a patty crusted with black pepper, Holsteins own creamy steak sauce, marmelade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  And people, that was pretty close to perfection. Great combination of flavors, a medium rare meat at its best, crispy fries and a Grasshopper milk shake.....aahhhhh.... Leave your calorie counter at home, in the hotel room or in your pocket. Just enjoy.",

    "text": "Burgers are played out.  There, I said it...  It seems like no matter what major city you are in, there's some strong competition on who has the best burger.  It isn't as if we see the same thing with who has the best beshbarmak (go ahead and look it up, edu-ma-cate yourselves), right?  But with that said, I must admit, I'm a bit of a burger fiend.  I do love me a good burger.  Always medium rare, and I also tend to look for interesting topping combinations to see how creative the kitchen is.  This is where I've been going wrong all this time.  You see, something needs to be said and credit needs to be given to the places that honor the burger for what it is SUPPOSED to be.  A patty made of ground beef served between two slices of bread, usually in bun form.  Toppings are typically added to compliment the meat and bread combination.  That's it.  It is with that in mind that I have to say Holstein's does a pretty mean burger.  Their meat is spectacular.  Maybe the best beef patty out there.  Assuming they use their namesake breed, I can tell you that the beef is very flavorful, and yet holds up in its patty form without being too greasy.  We split two orders with the notion of being able to taste a couple of their burgers.  Both were quite nice, and had pretty simple toppings.  The bun is notable since it has a lovely glaze on it and holds up well to all the juices that come off the patty and toppings.  The meat, as noted before, is the star.  Toppings, at least in our case, were more like condiments that complimented the beef rather than over powering the flavors.  In a way, very simple, but done correctly.  It also needs to be said that the Frozen Grasshopper is amazing.  Imagine a Shamrock Shake with booze in it, except it still just tastes like a better version of the Shamrock Shake.  Got it?  Yep- it's really good...  Beer selection is a'ight.  Prices are a bit steep compared to many \"gourmet\" burger joints, but PLEASE REMEMBER where the hell you are.  Does ANYTHING come at a \"reasonable\" price on the Strip?  When you consider that fact, I'd say Holstein's actually is a very reasonable place to grab a meal.",

She was very polite but not very attentive. After we ordered the food, it came out sooner than we thought. We ordered the rising sun & the gold standard! Both were very tasty, rich and juicy. The food covered the exceptional service. After our meal, we ordered the grasshopper milk shake which was phenomenal, I am not a huge fan of mint but my boyfriend is so I gave in to his liking.

We went here for mid day snack before dinner at 8.   My husband loved his burger The Billionaire burger consists of Foie Gras.  He's been craving for it.  He mentioned on the drive to vegas, he has to find a restaurant that serves Foie Gras.    Everyones burger is outstanding, I couldn't finished a burger so I decided to order the Cuban Street Tacos, big mistake!! it was so oily - gross, greasy -gross, the shredded chicken was so dry - gross!  I excused myself and went back to the Pai Gow table.  The Restroom was so so filthy, no toilet papers, and paper towels were thrown everywhere.  I went out and let one of the staff know.  And she got right to it.  Thanks!!!",

    "text": "5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service.   My fellow Yelpers, you did not disappoint. My friend and I came here after reading reviews on Yelp. We always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity.   I had the Billionaire Burger, and yes, it is DEFINITELY worth the $28!! After California banned foie gras, I was heart broken. I didn't know when I will be able to eat it again, so when I saw the Billionaire Burger on the menu, I had to get it!  This burger is made with kobe beef, FOIE GRAS, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. This burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. I usually get cheese on my burgers, but I opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. If you absolutely need some cheese, I'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere.   When the burger was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. There was a HUGE piece of grilled foie gras on my burger. I was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, I was wrong. The foie gras was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. There was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! You definitely get the bang for your buck here. The burger came with a choice of shoestring fries (which I recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries.   Another tip. If you check in with Foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. I don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try.   For the service, it was just non existent. Our server took so long to take our orders. We sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. I think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that.   All in all, yes, I definitely felt like a Billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger I had in my life! I can't wait til I go to Vegas again.",

There are tons of street chic art hung all over the walls of the restaurant which makes its interior design fun and appealing for guests. Since it's  more of a casual setting it's a nice place to bring friends even if you don't plan on going to Marquee or anywhere else fancy for the night.    They have shakes mixed WITH alcohol, called their bam-boozled shakes. My absolute favorite is the Birthday Cake which has 3 Olives Cake Vodka, Birthday Cake Crumble, vanilla ice cream and sprinkles. OHHH SOOO GOOD. It. Is. To. Die. For. Plus they give you the tin they make the shake in so it feels like you're getting extra. Adding a little to the waist? I don't mind for this heavenly treat.  The sides are fantastic. Truffle lobster Mac n cheese... Need I say more? They have great tiny buns too and some great Chicago dogs if you aren't too hungry, but still want a great meal.   Now the burgers are what you should come here for. Try any one. I'm sure there isn't one that will disappoint your taste buds. Can't choose? Well you can't ever go wrong with the Gold Standard. All the burgers come with either shoestring fries or steak fries. Just perfect. Prices might be a bit high, but you are paying for quality food.   Overall, Holsteins is an awesome environment situated within the classy Cosmopolitan. I must go back. Now.",

It's a mix of sweet, salty, and spicy, but what brings it all together is the runny fried egg. The burger is a knockout -- like a Taekwondo kick to your tastebuds!  Not one to skip the opportunity to get liquored up, I also had the Campfire Smores shake. I couldn't really taste the vodka (a good thing perhaps) but the shake was really delicious.

I, personally, had the Almond Joy (with coconut rum)...SO SO GOOD!! Food was good, but nothing to rush out and try.  My only, and biggest, complaint was the volume. It was busy, but we literally had to yell to the person next to us just to have a regular conversation. This is one of my big pet peeves in a restaurant, and it would make me not want to return. I know it isn't the restaurants fault, really, but it makes me crazy.  I would say check them out if you happen to be in the Cosmopolitan (or if it is National Milkshake Day).  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The shakes are fabulous. They are delicious, huge, and beautiful. A feast for the eyes just as much as for your taste buds. They are over the top and impressive if you have guests from out of town. They really do belong in Vegas.  My problem with this place is the food is just average, and of course, you pay Strip prices for it.  On my last trip here, we had 2 shakes (The S'mores & Grasshopper) & 2 orders of fries and I paid $60 with the tip. I feel like that's a little ridiculous.",

I read that they specifically created the restaurant for the Cosmopolitan, which I'm assuming is True because they both have a very cool, similar vibe.   The alcoholic milkshakes are amazing (try the Oreo - it comes with Bailey's) and the popcorn that comes on the table is magical. I don't know what their secret ingredient is but I need to find out.   My only complaint (and not even that) was that there are flat screens everywhere showing football games. My boyfriend was glued to the screen, which was great for him, but made me slightly annoyed since I don't care for sports.   There are also endless options for how you want your burger. Being a cheese snob, I had to go with the stinkiest ones possible - it takes burgers to the next level. I opted for a regular beef burger but the lamb burger sounded amazing - can't wait to try it next time - because I will definitely be back.",

We waited to see our server, but it was apparent that it would be faster to go ahead and just scrape it off ourselves. I took a bite of my burger and the meat was very tough. I asked my friend and she thought the same thing. The bread looked fantastic, but it was a bit too chewy and hard to eat. We both ended up only eating half of our burgers. Our server was very nice, but he only checked on us the minute our food came before we even tasted it and we didn't see him for another 20 minutes when we were already finished for our meal.

It's spiked with some kind of seasoning I can't figure out. Either way, it's an explosion in your mouth and your taste buds will be a little confused.  Burgers are pretty massive. I got the Hen House. (Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup) no mustard and no onion for me. But wow, the bacon in this burger was some thick cut bacon. And the egg of course made the burger sooo much better. I got a side of sweet potato fries and yea.. I couldn't finish my meal. Ha. My friend and I split a strawberry milkshake as well. Typical American burger meal . It was my last meal in Vegas. It certainly hit the spot and sent me home right.   The restaurant is inside the beautiful Cosmpolitan right in front of Marquee entry.

This place is tough for vegetarians, as you might expect, but not impossible. You can change out a burger patty for a veggie burger and there are salad options as well. If you use foursquare, you can check in for a free beer or margarita with signature burger purchase, and that works for every member of the party- pretty cool. My group of 6 took advantage of that.   The free margarita is pretty dang small, and you get no choice in flavor, so I would go with a beer. I ordered the Carbonara Chicken, while friends went with salads, Urth burgers, and The Rising Sun burger. I believe there were some others in there as well but I can't recall. The burger was great! Soooo good. It was a chicken burger with an egg on it, which I didn't expect to be into but it was awesome. Add to that a funny server that gave us good gambling advice (hit up somewhere off the strip- Ellis Island specifically), and we were happy campers. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Let's start with we live in Las Vegas and like any other Americans love a good hamburger from time to time. We decided to try this place a couple years ago on Christmas Eve. Well, all I have to say is they are now tradition and any other time we want some beef.   The staff is great, friendly and helpful. They tell you their likes on the menu and things you may just want to skip.   The burgers are great, little messy but hey you are getting a hamburger. Oh and the turkey burger is awesome.   Fries are fries but the onion rings are just the best. Not big, not small, not oily, just good.   Milkshakes - WOW!! Just try any of them.   Bottom line if you want a hamburger you need to go.",

I chose it so my friends trusted me and we were amazed. Even though we were hella hungover, we were cured by the burgers. Most of us had \"The Rising Sun\" and wow you need to try it. The avocado tempura took it over the top. It made it a nice Asian flavor. The Kobe beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. Brenda enjoyed her burger even though she didn't even come close to finishing it. Cam liked his except he found a hair in it. We really didn't like that. Taylor added grilled onions to his \"Nom Nom Burger\" and he acted like he was satisfied. Andrew killed his obviously. Willy was a little under the weather due to the alcohol he consumed the night before but nonetheless he said his was also awesome. We got free beers because we checked in on Yelp which is a major bonus. Justin our server was amazing and very helpful. I recommend if you need a nice little break from the clubs and booze. Thanks guys! We were stuffed!",

    "text": "SO PRICEY but really good. At $16-$18 per burger, it's pricey, but it's Vegas; you gotta be prepared to pull out the cash.  They are pretty creative with the burgers, I'll give them that. The burger patties themselves aren't that flavorful, but it's all the different toppings and condiments on each burger that make each burger tasty.  I've eaten here twice with friends and these are the burgers we've tried that have been consistently good:  The Billionaire - foie gras! Not a huge piece of it, but you can certainly taste that it's there. The Rising Sun - essentially a teriyaki burger, but it's got a good rich but sweet taste to it. The Golden Standard - can't pinpoint any one thing inside this burger that made it taste really good, but the moment you take a bite of the whole thing it comes together wonderfully! The Nom Nom - texture with potato chips inside and tasty special mayo sauce!  MILK SHAKES (alcoholic ones!):  Red Velvet - my fav, really delicious can't taste the alcohol at all. Little cookie bits inside for texture. Tiramisu - strong but tasty. Lots of cookie and chocolate toppings, chocolate syrup and cookie bits inside! Mint chocolate chip - only alright. Didn't mask the alcohol that well, tastes pretty simple, like melted mint ice cream with cookie bits inside.  AND OMG GET THE LOBSTER MAC 'N CHEESE. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. But it is so damn small for how much you pay for it ($18). It comes out in a small...I'd say 5\"x4\" cast iron tray. If it weren't for the price, I would just eat three orders of the lobster mac and cheese for the entire meal.  Service was only O-K. The waitresses usually seem distracted because the place is so busy, and the food didn't come out very fast. They refused to seat 10 of us at a table and split us up 7 and 3 and told 3 of us to sit at the bar, but there were no seats available at the bar because it was a dinner rush... so we just pulled up three chairs at the table and everyone fit just fine.",

We really were expecting a lot from all the other reviews, but it WASN'T AMAZING,,,  I got the Tiny Buns - Turkey burgers, which come in 2, and they are served which a small (shot size) cup of homemade potato chips (fits about 4-5).  It was very very good, and I guess the size is right if you aren't too hungry.  My boyfriend ordered a mushroom beef burger, and that was just OK.  The beef could be better seasoned, but the taste might be better masked for those who order bacon and sauces on their burgers.  Their fries were nice and crispy and a very satisfying taste.  My boyfriend also ordered a Banana milkshake, which he orders everywhere we go!, and he did describe it as, \"the best i ever had!\"  The service was a little bit slow and not as attentive as desired despite the fact that they weren't that busy.   Food was good, but not crave-able and most likely will not go again!",

Overall, I would say the burger is nice, but since it was located inside the Cosmopolitan right across from Marquee night club, it was extremely noisy and the burger was slightly more pricey considering it was on the strip of Las Vegas. I paid about 22 bucks for a burger fries tips and taxes included. The burger itself was 18ish for a burger and fries.",

Milkshakes were extremely bad - to the point where none of the four of us finished even half.  Hershey's syrup in a cup, that's the best way to explain it.  The burgers were frozen hockey pucks.  You're better off at In N Out if you want anything that resembles fresh ingredients.    Points for service and the appetizers, which were mediocre, but the best of our meal!  Alternate Reco: BurGR (excellent) or BLT Burger if you want the milkshake + burger combo.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "I was looking for somewhere to have a birthday dinner with a large group before going to Marquee on a Monday night, and we picked Holstein's. Ariel was very helpful when I called to make the reservation. When we got there, they wouldn't seat us until more than half of our party had arrived. Once we finally sat the service was just really bad. It took forever for anyone to come and greet us and take our drink orders. When they did I ordered a pitcher of sangria that was on the drink menu and the waiter told me that they don't do pitchers. I told him it was on the menu but if they stopped making pitchers then we would just have 2 glasses. He said he'd have to check on that. He had only taken half of the table's drink orders and rather than take the rest he left to figure out about the sangria situation. He finally came back and said they don't make sangria anymore, ok fine. So we ordered the Berry Fresh specialty cocktails and those were actually quite good. They put out popcorn which is a nice touch and tasted very good but it was only 2 small bowls for our group of 12 and they never refilled or asked if we wanted more. Most of us ended up ordering burgers, mine was a turkey burger and it was ok, nothing special although the fries were good. No one ever checked to make sure we were happy with our food. After eating we just payed our bill right away and left. We actually went and had a drink at the bar right outside of Holstein's before heading to Marquee, maybe we would have stayed for another drink there but we all just wanted to leave. Honestly the food was decent and I would maybe consider giving them another try to check out the spiked milkshakes which looked very good, but the service really made our impression of Holstein's pretty negative so I'm not sure if I'll be back. I would rather go to Bachi Burger.",

I definitely, agree because I definitely scarfed down the burger. The cheese they used with the bacon and the arugula and their aioli. It was perfect together, nothing was too overpowering, which was nice.  I would definitely come back here again to try out a different burger. I thought their prices were on the higher end but I guess you're in Vegas, so nothing you can do about that.",

We tried the primary recommendations like the Lobster Mac n Cheese, as well as the Rising Sun and Gold Standard burgers, all of which were barely above mediocre.  The S'mores Shake was also just a glamorized DQ blizzard.  Starting to realize all of the best Vegas eating is off the strip (not surprising).",

We tried the quesadillas, sliders, fries and one of the recommended appetizers. Consistently blah.  Pretty disappointed since they place looks very cool. So many choices in this town, the only way this place survives is because they get so many first timers.",

We said no, we'd rather just wait for our table and asked if we could sit anywhere to wait. Hostess said yes. We sat at the bar, where a waitress came by to ask for our order, we said we were just waiting for our table. She promptly informed us that these seats were only got ppl eating, so we had to move. So humph, after another 15 min, we asked the hostess how much longer for our table and she looked confused.  Then after a brief convo on her headphone, said sorry, I thought someone else already sat you guys but we gave your table to another group.  Ugh. By the time we were seated, and got our food. I had the gold standard--the blue cheese was smeared on and did not blend well with the overall taste. Another person had their billionaire burger ($28).  For a $28 burger, the meat should be more juicy and flavorful instead of dry. The piece if foie gras included was cheap and rubbery.  Overall....food was not good and Wayyy overpriced.  Combined with rude and negligent service---we will not be returning!!",

You can get a comparable burger elsewhere for much cheaper, like stripburger.  It's so loud inside I could barely hear my date and he was sitting right across from me.

The kobe burger I had was really decent but not great. There was almost none of the 1000 island dressing the menu mentioned on the burger. Fries are pretty good as well. Of the 5 of us, most of us thought it was solid one thought it was great and one did not care for their sandwich.

For the table we ordered Kalbi Beef and Kimchee Quesadilla, Philly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls and Truffle Lobster Mac N Cheese.  The were all incredibly good.  I had to hold back from eating every last bite on each plate to save room for dinner.  I had the Chicken Caesar Salad which had good size pieces of chicken and a nice little touch of sunflower seeds which was a nice change of pace from your typical Caesar.  My friends ordered the Cobb Salad which looked fantastic and another had a salmon burger which she loved.  Beware of the shoe string fries... they are so good that I had to push the bucket away to stop myself from eating them all.  You MUST try their milkshakes.  They are amazing!  Overall I would absolutely come back to this restaurant.  There are so many things on the menu that I would like to try not to mention their alcoholic shakes!",

My only complaint about the whole meal was that I ordered a nice Orval beer to go with the burger and it was served cold as if it was  Bud Light or something.  Orval should never be served that cold!   After cupping my hands around the glass for a while it warmed up to a better temperature and the flavor came out as it should.  We'll be back!",

Food: 4, atmosphere: 4, service: 2 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (my burger with additions was almost $20) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Steakhouse burger: loved the pepper-crusted patty as it was no joke--you could see the full peppercorns. The onions were sweet and really good. I added an egg which was cooked perfectly so it ran to create it's own sauce from its yolk. Only con was the bun wasn't anything special or worth it. - Bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos: spicy! Liked the crispy bacon. There was cheese inside but not too much which my partially Asian stomach appreciated. - Fried pickle spears: had the bumpy kind of breading which I liked - Milkshakes: my friends loved these fun combos like smores or banana peanut butter cup (drunken monkey). See above comment for why I couldn't enjoy one, but I would've loved to. They do have fun vodka flavors on hand to make these like chocolate coconut which I do want to try. - Fried bacon: never seen this outside of a county fair, but was pretty good in a smooth crispy batter - Longhorn burger: the hub got this with BBQ brisket on the burger which seems crazy, but as a meat lover pizza type, he liked it - Sweet potato fries: crispy and the right level of sweetness. I couldn't stop eating them. - Decor: liked the fun art on the walls with toki doki-like characters  Midlights: - Philly cheese steak egg roll: they looked like the Jack in the Box ones--which I love by the way--but with a tough exterior  that didn't work for me  Lowlights:  - Service: our waiter had a fun personality but the service was nonexistent.   Had a fun lunch here--I'd come back and hope for better service.",

    "text": "Reminiscing about my childhood memories is like the anticipation of a first kiss; it's (usually) messy, exciting, and puts a smile on a face. That is how Holsteins shakes made me feel, and their grown up version added a tinge of a twist to remind me that I am not 5 anymore, and I am okay with that.  Holsteins is known for their milkshakes so I was curious to know if they met up to that prominent expectation. We sat at the bar and were greeted instantly; it was nice that the bartender gave us his full attention even though we were only looking for a taste of a milkshake. I'm not an ice cream or milkshake devotee, but I was taken away by the intriguing menu of unusual paired milkshakes, such as the Frozen Grasshopper (Peppermint, Chocolate, Creme De Menthe, Pinnacle Chocolate Vodka), Cereal Bowl (3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch), Red Velvet Cake Shake (Zing Red Velvet Vodka, Red Velvet Cake, Cream Cheese Mousse, Mini Whoopee Pie), and even an all year around Pumpkin Pie (Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, Pepitas Brittle) shake! Although I was hesitant at first at the idea of an alcohol infused milkshake, they prepare virgin ones as well. I stay far away from hard liquor unless the social gathering is right, and this night was one of them. The bartender assured me that I would hardly taste the alcohol anyway, is this a good sign?   C E R E A L  B O W L  [ $ 13 ] We decided on the Cereal Bowl; 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Fruit Loops, Cap'N Crunch in a vanilla ice cream base, yum! This milky concoction masked the alcohol so well that I didn't taste anything but the abundance of one of my childhood favourite cereals, Cap'N Crunch! So light yet sweet with a just-right cereal texture, this treat was more than the best milkshake I've ever tasted.  I certainly see myself visiting Holsteins again, perhaps to try the Red Velvet Cake Shake or the Moscow Moo; it's difficult to say no when these milkshakes are completely inspired by cake ingredients to childhood inspired creations x",

Don't be afraid of not being able to order one of their specialty shakes for your little one either because they can make everything virgin. I ordered a virgin nutella crunch shake and had enough left over to take back with me to our room. My boyfriend ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a shake as well. Everything was delicious, it's definitely a spot worth visiting again.",

    "text": "With the caveat that I didn't have a burger the two times I was here (but tried a number of apps and shakes), this place is typical for an eatery at a big Vegas hotel - adequate, never a bad meal, but you will never be blown away in any fashion (my humble person opinion - every meal in Vegas at a high end hotel is basically just a facsimile of the better version you can get at the restaurant's SoCal or NY location).  I came here twice on a recent bachelor party.  Once for milkshakes, and once for apps before our flight home.  The (boozy) milkshakes were very good.  I had the \"Fat Boy\" (UV Candy Bar Vodka, Reese's, Pretzels, Sprinkles, Chocolate-Caramel Popcorn).  A friend had the Vegan Maple Pecan shake (Almond Milk 'ice Cream', Jack Daniel's, Spiced Pecans, Maple Caramel Sauce).  Both were delicious, although if you are really in the mood for something sweet and creamy, the vegan shake probably won't hit the spot (the sort of \"earthy\" taste of the maple and almonds doesn't give you the same satisfaction as real ice cream).  The booze was barely detectable, however (I would've liked at least just a little taste, to know I was drinking something alcoholic).  The next day we came back for onion rings, chicken fingers, buffalo chicken dip, and surf and turf quesadillas.  I had a bloody Mary, which was good, but after three days of drinking, the shrimp on top was NOT appetizing.  The apps were all meh - not bad, but not great.  I was expecting something more from the \"Southern fried\" chicken fingers, but they basically tasted like something I could get from Roy Rogers.  Dip was good, but again, didn't really taste fresh made or have that \"pop\" I was expecting when I read the menu description.  We sat in the front every time we came here, so I can't comment on the rear seating area, but I will say this - there is incredibly loud music with a heavy bass beat that is just not palatable.    All told, try the shakes.  Maybe try the burgers (can't comment directly, but I wouldn't be optimistic based on the other food).  Apps are basically TGI Friday's quality.",

None the less, the two burgers I have had here has been uber yommy.  The bun is super soft. Got to be steamed.  Medium-well came out with a slight pink tinge. Which it never does when I order medium well.  I order the burger to go knowing I had 20 mins to get to the airport. I gnaw on my nails nervously as 15 mins ticked by. The female bartender checked once and said it will be out in a minute. When 5 mins ticked by, she sent another bartender back to the kitchen and he came out with my burger. Hurrah for nice service",

This place has some awesome burgers and shakes. They are a bit pricey though. The shakes are good tasting and a bit creative, although at $11 dollars, are a bit on the expensive side.   Had the drunken money ( Reeses pieces and bananas), and the cereal bowl (vanilla with pieces of cereal)   The burgers are very tender, and although I only had the \"Rising sun\" (kobe beef, with spices and avocado) ($16.5), the other burgers looked very good too.  Very good food at a higher price, but if you're in Las Vegas everything is going to cost more!",

I was leaving the Cosmopolitan after the Black Keys show, hungry and bitter that both Jaleo and China Poblano had stopped serving food.  Suddenly, a friend texted me from HSB saying they had vegan options!  I traversed the mob of drunken concert-goers and arrived poste haste, just in time to put in the last to-go order of the night!  The main vegan options are the Urth burger sliders (2 for $8, comes with delicious homemade-tasting potato chips) or the proper full-sized Urth burger ($13, comes with a side of fries).  I went for the sliders, since I  have not had a slider since I was knee-high to a grasshopper back in TN eating at Krystal's.    Verdict - Fries were awesome, chips were awesome, Urth burger was so-so.  It was a mix of veggies, and maybe chickpea flour? It had a falafel-ish character to it.  It was nicely fried on the outside, but pretty mushy.  It came topped with avocado, cucumber and sprouts (see pic) on a fluffy bun that was not egg-washed.  It's nothing that I'd go running back for, but it's a solid option for late-night eating when your carnivore friends insist on burgers.",

I ordered the burger togo and came back around 40 minutes to pick it up. I love the fact that they didn't cover the togo box and actually left it open in the bag (2 thumbs up).   My review is based on eating the burger a couple hours later after going to Light. I previously read my friends reviews and wasn't sure i would like it since I didn't want to heat up the burger. Honestly speaking... the burger was freaking delicious. I could clearly taste the bacon, goat cheese, arugula and garlic aioli sauce. It was seriously mind boggling that it still tasted really good. I know its not really fair that i had it several hours after i got the burger but I don't know that i can even say the same for other burger that are fresh. I will definitely be back here to try the gold standard fresh and other burgers as well.",

We thought we were geniuses. Til we tried it. And it was not good.  BUT...Holstein's has somehow managed to change that. If you're at the Cosmo or near the Cosmo, it'll be worth your while to try a \"bamboozled shake.\" After being heavily advertised to go here by Thia G, I forced my friends walking around the strip with me during the day to come get a shake with me. The wait was rather long for them to make it, but take pictures of the spotted pink cow while you're waiting!  Ordered a Frozen Grasshopper because I LOVE MINT. It came with a cute light green peppermint meringue on top and sprinkled mini chocolate malt balls. Alcohol content was creme de menthe and van gogh dutch chocolate vodka.   BEST. MILKSHAKE. I'VE. EVER. HAD. Period. And I mean, at $11 a pop, it had better be damn good. But it was! I couldn't taste the alcohol at all, although I felt the effects later, but shoot, I'll be damned if I ever had such a delicious milkshake before in my life. I may just be biased because it was mint flavored and I have an obsession with mint, but I'm pretty sure everyone else with me agreed that it wasn't just me.   Try it! I can't wait to go back to Vegas and try another flavor! =) 5 stars for their bamboozled shakes! And thanks Thia G. for the suggestion!",

We had a party of 8 during Friday night at around 10 p.m., and ended up splitting into two tables of 4 because it was packed. The two musts here are their burgers and shakes. The BF and I split the fun-ghi burger, which was really good. I also had a bite of the Rising Sun which was great as well (think burger with an Asian twist). Their patty is really juicy and most importantly, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Since we were sharing the burger, we decided to get the truffled mac n cheese with lobster, which was piping hot and delicious. I wasn't sure about the lone potato chip on the side though.  We ordered a couple of milkshakes: Brown Cow Float, Oreo, Drunken Monkey, and Campfire Smores. My favorite was the Oreo. The Brown Cow had chocolate pop rocks which made it very unique. It's pricey at ~$11 but they do give you a cup and a half, which makes it feel like a little better deal.   Holsteins ranks right under Father's Office in LA in my book.",

All of this together provided an awesome dining experience. I definitely wanted to give a shout out to the wait staff. Being on a business trip we had a budget to stick with so we had three separate checks with both credit and cash transactions. When we told the waiter we were met with \"No problem\". I definitely appreciated that! Food- The burger patty you could tell was very fresh. I think I heard a \"Moo\" from the kitchen! Excellent meat to bun ratio. Probably 6+ ounces or better. They really have a nice variety of topping to please everyone. The fries were very good as well. I really liked that all the shakes listed on the menu you could order with or without the booze. We opted without to capture the True flavor and they did not disappoint.  Overall I thought for the location and the setting the price point was spot on. I think I paid right around $20 bucks for the burger and fries. My brother added the shake so it came to around $27. If I were staying at the Cosmo I would more than likely return again, but with so many burger choices around Vegas most likely I will move on to sample other spots as well. Highly recommended and worth the trip to check them out!",

Also, the burgers were delicious and surprisingly not too oily compared to other gourmet burgers. The one thing you have to try is the onion rings. I hate when onions are too large in onion rings, but Holsteins does it right with the thin onion strips and delicious breading.  My only complaint is the wait time. The first time we went, they told us it was a 30-40 minute wait for our food no matter what we ordered. Food NEVER takes that long to come out even in a steakhouse. We got lucky the second time we went because the waiter told us it was a 30-40 minute wait, noticed we were in a rush, and ended up pulling strings and got our food out in 10 minutes, so kudos to service!",

    "text": "While the rest of our friends were getting ready to go clubbing later that night, a couple of my buddies and I decided to grab some burgers before going bar hopping around Fremont Street.  I originally wanted to check out Holstein's after seeing them on our last Vegas trip, but there wasn't an opportunity to go since we had already planned out the rest of our meals.  After I read Yelp friend Cat C.'s review though, I told my friends it was a must for our next trip!  Although some Yelpers have complained about how long the wait was for a table, we didn't run into the same problem.  Luck must have been on our side because not only did it take just a few minutes until we were seated, but we also got a server (Jennifer?) who was both awesome and way cute.  Double win!  A bunch of the burgers on the menu sounded pretty appealing (especially The Rising Sun, The Steakhouse, and Korean \"Bull\"gogi), but somehow the three of us managed to order the exact same thing - the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin with Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula, and Garlic Chive Aioli) (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=vErdAOwPAfm6PP_uFDmjEQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>).  The patty was cooked perfectly - just a touch of pink on the inside, juicy, and a light char on the outside.  Adding in the smoked bacon just made it that much better (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=t6cDviH3qCnh95L9pnFaVA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>).  While all of the condiments worked really well together, I have to admit all that aged goat cheddar got to be a bit much.  Not bad for the first half of the burger, but I was reminded during the last half why I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese.  We all agreed though that the biggest knock was the bun - a bit dry and pretty plain.  Just making it smaller and less airy would have gone a long way.  All things considered, the prices for their burgers aren't unreasonable.  At about $13-$18 each, you actually get your money's worth for the most part (unlike China Poblano next door...).  Whichever one you get though, I'd suggest choosing the shoestring fries to go with it (they're more like regular cut fries than \"shoestring\").  While the tin of steak fries that came with my order were fine, I thought the shoestring fries my friend had were crispier and a little more flavorful.  Now I just have to go back and try one of Holstein's shakes - preferably of the alcoholic variety.",

    "text": "I've heard about Holstein's via reviews on social media for about the past year, and finally tried the place with a friend last night.  The environment, food & service was good, but I do not understand what the buzz & rave reviews are about!  We arrived at about 9PM on a Wednesday & were promptly seated in the restaurant section (we could have sat in the bar or lounge area, but both were a little too noisy for us).      I ordered a chocolate milkshake ($9) the \"Urth\" burger ($13) plus cheddar cheese ($2), mushrooms ($2) & grilled onions ($2) and for an extra $2 I could upgrade from fries to onion rings, so I did that as well.  My friend ordered the Executive burger, cooked medium, and a water.  Service was good -- not great, not bad, but OK/good.  Ambiance -- casual attire by both guests as well as waitstaff, a little artsy architecture, numerous TVs on the walls.  Nothing pretentious, nor elegant.  Food -- My $9 chocolate shake didn't taste any different than a McDonalds chocolate shake, other than that it came with some whipped cream on the top (sorry, no cherry) & a little extra in a metal cup, old-school style. My burger was great, but $19 great? Absolutely not.  I could have loaded-up at 5 Guys or In & Out burger and been just as happy with my burger, for a lot less $.   As for the onion rings, they were good, but not great, and on-par with a fresh order of onion rings you might get from Burger King!  My friend said his burger was good (not great...) despite it clearly being medium-rare, not the medium he ordered.  Total bill came to $50, + $10 tip = $60 for two, no alcohol & my friend just drinking water.  I realize Holstein's is in the Cosmopolitan & probably pays a lot of rent, but to the customer, that fact alone shouldn't justify the high prices -- better quality, better service, better interior design are needed there.  Am I glad I finally got around to trying Holstein's?  Sure!  Will I go back? Only if friends want to try it, but I'll try steering them elsewhere first.   We will certainly wander around the Cosmo and be awed by the high-class, sometimes ostentatious scenery, but if we're not on some sort of expense account, we'll go elsewhere for dinner.   Prices are the same or slightly higher at BurGR in Planet Hollywood but the service, atmosphere, & quality (such as the house-made buns & ketchup) are much better.",

    "text": "Talk about a 2,000 calorie meal and milkshakes for alcoholics! I was in Vegas for a convention and my co-worker mentioned to try Holsteins which is located at The Cosmopolitan. We decided to try it out for lunch since we were staying close by at Vdara.  I've been on a moderate diet cutting out the regular bad foods on a daily basis but since I was in town, I decided to fudgeittt! It's been 6 months since I've had a burger and fries.  Their menu is full of gourmet burgers which reminded me of Umami but a bit more on the high end with dry aged beef, kobe, and lamb.  I was tempted to try the Gold Standard which was supposedly voted best burger in Vegas, but instead, I opted for \"The Rising Sun\". It consist of kobe beef with nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and a tempura avocado.  Enjoyed every bite of this burger. I had to smash the tempura avocado since it's a quarter of a whole avocado. Burger had great flavor. I wish I could have two.  Burger came with shoestring fries or steakcut fries. I chose the steak cut fries and was a bit disappointed. It was cut in wedges and had a light coating of flour.  Didn't care for it. I was really hoping for thick cut fries with lots of ketchup and a dash of tabasco.  I was tempted to try their bam boozed shakes which are concoctions of different shakes paired with liquors. It would be too heavy for lunch so I opted not to. Plus, I had an 11 course dinner the prior night.   I enjoyed this place and look forward to coming back. Menu is above average prices, however, worth it being unique and of better quality. Wish they'd open a place like this in LA. Imagine getting buzzed off a milk shake or two combined with brain freeze!!",

Honestly wasn't planning on it but some friends from Las Vegas wanted to meet up here.  First Impression....Ambiance, music, decor were all spectacularly modern. Place seemed like the spot to be for a Friday night bite. We were seated immediately (arrived at 7ish). The beer list is top notch and that is a huge deal for me when I am getting the evening started. Took us a while to all decide on what we should eat. Seemed like the server got a bit frustrated with our inability to make decisions.  I went with the GOLD STANDARD, based on the servers recommendation. I have never had a dry aged burger, but boy am I craving one now holy smokes. Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli....I usually like to dry dog my meat....not one for lubrication as far as condiments and such go. But they did a fantastic job focusing on not slopping up such a delightful cut... er uh grind of beef. Pretty close to the best burger I have ever sunk my teeth into. Didnt even get around to polishing off the sweet potato fries....first ones I have ever had that were actually crispy...I understand how dificult it is to crispify a sweet potato fry.  Server really pushed the spiked shakes...but I was so full....he said \"Dude I can put it in a to-go cup for you\"....I caved into the Raspberry Cheesecake Shake it was damn good....even after a night in the freezer...Vodka shake is good for breakfast boys and girls.  ****Server Cheesed it up by fist bumping me***** thought that was kinda lame but whatever  EAT  AT THIS PLACE WHEN GOING ON A BENDER IN LAS VEGAS!",

I get it, arugula is fancy, it's not worth a $15 burger though. Service was terrible, waited about 20 minutes for a table, being the first party on a non-existent, no-names last. Then, hostess: \"oh, someone just took that table that opened up. Sorry!\" ... wait, what exactly is your job here? Anyhow... sat at the bar due to hungry, takes forever to get anything ordered, and bartender literally stops attending to respond to someone else's commentary on something or other. Worthless service.  I dunno. I mean. Burgers people. Not $20, not $30. You'll probably spend like $50 for 2 burgers and a beer. I can't do it. I'm in the wrong city. But, In-and-Out is down the street! Under $10 for two to eat, and way better service than Holsteins. Fail.  Good food though.  Thanks for listening!",

My hubby and I needed a little downtime before starting our night so we got a couple of milkshakes to go and enjoyed them up in our room.  Mine was the one with bananas and Frangelico in it.  So delicious!  You could taste the flavor of the liquor but it was not too strong.  The hubby got the Oreo one which I think had Bailey's in it.  His must have been stronger than mine since he totally passed out shortly after.  But that more likely was due to the fact that we had been at a kids birthday party all day.",

    "text": "Great burger joint inside the Cosmo! Nice decor and atmosphere. Our table was wobbly, so being a designer in for the Hospitality Expo, I was a little po'd at this since everything else in this hotel is exquisitely designed. But, won't knock off points for that.  The food: ordered the \"Nom nom\" burger...Kobe beef burger with cheese. It didn't come with lettuce, tomatoes, etc., but they're available for the asking. Overall, very good...not as melt-in-your-mouth as the kobe burger at one of Wolfgang Puck's restuarants, but tasty none the less. Got it with steak fries...again, good, but about the same as what you could get at say Fuddruckers or KFC; nothing special, but still good.  Service: Good. We could tell our server was either tired or just tired of working in Vegas, but at least she still made an effort to smile. Another server who accidentally poured water into my 1/2 empty Sprite glass was better and more fun. We all laughed, she realized her \"super fail\" (as she exclaimed), apologized and provided me with extra soda and popcorn...which had me thinking, \"why didn't our main server give us popcorn when we first sat down??\"  Again, neither here nor there.  For the guys(& maybe some of you ladies): the servers in the bar area...wow. Very hot asian ladies in tight red mini-dresses?! Take that, Hooters!  Overall, a nice casual place to eat amongst the swankier places in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely better than some of the other burger offerings in Vegas. Guys, if your girl doesn't wanna leave \"The Chandelier\" bar, just go up and have a burger & watch the game at Holsteins! You're welcome.",

The beer selection was decent with the exception that the server had to come back on 3 separate beer orders to tell me they were out of each of the 3 different beers. Now, you would think that when he discovered they were out of one beer, he would have checked to see which others might not be available. Nope.  If you are looking for an evening of great beers with great food, I highly suggest you check out Public House. Sure, the price is slightly higher, but the experience more than makes up for it.",

    "text": "Not like this place needs my rating, but it was amazing! I was in Vegas all last week, because my wife had a work offsite, so I got to tag along to watch our infant daughter. The whole week I was eating burgers, I honestly did not want to eat another burger, but I guess I would have to try this place because it came highly recommended by a friend of ours.  My sister and I decided to go for lunch. As I said, I have been eating burgers all week, so I decided to get a turkey burger. I am a little picky when It comes to what goes in my burger, but 1. I was starving and 2. i would trust fancy burger places like this.  We were seated immediately and I noticed that they served spiked shakes, I don't drink, but it was nice to see a place that offered such a variety of shakes. We decided to get the bulgogi quesadillas. They were very good, very authentic tasting bulgogi, the sesame sauce was great, just wish there was a little more. Also, I do like a spicy kimchi, the kimchi that topped it was not very spicy.  I get the turkey burger with fries. The turkey was very juicy and not dry. It was full of flavor without being over powering. The Russian dressing complemented the burger perfectly, buns were soft but not too soft. it was a very messy burger, I had to split it in half just so everything didn't fall out.  Overall I would say it was a good experience. Great atmosphere, great service and a great burger. When I return to Las Vegas, I would love to go there first and try their other burgers. I had my eye on the Billionaire burger.",

When he first came to greet us he simply introduced himself and said he would be back with some water - it annoys me when you are barely sat down when the server asks if there is anything to get started...uh, yeah, some time to look at the menu perhaps. For burgers they offer tiny buns (sliders) and big buns (a much more substantial burger). The burger is quite large - I would probably order the slider style on a return visit - keep your hunger level in mind when ordering. The burger itself (Memphis Burger)was very tasty and prepared perfectly. The fries were also perfectly prepared and they do give you a pretty large quantity. I did not try one of their \"adult\" shakes The atmosphere is open and modern with plenty of tv's around if you want to watch a game.",

The menu has some really good looking things on it, but everything is pretty damn expensive.  I went with the gold standard burger and a side of onion rings.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was really juicy and rich and had great flavor. All of the accompaniments worked well together, but worth 17.50? Not sure about that, then again it is Vegas.  The onion rings were also pretty damn good. Nice batter and seasoning with a great crunch to them. Would get them again..  Overall I was pretty pleased with Holsteins. Nothing was amazing or lifechanging, but a pretty great spot for burgers and shakes although you are going to be spending some $$$",

    "text": "Food - AMAZING Service - superb Decor - comfortable & inviting  The lobster macaroni and cheese may have been the best thing I've ever eaten in Vegas. It came with a mini lobster roll (not mentioned on the menu) and included a slice of bacon. When I told our server I wasn't expecting that and that I don't eat bacon, they brought me another mini sandwich sans bacon. While we're on the service, Porsha was awesome. She offered to split all our checks before and kept everyone's tabs in order. Smiled the whole time and was super friendly about recommendations.  The Frozen Grasshopper was like drinking the last of your Thrifty's mint chip ice cream. It was a tasty shake, but maybe not worth $11, $7 or $8 at best even with the Frangelico in there.   I also had the sliders, two tasty lil bundles of joy. The only knock on this place is on the homemade potato chips that came with them. I must have got some from hours ago because they were cold and rubbery. I bet a fresh & crispy batch would be very good there and would be great with any burger.  Next time I'm in Vegas, Holsteins is at the top of my dining list.",

Don't bother with their veggie \"Urth\" Burger; it was unseasoned, and lacked flavor. The Chicken Club Burger wasn't bad, but the onion rings were even better. The Rising Sun was delicious, but messy to eat. So, should you try now? If it's late and you're in the area, yes.",

Was there about 5 minutes just long enough to be helped and brought my beer, only to have a server sent over by the manager who asked \"are you going to stand here long?\". I looked at her puzzled saying I was just ordering a beer while we waited, and she replied (pointing at the table behind me) that they had paid $200 to sit there and I was blocking their view.  I was shocked and explained I was just ordering a beer from the bar, (you know, like people do at a bar) before she went on about that table being upset and they needed me to move.  I was flabbergasted. I told her that this was incredibly rude, that I had only been standing there long enough to order the beer, but since my business was apparently unwanted, that I would not be eating there at all now. I looked over at the table in question, which was had incredibly snobby looking patrons sitting, who would not even look at me.  I went to the front of house, talked to the manager. I found he was the one who sent that server over to ask me to move! He did say he sent her over to talk to me, but apologized about the way it was handled. He seemed sincere, but I dont know how you can ask staff to do something like that.  Terrible service, never got to taste the food. Wont be back.",

Only if I wanted a beer.  Beer: 5/5. Great selection. Items on draft that you don't see elsewhere.   Milkshakes: 3.5/5. More wow factor than taste. Being doubles for only $3 is a nice deal, but only if you like that boozy taste.   Food: 3/5. Burgers very tasty, though they are al-a-cart. Biggest complaint was even though we all order our burger the same, medium rare; one was grey and tough, one was medium and one was bloody squishy. However, since it took over an hour to get our burgers it wasn't like we were going to send it back cause we were so hungry.  Service: 1/5: Waiter was amazing and apologized many times for our food taking forever. Many people sat and ate by us before our food ever came. Never experienced anything like it because usually in this case at least you get a discount but no discount here. Place definitely doesn't care about there patrons because it's Vegas and it's not like they are going to be back.",

Not only was the shake delicious, but the candy corn attached with frosting and the miniature slice of pumpkin pie on top were delicious as well.  The Poutine + Fried Egg was pretty good. It was a jazzed up version of regular poutine with short rib. The combination was good, but became quite salty as I enjoyed more bites. Everyone else at the table had burgers and reported that they were really good burgers. The juicy burgers did create soggy buns almost immediately.",

The drunken money was okay... it was half shake (liqueur was very strong and you can taste it)  and half whipped cream.. not happy about that. But it was worth the try! We ordered the Mac daddy which was freaking bomb! It had like tomatoes and bacon, talk about flavor! Now the burgers.. steak house was amazing but a little messy. Nom nom burger was soooo juicy...  I ordered medium but it came out medium well.. oh well. Had potato chips in it which was interesting but the flavors combined so perfectly. For the price, I wish these burgers came with fries.

The best burger in Vegas! We had been looking at a lot of places to try and find the best burger in Vegas, and we found it in Holsteins. I got The Classic, it was cooked right, came with good toppings, and filled me up. The service was good, but more notably, the venue was different and cool.

They start you off with a small bucket of pizza flavored popcorn and things only get even better from there. Hubby and I worked together for the whole meal, ordering different entrees and deserts so we could share.   He got a burger that was covered in teriyaki sauce, little fried haystack sweet potatoes and a tempura avocado. The main flavor here was definitely the teriyaki. The sweet potatoes gave a nice crunch and the avocado provided a smooth, creamy texture.   I ordered the current burger special - a Thanksgiving burger. It had a turkey patty, a patty of stuffing and was topped with cranberry sauce. The salty from the stuffing and sweet/Tart from the cranberries complimented each other very nicely.   For dessert, hubby got the cookies and cream shake. It was an Oreo shake topped with a cookie ice cream sandwich and the glass was rolled in cookie crumbs. The ice cream sandwich was decent - nothing life changing, but certainly yummy. The Shake was actually very well done, and this Is coming from someone who's pretty picky. It had a good amount of sweetness and was very creamy. I loved the cookie crumbs on the glass. They were stuck on using a thick, white icing that stupid sweet and delicious.   I went for the Peanut Butter Crunch Brownie. Although it's much smaller than their epic shakes, this little thing really packs a punch! It had layers of dense brownie, chewy caramel and peanuts. This is definitely what I go for when it comes to dessert and I would absolutely order it again!  This place was fantastically fun and we will absolutely return!",

    "text": "We stopped into Holsteins specifically to try their \"boozy\" shakes. All of their shakes sounded amazing so deciding on just one was not easy.  The wife and I finally agreed on their drunken monkey. As far as shakes go it was delicious, beautiful, and a lot of fun to eat/drink. I would certainly return to try their other shakes.         Now for some friendly advice to potential customers. The shakes are expensive, and \"boozy\" they are not. We were hoping for a closer reflection of the ice cream drinks commonly found in Key West that combined Great flavor with grain alcohols. Which made the prices seem more reasonable and gave the drinks more of a purpose. When you add a shot of hazelnut liqueur to a huge milk shake. Calling it \"boozy\" is very misrepresentative.  I'm sure we would have been able to add more alcohol that would have shot the price of our milkshake well above $20.            Sorry for the mixed review, lol. My intentions weren't to confuse you. I think this place is absolutely worth trying. Their food looked and sounded amazing, I simply meant to give people a heads up.",

Both were delicious but between the two if I had to pick I'd go El Caliente for the second time. We got both types of fries (regular and sweet potato). I'm a huge sweet potato fan, so I thought those were the best. We also split among the entire table because we wanted to try it - the truffle lobster Mac and cheese. The lobster chunks were legit! I've eaten at Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay which is a totally different experience since it's basically build your own - I lean more towards heading back to Holsteins \"if\" I had to make the final decision.",

    "text": "My friend raved about Holsteins so I knew I had to try it when I returned to Vegas, & I did indeed!    The decor doesn't seem to fit the upscale flashy decor of Cosmo but it's not ugly or anything & is definitely more casual.  Anywhoo, after much deliberation with their attractive menu, I finally decided on the Rising Sun burger ($16.50) with the shoestring fries.  The Rising Sun is a big kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, crispy yam strings, spicy mayo & nori furikake.  He chose the Gold Standard ($17.50) which is dry-aged sirlion with crispy bacon, tomato confit, baby arugla, garlic chive aoli & goat cheese (he substitued swiss though).  The prices are up there, but it's in the plush Cosmo & at least they came with fries (which some burgers at First Food & Bar at Palazzo don't for around the same price).  He chose the seasoned steak fries.    Next time I'm going to go for their thick seasoned steak fries!  While shoestring is always good because their so crispy, these fries were still crispy on the edges & seasoned so well!  Everything worked so well with my burger!  Loved the tempura avocado & the sauces worked well & wasn't really messy.  The mayo wasn't spicy but maybe that's a good thing so it wouldn't overpower the burger.  The only thing I didn't like & this is always a pet peeve of mine..is the temperature was off!  I requested medium & it was at least medium well.  It wasn't really dried out but I wanted some juice!  I had a nibble of his burger too & it was pretty damn good, but I loved my Asian inspired burger lots more!  I was so stuffed at these massive burgers & the fries that I couldn't finish & had to leave some fries behind & give him the last few nibbles of my burger.    Their appetizers look appealing too, but my tummy can't handle all that food.  I can't wait to come back to Holsteins during my next Vegas trip & hopefully next time my burger will be a perfect medium!",

Although Marquee is right next door, there's a Dj that rocks out so you can decide when to move the party to the dance floor -- no rush.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I'm lactose intolerant and allergic to coconut milk -- they didn't have any desserts I could eat. Other than that, highly recommended!",

After a lucky streak at the craps table, I felt like a billionaire so I figured YOLO, let's get a $28 \"billionaire burger!\"  I ended up splitting this with my buddy and also sharing the \"gols standard\" with the dry aged beef and goat cheese.  I msut say, they were both delicious but very very different: Billionaire:  The patty itself was made from Kobe and foie gras, then it was topped of with a seared slab of foie.  Taking a bite into it is sensory richness overload, effin delicious!  I immediately grabbed the Stella and washed it down and it was just heaven.  But pretty much, all yo get form this burger is the richness of fat.  I am glad I split it because I would not feel good after eating this one alone.  Great burger, would be willing to split it again with someone. Gold Standard:  Now this is a burgerthat I thought had great balance and flavor.  The patty was delicious, definitely a great pronounced beef flavor.  The goat cheese and tomato confit was absolutely perfect in the burger.  This is a burger I would order again and eat on my own.  Their fries, onion rings and wings are nothing to rave about.  They have a great beer selection, and the service we got was spot on excellent.  This is one of the only reasons I would ever come back to the Cosmo (hotel sucks).",

Maybe the burger fad has wore off on me, but it was just ok. $15 for a plain burger, it should have been awesome, to me and my guest it had a odd, kind of funny taste. Like it was old.   It looked great on the plate, burger was nice and thick, wasn't dry, condiments seemed fresh.  My guest really like the onion rings, but I found they had too much bread.   Crunchy and crisp, but the onion to bread ratio was off.  For only an extra $2, for the rings, that's not bad. There shakes are always good.  To me a burger bar is about that piece of meat, the stuff on top should compliment it. It's all about burger, which tasted bad. Sorry Holsteins, I love your location, decor and service. You just have to fix what's between the bun.",

I ordered their Rising Sun burger, which  contained a kobe beef patty in teriyaki glaze topped with furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. I thought the burger was overcooked, which ruined the texture of the kobe beef patty.  The spicy mayo was ok and not spicy so if you're not into spicy food you'll do fine with this burger.  I thought the tempura avocado was interesting.  The avocado was nice and soft with a nice crisp tempura coating.  It's a good burger but I don't think it was worth $16.50.  I probably would try a different burger if I dine here again.",

    "text": "After seeing the place on the Food Network,we decided it was someplace we wanted to visit while we were in Vegas.    Made a reservation on Open Table while at the MGM for a show, and took a stroll down the strip and made it in plenty of time before our reservation. Situated in the Cosmo it's pretty easy to find if you just follow your nose.   They were happy to seat us early even though it was a little busy.    The menu is a bit to take in as there is so much that looks so good... how do you decide.  I opted for the Holstein Beef sliders and my companion went for something a little more spicy the El Caliente.    My sliders were really good.  Not over cooked, and a great size for the buns they were served on.  And as everyone else has stated, the homemade ketchup ROCKED!    I'm not really into the spicy stuff, but I did have a small taste and it was pretty good.  I could also tell by the lack of conversation and the amount of time it took him to eat it.. was later reported to be very good and a decent size for a large appetite.   I was able to snake a few of his fries and could really only finish 2 of the 3 sliders so they worked out well.    it's always fun to explore new places when you are out of town.  Stop in and explore this place for sure.",

I'd probably get them again if i end up stayin in cosmo. The bartender was really nice but rushed me to close out my bill. boo.",

    "text": "I continue to be mesmerized by the non-burger items and underwhelmed by the service and prices.  On my latest visit, there was a group of 8 of us for lunch. They didn't take reservations and wouldn't seat us until everyone in the party had arrived. (Which, ok, I suppose those things are understandable.) Our table was \"ready\" before everyone in the party had arrived and they said they could hold it for 5 more minutes. I said that was fine, they should be here any minute, and to please let me know before they gave our table away (I was sitting at the bar close to the hostess stand and they had my cell phone number). Well, of course, the rest of the party arrives and I'm informed that they gave our table away and I have to put my name back on the wait list. Needless to say, I was pretty pissed - especially as it had been exactly 5 minutes and they agreed to let me know before giving away the table. After some squabbling, we finally got a table without having to re-wait.  I was looking forward to having the Sonoran dogs again, but alas, those were no longer on the menu. Therefore, I opted for the Chicago dogs. They were ok, but not that great and so not worth the money. 2 stars.  The blue cheese dusted chips with french onion dip were still awesome. 5 stars. And the buffalo chicken dip was pretty good. 4 stars.  Everyone else in the party seemed to enjoy their burgers. Though, no one raved about their burgers.",

I also had the Fungi burger, which had a truffle marinated portebello. Burger was huge and juicy. Good stuff.   Friends had a variety of other items, but the most raved about dish was the truffle lobster mac and cheese.  Fun place for shakes and buns! Shakes and buns!",

With that out of the way, omnivore or vegan/vegetarian, you will enjoy their meal. I had the 'urth' burger and coconut raspberry milkshake. The Urth burger has an amazing consistency.

It's so unbelievably juicy and it melts in your mouth. The burger is simple, no gimmick, no super weird ingredients to put a spin on things. It's a burger plain, simple and perfect.  The beer and liquor selection is also top notch. In a town where beer is likely bud, bud, coors, and sam adams, this place differentiates itself with a unique worldly selection that any beer enthusiast can appreciate. Cocktails also were of the crafted nature, taking from the mixology trend and delivering to their customers something unique, tasty and made with attention to detail.   Ambiance is great. It's a an open layout with spot lighting on each table allowing you to really enjoy the aesthetics of culinary delight with your eyes before heartily enjoying them with your taste buds.",

Nevertheless there was some great and some eh in this place.  The Nom Nom Burger with Kobe beef was phenomenal.  Hands down the best burger I have ever had!  We then tried The Gold Standard burger, which failed to thrill...dont get it.  Next was the Fried Truffled Grilled Cheese...it was like three fried blocks of cheese.  Just looking at it made me nauseous, but after tasting it, I was done.  Meal over.  Now other things on the menu may surprise you and I would be willing to go back because that Nom Nom Burger had me Nomming.  Service was okay, but a bit slow for a 3pm time where the place was pretty empty.  I have higher expectations given this is at The Cosmopolitan.",

The next time around I tried their food and I wasn't as impressed.    They started us off with complimentary pizza-flavored popcorn which was a nice surprise.  I love popcorn and the pizza flavoring was unique and tasted good.  The burger I ultimately went with was the Gold Standard ($18.50).  It had a sirloin patty topped with goat cheddar cheese, smoked bacon, arugula, tomato confit and a garlic-chive aioli.  The burger was overwhelmed by the huge meat patty and unfortunately it was dry.           All their burgers come with french fries or you can upgrade to sweet potato fries, onion rings or a salad.  The fries were sadly not that great either.  They came stuck together and were over-salted.  My friend's sweet potato fries were better.  They've got cute cow decor and friendly service but for a fancy burger place, I expected better food.",

    "text": "Welcome to the Vegas strip, where a good burger will cost you almost 20 bucks, and that doesn't include a side.  However, pricing aside (particularly when you're visiting for work and the company generously pays), I had a really enjoyable meal.  I started with a cocktail, of course, the Rekorderlicious...a delightful concoction consisting of rekorderlig strawberry-lime cider, new amsterdam gin, st. germain, blueberry syrup, & lime juice.  I was originally afraid it would be entirely to sweet, especially with the blueberry syrup, but I was pleased that it was actually quite light and refreshing.  Quite dangerous if I sat down with a pitcher of them.  For dinner, I ordered the Nom Nom burger, medium:  waygu beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 island dressing, and potato chips...kind of interesting sort of take on a Big Mac-ish?  I was definitely a fan..salty, rich with a hint of sweet from the dressing an a nice crunch contrast from the potato chips.  For sides, the table split an order of fries and cheese curds.  The fries were hot & crispy, but nothing special.  The cheese curds were good...I was more of a fan of the mustard dipping sauce than the marinara...but there are better versions to be had in Milwaukee if that's what you're craving.  I looked at the boozy shake menu and almost went for it, but chose to grab dessert elsewhere...which was a mistake.  All-in-all, it's pricey for what it is, but that's pretty common in Vegas.  It was still a solid meal and I would definitely eat here again...this time adding in what looked like amazing milkshakes.",

Unfortunately, this shake and ice cream sandwich did not live up to their typically good-to-great Holstein's rep. It was all just bland. Cookies tasted like from the cookie aisle at the supermarket. The ice cream in the sandwich and in the shake did not taste like ice cream at all. I've enjoyed the Fat Boy shake in the past, so I don't know what gives....

Unfortunately I felt as if they were over priced and just hyped up. $15 for a tiny shake with 1/3 of the glass being whipped cream, a banana laffy taffy rope, a few chopped up mini Reese's cups and some Reese's pieces stuck to the glass with frosting. It's just \"meh.\" The shake is all watery and not thick and creamy like a good shake should be. The Reese's cups are few to slim. The Reese's pieces fall off when you try to scoop them off the glass. Unfortunately I will not be back. Try it for yourself if you feel like throwing away $16 (including tax.) I will not be doing that again.",

We split a Caesar salad, which was easily big enough to share and had lots of Parmesan flakes and a good kick of anchovy in the dressing. Burgers get cooked to your preferred degree of doneness, which is great given that the beef ranges from grass fed to wagyu. A component of the perfection of the burgers was how well balanced the ratios of (standout) bun to patty to toppings were: our burgers were each juicy and messy, but somehow we could still eat them with our hands and the toppings stayed contained in the bun. And, our plates stayed reasonably tidy looking while we ate. For the record, we had the VGK and Nom Nom burgers.",

Definitely a place that is trendy and hip inside since it is a place right on the strip.     Food Gold standard  * The burger was very juicy.  However, it had a little bit of a gamy taste to it. * The onion rings that I ordered with the burger were very oily.  Rising sun * Kobe beef had a very rich taste. * Sweet potato fries are the usual classics.   Service The customer service is very good.  We got seated right away as it was not too busy.",

After being seated no one came by, we didn't get water for 15 or so minutes until we flagged some other waiter down to get us water. We ended up getting double waters when our waiter finally got to us......Once our orders were finally taken, we waited an extremely long time to get our food, they forgot to put the order in after taking it.  2. Once we eventually did get our food, it was honestly quite basic and I've had better burgers. I asked for medium done and it way more on the well done side of things  Overall, we just left like we were forgotten and got some random food rushed out to us in the end. I didn't even finish my burger. We again had to ask some other waiter for our check and just left.",

I had their Forager burger and split an order of large fries with my brother (the portion is spot on- just enough, not too much)   The only not so great thing I can say about this place is due to the location the ambiance is extremely loud and busy. Other than that, I loved that there was no wait time to seat. Normally that would throw me off because an empty restaurant is never a good thing, but when we walked inside it was about 70% full, they are just on top of the seating arrangements and quite frankly everything else.   Make sure to check in to receive 50% off beer!",

Love the colorful vibes & music!  They have several sittings available: lounge, tables, & bar.  Our server was so friendly, informative, & prompt!  As we were ordering, he dropped off complimentary popcorn, which was an awesome twist to complimentary items given at restaurants.  Pizza Popcorn:  Complimentary.  Tasty!  But do not eat too much because their burgers are huge! Campfire S'mores Shake:  Their shake is 2 things: amazingly delicious & overly decorated!  But I love that they give you extra on the side.  To be honest, I picked out almost all of the toppings, except a few, & just drank the shake, which was so, so, so heavenly!  I highly recommend this flavor! Frozen Grasshopper Shake:  Mint Chocolate Chip.  Again, very nicely decorated, & the shake was yum.  Refreshing. Gold Standard:  Served with French Fries.  Wow, I have not had a good burger in awhile!  The beef sirloin was tasty, juicy, & super thick.  I loved the crunchy bun.  & what my tastebuds adored were their aged goat cheddar cheese & garlic-chive aioli.  The fries, I kid you not, best restaurant fries I have ever had!  I enjoyed the crispiness to them & the simple flavor.",

With crispy yams, teriyaki glaze, and tempura avocado, this was one of the most unique and original burger I've ever had... and I loved it. The flavors play in your mouth- bounce around between traditional American burger and traditional Japanese flavors. 100% would recommend for the sole reason that you should try something this unique.  The fries were also delicious. Nice and crunchy- I didn't even need ketchup for them!  My friend got the Gold Standard and he said it might just be the best burger he's ever had (and he's a HUGE burger eater).  Service-wise, they can be a tad slow. One of my friends had to leave early to catch his flight even after mentioning it.  Overall- worth the visit for the burgers!",

Service was friendly, attentive and efficient. Ambience is nice as well. We ordered quite a bit, so will let pics so some of what we had (too much to remember right now!), and you MUST try the shakes or the Grasshopper shake with just enough creme de mint! Delightful. The cheese curds were good but needed a different dipping sauce - the mustard seed based sauce was too runny to stay on the curds! The spring rolls were good, too, and included fried jalapeno slices - a nice change up. Would recommend as a very nice (slightly pricey) place for a relaxed yet formal feeling dining experience.",

And not in a good way.  I ordered The Fun-ghi, excited about the shrooms. I ordered it medium,  but it came so overcooked that the middle was brown and the edges were hard. The patty had no detectable seasoning, but the toppings were great. My fries had cleared sat out for so long that they shouldn't have been served. They were so soaked with oil that they were juicy, and they were actually COLD.  My husband got The Forager Burger, and his patty was perfect. It was tender and pink all the way through. His fries were crispy and pretty fresh, but they were also not that fresh so I don't know how long his batch had been sitting, but at least they weren't garbage.   This is the first time, in a very long time, that I've actually left a restaurant feeling disgusted. They didn't have a lot of customers for lunch, but serving a plate of leftover mess-ups to one person and a nice plate to the person next to them at the same table is really rude. Don't worry, Holsteins, you won't have to make it right. I sure as heck won't be eating anything you make again.",

I would recommend going to this restaurant a bit earlier or later to avoid the crowds.   I also tried their house beer which is made here in Nevada. It is also a pretty good light beer to have.

My girl ordered their campfire smores milkshake to share and damn that is an awesome milkshake. I didn't thought that one of the best milkshake that I ever taste is alcoholic. All of the ingredients of it in compliments each other. Other alcoholic milkshakes I tasted in the past have an overpowering vodka after taste, but this tasted like a regular shake.

I don't know if they offer dessert or not but we were not offered dessert at the end of our meal.    Nice menu, good variety of burgers. All burgers come with regular fries, up-charge for sweet potato fries or onion rings. We got the Golden Standard which was pretty good, meat was nice and juicy, toppings were delicious.   My friend got the Apple crumb martini or something like that, this drink was very good. Tasted like juice and candy but not too sweet...very good!  I liked the food but was not crazy impressed!

The art hanging on the wall has a great playful feel to the place.  Lets get to the food. As far as burger establishments once again i will say that when you charge $20 a burger it better be awesome. I will say that Im a little upset that i spent $70 for 2 burgers and 2 beverages and that was including tip. But spending time with my cousin who was staying here at the cosmo made it worth it.  Fun-Ghi Burger (3/5)- By itself it would have probably been too much but i added a fried egg and it made the powerful truffle flavor balance out. without the egg i wouldnt have enjoyed the burger as much but i did like it.   Turkey Burger (4/5)- My wife had this and she really enjoyed it and said it was well put together.I dont have anything specific to say about it because i didnt try it.  The only way we'll be back is if we go with friends or family it is a great place to socialize and very laidback. Service was great our server really took care of us and for i will be back to enjoy some more burgers. Looking forward to trying the Rising Sun.  French Fries are nothing special. But my wife did enjoy her sweet potato fries probably because it was different.",

Having to catch a flight a couple hours after we checked out, I wanted to fit one last meal into our trip. Thankfully, Holsteins was right downstairs!  *Holsteins special lager (4.8%) nv, usa ($5.50 for 12.5oz) Having a meal without a drink in Vegas is weird to me. So of course I ordered a beer. This was super light and easy to drink.  *Billionaire burger: kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, truffle mayo ($32) Yum! I'm a foie-aholic, so this definitely hit the spot! A huge tender piece of foie topped this beautiful burger. Great flavor. The kobe beef also melted in my mouth. I was in heaven.  *The steakhouse burger: beef patty crusted w/black pepper, greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato, onions, mushrooms, cheese ($18) The roommate's burger. I took a bite. But after eating the kobe beef, this seemed tough. The roommate seemed to enjoy it and finished the whole burger.  So is the billionaire burger worth $32?! Absolutely! One of best burgers I've had in a while!",

I would recommend the milkshakes. They have a special set of milkshakes on the menu that come with alcohol for about $13. If you choose to not include any alcohol in your shake, it will cost you a mere $9 like the other standard non-alcoholic shakes.   Service was friendly.",

We were staying at PH and stopped by Gordon Ramsay's Bugr but holy cow (no pun intended!)...that line and wait time for a juicy beef burger was super long!  Whipped out the Yelp app, and saw some bomb ratings for Holsteins right across the walkway bridge at the Cosmo. Conveniently located on the 2nd floor by Marquee, it was super easy to find and we were seated within 15 minutes.  Decor is super interesting! Looks modern but if you have a fear of cows, stay away haha. Lots of cartoonish cows everywhere!   Burgers were a little under $20 each which isn't bad considering it's the Cosmo! The wifey had the GOLD STANDARD BURGER. This thing was fully loaded with bacon, arugala, tomato confit, and a garlic sauce. I went a little bit out of bounds and got the RISING SUN BURGER...kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, and a piece of avocado tempura!  Not the best burger I EVER had, but it was super solid and tasty. My only complaint were that the fries and onion rings tasted like generic frozen ones...but they were included with the burger, while most places charge for fries separately.  I'd come back...especially if I'm staying at Cosmo!",

That was unique! I could even taste the pepperoni on it!   The service was excellent and the price was reasonable for the setting. I'll surly be back to try more of the burgers out.",

I took the suggestion of yelp since it stated that the gold standard burger was voted best burger in vegas and I was amazed on how good the burger really was. I know $20 for a burger is pricy, but if the burgers was this amazing I would even pay $40 a burger! I got it in medium so the meat would still be juicy and pinkish inside. Never had a burger with baby arugula instead of lettuce but that was such a genius mix of flavor, i've always loved aioli, so this was a great mixture of flavor. Wish I had enough room in my stomach to try other stuff on the menu. I will definitely be coming back every time I land in Vegas!!!",

    "text": "This was on my to-do list thanks to Yelp. Based on the pictures I'd seen, I knew I had to make my way to this establishment. This restaurant is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel mall area. It also afforded me the chance to check it out, and I was impressed. The ambiance and atmosphere of both the restaurant and hotel are hip, modern, trendy, and fun.  To my relief (and something I've noticed is not somewhat uncommon in Vegas thankfully), there was no wait upon entering at around 4.30 (albeit it was a week night). The service started a little slow but improved throughout the meal. It didn't take too long to receive our meals, which also pleased me.  I ordered the salad and added grilled chicken to it. Was it ordinary? Yes. There was nothing remarkable about it, nor did it have any ingredients I didn't have at home. But it suited me for my health-conscious habits, whereas other places may not offer something so simple. Additionally, the grilled chicken tasted decent enough.  My friend really enjoyed the burger, and I admit it did look to be of good quality.  Another nice touch is the popcorn provided once you are seated-always nice to have a nibble food while you wait for your meal.  Check out my pics of the bathroom-very trendy indeed. There is only one stall (which while nice and private, I imagine runs into a problem if the restaurant is rather crowded).  Three stars because while the atmosphere was great, this didn't offer stand-out food. It hit the spot for what it was worth, and I'm glad I tried it. There was nothing remarkable though, and for me it's a one and done type of place. Tried it and on to the next one, but I wish them the best. Moooo (for the cool cow statue).",

    "text": "Meating time.  There are burgers, and then there are BURGERS.  Holsteins serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. and overall I had a positive first time experience enjoying good food with great company.  LOCATION:  Second floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  On my recent trip, I visited Holsteins for lunch with two friends, one of whom had previously dined last year.  We decided to meet when they opened, and its a lucky thing as we did since a small line had already formed before their 11am opening.  Thank goodness for being early.  In this case, the early diner gets the burger.  FOOD:  There were three of us and collectively we ordered the Gold standard burger, the California turkey, and the Big Fat Greek.  All burgers/sandwiches were served with fries.  I was initially unsure on what to order, but thanks to a glowing recommendation from our server, I decided on their award winning Gold Standard Burger.    The Gold Standard Burger is aptly named, and worth its weight in gold for that matter.  This has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had.  This dry aged beef sirloin (smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic aioli) was prepared well, while the goat cheese didn't bother me that much, though other reviewers have stated otherwise.  I thought all the condiments served complemented the burger well.  My taste buds were quite happy indeed.  The fries, sadly, were just ok in my humble opinion.  The burger was the True shining (gold) star at lunch.  As for my two friends, I believe they enjoyed their burgers too, as evidenced by the nearly spotless plates at the end of the meal.    Overall, we all enjoyed our meal/food.  SERVICE:  The hostess was quite friendly and promptly showed us to our table.  The server was a friendly and polite young woman.  She greeted us and took our drink orders.  She also recommended some appetizers and milk shakes, but we all decided to order just burgers and fries.  As previously mentioned, the server made such an enthusiastic endorsement regarding the Gold Standard Burger, and I thanked her more than once for her recommendation.  She  provided extra napkins, provided drink refills, checked on us periodically throughout the meal.    BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and great company.  I strongly recommend the Gold Standard Burger.",

A lot of places will just have captions, and it's hard looking at a okay and reading the announcers comments. We also lucked out with a open booth table in the bar area.   Golden Standard burger- is pretty much a typical burger with better ingredients.   The Rising Sun burger- omg... It was described by our waitress Tess as a sushi burger without the fish taste. She also said it was her favorite, so I had to give it a try. It is so well flavored, every bite was delicious.   Fries- nothing special. Actually on the soggy side...they taste in comparison to McDonald's fries.   Strawberry shake- NA version was tasty with an extra amount that doesn't fit into the glass on the side. So basically, two people can share this shake.   The prices are high! Both burgers were $18.5 each and the NA shake was $9. $18.5 for a burger and fries... I would at least expect the fries to be just as amazing as the burger. They have onion rings and sweet potato fries as an option for a couple bucks more.",

Anyway, 2 people next to me got burgers. They looked sooo dry. I felt bad. I wished they read yelp.   So I tried something else off their limited menu. I just got simple buffalo wings.

Pretty cool little spot, they do a good job with the limited space and try to make it feel classy in a sea of people coming to conferences and clubbers out drinking.  Prices were fair, pretty sure my burger and fries were around $15 bucks. Seating is snug, tables are close enough that you can make out other people's conversations.  Bathrooms located inside the venue make it convenient for those who are grabbing dinner and wanting to wash their hands.  Would consider coming back, although there's a lot of good food on the Strip, so I find it unlikely that I would make it a point to visit just on the merit of food alone, but YMMV. Enjoy!",

Like just all restaurants in Las Vegas I expected to pay more than what a typical burger joint would charge in any other city but also expected a higher quality product and for what it was, I was disappointed.  The presentation looked great but the burger itself was very flat on flavor and somewhat dry.  For just about a $20 burger(no sides) I was hoping for more of a gourmet experience.  I much prefer Burger Lounge, not sure if it is the grass fed meat they use but it is one of the better burgers I have eaten.  The Holstein burger patty felt like it was frozen and had been sitting in a freezer for more than it should.  The sweet potato fries were ok but not memorable, I think the onion rings were done well.  We wound up leaving most of the burger on the plate and would not go back.",

We stood at the bar for a good 15 minutes while other people got served right next to us and we didnt. First and only time I will come here. Being a Vegas local, that works with businesses this is 1000% a business I would not recommend due to the lack of customer service. Again if all your trying to do is pay $20+ for a milkshake with a ton toppings for an Instagram picture, fine but if not done visit here. 2 stars simply cuz my wife thought the milkshake was cool.",

I made the mistake in ordering the same burger I had once before years ago that I hated. Each time i thought it sounded so good and each time was seriously let down.   I ordered the California Turkey Burger and it was FUNK-EEEEE. Just weird. From the Russian sauce being... who knows what, to the bizarre cucumber slaw that tastes like Thai food, it's a truly odd flavor profile. To be totally fair, the turkey patty was good- flavorful and juicy. The sweet potato fries were bomb and I would order those again.   Didn't get a shake this time, but I have in the past and I would highly recommend those. I probably wouldn't eat a burger here again, but would come for a shake and snack of fries or a side.",

    "text": "If you have an APPETITE this is the place to go. I'm not talking about \"I need a burger and fries\" - I mean \"I am STARVING and need to eat like 3 meals\" type of hunger. Let's start with the good stuff - their milkshakes. I ordered one of their Bam-Boozled Shakes - the Campfire Smores to be exact. First off this shake takes EXACTLY like a campfire smore. The graham crumble and the chocolate balls were only the start of my sugar high. The toasted marshmallow was the perfect icing on top of the brain freeze I was getting while slurping this heart attack sucker. After attempting to finish this enormous milkshakes (which was a fail - after all this milkshake was taller than me). I had forgotten about the entree I had ordered and was already stuffed. For my entree I had ordered the Surf n Turf quesadilla (which I quietly thanked myself for not ordering a gigantic burger like everyone else). The quesadilla was a great way to end my food coma. It was the right size and had enough cheese and avocado cream to bring out the lobster & steak.   Although the service was a little slower than I would've liked - I'm not a fan of waiting more than 15 minutes for small requests such as water, extra napkins, extra utensils etc). I could see that the restaurant was busy and that there were a number of large groups around the time we came.   Overall I would definitely recommend coming to Holstein's and trying out their various types of burgers. There seemed to be a huge variety of burger choices whether it was turkey, meat, wagyu or a simple classic burger.",

Love the idea of having popcorn as a complimentary snack rather than breadsticks, something different. I ordered the vegan raspberry coconut milkshake and their veggie burger. That milkshake alone is why I will be coming back! It was the perfect amount of tart and sweetness. If you're a fan of coconut I would recommend this milkshake! The burger was piled high with avocado, sprouts, tomatoes, and a crispy veggie patty and came with a side of fries. The service was quick to make sure we were doing okay and filling our waters throughout the night. Something you need in this Vegas heat!",

Nothing fancy but it tastes spicy and made the way I like it. They have two kinds of bloody Mary's and one I believe has bacon. I get the regular one.   First visit, I had the classic hamburger which was good but I wouldn't say it was \"amazing!\"  But it was just a typical burger. (Im glad I went back to see my friends burgers)   I sat at the bar first night and service was fine. Again, nothing spectacular and they were semi-busy meaning that the bar wasn't packed but there were people there and in the restaurant.   The next day my friends went back with me and we got a table. The waitress we had that day which was July 6th was sweet and helpful. I had the chicken sandwich this time and it was delicious. It had two good size pieces of chicken. (Yummy, more chicken then bread) They were indecisive on their burgers and she said \"you can get a classic burger anywhere\". I was like \"darn, that's True! Go with a good one\". They both ordered Gold Standards and they said it was delicious. One said its been awhile since she had a burger that good. I was thinking next time I'll have to try it.   We went back before we left to get a Bloody Mary for me and shakes which have liquor for them.  They looked very fulfilling. We asked for everything to go since we were leaving. I'm not much on milk shakes but they said they tasted great. They finished them before we got in taxi.   I def need to go back to try another one of their burgers out. ;)",

Maybe my memory is fading, but just seems like this place tastes more like a chain style burger place rather than the first time I ate here where I was really impressed. Anyway, probably more like 3.5 stars, certainly not 4 or 5 any longer. Not terrible, but likely not worth the extra walk/drive unless you are staying at the Cosmo.",

    "text": "2:00 pm, Saturday in Las Vegas.  You wake up, finally, and realize that your intense inebriation from Friday night has been replaced with a hankering for some good food.  This is me a few weekends ago.    I was supposed to wake up and go to Bouchon in the morning to get a fancy breakfast, but somehow that didn't happen.  I even told my friends I would meet them there.  Sleep prevailed for a few more hours.  When my friends got back from their breakfast, I was hungry for lunch.  As we ventured to explore the new Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins immediately caught my eye... well the pink cow in front sure did.  The modern feel and fun music drew us in.   The menu has a bunch of fun items to choose from.  Their list of burgers is amazing.  Delicious meaty burgers.  They also had a great selection of alcoholic shakes (Bam-Boozled Shakes) and some cute flavored shots.  They also have plenty of beer and wine.  The ultimate burger spot I'd say.  I decided to get the Rising Sun.  It was a Kobe beef burger with Teriyaki glaze, furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  This was recommended from the waitress as her favorite burger.  It was honestly quite salty but it was really good.  The best part was the tempura avocado.  We also tried the Korean Bull-gogi.  That came with an over easy egg, kim chee, and kalbi glaze.  This burger was not as salty and also very good.  The Kobe beef of the Rising Sun made that burger super moist though.  To drink we shared the Oreo shake, which had Bailey's Irish Cream in it.  Make sure that you finish it cold because a luke-warm alcoholic shake is not so good.  The Bailey's was really good and just barely noticeable, except when I felt my the heat in my face.  It is kinda pricey for a shake though $11.  I would definitely come back to get some yummay burgers next time I am in LV... which I hope is soon!",

    "text": "I've been in LA too long. I've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. So, during a much-needed trip to Las Vegas, I decided to stop in to Holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the City of Angels.  After winding my way through the Cosmopolitan Hotel past the Chandelier Bar, I spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the Holsteins logo. At the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. I opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because I felt like the seriousness with which I was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.  The cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but I knew that I wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. I chose the Tiramisu Milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. The milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. The tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, Patron Cafe, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. The shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. It was the perfect dessert.  I also ordered a Gold Standard Burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. My main complaint about the menu is that half of the burgers listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. So, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.  The burger I ordered was still great. It was cooked medium-rare when I requested medium, but I really don't care too much unless I catch salmonella and die. The patty was flavorful. The toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. I was delighted that the burger was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.  The waitress was fantastic. She helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. Both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which I appreciated very much because I could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.  The meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. You won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at Holsteins.  They even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. I could have cried. Oh, how I've missed Nevada, the land free from open container laws.",

    "text": "On my most recent Vegas getaway of sorts, I ate the whole time.  This conclusion didn't arise until a particularly high volume of repeated similar questions.  That strong indicator surmised each time a \"How was Vegas?\" came up.     One of my favorite landing spots was Holsteins.  Who doesn't like a good burger?  A vegetarian may raise their hand.  Even then, these burgers may sway the opinion of the strongest vegetarian for one meal.    We moseyed on in around 2:30 in the afternoon for a late lunch.    Opening up the menu, besides the fascinating selection of shakes were the prices.  Expect price ranges to reach double digits.  I was really tuned into the Rising Sun so I got that.  Our waiter persuaded Bun into ordering their award winning burger.  I'm sure the fact the waiter was good looking had nothing to do with her decision either.  I just want to throw that out there for giggles.    Generally, I dislike teriyaki sauce.  The Rising Sun I ordered really shed a new light on my view of it.  Glazed with a teriyaki sauce, it meshed amazingly with the spicy mayo.  \"Kobe beef\", honestly labeled or not, was cooked medium on request.  Biting down to notice a dash of furikake was probably the biggest glowing surprise.  Lastly, the best part of the burger was certainly the tempura avocado.  Not only adding a different layer of texture, it added a good combined taste.  Come on.  Who doesn't like tempura?    Add all that up produces an ultra surreal burger experience.    As a side note since note, Bun's Gold Standard was a big thumbs up.  In her case, you could say little thumbs up.  Speechless through the first few bites, she almost finished the burger.  I'll have to try it next time.  Knowing me, I'd end up getting the Rising Sun again since it was so good.   Bright graphics on the wall are very energetic and lively.  Service was cordial.  It conveyed a vibe of a high class Hooter's.  That is with 10,000% better food, minus the Hooter's girls of course.    Now, you may be wondering.  Where can you find this joint?  It's right in the Cosmopolitan.  Find it yet?  Enjoy their solidly made burger and thank me when your're done.",

Nice daytime attempt to hit family style with the booths and a typical Vegas crowd with the separate lounge and bar area.  Food: The fries were great and the burgers were good, but nothing special. We had the sunrise and the one with angus steak The shakes were awesome. I had the drunken monkey but was far from any kind of buzz, still tasty though.  Go again? Meh, maybe if I craved a shake; however, I'd rather try something new.",

We were fortunate to be be seated quickly. The staff was attentive and very nice.   And the food was oh so delicious. The burgers were so juicy, the toppings were fresh, the bacon tasted just right. We even got free onion rings, on the house. Our waiter said the chef felt the first set of onion rings were too crispy. Both rings were delicious.   But here it comes, literally.  Most of us ended up getting a minor case (thankfully) of food poisoning. Yes that's right, we got sick. And this was our first meal, so it wasn't another meal that caused it. We started feeling ill a few hours later. It really sucked because we were so looking forward to clubbing. We did make it to the club, but left after an hour. Our stomachs hurt too much.   I really wanted to like this place.  But i just can't.",

Our first order was for the fried pickles, which was quite good.  My friend and I split two different burgers to ensure we could maximize taste testing.  I ordered the Gold Standard and my friend ordered the El Caliente, which was both proudly devoured.  The burgers were grilled perfectly and the toppings worked well with one another.  The drinks were also good.  Another perk was our server brought us a complimentary dessert, which was a meringue mint delight.  So good - just try it.

I believe Holstein's delivered. The burgers and shakes were delicious and the service was excellent.  Completely open to the pedestrian way, so it is a bit noisy, but it's a comfortable restaurant to dine in. Our server was very prompt, gracious and attentive. I really appreciated their attention to detail. Within moments of sitting down we were served the trademark mini-bucket of tasty popcorn and glasses of water without asking. They've clearly put thought into what a good customer experience should be in their restaurant. You've got a customer, immediately give them something to eat and drink. Makes sense to me!  The menu is well-presented and easy to understand. Burgers and shakes and some other stuff. Everything on the menu sounded great. We opted for a Captain Hook (salmon burger) and a Rising Sun (teriyaki burger). Both, due to their combination of flavors and textures, transcended the normal definition of \"burger\". They were DELICIOUS.  On leaving we ordered a Cereal Bowl and a Drunken Monkey. These were a couple of the most delicious and unique milkshakes we've ever had. You'll just have to go a try one for yourself. A very tasty treat.  I think that, although I can't afford to eat here as often as I'd like, this burger joint is my favorite in LV.",

They served a really light beer, I really enjoyed it, it was refreshing, luckily I had this to wash down my burger.  I ordered the Gold Standard. I like how the burger was well-intact when I cut it and half and ate it. Cleaniness makes a world of difference. I ordered the burger medium, and it looked pink and medium (while my friend also ordered medium, but her's looked more well done), but it was extremely dry. It was too dry to taste the quality of the patty. Perhaps, it was because the patty was aged, so the flavors were more definitive, but I wonder that's why it made the patty way too dry. Don't get me wrong, the flavors of the burger were bold and tasted pretty good. It came well together, and the goat cheese cheddar stood out in a good way. Pretty delicious burger, except for the fact the patty was really dry and it's overpriced.  The fries were cold and also tasted old.  I did however try my friend's Rising Sun burger, that tasted good. The flavors were once again bold, and it had a pretty unique taste that stands out. I liked that one more.  Comparing this burger with like a Father's Office or Umami (I do not like Umami), it tastes about the same (although I like Father's Office the best), quality and unique taste-wise, they're all about equilavent, except those other burgers costs $13-14, while here it costs $17. Not sure if it's worth it. At least it made me not feel as bad paying $13-14 for the burgers at the other places now.  Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 stars, rounded down.",

We walked by Holsteins and decided to pop in for some burgers and fries.  The ambiance was nice and the DJ was spinning some awesome music. We were quickly seated and the waiter took our order. My sister and I settled on the Hen House (has bacon and a fried egg, bam!) while the others got Korean Bull'Gogi (fried egg and lots of kimchi) and The Rising Sun (teriyaki). The waiter was super patient and helpful with us when we tried to decided and even allowed for us to cut burgers in half to share. If you decide for smaller portions, they even have sliders which is a great option for those who wanna keep it light before dancing.  The burgers came out with either shoestring or steakcut fries and both were delicious. I think I may have been a fan of the shoestring though as it had a great crisp to it while steakcut had a great potato-y inside. The burgers were cooked exactly how we we wanted (in my case it was medium) and was a big-ass burger. I'm glad I opted to share mine with someone because I wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own.   I'd definitely come here in the future to eat if I'm headed to the club since it's right across from Holsteins but I gotta go back next time to try their shakes! They looked great, but something about all that milk and alcohol didn't mix for me, so I decided against it this time around. All in all, I much prefer this joint compared to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay.",

My favorite shakes are the Green Grasshopper, a minty and chocolatey mix of wonderfulness and the straight Oreo. I love the burgers, I've had a bunch of them and I believe the Rising sun and the Steak/Mushroom burger are both delivered to this planet from some culinary god.  There are a few drawbacks though, price is one. Pretty expensive, but its what you expect for being in one of the upper class casinos. My GF got the Ahi tuna sliders and they were a JOKE, not good and cost something like $15. Also it has a very club like atmosphere, don't come here expecting a romantic dinner or anything, this is a bar scene more than a restaurant.  Stick with the Burgers and Shakes here and you can't go wrong. Stray out of those categories and you may be disappointed. Overall this is one of my favorite spots in town, also because the Cosmo rocks and the chandelier bar is right next door.",

But I DID have all that, and was not let down in the least.  This is NOT one of those places where you pay a grip and then feel cheated after your meal; the food is well worth it.  Definitely going back and bringing people.  Located on the 2nd floor at Cosmopolitan, next to Va Bene Caffe (also a decent place).  There.  Now you can't use 'getting lost' as an excuse not to go.",

I ordered The Gold Standard and that was a DAM good burger.   The Rising Sun also got rave reviews from my friends along with the shakes. The ambiance of the place feels like I'm in some Cartoon Network-like place, which is pretty cool, I feel.   If you're eating at the Cosmopolitan, chances are you're going to spend a lot of money. If you're looking for the best value for your dollar in this hotel, make it Holsteins.",

    "text": "Another featured burger in the \"Vegas Seven\" Magazine\". Came here to have the obvious..  After I ordered the Bartender replied: \"that's what we're known for.. it was ranked top 5 in the nation..\"  Gold Standard with steak cut fries: The burger came out perfectly constructed and everything looked proportioned from the top to bottom. Looked like a \"Lbs Burger or Bachi Burger\".. Well, come to find out this place was related to \"Lbs\", same chef.. It came with Dry Aged Beef Sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic-chive aioli on a kinda sweet bun.. The medley of flavors worked pretty well but just like \"lbs\" and even Bachi burger, I was not blown away. Just merely satisfied.. The burger patty wasn't that flavorful but had a nice texture. It was all the supporting toppings that gave it some life. Overall, it just didn't do it for me..  Steak cut fries: Awesome! Delicate light crunchy skin and inside had a crumbly fine mashed potato textured consistency. Loved it!  Service Outstanding, Atmosphere fun (probably would of been even more fun with one of their Insane alcohol shake blends!), Value was fair (pricey ingredients but the burger didn't deliver much flavor) But I liked the Fries! =/",

    "text": "Admittedly, I would have given this place four stars due to the sheer exorbitant prices if it weren't for the amazing, if not the best, burgers I have had in my 26 years of life. And believe me, I've had my fair share of burgers. Okay - enough about the rave and onto the food:  I must start with the free starter popcorn, which was perfectly salted and just the right amount of butter so good that I had to ask for second!  For appetizer, we ordered the Surf and Turf Quesadillas, which has a combination of broiled steak and lobster that complements surprisingly well topped off with Manchego cheese to give it a rich texture to go along with Avocado cream that leaves a rather refreshing after taste  For main course, I ordered the Rising Sun burger (A must have based on other yelpers' validations) and the steak fries as a side. The juicy Kobe beef spread with the Teriyaki glaze just burst with flavor, but not too salty as it is matched with a slightly sweet addition from the cripsy yam. At the same time, the Spicy mayo and tempura avocada adds a tantalizing kick to the already delicious burger all on its own. I also added a fried Egg which just kicks it up another notch. The steak fries that came with the burger just left me speechless as I could not even taste the grease but had so much crisp and flavor that left me licking the seasoning off of my thumbs   All in all, what more can you ask for than a perfect burger and a beer in a chilling afternoon at Vegas? I would have liked to try Truffle lobster Mac N Cheese but there just was not enough stomach to fit it all or time on the agenda to come back for round 2. Definitely a 5 star unforgettable experience - Super winning!",

We thought dining here would result in another great burger joint option for us, but alas, we probably won't come back unless we happen to be at the Cosmo (unlikely, since we're locals and avoid the Strip pretty consistently).  I ordered the Hen House. My friend chose to devour the Longhorn. Both were flat-ish patties with a dry, burnt outer layer. There wasn't much flavor going on anywhere in or around these burgers.  High point number one: I ordered the sweet potato fries for $2 extra, and they were well done and very yummy.  High point number two: The art on the walls is killer.  Anyway, the consensus is, if we want to spend $20 per person on big fat tasty burgers, we will go to Burger Bar instead (or fire up the grill at home).",

I'm not sure if it's just me or maybe it was an off day but I've had plenty of burgers better than this.   I will say though that the shakes they have are amazing, try to stay away from the floats.   We spent about $76 incl. tip on two burgers and two shake/floats.   gold standard- I asked for my burger medium and it came out to medium well. I really didn't like the meat and it was $17! $17 is okay for me as long as it tastes good, but it was dry and pretty bland.  i understand that every restaurant on the strip is expensive, but don't come here expecting SHAKE SHACK quality and i know it's wrong of me to compare since shake shack is located only in NYC, but there is no comparison.   Maybe it was an off day when i went since they weren't very busy but our burgers took forever to arrive.",

It is a little pricey but the patty is so big and juicy that it makes sense to pay $$ for the good quality. Plus it is SUPER filling. I actually shared this with a friend and we were both so full off of just half the burger. Moreover the fries were also good, not too thick or too thin but just right. I liked the crispiness of them and how they weren't too salty.  My friends and I actually got our orders to go and I was the first one to order. However, everyone's food came out first and when my meal still didn't come out I mentioned this to the cashier. I jokingly asked if we could get some extra fries and not only did she throw in a box of fries but she also told me to choose a milkshake on the house. I got the red velvet milkshake which was TO DIE FOR. I loved the texture (had a slight crunch) and how sweet and creamy it was. I'm so glad I got to experience their shakes since I heard that they were pretty good. However, they are originally around $14 which is pretty expensive. I would recommend sharing one between friends so you can at least get a taste for it.   I think everyone should go here at least once on their trip to Vegas! You won't regret it :)",

It was like butter, baby!   Our waitress was alright, but my goodness the prices. That's what you get when you're in Vegas (KT PERRY WUZ RITE OMGZ).  The dessert menu looked awesome with all the shakes and malts, but I had already paid about 30 not including tip since I added a salad, mushrooms, and a fried egg to my burger. No doubt it was good, but I gotta hit the prices with a \"Who ya crappin?\".   I'd go back, especially if I didn't have pay. Kobe (burger)!",

    "text": "Updating once again based on experiencing the BILLIONAIRE BURGER.  My friend and I ended up eating here because we came to Cosmopolitan to eat at Comme Ca, unfortunately SEMA was in town and Comme Ca was hosting an event in their dining room. Being that we did not want to sit and eat at the overly crowded bar at Comme Ca, we walked over to Holsteins. We had to wait for a seat here too so I was really freakin hungry when we sat down.   One bummer about this experience was they did not bring out any complimentary popcorn. *womp womp*  Other than that our server was very nice and helpful. He knew the menu well. BUT. My friend and I knew we were getting the Billionaire Burger because we HAD to have a burger with foie gras in it. Yep. This burger comes with a big chunk of grilled foie gras right in the burger. It has Kobe beef with frisee, port-onion marmalade and truffle mayonnaise. DANG. If you don't feel like hitting the high-roller tables after this burger something is wrong with you. I also added some cheese to mine.   We also split the \"Snickers, Please!\" dessert, which was decent, but I would suggest going with one of their bomboozled milkshakes and have it WITH your burger instead.  Holstein's does it RIGHT in the world of fancy burgers in Vegas.",

It is better than the other burgers available at Holsteins (even fancy shmancy billionaire burger, which is pretty good). It is better than burgers in high end steakhouse joints. It is better (if not cheaper) than in-n-out.  Sometimes I get excited to try other burgers, but then I am annoyed, b/c I am not eating the \"Gold Standard\" burger, medium.   Other burgers want to be this burger.",

This is a great place to go for foods and to get your night started whether you are clubbing or whatever you plan to do when in Vegas. It's also great for locals that want to enjoy an adult milkshake and a burger!! I recommend this place to everyone that comes and visits me!!!  You can come here casually dressed or dressed in your club attire--no judgements ever been made when dining here! Trust, I've been to this restaurant both in casual wear after coming from a concert in the Boulevard Pool and in club attire heading to Marquee after dinner.   I've tried the Birthday Cake milkshake which is just yum and a monkey one (can't remember the name for the life of me, but I want to say that it had bananas in it).  I've tried the turkey burger sliders and the chicken sandwich. Both were like heaven in my mouth. Their fries and onion rings are great as well!   I can't think of anything bad to say about this place! Whether you are visiting or a local like me, I highly recommend this place!!",

A look at their menu and it all sounded delicious, but the prices are more than what I would like to pay for a dish.  So I would pass until this past weekend.  I finally decided to treat myself at Holstein's because I had just finished the Las Vegas Rock n' Roll half marathon and I felt I deserved it!  haha.  I ordered the ahi poke and the Memphis bbq burger.  The ahi poke was a small portion (we shared amongst 3 people), but I savored every bite of it.  It was the freshest and tastiest poke I've had so far.  The Memphis bbq burger was succulent and juicy.  You really can't go wrong with bbq pulled pork and a burger patty sandwiched in between 2 buns.  Something about their burger patty was different, yet delicious.  OMG... I wish I could go back.  lol  Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Holstein's.  I would definitely consider coming back to try other menu items.. if I don't spend all my money on gambling.  haha",

With that said, I would still give this place a 3.5 star review, because their claim is subjective anyways :)  Like I said before, the burger was mediocre. Pretty dry and not much taste. My boyfriend added a fried egg on his as well. Typically, when you order a fried egg, you would expect it to be over easy, right (especially so you can get that #eggporn picture duh)? This egg was over hard AF, so icky. I guess we should have specified so it's not their fault.  Anyways, besides the mediocre burger, the staff was very attentive and so sweet! Their fries and onion rings were really good, too. We even got 50% off a beer for checking in. Also, I would come back for the milkshakes. They were oversized and had alcohol in them (win win).",

I see this place all the time when I'm at The Cosmopolitan but never took it seriously because it looks a little cartoon-ey with the cartoon cow images hanging outside of the restaurant. But OMG I am a huge fan and cannot wait to come back! Here's why:  - Once you sit down, they give you a bucket of popcorn which is basically like crack. Freaking addicting. I don't know what kind of seasoning is on it, but we loved it so much that we bought 2 boxes of it to take with us! - Boozy milkshakes. And they are amazingly obnoxious! We ordered a boozy milkshake that had candy corn stuck to the rim, a candy cane sticking out, and a SLICE OF PUMPKIN PIE on top! So insane and so good and so genius! - French fries are crucial. They have regular and sweet potato, so we ordered both. They were perfectly crunchy and that's exactly how they should be. The portions were also very generous! And I think they make their own ketchup which means they take french fries seriously. They also have onion rings if you're not a french fry person. - Saved the best for last. THE BILLIONAIRE BURGER. Here are the deets: Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, & truffle mayo. I took a bite of my burger and thought \"holy crap!\" The burger was so rich and so full of flavor! The bun was fluffy which is always a plus. The beef was delicious and perfectly cooked. Foie gras was fatty and tasty. I ate this thing so fast and was so sad when it ended. If you love rich burgers, get this one!  Can't wait to come back here. If you love burgers, get one here. And a boozy milkshake. I promise you will not be disappointed!",

I had the banana foster, very creamy and they give you a lot so you can share with another person. It was a little too sweet and would be better for dessert but I preferred my beer with my burger. The burger was smaller than I had expected but that was fine since I filled up with the shake. I tried the fungi burger and it was very tasty! The mushrooms were on point. The beef was quality and juicy. I got their sweet potato fries and they were crispy and delicious too. My sis had the regular fries and they looked soggy and maybe the oil wasn't hot enough for them?   Our server was super friendly and nice. Unfortunately, a lot of their draft beers which was too bad. The restaurant is clean, bright and I love the cow artwork! Definitely a more refined burger joint!",

I saw that Holsteins had a short wait and I've always wanted to try Holsteins' freak shake, so I jumped out of the buffet waiting line and went to Holsteins instead!  *'Urth' vegan burger (5/5): This burger was out of this world good! Totally incomparable to the vegan burgers I've tried at other restaurants. Their vegan patty is \"housemade\" which is what makes it so unique and delicious! Their vegan patty was so amazing! Definitely on my \"Best Vegan Foods to Try\" list! Any vegans, vegetarians, or maybe even meat lovers would love this burger!   *Cookies & Cream (4/5): A MILKSHAKE WITH AN ENTIRE ICE CREAM COOKIE SANDWICH ON TOP?! COUNT ME IN! When our waiter presented me with my Cookies & Cream milkshake, I was so excited (and I wasn't even sugar high yet). This milkshake was delicious, except it was too sweet for my taste. If you love sweets, then this you will probably love this very much. This is a bit too much for one person to finish, but it's great for sharing. You can get all the boozy milkshakes without the alcohol for $3 less than the regular price for the boozy milkshakes, so that's what my friends and I did.   *Frozen Grass Hopper (5/5): My friend got this milkshake and I was so jealous after I tasted it because it was so good! To me it was so much better than the Cookies & Cream milkshake because it was a lot less sweeter. I also happen to be a mint ice cream enthusiast, so it was a 5 star milkshake for me. Definitely going to get this milkshake next time I come back and I definitely recommend this milkshake to any mint ice cream lovers!  I came walking out of the restaurant very full and satisfied. The fries and onion rings, were all very good, especially the burgers. The milkshakes were very unique and tasty as well. I can proudly say that Holsteins indeed makes the best burgers in Vegas, and maybe even makes the best in the state. I will definitely come back again for their delicious burgers and milkshakes!",

    "text": "Got into Vegas semi late on our first night. We were staying at Aria but walked right next door to The Cosmopolitan to try out Holsteins. It had come highly recommended from some friends at home and obviously other Yelpers. I made a reservation in advance knowing that we were going to get in late, and didn't want to have to deal with a line or a wait. We were promptly seated and our waitress greeted us and got us waters pretty quickly. We made use of the check in deal for half off drafts. FYI you have to purchase an entree for it to apply. We ended up sharing the gold standard burger, so only one of our beers was $5, the other was $10. We started with the Philly Egg Rolls. They were great. Three to a serving but they're pretty massive, so you could easily divide them into 6. The Gold Standard burger was fantastic!! The combination of the cheese, confit & aioli really sealed the deal ! We also shared a side of onion rings, which were tasty as well, but kind of ridiculous that the burger didn't come with any side. We finished the meal with the Donutella - an adult boozy milkshake that was probably 9272 calories but at that point . It was fantastic as well! Overall we enjoyed our meal. There were a few times our waitress kind of just disappeared and we had to wait for water refills or an additional request, but it wasn't horrible. I felt like it was kind of expensive for what we got, but I understand it's Vegas and on the strip. Just a little annoying that our bill was $70+ with tip for 2 people. If you're into burgers or absurdly caloric delicious alcoholic milk shakes, definitely check this place out !",

The s'mores one is the best in my opinion. I had the street tacos on my first trip there. I don't think they are on the menu anymore, but don't let that stop you. The menu is diverse and delicious.

When they served the milkshake, they made sure to give you extra milkshake on the side because the glass was loaded up with toppings. The rim of the glass was covered in frosting and chocolate crunchies. On top there were chocolate cookie sticks and a chewy brownie. It's basically a meal in itself!! If you come in for dinner, I suggest you share the milkshake with someone else OR go for just the milkshakes.",

We had about 5 of us, that ordered a variety of food... probably totalling over $200.  Not only did it take about 40-minutes to get our order but most of the order was wrong.  I ordered potato chips w/ onion dip, a salad and a burger.  The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.  The salad, never happened... it was an order of pita chips and guacamole when I got back to my room.  The burger... I got the \"Gold Standard\" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.  I couldn't stomach the flavor and had to stop eating it after a few bites.  I seriously would have called to complain but I didnt have another 30-40 minutes for them to figure out a solution.  Probably wouldn't ever come back here because the service was horrible this night and the food was not worth the money.",

Uh not! Okay so I finally got seated and ordered something that I was really really looking forward to - a chocolate malt.  Well it was a letdown actually it was vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup and didn't even really have a good taste to it. Strike 2- I was excited about coming here. At this point, I'm hoping that the mushroom hamburger with cheese (the fun-ghi) that I ordered will be delicious and live up to all the reviews that I read.  The hamburger was good the fries were ...in a word marginal. I don't minds spending $30 on a decent dinner but two thirds of this dinner was not  really good -the malt pretty much sucked and  the fries - I've had  better and fast food restaurants.

    "text": "Went here with my fiance on our yearly vegas trip. It was loud because of the football playoffs being shown in the bar.  The fiance ordered an oreo shake, which was yummy. We ordered the truffle lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer. It was pretty good, but not the best I'd ever had. The blend of cheeses was nice and creamy, with a little sharpness, and the truffles really added to the dish. The lobster in the mac n cheese, however, did not taste like it was very high quality.  The fiance ordered the duck duck goose burger, which neither of us were very impressed with. He ordered a side of smashed potatoes, which were awful and completely inedible. They were cold and tasted like old dirty potatoes with no seasoning and no effort put into them.  I ordered the gold standard burger, which was honestly the saving grace of this restaurant. It was the best burger I've had in my life, and despite all the other problems we had with the food here, I would definitely go back for that burger. I ordered a side of duck fat fries. Not impressed at all. I've had better fries from in 'n out burger. I was really disappointed because I had heard that duck fat fries are supposed to be really good. I'm sure they are, just not at Holstein's.  We may go back the next time we're in Vegas just for the gold standard burger, but with so many other amazing restuarants in Vegas, maybe not.",

I understand that there's a club a few doors down, but having the DJ in the restaurant is obnoxious. A good restaurant to me does not include head pounding techno music, screaming at the people I'm with and barely being able to understand them even then. If you're into that, go for it. I'm guessing that it's not like that during the day and if it isn't I'd be willing to try it again.",

    "text": "Damn good burger.  Started with the fried pickle appetizer. They were delicious and came with a couple fried olives and caper berries and were served with proscuitto, and salamis on the side, a very tasty pairing. I had the Classic burger and my guest had the turkey sliders. My burger was perfectly cooked, juicy meat,  good bun and toppings, an excellent burger. At $13, it's on the expensive side, but not absurd for a place on the strip, and the quality was there. I tried half of one of the turkey sliders, good meat but a little boring, could use more dressing or the cucumber slaw it was dressed with.  Service was flawless, our waitress (Dani?) was friendly, answered all of our questions, kept our drinks full and was just a sweet heart. So far, Holsteins is the best burger I've found in Vegas. The room is VERY loud, both the music and the people. Don't go if you want to have an intimate conversation. You almost have to yell to the person across the table from you.",

It has clean modern high-end lines with fresh contemporary \"local?\" graffiti artist art work. It immediately grabbed my interest. The staff is friendly down to earth and looked like they were having fun. ( who wouldn't wearing hot jeans and chucks to work everyday ) . I was entertaining friends so we immediately ordered the appetizers that were perfect for everyone ( the foodies at the table and the overworked and just plain hungry) We had the duck tacos .... AMAZING and the crab mac and cheese .... to die for ! For lunch our table was impressed with the array of offerings. We had everything from burgers, the homemade sausages and salads. Every dish tasted better then then the last. THEN .... the best part of every ones day... THE CANDY STORE. You must order it. I don't want to ruin the surprise but everyone in the restaurant knows it is at your table. It is a sweet head turner that takes your breath away LITTER LY.  Holsteins Shakes and Buns made my day ! and I recommend it highly to anyone.",

The staff was very friendly and helpful but the food and beer selection really stole the spotlight. They have tons of craft beers on draft and in bottles. The burgers are incredible and they have quite an exotic variety to choose from. I had the regular beef burger which was cooked to perfection and my fiance said her veggie burger was the best she's ever had. The prices are very reasonable considering all the other dining options in the Cosmopolitan. Definitely my new favorite restaurant in Sin City!",

First being a popcorn lover, you can only imagine my excitement when the waitress dropped off some complimentary cheddar popcorn to start our meal!   Basically this place is the biz for its gourmet burgers and alcoholic shakes.  I went here twice in one day, that's how much I liked the burgers and shakes.  There's other stuff like truffle lobster mac n cheese and interesting snacks like pizza \"twinkies\", fried pickles, fried green tomatoes and kalbi beef with kimchee quesadillas.  They also have sliders as well.  I'll def. be back to try these.  I had the campfire smores shake and a taste of my friend's drunken monkey shake....both sooooo gooooood!    Rising sun- juicy meat and I surprisingly liked the combination.   Korean \"bull\"gogi- juicy meat, I liked the flavor of this.  If you like bulgogi, you'll love this. Gold Standard- so I thought this was kinda dry, plus I\"m not really into goat cheese so I didn't like it as much.  But my bro loved it. Burgers were pretty decent in size, I was stuffed after one and the guys were satisfied after theirs.  Burgers also come with a choice of shoestring fries or steak cut fries, both were deelish.  They also have a pretty decent stocked bar and a selection of beer that my fiance enjoyed.  These gourmet burgers are pricey, 13-17.5 bucks.  Shakes are around 11 bucks.  But it's Vegas and the food was great, so in that case I didn't mind!  I recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for some tasty burgers and shakes...",

Wait time usually isn't that bad, but you can make a reservation if you go on a busy weekend just in case.   They start you off with popcorn thats seasoned with something  imma just say those alcoholic shakes get me feelin some type of way nuff said, or i was just tired from EDC week   The first 2 times i was here i got the billionaire burger, foie gras anything i can't really resist. The only bad thing about this burger is it's like double the price of all their other burgers  The third time i came here i got the  crispy pork belly bun and that shit sooo good, unless you don't like fat, cus i bit into a fatty ass piece and just about died   I also got the ahi sliders, they're hella good too, nothing abnormal about them they're exactly what they sound like. even tho ahi mini tostadas would be more appropriate since they come on fried wonton wrappers  i probably should be talking shit about this restaurant and saying to go to burgr or some other sub par gourmet burger place so i can keep this location to myself, but i guess sharing is caring",

    "text": "This review (and rating) is only for the LATE NIGHT menu.  My bf and I arrived late at night and sadly they didn't offer their normal menu. We had to order from the \"late night menu\" which does NOT have a lot of their popular items. They don't even have their spiked milkshakes on the late night menu which was what I wanted to try the most after hearing so many good things about it. :( Booo.   My bf and I reluctantly ordered the tiny burgers which are really really tiny! Tinier than your average sliders. The meat was super dry too. I really do not recommend them. Their homemade potato chips that came on the side were tasty though. But overall, NOT worth the money!  There was a DJ inside near the entrance which was pretty odd/interesting... since nobody dances in there and it's not even really a lounge.. and it's right across from Marquee where you can go dance to a DJ if you wanted to.   All in all, do NOT come here late at night. Come during their regular hours so you can get the goods!",

    "text": "First thing, that catches your eye while wondering around the fabulous Cosmopolitan hotel is this restaurant. At first look, it might be just another trendy bar with cute graffiti decor (happy looking cows and chickens with smiles on their faces) but step in and look a little closer and you will realize that yes, this is a bar/lounge in the front but in the back it is a full fledged running restaurant with tables and table-booths!   We decided to stop by and try this place out before we left Vegas (le sigh it is always hard to part with such an awesome city). The hostess were very sweet and little ditsy but heck they made us laugh!  We were seated right away which was impressive at almost 5:30pm on a weekday. The lounge/bar area was busy and so was the restaurant.  We settled into our table-booth, which was comfortable even though we were sandwich in-between, two other parties, we were handed our menus. This place has almost everything you could ask for:  Shakes (bam -boozled shakes) IPA's Beer Wine One of a kind cocktails  But what I liked most was the free tin of freshly popped popcorn they bring to your table along with large ketchup and mustard bottles. Who knew that ketchup or mustard would taste so good on popcorn!  All their burgers are made to order and are fresh, natural with organic ingredients!  With so many options on their menu, it was hard to choose just one burger.   I decided on the Nom Nom Burger- No bun, Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing  I have to admit I was never the kind if girl to put potato chips or even fries on my burgers. I use to watch my friends do it and think it probably tastes weird! But screw that though I told myself I'm going in!  After ordering, it does take awhile and patience is a total virtue, that is when people watching takes place! And believe me it is a fun place to watch all the out of water tourists!  One guy was seated at a table next to us and was told he could not have his large hurricane glass at the table. You would have thought he was told that there was no strip clubs in Vegas! He tried to tell the hostess that he was not going to drink it, not believing him she told him that she would hold it up at the front for him. Still the look on his face was priceless!  Our burgers came out larger than life (or maybe that was my hunger talking) I had to try some of Minh's onion rings (which were delicious) I could have ate them all except I was given the \"eye\" so I swiped two more and went back to my burger!   It was the perfect burger, cheesy with just the right amount of dressing and chips! The burger was wonderful, full of flavor not a dry bite at all!  Be warned their burgers do fill you up fast, even though I opted not to have the bun I got full half way through! I forced myself to finish this epic burger, which I am 50/50 that I did. 50% happy because it was yummy, the other 50% was left being uncomfortable for a while as my burger settled in my tummy!   Service was great, and the prices were decent for being on the strip!",

It caught my eye right away, the second I was handed a menu in the adorably cartoon-ish dining room. You get the option to sit on these couches as well, but I like my tables to be a little higher than my knees.  My burger came out perfectly medium rare and the meat was this excellent quality. My burger tasted a little like a fancy In n Out burger, but with potato chips, which really weren't that weird in a burger. I wasn't the hugest fan of the cheddar, but everything else was great.  We weren't in the mood for an alcoholic shake, so we shared the birthday cake shake sans alcohol, which came with cake bits, vanilla ice cream, and sprinkles. Still delicious, even without alcohol.  Holsteins is definitely a gem!",

For example, a few minutes after it came to the table it started hitting on every guy there. Even Julian.  No standards.  I added a fried egg and I was happy about that. I ordered a caipirinha since they had a full bar and I was happy about that too. Kevin used up more ketchup than a family of six should use in any given month other than July. July is a month where most families of six use a lot of ketchup. Look it up.  The art on the walls might make a vegetarian feel a little bad. But if you're a vegetarian and you're eating at this place, you're kind of an idiot. Not for eating at this place. But for being a vegetarian. What's up with that?  Side note...the popcorn is pretty legit. Don't miss a chance to try it. It's free, too. So unless you just got sealants on your molars, you should dig in.",

Being a HUGE fan of burgers, I've been to many burger joints and restaurants, and have been searching for the perfect burger. Holsteins was pretty damn good, but not the top of the top.   I ordered the campfire s'mores shake, which is the most amazing shake I have ever had. The alcohol in the shake was very subtle, and the shake was just.. perfect. no other words.  The lobster mac and cheese- pieces of lobster with mac and cheese and truffle oil. As a big fan of truffle oil, this dish was perfect for me. So far, so good.  Then the burgers- the gold standard and the billionaire. I hate blue cheese, so had only regular cheddar cheese with the gold standard. It was a good burger, the ingredients were paired well and I was satisfied. The billionaire burger- wgayu and foie gras- was ok. Because foie gras was banned in California, it was a must that we got that burger. However, the burger was a bit dry, and did not meet up to par.   On the other hand, service was up to par, the lady was very nice and came around to check up on us often. I would definitely come back for Holsteins for the shakes, that was the highlight of the meal. For Vegas standards, this place is decently good, although I expected something better.",

It was $16.50 which is way too expensive for how small/not tasty it is. My friend ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken. The salad was $12, the chicken was $8. $8 for a small piece of grilled chicken?! Are you crazy?!  I'm never coming back here again.",

Pros:  - Creative, eye-catching decor - Alcoholic milkshakes - Interesting cocktail list - Decent burgers  Cons: - Very expensive (for a burger and fries) - Service is amateur (turnin' and burnin') - Server uniforms were so damn weird. We counted six different uniforms ranging from a dress shirt and tie to a girl wearing her underwear and a skin tight tank top...for such expensive food I thought the staff (and their uniforms) would be a little more cohesive - Slow service/food takes a long time  I think that two times was enough for us and we won't be back. Vegas is a Mecca of good food and service so unless something blows me away it's time to try something new.",

These are delicious !!!   From there, we went on and had a few apps on the menu. The Lobster Mac and Cheese, Lobster rolls, sliders, and the bruschetta. Everything was AMAZING except for the crab bruschetta. Took a small bite and passed the plate. The only think I would say about this is that the bartender didn't take it off our bill. We did state that it was not good and shouldn't be recommended to people but it's an $18 app so I guess upselling is where this came in. I'm going to continue on how great everything else was though. The Lobster Mac and Cheese and Lobster Rolls were dynamite ! The size of actual lobster in these small plates were terrific and so so good ! The mini sliders were great too ! The staff and bartender we had was really nice !   Highly recommend this place ! At least if you're passing by, just go for the shakes !",

I expected more out of the burger since it was one of the Top Choice/recommended burger since many always ordered it. To be honest, I think In-N-Out would be more satisfying and well worth my money. Spending roughly $18 wasn't worth for what it is.   I'd rather also go to Bachi Burger. The service here was okay. It took about 10-15 minute wait for my party of 7 to be seated. It was packed inside, but I mean what restaurant in Vegas isn't packed right? Nothing much to complain about them. As far as order whatever else. I'm not sure what else to pick since it's my first time here. I don't think id ever come back and or even crave their burgers.   I'm not saying you shouldn't come here, but id at least tell you to check it out if you're curious about this restaurant.",

My boyfriend ordered a pecan shake, it was okay, not the greatest BUT he also asked for no alcohol in his shake so I'm not sure if that altered the taste.  We started out with the lobster mac & cheese...to die for! Literally that, in itself, was the highlight of my visit. I would return just to order that.  I ordered the Steakhouse burger. It wasn't the best burger I've had...sadly, it wasn't close either. I'm a snob when it comes to burgers, but that's because I was raised in Texas, where the meat is organic, real, juicy grass-fed beef. The patty as Holstein's was mediocre at best. It lacked the natural flavor of a beef patty, even being cooked to medium-rare. It was dry and crumbly in my mouth. If it weren't for the other ingredients in my burger, I wouldn't have been able to eat it --- there was just a total lack of flavor and the texture wasn't pleasing to my taste buds.  I thoroughly enjoyed the french fries. I don't normally like fries, but these were thin, crispy and deliciously seasoned! My boyfriend got the sweet potato fries --- light with easy seasoning.  The service was GREAT! Another huge highlight of my visit. Our server was able to answer every question we had with great knowledge of the menu as well as what guests may or may not like.  Overall, I wouldn't return if I was craving a burger... But if a friend wanted to go, I'd go back for the lobster mac & cheese.",

    "text": "This was our first stop during our Vegas weekend and we grabbed a few things to share. Their menu is perfect for that since they have Nosh (apps) and Tiny Buns (sliders) on the menu in addition to full size dishes.  They start you off with a little bucket of popcorn and seems the flavor changes - the first time we had the Cajun...yum.  We had the Holsteins sliders which showed that this place makes some legit burgers, even in mini-size. The Ahi Poke Tostadas were tasty little bites of goodness - I could've eaten 2 orders had we not been trying to save ourselves for dinner! We also shared the Crispy Pork Belly Buns...I came back for more of these soft, Bao-like \"tacos\". The pork belly has a gorgeous crisp on the outside with a tender inside and is a perfect fit for the soft, fluffy bun. On the second visit, I ordered more of these along with their Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese. It was creamy with big chunks of lobster. The chip and lobster garnish was so good, it could be it's own dish. Maybe it's the lobster salad from the Lobster Rolls? And, since it was late morning, I tried the Spicy Bloody Mary which is made with a jalapeno cilantro infused vodka. Bold flavor with a lingering heat. The hubby got a Strawberry Shake that he thoroughly enjoyed.  We were sat quickly both visits. The second visit was Sunday morning during football so we opted to skip the $40 hourly charge for their bar tables...but there was a table in the back that had 2 TVs just no sound.   Service was good both visits. Food came out quick and hot.   If they could put a Holsteins into a Reno or Tahoe Casino, I would be a very happy carnivore! I've been to some incredible burger places lately and this is one I will definitely make a point to visit next time I am in LV!",

    "text": "This is our second visit to Helsteins. They don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday making it harder to plan to eat there before a show but we tried our luck and it was on our side. We were able to get a table without too much wait at about 6-6:!5 on a Saturday night. Opentable must have gotten an upgrade since I used it last and now it will text you when your table is ready, gotta love technology!   We of course had an alcoholic milkshake, we had the Cereal Bowl. YUM!   We got the friend pickles, which were so yummy. I love the spears and I love that the coating did not fall off after the first bit. The sauce they are served with was good as well. I had the California Turkey Burger, tomato, avocado, pepper jack, russian dressing. It was really good and so big. I could have finished it but I resisted! The BF got the Rising Sun and he said it was good, he finished it all. We also got Sweet Potato Fries, which can never be wrong.   The service was good and friendly and attentive.   My beef with this visit was that they allowed a completely inebriated guy and his friend dine in the restaurant. The manager kept an eye on him from a far but he was literally heaving as if he was going to be sick. Not what I want to see while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. They would have gotten 5 stars otherwise.     I'll be back and this time I will ask for my locals discount, which the hostess could have told me when I checked in and gave her my local phone number.",

    "text": "At close to 500 reviews for Holstein's, I guess I don't really need to add my opinion but what the hell.  I cannot come to Vegas without a stop at this restaurant. Seriously. I often wish that I had starved myself a little more before coming so that I could eat more. It's that good.  Let's start with their bam-boozled shakes. Shakes, yum. Add alcohol? Uh yes please. I've had the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka) the birthday cake (I think this might be new since I don't see it on their online menu. Think sprinkles, and bits of cake), and the drunken monkey (reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico). All amazing.  As for their food, I love their apps. Hello fried cheese curds, truffle lobster mac and cheese, and fried pickles served with fried caper berries, olives, and salami. Though I think their menu has changed. I got the fried pickles again this weekend and there were no other sides to the dish. I was a little sad about it.  Okay, now for the main course. The burgers. I'm already drooling... The Rising Sun burger is still one of my favorites. Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. Wow. No really, wow. The Hen House burger? Delicious but nothing super fancy. The Korean Bull'gogi burger is yum. I'm a sucker for a fried egg and kimchi and this burger has both as well as chili mayo. And last but not least (for the beef burgers anyway), the Gold Standard burger. Beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. You can't be serious.  Don't worry vegan/vegetarians, there's something for you too. They have a vegan burger which actually sounds pretty tasty and There is a wonderful salmon burger called Captain Hook. The salmon is thick and moist and comes with pickled shallots, caper herbed mayo, and house cured gravlax. Salmon on salmon. I won't say no.  All burgers are served with a side and I love their shoe string fries. Crispy, thin and perfectly salted for my taste.  At this point, if you still care about the ambience and the service, here it is. I like both. The restaurant is nice but not overly fancy.  Service is prompt and friendly but not overbearing.   After writing this review, I'm tempted to jump in my car and drive down there just for the food. I wish I was kidding...",

We had the s'mores and the chocolate with vodka. At $15 apiece (because they were not the happy hour specific shakes) they are grossly overpriced. The burgers were nothing special. Both were over cooked for medium rare and the barmaid couldn't have given a shit about service. The \"gold standard\" should be \"the lame and predictable\". For $18 definitely not worth the money. They also list a Kobe burger on the menu. I don't think it really was, but anytime you over cook a burger it destroys the integrity. I will not go back.",

I tried 2 burgers: the greek lamb burger with tzatiki sauce so tasted like a gyro burger and the machete, with a unique mexican flair and great toppings. Burger are around 14 to 18 bucks, come with a huge portion of fries (there ok) so prices very reasonable. Burgers I would equate to fuddruckers size, so pretty good (1/2 pounders I think) Great find in cosmo, a little off the beaten path, gotta look for it upstairs past the ballroom carpets and shit, but well wortth it.",

You can't even tell there is alcohol in the shakes thats how good they taste.  You will get the shakes in the old school shake glass and a little extra on the side in the stainless steal mixing tumbler. The burgers were good, but would recommend that you order them med. rare because when they come off the grill they will still be cooking.  We ordered medium thinking pink inside well they were a little on the well side.  However, they were still tasty.   As for the price well things are on the higher side.  For two people you can expect to pay about 65$ for just burgers and shakes.  The burgers come with regular fries but you can upgrade to the sweet potato fries or the onion rings.  We didn't order any appetizers but they say the dill pickles are a hit. Definitely a place to stop and try if any for the shakes.",

    "text": "To say that Holstein's is incredible is an understatement.   I have had a few burgers from Holstein's, and each burger is beyond phenomenal. This is one of the few restaurants that offer a gluten free bun, let alone a gluten free bun that is delicious, so when I found out they had this option we immediately ran to this restaurant without passing go. Add on the fact they have spiked milkshakes, and I am all set to go.  The three burgers I've had at Holstein's are:  Burger of the Day: Short Rib Burger This burger had huge chunks of melt in your mouth short rib that made everything seem right in the world.  Gold Standard Burger: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli   This burger should be the first burger you eat at Holstein's. Everything about it is right. You'd think a burger with that many ingredients would be overwhelming, but it's not. No wonder this burger has gotten them several well-earned awards. Everyone we know that has come to Holstein's with us has loved this burger.  Captain Hook Burger: Grilled Atlantic Salmon w/Frissee, Pickled Shallots, Herb-Caper Mayo & House Cured Gravlax   To be quite honest, I don't know what Gravlax is, but whatever it is I love it and will go back to Holstein's to eat it whenever my waistline can bear it. The salmon was cooked perfectly: tender in the inside with a buttery crust on the outside and definitely not greasy. If you're looking for a lighter option instead f a burger, this is the way to go.  Go here. You will love every bite. If you have a gluten allergy or not, you will be able to eat their regular french fries (natural cut and good, but nothing life altering) or their sweet potato fries which are a delicious treat in a world that rarely gets sweet potato fries right. If you're looking for less fried, go with the coleslaw. So, so good. Eat up and enjoy!",

They give you a small bucket with French fries to make the burger seem much larger than it actually is, but once you pick it up it's about the size of something off the dollar menu at McDonald's. The decor was a mix of nice restaurant and tacky paintings of cows during the final bookaki scene. It was quite disturbing. I also found it odd the hostess was wearing a nice black dress and the waiters wore button downs and black ties but the female bartenders were dressed for a pedophiles paradise, with hot pink short, knee high socks, sneakers and blue v-neck t-shirts. Their only redemption is the Their decent vegan burgers and large milk shakes. I wouldn't suggest this place",

If you like spice, go with the machete burger. The vegan patty was flavorful and crunchy on the outside.",

The macaronis were tiny little noodles. Chef boyardee style noodles. Not enough lobster and def not enough cheese.  Fried pickles were exactly what it was. Not a fan.  Calamari was actually tasty. Not the traditional with sauce on the side. It was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slices of jalapenos!  The gold standard burger was ok. Supposedly the best burger in Vegas but not to my standard. I asked for medium and it came out well done. It was too charred. Only tasted the burnt meat. The idea of the burger was awesome with aged goat cheese and arugula but that's it. Just the idea was great.   I wouldn't dine here. It's not worth the money and experience.

Stopped by around 11 am on a Sunday (when they start serving lunch) after a long flight to get to LAS.  On the second floor at the Cosmo, and easy to find.    Decent seating, you do not feel as if you are on top of each other when seated.   Just two of us; we ordered the signature / classic burger, which is an 8 oz burger and really good.  I ordered mine without the bun, so they placed it on a small salad (see my pic).   The onion rings were great, nice and crisp.

Wasn't too strong so still tasted like dessert. Plus the addition of frosting on the outside...yummm!!   Also got a burger and honestly not sure which one it was but it was perfectly cooked and a good fresh hardy bun. Always disappointed when I get a wimpy bum that falls apart but not here.   Also it was crazy busy and we had great service. Truly impressed because we had a very large group and they treated us great.   Definitely worth putting on your list.",

We ended up having a large and late lunch, so we were looking for something to hold us over until morning.   We shared- Truffle fries Wings  Caesar salad with chicken.   The first two items were bomb. Flavorful and cooked well.   I would pass on the salad. The greens were way too earthy for my liking. I felt like I was eating little trees. The chicken also cost an extra 8 dollars, so that salad was a grand total of 20 dollars. It definitely was not worth that.   Our server was very kind and awesome at filling our waters, since I apparently drink like a camel in Vegas.",

She let me know that the Impossible veggie burger's bun was not vegan (I think she just assumed I was vegan and informed me anyway), as well as the patty being cooked on shared equipment. She even went off on a (good) tangent and talked about must-try vegan spots around town. I really respect employees that recommend other businesses when the situation calls for it!  She recommended the Quinoa Salad, which was probably the best I've ever had. It was reasonably priced as well, especially for being located on the Strip. If anything, I'd definitely come back for the service!",

The shake was incredible. I got the cookies and creme to share with the three of us and I was surprised by how big the shake was. It came with an ice cream sandwich! The shake tasted delicious and there was plenty of boozy goodness to go around between us.  For food, we ordered the cheese curds to start and they were perfect. I would have liked a second portion of marinara standard instead of the mustard that came with it but it was good. One order along with the popcorn to start was enough to satisfy the hunger beast a little.  My seared tuna salad was delicious! For my personal taste there was a little too much dressing on it, but this was a mistake on my part - I forgot most places tend to overdress the salad. Aside from that, the tuna was delicious and I highly recommend getting this if you're looking for something green to eat.  Overall I'd recommend this place but the service and food can be a little slow, hence knocking 1 star off. They seem like they're always busy so bring some patience and maybe enjoy a milkshake while you wait for your food.",

I think it might just be that any single parties are immediately offered the bar or lounge area.    My server was EXCELLENT. She was attentive and not overbearing.  I asked for suggestions and I was pleased with her recommendations.  I wish I had some friends with me so that I could have ordered the Parmesan fries without feeling like a glutton. I ordered the Waygu burger with the \"built in\" mushrooms and the poached egg , a side Caesar, and small sweet potatoes fries. The food was good.  My only recommendation is that they consider a softer bun. Honestly, I enjoyed the Caesar and the fries better than the burger.  That might be because I'm going through a weird phase with meats in general. I'm NOT an aspiring vegetarian or anything, I'm just becoming more selective with grades of meat, particularly beef.    Overall the experience was a good one and I'd eat here again. If I did, I'd order the Caesar (no protein.",

I had to get the gold standard burger, which came with a dry aged beef sirloin patty, smoked goat chedder cheese, tomato confit, smoked bacon, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. I also couldn't resist the side order of fries and mac and cheese!  I ordered my burger medium rare and disappointingly, it came out almost well done. The smoked bacon was also a difficult bite and tasted like it was left on the griddle for too long. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors of the burger but couldn't get past the dryness of the patty, which would've been avoided altogether had it been cooked as requested.  I did enjoy the fries that were cooked perfectly to my preference - fluffy inside and a nice crisp on the outside! The mac and cheese was creamy, cheesy, and flavorful. I appreciate the base of a nice and thick roux for mac and cheese.   Overall, I found my meal satisfactory but given the many options of food nearby, I don't think I would come back when I can have amazing meals elsewhere.",

Great selection of craft beers being a local I'm not a fan of dining on the strip. My focus is strictly seeking out Vegas gems the strip is for our visitors. However, it's a holiday weekend and Holsteins location is a great place to have a wonderful conversation a great burger and spirited refreshing craft beer while doing some interesting people watching. My friend ordered the Salmon burger he said he loved it. I chalk this up to my one yearly visit to the strip.

Being regarded as the best burger in Vegas, I think my standards may have been high to begin with.   The shakes themselves are impressive though and can definitely pass as a full meal. Some of our friends got a shake that came with a full ice cream sandwich on top. Definitely not a place for the health conscious.   As for the burger, I ordered the Gold Standard which is a dry aged sirloin burger with varying accoutrements such as smoked bacon, arugula, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, and garlic/chive aioli. I ordered it cooked to medium and they did just that. The burger comes alone and will run you around $18. Although it was cooked to medium like my friends, we all agreed that it was quite dry. It might be due to the dry aging of the beef but I want my burgers juicy and it did not deliver on that part. Aside from that, the pairings were okay but the burger as a whole did not wow me.",

I ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad. I loved it!!  The tuna was perfect. The wontons added a nice crunch and I always love edamame beans. I also tasted a bite of the waygu my friend ordered it was cooked perfectly.   We didn't order dessert, but the shakes looked amazing. One was topped with a huge chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.   I definitely would go back. I want to give 4.5.",

I had to order the overpriced $32 Billionaire burger. I don't know where else I would get this in Vegas.  I know it wasn't worth $32, the burger itself is amazing. It's not balanced by any means. It's oily and rich. The truffle mayo, foie gras, and medium rare wagyu beef juices dripped down my plate. But I made sure my burger picked back those juices up.  The burgers do not come with fries. You have to order them separately. It's a big portion. Hope you have other people to help you eat them.   The boozy milkshake was actually really good. Very over the top and extra, but...screw it; you're in Vegas!   The beers are pricey. Expect to pay $9-11 dollars for one. I would totally go back here again to try a different menu item. 4/5 because it's kind of expensive.   Overall, I recommend coming here.",

I initially came to the Cosmo with the intentions of going to EggSlut, but the line was too long, so we ended up at Holsteins!   Boy was I glad that we didn't go to EggSlut, because this restaurant was amazing! To start off the dining experience, they serve you complimentary popcorn at your table. There were various entrees to choose from, I couldn't even decide at first! My boyfriend and I both ended up getting the rising sun with sweet potato fries. The burger was so delicious and a large portion size for me. I couldn't finish it. The burger is made with wagyu beef and tempura avocado with spicy mayo! Honestly so good!   Next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely pay a visit here.",

We got seated quickly and ordered the cookies n cream shake along with a specialty cocktail which was a berry pina colada. Both were delicious! The cookies n cream shake came with an entire cookie ice cream sandwich on top, truly amazing and fun.   We did order the philly cheesesteak egg rolls which were cheesy and flaky. The only thing that we weren't too happy with is that our appetizer was served and not even 5 minutes later our entrees came, it was a little rushed.  Beside that, the fries, burgers, milkshakes, were awesome. The restaurant is open with fun cow decor and complimentary popcorn to each table. It is located right next to Marquee dayclub so great people watching! Pricing is decent, about $25 per person, a great casual spot or either lunch or dinner.",

Limited to bar and lounge seating.   Got a spot at the bar and met bartender Kenny. Business has a great selection of boozy milkshakes. Social Hour menu included sharable dishes like egg rolls, sliders and buffalo chicken dip.  Items are priced well.  Milkshakes were huge! Ordered a Drunken Money with candy and taffy decorating the outside. Easy to split this shake with a friend.   Also ordered sliders and buffalo chicken dip. Kenny didn't steer us wrong. The dip is great! A must have!  Order was quick to arrive. Fresh and yummy! Interested in exploring more of this menu on  a future visit.",

    "text": "I don't usually go to gourmet burger places because it's just a hamburger, but this place really takes burgers to the next level. The ambiance is pretty intimate with dim lighting, but also has a casual vibe to it too so you aren't pressured to dress fancy like some Vegas restaurants make you do.   For our table, we got the smores and chocolate chip cookie milkshake (no alcohol so it was $12 instead of $15), al pastor burger, rising sun burger, and truffle fried grilled cheese. The shakes were hands down the best shakes I ever had and they look so elaborate and appealing. Honestly, one shake is enough for 2-3 people. It's huge! The al pastor burger was amazing! The layers of flavor and textures blew my mind. The burger was cooked perfectly (very juicy), the al pastor had a nice marinade to it, and the pineapple was a nice sweet, acidic contrast. The only downside was that I didn't feel more burger was seasoned enough. I know it's not a huge deal, but some more salt would have elevated all those flavors in my burger. The water from the pineapple definitely could have diluted some of the saltiness so adding a bit more salt would help. The rising sun burger was interesting. I liked the idea of a tempura avocado. I never saw that so that was cool, but I think the al pastor burger was better. The fried truffle grilled cheese was very cheesy, gooey, and crunchy. Great flavor and texture contrast throughout. Along with the dipping sauce, you can really taste the truffle flavor! It is amazing!   Lastly, the service here was absolutely spot on. Our waiter was available when we needed him, continually refilling our waters, and making sure we were taken care of. Since going, I been telling all my friends about this place. It's fun, friendly, and delicious!",

    "text": "The burgers and boozy shakes are a MUST here (hence, the name)! When we arrived at around 10:30 pm, the place wasn't packed at all (I was told night life begins really late in Vegas) and my boyfriend and I were seated in a nice corner by ourselves. The decor was really creative and modern, and the couches were comfortable to sit in.   Our waiter was very welcoming and nice, and he provided us with recommendations on what to eat. I went with the rising sun burger (about $18) and a cookies and cream and boozy shake ($15, which comes with the most delicious chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich) and I loved it! So much flavor in that rising sun burger, given it has flavors characteristic of sushi and Japanese food (since it has the teriyaki and spicy mayo and tempura avocado). The meat was cooked more on the well-done side versus medium-well that I asked for, but I totally did not mind. Awesome burger!!  Now, for the best part- the boozy shake! Man, the cookies and cream was such a delight and they even bring you extra ice cream shake in a tin, so you get a lot of bang for your buck, in my opinion. I got a few sips of the grasshopper shake, as well, and it is incredible (if you like mint ice cream, get it!)! The shakes have the perfect combination of sweet with some alcohol and yummy treats they cover the shakes in (like chocolate crispies, whipped cream, other desserts, etc.), so take your time reading all the different kinds to find the one that suits your taste best.   Overall, I would say the price we paid for the food we got was worth it! And they have military discount so I was able to get 15% off my check. It was a great experience, the service was excellent, and the time it took the bring out the food was just right- they were pretty quick with everything. Would definitely come again!",

I kept my order simple: the gold standard burger with a chocolate shake. Despite being quite busy, my order came out surprisingly fast.   I have to say it exceeded my expectations. I asked for medium and got medium - a nice juicy pinkish red throughout the patty. This burger has lots of flavor and every bite was satisfying. It comes with fries that were okay, but compared to the high quality of the burger, it didn't really match. Kind of reminded me of Burger King fries from the 90's.  To wash that all down, I had the chocolate shake. It was quite good, but Vincent (from the movie Pulp Fiction) would have lost his marbles on a $9 milkshake, lol. It is a normal size (16-20oz) and good for one person, so really overpriced in my opinion.  TL;DR - great burger, meh fries, good shake.",

Outstanding burgers, fries, onion rings and atmosphere. They could get more creative on their burger choices, but you can't go wrong with the gold standard and then top it with a fried egg, onion ring, etc. The only complaint I had in my most recent visit was the meat. It was a bit chewy and dense - definitely packed too firm, or the quality of meat wasn't up to par for a $20 burger. Most people probably wouldn't complain. Overall a great burger and value for being in Vegas.  If you want a big treat, try one of the specialty milkshakes (without liquor they're $12). The presentation of the cookies & milk shake was something out of a magazine. Until next time Holsteins!",

I would have gotten it...but sadly I'm lactose intolerant and I was already taking a chance by getting a regular milkshake haha... The burgers come out pretty fast, but the milkshakes take awhile to make. They give some pretty tasty complimentary popcorn, it has a sort of Cajun seasoning on it.

It's huge and super filling so it's good if you have someone to share it with!   -gold standard burger // delicious! The patty was thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked (medium rare).

I have always had a tough time making it to restaurants when the Vegas world is literally your buffet (I typically eat only at buffets in Vegas... and now that I've explained my joke, it is no longer funny, if it even was to begin with).   But I am really happy to have made it to this place.   First, the restaurant itself is nice - very modern design and you look out on to a good people-watching concourse with a cool chandelier bar (a bar inside a chandelier) right outside.   But wow did the food blow me away. The burger was top notch, cooked perfectly, and each topping added to the experience. But the star of the show truly was the milkshake. I ordered a chocolate deal. First, it comes with overflow milkshake in the metal cup that I always appreciate. But second, it was loaded to the brim, and literally beyond, with good stuff. There were chocolate straws, a brownie, a chocolate bar, and the outside was glazed with additional chocolate bits. It was incredible. And they do have alcoholic shakes too!  Holsteins is THE burger place to visit in Vegas, bar none.",

We ordered the egg rolls and a side of sweet potato fries. I was presently surprised that both were super delicious!  They even put popcorn on the table to snack on before the food arrives. The food came out quick and service was excellent. All in all a choice for food in the Cosmo.",

I love everything about this place, including the wall murals which include such images as a beef patty in a bikini (complete with better cleavage and lashes than most humans I've met) and a Spiderman/pickle figure of some kind (you're gonna look for it now when you go, aren't you?).   The milkshakes are unreal. They offer some off-the-menu milkshakes as well which you should surely ask your server about. The night we went they were offering a cake doughnut milkshake that sounded like as good of a poor decision as any in Vegas, nahdamean? We opted for the cookies and cream shake and were elated when it came out topped with a giant ice cream cookie. Best part - each shake comes overflowing with toppings and served with the leftovers that don't fit in the fancy glass on the side - great for sharing (the rest of the group at our table really appreciated it).   As a self-proclaimed burger snob, I'll gladly give this place my seal of approval on all things beef patty related. The Golden Standard and the Fungi burgers are out of this world - give them a shot. I opted for regular fries but they have a sweet potato option that looked pretty good as well.",

Their shakes come either with alcohol ($15) or without ($12), and are definitely big enough to share between 2-3 people. The presentation is beautiful, and they are super rich - the shake we got (cookies and cream) had a huge double chocolate chip ice cream sandwich on top, as well as vanilla frosting, and Oreo crumbs. The shake itself was creamy and delicious, and they even gave the shaker with the extra shake inside. Totally worth the money for the presentation and the experience.",

Looking forward to the birthday cake shake and red velvet shake and they are off the menu. Totally bummed about this since been looking forward to those.   Previously their shakes comes with an extra portion since it doesn't fit in their glass. They do not do that anymore. So for the $15 you pay you get less.   I always get the fun-guy burger and my husband gets the rising star - they are not as juicy as before. We order medium - it was cooked medium but not juicy.   We will still go back next time we visit LV hoping this is just a fluke.",

I could not decide between the $18 dollar US steak burger or the $18 Wygu burger. I went with the US burger.    The burger was almost cold when it came and it was so tough to eat that I took it out of its dried out bun and used a knife and fork to be able to cut it.  The bun is not suited to the job at hand and the condiments were marginal.  They served the salad after the burgers which turned out well so I got something to eat.  I left almost one half of that expensive burger on the plate, yet when the sever removed it he did not ask me if anything was wrong with the burger.  Whenever a server removes a plate full of food it should be obvious that there is a problem.  The milk shake was not like any that I have had before. It was rich but not refreshing.  As I drank the uber sweet drink I thought that they should have gone with the old fashioned ice cream and milk approach.   The decor is very nice and handsome.    Personally, next time I am going back to Fatburger across the street and have a much better burger for less than half the price.",

It is a burger house, however, came here for the shake to see if the claims on Travelocity were as bold as users said they were. I had two shakes: Vanilla and Strawberry. To judge a shake place you have to start at the basic and then go for the second choice. The Vanilla shake was nice and thick and there was good flavor, however, it tasted like any other shake. This isn't to say that I don't enjoy my shakes, however, there were a lot of bold claims made and thus I had higher expectations. I am not going to use the user reviews of Travelocity and the fact that I wasn't overly blown away affect this review as this is not fair. Just don't expect to be blown out of this world. I will say though for what it is independently it is a damn good shake. The customer service was super fast and friendly and the prices were very fair for something near the Strip. I appreciated how our waitress went the extra mile to be extra chatty with us. We have met so many amazing people in Vegas that this was just the tip of the ice burg or in this case, the cherry on the shake. I didn't catch her name but hopefully she remembers my best friend and I.",

You might think a party of two is okay being shoved into a tiny table in the corner but you should ask (is this okay? Or would you rather wait for another booth or full size table?) I get so pissed when restaurants dont take that into consideration. Especially, when the next party of two gets seated at the larger table across from you. Patrons take their experiences and they way they feel treated seriously and restaurants should treat it as such, it's a package deal.   First thing was we wanted to order the fried pickles and nope sorry we don't have them. We ordered the Buffalo chicken dip and it was good but I wasn't crazy about the chips that came with it, but it was still good. We ordered the spicy burger and I was really disappointed and agree with one of the other reviews that said it wasn't the best burger they ever had and it wasn't close it either. We ordered a boozie shake Coffee and Dounuts with a $3 extra shot and it was delicious, probably the best part of the whole meal. The food was not worth the price and I would only come back for the boozie shake but probably won't.",

It's kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. It was SO GOOD. It was so different and fresh tasting. I think I'd get this burger every single time I came here. I highly recommend this place.",

As the last burger option on their menu, the Billionaire Burger ($32) is phenomenal even for the price. My first bite into the Kobe beef and foie gras had my brain screaming \"ERMAGERD THIS BURGER IS SO GOOD!\". I try to savor each bite so that the burger lasts longer, yep I enjoy it that much.   Holstein's also offers a wide range of 'alcoholic' milk shakes with creative names - ie. Drunken Monkey. The portion is so large, they pretty much give you two full glasses for one order.   Service has always been friendly and quick - splitting bills has never been an issue. The attentive service and delicious burgers definitely have me coming back each time I visit Sin City!",

Plus I like how they text me when it's ready.  We didn't order any appetizers since we already drank so much.  We just wanted the burgers.  The waitress was nice and told us that the kitchen was backed up so we weren't angry about the wait.  It was also nice that the meals came with complimentary pizza-flavored popcorn to munch on while you're waiting.  Rising Sun:  It was awesome.  A nice juicy slap of meat on my bun with some terriyaki sauce, spicy mayo, and crispy yams for a nice crunch.  Only complaint is that I hate how fried avocado taste like.  The texture wasn't smooth or anything.  I would have preferred a fresh slice instead.    I can't wait for them to open one up at South Coast Plaza and try their $30+ burger.  Hell yeah!",

Specifically: we started with fried pickles. They were tasty and fried. (Hard to mess up anything deep fried lol) we swapped out the caper dressing for ranch. But there were other options available.   I ordered the Urth burger- the patty itself wasn't the greatest. It was okay as far veggie patties go, but seasoning wise...meh. The toppings were amazing though. The Urtha burger came with avocado, sprouts, TWO slices of tomato, lettuce and cucumber. I added Provalone cheese, but the list if options was pretty good (read: egg, salmon,  brisket, cheeses etc).   My husband ordered the Nom Nom Burger medium, seemed slightly rarer than medium, so order up of your usual. He added and over easy egg toping and found it quite delicious.   Service was good! Everyone was friendly and nice about switching menu items (ie gluten free buns for white, cheddar for American etc)",

However after I asked the waitress about it she said they didn't. She went to check anyways and found out they did indeed actually have them. I just got a plain basic burger with a gluten free bun as to not make it more complicated about which add ons are gluten free or not. And to be honest, I did not feel very reassured by the waitress who seemed to go back and forth about what I could eat or not eat. She said that none of the sides are gluten free but they could do a salad for me. Great. Except I found out later that the salad was an extra $3 that she hadn't mentioned. I would have just gotten no side. I also got their vegan adult shake, which I was told is gluten free. I also can't have dairy so it was fun to actually have a shake.   Their burger was okay. My gluten free bun and my SO's regular bun both were falling apart as we were eating. I think they got too soggy. It also took us the longest time to get refills on our water and for my SO to get his beer. He ordered it first thing and he didn't get it till after the food arrived. The food took a long time too. The vegan shake was good (but get it without the soy whipped cream, that stuff is nasty). We won't be returning here. If you are looking for a gluten free burger I would try the Burger Bar over by Mandalay Bay.",

I got the Urth burger and it was bland and dry.  Took a bite of the Rising Sun and the patty was tasteless and dry also.  The tempura avocado did nothing texturally.  The fries were the worst fries I've ever had at a sit down burger restaurant.  I'm seriously confused about the 5-star reviews but chacun a son gout.",

I know it might be counterintuitive for a vegan to come to Holsteins but I came with my family (non-vegan) and this was one of the only places on the strip that advertised a \"vegan\" something. HOWEVER, this place is NOT vegan friendly. Their \"vegan\" patties are fried in oils/lard that has been used to fry meats.   So... beware vegans/vegetarians!! Come to Holsteins and enjoy your green side salad without dressing (of course).... and then go find an actual vegan friendly place.",

    "text": "Holstein's is located on the food level (2) of the Cosmopolitan hotel on the Las Vegas strip. When we went Saturday evening, it was crowded but not terribly so. You have the option of sitting at the bar or waiting for a spot. Since the bar was full, we went onto the list. I liked that they text your mobile phone when your table is ready. This allowed us to walk around and take in the sights of the hotel a little bit.  I ordered the Rising Sun burger along with a Hoppy Lager (on tap) from Sierra Nevada. The burger was delicious. The lager was pretty decent too - they did seem to run out of some other SN options early, though - my previous 2 beer selections were both sold out.   In any event, I enjoyed the meal. My wife ordered the Ahi Tostados, a decent and interesting dish. We also shared the Truffle Lobster Mac&Cheese, which was exquisite.   All in all, the total came to about $60 - hey, what do you expect when you're on the strip? Worth the trip if you are in Vegas and don't want to get too fancy. Yes, it's pricey, but so is everything else.",

It's uncomfortable, but the wait seams to take forever here.   Ordered the Steakhouse Burger.  Something on the Burger smelled terrible, like \"rotten feet\". I could barely get it down, and I wished I hadn't, as I paid the price all night.  Stomach had been in pain and just bloated and burning.  I scraped off the cheese, as I thought that was it (although it said Swiss), so it must have been the marmalade or mushrooms.   If you have a sensitivity to specific foods, I'd suggest you question the staff.  I have no food allergies, so this doesn't happen very often. Just with super rich foods like all the stuff they piled on the burger.   The onion rings were basic, shake was ok.  Server at bar was awesome, so extra star for that.  They have only 1 bathroom inside, and the \"hot\" water did not work after letting it run for 2 minutes...pretty sure that's not up to code.   Prob won't be back if I can help it.",

I almost spoiled my appetite cause of them.   I got their jalapeno margarita? I forgot the name, but it was really good. The slight spicy flavor went well with the margarita. The boyfriend got their Coffee &Donut adult milkshake. I super liked it. Wasn't crazy sweet and perfect amount of booze.   We ordered the Gold Standard burger and Lobster Mac&cheese. The burger was delicious. Beef was nice and moist and their bacon inside was slightly glazed I think. The Mac&cheese was also yummy. They give you a good chunks of lobster and it's super creamy. We ended up eating the rest back at the hotel later that night. Used jalapeno kettle chips as scoops because we didn't have forks. The combo is amazing.   Hopefully, I'll try the longhorn or steakhouse burger next time.",

The restaurant was located a few steps from the elevators which also provided a visual reminder for us every time we passed it.  Our party started off lunch with some spicy Bloody Mary's.  They were actually a little WAY too spicy it felt like you drank some fire - the heat crazy lingered.  They also have a pretty amazing beer selection. The server cracked me up when I asked him for an IPA suggestion - this guy said their Sierra Nevada \"Holiday Blend\" was what he'd recommend.  Uhmmmm....So I went with the Green Flash IPA instead.  I also had a taste of the Tenaya Creek Hop Ride IPA - both VERY tasty ales.  MmmHmmm.  The server also brought out some Salt and vinegar popcorn for us to munch on. I haven't ever had these and gobbled them up to say the least.    I didn't eat any burgers this time around but had their Crispy Pork Belly Buns.  These were tasty and hit the spot.  Other members of our party had burgers though: the Big Fat Greek for one.  It was big AND fat - looked tasty too. If only I ate lamb *sigh*  Definitely coming back to check out their burgers - prob settle for a turkey burger.  The service was good and prices adequate for a Vegas restaurant.  I especially liked their artwork around the place.  It was artsy youthful and featured a comical cow all throughout.  What a way to lighten up the fact that you're going to soon scarf down one of 'em...",

Love the cool decor and paintings they have here, the music is really loud and it's cold in there so bring a jacket. Now on to the food, I got the lobster rolls which comes with a good portion size of 2 buns filled with yummy lobster and coleslaw inside and the mini buns are toasted. The boyfriend got the \"gold standard\" because the waiter convinced him that this was their most popular burger and boy did he love it...he loved the bacon, the dry aged beef and the baby arugula with it. The fries that it came with were also really good. Prices are decent with the amount of food they gave.

We went with some Lobster Mac and Cheese for an app and it was decent, not the best I've ever had but not bad.   For my burger, I ordered the Gold Standard and it was pretty good. I liked the arugula with the goat cheese and bacon, all the flavors worked well together. I had fries with my burger which were delicious. Mike ordered the El Machete which he liked as well. Mike ordered onion rings with his burger which were some of the best onion rings I've ever had, crispy and had a nice snap so it didn't pull out the whole onion when you took a bite. I really like the buns they use at Holsteins, nice and soft but holds up to all that burger and toppings. The burgers here are massive, we wanted to try some desserts but were way to full to even attempt.  I love the decor and set up of this place, they have cute little characters everywhere and pretty cool art. Its nice and open and the service is pretty good as well.

The lobster Mac was ok.  I didn't get much truffle flavor and I thought the lobster itself was a bit chewy but I will give them credit for including a lot of lobster meat.  Each of these appetizers was $16 or so for portions that were no more than a few bites, which I can understand for the lobster but not for the others.  Ultimately we paid $50 and left hungry, which I felt was kind of a rip off.",

    "text": "Ever since my Yelp buddy, Harmonie T. enticed me with her review of Holstein's, I've been excited to sample a little slice of Vegan goodness in the center of the strip.  After a combination of a mono-rail excursion, then a little bit of street hiking (shout out to Eugene L) along with good ol' fashioned Casino hopping, we arrived at the fancy-hip casual dining of Holstein's. Was it worth the trip? Eh not so much...  The Urth Burger itself was quite tasty. It had the faint flavor of a Thanksgiving Day stuffing. I actually liked it by itself. Unfortunately the thick bun, and toppings overwhelmed the flavor of the main ingredient. It's not bad by any means, it's just nothing special.  The thick cut fries that came with it were very good. Crisp & well seasoned, you can't ask for much more in a deep fried slice of potato. Unfortunately the Sweet Potato Fries that we ordered on the side came out cold as if they had been sitting out until we ordered them.   When our waitress was asked to replace them with a fresh order, all service was halted to our table after she brought out a much better tasting fresh batch. She refilled the water glasses at the table next to us, while leaving mine nearly empty. She didn't offer to refill it until she brought the check at the end of the meal. By then we were ready to go.  With a mediocre burger, piss poor service, and lack of a Vegan shake (No more Guava Float according to the waitress) to match the tasty looking alcoholic milkshakes that piqued my interest, I would rather hop on The Deuce to find better Vegan options elsewhere.",

I like the decor with the weird art and they also have a bunch of growlers on display which they sale too. It's a lot smaller inside then I thought and for some reason, I thought the seats were super uncomfortable.   Anyway, I went with the Rising Sun and my wife went with an Urth burger substituted with beef instead of a veggie patty. That's one cool thing...they will let you do pretty much anything you want with the burgers, mix & match or whatever. The burger itself is juicy but pretty plain in flavor. Both burgers had a good amount of toppings but since the meat is so plain, it's all you can taste. My burger did have a tempura avocado on it though and that on it's own was killer!  For the price, I really expected more. They up-charge $2 to swap your fries for onion rings or sweet potato fries and neither of those were worth that. We also got a Drunken Monkey shake that seems to be really popular...it was ok but $11 is crazy especially since we ordered it \"virgin\". All in all, everything was just ok and the service wasn't terrible but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",

I tried the steakhouse burger with blue cheese and it was heaven in my mouth! I absolutely loved the flavors and it's probably one of the best burgers I've had thus far. One thing I would like to suggest is for them to be about to customize your burger more. Adding a protein style option with no bread, or option to make burgers in to salads.  I definitely would take a lot of the burgers and turn them in to salad. Saves me from filling up on the bread.",

I had the Greek burger which had fantastic flavor in the lamb,  highly recommend everyone to try.

I,m not a big dude neither she had the Steakhouse Burger and I had the one that comes with potatoe chips on it, fries and a soda and a non-alcholic milkshake. All which tatsed good.

The service was standoffish, and though we ordered the things that were recommended in other reviews, I think we all walked away feeling like we were missing something.   Actually, to be honest, my choice, the Rising Sun burger, was probably at about a four star. It was an interesting combo of avocado, crispy yam strips, furikake, and teriyaki sauce, However, the selections that my dining partners got hovered at about two stars... or maybe even lower. One of my friends got the lobster roll and proclaimed it the worst she'd ever had.   Those who got the steak fries seemed to enjoy them, but I got the shoestring fries and found them to be cold and a bit stale tasting. Apparently the shakes were mighty tasty as well, though I wasn't feeling something heavy and dairy-laden that day so I passed.  It's too bad because all I wanted after a long night out was a fulfilling, tasty burger and other comfort food selections. I wouldn't completely rule out giving this place another try because I feel like we may have just gone on an off day, but honestly there are so many choices in Vegas it's hard to overlook a bad experience.",

I would have thought the manager would have said something to her.    On to the food, I did like the salt and vinegar popcorn that was brought out complimentary. We ordered a coffee which was completely watered down and tasteless, the turkey burger, and the Chicago dogs. The turkey burger was inedible but I was starving so I had half. The tomato was light red and unappetizing and the flavor of the meat was sickening. It was accompanied with naturally cut fries and I could taste the dirtiness of the oil. I did not try my girlfriends mini Chicago hot dogs but she said they tasted previously frozen. I tried her sweet potato fries and they were not cooked properly what so ever. I called over a manager to tell him the quality of the food was terrible and he comped our entire meal.",

The vibe and decor of the restaurant is cute and energetic and the servers are wonderful and attentive. The menu is also creative and has so many unique options for burger toppings such as cole slaw, tempura avocado, and fried egg. But when it comes down to it the food is just meh. Without even including the fact that the prices are a bit steep for burgers that are on the small side. On more than one occasion the shoestring fries came out overcooked and the meat undercooked (though I did ask for medium rare..). The unique ingredients and flavors also don't meld as much as I'd like them to.   I do however recommend the Fun-ghi burger which is underrepresented on this Yelp page (beef patty, grilled portobello, truffle oil, frisee) as well as the steak fries which are seasoned and plump. The Gold Standard has VERY strong flavors which didn't tingle my taste buds as much as I hoped it would. I found myself wanting to slather it in some other type of sauce which is never a good sign. Shakes are basic but love the alcoholic options. Also if you want to swap out fries for a side salad it's a $2 charge which is ridiculous because who actually WANTS salad over fries, usually it's an attempt to calm a guilty conscience. Overall, not everything here is delicious but there ARE some great menu items which are worth coming back for :)",

I just love the quick service at the Holsteins bar without feeling rushed.  It actually takes time to really relish a tasty burger, and I like the informality of the atmosphere and the friendly staff that's always quick to make a suggestion on what's good on the menu.  So sit at the bar and chow down on one of their burgers with one of their bloody mary's in tow!  Great Vegas hangover cure.  I made the mistake of not saving room for one of their milkshakes.  They look incredible.  Personal recommendations: \"The Rising Sun\" for a really interesting combination of classic American burger flavors with an Asian twist; and \"The Gold Standard\" can't be beat for just a solid, zesty, aromatic burger experience.",

However hubby was there on a business trip  with a group and since Holsteins advertised they had a \"house made\" vegan burger he said it'd be fine to go there. Otherwise there were other restaurants to pick from. So imagine his surprise when the waiter said that there were no vegan burgers because they didn't come in.  Silly us thought \"house made\" meant made in the restaurant. The waiter was nice enough but completely unaware of what vegan means as he tried to sell him on the salmon or turkey burger.  So hubby ended up with a salad. Sucks! Either have what you advertise or don't advertise it, or at least be ready to make a knowledgeable substitution.",

This time around the burger just didn't do it for me. It's smelled somewhat 'meaty.\" It was The Gold Standard and apparently has one best burger in Vegas a few years. I wish I loved it! I ate about half and then just gave up because I had this sky-high piled Bam-boozled shake in front of me! And when you're on vacation in Vegas, we all know the calories don't count! Although it was aptly named, The Fat Boy! It was amazing! Super indulgent and got me a little tipsy! I love the location of Holsteins and would probably go back to try something other than a burger or get that crazy shake again!",

The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked and our waiter was energetic and friendly. However, of course the milkshakes were the star of the show! Such unique flavors and combinations piled high in the shake. My favorite was the vanilla icing on the side of the glass which is used as a \"glue\" for even more toppings! The only down side is it was difficult at times to eat/drink the shake without making a mess!",

The Drunken Monkey is as much food as it is liquid, covered in Reeses pieces, banana laffy taffy,  and topped with a decent amount of booze. Even so, it was overpoweringly sweet, and could barely get 3/4ths of it down.  The burger was amazing. Every bite perfectly constructed, every morsel more delicious than the last. Best burger on the Strip, without question!  $18.5 for the burger, $16 for the shake, $11 for a really good beer I can't remember.",

Anyway, if you want to eat at a place equivalent to Friendlys or Applebees, this is for you! Ive come to the conclusion Cosmo charges a super high rent and it leaves these restaurants with alot of value perception building in order to sell their food. But when you get your food, you figure a $20 burger is going to be great. Then, you get it,  and its as dry as the bun. The wings? Well they taste like any sports bars but with a nice plate.   Ive had a few alcohol milkshakes around vegas too and theirs is just ok. Much better out there like Black Tap and Sugar Factory.   As a long time cosmo player, id suggest skipping this place.",

There's a burger for everyone - from a vegan patty to foie gras topping - so it's a pretty decent compromise for most folks. Plus, who gets mad eating burgers, anyway?  While Gold Standard is the...standard, I settled on Rising Sun: kobe beef, teriyaki sauce, crispy sweet potatoes, and avocado tempura (!!!). So, so satisfying - great balance of textures (crunchy, creamy) and flavors (savory, sweet) that made it a damn good burger.  While the shakes were tempting, there was NO way I was going to finish one by myself, as I was stuffed after my burger and fries. They're beautiful and can be boozy if you'd like - why do you betray me, tummy?  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stop by Holsteins again, whether it be for another burger or the shake (probably the burger). Mark my word!",

The huge disappointment came with the French fries. You'd think a place that specializes in gourmet burgers would nail their fries, but no. The fries are thin, like at McDonalds: they have almost as much frying oil as potatoes. Unlike McDonald's fries, however, these were lukewarm and completely unseasoned.  The other reason for the low review is the deafening music being pumped through the restaurant. You may not go deaf from one meal, but you may be hoarse after trying to have a conversation over it.",

Their burgers were great and I am even curious to go back and try their vegan burger as well. I couldn't leave Holsteins without trying one of their alcoholic shakes. I got the s'mores one and I would suggest going for the extra shot of alcohol if you are looking for that. I didn't opt for the extra alcohol, and I feel like I might as well have had a normal non-alcoholic shake. Definitely still a delicious shake though!  Don't forget to check in for 50% off of a beer!   Aside from the food, the service is great! Our server was so helpful with the menu and answered any questions we had while also providing his own opinions and suggestions. This is exactly what I hope for when visiting a new restaurant.

It was very creamy like a good shake should be, and you could definitely taste the liquor. I also loved that they give you the extra in the side. It makes the price a little easier to handle. We also wanted a snack so we shared the Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. Oh my gosh, whoever decided to come up with those is a genius! They are a must have.

I probably shouldn't be eating a giant burger before sitting by the pool but oh well. They're too delicious not too!!  Here are our favorites:  - 'THE RISING SUN'* - GOLD STANDARD* - BILLIONAIRE BURGER* - THE FUN-GHI* - THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER*  The burgers are delicious and perfectly cooked. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Sometimes they have fun new special burgers to try too. (Add a fried egg, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese, gruyere cheese, and avocado to any burger and make it extra delicious).   For sides and add ons get the buttermilk onion rings, fries, or buffalo chicken dip. Their fries and onion rings are tasty and delicious with their chipotle ranch. Their Bam Boozled shakes and regular shakes are amazing as well. I love their regular strawberry shakes and for Bam Boozled shakes the Fat Boy, Campfire Smores, and Cookies & Cream.   *   *   *  Burger descriptions, if you're curious:  'THE RISING SUN'* -kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado  GOLD STANDARD* - dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli  BILLIONAIRE BURGER*- kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, & truffle mayo  THE FUN-GHI*- beef patty topped w/ forest mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese, frisee, & truffle mayo  THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER* - beef patty crusted w/black pepper, mixed greens, holsteins creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, & swiss cheese",

Our server seemed uninterested and slightly annoyed and when we asked for suggestions she all but ran away before she could even finish talking but hey I get it, I've spent many years serving myself so I can let that slide. That being said, I wanted an ice cold beer to go with my burger so I asked for one on the menu, they didn't have it, so I asked for a second, they were also out of that, so finally my third choice was available, yay.....  After doing my yelp-due-diligence and prior research I knew that the Gold Standard was going to be an excellent choice, I mean come on it has bacon and cheese so what can go wrong? I ordered my burger medium rare but it came out well done. The burger was good, but was it Vegas WOW amazing good? Not IMO.   A few people at my table ordered the boozy, candy mountain, shakes, and those looked delicious but to be honest Vegas has so many on-point restaurants I am not sure I would take a risk and visit here again.",

We had the gold standard, the rising sun and the forager burger. The meats were so flavorful that we gobbled it up within 15 minutes. The shakes were only ok though. They were quite a sight but taste wise I had better from elsewhere. We ordered the cookies and cream and mint. The best thing to do is to get a bunch of burgers and share. I hope to try the other ones the next time I come back.",

I've dined here a number of times and their burgers have always tasted fresh and delicious.   Luckily I never had any issues with the wait and I can always order to-go if the restaurant is crowded. My favorite is the classic burger. I like my burgers simple without all the fancy ingredients. They beef patties are so juicy and the buns are soft and fluffy.",

    "text": "\"My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and they're like, it's better than yours..\" DAMN RIGHT it's...... THOSE ALCOHOLIC MILKSHAKES though!!! Soooo good!  Anyways back to my review, TBH originally my fiance and I wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR at Planet Hollywood for dinner (sorry haha), but it was a 45 min wait and we were HANGRY lol.  So we went here to Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan as our next option.   And good thing we came here!  We went inside and got seated right away. Plenty of seats and tables.   We ordered their Bam-BOOZLED milkshakes, which has alcohol in them. I ordered the cookies n cream shake and WOWWWWW IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!! I can hardly taste the alcohol and I had a good buzz out of it (maybe because I drank it too fast? lol sooo good!!)  FORGET GOING TO SERENDIPITY 3 for the frozen hot chocolate when you can have Holstein's milkshakes with ALCOHOL in it!!!   We also ordered the rising sun burger & steakhouse burger. The burgers are a little pricey but totally worth it. The quality is there! Probably one of my favorite crafted-burgers. Patty cooked to perfection. I recommend the rising sun burger for sure!  5 stars hands down. Please excuse the excessive use of my capitalization words lol. Holsteins is BOMB.",

We also had some shakes with alcohol that were really intricate and very delicious! I enjoyed my mint one and tried some of the cookies and cream one that had an ice cream sandwich on top! My favorite parts were the shakes and though I very much enjoyed the burgers, I think it's a little overpriced for my taste since for 2 burgers and 2 shakes I spent a bit over $70. I would personally prefer for other places to eat that I've spent that much on. However, definitely worth trying and I would recommend coming. Something else to note is that the staff was fantastic!",

If anyone tells you that you get SO much milkshake that you get the extra in a metal cup, tell them they need to throw away the ONE CUP of whipped cream off the top, and suddenly you have half a shake in the glass anyway! Ta-da!   Burgers  ($15-20 average price) includes fries, which you can upgrade to sweet potato fries or onion rings for an extra $2.50)  Regular fries are salty and have a really nice texture. (To be really unclassy but honest, I would say they have the same consistency as Burger King fries.)  For my to go order, got the gold standard burger, which was a thick patty that came out quite raw. I like steaks medium rare, but not thick patty burgers. :( Would recommend you specify how you want it done.  If you're staying at the Cosmo, this is a great choice to grab a bite before heading out the door. I can't say that it's a place I'd walk halfway across the strip to eat at, especially if you get a burger, shake, and fries for $30 + tip.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp and get a free small beer!

On the weekends they do not take reservations.  Good thing it wasn't too busy so we only had to wait about 5 minutes before being seated.  While waiting in their lounge area, it was very very loud.  Almost too hard to carry on a conversation with someone sitting right next to me.  I was keeping my fingers a crossed for a quieter dining area.    More quiet? Not so much.  Still a little loud but we powered through.  Service wasn't too shabby.  We were checked on frequently during our meal with drinks always refilled.   I tried their California Turkey Burger with sweet potato fries. The burger had a good flavor with avocado, cucumber slaw, spouts and a Russian dressing.  Pretty tasty.  The fries were also good but a little too much salt.    Amazing shakes... Indeed.  I had the pecan turtle cheesecake shake.  Yum.  Cheesecake, pecans, dark chocolate pieces, caramel sauce and stoli salted caramel vodka.  I fell in love.  So good.    Food was ok for me but I'd definitely come back for a shake any time!",

The setting is sporty casual with some amusing artwork featuring cartoon cows and pickles. I plan to come back for an actual meal or order to-go next time I stay at the Cosmo.   Complimentary popcorn in a bucket really hit the spot! This popcorn had a salty and tangy seasoning similar to corn nuts, ranch flavor.   Ahi poke tostadas starter consisted of perfect bite sized portions of poke over 6 round corn tortilla chips. Reminded me of tuna tartare. Would recommend this for anyone that is looking for a light healthier option.   Onion rings were breaded and crispy like Popeyes crispy chicken. They were quite large and a decent portion but nothing to die for. We preferred regular ranch dip to the accompanying chipotle ranch.   The natural cut fries in a bucket were perfect to share.",

Music was low but audible, more old school rock than the rap they portray in the grafitti-esque decor. Overstaffed for the time we went in (tuesday 2pm-ish) but better than being understaffed. all in all i would return.",

I had the rising sun burger & while I was a little bit nervous about how all those flavors would go together, it was amazing & blew my mind. Also their shakes are massive & well worth the money you spend on them. Service wasn't outstanding but definitely wasn't below average. It didn't take away from the 5 star rating on the food. I've been to other burger joints on the strip but this one is by far my favorite.",

They've got 10+ different shakes to chose from, which makes it difficult, but we finally narrowed it down to the birthday cake shake and the creme brulee shake. Both were amazingly yummy. The birthday cake has bits of cake in it to give it great texture. They both tasted great and the alcohol was just the right amount - not too overpowering. And the whipped cream on top was delicious too.   The food was excellent too. I loved the lobster mac and cheese. We also got the Fun-ghi burger - which came with mushrooms and gruyere cheese - and it was very tasty. We also tried the pork belly sliders, which came on the white buns that baos come in and those were good too.   Food and shakes were really yummy here. The decor is really cute - they've got these cute characters all over the walls of the restaurant. Located inside the Cosmopolitan. I'll be back to try the oreo shake and the red velvet shake next time!!!",

I loved the tempura avocado, such a unique awesome thing to put on a burger!

Many yelpers recommended the \"Gold Standard,\"  and with that name, I went for it.  After sinking my teeth into the dry aged sirloin burger, a sudden disappointment hit me.  I might've gotten a little too much goat cheese in the first bite, so went for a second bite.  No!  It can't be.  The Gold Standard did not meet my standard for a burger.  Oversalted and didn't go well with the goat cheese.  Yes, I like goat cheese too.    It's okay though!! There's crispy pork burns on the table.  My first pork bun was at Ippudo in NYC.  I understood the hype within seconds and ordered a second.  The pork buns from Holsteins didn't let me relive that moment.  There was too much hoisin sauce, which made it overly salty.  Oh, the pork was also dry.    Our waiter was actually pretty nice.  However, the service was slow.  The restaurant was full and I saw him constantly filling orders, so I could sympathize.  I usually destroy my burgers and leave nothing but I just couldn't finish my burger and pork buns.  Salt was used very liberally.",

Anyhoot, Vegas, burgers, cheat weekend, let's go.   Holsteins was my pick for the start of my carb filled weekend, and what better way to indulge in all things anti-paleo than lobster mac and cheese; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg#F37UvLqIeBiOtJSEMKJUIg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  Flavor was spot on, noodles were cooked to a nice al dente, there was a nice crispy layer on top, and loads of lobster. But of course there was a \"but,\" a very big butt; the sauce was like water. No creamy gooey goodness to be found here, just a soupy base to the above perfection. So close this was to being a perfect mac, but someone forgot to reduce the sauce or add some flour?   To wash all that down, what could be better than a nice refreshing milk shake, the fat boy; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_g#qJ267GYmENq1w8KYgX5k_g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  Named after my favorite Harley style, this obese child contained no less than the following; Stoli Salted Karamel Veodka, Reese's, pretzels, sprinkles, and chocolate-caramel popcorn. All I tasted was ice cream and a hint of caramel, it was damn tasty though.  And lastly was my first bite of bread in a month, the gold standard burger; dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli, to which I felt it imperative to add a fried egg; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3Ung#a3D9HOKAJZYVj6cR8H3Ung\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  Overall, meh+. The sum of the parts was better than okay, not quite great, but somewhere around good. Once I began my dissection, I found the beef patty itself to be under-seasoned and without a nice crust. The bun could have used a few minutes on the grill to get a nice crust as well to protect itself from the toppings. Flavor-wise the meat was beefy, but it completely depended on the bacon for salt. I am happy to report that it was cooked to my order of med-rare; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQ#A7ieEZkpm3TjPlM9wgsUBQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  Being my first proper burger in months, I was a little let down that it wasn't mind-blowing, but overall everything was a-okay.",

    "text": "This would have been four stars, except for one major problem.  My girlfriend and I decided to spend Xmas in Las Vegas.  We stayed at The Cosmopolitan because it's a Marriott Autograph Collection property, and it was basically free.  As we were walking through the hotel, checking out all the places to eat, we saw Holstein's and decided to drop in.  The burger I had was really good, but could have used a little less salt.  I forgot the name, but it was some sort of teriyaki or something like that.  Nice flavor combinations.  I ate the whole thing and was completely full, not even needing to eat dinner that night.  I thought I'd start off by having their vegan raspberry shake.  It seems odd to have a vegan shake with a burger, but there's a reasoning here.  They brought the shake out, and my eyes widened.  The joy of having a shake, something I haven't done since I was 12, was amazing.  The raspberry sorbet and soy whipped topping were a delightful combination.  The shot of alcohol in it wasn't noticed, but I'm sure it was there.  If you're looking to get a buzz, you'd need 3-4 of these.  The server was excellent.  She was attentive to our needs, brought the orders promptly, and as far as we knew, they were correct.  She kept checking in on us, without being annoying, and basically did a great job.  That's easily a three star, maybe even a four star review.  Why the cut to two?  Apparently they don't know what vegan means.  I'm not a vegan, but I am severely sensitive to dairy.  This shake had whipped cream instead of soy whipped topping.  I wasn't positive...it could have been something else I ate that day, and the great flavor of that shake was something I needed to try again.  I braved it, ordered the same shake, and had the same violent reaction.  Nothing else I ate that second time several days later was the same.  I was vigilant in seeing I had nothing dairy.  I'm deeply disappointed in the restaurant serving something labeled as vegan, when it clearly has an animal product (dairy).",

We ordered truffled lobster mac and cheese, steak fries, coconut shrimp, and crispy pork belly buns. Our bill was way less than expected. Under $50 for two people! Service was alright. It was also Memorial weekend. A lot of younger crowds dining here with a good thirty minute wait.",

First, there was the regular chocolate milkshake I ordered. It was watery and not very creamy, like there wasn't enough ice cream and not very good quality ice cream. It was also small considering it was $8. Maybe that's why the waitress tried to sell me an alcohol milkshake.  I ordered the burger rare and it took a while to get our food. My burger came out medium well, but I was really hungry and had no patience to send it back. The burger itself was just ok, nothing great. $5 for fries, and not very many fries.",

I mean when you order a burger it should taste like beef not .85 cent teriyaki sauce or sweet baby rays BBQ sauce but I digress. The bun was delicious and the fries were excellent, I went with the steak cut. The decor in the restaurant was very hip, kinda Japanese anime-esque. The service was very good and friendly.",

However, the only thing that saves this place are the milkshakes. I got an oreo one and it was super creamy and delish.   So i ordered a bull's balls (fried risotto balls), holstein sliders, and duck duck goose burger with duck fat fries.   The risotto balls stuffed with veal was delicious but could have had creamier risotto on the inside. The lardo on top was amazing but lardo tastes good no matter what. Theres no skill involved to make pig fat taste good.  holstein sliders were okay sliders but i've had better.  My DUck duck goose burger was a huge disappointment. Its a beef patty stuffed with duck and foie gras sounds awesome right?! and i ordered it medium rare. IT WAS DRYY AS a mother! and the duck fat fries..........lets just say i rather have McDonalds. no duck fat flavor which makes me wonder do they even use duck fat?! FAILLLLLL  Also a note on the service. I waited my entire meal to get a glass of water. -___________-'",

I had the fun-ghi:  Gruyere cheese, forest mushrooms, frisee and truffle something, mayo I think.  There's a noticeable weight to the burger when you pick it up.  Bun is nice and sturdy.  And most distinctive the the rough cut to the meat - it's not ground as thoroughly as most patties. Very nice texture.  WARNING:  they cook their burgers more thoroughly than other places - and i note that other posters have mentioned that.  There was not a shred of pink in my Medium.  That being said, the burger was plenty juicy.  WARNING:  prices are high, but on par with similar places on the Strip.",

    "text": "After reading and salivating over the rave reviews for this place, my bf and I decided to give this place a try. We showed up around 7pm on a Saturday, and there wasn't a wait. We should have taken this as a bad sign...   The FOOD: Since we weren't that hunger, we just ordered the guacamole with pita chips for an appetizer and the hen house burger for an entree. The guacamole and pita chips were good, but nothing special. Also, there were way more chips than guacamole.. wasn't impressed. Then theres the burger. My first impression was that it was TINY for a $14 burger, but I thought the taste would make up for it. I take my first bite and...... BLAND! The flavor of the meat was nothing special and you could hardly even taste the egg in the burger. I have tried burgers from many different burger joints, and this burger does NOT even come close to being considered one of the best!  The SERVICE: Other reviews say they received popcorn once they were seated, we did not; I guess their popcorn machine was broken that night! The servers were nice, but the service itself wasn't that great. After we were almost done with our food, our server did not come by once to ask if we'd like a refill. I didn't even get my water refill until AFTER the she brought us the check; I had been running on empty for about 10 minutes. Also, it took a while for her to get our bill straightened out (probably about 15 minutes), and the place wasn't even fully busy.  Overall, I expected to have great food and great service and I was disappointed. I know other yelpers really like this place, and I really wanted to like it too, but I guess my relationship with Holsteins just wasn't meant to be!",

My husband had a beer of some kind, which he really liked, and I had an Oreo and bailey's milkshake, which was excellent.   For dinner my husband ordered the Big Fat Greek - a spicy lamb burger. The burger was excellent. The feta cheese and tatziki sauce paired with the flavors of the meat very well. It was a great burger all-in-all.   I ordered the Radicchio Steak Salad, and it was quite a disappointment. First off, I've ordered a Radicchio salad before, but the radicchio in this one was extremely bitter, so bitter I couldn't eat it. So I called the waiter back and told him it was extremely bitter. He was very obliging and offered to change the radicchio out for some regular greens, which I decided to take him up on. He also mentioned that a lot of patrons do this with the Radicchio Salad, which made me wonder why he hadn't offered to do this when we ordered, or warned me that the Radicchio would be bitter. Either way, they changed out my salad for no charge and brought back my steak on a bed of greens. The second thing I did not like in the salad was that the steak was done medium rare, and I like mine well done. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and when I asked to have it cooked a little more the waiter apologized and said it would not be possible due to safety regulations. Once a dish is plated and brought out to a customer, it cannot be put back in a pan. So I just ate a few bits of the steak. The rest of the salad was ok. The Dressing it came with was pretty tasty, but if I go back to Holsteins Shakes and Buns, I'll be sticking to a burger.",

I did enjoy the free glass of beer you get fr checking in. Our friends had a black&white milkshake which they enjoyed. As for the ambience it's super loud and attracts loud people it seems. Overall I would not return esp since there are so many other choices on the Strip. Thanks again Erik!",

    "text": "We travelled all of the way to Vegas, to see one of the most famous Canadians in concert, that being Celine Dion.  A burger destination is a perfect post concert treat.  That being said, there is a plethora of burger joints in town.  After sifting through many Yelp pages, Holsteins looked legit.  Like many places in this town they are open late.  We made a reservation which was handy, because this place was packed.  After being seated, we looked at the extensive drink list.  They had an impressive mix of beer, wine, and cocktails.  I had looked at the menu ahead of time, which is helpful, because the shear size of this menu was slightly intimidating.  I went with the the steakhouse burger, which was a Beef Patty Crusted With Black Pepper, Holsteins Creamy Steak Sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, Wild Mushrooms, Swiss Cheese, for $17.50.  The burger arrived, and biting into it, it was cooked medium rare, and just beyond juicy.  As wonderful and flavourful the patty was, i felt that the toppings got muddled together.  I wish that they omitted one or two components, that way the selected ingredients could be shown off, instead of hidden in the background.  All of the burgers come with shoestring or steakhouse fries.  I respect the extra effort they put out, by not just offering pedestrian fries.  We sampled both, and they were crispy, and perfectly salted.    Overall, the atmosphere was young and fun, and the burger was great, however by choosing to eat on the strip, you are paying way more than at a similar restaurant off the strip.",

What kind of illegal drugs are on those shoestring fries to make them so tasty? I'm sold on this place.   I love the decor and that it is not facing the casino floor. Sometimes you just want to not see or hear a slot machine, amirite?   We had a large group and had to keep adding chairs on, and the servers were really accommodating.

Artsy and trendy and the service was decent (the servers were not 100% in tune to what they were serving). But the overall visit was not what I hoped.  The breakdown: I was invited by The Light Group to dine in before the club. So, there were tables of beautiful women dressed to impress but not ready to chow down wearing their club attire (me included). Deep Fried everything, and not the best samples of their burgers. (the menu was pre determined, served as a 4 course meal). It was a pleasure to be hosted by them and I would have not discovered them otherwise.  But ....  Second \"chance\" Visit (Late May) I was in heaven ... even if for a moment.  The breakdown: It was recovery Sunday (from Saturday night gallivanting). We all know the best hangover cure it some heavy greasy food ... so I gave it a second try. It was much more casual, with no worries of feeling full after.  There was a 40 min wait (that tells you its quite popular). but there was room at the bar which also had full service. The way they place the barstools leaves plenty of elbow room to really get down, without throwing 'bows.  I had: The Golden Standard (because I just couldn't talk myself into paying $28 for one burger \"Billionaire Burger\" though I was tempted). and it was delicious. Didn't even need to add a thing. no ketchup, salt, nada. It was made to perfection (medium) I chose a side of Sweet Potato Fries which were decent, but a little soggy at the end. While I waited, I washed down a Brown Cow Float, which was basically a turnt up Rootbeer Float with \"pop rocks\" and it brought me back to being a kid with the rocks popping in my mouth. LOVED IT!! I tried their Bucket of Buffalo Wings, and I liked how they didn't drench it with sauce. I enjoyed licking my fingers to that before and during my burger meal.   I guess there is a time and place for everything ... and figuring out the right moment makes a HUGE difference.  Holsteins \"before\" the club NO Holsteins the day \"after\" DEFINITELY",

Might have been my taste buds coming off of a nutrition plan, but even my hubby said it was salty as heck.  I seriously felt like I was eating  salt lick in Vegas.  Burger - cooked just right and was juicy Teriyaki - salty, salty salty - had remove some from my burger Sweet potato fries - salty, greasy, soggy  Maybe next time I will try something else, maybe a shake to compliment the salt.",

A PROPER brioche bun that tastes and feels like it was baked a few hours and a few yards away. Juicy fresh ground meat, melty cheese, good smoked bacon, served HOT! Mine came with arugula and garlic aioli so I didn't add a thing. Fries were very good, and real potatoes. My wife had a delicious and LARGE chocolate malt. Her burger came with onion rings that were wonderful. I'd come back for just those and a shake! When I think of Bobby's Burger Joint, that's Ratdonald's next to this place!",

On the previous trip I had tried Burgr across the street and this place is definitely a better burger restaurant. It was a Sunday on a holiday weekend so it was fairly busy, we put our name in and they take your phone number so they can send a text when your table is ready. Went and played some slots for a half hour and BOOM, got a text, awesome.  I ordered a Pretty simple burger, bacon cheese and a very good garlic sauce. I love that their burgers come with fries, so much easier to pay the \"Burger bar\" prices when it comes with a side. The burger was very good, perfectly cooked and great accompaniments. We also ordered one of the adult milkshakes, candy bar vodka and chocolate peanut butter flavorings, delicious.  Serving was very good, fairly quick ticket times, no problems there.  I will definitely be back ot Holsteins for my burger fix in Vegas.",

We sat at the bar so there was no real wait for us to be seated. Since our order was pretty simple we were served pretty quickly. While we waited decided what to order we chatted with the bartenders who were all very nice and helpful in our milk shake flavor decisions.   I ordered the frozen grasshoper and my friend got the tiramisu flavor. We thoroughly enjoyed our selections. Our fries order was large enough for us to share and we also both really like their fries.  We did not try any of the burgers but I have been here before and have ordered the Rising Sun Burger which is super tasty. I have also tried their lobster mac and cheese which is just meh in my opinion. However, I do recommend their fried pickles if you are a pickle fan.",

I think it had expensive beef in it, but what caught my eye was the slab of foie gras!! First bite, I was in foie gras heaven! Since CA ban the sale of foie gras, I have not had it in a very long time. All that richness flavors that make foie gras a big deal was present! The burger patty was cooked perfectly rare. Now, most would be like wondering why I am not talking about the burger patty; well what ever kind of beef they use is not a issue with me because all those labels on types of beef is over rated. For example, if it was really Kobe Beef it would have been a very small piece of it for Holsteins to only charge 32 bucks. They said the mayo spread had truffles or maybe they used truffle oil, it doesn't matter because I did not taste it. The star of this dish was the slab of seared foie gras and that perfectly cooked patty. It made me happy! The star power of the foie gras was so great I wasn't even sure if I got fries or onion rings with my meal, oh well! I can't wait to come back again for more foie gras!!!",

    "text": "Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I brought a friend from out of town to check out this joint known for high end burgers and boozy milkshakes.  The restaurant space has a good mix of seats at the bar, low tables with comfy couches, and standard booths/chairs.  Music is pumping and artwork on the walls definitely add a cool vibe, but it's not overwhelming where one can't enjoy good conversation amongst close friends.  As for the menu, there is quite the impressive beverage selection including a wide array of international/domestic beers, wines, cocktails, and unique sodas.  My friend and I were definitely in the mood to pair some burgers with their signature shakes and I got the Drunken Monkey (with Reese's, banana, malt, and Frangelico) whereas my friend ordered the Creamsicle Float (whipped cream smirnoff,  orange sherbet, ibc cream soda, and orange bubble sugar).  My biggest fear was that the alcohol component would actually distract one's enjoyment of the milkshake, but unexpectedly the problem ended up being the complete opposite in that neither of us tasted nor felt any effects of any trace of alcohol in our shakes (i.e. neither one of us had our trademark Asian flush go into effect).  Perhaps the Holstein's staff has figured out some magic ratio/technique to eliminate both the taste and effect of alcohol in their shakes, but a little of both would serve to go a long way especially if one is paying double digit dollars.  As for the burgers, we opted to split the crowd favorite Gold Standard and Steakhouse Burger.  The Gold Standard consists of dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli, but my taste buds felt like they were in Charlie Brown's classroom in that all the ingredients were rendered a slur of incomprehensibility by the overpowering goat cheese.  The Steakhouse burger, on the other hand, did a much better job showcasing its melange of ingredients consisting of pepper-crusted beef, housemade creamy steak sauce, marmalade onions, tomato confit, wild mushrooms,  and swiss cheese.  Taste buds were dancing their way upstairs to Marquee on this one.  For every burger, one has the choice of shoestring fries or the thick steak fries (which resemble seasoned potato wedges) so one will not go wrong depending on personal preference.    Overall, the burgers  do not come cheap (ranging from $14-28) nor do the milkshakes ($11) but to paraphrase Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction,  \"That's a pretty f*cking good milkshake/burger. I don't know if it's worth (insert some double digit number) dollars but it's pretty f*cking good.\"",

    "text": "Burger joints are a dime a dozen now. But I went with what Yelp suggested and the reviews were on the money!   I couldn't not get a shake. Seriously, even after a day of drinking. Even though I knew it could potentially be a bad idea later. I had to get a shake! I mean, it's in the name! So I settled on the Campfire S'Mores shake (Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow, Graham Crumble). It was not an easy choice, but i was very happy after the first sip. I sampled the Birthday Cake one (which I wavered between) and felt that the S'Mores one definitely had more flavor. At $11 a pop, it's not cheap, but I do appreciate they give you a tin with extra shake in it!  For dinner I knew right away I wanted The Fun-Ghi (Beef Patty, Roasted Portabello, Carmelized Onion, Truffle Oil, Gruyere, Frisee, Aioli). It was pretty awesome! I hate when you order a mushroom burger and there's barely any mushrooms. Thankfully there were plenty, and it was marinated to perfection. Plus, the fries weren't too shabby either. For $16.5, it's a pricey burger, but hey, it's Vegas baby!   For a casual evening I think this is just the right place to dine. Plus, you can get a hearty meal in before things get too crazy!",

During my first visit, when things were a blur, I have to say it was amazing. This time around, I just thought it was okay. The main gripe I have about my meal is that my meat was overcooked- even though I asked for medium rare (no pink to be found). Luckily, I split this burger so I only had to deal with half of it. Both times, I have tried the rising sun burger and that was a good choice. The onion rings and the shake (birthday shake) were both excellent- maybe you should just go to snack and get a shake... but the burger, I'm sure you can shop elsewhere.   Service was good as they comped our shakes due to some trouble with our reservation. The decor is pretty interesting in here and sure to start some conversations.  P.S. The complimentary popcorn is delicious! And I'll likely try this place again when they open the location in Orange County (South Coast Plaza).",

They have a pig for a mascot and the artwork depicts said pig experiencing various culinary delights. Very very good stuff.   On to the food. We started the meal with Mexican Car Bombs. No, no, this isn't a play on the Irish bombs. No Dos Equis Patron shots. They are jalapenos stuffed with cheese, black beans and corn then wrapped in bacon!!! Holy bacon fat batman! Excellent creation and a must order.   Burgers:   Gold Standard was delicious. Bacon and aged goat cheddar with their udder sauce. The sauce is tangy and could use an addition of spice.   The Classic was pretty good. Basic burger dressed with tomato, onion, lettuce and of course, we added some swine and queso.   Shakes:  I went for the peppermint choco shake, no alcoholic cause I don't drink anymore. It tastes a bit like a girl scout cookie that may have found it's way to your doorstep in months past.  Strawberry was solid, with some gummy candies added to the top .Whipped cream is fresh and made in house, excellent touch there.   Overall this is a solid spot to get a burger. It's a bit pricey, so plan accordingly.",

The kobe beef, which was thick&juicy, was cooked perfectly at medium rare like I had asked. Really enjoyed the sweetness from the teriyaki and the crunch from the yam & crispy yet soft tempura avocado. The fried egg recommended by my waiter was def a nice add-on. Altogether, amazing flavors&definitely recommend!  Coffee & Donuts Milkshake (coffee ice cream, cake donut, kahlua,& chocolate espresso beans) - milkshake w/ alcohol? So down&so delicious! It was thick, not watery&too blended out like most milkshakes. The soft cake donut & crunchy espresso beans were a nice touch. And the kahlua hit the spot. Although the burgers were good, it's the milkshakes that make me want to back to Vegas& eat at Holstein's again.  Overall, awesome experience! The service was really great, as our waiter was super friendly&attentive. The burger&milkshake were mouth-watering. And the ambiance w/ its unique paintings of cow was really cool. Definitely recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "Holsteins Shakes and Buns remains one of my favorite restaurants to dine at on The Strip. This review is an update on my most recent experience where I attended a friend's birthday dinner.  My friend made reservations in advance for a party of six people. Our hostess led us to the back of the restaurant to a cozy booth with additional chairs on the outskirts, which accommodated our party nicely. There weren't many people dining there at 7:00pm on a Wednesday, which was nice because we did receive a lot of attentive service from the waitstaff.   FOOD + Oreo Milkshake: Started the evening off with a tall glass of this shake made from crushed Oreos and Bailey's Irish Cream. If you're concerned that you're going to receive a mouthful of booze, you won't. There was only a hint of Bailey's that I could detect. Rather than one ingredient dominating over the other, both blended nicely to create a creamy, concoction.   + Rising Sun Burger: Order the optional egg with this burger. Trust me. It's what makes it bomb. But even if you don't like eggs, this burger is solid. A little on the dense side. I wasn't sure if that was due to the thickness of the meat patty or the tempura avocado and yam toppings, but I had a tough time taking bites. I can't say if I enjoyed the sweetness of the teriyaki glaze. I think there was too much of it slathered onto my Kobe beef patty. Just a light amount brushed over the patty would've been perfect for my tastes. Other than that criticism, that didn't stop me from eating the entire burger and the side of fries.  SERVICE Great service. Our server was friendly and patient, and she even placed a birthday candle on top of my friend's Drunken Monkey shake. Nice touch.   OVERALL Food and service were on the spot. There's no doubt that I'll be making a return trip to try more of their burgers and shakes.",

The ambiance is cool and laid back with great art work that is quite fitting for what they serve. It is open and airy with plenty of room to sit and hang while you get sloppy with their alcohol infused shakes.   We were seated immediately and was met with a very friendly and knowledgable host. She was able to steer us in any direction with great suggestions on drinks and appetizers.   I ordered the Urth burger adding cheddar and grilled wild mushrooms and Chris ordered the Standard with avocado. The lobster mac n' cheese and sweet potato fries were also ordered.   The meals came promptly and was a decent size. Chris said it was a burger with nothing special. He said the patty was just a patty with underwhelming flavors.....he did mention that an In n Out would have been better. My Urth burger was nothing exciting either. The patty was bland and their blend of veggies was of mediocre level. I definitely had better veggie burger at a far more unknown spot. I couldn't bring myself to finish the burger. Chris ate his but was still hungry. The lobster mac n' cheese was okay. Just a bit runny and very little lobster. Chris was not a fan. I was left to eat most of it by myself b  We didn't try their shake which I am sure is the highlight of this location. Maybe next time. But as far as burgers go....we were not impressed and probably wouldn't be back for their burgers but maybe for their shakes.",

The prototypical example of so many spots in resort areas (especially Vegas) where they will always make money due to the location and huge range of clientele who may or may-not know any better.  Don't waste your time or money.",

    "text": "First thoughts: Is that a paper-mache cow in the middle of the room?   Holsteins really has out done themselves with the funky street art hung up all around their restaurant. It keeps the space looking fresh and not dated. The food selection looked great! Though my bf and I didn't order any entree food items, I noticed some of the other diners eating burgers and fries. The burgers looked big and juicy and would be something I'd be interested in ordering the next time I'm back at Holsteins.  My bf and I came to Holsteins specifically for dessert and we ordered a black and white milkshake to split ($8). While waiting for our dessert, our server brought a bucket of popcorn to the table. The complimentary popcorn may have looked unassuming in the little pail but once we started nibbling on it, we couldn't stop! It was warm, buttery and some pieces had a slight sour bite to it. It was crack popcorn!  The milkshake was rich and oh-so delicious. I'm not particularly fond of sweets but I found myself taking large gulps of it. The whipped cream on top was just enough and truly the perfect compliment to the vanilla and chocolate. There were also little chocolate wafer balls on top of the milkshake that added the perfect crunch.  Bottom line: Word of advice: order one of the milkshakes; you won't regret it.",

Initially we were bummed since we were looking forward to the tasting menu and the amazing food at Scarpetta, but our mood quickly turned.   There was no wait and we sat down right away. I had the chicken club, which was excellent. Chicken was super juicy and the bun was great. All the veggies were supper fresh. My boyfriend had the lamb burger and it was excellent! We have a pretty robust selection of Greek restaurants in Chicago so I wasn't expecting much, but it was delicious. The lamb was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The sauce was superb.   We will definitely be back here for a casual, yet very tasty meal.",

When the bill arrived I'm not so sure we saved much, but at least our belly's were full.   No particular dish my group ordered stood out as amazing 'must try.' I had the Steakhouse burger. It was good but a little too greasy for my liking. My friend ordered the Urth Burger. I had a few bites and found it quite bland. I was also disappointed that my sweet potato fries were lukewarm. The item I was most impressed with we're the onion rings. The onion was cut thick and generously battered.   Logistically, I liked that they took my cell phone number and called me when our table was ready, so my group was able to have a drink in the Chandelier bar while we waited. Overall not a bad choice for dinner but also nothing to brag about.",

It has a Kobe beef patty and thick layer of cheese and a slight creamy layer of 1000 island dressing and to top it off crispy potato chips, which makes it not only savory but also texturally stimulating. My wife got the \"Urthbuger\", which is a vegetable patty and other green stuff... Lol.. I'll never understand women. I personally didn't think it was good but she loved it. The server also asked if she was vegan to check if she wanted cheese. I thought that was good and paying attention to detail. The service was also top notch, my water was refilled. Also if you check-in on yelp you get a free 12oz draft. My daughter got a cheese sandwich meal which was decent but the mini fudge sundae made it worth 6$ (see pic). It was large, and yummy with a big scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Easily fed the 3 of us and we didn't even finish it. All said with tax, tip... It was worth paying 55$. I'd still prefer In/Out but it was Thanksgiving and the only establishments open are on the strip. Only minus a star for the price.",

    "text": "Let me just cut to the chase on this review, DO NOT EAT HERE. I love fine dining and have no problem dropping a good amount of money on a good meal, but I've never had a worse dining experience than at Holsteins. With that being said, let me explain myself.  I had been to Holsteins once before my nightmare of an experience with them, and had a decent experience, the food was good, but none of the visit was anything noteworthy. On my second visit we came to celebrate a friend's 21st birthday, her having chose the venue. We were all dressed up and went to Holsteins sparing no expense and had plans to go to Marquee Monday after dinner. We were seated promptly, and all was well. We then each ordered several drinks, burgers, appetizers, shakes, you name it, and we were all just getting into our meals when our waiter came to fill our water glasses. As he filled our water glasses he accidentally knocked one over, spilling water onto my meal as well as my friend next to me.  We jumped back, as the water was ice cold and we were surprised. He panicked and then promptly began to mop up the water. As he did so, he leaned heavily on our table and the table toppled over, knocking our drinks and food into my friends lap, as well as mine. My friend was wearing white pants, so their cranberry and vodka and my birthday cake cocktail made their white pants look like a menstrual accident. Our waiter went to retrieve some towels, and another staff member tried to bring towels as well. The pants were not salvageable, nor was my barely touched meal. I had ordered a burger and fries, a 13 or 14 dollar cocktail, and an appetizer, all of which were destroyed. I'd only had a sip of my cocktail, less than half of my burger, and just a mere fried pickle before my food was doused with cocktails and spilled into our laps. Our waiter apologized, but no solution was offered. No one asked if they could replace our soiled, inedible meals, or offered to cover our portion of the bill.  I work in a company that prides itself on flawless customer service, and was appalled at the response I received. We were handed our bills and nothing more was said. My friend and I were livid! Any half decent restaurant manager would have comped our entire party and apologized profusely, but he didn't even come to see our party and apologize when the waiter informed him of the situation. We payed our bill and I asked the hostess to see the manager. He came out to talk to me and was the epitome of a young, overly confident prick. I recanted the story of what happened at our table and he stared blanky at me until I finished speaking. His exact words were \"I am sorry about the inconvenience, but I saw the whole thing happen, and it was you guys moving the table that caused it.\"   At this point I was seething with rage. I told him that he wasn't even on the restaurant floor when it happened, and that we had completely leaned away from the table witht the initial spill. He just stared at me with glazed eyes, and nodded his head. I then told him that I knew he really didn't care what I was saying and I didn't appreciate him being patronizing rather than showing any form of empathy. Words cannot describe how horrific this manager was, and because of his lack of any sense I will never give any of my business to this restaurant ever again. I'm quite frankly floored that such an incredible establishment like the Cosmopolitan would allow such people to run one of their restaurants.  All I can say is don't waste your time, the service alone makes this establishment boycott worthy. Save your money and eat elsewhere on the strip. I've heard horror stories about strip eateries, but I've never heard or experienced one as ghastly nightmarish as this.  So again, DO NOT EAT HERE.",

Got the Gold Standard and I thought it was alright. The burger was definitely large, finished half, but for some reason it wasn't hitting the spot. The Gold Standard is a dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aioli. The tomato confit was overpowering. Couldn't taste the garlic-chive aioli. It just tasted like tomato. Maybe I'm not a tomato fan? Maybe I'm a bit too harsh of a critic? The burger was good, but not a wow factor. Maybe next time I'll hold the tomato confit and add mushrooms instead. A plus for this place is that it is a large restaurant. Went on a really busy Vegas weekend and didn't have to wait for a table. Maybe all of vegas was still recovering from the weekend's vegas motor speedway festivities and we were the few that got ourselves up to get some lunch.",

We had also ordered 2 drinks which were also very good. We then returned there for lunch and were not disappointed. We had a rising sun burger and el machete burger. Steak fries was very good and burgers very fresh and rising sun burger specifically was very original. Slightly sweet because of the sauce on top and had an Asian taste to it. We also had a pitcher of red sangria. Tasted very good, but did not seem to have any alcohol in it.Very good food though! Oh, and if you like milk shakes, they make them with alcohol (which is also undetectable, but the teramisu shake we had was pretty good). Overall, great experience! Will definitely return next time we are in Vegas",

    "text": "We attended the NAB Show this year and stopped by Holsteins for dinner.  Since none have eaten here before, we decided to order three different burgers and share.   So here is how they ranked.  Number one was definitely the Billionaire's burger: Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo.  TO DIE FOR!  Second was the Gold Standard: Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli.  It is their signature burger.  The third was The Rising Sun.  I think it was our least favorite because we were so full by the time we tried it.  It was good but turned out to be too rich at the moment.  Overall, they were all really tasty and I recommend everyone (even if burgers are not your thing) to try this place at least once! I was in Burger Heaven that night!",

    "text": "Okay so once again I'm going to disagree with my fellow yelp reviewers and say that I was not wowed by my meal at Holsteins Shakes and Buns, and I think there are better burger places in Vegas. Holsteins is located at The Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino directly across the entrance to the Marquee Pool and Day club. Because of the location you will need to have a reservation or be prepared to wait with the diva's and meat sticks that frequent the place.  We did have a reservation and were seated on time. The decor at Holsteins is eighties cool. Cartoon Artwork dots the walls, boom boxes are painted in bright colors and a huge pink cow welcomes you in the bar area. After looking over the menu, my wife Simone ordered the Meatball Parm sliders and I ordered the Nom-Nom burger topped with melted cheese, Potato Chips and House made thousand Island dressing. The food came out fairly quickly, and on the side I had some tasty crunchy potato stick thin french fries. My burger however was overcooked ( ordered medium and got well done). An overcooked burger made with fresh ground meat ends up tasting like sawdust, and this was the case. The burger could have been saved by the dressing, but there was very little of the dressing on it. The Chips on top were the best part of the burger. Medium thin hand cut and fried perfectly, they stayed crispy on the sandwich and gave a nice contrast to the burger, but overall this burger sounded better then it tasted. Simone's sliders were the exact opposite of my burger. The meatballs had great garlicky flavor, they were moist, tender and tasted fresh. They were topped with a mixture of sweet marinara and basil pesto and lots of melted creamy mozzarella. I so wanted to steal them from her and I had total meat envy.  We finished off the meal with a Reese PB adult shake spiked with Frangelico called the Drunken Monkey.  Any monkey that could get drunk off this would have to be a lightweight because I could taste no alcohol in it whatsoever. It was still good, once again just not as good as advertised.  So in the end I would have given Holsteins a 2 star rating for my food however Simone's sliders choice saved the day...so overall Holsteins gets a three stars from me.",

Its like a tradition for me now...go to holsteins at least once every time I go to Vegas.  Recently went here on a Friday in November around 3pm. It was about 1/2 full.  No complaints about service or anything like that. Everyone seemed friendly.  Bathrooms are clean.  The burgers that I ordered were amazing. One time the Big Fat Greek and another time the Nom Nom Burger. You'll remember the taste of the burger some time in the future after eating one and you'll get a random craving for it when you're back at home.  Burgers come with fries where you get a choice of regular, sweet potato, etc...  Burgers cost 15-20 bucks but when you spend a 20 here and there in vegas you'll say to yourself \"boy, that was probably the best 20 dollars i spent so far.\"   But come here with a couple of friends and you'll enjoy it more cause its not a place to come to get a quick bite to eat.",

So let's hope that includes calories too!!! I also had the \"machete\" burger. Chili peppers, garlic sauce, YUM!! Then all the usual choices for side items like onion rings, sweet potatoe fries or regular fries. It was all amazing so now I need to go back to try one of everything else on the menu! I especially liked that they had so many other options other than burgers! Turkey, chicken, salmon and lamb!! Something for everyone!!",

    "text": "When the Cosmo opened and I saw this menu, I knew I had to try it for their awesome burgers.  Once we were seated, I looked at the rest of the menu and decided that burgers were not the most interesting thing on there when I had Pork Belly buns and Lobster Rolls staring at me.  My wife got a burger and it was easily one of the top burgers I've ever had.  However, the star for me, was the Pork Belly buns.  Crunchy, salty, sweet and chewy all in a single bite.  It was heavenly and covered in a delicious hoisin sauce, balanced perfectly by a pillowy sticky bun that I wished would self-regenerate so it wouldn't disappear.  While we started our meal, we noticed a server prowling the restaurant with a bowl brimming with liquid nitrogen and the sort of smoke that you see in a sci-fi science lab.  He was serving freeze dried bubble gum meringue, for fun and free-of-charge.  \"Eat it fast,\" he said, dropping a 'kiss' shaped dessert into our hands, \"it's really cold.\"  We popped each playful \"kiss\" into our mouths and blew cold smoke rings as we crushed the delicate and flavorful meringue.  This single experience was enough for us to save room for the dessert menu.  Feeling glutinous and somewhat playful, we decided to try some of their more childish desserts.  We ordered a Cereal Bowl shake (which tasted exactly like a bowl of Captain Crunch, with premium ice cream and vodka) and something called an Ice Cream Truck, basically ice cream served 4 ways.  The chocolate bacon ice cream sandwich is something I will never forget.  Don't miss it!  The decor was very casual, with some leather booths, wooden paneling, hip music and pop art on the walls.  Atmosphere was loud and the crowd a varied mix of casual diners and pre-clubbers, all clearly attracted to the neon cow.  All-in-all an excellent experience and we will be returning asap!",

We were seated very quickly even though they said the wait was around 10-15 minutes.   I ordered the Korean \"bull\" gogi burger and was a little skeptical because it said it had a poached egg, and kimchi in it.  I actually don't like either of those but I thought this weekend was a good time to try something different.   It turned out DELICIOUS! It was a perfect/strange combination that REALLY worked!  The spiciness of the kimchi is very mild but hits you at the end.  And the poached egg (I think it was poached?? or maybe it was sunnyside up? I don't know, I don't know eggs very well...lol) just went really well with the burger.  I recommend EVERYONE try that one!   It came with shoestring fries which was also perfect.  I tried my friends Duck fat fries but I didn't see anything special in them.  But I also tried her strawberry milkshake and that was SO GOOD! I don't think any other shakes will taste as good as that one.    My only concern was their service.  When our waitress took our order, we must have waited 45 minutes before we even got our shake... Our waitress even asked us like 30 minutes in if we ordered the shake.  When we said yes, she said it was coming right out.  Liar.  I was just a little irked because the people who sat next to us, came in AFTER us and got their food BEFORE us! WTF?   But whatever, the food TOTALLY made up for it. =)  All in all, great place! Just needs to get their service upgraded.  4 Stars!",

I can't wait to come back and keep working my way down the list.  We went with a big group and were able to sample a few different burgers. I order the 'Gold Standard' which was epic. Loved the goat cheese. Friend across the table ordered the 'Longhorn' and we did a little burger swappage. The Longhorn was also excellent, and the brisket was fantastic. The star of the show for me though was when I sampled the 'Rising Sun'. It was literally an explosion of tastiness in my food hole. I had never heard of tempura avocado, much less considered putting it on a burger, but I think I'm going to put it on all my burgers from now on.  While the burgers all were exceptional, the fries were pretty ordinary. I ordered the duck fat fries myself and was underwhelmed. Not sure what I was expecting, but I thought they would be noticeably different than regular fries. They were tasty, just not different like I expected. I also tried some of the regular fried which were well... regular fries. I did manage to snag one onion ring from the spousal unit while she wasn't looking. Much better than the fries. Nice and crispy and cooked through to the inside.  As it was St Patrick's Day and we were busy drinking green beers and shots, we did not get around to sampling the shakes. I will put that on the agenda for the next visit(s).",

If you are gluten free, they have a GF bun or can wrap a patty in lettuce. Beware, the fries may not be GF since they share a fryer with other non-GF items. They also serve popcorn in lieu of a bread basket which I think is an interesting touch. Shakes looked amazing but I was too full to try one. The decor is super cute and fun.",

    "text": "I love that amongst all the hoity toity spots at the Cosmo, there's a laidback burger joint.  Don't get me wrong, my dirty martini still cost $20, but it's a nice casual spot to grab a bite if you don't feel like having a waiter set the napkin on your lap and you want to be able to watch sports at the bar without feeling like a jerk towards your date.  Our group of 7 showed up on a Saturday night, expecting a crazy house and a long wait because they don't take resos on the weekends, but surprisingly we were sat right away at a great table in the middle of the restaurant.    My date and I split a classic burger with bacon and cheddar (Lame, I know, but neither of us were that hungry),  as well as the calamari and some sweet potato fries.  Everything was really good.  The burger and calamari were good but nothing special.  The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were DELICIOUS!  Nothing fancy about them, just simple sweet potato fries that were perfectly crunchy on the outside and hot and yummy on the inside with a hint of saltiness to compliment it's natural sweet flavor.  MMmmmm!  This is a very fun and casual spot and you still feel like you're in the middle of all the excitement at Cosmo.    And though this is to be expected because it IS the Cosmo, our bill was was a LOT for what we ordered: $46 each, and we shared a burger. Wooo!",

Drinks were great and the hamburgers each if us had were fantastic.  Very tasty, cooked perfectly and massive.  Of course after the burgers of course we had to try the milkshakes.  Yummy!  We are going back to Vegas in late October and plan on returning.  Definitely worth the time and money.",

I can't wait to go back and actually try one of their \"bamboozled\" shakes.  Our table shared everything.  We started with the Artichoke \"guac,\" which was hummus mixed with artichokes and served with spicy pita chips.  It was awesome, would definitely order it again.  We also had the kettle chips, which come with french onion dip.  Although the rest of my party enjoyed them, I am not sure I would order them again.  For entrees we ordered the truffled lobster mac 'n cheese, which was absoulutely AMAZING!!  It was so delicious! We also had the Gold Standard Burger, which we also really enjoyed.  I think it could do without the bacon, which I didn't even notice, but the aged goat cheddar is a great touch.  I can't wait to go back and I really want to try the rest of the menu!",

It was the billionaire burger, which came with Kobe beef, black truffles and foie gras which is still legal everywhere else BUT California :(  I stepped up this already $30 burger and added a lobster tail on for an extra $10.   So what, Its not like I havnt already been throwing my money away in Vegas,    Verdict.

Good for a kid-friendly place on the strip. Good service. Also, you never have to wait too long. If you're debating between BurGR and Holstein's, BurGR has much longer waits, not as good service, and it's harder to get to (if you drive your car). The burgers are comparable with a little more refinement going to BurGR. However, BurGR has better fries (truffle) and shakes - OMG BurGR has good shakes, really more like dessert.

I asked for a water with lemon and a few moments to look over the menu. Water came back with no lemon. I got a very weird vibe from our waitress, like we annoyed her. I ordered the classic medium rare with American cheese and onion rings. My burger came back and when I cut the burger in half.. blood came out of the patty.. Definitely not medium rare, this was rare beyond belief. Since i was starving I did not want to make a commotion and send it back. Despite the patty being undercooked, the onion rings were delicious. My date had french fries and those were so good. If this review was strictly based on food I would give it 4 stars, minus one for the undercooked beef patty. The portions are enough to fill you up, and it had a casual atmosphere. I will go back, probably just ask for a medium cooked hamburger instead.  **reading other reviews, we did not get the complimentary popcorn either, that's a little disappointing.",

    "text": "**** 4.5 stars ****  One of the great miracles of Las Vegas is that you can eat like a fatty fat fat all day every day and still go to pools surrounded by gorgeous plastic-pumped women and sing nonsense like \"Sexy And I Know It\", regardless of any absence of truth to that assertion. Holsteins provides the perfect venue for stuffing your face on delicious patties of top quality beef while also getting an eye full of the local ladies. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the same chef is behind this as Public House, where I had dined the night before, and his love of squeezing his employees into clothing that might be mistaken for a table cloth was much more prominent here than there. The decor here is also just dope. I love the slightly sick toons on the walls, and there are homage to pigs and cows all around. If you look at most of the complaints here it's from people who didn't actually order a burger, so I suggest you take those reviews for what they are, and don't make the same mistake.  But, since it's Vegas, you will still stuff your face to the maximum in front of this beautiful bevy, knowing that you're helping to pay for their salary so that they can go to the pool tomorrow and pretend guys like you don't exist (until you buy them a pitcher of margaritas, then you're superstar hero of the next couple minutes, congrats). Brian and I both took the luxury route on the menu here, although I passed on the Billionaire Burger with Kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade and truffle mayo, because I've already had half a dozen burgers like this across America and they all taste roughly the same...rich and oily. It was honestly more difficult passing up the Rising Sun burger, a truly unique combination of Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado...super intriguing, and if I had been dining with someone I was dating I likely would have tried to persuade them in that direction. Somehow I managed to also resist ordering a decadent milkshake, perhaps because we were eating dinner just 4 hours after we had managed to roll out of bed for lunch.  I finally wound up deciding on the Gold Standard burger, a dry aged beef sirloin patty topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula and a garlic-chive aioli...nothing too crazy, but lots of big, bold, wonderful flavors, and at $18 the most expensive burger not topped with foie gras. The result was pretty fantastic, definitely one of the better burgers I've had lately, and came with a monstrous basket of nicely done sweet potato fries (for a supplemental charge). My biggest complaint, which is kind of random, is that they skewer the burgers with their own stupid little logo stick to keep the bun on for presentation, which has the resulting effect of causing huge gobs of mayo or sauce to squirt from the hole in the top every time you take a bite. Eating these burgers is a mess, to be sure, especially when you add on a fried egg as I do, but if you're like me you've already realized you're not taking one of the voluptuous vixens home (although my reason is probably different than yours) so you've resigned your face to more indulgent pleasures, like egg yolk, garlic aioli, and hamburger grease.  Just make sure to thoroughly wash your beard, or your own lady might catch on...and get jealous.",

I had the Virgin Campfire Shake, which was DELISH! I didn't have a burger because I had eaten previously but I am definitely coming back to try one. My friend ordered a burger and it looked SOOOOOOOOOOO good. I was jealous.   TRY IT OUT!",

    "text": "I had 2 1/2 meals here (the \"1/2\" was a quick appetizer I grabbed) while staying at the Cosmopolitan this past weekend, and it's definitely a solid spot.   I came here twice for lunch and both meals were yummy! First time I had some sort of \"Korean quesadilla.\" Honestly, this was probably my least favorite thing I had here. It wasn't bad, but there was a couple different types of sauce on it, and I thought they kind of overpowered things. I was the only one who didn't get a burger during this meal, but I nibbled on some fries of those who did (sweet potato and steak fries) & they were yummy!   For the second lunch I had to try a spiked shake & it was DELICIOUS! I had the one that was supposed to taste like \"cereal\" and it did! I don't know if this is True or not, but I was informed by our waitress that this is one of only two places in the US (maybe the world?) that serves this shake. I also bad some delicious buffalo wings (just the right amount of sauce w/the right amount of kick) & some Polish sausage sliders (the red peppers were a nice touch).  Everything was great!   For my \"half\" meal I had the \"hummus guacamole.\" This isn't what I was expecting (it was chunkier than I thought), but still tasted good. It came w/a lot of pita chips.   The service here was excellent on each occasion. Holsteins is located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan (while most of the other restaurants are located on the 3rd floor) and is a little more casual, and therefore it bit cheaper than other restaurants.   Even though this is pretty standard in Vegas another nice thing about this restaurant is you can get to-go cups for alcohol. One night while wondering around the hotel I just popped in at the bar and got a \"Dragon\" cocktail in a to-go cup. This drink is one of the many at Holsteins that is made w/Vitamin water. It's yummy...and um...healthy?",

Also, the prices were reasonable in comparison to the usual Vegas strip prices. Overall, I'd probably come here again for the shakes but I'd pass on the veggie burger.  Note to restaurant: I know you are a traditional burger joint but you only have one veggie burger option on your menu. Really? Why not give the vegetarians a little more variety? Black bean burger, brown rice burger... start catering a little more to the veg heads.",

    "text": "My girl friends and I kicked off our Vegas weekend with a late and light lunch at Holsteins.  I was salivating when I saw Billionaire burger ($28) on the menu with kobe beef, foie gras, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo, but I decided that the Hen House burger ($14) was good enough for half the price with its fried egg and bacon.  That is, until our server highly recommended the award winning Gold Standard burger ($17.50) with dry aged beef, bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic chive aioli.  It was done--I would eat the winner.  Although complex and tasty, the Gold Standard didn't make me shake my buns or roll my eyes backwards.  I didn't care for the fancy stuff like goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, or baby arugula.  For a gourmet burger, Umami Burger (multiple locations in LA and one in SF) is my gold standard and it's about 2/3 of the prices here.  I did, however, enjoy the shoestring fries at Holsteins.  They're skinny, crisp, wonderful, and plentiful.    If you have a car in Vegas, you should make the trek to Bachi Burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bachi-burger-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/bachi-burge...</a>).  Now there's a burger joint worthy of being called the best burger in Sin City.",

    "text": "Pretty good place located in the Cosmopolitan for a great tasting burger. While I don't believe it's at the same level as BurGR by Gordon Ramsey in Planet Hollywood, they still offer delicious burgers and shakes, nonetheless, and should definitely be given a shot!  The Place - As I mentioned, Holstein's is located in The Cosmopolitan and is centrally located with everything else. It's fairly easy to find and doesn't require a great deal of navigation. Casino's in Vegas can tend to be very large and trying to find a restaurant within one is a challenge within itself, but Holstein's wasn't too hard to spot. At first glance, the place itself looks like a glorified cafe as the restaurant is very open in terms of people on the outside of the restaurant being able to look in. The decor is pretty modern, the bar is a pretty good size, and there's also, what seemed to be an impromptu, lounge area right in front of the bar for people to come in, sit on couches and socialize while still being able to enjoy the menu and the drinks. The lounge being right in front of the bar didn't look all that comfortable and appealing; however, with the right group of people and the right amount of drinks, I'm sure it would be fine for most haha. Because I sat at the bar, I didn't get a chance to see the rest of the restaurant; however, the kitchen looks to be exposed so that people can look in on the action going on at the back of the house and, as a customer, that's always interesting and nice to see. Not too bad, Holstein's. **** 4/5 Stars ****  The Service - I was in Vegas for a conference and I came to Holstein's right after the last session ended, which was around 5:00pm or so on a Thursday. There, unfortunately, was no hostess to greet me; however, I chalk that up to them being particularly busy and probably running around. No biggie on my end as I was gonna end up sitting at the bar anyways, which I did; however, if I was a party hoping to get a table, having no hostess at the front would certainly make me question. I found an open seat at the bar and immediately by one of the most friendliest faces I've seen during my visit in Vegas. She was entertaining, down to earth, willing to talk with everyone at the bar, and wasn't afraid to razzle folks to try and get them to smile, which I didn't mind at all. The great service continued throughout with her making sure I was taken care of and when she had to leave for the day she made every effort to make sure I was ok and gave the next bartender updates on all her guests, which is always nice to see rather than someone leaving the next person in the dark. Great service, Holstein's and shout out to Bridgot for making my trip to Holstein's wonderful!! ***** 5/5 Stars *****  The Food - Just like any other of the burger joints located in Vegas, there are many different options to choose from. Each burger has its own signature ingredient and level of appeal for everyone. With that being said, it'll be pretty difficult for someone to NOT find a burger that sounds delicious as there are many different burgers to indulge in. I settled for the Nom Nom Burger (See Picture) and decided to have that served with some onion rings instead of fries. First, the onion rings. Definitely not the best onion rings I've had in my life as you can probably tell they just came from a bag in the freezer; however, it got the job done and satisfied my craving for them. The Nom Nom Burger, which is kobe beef, cheddar cheese, 1000 Island Dressing, and potato chips (yes...potato chips....don't lie and say you never put potato chips in your cold cut sandwiches as a kid....I don't care who you are, EVERYONE did that and you would swear it was the best thing ever! Haha). The burger was perfectly cooked, the cheddar cheese and 1000 Island Dressing gave it that zest and creaminess it needed and then finally, the homemade potato chips, as it did in cold cut sandwiches, gave that textural difference and crunchiness that we always desire in our food. The only gripe I have about the potato chips is that there was no flavor to them, it was literally just there for the crunch, I wish they would've seasoned them with something to make it pop more. Other than that, I was fairly satisfied with my selection. Good job, Holstein's. **** 4/5 Stars ****  Overall - Like I said, after comparing the burgers that I've had from BurGR to Holstein's, I would definitely choose BurGR; however, if you happen to be in The Cosmo and the mood for having a burger strikes you, this place can definitely deliver. I look forward to coming back and trying out the other options like The Gold Standard Burger, but all in all, not too shabby Holstein's! Thanks!",

I prefer the GR burg. I've been to Holsteins twice now and both times have thought that the burgers are decent but nothing special.   The shakes are really good and I think taste a lot better than those at GR. But the \"spiked\" aspect is just a gimmick. There's virtually no alcohol. In fact id say that they can legally serve these shakes at an elementary school. Also should note that they are pricey at $13.   The fries are really bad. I'd recommend substituting sweet potato fries (for $2.5)",

    "text": "My first meal after landing in Vegas. Couldn't have chosen a better spot! I've heard great things of Holsteins from a source that winds up in Vegas a lot for business and this also made their list of must eats when they're in town. What is more comforting than shakes and buns in your belly..that came out strange..it sounded a lot sweeter in my head. On to Holsteins goodness!  Luckily when we came down from our room there was no wait when we walked over to Holstein's and it was already poppin' at the bar lounge area. Once we got sat down we were greeted with a bucket of spicy, cheesy popcorn which was a yummy introduction. I had the Cereal Bowl 2.0 shake that had 3 Olives Loopy Vodka, Vanilla Ice Cream, Fruit Loops, and Cap'n Crunch blended into a beautiful oblivion (yeah I dropped a Eve 6 line..please be friends with me still! haha) My Bam-Boozled Shake was delightful. Usually Vodka is my kryptonite, apparently when you add ice cream and cereal it's the perfect combo for a non-Asian inferno.   For starters we got an order of Fried Pickle Spears. They were golden, delicious, and chock full of hot dill juice. Just couldn't wait to dive in and wound up with dripping pickle juice everywhere. It was worth it though because they were tasty as heck!  My burger decision was pretty easy. I got The Rising Sun Burger to commemorate planning our trip to Japan in December (which I am super excite to Yelp from as well! Fingers crossed I learn enough Japanese by then! ^__^) The Rising Sun had a slew of delicious including kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. The burger was perfectly medium and the crunch from the furikake and crispy yam blended into the slight crispy and buttery smooth tempura avocado.  Since my Cereal Bowl 2.0 was basically dessert I passed on dessert time. I will gladly drop in to Holstein's Shakes & Buns for another round of amazing Shakes & Buns which is what my buns did as I giddily bounced in my chair with every tasty sip and bite.",

    "text": "This would've been a solid 4 star rating because the food was delicious but the customer service totally ruined our dinner.  Had a friend in town so I suggested to come here. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. With over 2000 reviews, I'm not going to bore you too much with details.   Couple things: -you can order your burger how you want it. Well done meat for me please. -burgers were delicious! My friend and I both ordered the Gold Standard. Not a fan of goat cheese but paired with arugula and that garlic aoli dressing....yum!!!! -all burgers comes with French fries. Sweet potato fries and onion rings costs extra. -Yes, my burger cost $18.50. Yes, it was pricey but it IS at The Cosmopolitan and this is typical Vegas Strip pricing.  Now, customer service was the only bad highlight of the night. Our server, TIFFANI, (yes spelled with an I) was a horrible server. Not only did I have to remind her MULTIPLE times to re-fill our drinks, but she acted like my friend and I were the blame when SHE was the one who switched our burgers around when she dropped them off at our table. My friend ordered hers medium rare and mine well done. It was traumatizing for me to bite into a red, bloody burger!!!!!!! We told her what happened and she gave us a blank stare. What she said to us next was unbelievable! She had the nerve to tell us, \"well since you guys got the same kind of burgers....do you just want to switch plates?\" SWITCH PLATES!?!?!  Are you serious!? Yeah, like my friend would want a spat-out, bit-into burger. The nerve of this bi*tch. All she had to do was take the plates back. It's not like her dumba$$ was back there in the kitchen making these burgers in the first place. Thinking about this again, is making me upset. I shouldn't even have left a tip for her. And my friend wanted to give her 20%. Ha!! I stopped her right there. Tiffani should've gotten $0.00 in tips.   Management, if you ever read this, you should get rid of TIFFANI. Or at least speak to her on how to properly be a good server. Teach her a thing or two about customer service.",

    "text": "Holsteins is an incredible burger joint in Vegas and I would definitely recommend going there.   My friends and I were seated almost instantly. We pondered over the menu and struggled to pick our favorite burger because of all of the tasty options. I decided on the steakhouse burger and I also got a free Holsteins lager just for checking in on Yelp! The beer came out quickly and it was a nice light lager similar to a light Mexican beer. I tried not to finish it before the burger came out so I could enjoy them together.   When my burger came out with the sweet potato fries, I took a bite and the flavors worked extremely well together. The burger was juicy and tasty, the cheese melted right on and the mushrooms and tomatoes topped it off. It took me a while to finish it as I tried to savor every bite. The sweet potato fries were large and soft but still had a nice crisp to them. They were tasty but not incredible. My friends onion rings were amazing and I would definitely get those when I eat here again.   Holsteins is a very good burger place. The prices are a little bit high but it is in Vegas so you can't really complain. The burger was incredibly cooked and I was very satisfied and full from the meal. Overall a great place to grab a burger with your friends in Vegas.",

Burger was excellent - thick and juicy with a side of fries, or upgrade to sweet potato/ring.  Portion is small (aka Vegas style, smaller than a Big Mac), so my advise is to order 2 if you're feeling ravenous.  Ended up following with Secret Pizza, but that turned out great as well.",

Holstein's is a convenient after Marquee Pool Party stop, definitely shareable burgers or big enough to fill a single person up. The burgers were juicy, and they offer a diverse array of cocktails, beers, and milkshakes! I liked that you could grab a seat without waiting in any lines, and that the service was polite and quick.  * Hen House ($15) - 4.5 STARS: Beef With Fried Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato And Onion With Mustard & Ketchup. This was probably my favorite burger, even though it is so simple. Ordered medium rare, ofcourse.  * The Longhorn ($17) - 3.5 STARS: Beef Patty Topped With Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickle. I thought for sure this would take the cake, but there was alot going on. Sometimes simple is the best way to go.  * Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese ($16.5) - 4 STARS: Creamy Tallegio-Mascarpone Sauce With Maine Lobster And Black Truffle. This was uber cheesy and truffly. Kind of expensive for the size but a nice small plate to share.",

    "text": "First,  we were seated pretty quick.  It was a Friday just before lunchtime so I appreciate that.  And that's about the best thing about this whole experience.  As soon as we were seated, we were asked about drinks.  Two people in our party ordered beer and the other two ordered water.  The beer came within 10 minutes.  The waters were served to us about 20 minutes later.  We asked 4 other staff members who WEREN'T our server (couldn't find him) for water and nothing.  Finally we thought if we order beer then maybe we'll get it before the water too?  Our beers came out WITH our water.  Now 30 minutes past being seated.  We managed to place our order when the beer came out.  Ordered a veggie patty, a Caesar salad and a well-done classic burger.  Our food didn't take nearly as long as our water to arrive and I understand why. When the \"well-done\" burger was but into,  it was more like cool blue and dripping with blood.  Not pinkish meat juice, it was dark red beef blood.  We flagged our waiter down and told him about it and he took the plate.  Our guest however was turned off from eating a burger like that and asked if she could order the sliders.  We were told no because it's for kids only.  Our server had his manager come over to explain that despite the raw ground beef our friend was just served he wasn't going to bend company policy and serve her sliders.    We received no apologies from anyone, especially the manager who seemed to enjoy being as rude as he could over his kitchens failure.    Between the service and the raw burger,  I can say this place was the skid mark of our vacation.  I gave this place 2 stars for the veggie patty and Caesar.  Those were pretty standard tasting.",

It was just funny because we were just at Marquee the night before so it was almost as if we had stayed there.  To begin, they bring you free popcorn (that is somewhat addicting!) in a little bucket. Not only is that unique, but a good alternative to free bread. We weren't in the mood for anything alcoholic so we skipped on the milk shakes (maybe for next time). He got the Rising Sun burger with fries and I got the Gold Standard with fries. Both very delicious meals! I was really happy with my choice because I could just taste the dry aged sirloin. It is such a nice combo with the arugula and the goat cheese. As for the Rising Sun burger, the teriyaki glaze is a nice touch. We both thought the pricing was a bit much, but then again, it IS vegas.....  Our server Kenny was attentive and friendly as well.",

However, we went on Monday night this week around 630pm.  We were worried there would be a huge wait, but it only took a couple of minutes to get seated.    We were pretty hungry so once we were seated we ordered both onion rings and fried pickles.  I've never had fried pickles and while they were tasty, I don't think its something I would order again.  I liked the crunchy onion rings...just lamented that there were so many!  The food runner who brought them out proudly announced that he tried to stack them as high as they could.  Really though?  It was LOT and there were only 3 of us!    I had to decide whether I wanted to drink my calories or eat them, and I decided in favor of chewing versus sipping.  I passed on the adult milkshakes, though many of them looked tempting.  I ordered the fun-ghi burger which was really delicious.  Piping hot burger, with yummy mushrooms and cheese.  It was a great combination.  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their burgers as well.  I ordered sweet potato fries with this burger, but seriously?  Who could eat that when the burgers filled you up!    This is a really great little spot and  although you pay more than you would for an average burger, we all felt this was way above the average.  Definitely worth the money and experience.  Give it a try!  It's on my repeat list for my next Vegas visit in October.",

    "text": "As a cow collector, the huge pink cow caught my attention, but aside from that, every other restaurant had a huge wait due to CES so we came here for dinner.   Food:  We ordered a bunch of tapas to share and also to try different dishes. We ordered:  french fries cooked in duck fat: the fries tasted good, but the texture  threw me off. It wasn't crispy as I expect them to be. Not sure if it's the way it's cooked or not, but I'll try it out again next time.  crispy pork belly bun: who doesn't love pork belly? very good!  tenderloin roissini: very moist and was mixed with fois gras which made it even better!!  main lobster roll: wish we ordered more, it was delicious!  toscana with italian sausage: it was okay, but nothing special  Our waiter suggested the artichoke dip which she claimed to be the best. I beg to differ. It was nothing special. The pita chips that came with it looked like it was from the bottom of the bag.   Overall, the food was great, service was okay, but the ambiance was too loud for my taste. I left a little deaf.",

    "text": "After reading many yelpers raving about this place, the girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot.  The pink cow didn't hurt too (how can you turn away a pink cow?!? she says)  Location:  Located in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel right outside of Marquee nightclub, this joint is in a prime spot to see and be seen in.  Definite positive points in my book.  Atmosphere:  The top 40s music really gets your heart pumping and is very fitting for a Cosmo hotel food establishment.  I honestly didn't take much notice to the artwork and aesthetic elements of the restaurant.  Very pop modern feel without being too noisy or overbearing.  There is a bar and lounge area at the front if your in the mood for a more casual mingling time with knee high tables and LCD tvs behind the bar.  Beyond that is the regular dining portion of the restaurant.  Food:   -Fried pickles -\"Rising sun burger\" -Sweet potato fries -Shoestring fries  Fried pickles baby!  Money. Ok honestly this was the first time I had fried pickles in my life, and well I am a DIE HARD pickle lover (so really any sort of pickles would be great), these were pretty bomb.  They give you a little tin with some breaded fried pickles in them, fried olives, and caper berries!  What is a caper berry? Yes first time I have come across one myself (like ash finding a new pokemon I guess? kinda puzzling, yet exciting).  But yah, it was pretty darn good.  I was kinda sad that there were only a few of them (about 5-6 wedges of pickles, 2 olives, 2 caper berries), but they were good, while they lasted. :(  Also there was a small assortment of deli meats (salami, ham, prosciutto) which seemed like an odd pairing with the fried items, but they were a a nice tasty tid bit before our meal came.  We both having similar tastes, the gf and I ordered \"The Rising Sun\" burger.  To be honest, the server who brought our burgers out said this was the best burger in his opinion on the menu.  (I'll be the judge of that myself sir, lol).  Well this burger was seriously a masterpiece in of itself.  Kobe beef patty with a Teri Glaze, brought me back to Punahou carnival days (if your from hawaii and know what im talking about), and on top of that you get the little shredded yam crispies adding color and a little bit of sweetness to the burger, nori furikake inside, with a generous piece of fried avocado, again giving another element of texture and creaminess to your bite.  Then for the finale, the spicy mayo spread on the bun (like the kine you get with spicy tuna sushi), is like a ninja just hiding there as you gaze at all the other elements of the burger, waiting to make its presence known.  This my friend gives you that zing of heat (without being overpowering) that really brings all these flavors together, and for me this spicy mayo was the winnaz.  Quite honestly one (if not the) best burger i've had the honor to come across in my life.  You also get your choice of bun (white or wheat).  Both of which are quite tasty, as I got the white and the gf got the wheat, really can't go wrong with either.  They come with your choice of fries: shoestring or steak-cut.  I didn't want to copy the gf as I wanted the shoestring, so I convinced her to ask to upgrade to sweet potato fries.  They come in little mock fry-baskets which is a thumbs up for presentation.  For the taste of each of the fries, both were VERY good, would definitely recommend either in a heartbeat.  Also they give you a nice amount of fries which is always great!  Price:  Ok so this is always the boohoo side of a vegas story, but honestly people it is vegas and yes $16-17 bucks for a designer burger is on the steep side for most people, but it is in my honest opinion worth it.  Verdict:  Holsteins presents itself as a hip, modern burger/diner type joint in the heart of the new cosmopolitan hotel.  It's decor and atmosphere really mesh well with the feel of the hotel itself and the food it presents.  You really get what you pay for in my opinion, a great designer burger, one that you quite honestly could not find anywhere else.  In comparison, for $16-17 I would take it over BLT's Wagyu beef burger & Max Brenner's Kobe burger any day for the same price range.  It's definitely a place to check out if you're in the moooOOd for some good burgers!  (They are known for their shakes too, but we didnt get to try them as the idea of a shake first thing in the morning after a long night clubbing didn't quite fit the agenda, if you know what I mean)",

The Gold Standard burger rocked my socks off.  Definitely comparable to Father's Office and other good LA burger joints.  Loved the steak fries (skinny fries could've been better - a little too dry).  Complimentary truffle popcorn from the chef?  Heck yeah!  To top it all off, I must commend the service.  Our waitress was super knowledgeable about the beers available, she was friendly, checked up on us at the right times, and was just really nice and helpful overall (cannot remember her name, but she was blond....) At \"hip\" places I tend to hate the waiters because they're douches/rude, but this was not the case!",

So right away I was put off by the drunk and obnoxious, fist pumpers. Now I know that has nothing to do with the restaurant but I think the commotion rubbed off on our hostess because she had a slight attitude. We were seated fairly quickly, and I was hoping that it wouldn't be so loud inside the restaurant.....I was wrong. It was so loud I truly couldn't talk to people sitting next to me. Frustrating. Onto the food....for starters we ordered the lobster Mac & Cheese, pretty tasty, would order again, perfect amount of flavor and not too salty. Fried pickles, I liked the pickles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the herb-caper mayo, would've been better with ranch. I split the Gold Standard burger, ordered medium well, they actually got the medium well perfect which I appreciate, I couldn't decide if I loved the burger. I don't like meat on meat (i.e bacon on my burger) but the description of the burger sounded delicious, so I don't know if it was the goat cheese or the aioli dressing that threw me off. I was too full to try the milk shakes, unfortunately.   Don't know if I would come back, I am still a Bachi Burger fan.",

    "text": "So, I'm a vegetarian but we wound up here post Billboard Music Awards after staggering around trying to hail a cab. Hailing a cab in Vegas apparently requires a guidebook.  Despite the cow house that Holsteins is, they have an \"Urth burger\". *giggle*  The ambiance is pretty tan and nonviolent. Yes there's a big pink cow off the side when you walk in but beyond that, it doesn't scream STEAKHOUSE! in your face. There are little white outlined cows on glass partitions between booths but it's otherwise rustic mod, casual dining.   We had no reservations but were seated promptly. It took awhile for the waitress to greet us, but to be fair we were probably extra anxious because we had just sat through three hours of the BMAs and were about to eat the table.  As other Yelpers mentioned the food did come out pretty quick after we ordered. A little weird if I think everything is kinda sitting there udder (get it?) warmers but we were hungry so... whatevs.  The macaroni w/truffle was divine. Order it. The modest portion is good to eat alone, or nicer if you share it.   Everyone else seemed to enjoy their pulled pork bites, meatballs, guac, and sweet potato fries.  My Urth Burger was HUGE. It didn't taste like a Morning Star, Boca or any other patty I've tried. That's usually a good thing because it means it's homemade, but I would be surprised if was here. A completely fine vegetarian option.   The cider here is popular. They ran out of two types. There are crazy shakes on the menu that I'll have to try the next time I return.",

My wife and I split the Nom Nom Burger (Kobe beef, potato chips, thousand island dressing) thinking it would be something we couldn't find somewhere else.  The beef patty was overcooked and did not seem to be seasoned.  The potato chips were a nice touch and appeared to be made in house.  The hamburger was simply lacking flavor.  I'll say that we enjoyed the french fries that came with the hamburger (and all hamburgers at Holsteins.)  The beer selection was admirable and allowed me to an IPA that I've not had before.  Too bad for you that I can't remember the name.  Overall, I think that I'd go back because I got the feeling that they could do better.  Casual, relatively affordable and average from most angles.  A safe bet if you are already in The Cosmopolitan, but not worth a special trip.",

It was escalated to the manager who also informed us that we were the ones in the wrong. The Fat Boy was designed to be a surprise mix of ingredients (which makes sense considering the title). Change the menu to provide an accurate description! The service obviously left a lot to be desired.",

I probably would give this place a better review, but I'm still annoyed by how unbelievably loud the dining room was because it's across from the Marquee nightclub. My friends and I wanted to chat, but we couldn't without yelling at each other across our table. In the end, the loud music from Marquee gave us all headaches and destroyed our appetites.  We ordered the duck fat fries, the baked smashed potatoes, the asian pork belly buns and a regular hamburger. The duck fat fries were OK; in retrospect not worth the price ($7?) because I could barely taste any difference. The pork belly buns were also just OK; they could have used more pork belly, less buns, and a lot more sauce. They were pretty tasteless considering how thick the buns were. My friend's smashed potatoes were cheesy bacon-y goodness, so no qualms there.  One of my friends also ordered the s'mores drink, which she described as a dressed up mudslide. Is that worth $9-14? I don't think so.",

The rising sun comes with a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and the best part: tempura avocado! I added a fried egg to mine which tied the all the flavors together with its gooey albeit messy goodness. At close to $20 for a burger, this thing was definitely on the pricey side but I would definitely be back to try more of their delectable offerings. I also tried some of the tiramisu alcoholic shake. These things are huge, and can easily be split amongst 2 or even 3 people. The only other gripe I have is that we were seated in a lounge type area, probably because we had a large party, but it made it difficult to handle a messy burger cause the table was more of a lower coffee table than a dining one. I found myself having to lean my back awkwardly far forward so my burger didn't get all over the place.",

The ingredients are spot on and the flavor is not overpowering. Anytime I go to vegas I will stop by for one of these shakes they make you think other shakes are child's play.  We also ordered fries they were fine.  So go for the shakes. If you don't drink alcohol they will nix the alcohol for you.",

The highest quality ingredients, matched together impeccably, and served in a gorgeous restaurant at a luxe spot on the Las Vegas strip with art by a fantastic local artist. Perfection!  I got the Gold Standard - to think of what I experienced with each bite brings tears to my eyes, it was beautiful! I also experienced the fried pickles (a MUST have), country fried bacon and the pork buns. Bring friends, split the appetizers and spring for the burger. You won't regret it.   Finish things off with one of their amazing shakes - I had the Tira Misu, and I will absolutely be back for another.   The staff are uber friendly and definitely knowledgeable. The prices aren't In N Out Burger, but they aren't Strip Steak, either. Right in the middle where they should be. The Gold Standard burger was $17.95 and worth double that.   We'll be back, Holsteins. Oh yes, we will be back.",

    "text": "I dropped by Holsteins Shakes and Buns knowing that their Burgers and Shakes were awfully good.  Friends of mine have been recommending it and the pics on yelp were pretty convincing.  I came in for a late lunch so they had me sit at the bar.  I'm not a big fan of sitting at the bar to eat so that instantly turned me off when they offered it to me, but the bartender was pretty helpful.  Based off my friend's recommendation (Jesiree B.), I ordered the Rising Sun Burger (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2wgwTAz&s=2ed94470437132e1d76d3b67b1c2e93b7776f2e18c9092b1c02c14191b420e1d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2wgwTAz</a>)- Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, and Tempura Avocado.  The Burger was cooked really good and all the toppings worked well together.  I loved the Crispy Yams which gave the Burger a nice flavorful crunch.  I thought the Tempura Avocado was a bit much though and didn't exactly go well with the Teriyaki Glaze.  Good burger overall though, it had it's very own distinct look and taste.  And the Skinny Fries that came with it were crispy and seasoned very well.  The Black Cow Float was incredible and actually became the highlight of my meal (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2wfqRAw&s=a54b015f1499419481f8292afbb2d6a1d2cee79a401931b9068fdd13761cf6f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2wfqRAw</a>) - Coca-Cola,  Vanilla Ice Cream, Cherry Vodka, and Chocolate Covered Pop Rocks!  It was a explosion of flavor in my mouth, literally!!  It could be because I'm a little late to the Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola party since it was the first time I've had the infamous combo.  It worked well though as an Ice Cream Float.  I actually wanted to order another one!  In an already crowded Gourmet Burger market on the Strip with Burger Bar, KGB, BLT, and Le Burger Brasserie, it's nice to see that Holsteins can easily contend well against them with their own creative spin on Burgers and Shakes.  I will definitely come back again!",

    "text": "I've eaten at a lot of nice burger places in my life, living in SF (Umami Burger, Burger Bar, Roam Burger) and the burger I had at Holsteins was the best burger I've had. This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1/3 of the price and 3 times better.  There were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch.   My only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.  Each bite was perfection - my mouth is salivating thinking about this meal. I haven't eaten a lot of burgers in Las Vegas, but I don't need to try any other places - I'll just keep coming back here to repeat this burger and new ones.",

We sat in the lounge area because there isn't much of a wait compared to the table dining area. Our waitress wasn't very good though. She never really checked on us and took forever to give us our tab, but I rarely base my ratings on the service.  ---FOOD---- and cocktail-----  TIRAMISU / 11 Mascarpone Ice Cream, Ladyfinger Crumbs, Patron Xo Cafe Dark, Chocolate Syrup, Cocoa Powder, Espresso Beans  Love how they give you a whole extra shake pretty much leftover, so it's definitely a shareable drink for sure! And enjoyed the little cookie garnish too ;0 why thank u!  GOLD STANDARD* / 17.5 Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli  The goat cheese and tomato confit made this burger worth the price! Well almost worth the price. I either was super hungry or a Holstein Heifer! I ate the whole thing! yup! Don't be fooled by my 113lb ass! Oh and I added avocado and a fried egg!!! yup! I did that!  EL MACHETE* / 16 Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli  My friend got this one which was spicy-deliciously just as tasty as mine.   If I stay at the Cosmo---Or if you stay at he Cosmo pweeze check this place out. Get out of your room, don't bother ordering room service, walk your hungover ass over here, go straight to the bar and order a beer and look at their menu. WOrth it!",

    "text": "First thing to remember about Holstein's is their menu is reflected by the time of day (a very important tip to avoid frustration). I went late night and expected a full menu, but was told instead it was their late night menu so that was a nice segway to drink and have \"finger food\" as I called it. That would've been nice to know over the phone prior to making the trek over there.  I decided to drain my frustrations in a spicy bloody mary and I'll be damned if it wasn't as advertised. Clamato with jock itch is more like it, but either way it did tickle the taste buds quite well and I HATE spicy! We also had ordered the lobster mac n cheese (2 by accident) and it was hit or miss. The first one was beyond salty and the 2nd one was spot on and the bread crumb crust was a delight down the pipes! We also did try the surf n turf quesadilla which was small, but delectable!  Disappointed with things we decided to go the day after for lunch. As a \"preflight\" meal, they gave us salt and vinegar popcorn which I wolfed down! I really thought to myself GROSS, but upon chomping away all I could say was YES YES YES! I felt Rockafeller so I dove into the billionaire burger and that was by far the best burger I have ever had. I ordered it medium rare after watching the food channel and from bun to bun the taste was nothing but fun! It was juicy, the foie gras and truffle mayo was a True jackpot!   To top it off you must must get an alcoholic milkshake as well to wash down the meal. I had the campfire smore and it's one of the many things in life that make you go hmm. If you don't make this a stop on your Vegas outing you forever will be square and not there!",

    "text": "This place was definitely a last minute choice as we needed food and that cow mascot made us think this was a quick bite to eat. A bit misleading in that regard because it was a full bar/sit down restaurant with some burger choices.   Still a fun time and the popcorn was surprisingly good. The Truffle mac and cheese was delicious and the truffle at times was overpowering, it was still lighter than other truffle mac and cheeses that we had tried. There was this one time where our truffle mac and cheese tasted like we were biting into a truffle and there was no other flavors. With that said, this one wasn't all that bad. I had the veggie burger, which was perfectly fine. It was hard to eat at times as it was slipping here and there, but still all good. The sweet potato fries were the perfect complement to alcohol. It was greasy, but not too greasy and they were healthier than regular fries. What could go wrong. We ordered extra.... and another extra of the sweet potato fries. Loved it that much. I do like the decor here as it was on the darker side as if you were in a higher end restaurant, but at the same time, a colorful cow mascot, which makes you think you walked into a family restaurant. A bit confusing from time to time, but as long as the food kept our stomachs happy, this was still a good choice for a quick bite.",

Tess was great, she was super friendly and made sure everything was going good when we got our food, after we had started eating and then before we left. She got our orders correct and got our shakes out to us quickly. I had the Gold Standard burger & the Frozen Grasshopper shake.  Tess explained the Gold Standard as 'basically a bacon cheeseburger but with better ingredients' which was a spot on comparison. The patty was thick and had plenty of melted goat cheddar cheese on top, they were also very generous with the baby arugula on the burger which I liked.  I was a little disappointed with the shake, only because I couldn't really taste the alcohol (I assume this is why they have an extra shot offer for $3 more). The shake had a variety of fun garnish and was very filling. The flavor stayed True to the mint theme of the drink without being over powering.   We had an accident with a glass of water and someone's shoe which the restaurant staff handled promptly and graciously, so that didn't hurt our experience of the restaurant at all.",

He was one of those that came around at the perfect time to either give us refills, ask us how our meal was going, or even the simple things like getting our check taken care of but then not rushing us out of the restaurant (as there did seem like there was a wait to get seated and the restaurant was packed).  We came at 11am for an early lunch on a weekday but by the time we left at 12:45 it sure was heating up.  We each ordered our own burger and a beer and also added the oreo and peanut butter boozy milkshakes at the end.  As you can probably tell we were extremely full but we pushed through due to the overall deliciousness.  The meal began with complimentary pizza seasoned popcorn and then our burgers and beers were next.  We each ordered a different burger (gold standard, rising sun, and caliente) and each added a fried egg (because why not).  The upgrade price for the sides was a little excessive at $2.50 for a side salad substitution, already on top of a $20 burger, but it is what it is.  Each burger was great and definitely required a fork and knife once the egg broke.  The milkshakes were a spectacle.  Not much booze in them but delicious nonetheless.  They really are a sight and sharable as you get the milkshake in all its glory in the main glass plus extra milkshake liquid on the side.  This is one of the better upscale burgers in Vegas.  It certainly matches the likes of Bobby Flay and Gordon Ramsay elsewhere on the strip.  Great venue for a long lunch to meet up with acquaintances on the strip.",

    "text": "Being part of the Cosmopolitan raised the bar pretty high in terms of expectations. We decided to walk in because it was just before lunch time and figured it would be easy to get a table. Place was pretty empty when we got there, but the hostess gave us the impression that we were somewhat intruding. The interior design of the restaurant quickly helped get past the awkward arrival. In terms of food, as the title suggests you have a pretty large variety of burgers, shakes and beer - make sure you try their signature lager, I loved it. A really nice touch was that we received a small complimentary bucket of popcorn.  As a starter we went with the Poutine. Canadians would have lost their mind (in case you don't know, they are defensive of this dish): thinly cut fries and crunchy all the way, gravy on the side & some tasteless shredded short rib. I don't mind the gravy on the side bit but I wouldn't have ordered it if I had known I would be getting regular fries with cheese and some poorly seasoned meat on top.  For the main dish I decided to go with the signature Gold Standard and my wife went with The Classic. We asked both the burgers to be medium but we were in for a surprise. In a city like Vegas you can't ask a person how they would like their meat to be cooked and then get it wrong. My burger was medium-well (emphasis on the well) which I can accept. But the fact that my wife's one was rare all the way I can't. I'm surprised she didn't want to send it back. I cannot complain about the overall taste of the burger - the bacon and smoked goat cheddar really bring it to the Gold Standard.  There was another small incident that bugged me. The waiter that was responsible for collecting empty glassware was a bit over zealous. He first came to our table and reached for the popcorn bucket which was still half full and my wife was still enjoying it. He did ask if he could take it but with the hand already onto it. Because of the noise he understood that we were ok with him taking it. That really wasn't a problem because it can happen to any of us, but what came next really annoyed me. I still had 2 fingers worth of beer in my glass and in a slight moment in which I wasn't paying attention he came again and took the glass without asking. By the time I realized that he had taken it he was already too far. I found this to be impolite and unprofessional. The devil is in the details guys and unfortunately I was expecting both the food and the quality of service to excel.  I'm not trying to discourage anyone from having a meal here. The interior design is really nice and the food was tasty. It's just the small details I outlined which shaved off 2 stars off my review.  I will be back and update my review in case it was just a bad day.",

To start things off we ordered the Korean 'Bulgogi' Quesadilla. We certainly did not need an appetizer, but it sounded to good to pass up. It comes stuffed with marinated steak, kimchi, asadero cheese, chili aioli & kalbi glaze. Luckily it tastes as good as it sounds. It is good for 2 to 4 people. The flavors are great. You can taste each of the ingredients and they all bring something good it.  For my meal I chose the Nom Nom Burger. It comes with Kobe Beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. That list tells you everything you need to know about why I ordered it. The burger is large and filling. I was unable to finish it off. That being said, it was quite tasty. You get all the great flavors from the ingredients plus the added texture of the potato chips. The burgers also come with fries. The fries are good. They have good flavor and are the right amount of crisp.  We had to try the Bam-Boozled Shakes as well. Neither of us needed the additional food, but they sounded so good. I ordered the Red Velvet Cake Shake. It comes mixed with Zing Red Velvet Vodka, red velvet cake, cream cheese mousse and a mini whoopee pie. Yep, it was good. You get all the great flavor of red velvet with a little booze mixed in. The portion is large. It is a meal unto its self.  This is a good lunch or casual dinner spot. You could also stop in for a shake at any time. It is worth it.",

Our group also ordered the Fat Boy Adult Milkshake to share and it was definitely the BEST milkshake I've ever tasted. We got it with coconut based ice cream, and it still tasted amazing!   I ordered the Green Pastures Salad with Ahi and it was delicious! The only thing I would change about it would be the dressing, although they don't give you options for dressings. It would have been a lot more enjoyable with another kind. I tried some of my friend's burger and it was definitely a 10/10 in taste! I think it was the Rising Sun Burger.   Our waitress also gave us complimentary liquid-nitrogen meringues for dessert. Those things are so cool! I've never had anything like it. I would definitely eat here again.",

I wish I would have tried this place before going vegan but I'm glad I was able to enjoy it as a vegan too! We started with a vegan coconut raspberry milkshake and that was a treat in itself. We both ordered the urth burger sans the bun (the bun itself is not vegan), one with regular fries and one with sweet potato fries. Our food arrived very quickly, and was delicious. One of the best veggie burger patties I've ever had, I loved the red pepper and carrots inside it. It came with butter lettuce in place of the bun and a side of avocado \"spread\". We ate every single bite, it was delicious, filling and gave us enough nourishment and energy to make it to our next destination in Vegas!  Big plus to our server who pointed us in the right direction on the menu once he knew we were vegan, and to all the cute artwork all over the restaurant!",

What I love about this place is that the burgers are super juicy and have a great flavor. Earlier today I had the Gold Standard burger and it was banging! Dry aged sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, aragula, and garlic-chive aioli. Oh Em Gee!! Flavor overload! The burger was so juicy, it was dripping (I get mine medium). The sweet potato fries is the best I've had. I love that it's perfectly crispy on the outside and comes sprinkled with salt. Yum! Another favorite? The shakes! I don't always drink shakes, but when I do... I like them to have a double shot :) The drunken monkey, the campfire smores, and cookies n cream. All shakes are delicious. The cookies and cream has a huge ice-cream sandwich on top.  I don't think there is anything you can order here and go wrong. You really don't need an appetizer, a burger, fries, AND shake will stuff you. I took half my burger and fries home. But if you're greedy like me and must get a appetizer, try the buffalo dip - thick and yummy. It comes with warm tortilla chips.  The food comes out pretty quickly, and service is great. It was especially exceptional today. I wish I remembered our servers name. He was awesome!",

In other alcoholic desert drinks I have had the alcohol does not overpower the overall flavor, but this shake was very overpowering. This shake is the mint flavor and the liquor in this specific flavor did not mix well for me. I will give three stars because the shake is the only thing I had on the menu, I can't speak for the other items the restaurant has to offer. I would not come back for another shake though.",

What does this even mean? Well as a burger restaurant it falls flat on its face. To meat tasted dry and bland. Lots of bread, and for the cost really leaves you craving more.   As a dessert joint with their hard shakes, it's a real winner. The milk shakes are large and offer unique toppings. Even though they are 15.00 you feel like it's worth it. Would I ever go back? Only for a quick unique dessert. Never will I eat dinner here though.",

She was more than willing to share for my pic, but I felt weird posting something I didn't order, nor did my table.  This spot came recommended from a friend when I did a crowd sourcing for eateries in Vegas via FB (gees, this is a social media laden post)! On our way to Egg Slut a couple days prior, I noticed it and noted how close it was to our hotel.  That being said, they seriously know how to create their adult milk shakes here. They are so elaborate and look amazing! This isn't to say that their food isn't bad either, its pretty good.  To start we ordered the Poutine --french fries, cheese curds, shredded short rib, & stout gravy. The french fries were crispy and the shredded short rib was really, really good. Tender and flavorful, just lacking in quantity. The stout gravy came on the side and it wasn't my favorite, although I did use some to try it. I'm pretty sure I just wanted a more creamy gravy, this one was more like a thin liquid.  For my entree I ordered the Gold Standard -- Dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli. I asked for the tomato confit to be on the side and never even added it to the burger. Oh man, I'm glad I decided to try this place. This burger, just the patty alone, was so flavorful and ahhh-mazing! The bacon was tasty and delicious, but I really loved the bun. The aioli was good, but it didn't make or break my burger.  The burgers are pretty big. We all wished we would have shared between the three of us, in some magical way. The Parentals ordered their own, unfortunately I can't remember what they ordered. Everyone was happily devouring their burgers and had no complaints.  I wanted to order one of those fancy shakes, but didn't really like any of the flavors. However, I did order a Chocolate shake with no whip. The disappointment of how aesthetically pleasing it was in comparison the others was palpable. It tasted great, but it still left me craving the awesomeness of the others.  Our server was awesome the entire time, she was on top of everything. As was the bus boy/dude that stopped by a few times. We chose to sit in the bar area, so we could watch one of their four TVs, because the Giants were playing in the NLDS. We decided to forgo a regular table and used a coffee table instead, which meant plates on our laps for our burgers. Momma Bear was such a trooper, she sat in this setting with her back to the game so we could watch.  The atmosphere is fun, kinda quirky, and the images along one wall remind me of Warhol-esque style. The prices are what you'd expect in Vegas for alcoholic milkshakes and quality burgers. As long as you know that before hand you'll enjoy your experience.  I'm still annoyed I didn't order one of those cool shakes...",

They really have solid burgers and the portion sizes are just right so that you can enjoy their crispy onion rings and a beer and fill your stomach with happiness.  I came here with my bromance partner on a weekend trip to Vegas and this was the one lunch stop we had in the hotel.  There were other choices but when Bros get together, I don't think it goes beyond burgers and steaks and this place hit the spot.  I had the burger with mushrooms and I think he went for something with guyere cheese - mine was awesome and his looked good as well.  But I must say, their onion rings killed it!",

My mom has several food allergies to gluten and dairy and asked several questions about items on the menu and the waiter had to keep going in the back to ask the chef. I am, in a way, glad he asked the chef rather than giving out wrong information....but you should be familiar with your menu if you're going to work at a restaurant in a high-end hotel.   I had the Farm House salad which was pretty good. It had mixed greens, kale, asparagus, green beans, edamame, cauliflower, and heirloom tomatoes. It is supposed to come in a honey yogurt dressing but I got the balsamic dressing instead. I also added avocado to this and scratched the tomatoes. It was pretty tasty, all of the flavors seemed to work together. I just wasn't \"wowed\" by this salad.   We also ordered some french fries for the table which were soggy and undercooked. I like french fries to be crispy and crunchy. These were soggy and lifeless. The ketchup they serve is really good though and it seems like they make it in house.   They also have various alcoholic milkshake type beverages on their menu, which sounded amazing. One of them was a red velvet cake drink with red velvet cake vodka. There was also an almond joy and Oreo drink. Maybe I'll try one next time I'm in Vegas.",

The receptionist was friendly and the place had a fun vibe (and it has cute decor).  All was good until we found ourselves starting to death because it took forever to get our food.    Food: Tiramisu shake was rich and yummy.   Oreo shake was good too, but it didn't really have enough alcohol.  People at the table agreed that it was a waste to pay extra for an alcoholic shake.   Gold standard burger was well put together.  Meat was cooked just the way I asked for.  Sweet potato fries I paid extra 2 dollars for was far less satisfying.  It was bland.  Not crispy enough.  Blah altogether.  What a waste of $2.     Vegas has too many places to eat to return to this overpriced burger joint.",

We placed to-go orders (which you place at the bar) and the bartender who assisted us was nice and helpful.   I ended up getting the Classic with no mayo and some regular french fries. The burger was good. It was a bit dry and the amount of ketchup was a bit stingy. Lettuce and onions were plentiful and tasted fresh. Fries were good and they threw in enough ketchup packets to keep me happy.   I also ordered the Chunky Monkey adult milkshake. The Chunky Monkey is the main reason why I'd return. Awesome milkshake and I'm really considering going back today to pick up another one. Bananas, chocolate, and Reese's peanut butter cups. YASSSS.   Other than the dry burger, it was a bit pricey, but hey, it's Vegas. Go big or go home, right?",

Each are $11 a piece, which is not too bad for a sweet alcoholic beverage after a meal, or just to enjoy during your break from exploring the secret spots dotted throughout Cosmopolitan.  I came here after a sushi dinner at Blue Ribbon, and we each ordered a different \"shake\".  Collectively we ordered Black Cow, Oreo & Caramel S'mores.    As a destination for fairly reasonably priced meals, Holsteins Shakes and Buns, is recommended.  The burgers and sliders looks great, tastes good, and will not break your Vegas budget.  Atmosphere: 4/5  Cool, trendy hangout spot for locals and tourists. Decor: 4/5  Nice, trendy, modern.

I loved the salt & vinegar tasting mini bucket of popcorn they brought out for us to nibble on.  We ordered the spicy calamari to share, loved the thin fried slivers of jalepenos, definitely gave it an awesome kick.    I had the rising sun burger and thought it was delicious---I'm not a super saucy kinda gal, so maybe next time if I have it I will ask for the teriyaki to be on the side as opposed to the burger patty itself.  The tempura avocado on top of the burger was to die for.  The fries were ok, nothing to get excited over--maybe if they were sprinkled with some sort of seasoning it would have been a little better---or they could have had optional sprinkles to add on top--like garlic wasabi or parmesan--something like that--the fries were pretty plain.  Hubby had the steakhouse burger and loved it, he could barely finish it.  He said the flavors were very good.  We split a campfire s'mores booze shake and it was nothing short of glorious.  Something about marshmallow vodka that just seems so right.  I also had the house margarita as well and this had an excellent flavor too!  Overall we had a pretty good experience.  Thank goodness this place isn't nearby me or else we would have some problems--I would be drinking a different booze shake everyday.",

No thank you. When you ask for a medium burger, you definitely don't mean an overcooked chard patty or dried patties! It is a burger joint, so you would think they would learn how to cook the beef patty by now right? WRONG!  We tried the Classic, the typical cheese burger with beef patty, tomato, lettuce, and ketchup; and the Caliente, hamburger with jalapenos, avocado, jack cheese, and some cilantro mayo. The classic was so bitter because of the chard on the patty. We did not finish that burger. The Caliente's patty was slightly better, but patty was still really overcooked. It was not spicy, even though, it was called HOT in Spanish. I was not pleased. We order the black and white milkshake and the black cherry soda, which were okay.  Bill was around $60 without tip...not worth it. Go to a fast food burger joint and you'll get better burgers.",

    "text": "Located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, Holsteins has some amazing burgers. My friends and I ate here because we were gonna club at the Marquee next door and it had pink cow logo, which piqued my interest. It's a nicer burger place, so you should look presentable and not look hella grimey.  Food: 1) GOLD STANDARD - One of the best burgers I've had. Highly recommended. Aged beef sirloin with arugula, tomato, garlic-chive aioli. You can't go wrong with garlic aioli and goat cheese on a burger. I added a fried egg to it and it just made the burger so much more delicious. 2) DUCK FAT FRIES - Fried in duck fat, but doesn't taste all that different from regular fries. What made it unique was that it came with fried peppers and onions on top, which gave it a slight kick of spicy. 3) STEAK FRIES - the best steak fries I've ever had. I kept eating them even though i was stuffed. Well-seasoned and fried. I need to order more.. *drool  $11 Alcoholic Shakes: 1) FROZEN GRASSHOPPER - chocolate mint shake. It wasn't too minty and a little too sweet. Won't be ordering these overpriced shakes again. 2) OREO SHAKE - Much better. Very smooth oreo shake with alcohol. yummm. Overall the shakes were good but way too overpriced. only half shot of alcohol.  Service: 5/5 stars Server was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I find it annoying when servers don't know the menu well. We were strapped for time so he hurried everything for us, which was cool. awesome!",

It had a great teriyaki taste and was really juicy, The Kobe beef was perfectly cooked and the patty was a thick 1/2 lb.  Now I know why it's voted best on the strip.  $18 for burger with fries and  $13 shakes (also awesome) so definitely a bit on the expensive side (and I'm from NYC)  For the best burger under $10, go across the street to Fuku Burger",

    "text": "Great place for burgers! Was recommended this place by a friend who compared the quality of the burgers to Father's Office in LA. I haven't tried that place yet but this is definitely a solid joint.   This place is pretty popular so expect a wait. We were seated after about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. You can leave your number with them and they'll call you when your table is ready.  The popcorn to start with is really good..honestly they were better than the fries that came with the burger. The fries were kind of bad, reminded me of cafeteria fries and were greasy and soggy, hence taking off one star. The burgers however were well worth the price, huge and delicious. I ordered a steakhouse and, being a gal who sprinkles tons of pepper on everything, enjoyed it very much, however it was definitely more cooked than the medium rare I had asked for. One of my friends got the rising sun which I think I'll try next time, I've never had any burger like it. Another friend got the machete and he said it was the first burger in his life that he couldn't finish, so that gives you an idea about the enormous portion sizes. ;)  Decor is nice, service was pretty slow but overall it was a good experience and I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas. :)",

    "text": "Stayed at the Cosmopolitan with my wife a while ago. Decided to try out Holstein's for dinner; my coworker only had good things to say about it.  The staff greeted us as soon as we walked into the establishment. We got a booth right away, probably because we went before the dinner rush.  Both my wife and I ordered a hamburger and a shake. The burger was heavenly; the bun toasted just right, the meat melted in my mouth. Easily the best hamburger I have ever eaten. I just got a vanilla shake (without alcohol), but it was still one of the most delicious shakes I've had.  For a burger and a shake, it's a little more pricey than I would normally do, but for the quality, I think it's definitely a fair price. Can't wait to go back again!",

After browsing the menu, I decided to go with the The Longhorn (Burger, Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Cole Slaw, Pickle), $16. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q#l0ExJUbDA_O0mX8qkPR_2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg#GccYBoYbiRiDZTNsbEyRtg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  I took one bite of the Burger and fell in love with it.  The combination of Beef Brisket with the Burger was awesome.  The BBQ Sauce gave it a tangy flavor while the Slaw softened it up with a sweet, creamy flavor.....yum!  One thing though about this restaurant....the floor is really slippery.  Wifey almost fell walking in heels because it was so slippery.  While we were dining, we saw a few more people slip as well.  The floor wasn't wet or anything like that, I think it just gets slippery when it's clean....probably over-polished.  Despite that danger, we'll be back.  Return Factor - 95%",

Simple concept of adding an egg to a burger, we've seen it before but Holstein's does it right. Expect to make a mess with this one.  The Steakhouse Burger with a peppered patty, steak sauce - and other perfectly combined ingredients - was mind-blowing too.  I couldn't make a decision to which burger was best. Each time I had one bite of one and then the other, I said \"this one is best!\".  They were both that good. And the fries were equally as good - some crispy, some soft - great flavor. The boyfriend and I agree this place is on our list of Top 5 burgers (probably Top 3 for me!).    Captain Crunch Shake with vodka ... if you like Captain Crunch you'll love this! I wanted to try it based on the waitress's recommendation. No regrets, but I'll go with something that has chocolate in it next time - and there WILL be a next time.  Alcoholic beverages are stiff, service was quick (but also, I went pretty late), and the waitress was down to earth.",

    "text": "Anything that has the words Shake and Buns in it, immediately gets my attention. It's always a plus if one can shake their buns.  This used to be my go-to burger place in town before BurGR. I really like the ambiance in this place as it's usually full and loud. My kind of place. I guess trendy environments appeal to me.  I am a creature of habit when it comes to food. Although I consider myself a foodie, I stick to what I like and hardly ever try anything else. When at Holsteins I always order their California Turkey Burger (sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepperjack cheese, Russian dressing) with a side of fries. At first I wasn't too sure about the Russian dressing, but I really liked how all the flavors came together once biting into it. I usually find places making my Turkey Burgers too dry, however, that wasn't the case here. It was cooked to perfection and very juicy even though I requested well-done. The only negative I find in their burgers is that they are messy. I personally prefer my food stay together and not having to finish my burgers with a fork. That would be the only reason I dropped them one-star. My wife usually gets their Fun-Ghi Burger (beef patty topped w/ forest mushrooms, caramelized onion, gruyere cheese, frissee, & truffle mayo). She's more adventurous than I am, but this is by far her favorite.  Although I think it's weird, I like that they serve you complimentary seasoned popcorn. I think they do this to make you thirsty so that you can order one of their many Shake selections. Regardless, the popcorn tastes very good and is a nice touch nonetheless.  You MUST also try their Liquid Nitrogen Desserts. This item isn't on the menu, but it is a rather neat experience if you've never tried it. We get this every time because it feels funny in your mouth. You know what doesn't feel funny in your mouth? Well, that's for you to figure out. Seriously though, I don't know how exactly to describe it other than a lot of smoke comes out of your mouth and nose and it's very, very cold.  All-in-all, it was a good place to go for some good burgers and a fun environment. Service is hit-or-miss, but the food makes up for that. I will be here again very soon when I crave a good Turkey Burger.",

    "text": "Well, just a few days ago I learned that Holsteins prepares a damn fine burger--and a superior Chocolate Shake!  After being escorted to a comfortable corner booth, we began with complimentary freshly popped Popcorn.  It was unnecessary but good.    Next came juicy Fried Pickles with a really good Caper Mayo Dressing.  A hot and crisp outer shell encased a scorching hot but very tasty pickle interior that truly satisfied after the breaded spears were dipped in the mellow mayo.  Meanwhile, I had a hard time deciding whether I preferred the delicious Chocolate Milk Shake with Chocolate Syrup or the thick and sweet Whipped Cream that took up one-fourth of the drink's height.  I even lamented to Diane that it was too bad that there wasn't more liquid in the shake until she reminded me that the silver canister set down on the table with the shake contained still more chocolatey fluid (about a quarter of a tall glassful).  And, so it did!      Then the burgers and fries arrived.  For me, a Classic with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, onions, and ketchup was medium rare as ordered, and happily contained no visible char.  There was an excellent grilled taste to the meat, and although the plain bun and solid sheet of green lettuce were not my favorites, there was no question that this was a top-tier burger, and I had no problem finishing off the ample half-pounder, along with the tasty Shoestring Fries that accompanied it.  Meanwhile, Diane clearly enjoyed her medium-rare Nom Nom Burger with Kobe Beef and Cheddar Cheese, as well as fulfilling Fat Fries.  Our server was slow in executing what he promised, but was busy with a mostly full house and eventually came through with water refills, extra ketchup, and a salt shaker as hard driving music enveloped the cow-adorned dining room.   It was a nice, filling, and satisfying dinner, which I expect to repeat despite the next day's uptick on the home scale.",

The shakes (with or without alcohol) were tempting but most of us were lactose intolerant and we still had a long day ahead of us so we decided to skip it.  Golden Standard:  You had me at bacon, goat cheese and garlic chive aioli.  The tomato confit cuts the richness of the angus beef patty and the arugula adds \"pepperyness\" to the burger. 4/5  Rising Sun: Teriyaki burger with Kobe beef, tempura avocado, nori furikake, fried yams and spicy mayo. 4/5  Steakhouse Burger: Beef burger with steak sauce, onion marmalade, mushrooms, Swiss cheese and tomato confit. I wasn't too thrilled with this one. 3/5  Donut Slider: Very creative presentation.  A sweet burger-looking dessert.  The \"bun\" is a brioche doughnut.  The \"patty\" is made of chocolate ganache toppe with crispy coconut, strawberry and passionfruit.  It also comes with a side of \"fries\" made of crisp pound cake and a berry \"ketchup\" for dipping. It tasted as good as it looked 5/5  Service was great.  The interior is very playful and funky. Artwork were very cartoon-y.  I recommend making a reservation as this place fills up pretty quickly.",

I'd recommend trying the Rising Sun because who can resist kobe beef, crispy yam, and avocado tempura all in one burger amongst some other stuff??? The crunchy texture just adds a whole new dimension to the burger. I eat a good amount of food and the burgers here are pretty filling. You also HAVE to try one of their milkshakes, whether it be a plain non-alcoholic one or the cool looking adult ones with alcohol haha. I have only tried the strawberry milkshake and it was so good and creamy without feeling too excessive. I usually don't like getting milkshakes, but this is one of the FEW places I am willing to get them. I will definitely go here the next time I am craving a burger on the strip and will probably try another milkshake. Check this place out!",

Apparently where he's from, you have to drive miles and miles to get a decent \"gourmet\" meal.  The wait wasn't so bad either on a busy Saturday night during the dinner rush hour. We put our names down on the wait list and gave them one of our cell phone numbers.The wait was only 15-20 minutes and we were seated inside the dining area instead of the bar (which is good cuz apparently by 9:30pm, there's a DJ booth set up in the bar area and we prefer to have good convos during dinner and not have to yell or scream at each other).  Since I had a burger in Vegas the previous 2 nights I opted to order something else off the menu while the boys both ordered themselves some burgers. I got the Surf & Turf Quesadilla. We also ordered onion rings to start and they sure were bomb diggity. Very crispy with huge ass oninos and I could bite through each one easily. Which is a major bonus for me since I have a horrible underbite. When my quesadilla came out, I dove right in and noticed how amazingly soft and flavorful the tortilla was. The quesadilla comes with Broiled Steak and Maine Lobster stuffed with Manchego Cheese and the avocado cream on top was seriously like the best creamy jizz shot you've ever tasted. ;)  For dessert we got The Candy Store which came with 5 cute little cake-pop like delectables. They're a bit pricey, but you're in Vegas and since we don't drink I didn't mind gettin a nice sugar high for a hefty price.  We also got the homemade blueberry pop tart with red velvet popcorn and sweet corn ice cream that sat on top of the most decadent lemon tart reduction. OMG! Amazeballs!  I definitely wanna come back here and have a burger next time and maybe even one of their crazy milkshakes if I decide to start drinking alcohol again.",

They also added mushrooms and other things. The flavors didn't work nearly as well. Such a letdown.",

It's like the Shake Shack or Good Stuff Eatery on the East Coast.   Instead of bread, there was a medium sized pail of mixed popcorn - BBQ cheddar and regular. It was a bit too early for an alcoholic beverage so I got a Strawberry Malt (which consisted of strawberry ice cream and milk mixed together and topped with whipped cream and strawberry meringue. For starters, we shared a Caesar salad (which consisted of purple and green romaine lettuce, croutons, and shaved grana padano cheese tossed in a garlic-parmesan dressing. It was topped with two, small, thinly sliced bread with melted cheese. For entrees, we ordered the following burgers: Captain Hook and California Turkey. They allow customers to substitute the regular fries for sweet potato fries or onion rings for an additional $2. The sweet potato fries were served in a small pail. The Captain Hook burger consisted of pan seared salmon cooked to medium and glazed with remoulade sauce, smoked salmon, fricassee, and red colored pickled shallots. The California Turkey consisted of turkey party with parsley and spices, sprouts, tomato, avocado, cucumber, thinly shredded coleslaw, pepper jack cheese, and Russian dressing.",

It's a cute modern restaurant with a nice bar area in front. The menu is not overwhelming but have a lot of choose from. Drinks, shakes, burgers, appetizers and salads. The burgers were around $18.50, comes with fries. I got the steakhouse peppered burger and my bf got the al pastor burger. We asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection! Juicy and so much flavor! Burgers were a nice size too! Bread was also yummy and fresh. We both agreed that the burgers were one of the best burgers we have ever had! Fries were airy and crispy, not greasy. Staffs friendly and refilled our water consistently. Def appreciated that , especially with the hot vegas weather ! We will def be back to try other burgers. Recommend for everyone looking for a delicious burger !",

    "text": "When in Vegas....  There are so many places to get a good burger, but a great burger AND a shake?! Yeah, Holsteins Shakes & Buns at the Cosmopolitan is the spot. Located on the second floor right off the escalators, look for the cutest cows. The decor at Holsteins is really eye-catching and cute. According to one of the servers, they just changed the artwork last week. (Check some out, I took photos.) There's a bar in the front and the restaurant is located towards the back.   Right after you are seated, you are treated to delish popcorn with cajun seasoning. Seriously, nom nom nom....I could've eaten it all and then some. But, I knew I had to save room for my shake and burger. Hubby and I decided to share a shake and a burger since we didn't want to be stuck with leftovers. That was a good choice because for $9, you get a quality size shake and the extras (that don't fit in the cup). We ordered a vanilla shake that just might have been the most delish shake I've ever had. It was topped with a lot of whipped cream and these tiny pearl balls that were so yummy. We decided on the FUN-ghi burger ($17) which is a beef patty topped with forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, frisee, and truffle mayo. Every burger comes with fries and they were yummy! The burger was juicy, messy, and flavorful - but not sure it was worth the $17. (I figured it was hotel food so, hence, the jacked up price.)  Overall, service, atmosphere, and the food were awesome. I would give this place 4 and a half stars, but rounded it up for Yelp purposes. (Gotta take into consideration that it's a food place in a fancy hotel and on the Strip, so you know you are gonna have to pay a premium for food.) In any case, if you've already checked out Wicked Spoon and Secret Pizza at the Cosmo, Holsteins is your next best choice. More popcorn, please!",

I wasn't terribly hungry, so I ordered the sliders, and at 13.00, I got three small burgers, topped with Brioche buns and pickles, mustard and grilled onions. Each about the size of a silver dollar. My friend, a school teacher, ordered the salad with Salmon. She said her food was done perfectly, and we got a side of sweet potato fries.   Everything was great, except the -already drunk- douchebros behind us who were SO very loud and so VERY annoying that it made it hard for us to enjoy the rest of our meal.

This stuff is like crack. Down: Waiter comes to table. He's looking a bit distracted \"Hi I'm ---. I'll be back in a second\" - disappears for a few. Up: Waiter comes back. Gets our orders. We get water. Yay! Up: Our milkshake comes out with a GIANT ice cream cookie on top. The milkshake is delicious although I wish the cookie was warmer/softer. Up: Our food comes out! Look at those beautiful burgers! Down: Where our the onion rings that we got instead of fries? Down: Poutine - overrated. Not enough curds. Skip the extra egg. Up: Our friend's burger was cooked perfectly medium - pink in the middle and according to her, very juicy. Down: Our burger, also ordered medium, was cooked to well down with zero signs of pink. Since we were on a time crunch to catch a show, we didn't want to bother trying to find our waiter and send this puppy back. But it was dry dry dry. The saving grace was that we added an egg which helped to moisten the patty. Down: Bill comes out and the beer is a different price than what was on the menu. Not the waiter's fault since some of the 'old' menus with the 'old' prices were mixed in with the 'new' menus. Minor quibble but at this point, we were a tad annoyed with all the mix ups.  Not coming back here again for a per person bill of around $35 (inclusive of tax and tip).",

As for the banana cream pie shake, I usually don't like shakes but this one was a guilty pleasure ! However, I must say it would be too much for one so  I recommend to share with another person and sorry to be a bearer of bad news but  kids you can't have any because it is spiked with alcohol!  Service: Our server was always attentive and came back a couple of times to refill our water so no complaints!  But shame on him for offering us the shake and dessert menu! I probably gained 1377384893 pounds, but that shake was oh so worth it!  Final Verdict: One of the best burger places I have EVER tried!",

So much flavor in every bite, it was so enjoyable. I'm also a fan of their crispy cooked French fries as well.  I got the A-chocolypse shake to finish off the meal, and that was one of the best calls I made all weekend. So much chocolatey goodness.   We sat at the bar which was comfortable, and the waitress was very friendly. Props to them with some of the obnoxious attitudes they have to put up with from some people.  Don't forget to check in on Yelp and get a free drink with your meal. Good deal!",

Items we had for appetizers:  -Buffalo chicken dip (Spicier than normal) -Onion rings (a must!) -philly cheese steak egg rolls (HEAVENLY) -buff wings (super super spicy).  Meal: Nom nom burger with fries (I am a sucker for potato chips so this was amazing).  Shake: Cereal Bowl 2.0. It literally tasted like the milk from a cereal bowl - with a little hint of vodka. Aka what dreams are made of.   We had a large group (21) but everything was still very timely and the servers were friendly and informative.   I ate way too much, but it was well worth it.  Also - shout out to drinks to go! A must for anyone in Vegas.",

I ordered a rising sun burger which supposedly has kobe beef which is misleading. In America, wagyu is the equivalent of kobe. Despite that, the burger itself was quite good and larger than other gourmet burgers.   Service was also commendable. Our server was generous and accommodating but may have to work on her jokes.",

Living in LA and experiencing real gastropub burger joints on a regular basis has killed my awe for a burger beer bar. In Vegas, you should kill it.   Beer list must have been put together by someone closing their eyes and pointing at what their distributor could supply them with. Get some good beer! Not crap I can buy at the grocery store. Next, don't charge 8 to 9 a pint for it. You're making money on your 16.50 mac and cheese that's the size of my wallet. It was so good but for god's sake, give me a real serving. The 17.50 burger was good, cooked to a perfect medium rare. But again, I've had Kobe beef burgers, and it's not that expensive. Oh, it's your aged cheese that drives up the price. Give me some unaged stuff, drop the price, and i'll come back. The fries were a soggy, soaked in oil train wreck. How do you mess that up???

    "text": "Ironically enough, I've raved endlessly about how awesome the Cosmo is and yet I didn't even come here for the first time until earlier this year.  Then my friend said, you know, you should really go to Holsteins and try their Asian burger because it's friggin awesome.  Well, I just happened to be in the Cosmo without having eaten a meal all day.  And I love burgers, so why the hell not?  Three trips later, this spot has reached rare territory for me: mandatory trip every time I go to Vegas (which seems to happen at least once a month, so this is going to be a very fruitful partnership!).  On an overall basis, top 10 burgers lifetime.  Generally, the flavors of each burger and balanced very well.  Nothing is overpowering the meat, which is of excellent quality.  The ingredients they use are fresh.  As for the burgers themselves?  The aforementioned Asian burger, aka the Rising Sun, was definitely something quite unique.  Crispy yam, a massive tempura-fried avocado, and kobe beef?  I just want to eat it again, but I feel like I need to try all the other burgers on the menu too.  Well, that would have to be the Billionaire Burger.  And pretty much, you had me at foie gras on a burger.  Last burger I've had was the Steakhouse Burger.  While not on the same level as the previous two, I was not disappointed whatsoever.  Just look at the dripping cheese on that picture I posted on it, how can you not fall in love with it?  Other items...where else can I get country fried bacon?  Deep fried bacon?  Seriously, stop tempting my heart!  The fries are ok, certainly get the job done.  Onion rings are fried perfectly, it's worth it to get them as as sub.  Even for the standard Vegas premium for pricing, it's not obscenely outrageous.  In fact, it's almost impossible to find anything on the Strip that is even remotely good value for money.  Simply put, Holsteins is awesome food in an awesome hotel.  And it is perfectly placed...came here once after raging all day at Marquee Dayclub.  Could not have been a better post-partying meal, ever!",

Overall, it was a great experience. The manager walked around checking tables, and the atmosphere was really fun and upbeat. If I had one complaint, it would be that my burger kind of fell apart when I tried to eat it making it very messy... But burgers are meant to be messy, so I can't really complain about that.",

I got an Al Pastor burger and it was beyond salty. Chugging my water didn't help. Ya girl was thirsty. I had to buy a bottle of Gatorade to help quench the thirst.

    "text": "Made sure to stop by this place as it has become a tradition with one of my close friends to grab burgers and shakes here after dayclubbing at Marquee. After a long hiatus from Vegas, it definitely feels good to finally grab a bite at this place with some good food and company.  For my most recent visit, I came with a party of 8 on a Saturday at 2pm and we were all seated right away. It was clear that we all just got out of the pool and were semi-dry so it was nice that they were willing to seat us (but I still recommend to clean up as much as you can for any business!). The place is more on the casual side but does have some hints of elegance (because it's Vegas!). There's bright color cartoon pictures and paintings along the walls, making this place lots of fun to look at. Once you're seated, you are greeted with a small tin of popcorn, which is jam-packed with flavor from all the spices and herbs they use.  I usually get their beef burgers (super delicious and juicy btw!) but this time wanted to try something different. This time I decided to split their Crazy Bird burger (Chicken) and Urth burger (Vegan) with a friend. The Crazy Bird had a decent amount of chicken to it but did lack a little bit of seasoning for my liking. The Urth burger, on the other hand, had an intriguing flavor to it and the consistently of the patty had a great mushy consistency to it (don't know how else to describe it but if you're Vegan, you will definitely enjoy this burger!). Also warning: fries that come with the burgers are super addicting and made fresh.   It's also a must to try one of the \"Bam-Boozled\" milkshake at this place! They're known for their strategic use of booze (it really sneaks up on you hint hint) but you can also get any milkshake alcohol-free. Their milkshakes are pretty top-notch and I've tried most of them with and without the booze. One thing that impressed me during this visit was how they elevated the look of their milkshakes with all the sweet decorations but it's definitely more for pics than it is for taste. Their milkshakes are pretty big and can feel heavy with your meal so highly recommend sharing all the sweetness with someone.  I usually spend around $25-$30 including for a burger and milkshake depending on whether if I decide to sub for Sweet Potato fries and which burger I order. Will be looking forward to coming back to this place during my next Vegas trip.",

While we looked over the menu our waiter brought out some complimentary flavored popcorn which we were careful not to eat too much of knowing how much food we'd be ordering.   My husband ordered the Rising Sun burger and I got the Fun-ghi burger. Mine was a high quality mushroom-swiss equivalent with gruyere instead of swiss and a truffle mayo. I enjoyed it and would recommend. The fries were quite tasty and I couldn't stop eating them even after I was full.   We shared a Cookies and Cream \"bamboozled shake\" which we were able to get without alcohol because I was pregnant. They have a system where a pink straw means no alcohol and a blue straw means alcohol so there are no mix ups :) The shake came with the extra in a silver mixer as well as an entire ice cream sandwich. We could have used a third person to share it with us! I recommend sharing between two people at least.   I'd come back to try various other shakes and burgers. The prices are steep but in line with Vegas pricing in general and based on the service and quality of food I feel like pricing was fair.",

We walked up at 6:30 PM on a Friday without reservations and were seated immediately. I got the Nom Nom burger and my husband got the Gold Burger which was voted best in Vegas. We shared the Campfire Smore Shake because its huge and you get the shaker with left over shake along with it. I kinda wished they weren't soooo big so we could try two different flavors but that's kinda the whole point of them so it's fine. We agreed my husband's burger was the best. My burger tasted great, no question, but the potato chips were a bit hard and made it difficult to bite into. I also wish they had been a little more generous with the 1000 Island Dressing. This place doesn't beat Gordan Ramsey's Burger for us in the burger department but it's a close second. The shakes put it over the top and we'd definitely come again.",

Here at Holsteins you will find the finest spiked milkshake In Vegas.  You will find a line-up of shakes spiked or non-spiked (spiked as in with alcohol). Whichever you milkshake you may choose these are a meal in themselves.  Come thirsty & come hungry. Why? Riddle me this, how can one not order a shake AND one of the burgers...along with a side.  burgers are always consistently cooked just as I ordered. Not undercooked, nor over cooked.  No frozen hamburger buns here, no frozen fries here!  Vegans, they do have a 'burger' patty for you, with black beans and a variety of veggies:) Go ahead. Do it. Just do it.  Regret it later when you feel the need for a nap. Food coma anyone? ;)",

The gold standard burger I had was good and really fresh and the waiter was super nice but only giving 3 stars because I couldn't experience what I really wanted to try the most. My bf got the vegan milkshake and liked it but it wasn't my type of shake. It was pretty though.",

Instead of donating my cash to the casino, it was best to get a burger and a milkshake in return now.   We were given the choice of sitting in the lounge or dining room. We elected for the lounge. It was casual and the hockey game was on. So we got seated immediately and ask for our servers best recommendations on the shakes and burgers.   Surprisingly, I signed up for some membership thing for this place, and when my birthday passed earlier this month I got a coupon for a free shake! An alcoholic one might I add! So I ordered up a cookies & cream shake. Very tasty, but not enough alcohol. Lol. It was toped with an ice cream sandwich too. If I would have known, I would have waited till after the burger to get this. This was more of a dessert! I only drank half if it, and took the other half to the hotel.   Now, there's The Rising Sun burger. This was a fantastic burger! The meat was very flavorful. Each bite had a blissful variety of texture and flavor. From the teriyake glaze to the crunchy yam to the tempura avocado! Imagine that! It's hard to, so I highly recommend this burger with some great Asian flavors! I also upgraded to the sweet potatoe fries. All this for a little over $20. Remember, I got the shake for free for my bday!!! Woot woot! Sign up for it!!!  Wish our server passed by a little more regularly. It took awhile till my water glass was refilled. And I wish she would have recommended the shake for dessert instead. When I received my check, she hadn't deducted the shake. But I gave her a friendly reminder and it was removed. Thank you for a yummy dinner. Would definitely wanna come back here again!",

He was very attentive and made suggestions when we asked for assistance. We ordered 2 kids meals. One was chicken fingers and fries and the second order was mac n cheese. We ordered the cookies and cream and fat boy shakes. All the money worth! So make sure to order one. We ordered the Nom Nom and the Gold Standard Burger.  Our shakes arrived and our eyes grew bigger and bigger. I was afraid they would be too sweet but were on point with the sweetness level. We enjoyed them while waiting for the burgers which arrived after about 15-20 minute wait. We enjoyed the flavors of the burgers accompanied by the buttermilk onion rings.  Christian was staying on top of the hospitality on the table. He was very personable and attentive.  I went with my daughter to the restroom which was overflooding with paper towels and had not been cleaned in a while. I notified the host which was stationed halfway of the restaurant who addressed my concern as soon as my daughter left the restroom.   I witnessed two restaurant managers as they were dressed in suits. Neither checked in with us but one processed our credit card at the end of the dinner.",

The hostesses are nice but not overly caring or friendly. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation.  To start, our server and food runner were excellent.  Chaz made recommendations on which milk shakes and drinks we should order, so we tried them.    The food came out fast and was cooked as we asked.  The only thing which was my fault, I ordered my son's hamburger well done, which dried it out a little too much, so stick to lesser temperatures.  The deep fried cauliflower and lamb meatballs were very good.  My oldest is a spaghetti sauce and meatball snob, and these got his seal of approval.  The service and food were so good that we went back our second night just for shakes.  Again great service and the same frowning faces at the front.  Overall, great place full of energy and fun.",

We went for dinner mid week and it wasn't too busy, we were seated in less than 10 minutes. The service was also very quick.   Their burgers range in prices from $13-18, though if you're feeling fancy, you can order the Billionaire Burger for $32. I opted for the Nom Nom Burger, which includes a Kobe beef patty topped with cheddar cheese, potato chips and 1000 island dressing. It is quite possibly the best burger I've had in my life thus far - and now I'm wondering if the Billionaire Burger is the next step up.   Their shakes are $15 and can easily be shared with 2-3 people. My friend and I split the A-Chocolypse Now shake, which consisted of pinnacle chocolate vodka, chocolate sauce, Oreo cookies, and various milk chocolate bar pieces in addition to some chocolate pocky sticks. At the top was a fudge brownie. It's quite decadent, which is why I would recommend sharing if possible.   I will definitely be back as there are so many other shakes I want to try.",

As a vegetarian (I eat some fish) I had studied the menu ahead of time to make sure there was enough food for me to eat. I was beyond excited to try the birthday shake and was not disappointed one bit, it was the perfect shake/cake combo! WOW! My friends tried the peppermint and chocolate banana shakes also and they were all fantastic. I'm not sure there is much booze actually in them but I really wanted it more for the shake factor!  We ordered some appetizers, I had both the lobster truffle mac and cheese and the calamari, both were excellent. The mac and cheese was amazing, I could have easily ordered that for dinner and been satisfied.   After the appetizers I should have called it quits (I was full enough and extremely satisfied) but I decided to order the vegan burger and shoestring fries, the vegan burger was good, piles of avocado on top which I love but the patty wasn't anything special. I've had better vegan patties.....the avocado though was AWESOME. The fries were cooked perfectly also.   My boyfriend and mom both had the surf n turf sliders, I did not try these but both of them said they are well worth the price tag.....  Overall the prices were decent for Vegas, not too expensive and definitely enough food to fill us up for dinner. I definitely recommend the restaurant!!",

You can get some gambling at the casino downstairs, just remember to not lose your life savings.   The Rising Sun burger with the Kobe beef is tremendous. It is juicy and flavorful. My only knock on it is I wish it had something sweet to go along with it like a tomato. The avocado adds a nice touch to it though.  The fries were good but nothing exceptional. Definitely come here for the burgers. I didn't get a shake but I assume it's good if it's in the name.   Would definitely come back if in Vegas.   P.S. Add a fried egg. Makes everything better.",

They have your average flavors to chose from, but they also have many adult, cocktail inspired milkshakes. What makes a mint chocolate chip milkshake stand out? Add some peppermint schnapps!   I had a regular burger, and it was tasty as well. The decor was a nice and open area and the service was what you would expect. I would recommend this place for a nice, quick friend putting anytime!",

    "text": "Shakes and Buns?! I'm sold!  I knew I wanted to try a 'crazy' shake when I saw the online menu before we go to this place, but they didn't seem to have as many shakes as I saw online or my failed memory from constant drinking and partying the many nights before was kicking in or I was just starting to feel 26. Who knows?  We opted to sit in the lounge area (only 2 of us since the rest of our party decided to fly out of Vegas early, good if you don't want to gamble all your winnings away last minute) and we were greeted by our waitress.  I ordered from the Tiny Buns (also known as sliders) and got the Crispy Pork Sliders! I was also suffering from what we believed to be a food allergy to something from the night before, so we informed our waitress that I have a seafood allergy and she went ahead and informed the kitchen of this so they would take extra care as to not contaminate ANYTHING with seafood. Man do I miss seafood... +50 stars for this alone.  The pork sliders were small, but filling...may be small for other people though! They pan fried them for me to be extra safe.  My dining partner, Jeff L., ordered some fat ass burger called The Rising Sun. I didn't get to taste it, but it looked REALLY good. Also, it comes with fries, but not enough fries where it you could split it amongst people.  I didn't want to overeat, even though we were in Sin City, so I just got a shake as oppose to the pretty awesome sounding appetizers. We shared the Cereal Bowl shake which basically had Captain Crunch in it. It won't cut the roof of your mouth!  Downside: we didn't get any utensils or condiments and/or free popcorn and couldn't flag down our waitress for it either! Whomp whomp had to ask the bartender!",

When we were there, Foursquare had a deal that gives you a glass of house beer when you check in. It's just like Bud Light, but who can't resist free beer!?   I got string fries with my burger and they were delish as well. Bf got onion rings and they were very crispy.   I'm salivating just thinking about the burgers.....X-D  Oh, while we were waiting for a table, we got a couple of cocktails-- I got a blood orange cosmopolitan (since we were at the Cosmopolitan, thought that was fitting) and Bf got an old fashioned.

All are great...make sure you add a fried egg and mushrooms.  Careful with the Shakes however, very filling if you get a shake and a burger.

    "text": "It's expensive, and in my opinion, not really worth the money.  We got the lobster mac 'n cheese, alcoholic tiramisu shake, funghi, and rising sun burger.   The lobster mac 'n cheese was good, with nice chunks of lobster and a creamy but still liquid pasta sauce (and campanelle pasta! nice touch), but there was just so little of it. It came in the same small, shallow cast iron dish that their dips came in (as we saw at the other table), and for a price of $17, too steep for my mac 'n cheese wallet.  The alcoholic tiramisu shake was not very noticeably alcoholic. And the shakes themselves are pretty much the same price as their burgers, but we just figured go big or go home. It was pretty delicious and a bit too sweet when it melted and tasted like liquefied tiramisu, which was the closest thing to refreshing when I got sick of all the savory orders.  The funghi was moderately disappointing, the not-disappointed side mainly because I was hungry.. It consisted of a beef patty, roasted portabello mushroom, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere cheese, frisee as vegetation, and aioli...what type, I'm not completely sure. It was $16.50, pretty large and beefy, with a meaty portabello...but still, a bit bland for my palate...there wasn't much sha-zam in the burger, mushroom afficionado or not.  The rising sun burger was supposed to be the showstopper...the idea of it sounds absolutely ingenious, and I was initially very excited for it. Built of a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado, it sounds like someone took a delicious burger and prepared it with a Japanese pantry. And the individual points were all present with the burger, but I felt like the burger was overwhelming my salty and sweet taste buds. The teriyaki glaze was way too much, either too sweet and salty or too much sheer quantity for the burger. The nori furikake was actually kind of salty too, which disillusioned me from furikake for a while...the tempura avocado was soggy and the batter, too thick and not crispy. Which I guess happens when you deep fry and avocado and then stuff it between a huge slab of ground beef and a tower of toppings. After finishing it I felt the need to chug my glass of water...so the burger cost me $17 and an extra trip to the bathroom.  In foresight of these issues, we ordered two sides of raw onion...very nicely, thinly sliced, in a way that let it melt in your mouth so that you only tasted the sweetness of the onion, but yet it was a full indisputable bite of onion. Delectable. Those onions were a side dish to everything that night, they just seemed to make everything better.  Holstein's is alright, you know? It really has some great concepts with the creative gourmet burgers and alcoholic milk shakes, but a little better execution would be valued. I'd give it a 2.5 - 2.7 stars if I could, mostly due to the steep prices for what was a semi-disappointing meal.",

We were not starving, so we opted to share a burger, appetizer and milkshake.  If you're really hungry, you'll be able to finish a burger and shake with no problem.  They brought out a snack of salt and vinegar popcorn to everyone's table and this stuff is awesome. You'll be asking for another bucket of it.  We had the Drunken Monkey milkshake and it was everything you want an alcoholic milkshake to be.  I would imagine that all the different flavors would be as well.    We ordered the buffalo chicken wing dip as an appetizer.  I've made this stuff at home and loved it, but wasn't thrilled with their take on it.  It was more like a creamy ranch hot sauce mixture, and you couldn't really find the chicken.  It tasted ok, but it isn't something I'd order again.   The burger was one of the best I've had.  It was the Steakhouse burger and we ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The flavors popped out all over the place.  If this review were based on the burger alone, I would have given it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, while tasty, the skinny fries were cold.    If you're on your way to the Wicked Spoon, save $20 and stop here instead.",

A while back, I had seen some show on some basic-cable channel and it showed that Vegas has a gazillion burger options, all apparently awesome. Holstein's had stuck in my brain, and so it was on my list.   Lo and behold, I'm headed to Vegas, and Holstein's is in my hotel! After encouraging my friends to check it out (didn't take much encouragement though, honestly), we made reservations for dinner. And, it was an all-around hit!  I had a Campfire Smores Bam-Boozled shake, with a Nom Nom burger & fries.  Shake was GREAT! Really, not that boozy. But I loved the chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker combo.  And the Nom Nom burger was awesome. I am not a fan of the whole \"nom nom nom\" thing, but LOVED the burger despite the name. Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, chips, and 1000 island. Great combo!! Burger was cooked to my order, and the bun stood up to the burger well, without getting soggy. All my friends loved *their* burgers too.   While we waited for our food, our server brought us \"pizza popcorn\" which was an ENORMOUS hit.   Service was very friendly and efficient.     Definitely worth a stop in if you're hunting for a great burger in Vegas! Reservations recommended for fastest seating.",

I wasn't sure if I was into having an 8oz burger (ie the big bun) so I decided to go for the tiny buns (3 sliders per serve).  2nd mistake - I ordered something other than a beef patty (pretty obvious this is a beef place).  I ordered the Ahi sliders.  So yes maybe other choices would have been better.  But for a place with burgers as main attraction as a burger?  The slider buns were very disappointing - cold and hard.  The Ahi had a spicy herb crust on the outside and tasted decent (nothing to rave about), the cucumber and slaw under the quartered piece of Ahi were actually in my opinion the highlight.  In fact I would have paid for that to be an Ahi cucumber salad much more happily.  Sweet potato fries I added were decent - but again not really memorable.  The redeeming thing?  The margarita I ordered was very nice.",

Restaurant is beautiful and comfortable, service is exceptionally friendly and efficient. But to pay that much for burgers I expect something more memorable. My funghi burger was a bit salty and the truffle oil really overpowered the burger. The burger was huge, so it seems the focus is more on the quantity than quality.  The shake was delicious, lighter and not as rich as other shakes. I would give this place a miss and check out other offerings.",

I had the Rising Sun which is probably the most unique burger on the menu with tempura fried avocado slices, a \"teriyaki\" which was more of a Korean bulgogi type of sauce, crispy onions and a fried egg which I added manually.  Great burger, but nothing that blew my pants off.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was on top of things.  She was very attentive and always had my drink refilled.  This was an off hour however and I was like one of maybe 15 people in the restaurant.  I still prefer Burger Bar to all of the other burger joints on the strip.",

I am Not saying Holsteins is a bad burger as it was OK and Good but for a high priced burger I was expecting the beef  patty a full fat one to taste better with more flavor and juice than when I cook a 93% lean burger at home.  I got the Fungi Burger. I was expecting more mushrooms than onions but it was mostly onions that were very good I add. I upgraded the aged sirloin beef to wagu style since I buy this meat once in a while and it's very good. My burger was juicy enough but did lack flavor. I was expecting it to taste really good and beefy. I liked the study well sized bun but my sweet potato fried seemed old.  My husband had a dry aged sirloin burger with bacon , goat cheddar cheese and arugula. He had to send back his bun because it was hard as a rock. We laughed about it with the waiter and got a new one fast. His medium rare burger was lacking in taste and was oddly juiceless. He complained to me and said it's not as tasty or juicy as your 93% lean burgers you make at home.  That's how it was  expensive and we had better.  But I note service was excellent.",

First off we got the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. Which sound DELICIOUS!!! BUT!  It wasn 15 bucks for 3 rolls with barely any cheesteak inside. It was hard to find any meat. And it was just super fried and bleh. No thanks.   5/10  Next up was the booze shakes!! This was a very clever idea! I like it a lot we got the oreo and bailey's. It tasted amazing. Makes you feel like a fatass but it was very very good!  9/10  Now onto the main attraction. The burrrrgerrr. We got the el machette. My thoughts? No.  Didn't like it  won't eat it again. The bun was cold and that kinda ruined it for the start for me.... I did not love the meat but my girlfriend   did. It wasn't that good. I'm not a huge burger fan but I know when I taste a great burger. This wasn't it unfortunately.   Well not all bad news! The onion rings are fantastic! Perfectly crispy! They are amazing. Get them with a drink and bounce hahah that's it. They charged an extra dollar for the Chipotle ranch. Il stick regular ranch.  Don't charge us a buck for Chipotle ranch....come on now. Include it   Well I won't come back! Not a fan.",

The hostess was on point and welcoming, got my party of 4 seated right away. The place was 3/4 full, Lily was our server and she got us going pretty quickly. The menu was fairly straight forward, we opted for burgers first. All temps came as requested so that was good. Tomato game was solid, lettuce was lite for my taste but good. The bun was good but different, not a brioche. Not bad, just a different texture. Garlic Parm fries were some of the best, hot and flavorful. Milkshakes are over the top, good and creamy and flavorful. I'm partial to a simple chocolate shake but we had to do the Kanye type shakes since I had the posse in tow. Overall good food and service, can't wait to come back, ask for Lilly",

They are massive and looked delicious. However, I did order a delicious beer!  I chose the Funghi Burger and my boyfriend and I split an the garlic parmesan fries. My burger was cooked perfectly and had such great flavor. The parmesan fries were amazing. They had the best flavor and were served with a chive and garlic aioli. Crispy, salty and delicious.

Holsteins was a last minute decision but I couldn't have been any happier with our choice.   Since we had an early dinner planned we decided to just get something small. I shared the Donutella shake with my friend. The shake is made with Patron XO Cafe, Nutella, hazelnut croquant, pirouette cookie, chocolate coffee beans and a nutella glazed donut. Although they couldn't split it for us because of the presentation they had no issue giving us a cup and dish to split it ourselves. The shake had a nice kick to it and all the goodies in it made for a nice little breakfast. We also shared the buffalo chicken dip which was really good.   Service was excellent and the restaurant itself is comfy and casual. Definitely will be back to try out their burgers.",

Favorites were the buffalo chicken dip and the cookies and cream milkshake (I didn't want it boozy so I ordered it sans booze).   As if it wasn't indulgent enough, it came with a giant ice cream sandwich cookie on it!  Unfortunately it was really, really good. I had to have the server take it away after half so I wouldn't finish it! Definitely order a shake here.  The burger was pretty good but not the best I've ever had or anything. Nothing terribly memorable.  We came to Cosmopolitan right before heading back to LA as we normally do. With all the new food additions, Cosmo is becoming a great place to grab a bite to eat!   I would recommend trying Holstein's on your next visit- especially the chicken dip and shake.",

They start you with a bucket of delicious popcorn and some drinks. We saw some CRAZY milkshakes but decided we wanted to eat our calories instead of drink them.  We threw in a couple of appetizers and got the Buffalo Chicken dip and Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls. The dip came with tortilla chips and it was covered in celery and carrot shavings which i thought was creative. Under that was this delicious, rich and spicy buffalo chicken dip with crumbles of blue cheese. The dip was flawless! The Philly cheese steak egg rolls came out hot. These had every bit of flavor you would expect from a real cheese steak.  For dinner i ordered the Nom Nom burger with Bacon. It's a delicious cut of meat, with cheese, bacon, potato chips and thousand island dressing. I ordered it medium and it was perfectly cooked! You could taste every ingredient in every bite. This burger was amazing!   On top of all that, the service was top notch. Our waiter made sure our glasses were never empty and the food flowed perfectly. When i come back to Vegas, Holsteins is definitely on the agenda!",

During my stay at the Cosmo I went here twice.  Both times were disastrous.  The very last time was with one other person.  They sat us in the very back.  We probably should have left after seeing a couple struggle to ask for the bill.  After a long wait our waiter finally asked us what we wanted to drink.  For food, I ordered The Fun-Ghi Burger $17.50.  $17.50 is a lot for a burger right?  Oh and it doesn't come with fries or anything.  So I also got onion rings on the side.  Everything was mediocre.  My medium rare burger was more medium.  The onion rings were nothing special.  The wait for everything was terrible.  Like really terrible.  Our waiter was really bad.  Asking for a side or ranch was a struggle.  We watched a family get seated, not get served and saw the dad get up to complain to the manager there.  I felt bad that they waited forever for everything as well.  I also hated that they had only one option of shake that is dairy-free.  What year are we living in?  How can they be a shake place with one dairy-free option is beyond me.  And I can consume dairy.  Yea I will never come back.",

They eliminated the the\"Great Greek\", \"Fungi\", the \"NomNom\" and many other favorites like the chili burger. Also many of the boozy milkshakes varieties are gone too as well as the delicious sweet potato fries. The new menu is more basic and in my opinion has lesser quality and less unique toppings for the burgers. The service is the same not bad but nothing outstanding. The burger quality is still good but for the price point for a gourmet burger it is lacking on higher quality toppings and uniqueness.  There are many burger places on the strip and unfortunately Holsteins has gone from great to mediocre and does not stand out among their competition.",

The aged cheddar totally overpowered any other flavor so I didn't really taste the garlic chive aioli, and the saddest part was the one half piece of flabby thick cut bacon on my burger. Not even a whole piece of flabby bacon:( The confit tomatoes were tasty, but because they were left whole you'd get one juicy bite then a lot of bites with no tomatoes at all- bites that could have really used juicy tasty tomatoes.   I should have taken the waiters suggestion of the Forager Burger or the Fatty Patty. Our friends did and their burgers looked way better. Overall it wasn't the worst burger experience, I just expected a juicy burger and extra beefyness from the dry aged sirloin, but it was pretty disappointing. Fries were pretty good, prices aren't horrible for Vegas, and the service was good. And like I said, our friends enjoyed their burgers, but me and my bf both got the Gold Standard and thought it was just meh.",

The not great: unexpectedly, the Gold Standard burger I ordered was dry and tasteless. Even with a medium rare patty (confirmed, it was pink), the meat was dry and so bland. I slid the bun off my burger because it was stale and frankly not worth the carbs.  Pro tip: burgers don't come with fries! Order the garlic Parmesan fries if you need a side- it's a big portion so plan to share.  Overall it's a reasonably priced, decent meal, but I won't be running back to Holstein's when there are so many other options nearby.",

We saw that it had good reviews and the menu looked appealing enough to check it out  I got the Rising Sun Burger (American Waugh Burger Patty) - it was soooooo good At first I thought the burger looked a bit small, but it packed a powerful punch full of flavor. I finished it an immediately wanted to take a nap. Filled me up  Ordered a number of appetizers:  -Garlic Fries -Onion Rings -Crispy Cauliflower -Reuben Rolls  I'm from the Bay Area, and I gotta say, the garlic fries were the next best thing to agilely Garlic fries!   If you come here, definitely pair the garlic fries with your burger! (And enjoy a nice shake too)",

    "text": "I'm sad to even write this review.  I was really excited to go here, and now I really wish I hadn't.  I tried to come here on a Thursday night, and the place was packed.  Even the bar was full.  To sit anywhere was at least a 30 minute wait, so I went somewhere else.  I walked by on Friday afternoon, and there was hardly anyone there, so I decided to try it then.  I really just wanted a shake, so I sat at the bar.  The bartender came right over to me and asked if I wanted a menu, so I said yes.  I looked it over and chose the Frozen Grasshopper.  I was choosing between that and the Cookies and Cream.  Maybe the Cookies and Cream would have been better, but I'll never know.  The bartender came back and I told her I what shake I wanted, and I asked for the extra shot for $3.  She seemed kind of irritated that I didn't want any food. That may be because a waitress came up behind me to deliver my shake, so the bartenders don't make them.  Not that I knew that, or that it was my problem, but it felt like I was wasting her time.  The shake was very pretty, and I took several pictures of it before I dug in.  There is another review on here that says they got the metal shaker with their shake, too.  I did not, and I didn't even think of it at the time.  However, I wouldn't have wanted it anyway.  I'll get into that...  The pearls and the frosting on the outside of the glass were really good.  I started with eating some of them.  The whipped cream tasted funny.  It wasn't awful, but it wasn't sweet.  It was more bland.  The shake itself was terrible.  It was not like a shake, or like ice cream, and it was more like green water.  It really was awful.   So, I ate the candy off the sides and on the top, and drank some of the shake, and I was done.  All of this time, the bartender was over talking to some other waitresses.  It was fine by me because I wasn't looking to order anything else, but she was not very attentive.  When she did come over to give me my check, I was reminded that I had ordered the extra shot.  Once I realized I paid extra for it, I decided to drink some more of it since I paid $18 for it.  That proved to be a mistake...  I went to Holsteins around 4:00.  I had tickets to Backstreet Boys at 9:00, and naturally, this seems like plenty of time in between the two.  I did not feel well at all after having this shake, so I decided to go back to my room and take a nap.  I still did not feel great when I got up later, but I already had tickets, and I went to Vegas for the show, so I got ready and went.  I may have rated this place with a generous 2 stars, until about an hour into my show, this shake reared it's ugly head again, and I actually had to leave.  Fortunately I left while the dancers were on, but I still missed a song, and I had to sit rather than stand through the rest of the show (which is not at all typical).  I have seen Backstreet Boys like 40 times, and I've never once left during it before.  It broke my heart (which they'll never do...don't worry, BSB fans got that).  Luckily I made it through to the end, and walked back to my hotel and immediately went to bed.  It was my last night in Vegas, and I did not eat or drink anything after the shake I had here, and I felt fine before that.  And even if it hadn't made me sick, it was not worth drinking anyway.  So, my advice; do not come here.  I wish I hadn't.",

It's Vegas derrrr of course it's going to be expensive. If you like burgers? This local establishment is best renown for its meat establishment. The burgers are top quality some of the best we have had in Vegas. The signature Foie gras burger(can't recall the name) was cooked to perfection (medium) with head stomping flavors man so amazing with a fat juicy pice of foie gras mmmmm...mouth watering! The sweet potato fries were also super enjoyable with a good selection of dipping sauces and made for an incredible lunch!! The fries were also super enjoyable with select dipping sauces...I didn't have any house drinks or milk shakes but we will next time we visit. 100% recommend!",

I came here for my 23rd birthday with some friends. They definitely need to organize their waiting lines better though. The was some confusion because the menu was right in front of the hostess desk,and people were crowding around it. I waited for 15 min behind these people, thinking it was a line, but no, they were just crowding and didn't bother to say anything though they all saw us standing there.   Anyway, food was great! I ordered the gold standard burger and the birthday cake bamboozle shake. I'm not a big fan of bacon on my burgers, but damn, that burger was /amazing/. It was juicy and cooked to by perfection. The buns were soft, warm, and buttered generously. My friend ordered The Rising Sun. He doesn't even like burgers much (and came for the alcoholic shakes haha), but he just ate everything and proclaimed it all delicious.   The shake actually tasted like birthday cake and gave me a mild buzz. They also give you the shaker it was made in, so it's pretty much two shakes for the price of one. Friends ordered maple bacon shake and smores shake. The maple bacon had pieces of chocolate-covered bacon in it, which was strangely delicious. Smores tasted exactly like smores. I wish I had the stomach for dessert because everything they had on menu looked great. I'm definitely coming back here, so I'll make sure to order some next time.   Conclusion: Definitely try this place out! Prices are reasonable for what you get, and food is delicious!",

We sat at the bar which is great if you don't want to wait 45 minutes on a busy weekend night.  It took us a little while to be served but it gave me time to check out their solid beer list.  The spiked milkshakes will call out to you, what could be better than liquor in a milkshake, right? To me that just equals to a long night in Vegas, so I moved on.  We went with their Steakhouse burger and to try something I wouldn't expect on their menu we shared a Kalbi Beef quesadilla. The burger was good, not great, with a nice layer of black pepper on the beef, steak sauce, and choice of cheese.  The quesadilla was also good, and a great intro to Korean food, but if you are a big Korean BBQ fan you may be disappointed.  Overall a good experience and reasonably priced place to check when at the Cosmo.",

Hubs loved his Billionaire burger, which had a good chunk of foie gras. I found my Steakhouse burger a bit salty. The tomato confit, sauteed mushrooms, and marmalade onions were tasty additions to the burger itself, though.   Burgers are large, and the bottom bun is a bit too thick for my liking, although it stands up well to the toppings and creamy sauces. Fries were similarly salty. No option to sub a salad for the bun, which is rather disappointing. You can, however, pay more to sub a salad for the fries. For a heavy meal and a satisfying piece of cow, this won't disappoint.",

Holsteins was one of the first restaurants I ate at during my recent Vegas vacation and I have to say that I would definitely eat here again on my next visit.  The various burger offerings and descriptions made it difficult to choose but I finally settled on the steakhouse burger.    My burger was perfectly cooked/seasoned and was topped off with an obscene amount of grilled onions and mushrooms.  The steakcut fries were good but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the orange dreamsicle shake which was awesome and not overly rich like the grasshopper shake my buddy ordered.  Although the restaurant was rather spacious there was only one bathroom for each gender which made waiting in line a common occurrence.  I'm not sure if they have a happy hour or other drink specials (the cheeky bartender stated that every hour was \"happy\") but the drink pricing was reasonable for Vegas.",

We were looking for a place inside the Cosmo to eat (besides Wicked Spoon, which we went to more than once already) and ended up here. I was really disappointed by the food here.  I ordered the California Turkey w/ Shoestring Fries, along with a fried egg on top. I've had turkey burgers at other places before that were tasty, but this place didn't get it right at all. The meat was dry and there was no flavor to it. What made it even worse was that they stuck the big toothpick right into the fried egg. The yolk broke and started running before my dish even got to me. It got to the point where I had to use a knife and fork to eat, because the bottom of the patty got so soggy that I couldn't even pick up my burger.  Service was okay. The waitress took our orders and brought out the food pretty fast, and checked on us occasionally. When we asked to split the check by a certain amount, the waitress said she could only split it 50/50.  I would be very reluctant to come back and try this place again. I can get better tasting burgers for under $15 (about the average price here). They can't even serve a fried egg properly.",

I got the Rising Sun burger (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado) with a strawberry milkshake, and I can't decide which part of the meal was better.   The Rising Sun burger was cooked perfectly! It was a bit on the sweet side, but that was to be expected with the teriyaki glaze and yam. It was on the pricier side for a burger ($18), but the quality of the burger and the size of the burger definitely justified the price tag. Highly recommended!  But that milkshake! AMAZING!!! They were even cool enough to give us the extra that didn't fit into our glass. We basically got two milkshakes! Lots of strawberry deliciousness. Not too creamy. The perfect consistency.

    "text": "3.5ish, really, but a few factors kick it up to 4:  -hip environment. We only sat at the bar, as they were packed, but it seemed more fun there anyway. -Unique/bold ingredients on the menu. I love when a place isn't scared to try new things! -Clear identity. It's good when you know what a place is about and they don't seem too schizophrenic when you open the menu. -Tons of drinks to choose from!  We tried a few things and shared: -Kalbi Beef Quesadilla: Not bad, but not blown away. Bear in mind, I had the filling only, so perhaps with the flavors of the tortilla, it'd be better. -Shared the Steakhouse Burger: Crusted in black pepper with Holstein's creamy steak sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, WIld Mushrooms, and Swiss Cheese. Again, just ok. But, I think most burgers are 'just ok' to me now since I don't eat the bun.  The ingredients were good and put together well.  We also got a side of smoked bacon, which was nice. -Jim G had two of the many, many, many beers and I tried their Spicy Bloody Mary with Pepper&CIlantro infused vodka. Pretty good.    I wanted to try one of their many 'shakes,' full of sweet and alcohol-y goodness. But I felt the carbs were too much. I know one drunken night I'll stumble in there and order one. I'll report back =)  The food is intriguing and there's plenty more on the menu that I want to try; that factor makes me give a place a little more credit up front, since they've piqued my interest. They try to use organic products, and I'm a fan of that. And, lastly, Block 16 management group runs them; they're the same group that does Public House, which I really like too.  These people have a sense of style and uniqueness with food and decor.  Good for them!",

The burger was not cooked the way we wanted and avocado overpowered the flavor of the whole burger. I thought Holsteins was known for their buns, but it was nothing special.  I also had the pork belly buns, which was the only good entree we had at Holsteins. I would of preferred the pork belly to be more tender, but it wasn't bad.   Service was not the best either. If you are known to be open for late night dining, you have to be on top of the service too. It took us awhile to get our food and our waitress was not friendly.

The first time I ate here the burgers knocked my socks off.  The second time, I wished I had just gone to Applebee's.  It's easier to park at Applebee's, the food comes out faster, it's cheaper, and THE FOOD IS BETTER!  The saddest part: the resort restaurants keep getting away with this.

The wait was about 20 minutes on a Friday night. I ordered the Rising Sun, which was a teriyaki burger with avocado and I think fried onions. It was pretty good, but I didn't get a \"burgasm.\" I liked the shoestring fries. I only ate about half the burger, which was reasonably sized but still not worth 20 bucks. Shakes are around $13 but looked pretty good. For the most expensive burger I have ever had in my life, I don't think it was worth it but for some people I guess its a value deal in Vegas!",

While my favorite burger lives at the Barrymore (same owners as Holsteins!), Holsteins has become my favorite burger joint. I highly recommend the \"Gold Standard\", but honestly everything I've tried has been fabulous.   I'm a bit bummed the pizza twinkies are no longer around, but the buffalo chicken dip is a nice addition. Honestly I make yummier buffalo chicken dip at home, but it's nice to have someone else make it for you :)   Lastly, I urge you to try the delicious shakes! The birthday cake one is amazing, but my favorite is the first one on the menu (monkey something or other) with peanut butter and banana. YUM. With or without booze, these shakes are amazing!  From the free smoked cheddar popcorn at the beginning, to the tasty burgers, to the yummy shakes - this is one of the yummier places to get a pricey burger on the strip! While Burger Bar was the first, Holsteins is my pick for the current best !",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday for lunch. The wait for our party of 5 was around 20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering there were shops nearby to visit in the meantime. Our server was very accommodating and had all sorts of things to recommend. He brought out free popcorn for us as starters. It tasted very interesting, like spicy BBQ...  I got the Rising Sun burger which was very delicious with the fried avocado inside! Every burger also comes with a side of fries. I had ordered sweet potato fries but they gave me the regular skinny fries instead. I didn't mind because they were nice and crispy but once I let them know about the mistake, they brought out the sweet potato fries immediately which was nice. I also ordered the Frozen Grasshopper which was one of their alcoholic milk shakes with peppermint and chocolate. It was also delicious and I could not taste the alcohol at all.  Tip: if you check-in on foursquare and show your server, they will give you a free pint of draft beer! (we got this and the beer was very smooth and did not taste cheap at all)  Overall it was a very nice experience. I loved the cute cartoony cow deco all around the restaurant. Our server even made it a point to stop by and wish me a safe drive back to California when I was standing in line for the bathroom, which was not even close to our table. I thought that was a very nice gesture and topped off our visit very well.",

The price is decent and the food will surprise you (hopefully for the better). I had the brisket burger while visiting in Vegas and it made me forget about In and Out for at least a few hours. Honestly this place gets pretty creative with their burgers which I commend them for and the fries are awesome. I didn't get a shake because the beer selection was so good. I did get a pretty decent grumbly stomach after eating here but in all fairness I had been eating all sorts of junk including fried pickles and the Swedish fish candy from NY,NY hotel. I would visit again next time I'm in Vegas.",

Let's just say the duck fat fries were the biggest disappointment, they definitely need to do some research and find out what duck fat fries should be. The chicken and waffles was soooo bad, and the burger.... Let's not even go there.... So bad  So I stupidly decided to give it another try, I ordered the gold standard, i ordered it medium, and it showed up 2 minutes after i had ordered it.... Meaning that it had been precooked... Who knows how long that burger had been sitting because they were not busy enough to keep precooked burgers, and they don't even grind their own meat!!! Yeah I couldn't finish it, and I can say I'm never going back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.",

The first drop-in was for drinks and game 5, Mavs v. Heat.  The bar area was crowded and had a festive vibe.  Bartenders were attentive and gave generous pours.  Prices are in line w/ other joints on the Strip.  Second visit was for lunch with the wife.  Our server stole the show.  As a local, he gave us a few tips and can't miss, under-the-radar places we might enjoy.  After perusing the beer menu and failing to make a selection, the server brought out a hard to find NE microbrew I'd never heard of.  It was a great recommendation.  The burger was above average, but not the best I've eaten, but would order again.  I shall definitely return for the beer",

What made this place PERFECT was that I had my birthday dinner here for a group of 31.  The staff accommodated every single one of us...including 2 children.  For being 2 weeks old, I was VERY impressed that the staff never missed a beat. As far as food goes...I had the Lobster Roll and the Lobster Mac n' Cheese. The Lobster Roll was amazing...almost like I was in Boston.  The Lobster Mac n' Cheese was also very good, but the most impressive part about the dish was the tiny bite size Lobster BLT served to the side.  It has so much flavor you want more. I was able to try some of the shakes, but one that stood out was the Campfire S'more.  I just remember the tastiness of the shake...then the warm sensation of the alcohol going down my throat.  What I like better was the malt. Everyone in my group was too full for dessert, however, the staff brought out the Candy Shop item off the menu in celebration for my birthday.  The only way I can describe it is that it had an interesting array of flavors and textures. I've been going to Vegas for a long time and this is the only place on The Strip where you can get a GREAT sit-down meal for reasonable prices.",

The waiter asked if we wanted to speak to the manager which we thought he understood as yes. Manager never came to our table and we were charged the extra for the changes. Pretty ridiculous and probably a petty complaint, but I don't think if I'm getting less I should be charged more or if something is on the side it should cost more. Just my opinion.",

    "text": "This placed used to be super fantastic but has plummeted to mediocre at best in food and service. The best part of coming here a few years back was the Kobe beef burger and the massive selection of fun boozy shakes. Eleven to choose from! But times they are a changing. First of all i ordered the cookies and cream shake (pictured) and it was phenomenal but it was one of only 6 options. I don't know what happened to the other 5 but they have been eliminated from our consideration.  I chose to order the California Turkey in hopes of it being a lighter choice. I'd much rather save those empty calories for the shake. Hindsight revealed I shouldn't have ordered it at all. Based on the menu description and my waitress' option of \"would I like that on white or wheat bread\" I thought I was getting a turkey sandwich. What I got was a dried up patty of tasteless ground turkey between a bun. Not the wheat bread I was offered. There was no avocado at all and the \"spouts, cucumber slaw\" was sparse at best and LOADED with salt!  The avocado was completely absent along with the Russian dressing. I unfortunately opted for the sweet potato fries for an additional $2.50 and was left completely perplexed. Exactly what kind of manipulation process is done to remove any and all flavor from a sweet potato?  I didn't know that was possible let alone a process worthy of a $2.50 charge.  Our waitress, upon delivery of our shake, informed us that she was supplying us with a drip plate for the ginormous ice cream sandwich that she guaranteed would melt on us. She also took it upon herself to let us know that we should probably stop eating our turkey sawdust and eat the ice cream before it melts. Three times. She stopped by 3 times. Each time with a little more attitude because we weren't taking her seriously that ice cream does indeed melt.  What once used to be on our \"places to go\" list on our annual Vegas trip has moved down the ladder to \"just keep walking and don't make eye contact\" list.  Vegas offers too many amazing restaurants to waste your winnings here.",

The burger tasted pretty good however the cook on the patty was unsatisfactory.  I also ordered the onion rings with a side of ranch dressing. Onion rings were pretty tasty and the breading was good, however the ranch dressing came out towards the end of the meal. When it came time to pay, it took a solid 20 minutes for the server to come check on us with the bill. Gave this place 2 stars primarily for the service and for slow it was.  This could be because our server was slammed, however the place wasn't completely packed.",

And the food was pretty good, albeit a bit overpriced but I'm in the center of the strip so I can't complain.   The burger we ordered was the rising sun and it was actually pretty delicious. Me and my friend shared it and the beef was tender and the sauce on it was sweet which went well with the savory patty. Their fries were also super crunchy which we loved.   We ended up ordering the cookies and cream shake because I mean since we're here we might as well get one of their epic $15 shakes. It came out and there was an entire ice cream sandwich on top. Needless to say I was very happy. They also gave us the extra shake that didn't fit inside of the milkshake glass which we appreciated! The shake itself tasted like a very basic oreo cookies and cream shake. You could kind of taste a hint of the booze but not a lot. The ice cream sandwich on top was pretty good, but it was very very messy.  I'd come back here again with some friends from out of town or a fun night out. But it's pretty pricey.  One burger and a shake came out to 45 bucks. Spend an extra 5 and you could to go wicked spoon ;)",

    "text": "REVIEW for EVENT at HOLSTEINS 11/18/17:  I recently hosted a bachelorette party in Las Vegas, so since we were staying at the Cosmo I figured it would be best to host a lunch event at Holsteins.  Now I've been to Holsteins many times, so I was familiar with their shakes and phenomenal burgers, this is review is strictly for the event.   First off, communication.  I filled out some information to get contacted via their webpage for an event, and I was promptly contact the next day by Ku'uipo.  I received an email with options for the prix-fixe menu.  They had a very reasonable per person minimum spend for a party of between 15-20 people on a Saturday lunch. Once I communicated my details to Ku'uipo I was promptly issued contract details with a final guest count TBD a few weeks before the event.    Next, changes. One thing that really made my day is that I was able to change the menu throughout the process and Ku'uipo was so helpful and prompt getting the menu changes done.  Also they have an online service that generates your menu and contract so changes can be seen quickly.  I really appreciated that so i didn't have to keep going through emails of .pdfs to find the most recent menu/contract.  It made this event really convient to do.  Lastly, service.  Again, I could go on and on about how delicious the food was and how grand the milkshakes are, but the service we received for our party of 15 was phenomenal.  The manager, whose name I am so bummed I forgot, took exceptional care for our party.  We had 2 girls have to miss the event due to family emergencies and was so nice to let us get their burgers to go and also comp 2 milkshakes for our party.  I know that having a large party puts stress on a kitchen, so I can't begin to explain how amazing that was.  Also we never had to ask for refills nor were we waiting long for food once our individual orders were placed.  Our waitress and bussers were on point. Again I wish I could remember their names, but we were the only party of 15 on Saturday, November 18th from 11:30-1:30pm, so please tell them I truly appreciate their service.  If you are in vegas for a birthday, bachelorette, bachelor party with a large group, I highly recommend booking Holsteins for an event.  They will go out of their way to accommodate you and it will leave a lasting impression on your guests.",

    "text": "With some great milk shakes, Holstein's is a nice place to chill with friends but the sides are just okay.  Leaving somewhat unfulfilled from our day at the Marquee Dayclub, my friends and I decided to roll over to Holstein's for some shakes.  In all honesty, the trip was mainly to satisfy our munchies and I am glad that the milkshakes, at least, were good.  It seems like a lot of other reviews rave about the burgers which may be a reason why I was underwhelmed.  Here are some of the things that we tried:  Ahi Poke Tostadas- Although beautifully presented, these bite size tostada pieces were just okay and I would not recommend.  Sure there is some avocado aioli that goes well with the ahi but for me it was on the bland side.  The only source of heat came from the piece of jalapeno which was a little too strong of a flavor profile to enjoy the meat.  Buffalo Chicken Dip - I can handle my spice, but it was slightly spicier than I would like and definitely required the dip to help with the heat.  If you are looking for something spicy, this would be it.  Natural Cut Fries/Sweet Potato Fries - These were cooked well but were nothing special.  Buttermilk Onion Rings - Their buttermilk onion rings were probably one of the best I have had.  The coating was nice and crispy and inside was a hot well cooked piece of onion in the middle.  Of all the sides, I would recommend these.  Milkshakes - If there was another thing that I really enjoyed were the milkshakes  I had the Black and White which was rich and creamy with a nice balance of chocolate and vanilla.  What I was surprised was that that they not only have the nicely presented milkshake in one glass and another cup with the leftover.  My friend also got the alcoholic ones and they are deceptive!  He got a major hangover afterwards so beware!  Another plus here was the service.  My pretty big group of friends were seated pretty quickly and the waitress we had was super friendly and attentive even on a fairly busy day.  Holstein's is located on the floor with most of the restaurant.  Overall, Holstein's has okay food but has nice milkshakes that are worth trying if that's what you are in the mood for.  However, I am willing to come back to try their burgers.",

    "text": "Wagyu beef... great, you managed to cook it medium as ordered, congrats you passed culinary 101. But near everything else about my VGK burger was lacking drastically. The beer jam was basically MIA, I get it's a strong flavor but so little was put on it tasted (or actually was) entirely absent. Creamy horseradish... well examining both sides of the patty it seems a very conservative squirt was applied, not even enough to cover 50% of the area of the patty/bun. You could taste hints of it, I guess since horseradish is also a strong flavor, but again it was so stingily put on it was on the level of a fast food burger, appeared to be just a hasty squirt to check the box with no care for even and full application so the beholder could actually enjoy what it brought to the burger as a whole. The crispy onion was there and sufficient. The cheese near was in the same spot as the sauces, there but not what any caring chef could justify as a full portion to distribute its flavor in every bite. I asked for extra of the sauces on the side when the waiter came back but was only provided with beer jam no horseradish. Sigh. Resigned to the fact that this experience was going to be substandard pretty much no matter what at this point. I will say the regular fries were on point and enjoyable, but at $19 for a burger it seems a ripoff to pay $6 more to have the most basic side of fries. Throw a tiny portion on the plate, with an option to upgrade to a fuller portion for more $$$. The barren plate that made the \"large\" burgers (as the waiter commented multiple times) appear not very large whatsoever seemed very odd... and like you're getting ripped off. The only reasons I'm giving 2 stars are the patty itself being cooked well and the fries tasting quite good. Definitely not enough to bring me back or think to recommend this place to anyone else. Service was slow, the place was not packed so I can't really justify it. One of my compatriots grabbed some fries and set them on his plate as the waiter was clearing plates from others in our party, and then immediately asked him if he could take his plate too, after he watched him load up on more fries, what? After we had the bill and a card in the folder being handed to him he asked he could take care of it for us, what? No, we'd rather you didn't take care of it because nothing about this experience justified the bill. Disappointing, overpriced, underwhelming, over-hyped.",

Tasteful, full of juice and flavor. I usually like my meat medium rare, but the waitress recommend rare stating that medium rare would be really red and bloody. Ummmmmm it was not red enough! Burgers were still good but wished it was more red. Staff was very friendly, and there was no wait at all during lunch time. Fries weren't that great, but I need to try the shakes next time.",

Like when you go to the good 7-11's and they have the slurpee machine turned up high enough and don't put too much syrup on it.  Fluffy goodness!  Pizza Twinkies:  Looked like a twinkie...tasted like a pizza.  Yum!    Crispy Pork Belly Sliders:  Kind of like peking duck, but with crispy fried pork belly.  The bun was made from scratch.  It was chewy, fluffy, just sheer perfect!  The 2nd time we came and just grabbed a drink...The Funky Monkey or something...a banana milk shake with alcohol in it.  Yum!!!!  Third time we came was before leaving for the airport, and almost ended up missing our flight, but it was worth it.    Fried Green Tomatoes with popcorn shrimp togo!  It stayed crispy the whole way to the airport!  Coke float with vanilla ice cream and cherry vodka and chocolate covered poprocks.  OMG.  Orgasmic!  Great prices.  Great drinks.  Great food!    Viva Las Vegas!",

It was juicy and flavorful, but I kinda wish I didn't have the billionaire burger as the expectation was way too high.  It was still pretty good though.  The shake was amazing.

IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THE WAITRESS COULDN'T HEAR ME OVER THE LOUD MUSIC!  Seriously. Had a reservation, got seated, and quite literally the waitress had a hard time taking our party of four orders BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Worse we couldn't understand a thing she said/asked either BECAUSE THE MUSIC WAS SO LOUD. Each of our four orders  went something like this.  Customer, \"I'll have the _____ burger.\"  Waitress, \"Which one?\" Customer, \"The _____ burger.\" Waitress, now pointing to the menu, \"Which one?\" Customer now also points to the burger on the menu. Waitress, \"The _____ burger? How would you like that cooked?\" Customer, \"What?\" Waitress, now shouting very slowly, \"HOW ... WOULD ... YOU ... LIKE ... THAT ... COOKED?\" Customer, now also shouting very slowly, \"MEE ... DEE ... UMM ... RARE!\" Waitress, \"WHAT KIND OF FRIES WOULD YOU LIKE?!\" Customer, \"WHAT?!\" Waitress, sighs.  Customer, sighs.  As noted in other reviews the food is prepared well and is quite tasty but not sizeable. Burgers are about the size of a regular fast food burger. You get choice of fries, either steak or shoestring. Again, the amount is the size of a standard fast food fry. The shakes are also good but, again, not sizeable. On average 1 burger & fry + 1 shake = $30 with tax and tip.  So using the taste vs. cost vs. size vs. uncomfortable ambiance equation we arrive at a mere 1 star.  WHAT?  I SAID ONE STAR!  WHAT?! sigh.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a burger connoisseur, and as I've written several times on Yelp: I don't consider a burger to be great because of the toppings -- that is icing on the cake -- but because of the quality of the meat and the charbroiled taste. If it doesn't taste like a burger off of backyard charcoal grill, I am not going to rate the burger too highly.  This burger delivered. I had the Classic, though I wish I had chosen the Gold Standard for the toppings. The burger was large in portion, served on a perfect bun, and tasted like a charcoal grilled burger with excellent meat quality.   I chose the shoe string fries to accompany my burger. They were ok, but next time I'd choose the other fries. They appeared more fresh and well seasoned.   The beer selection, both bottle and draft, includes some of the best regional and craft beers from around the country. Any restaurant or bar with a Cider is impressive to me, and I enjoyed the Sin Cider here.   The atmosphere is trendy, the service was friendly, the prices were reasonable ($14.99 for burger and fries), and the quality was just right.",

I wasn't so wild about it, but they offer a VEGAN burger (the Urth Burger) on their menu so kudos for being vegan inclusive!  It's kind of an odd texture, more like felafel than a veg burger.  Unique is a good word.  It was okay.  I'm pretty sure its made of mostly chickpeas and corn.  The shoestring fries were pretty amazing though.  Also, the alcoholic shakes are pretty excellent.  Unfortunately only one works for the dairy free crowd.  The smoking passion (or something like that) is Hangar One Mandarin Vodka (see my review on St. George Spirits in Alameda, CA... Hangar One is prob the best vodka I've ever had) and lemon sorbet.  Very tasty.  Definitely a decent choice for a vegan dining out with meat eaters.",

Let's just say that my partner is a finicky drink man, and Allison worked him like putty, awing him with drink after drink.  The \"AJ SPECIAL\" with Smirnoff Whipped Vodka, Ciroc Coconut Vodka, Pineapple Juice, Coconut Sorbet was amazing.  OK, enough about the drinks - let's talk burgers.  You can't go wrong with any burger.  Of course, get it medium rare or rare.  By the time we left (wobbled out), the line was out the door and around the corner.",

I bookmarked this place before my last Vegas trip because I'm a huge sucker for gourmet burgers and I really wanted to try this place. The opportunity finally came, so I came here for dinner.  Not everyone in our group wanted burgers, so we got our food to go. You order and wait at the bar for to-go orders. After much contemplation, I decided to go with The Rising Sun (with shoestring fries) because there were a lot of good reviews for it and it was a unique combination of ingredients for a burger. Well, it was a good choice! It certainly was a unique combo of flavors, and it worked. I don't usually go for the Asian-themed item in a menu, but being a burger, it ended up being a good fusion item. The fries were alright. Not the best I've had.  I would definitely come here again to try another one of their many unique offerings.",

The meat was flavorful and moist and cooked medium rare like I asked, but the rest of my classic burger was unremarkable. I thought the burger was a fair size but the delicious fries that came as a side disappeared so fast! It comes in a tiny cup that is around 4 oz. The service was really fast but almost too fast - we couldn't get anyone's attention when we wanted an extra plate and our salad was whisked away before we finished it.

    "text": "I must first state that I was a solid 3 on this; however, what happened once we left really soured my mood along with my stomach.   I must also be clear that this was my first - and subsequently, only - meal of the day.   First, the food: My trusty companion and I each had a burger. I had the flagship \"Gold Standard\" and she had the \"El Machete\".   The Gold Standard is made with dry aged beef, which is a good choice, and topped with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar and arugula. This should be delicious, and I assume if seasoned properly it is. Unfortunately, there was too much salt seasoning - and believe me... I LOVE SALT - which left the Gold Standard feeling merely Standard.   My Tardis companion had the \"El Machete\" which is a spicy aoli and pepper based burger. This was actually delicious from the two bites I had. If there was any seasoning issue with the burger itself it was covered by the delicious peppers and aoli!  Along with that we had regular fries and sweet potato fries. The fresh cut fries were tasty, albeit again heavily bathed in salt. The sweet potato fries were on the soggy side but fresh and not overly salted.   We also had milkshakes. Hers being some fruit compote Fourth of July special concoction and mine being chocolate strawberry. Mine was very sweet but it was strawberry with chocolate sauce, so of course that was unsurprising. (I had asked for chocolate ice cream but I wasn't about to whine about the small oversight.)  As we left, I thought \"unspectacular... but worth a second look\".  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great. I figured that I might try it again when next in town.   Not long after my companion and I started feeling sour in our stomachs. Come dinner time, still sour... I have slightly upchucked and swallowed it back down on two occasions. Even as I write this, the meal from lunch feels like it is remaining in the upper regions of my stomach and the gassy bloating remains.  We tried later to force a small meal elsewhere for consistency as it was getting late but we couldn't even touch our food. It literally went into the box the same way it came to the table.   I really didn't intend on writing a negative review... and many of the reviews are positive. I would like to think this is an isolated incident in which I suspect the culprit to be the milkshakes.   I really wanted to like this place. The menu is creative.  The decor is attractive. There are a dozen reasons to be drawn to this place.  Unfortunately, I went from \"looking forward to eating there\" to \"pondering a second chance\" to \"likely not looking forward to a future visit\"...   If not for the promise and potential of my initial thoughts, compared to the way I feel right now, it would have resulted in one star. So in fairness, I decided to average the two opinions.   All in all a very disappointing visit. Thank god for Pepto.",

    "text": "I am giving this place 3.5 stars. The service was weird from the start. We had a party of five, and they made us wait 10 minutes when the restaurant only had about 5 tables full. We sat down, were handed menus, and our waiter never came by for another 10 minutes. One of us had to ask someone for water, and ask for a waiter. The waiter also took forever to come back to take our orders.  From there, it seemed like he tried to redeem himself the entire time. We finally ordered. I had the billionaire burger for $28. It was a kobe beef patty with foie gras, onions, frisee, and truffle mayo. The burger was really good and filling. I only ate half. It came with a  side of fries and I mistakenly chose the shoestring fries. The steak fries were much better. Oh yea, the waiter bought us buckets of fries while we waited for our food to try to suck up to us. It came with a house made ketchup that was really good.   My friend's burger was sent back to the kitchen twice. He asked for a well done patty, and it came out super rare that it bled all over the plate. Second, they forgot the grilled onions.  Lastly, the waiter called the manager over to give us free dessert of liquid nitrogen meringues.   Overall, the burgers and fries were fine, but the service was weird.",

    "text": "I'd love to appoint 5 stars -- but the service was definitely lacking.   Situated inside the Cosmo, right across from the Chandelier bar, Holstein's is super modern, bright and spacious.  We put our name in and were told it'd be a 20-30 minute wait. They take your phone number so they can call to tell you -- only I had HORRIBLE reception inside the Cosmo, so I missed the call and returned to the front desk about 10 minutes after they called.  We were seated immediately, which was great.  While perusing the menu, some bacon/cheddar infused popcorn came out in a little metal pail, courtesy of the chef.    There were so many burgers to choose from. We chose the big fat Greek burger and the surf and turf mini-burgers.  Thankfully, we had decided to share because the Greek burger was THE best burger I think I may have ever eaten.  I'm drooling a little bit just thinking about it. Lamb, tatziki, red onion, feta cream... bursting with flavor.  The surf and turf mini-burgers were just meh even with the bearnaise sace.   Now, the most shocking part of the menu wasn't their amazing beer selections or even the bamboozled milkshakes -- but that their \"fat\" fries (as I call them) were GOOD. If you follow me on here at all, you know that I have a strong aversion to anything but shoestring fries for the fry/flavor ratio.  These were perfectly seasoned; I definitely snuck more than a couple from my friends plate. hehe  Based on the service we received -- I'd suggest not being in a rush to get anywhere or in the mood to order something additional. The girls sitting next to us waited for easy 20 minutes before the server came over to give them their bill after asking for it and then there was a discrepancy.  Only after another 15, they didn't want to wait anymore to deal with it and just called it a loss.  When it came time for us to order another drink, our server was no where to be found.  It was almost a joke.   So why would I go here again?  That Greek burger. Seriously - amazing. I'm pretty sure the Korean burger would've been really good too, so I'll go back for the food knowing service is going to be slow.",

    "text": "Out of all the places we experienced this trip to Vegas, this was by far the most memorable, happy and delicious dining experience we had!     Let me just say I'm a huge Top Chef fan.  Also a huge Yelper.  So I had done a lot of research before our trip to Vegas, and this was on my top 3 list to experience on this adventure.  Having been a fan of Carlos on Top Chef (darn those macaroons that did him in), I really wanted to try his restaurant and husband liked the sounds of burgers and shakes.    So, early on a Monday night, we stepped into Holsteins, was greeted warmly and shown to our table.  Waitress was quick and friendly.  Service could not have been better.  We were brought some bbq popcorn to start (neat touch)...I ordered a glass of wine (sorry, know it should've been a shake, but I knew I could count on Husband for that and he did indeed order the Birthday cake one).  Having eaten at Wicked Spoon earlier in the day, we opted to share a burger.       THE STEAKHOUSE BURGER* / 16.5 BEEF PATTY CRUSTED WITH BLACK PEPPER,  HOLSTEINS CREAMY STEAK SAUCE, MARMALADE  ONIONS, TOMATO CONFIT, WILD MUSHROOMS, SWISS CHEESE.      I asked that the mushrooms be served on the side for my husband as I don't do mushrooms.  (no problem).  He chose shoestring fries for the side.      I asked the waitress if the \"Top Chef\" happened to be there on a Monday night?  (surely he would not be?)  She said she didn't know but would check.  Next thing I know he's not only there but coming out of the kitchen to meet us!  What a delightful friendly guy!  AND he informed us that he had hired Craig from the same Top Chef series.  Yep.  A little while later Carlos came out with Craig!  Husband took my picture with both of them!  Oh my gosh, I'm such a geek, but geez these guys worked their tails off on that show and I so respected them and appreciated them for it.  And now I was not only meeting them but eating their food!  This burger was the best burger I've ever had (sorry Bobby Flay, you've finally been surpassed).  And fortunately Husband's shake made him so full he couldn't finish his half of the burger so I got it.  (waitress later told us that it had FIVE scoops of ice cream in it).     So, full, dessert was mentioned.  I said we were full but had heard about the donuts.  No they didn't serve them any more except with a particular drink.  I expressed sadness to not be able to try it.  Next thing I know, here comes two donut holes, one for each of us, with a cream filling...maple and BACON.  YUM YUM YUM.     THANK YOU Holsteins for our favorite dining experience on this trip to Vegas!  Excellent waitress (sorry I can't remember your name), thank you too and Carlos and Craig, please know you MADE our trip to Vegas this time!",

We were guided to the lounge and promised full service - yet 5-10 minutes later no one come by to even greet us.  Additionally, group of 3 ladies took the booth right next to us and were waited on almost immediately while we were promptly ignored.  We asked to be moved to a table and politely made our wait time known to both the front and back area hostesses.  The hostess who showed us to our seat assured me that we were seated in \"her favorite waitress' area and she'd send her right over.\"  Well, after several more minutes of being ignored (a female waitress gave 2 tables within arms reach a check and cleaned off their table without ever making eye contact with us) a male server finally came over to take our order.  I was supremely frustrated and ready to leave when a server arrived. Overall it really put a damper on our Las Vegas experience, even though I was dressed in trendy cocktail attire and my companion in a button up shirt and khakis, we were still feeling deliberately ignored by at least 2 servers, and our current server seemed a little apologetic but never said so and didn't offer us anything to make up for it.  I fully regret not leaving before ordering.",

    "text": "So my friend who has a great palate tells me we have to try this \"burger joint\" and picks it over Mastro's Steak House.  Really? Burgers over Steak?  So after about 30 minutes I realize he is not joking and I find myself and 3 other friends @ The Cosmo Holsteins location.    We were sat down right away ( I took this as a bad sign) and given menus that were covered in plastic.  Great, I turned down one of the best steak houses for this?  They have a full bar so we ordered Manhattans and Old Fashions.  The waitress was friendly and helpful enough, thanks Ashley.  Okay so I do remember this place being mentioned on a TV show and the \"Billionaire Burger with 100% Kobe Beef,  Foie Gras, and Truffle mayo\" was ranted and raved about.  Fine.  I love Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, and am a Truffle man so I ordered it.  At $32 for a burger, this thing better be good.  Went for the Onion Rings for $2 more, $16.50 for the Lobster Mac and Cheese, $16 for Fried Pickles (not my choice), $16.50 for the Country fried Bacon, and my colleges ordered spiked shakes while I passed.  Lobster Mac and Cheese was, well, watery and just so so.  One of my friends loved the stuff.  The fried pickles reminded me of deep fried zucchini but crispy and salty. Another one of my friends lectured me about pickles and how good they were.  Okay.  The Country Fried Bacon stole the show for the appetizers.  This was a thick slice of pork belly and was oh so good.  4 total pieces were gone in seconds.  Now one friend ordered the Memphis Burger that had pulled pork on top of kobe beef and bbq sauce.  He was digging his burger.  Another guy had the Big Fat Greek which is Lamb and reminded him of the best gyro he's ever had.  The dude ordered lamb in a hamburger place.  Whatever.  My other buddy and I ordered the Billionaire Burger.  Okay so mind you, this friend frequents 3 Star Michelin Restaurants and runs bills over $400 for dinner.  I also enjoy fine dining so when he mention this restaurant...Anyway.  This quite possibly was one of the best meals I've ever had.  Yes I know it's a burger, yes I realize half the food on the table were deep fried, and again yes I know we were drinking milk shakes (they were not me) with our meals but WOW!  This Billionaire Burger was ridiculously stupid good.  It took me 25 minutes to finish it because I savored every bite, seriously.  I refused to drink anything so that the tastes can blend and linger in my mouth it was so good.  I couldn't believe I was eating a freaking hamburger that put a smile on my face so big my cheeks hurt.  I loved this burger so much I left a $20 tip.    Not for the faint of heart when it comes to $$$, granted we drank, one of us heavily (again not me) with hard drinks and tried 1/2 the menu but still a bit of sticker shock running up a $275 bill for 4 burgers, 10 mixed drinks, 2 shakes, and 3 appetizers.",

The service here was horrible. They never come by to check up on you nor seem to care. All the servers seem to have this haughty attitude to them. My salad came out without the chicken I requested. Once I told them it took forever for them to bring out the chicken. The food is just as bad. Chicken was way too dry and looks gross. The burger lacked flavors and the patty was also super dry. We had to flag them down for them to bring us condiments. Who doesn't need ketchup or mustard at a burger joint?!  Maybe one of these days I will muster up the courage to give them a second chance but for now, pass!",

    "text": "OMG super disappointed like no other.  FYI: came here at night and they card you to get in. super loud music. if you come at night they only serve the late night menu which is a total bummer.  Ordered:  *we order shoe string fries. i have had them before many many times in my life time. yelpers even posted pictures of shoe string fries that they have ordered from here. however apparently the fries that came out looked like regular sized fries. when i asked the server stated yes they are shoe string fries. i must be born yesterday! for reals that was strike number one!   *we ordered a holsteins beef $12. the menu said tiny bun. which makes us think its a small burger. comes to find out that what they meant by that is sliders. when asked. the waitress stated: it was all they had. seriously. thanks for the heads up! honestly, good service= please brief your customers on what they are ordering. especially when you have asked them if it was their first time and their answer was yes. lacked in flavor. nothing that made me go YUM or OoOoooo. mcdonald's have better burgers.  *bucket of buffalo wings $13. one of the worst wings i've had as well. tyson frozen buffalo wings are even better than this. this item was not even finished. if you order this ask for a side of buffalo sauce to dip it in.   observation:   saw staff standing around talking by the register thing. made me think of resturant stakeout. i wished he would've been recording the staff because that's totally unprofessional.  thoughts: *love the unique decor. its really cool.  *service was just poor. i even left a comment on their comment card. *never coming back!  *overly priced items. *presentation wise was decent.   tips: *credit card and cash accepted. *tons of seating area. they just might not have enough staff so they'll make you wait awhile. *there's a bar area. *located in the cosmopolitan hotel.",

    "text": "Wow. Holsteins is definitely a memorable place with their flashy cartoon graphics and crazy milkshakes. You're surrounded with playfulness, regardless of it's the cow-filled interior or the food. The hamburgers were just good, nothing more or less. I really enjoyed the rising sun, but didn't care for the other two (the fun ghi & billionaire burger) that we got. French fries and sweet potatoes were okay, nothing spectacular at all. Though, the crispy onion rings were bomb! Now, on to the decorated milkshakes! They were all delicious (banana split, the frozen grasshopper, campfire smores), though on the sweeter side (but I mean, it's milkshakes right?). The presentation was awesome, and I think that's what makes me like their milkshakes even more. I barely ate the toppings they included in the milkshake as it was just, so. much. sugar. But, I couldn't let the milkshake go to waste and drank it all the way back to LA. In general, the restaurant is between a 3 and 4 because it's slightly pricey ($120 total) for these fancy hamburgers and shakes that felt like way too much carbs, sugar, salt, sauce, and candy for one sitting. But I would recommend friends to try, hence the 4 star. I think it's a fun experience and worth waiting half an hour for (we went without reservations on Sunday around noon), especially with the casinos and other little stores in the Cosmopolitan.",

I absolutely adore cows so I felt the need to come in and take a picture with the giant pink cow statue in the middle of the restaurant. After my pic we decided to stay at the bar. Bridgot was the BEST bartender of the entire weekend. Nice, inviting, and totally sweet. Her service was amazing and she chatted with us like it was a dead dive bar on a week day and not a crowded Vegas bar on a Saturday. Quick, efficient, attentive and charming. We will be back for her!

It looks really warm and inviting.    Service: 3 - The service was okay, they were friendly enough. But after they served us our food, they basically never really came back to refill anything and it was a little hard to get their attention.   Food: 3 - Waiting for your order is cute, they give you some gourmet popcorn in a pail. I ordered the Gold Standard Burger and the Drunken Monkey Shake. The Burger was just okay. It was good, but it wasn't anything special. The price does not justify the taste whatsoever. I've had similar tasting burgers for way cheaper in other hotels, as well. Although, they do have really good presentation of the food.   The shake was good. I mean really good. I'm not really a fan of peanut butter, but wow, I would probably order the Drunken Monkey shake again. Also, I don't want to sound \"super thirsty\" because the shake was good, but I really wish there could have been more alcohol. Or at least some kind of kick somewhere. But it was a very good milkshake!   I would definitely come back to have more shakes! People rave about them, and they really are the star of this place :)",

    "text": "Everyone knows by now about my love for BUNS, but when I go to Holsteins, it's all about their Bam-Boozled Shakes!   So when I'm in Vegas on business or pleasure (cue the music):  I stay out too late Got nothing but shakes to obtain That's what people say, mmm-mmm That's what people say, mmm-mmm  I go on too many Vegas dates  But I can make my company pay At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm That's what people say, mmm-mmm  But I keep boozing Can't stop, won't stop choosing It's like I got this cute chick In my mind Saying, \"It's gonna be better than getting a quick bite\"  'Cause the Card-Players gonna play, play, play, play, play And the Waiters gonna wait, wait, wait, wait, wait Baby, I'm just gonna get a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake The Bakers gonna bake, bake, bake, bake, bake And the Bartending Shake-makers gonna make, make, make, make, make Baby, I'm just gonna get a shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  SHAKES I'VE HAD: -The Drunken Monkey: being comprised of Reese's & Banana made it an easy choice for the 1st shake I ever had here. It contains Frangelico hazelnut liqueur! -Pumpkin Pie: pumpkin lovers like myself can rejoice because this treat is offered year-round, instead of being seasonal. It features Pumpkin Pie Filling, Graham Crumble, Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka, & Pepitas Brittle. This was the tastiest one I've had. -Cereal Bowl 2.0: one of their most popular, it has Fruit Loops & Cap'N Crunch mixed with 3 Olives Loopy Vodka. -The Fat Boy: ok, I didn't try this one, but after consuming a shake here, people mistook for me being the fat boy.  You can't really feel the effects of the alcohol, but it doesn't matter because they're SO DAMN GOOD anyway. Expecting to get buzzed off any of them is like going to Britney Spears' show to hear live music.  They give you the shake excess in a tin also, so it's like you're practically getting 2.   FOOD NOTES: -The Crazy Bird: if you're not into burgers but want buns still (and a chicken breast), this is my recommendation as the garlic aioli sauce gives it the right touch. -If you have a burger or sandwich and get a shake too, you're going to be as full as a Vegas club's guest list on NYE. So, consider sharing items. -Truffle Lobster 'Mac N Cheese' ($16.50): I ordered this my first visit, and it didn't live up to the hype. I was underwhelmed by the portion too, but found the crispy breading crust pleasing.  OTHER NOTES: -bar seating is available -there are times at nights (even on weekends) when it's not that busy -Holsteins is not owned by Cosmo, so you can't charge it to your room  Although the charges can easily start to add up if you order several things, I don't really have an issue with the prices here. Since it's Vegas, I just \"Shake it Off, I Shake it Off.\"",

I've eaten here twice now: once at the bar/lounge and once at a table. I have to say, I think I prefer the bar area better. Its atmosphere is a little more what I expect from the Cosmo and the low couches make for an intimately casual dining setting.   The food is good. The appetizers are what I would recommend. They're different and truly give you the opportunity to sample something new. And they're filling! Their burgers and sandwiches are also a safe bet, especially if you've got more of an appetite and are not watching your figure for that night's clubbing activities.   The service is good, not stellar. But it's what you'd expect, I suppose. The one downside of this place is the amount of salt they use on everything, especially their shoestring fries!

At that point almost anything would taste great.  Holsteins came highly recommended and after sleeping through the breakfast hour it was time to skip directly to lunch anyway.  When presented with a burger voted Vegas's best, it's hard to consider anything else.  I went with the Gold Standard Burger and wasn't disappointed.  Sweet Potato fries were another plus. To top things off I ordered one of the \"boozy milkshakes\", going with the Oreo and Bailey's version (I wasn't adventurous enough to go for the Captain Crunch).  I left plenty satisfied and a little overstuffed, but overall I would recommend this place for a hearty lunch or dinner (skipping breakfast was a good call).",

It was so freaking delicious, with a fried egg, tender burger, and flavorful kimchi. And now it's GONE, just like that! =(  When we first came, it was even our server who made the recommendation for us to order this burger. Please, we beg of you, to bring it back! It is the sole reason we kept coming back in the first place! Ah we miss it too much!  Instead, I had to find something else on the menu, which was really difficult seeing that the decision to come here for dinner was only because I wanted to get the Bull-gogi again. I ended up getting the El Machete burger, which I don't recall being on the menu before (I believe the Bull-gogi was swapped out for this new burger). It was decent and the flavors melded well, but still wasn't mind-blowing enough for me to want to come back =(. Pooooo!!",

    "text": "My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Bilionaire Burger - HOLY S***.  Talk about TOTAL MOUTH RICHNESS TO THE MAXXX.  Here's the thing.. I love foie gras to begin with so there was no hesitation at all to get this burger.  And being from Cali, I had to get it since it's banned here.  Anyway, they were very generous with the foie gras portion.  It was fatty, melt in your mouth goodness.  The \"kobe\" beef patty was fatty and meaty at the same time.  Huge on True BEEF flavor.  I quote \"kobe\" because we should all know by there that REAL kobe beef cannot be sold outside of Japan.  ANYWAY, the truffle mayo was the perfect schmear to compliment all the components in the burger.  The port marmalade onions helped to cut the richness and fattiness of the burger because it had a very distinct vinegar taste.  The brioche bun was toasty, crispy but soft, and buttery as brioche should be.  It holds up well to the rest of the burger.  The frisee was well, frisee and also helped to balanced out the richness of this burger.  I did split this with my girlfriend because I knew beforehand that this burger would more than likely be close to overwhelming on the palette.  Each bite was so rich I felt as if I died each time.  Frozen Grasshopper Shake - YUM!!!! I love chocolate mint to begin with, but when you add chocolate vodka to it, it just makes the shake 100x better.    OVERALL:  Enjoyed this place very much.  I would definitely consider coming back here to try what else they have to offer.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!",

So we came back and sat down, looking forward to shakes and stuff.  We come to find out that shakes are not served late night.  Why be called \"Holsteins Shakes and Buns\"?  So I order two drinks... $30 later.  I was highly disappointed.  Came back the next day for lunch.  We did not receive any popcorn like the other tables... Is that saying something?  We ordered shakes, fries, and wings.  Nothing else looked that appetizing.  Yeah my shake packed a kick but was soooo overly sweet- cremee brulee.  My sister got the oreo- it tasted good.  The wings were alright and the fries were a mixture of soggy and burnt.  How does that happen?    We somehow lost our waitress, it was not that busy either.  No water to start with and then after that no refills.    I think next time I will just make my own adult milk shakes for a fraction of the cost.  Though thumbs up for creativity- the art work with the little piggy is cute.  I wish I could give better stars and a better review but not this time.",

    "text": "Having stayed in Vegas a few times, I always passed by this place in the Cosmo but never came in thinking it was a bit overpriced for a burger... glad I was proved wrong!  THE BURGER IS HUGE THOUGH. AND AS GOOD AS EVERYONE ELSE SAYS.  We weren't very hungry so we shared the - Gold Standard Burger - oh lord. Everything about the burger is perfect - savory, seasoned, juicy, HUGE, and perfect bread to filling ratio. The bun itself was good as well. Actually (surprisingly) it could use a little less bacon since I felt like it overtook the 'burger' flavor a bit. Me and the man shared, and we were more than full. It came with a huge portion of fries as well.  Red Velvet Shake - Using the words 'red velvet' is usually a hype thing, and I feel like I get disappointed half the time. BUT THIS SHAKE REALLY HAD THE PERFECT RED VELVET FLAVOR! It was $9 (non-alcholic) but the portion is pretty much 2 shakes so it's totally worth it (since they give you the leftover in the metal cup they blend it in - and it's about as much as in the glass cup they serve you!). The macaron on top of the shake was pretty whatever though. It was rich in red velvet flavor, and wasn't too thick or sweet.  Service was on-point, fast and friendly - and constantly checked up on us. You also get this yummy cheesey popcorn as they hand you the menus. Nommmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.",

I had the Gold Standard (Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli) and my friend had the Classic (Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Mayo, Ketchup & Pickles). Some other tempting choices on the menu include the Memphis Burger, the Big Fat Greek, and the Fun-Ghi Burger. One friend did try the Turkey Burger and thought it was a tad dry.   However, I ordered dry aged beef sirloin in a burger form, cooked medium rare, and it was perfect. It was cooked just right, it was high quality beef, it was flavored well, and the aged goat cheddar and arugula was an interesting combination. I couldn't finish the entire burger, but I certainly tried- and I barely touched my fries (which were good, although perhaps a little salty) in order to eat as much of that wonderful burger patty as I could. The sacrifice was worth it.   While the burgers were fantastic, I also ordered a mixed drink that wasn't great here (we were eating at the bar, so I was a little surprised). And it is extremely loud at night- there was a DJ in the middle of the restaurant, and it was almost impossible to hear each other speak or have a conversation. I was texting with the person I was sitting near because we kept misunderstanding each other or having to get awkwardly close to each others' ears in order to be heard. I'm not sure what time the DJ starts, and it is very likely my faulty for going to get dinner after 10pm in Vegas and expecting anything but a dance club feel :)   I would definitely come back for a burger, preferably earlier in the day when it doesn't have such a club feel, and I'd order a less complicated drink.",

One of my friends had recommended I give Holsteins a try because of their boozy adult shakes and floats. Yum, who can resist!   I gave the brown cow a try - an adult version of a root beer float with whipped cream vodka in it, yummy! For dinner I started to ask the bartender which of 3 different burgers was the best and the first I mentioned was \"the Gold Standard\" and before I could continue he said \"The Gold Standard\"! I said \"really? better than the Nom Nom Burger (with kobe beef) and he said \"yes!\". Well that made my decision pretty easy, the Gold standard it is.   Wow, what a delicious burger! I loved the combination of tomato confit, and the goat cheddar cheese, and of course bacon makes everything better! I substituted regular fries for sweet potato fries, which were so crispy and delicious I could have eaten them all night!",

    "text": "Hubs and I stayed at the Cosmo and through visa signature we were able to get a $25 food credit! We could spend our money on Secret Pizza for the umpteenth time or try something new. The decor is cool for this little place and it's SUPER convenient if you're staying there, literally off the elevators and walk like 10 steps.   We got the lobster mac and cheese which was good with chunks of lobster but really small. I would not get this again, very anti-climactic for a relatively luxurious dish and flavor was bland. The onion rings were slightly above average and I would totally eat again. Lastly got the bulgogi quesadilla and speaking as a Korean who lives in Ktown and has access to great Kfood 24/7, the quesadilla was legit AF. It got soggy and again was small portioned but oh well you're in vegas. The payment process was easy as we just charged to the room and paid the remaining balance minus $25 credit we had. For the price, none of the dishes are worth it but the least offensive dish with most value and uniqueness was the bulgogi quesadilla. Sober I might not come here but drunk? Hell yea, a good alternative to Secret Pizza.",

    "text": "Finally, a Vegas burger restaurant that puts a smile on my face.   There's a DJ in the restaurant, so if you are not here for the LOUD music - come here before 9 ~ 10 PM.  Good service and free complimentary popcorn - unfortunately, it tasted like a regular popcorn (I like kettle corn better than plain popcorn).  Truffle lobster mac n cheese (creamy Tallegio-mascarpone Sauce, with Maine lobster and black truffle - $16.5) - Wow, what an amazing appetizer. Not too creamy with a hint of lobster flavor. Definitely one of the top mac n cheese in my book.  The Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado - $17, medium rare) - I love it! I really liked the tempura-fried avocado and the Kobe beef patty. The only downside? Teriyaki sauce was a bit too strong.   Excellent burger and mac n cheese, enough said.   P.S. - It's located at 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan, right across from the Marquee Nightclub.  P.S.S. - This restaurant serves booze shakes.",

    "text": "Researching the popular items on the menu beforehand, I decided to try the Lobster Mac n Cheese, Gold Standard, and A-Chocolypse Now.   - Lobster Mac & Cheese I personally quite liked this dish, and it was a fairly decent sized appetizer, especially when shared with 2 people. I think the breading was subtle but added the texture that the dish needed. Perhaps, the cheese could've been even cheesier, as the pasta seemed to overpower it a bit.  - Gold Standard The aged beef was easily cut with my knife. That's how I usually determine whether they cook medium rare the way I like it. However, the bun was a bit tough to slice through, and that's what ultimately made my meal messy. I do believe that the size of the aged beef was overwhelming in comparison to the condiments. For example, the cheese barely covered the bread.  - A-Chocolypse Now I have an extreme obsession with chocolate and I can tell you right now that this drink was soooo good. I loved the addition of the little brownie. The server recommended that we try the shakes alcohol free, as it doesn't really do anything to change the drink's taste rather than serve as a novelty experience. My only problem with the drink was that it was so sweet, I got sick of it midway. My partner also got tired of his drink halfway so it was a waste of money. Consider sharing it with somebody.   Food alone, I would rate this burger joint in comparison to other burger places at a solid 4.  Service added, it means more towards 4 1/2 due to the fact that our waiter helped us with all our choices on the menu from the moment we sat down. We appreciated his honest, personal opinions about each item we thought about ordering. Another waiter also took our pictures for us, and man... He definitely took it facing my good angle.  This place is definitely something worth trying again. A solid burger joint!",

We made a reservation and proceeded there within the hour.  When we got there, they had our table ready as promised!   I had the Rising sun burger with the sweet potato fries.  I had mine medium rare and it was so good! I am not a big burger fan but when I taste one I really like, I rave about it.  This was surely one of the best I have ever had.  I had the Virgil rootbeer to go with it and it enhanced the gastronomic experience for me.  My hubby had the Classic burger and he said it was juicy and delicious! It came with the regular fries and it was just perfect for him! He had the Chocolate shake that totally knocked our socks off! So good!  Service was incredible.  Our servers were attentive.  There was a minute mishap but they all took care of it right away.  The Manager Ivan came by the table to check on my husband and offered apologies and even comp'd his burger even without us asking for it.  That is what excellent and attentive customer service is all about.    We most definitely be back! Thank you and kudos to Ivan and the team for a job well done!",

I had the \"fuzzy was he\" and it was really good...not too strong or sweet. We topped off our dinner with the \"campfire smore\" shake which was really good. Although it was pricey (hard to find a place on the strip that isn't), I'd eat here again.   Use the \"check in\" special to get half off a draft beer. My bf got the Franziskaner and he liked it.   The place looked a little upscale upon entering but there were people dressed up and down so just come as you are.",

Holstein also has a nice selection of beers, wine & cocktails, including their own draft lager, which I enjoyed. I thought our service was friendly, efficient & helpful.",

As well as a vegan milkshake! Both were delicious. They have some delicious, unique alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, it is right next to the chandelier so it's quite beautiful. We got to sit in the front lounge area so we didn't see the back of the restaurant. Our waitress was super nice and let us kind of chill for a while.   It wasn't too overpriced (it is vegas though). I would definitely go back.",

Started with the cheese curds which were delightfully crispy with a light batter, but we thought the cheese consistency was a bit chalky, though tasty. For the main event I chose the fun-ghi burger. Perfectly cooked thick beef patty covered in cheesy truffle goodness! A cool creamy chocolate shake rounded the meal...  Ambiance is trendy bovine club, prices were above expectation(VEGAS), and service was prompt and friendly...  My bride wants to come back for the crazy boozy shakes, and the only disappointment was the curds, so this joint doesn't make the list, but we will still be back!",

    "text": "Was looking for a quick place to eat and was recommended Holsteins. Located next to Eggslut, Holsteins is a large restaurant with tons of tables for pairs or large groups which makes for a more comfortable dining experience.  We were served their House Cajun Popcorn which was savory, well spiced and totally addicting to eat. I ordered the Rising Sun, which was the most recommended item and looked to be the most appealing based on ingredients and photos to me. We weren't quite in the mood for milkshakes this time around and found the burgers themselves were filling as is.  The Rising Sun burger consisted of a kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. I ordered the burger Medium. I would have to agree with fellow Yelper, Vivian T. and say that the burger definitely sounds better than it tasted. The components of the burger were great, but I found the beef patty to be overdone, dry and came out lukewarm. I would say if the patty itself was cooked to either a Medium Rare or Medium and came out hot, it would've been a lot better. The tempura avocado and the spicy mayo gave this burger more richness and worked well with the other components of the burger. The bun itself was substantial enough to hold everything together without being soggy or breaking apart. Ordered fries to go with my burger and they were very typical.  Service was attentive and reasonable for such a large restaurant. Decor had comical cow motifs and had plenty of lighting. Noise volume average. Price point reasonable as well, burger tasted good, just issues with temperature and doneness. Other than that, would visit in the future for a burger (if craving one) and to try out their adult milkshakes that looked absolutely delectable and sinfully good.",

I was lucky that my stomach gave me the thumbs up for Holstein's very rich, very milky, very creamy, very decadent S'mores shake. This boozy adult shake was delivered with a large toasted marshmallow on top, creamy chocolate swirls around the glass, and graham cracker coated vanilla frosting around the edge. As if that wasn't a meal in itself, I ordered the mushroom burger with a side of their perfectly crispy yet soft fries and ate my way to heaven. I gotta say, the burger was only so-so, but what wouldn't be only so-so when you start your meal with a desert-like shake.",

Smoked salmon with shallots really makes the burger.  Wife got the Gold Standard which comes with bacon and goat cheese and she said it was top notch.   Friend got the Forester burger which comes with a fried egg, but he wished he had gotten the Gold Standard instead. Regardless, he said it was still delicious.  The drinks: Third times a charm, a lovers mark, and ginger Julie. Third time's a charm was refreshing; it had mint-infused Tito's vodka and cucumber. Ginger Julie is a good one if you're into whiskey. A Lover's Mark had a punch flavor going on and came in a martini glass. Not a group favorite but apparently it's a more popular one at this joint.  Overall, this place has good food, good service, and comfortable seating. It had a bit of a Barnes and Noble ambience.",

    "text": "During our recent trip to Vegas, my wife and I were in search of the best burger on the Strip. According to Yelp Holsteins was the place to go, so we walked over to the Cosmopolitan to check it out.  Holsteins is definitely a popular game day spot. The bar had a really cool setup with lots of couches and tables in addition to the bar and plenty of TVs so that guests could enjoy all of the games. Even the staff was in the game day spirit and many sported jerseys for their favorite teams. As the Cowboys were not playing during that time, we had little interest in the football games, so we waited for a table in the main dining area.  After a short five minute wait, we were seated at a booth. Our waiter appeared just seconds later to take our drink orders and was then back to take our food orders just minutes after that. Unfortunately, that was the last we would see of him for a while. Another server delivered our food and then our server was gone for about 35-40 minutes. Not sure where he went. I wanted some ketchup but he wasn't around to ask and I had finished all of my fries by the time he reappeared. This unusual disappearance (during the lunch rush) is why I am not giving this place five stars.  On the plus side, the food and the milkshake were really outstanding. We ordered the A-chocolypse now shake which was boozy, rich, creamy, and very chocolatey. While the fudge brownie was amazing and the shake had just enough vodka for us to feel a buzz, the real MVP was the array of tiny, crunchy chocolate balls affixed to the rim of the glass with vanilla frosting. There was no way to eat the spheres without making a mess but they were so tasty that we kept eating them anyway.  To eat, we ordered the Gold Standard burger with fries. The dry-aged sirloin was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was nicely seasoned. The goat cheese and garlic chive aioli were both subtle and enhanced the taste of the burger without overpowering the beef. Overall, it was a very satisfying burger. The fries were fine although I wish I had ketchup to eat them with.  While the food was great, the service was a bit lacking and given that almost every hotel on the Strip has a burger place, I probably would give somewhere else a try next time I am in search of a great burger on the Strip.",

I tried 3 different items here which are: The Crazy Bird, Gold Standard, and the Lobster Quesadilla.   The Crazy Bird - Is your basic chicken sandwich. Sandwich isn't half-bad but nothing to say that makes this sandwich standout. Chicken is grilled!  Gold Standard - Now the patties here seem to be homemade and are humongous; however I was not a fan of it. At first bite the burger tastes really good, but the after taste of the patty tastes like beef jerky.  To me the burger tastes less and less delicious with each bite you take. I am not a fan of this place.  Lobster Quesadilla - Definitely not worth it. The portions are small and seems to like cheese and the lobster tastes whatever. Nothing great and not worth the price.  Overall I wish I just had eaten at Ramsey Burger or Shake Shack instead. Food here was definitely not to my liking. Only thing left to try here are the shakes, but not planning on returning.  Gave it a 3 stars due to the service. Food is no bueno.",

I am clearly in the minority, but I have had dozens of better hamburgers -- we found both the front of the house and the food to be \"indifferent\".   My Prime Time burger was confusing.  The medium cooked shaved prime rib made the medium rare burger underneath taste well done.  The sauce added no flavor.  When I deconstructed the burger, the prime rib was juicy but the prime Kobe patty was hard and completely tasteless. No pop of flavor and kind of hockey-puckish.  The onion rings were similarly sad.  The taste was ok,  but it was not an onion ring that had any bite at all.  It seemed like a previously frozen onion ring where the onion had that chopped texture.  Where were the rings of sweet onion dipped in a batter?  The nom-nom burger was similarly tasteless.  Overcooked at medium (we were told medium was really most restaurants medium rare) the patty was also tasteless.  The small dab of dressing did not help matters.  The cheese, however, was good.  Our server was very efficient.  The hostess, less so.  Despite reservations, we were told it would be fifteen minutes (the same as walk-ups).  When we were seated, there were at least 12 tables unoccupied . . . there had been no mass exodus.  Just indifference.  This was a very disappointing meal.",

I was whatever a combination of sick, shitfaced and sleep-absent is and got a drink with ginger beer in it that tasted fantastic and immediately made me feel worse; this I was expecting so no deductions. The in house dj had his system up far enough to interfere with those ears trying to make sense of the Bellagio fountain coordination a mile away but no matter-he was great and had enormous hair. I got a Kobe burger with chips, garlic pickles , and something red on it and it was perfect despite the waitress leering at me when I asked for it well. The french fries came in an exciting metal pail that apparently had been heated in an oven since earlier in the week, and didn't cool down prior to us leaving. We also had the mini tacos which were small but no points deducted as the menu called them effing small so whatever. The girls and their black dresses left for the Marquee Club and a petite Indian man who would welcome them into his private tent and Robert and I ordered another drink and went to find the Cosmo poker room which doesn't exist.",

Being a local, I always wanted to return here but it's such a bitch to park and navigate through City Center.  Yesterday however, I really had a craving for a Holstein's burger and took my wife there for a night out on the town.  I arrived at the host stand the girl was very friendly. She told me that the dining room wait time is about 45 minutes but there is a full menu at the bar  if we can find a seat. Well right in front of us there were 2 empty seats.   Mike at the bar, greeted us right away and reviewed the menu with us pointing out the signature burger. I had some specific requests for my burger and so did my wife. I reiterated to him to make sure that the burgers were prepared as I requested them.  Since my wife asked for her burger to be well-done, he said that the wait time for the burger would be 25 minutes.  Fifteen minutes later our burgers arrived.  They were prepared properly and Mike checked back in with us to refill our drinks and ask how things were.  The person next to me ordered a shake and I asked Mike about that drink. He described the drink and I ordered it.  The shake was delicious!! Too bad that the amount of alcohol in the shake was less than expected. I should have asked for another shot.  All in all, 2 burgers, a shake, and a soft drink cost me $66 and that included the tip.  Mike informed me that locals get 15% discount Monday through Thursday.  I will be returning here soon!",

I feel that the waitress was not very good and rip us off as she told my fiancee that her burger didn't include fries and therefore said she could have a salad which she charged us for, which she didn't say would cost more.  It clearly states that burgers come with steak or shoestring fries. I don't like to be lied to get a few more dollars on the check. FYI don't order an appetizer if you want to get your burgers quickly. At least with our server who probably forgot to enter our ticket in a timely manner making us wait 25-30 for a burger. Come on!!!

One important thing to note right up front is that the service here (and the other restaurants at the Cosmo) is top notch.  On to the burgers - they have a nice selection of burgers ranging from the traditional to not so traditional (there is one with foie gras on is - the \"Billionaire\" burger).  We had two different burgers and both were great - meat was properly cooked (they recommend medium, which you can get away with at a quality high-end burger joint like this), toppings were great, and the bun was very fresh (tiny bit too large for my taste, but not massive like at some places).  We had both fries and rings.  The only reason I gave a 4 vs 5 star rating was the fries - they were lukewarm instead of hot.  The onion rings were great.  They also have shakes (with or without booze) that were great as well.  Definitely will be back.",

There were loungy booth-like couches for small groups- would be nice to sit and have some cocktails or chat over their shakes.   We both had the \"Gold Standard\" burger.  nice flavors, i really enjoyed the aged cheddar- i was getting a little blue cheese vibe from it.

    "text": "How does a restaurant that I rated four stars and where I had one of the best burgers ever about six months ago, rate only two stars today?  Quite simply, by going downhill.  The last two times we dined here, we had issues.  The first time, I ordered a Rising Sun, done medium as usual - it arrived well done, dry and really, just tasteless.  I complained and the manager replaced it with a grass fed beef burger at no extra charge, and THIS burger was quite good actually.  If the Holstein's experience had remained as tasty, I would have updated their review at at least three stars.  However, the next time we dined, I had a billionaire burger, which, from one of my earlier experiences, I rated as one of the best burgers I had ever tasted.  This time, however, it was - meh.  It did arrive more or less medium, which was fine, but it just wasn't juicy and bursting with flavor as I recalled it from the first time I had had one here.  It just tasted ordinary, even, dried out.  Also, I ordered regular fries, and instead sweet potato fries came, which weren't even any good, dried out, cold.  I complained, and the potato fries were replaced with regular french fries, but also cold, and hard.  I complained a third time, and this time the waiter brought back some really nice, fresh fries, but of course by then I'd finished my burger, which as noted was just so-so, so I ate the fries alone with no accompaniment.  The waiter apologized, and confided that, \"things hadn't been the same lately,\" which he didn't need to tell me, but whatever has been going on, this place is pretty much not even worth going to until they get things right again.  They did not charge me for the fries and took 10% off my bill, but still, it was a disappointing experience other than the vanilla malt I had, which was fine.  I do hope they get it together and start serving the juicy bursting with flavor burgers that drew us to this place in the first place.  Until then, the images of the Carl's Jr. burger that flashed across the flat screen TV while I was at Holstein's seemed more appetizing than the $32. billionaire burger I was trying to masticate, and that, uh, makes a statement.",

My friend tried the shrimp and vegetable salad and didn't like the flavoring. She also felt ripped off as the salad has very few pieces of shrimp and those were sliced in half to make it seem as if there were more. The chicken wings were very average and not flavorful.   The plus side is the service was really good and pretty quick for a sit down place. Located on te second floor of the Cosmopolitan.",

I thought that the burger patty would be soft and moist since it's made from wagyu, but it turned out to be pretty dry. I liked the teriyaki and furikake flavors, but since the patty was so dry, I did not really like my burger. For an $18 burger that doesn't include fries, it was disappointing.  We also shared a small fry and it was more than enough for the both of us.   A couple of people from our party ordered The Forager Burger. The patty on that one is a lot more moist and soft.   The food also took forever to come out. They do give you complimentary popcorn. I asked for a refill of the bucket and our server was nice enough to oblige.   Overall, I think the burgers are super expensive and not worth the extra cost. I left wishing we had gone to Shake Shack instead.",

We all know in Vegas anything goes... strippers, unlimited partying, no sleep and buffets until you're sick. Eating healthy is out of the question. That all sounds about right to me! At Holsteins, they had a ton of shakes and I wanted them to create their coolest creation. I didn't want all the calories but sometimes you can't have everything you want in life. I was hungry when we first got down so I'm glad they provided some complimentary popcorn. I think I ate a few buckets.   My mom and I both got turkey burgers not because I was trying to be healthy but because it looked like it tasted good. I don't eat red meat so I was excited to have a juicy turkey burger.  Service was ok, definitely nothing exceptional, but it's Vegas so expectations on service aren't as high. I would definitely go back and get one of those shakes! The best part about eating here is after I'm done I can visit my favorite donut shop from across the way!",

    "text": "Stepped inside Holsteins after shopping around all the many dining options of Cosmopolitan.  Y'Can never go wrong with a burger and a beer.  Don't forget to check-in on Yelp!  There's a 50% off draft beer offer.  If it weren't for that check-in offer, I'd have gotten a shake with my buns.  After all, it's in the name! \"Holsteins Shakes & Buns\".    I'd been wanting to come in here for a long time, and to my surprise for a Friday Night, it was not that busy.  A lot of the other establishments were filled with the pre-partiers in their collared shirts, dresses, and high heels as they wait for Marquee Nightclub to open.  If you're one of those pre-partiers, Holsteins has a casual lounge area with a bar and small dining area near the entrance.  I opted for the other, more comfortable area with the cute cow artwork everywhere.  Looking over the menu, they have a ton of dishes to choose from but one grabbed my attention and it was then I had to look no further: Foie Gras.  The \"Billionaire Burger\" consists of American Wagyu beef, foie gras, and truffle mayo! and at 32 bucks, it was go big or go home.  Oh yeah, and that 50% off draft beer, I went for a signature selection, the Holsteins Lager which is brewed locally by Tenaya Creek.  The Billionaire has arrived and it was so damn good.  I don't always expect a casino burger spot to be all that great but this one didn't disappoint.  The buttery flavor of the truffle mayo is unforgettable, I can practically taste it as I write this review.  At a medium rare cook, the ground wagyu beef was solid to perfection.  After I devoured it, I almost wanted to lick the plate up but there were people around.... F*%# it!  I did it anyway.  Dunno what took me so long to try this place but it is definitely deserved for a repeat return visit but next time I'll save space in my belly for the shake as well.",

Solid service and setup (loved the tv screens in there and the bench-like tables facing them as soon as you walk in- great for couples!), and lots of photos opps, that's for sure.  Drinks are delicious including their \"Bam-Boozled\" shakes which are a must (they seem to rotate selections as well!) and are sure to trigger smiles and laughs for the bargain price of $15. Share one with a friend like I did (Donutella which came complete with a donut on top)...hell, share a bunch of things. We split a burger, shake, and a couple of sides and were stuffed. Drinks were good there too (yes, it was a dinner of gluttony).  In summary, bar food heaven for those who are into it. I can never resist some serious onion rings which of course they have, but when I was with a larger group once, we shared a bunch of their apps including the fried cheese curds which sounds kind of disgusting and I would never have thought to try...but were actually pretty damn tasty! Does anyone even bother with the salad selection here? If you're headed to Holstein's, you know what you're in for!",

I would definitely order it again.   You also receive a free small tub of seasoned popcorn before the food arrives and I loved it. It tasted like a Cajun seasoning. We ordered a side of small fries with our entree and they were delicious as well. Service was also quick and the waitress was kind. I would recommend this place if you're in the Cosmo!",

After a slightly cold reception from the hostess, we did not have high expectations. However, after tasting the Donutella shake (complete with donut holes on top and encrusted with hazelnuts), we were blown away! This milkshake had bold flavor and was such a unique blend of chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut. You can definitely taste the alcohol in it as well. We both ordered the Rising Sun burger which was perfectly cooked (medium) and delicious. Only negative was that they were out of the suggested beer pairing. Highly recommend!",

I ordered the quinoa salad ($11) (which is a great price) after reading good reviews on it. The restaurant was busy. I felt a little weird getting looks from staff members probably because I was alone... yes I go out eat often alone because I'm single and I don't cook and I don't want take out all the time. The lady that served me was very friendly. It took a while for it to come out but it was busy so normal.  The quinoa salad was really good. Cauliflower in it, crispy asparagus, cranberries and delicious vegetable chips! With the vinaigrette it was really good. Yet I felt it was missing something and that might have been my mistake: if I added on a protein this would have been perfection. I wasn't very hungry so didn't have any ad on and I should have regarding to flavor of this salad. I took the rest to go and walked home happy is I had leftovers and a very affordable dinner at the Cosmopolitan!:)",

We walked over from our place to the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas where this place was.  As with anything in Vegas it is always busy but we were seated pretty quick.  Options sounded really good.  Unfortunately we were not very hungry so we ended up just getting a dip.  The buffalo chicken dip was very good.  Just the right amount of heat, tender chicken and creamy texture.    They give you popcorn as a munchy. It was so good !! We asked for more which I am sure many people do.    The drink list is very good and are made really well.    I wish we could have made it back for a burger.  They looked really good.  Next time !",

    "text": "We ordered the onion rings, buffalo wings and garlic parmesan fries to share and each ordered a different burger.   The appetisers were good, my personal favourite was the onion rings. The garlic parmesan was a bit too garlic-y for my taste but the rest of our party really enjoyed them. The portions are quite large so keep that in mind when ordering.  The burgers were quite good. None of us found a specific burger that called out to us so we each customised our orders. That being said, it appears that they change the menu regularly so I would be interested in visiting again to see what new additions there are to the menu.   My biggest issue wasn't with the food but with how loud the place was. Saying its pretty loud is an understatement. We had the misfortune of being seated next to separate tables with large groups of guys who, we are convinced, were in a testosterone fuelled competition to see who could be the loudest. It was too loud, even by Vegas standards (there was legit banging on the tables and howl-adjacent screams). We are all here to have a good time but these guys had no respect for the customers around them and the staff didn't do anything, that we saw, to get them to quiet down.",

It is so deliciously sinful and packed with the punch.   Frozen grasshopper - great if you like mint! I really enjoyed the flavor although you can taste the alcohol shot in this.  Cookies and creme - served with a giant ice cream sandwich (who says you cant have dessert before dinner??) and super sweet and delicious. This drink is dangerous since you can barely taste the alcohol in it.  We had the gold standard and the rising sun burger, both delicious and cooked to perfection with a medium rare patty. Portions were definitely on the larger side, considering we finished our shakes so we were struggling to finish our burger. No regrets though! Definitely a satisfying meal :D",

All their burgers are on the pricier side but their Billionaire Burger is even more expensive costing $15 above their Classic burger. However, the idea of having Foie Gras and Wagyu Beef together is just too good to pass up. I was pleasantly pleased with the combination and could really taste the Foie Gras. The truffle mayo was another added touch. I thought the size was good and I really enjoyed the burger. In addition I got a Banana Split milk shake which really tasted like a Banana split. It was a nice pairing to the burger. I think all in all, it's a fun place to eat at in The Cosmopolitan and although on the pricier side, the food is good.",

It was a fun vibe, big tables and not too loud. The menu had a lot of options, but it's not too overwhelming. I picked the Forager Burger and the Garlic Parmesan fries. The burger was amazing but the winner of my meal was the fries. I didn't take a picture of them because we were too busy chowing down on them. But the garlic was so fresh and OMG, I'm dreaming about them now. The serving was large enough for four people and we had a ton of leftover (wish I could have brought them home with me!) My friends also ordered the lamb meatballs (they said they were awesome), cauliflower and the Caesar salad.   Our server, Dean, was also super awesome and patient. He was attentive and helpful and made great suggestions! Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely stay at the Cosmo and visit Holstein's again!",

They seem to be giving customers a smaller amount of milkshake for the same $15 price. Not sure if the glass is more narrow but they no longer give you the silver tin blender cup with the rest of your shake and my glass was only filled half way (the other half was all whipped cream)  Coming twice a year to toast birthdays & anniversaries was a tradition for me & my husband for a few years now. We were disappointed to find they no longer sing Happy Birthday & give nitrogen fluff balls tonight when we came in. We are glad to have experienced Holsteins under the previous management - now it's time to find a new place for a truly exceptional shake experience now that the magic is gone",

We left Holsteins far too full - fat and happy for sure. El Machete was amazing, spicy, but not too spicy cooked perfectly medium. Juicy, big, heaven to eat. I want another! I was so wrapped up in my burger I don't even remember what Jeff had, but he devoured his just as quickly as I ate mine. We have already agreed another trip needs to be made back to Vegas just so we can eat at Holsteins. Although it would be easier if thery would just open up a location in Dallas, or anywhere in the near vicinity.",

Not our bartender. The keg needed to be changed about 1/4 of way into pour of my glass. Does he say, \"we are changing the keg, and your beer will be out in a minute, would you like some water while you wait?\" Nope. He continues to pour foam into the glass and let it settle, squeezing out every ounce from the keg. Finally, he tops the last 1/4 of my beer with new beer, grabs a straw, and stirs the beer, hoping I won't notice. 10 minutes later I get a bottom of keg soured beer with no head. He says, \"I'll take it off the bill because of the wait.\" I couldn't even drink the beer it was so off tasting. Needless to say, won't be back. The food isn't good enough. In Vegas, I'd rather go somewhere with better service and food. Too many great options to settle for mediocre.",

    "text": "Every time I try to come here, the wait is always ridiculous.  I never remember to make reservations either cause, well, it's a burger place!  Finally, this past weekend around 2pm, after a somewhat \"short\" wait of 40 minutes, I got to try Holsteins.  It actually took the 4 of us awhile to look through the menu, and in the end, I went with the Gold Standard, which is a burger with dry aged beef sirloin burger, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula & garlic-chive aioli.  I ordered it medium rare and came with a nice pink middle.  What really caught my attention about the Gold Standard was the dry aged beef, since dry aging beef condenses the beef flavor, and wow that burger was juicy.  Out of all 4 burgers, mine was the only one that had juices dripping down my fingers, even versus the Kobe beef burgers!  The toppings were all great, especially the aged goat cheddar.  You can tell it's a little different than your normal cheddar.  The garlic-chive aioli has a mellow garlic taste.  Besides hoping the bacon was a little bit crispier, the Gold Standard is really a burger that's up there in the burger world.  It's just a very tasty burger and I can see why it is so popular!  I also tried a bit of the Rising Sun, as well as the Korean Bull-gogi.  The Rising Sun is more of an Asian fusion burger, with teriyaki glaze and a tempura avocado that sits on top of the burger.  It also has a Kobe beef patty, so the whole burger had this velvety smooth texture thanks to the fatty patty and the smooth creamy avocado!  I would like a bit more teriyaki sauce though.  As for the Korean Bull-gogi burger, the patty is marinated to give it extra flavor.  The best part is definitely the fried egg that sits on top.  Who can resist the egg yolk just running all over the kimchi slaw and the beef patty??  Out of all the fries, I liked the steak cut fries the most.  Crunchy exterior with a creamy potato center.  Onion rings were great as well.  The shoestring fries were a little stale to me.  Now, with shakes as part of its name, we knew we had to try a few of their shakes and ended up getting the Black Cow Float and the Frozen Grasshopper.  Black Cow Float is a fun and somewhat nostalgic shake since it is more like a coke flat with the ice cream rather than a True shake.  It even comes with pop rocks!  The Frozen Grasshopper is a must for any mint chocolate fans.  Smooth creamy minty frozen goodness.  For both shakes, we could taste the alcohol but it was pretty well masked!  They also have a bunch of beers on draft.  The Bosteels Triple Karmeliet is a good one!  Price-wise, it is pricey.  Our burgers were around $18, with shakes at $11.  The price should reflect great service but I found the service a bit lacking.  Our waitress only came to check on us twice and it took awhile to get her attention for the check as well.  After our meal, I can see why so many people like the burgers at Holsteins.  Can't wait till the next time to try our other burgers!",

    "text": "Good service, good staff, good ambiance, sub par burgers.   We ate here last night (Sept 2015) and our burgers were really unimpressive. I ordered the Billionaire Burger, which is their priciest burger (double the price of the others) the Kobe beef patty i ordered medium rare but it was really dry and unimpressive, seemed like bland ground beef. My girlfriend ordered the Nom Nom which is also Kobe Beef, her's was cooked pink (as mine should have been) but was still pretty dry & unimpressive overall. I probably should have sent back my burger since it was clearly overcooked, but we were with another couple and I hate to be the guy who sends back food and then my food comes out like 15 min after everyone is already done eating.   As a note, I still ate the entire burger, it wasn't inedible at all. My sentiment is when you're paying $32 for a hamburger you'd hope they'd nail it and impress. Maybe I had too high hopes for the restaurant after hearing that it was better than Umami Burger.   Fries and onion rings were great, as were our beers, and our server was very nice & attentive. And actually the lobster truffle mac & cheese wasn't amazing either. Really those burgers were the real issue, if it's a burger restaurant that's a major flaw.",

Holsteins is certainly not cheap, and you can definitely make some catastrophic decisions given their large menu- so here is some guidance on what you should get  Bam Boozled Shakes- Not a huge fan of booze-cream but some of these are pretty spectacular  Birthday cake- yea it pretty much tastes like a birthday cake   Cereal bowl- captain crunch FTW  Black Cow- even comes with pop rocks on top  Not great Drunken monkey- sounds great in theory, but in practice is pretty awful  Creme Brule- custard and booze do not mix   Red Velvet- bleh  Big Buns  Meat ball burger- some purists would probably not like this but it is delicious- it has a tasty focacia bun and pesto on it  Gold Standard- Bacon, Goat cheese, Garlic aoli- this is definitely not for the faint of heart- but those man enough to stare death from heart disease in the face will be rewarded with sensuous delights.   Rising Sun- tempura avocado. Thats fried avacado. If you aren't already ordering this burger as we speak I don't know what else to say to you.  What to Avoid Nom Nom- this is pretty meh. Kobe beef should be so good it stands on its own (you are paying enough for that anyway)- but here it is covered in potato chips and 1000 island dressing- a dissapointment  California Turkey- if you are trying to eat healthy this probably isn't the place for you but even the veggie burger is better than this",

We had a couple of drinks at The Chandelier Bar directly across the way.  It was our wedding anniversary and we were out with a couple of friends.  We decided to go with Holsteins instead of China Poblano based on Yelp reviews.  As we left the bar the music in the area went from background dance music for the night club on the other side of the room, to deafening.  We were greeted by the hostess who offered to seat us once we finished our drinks from the other bar.  That didn't sit so well with members of our group.  We walked around and debated skipping and going across the road to any of the dozens of places to eat, but my lazy kicked in and we decided to give it ago.  Back to Holsteins, sans our cocktails, greeted by the same hostess.  I mentioned it was a bummer of a policy, to which she stated don't shoot the messenger.  Again, almost sent my friends into a tailspin, but we trudged on!  Once seated, the music got louder. So loud we had to literally yell across the table to each other.  At this point we were all ready to leave, until Sam greeted us.  He was so genuine and polite, I felt bad for him having to work right then!    We expressed the fact we were deciding to stay or go.  He completely understood and even offered to mention it to his manager, knowing full well nothing could be done.  We stuck it out.... The food was average.  We got 4 different full sized burgers and fries; classic, gold standard, el caliente, and the rising sun (mine).  I'm on a burger mission this year, obviously, and I love teriyaki.  The meat was cooked properly and the bun wasn't soggy (all bonuses) but with all the other options out there, this place was underwhelming, especially with the other outside influences.  I'd say skip it.",

    "text": "Holsteins or Gordon Ramsay BurGR. Although close, I still vote for BurGR simply because Holsteins is a good $5 more expensive per burger with comparable quality in my opinion. My friend begs to differ but this is my review.  Drinks here are overpriced and very average, so I wouldn't recommend spending your money on them.  Burgers range from like $18-20 on average, and it's a very average sized patty, maybe 1/3lb. They are cooked well though, as you would expect.   As everyone says, I tried the Gold Standard burger with an egg and I finished that in like 2 minutes.  One thing for this place is that the place is pretty big and the we didn't have to wait very long, compared to a 30-45min wait at BurGR. Either way, I'd suggest coming here to try it if you haven't, since it's a decent place. As for me, I'd come back here only if I'm destroying the tables at Cosmo or literally have no time to eat elsewhere, otherwise I'd probably go to the Cosmo Buffet instead.",

I got a chicken burger with fries. everything was good but nothing spectacular...if I had a choice from this place and red robins id chose red robins...which tells you a lot. when i get to vegas i expect amazingness---mediocre at BEST  luckily one of us had a ton of credits to use on food or id have been bummed.",

I went with the Gold Standard adding fried egg. It was pretty good. Their Lobster Mac and Cheese is the best truffled mac n cheese I've ever had, better than the ones at those expensive steakhouses. So kudos for that.  We added triple malt to our chocolate shake but was still underwhelmed. I thought steak fries was a great idea, but by the time they came, I couldn't even eat a stick of it because of all the grease I had been consuming.   I would have given a 4-star because I thought it wasn't bad at all, but my whole group of 3 felt sick and heavy for 2 days because of all the grease... so I guess we won't be coming back here on our next visit to Cosmo.",

Staff was courteous and after a bit of a wait (it was a Saturday night) we were seated. The atmosphere is very unique, I liked the theme, the decor, and the artwork, however morbid it may be (one picture is of an animated cow who has cut his own heart out, and admiring how delicious it looks). But overall a fun experience.  We ordered the Holstein Beef sliders and some sweet potato fries, as well as their Campfire Smores shake. The sliders were great, the beef in particular was awesome, I'd love to go back for one of their 8oz. full size burgers. The fries were my favorite, I've had several from all around, and I think these were the best sweet potato fries I've had yet. The shake was also very very good, and I recommend that if you're trying the full experience, to order a shake with your meal. It tasted exactly as described, with graham cracker bits mixed throughout.  Great food, good service, and a fun atmosphere with lots of people, music playing; an overall great time.",

My sister got a Bloody Mary and I had the Thai beef salad. Wow! Both were amazing. The bartenders were really busy and very attentive. One of the female bartenders didn't look like she was in a good mood but the Barback and the other bartender were welcoming and made conversation for a bit despite how busy they were. I loved how the staff seemed very young! I like a place who hires the young and gives them a chance to prove themselves.

We also ordered the Pork Belly Bun which was crispy on the outside but was swimming in too much hoisen sauce. Since it was one of my friend's birthday so we decided to order the un-birthday birthday cake. It look greak in the picture but was dense and  flavorless.

I thought it was average, but I can't put my finger on what I thought it was lacking.  Maybe pickles?  Either way, given the quality of the burger this isn't a place I'd go on my own, but a place I would go as a compromise to eat with my carnivorous counterparts.

Good flavor otherwise. In past visits I was much more satisfied,so I still consider this a very good spot ( especially those spiked shakes !! )",

After waiting over 30 minutes (yes, we clocked it) and trying to get anyone's attention, it turns out there was only one guy making shakes for the whole restaurant, or it was broken, take your pick.

My husband and I shared an appetizer (Cuban' street taco) which the bartender recommended and it was delicious, nothing I had ever had b4. Pulled pork with smoked ham in a tiny hard taco shell with beans and pickles on the side. We also shared the gold standard burger. The sirloin patty was amazing but as a whole I think the burger itself could have been more flavorful. Adding ketchup and mustard didn't quite set  it off by giving it more \"flavor\" but overall I did enjoy the burger. The only downside to this was the fries! I'm a fries kinda girl when having a burger and the fries was such a disappointment. It was soggy so obviously they gave us old fries that have been sitting for awhile. Although the burger lacked a bit of flavor if the fries would have been fresh and hot i would have given this place a 5 star.",

We sat in the bar area/lounge and were told to order from the bar. When I tried to order he ignored us. Then I asked if we order from him and he said yes but to wait. So we waited about 5 min and then he tells us were gonna have to order from a server so we should talk to one of them. Say what??  Luckily, the server was really helpful and took care of us. A few minutes later I heard the guy barking at one of the servers - grumpo!!  Cool place but I had a burger at BurGR that was better. I'd go back for another try and maybe a shake.

Explained what was popular/what he recommended -their sweet potato fries were heavenly (order them as a side! They come in a bigger tin)  -they had boozy shakes that looked absolutely delicious. If I wasn't so stuffed already, I would've totally ordered one.   Cons -there was a wait for a table (we came at 930pm) so we just found a spot at the bar  Highly recommend this place!",

I had a black cherry soda that was really tasty.  We also had some fries and fried pickles.  I prefer pickle chips as the spears were a bit hard to eat.  You really had to cut each bite instead of just biting the pickle spear.   The fries were tasty too.  I want to try their burgers another time.",

It may easily be the best shake I've ever had. I tried both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions and they're all works of art. The shakes are a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for, both in terms of quantity and taste. A gigantic shake may not be for everyone, but if you're looking for a quick/casual meal in Vegas that won't break the bank, you should definitely consider getting a solid burger and amazing shake here.",

People constantly got their food before me and  finished their food before I got mine, and I ordered  5 mins before they did. I tipped 18% and I am very polite so not sure why they would delay my food. Maybe because I used the free draft beer from Yelp when you checkin. So fair warning you may not want to use the free beer discount. But don't know why they offer that if they don't want people using it.  Anyways two stars for good burger",

This was AMAZING. I'm Chinese, meaning I'm used to eating Peking Duck at every single big family dinner, so my palette for this dish is highly refined. But shoooot this crispy pork belly is a delicious rendition of the Peking Duck...dare I say even BETTER than the OG dish??  + The pork belly is PERFECTLY cooked. Crispy on the outside (a little bit of burnt so you can taste the smokiness!), and extremely tender inside. + Fresh cilantro and herb complements, with jalapenos on the side for those non-spicy eaters! + Hoisin sauce is a must! XOXO + LOVED the buns! Although it was thick, it complemented all the ingredients and didn't leave you feeling that you just ate too much dough + It was NOT dripping with oil!!! I'm in Vegas, so I don't want to feel more bloated from anything else (except from the alcohol of course), and surprisingly, this didn't make me feel disgusting afterwards! + The best part?

But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.  The beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.  I can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?  Hai, The Rising Sun.  Arigato Holsteins!!!",

The ambiance surely is nice, as you would expect in one of the new city center hotels.  The waiters are friendly and accommodating.  The burgers were delish, though I wouldn't say they were anything beyond what you would expect from a $20 burger kind of place.  The thing that makes me want to come back are the shakes.  As people have said before, the variety of innovative flavors they have here is phenomenal but can be daunting.  Get everyone in your group to get a different one so you can try out lots of flavors!  I had a s'mores one that was incredible!  Not to mention the presentation of the shakes is a pleasure to the eyes and tastebuds.  The marshmallow garnish I think was a homemade marshmallow and was delicious.  They do have booze in them, but only enough for taste.  They can't really induce or maintain a buzz, so order a drink on the side if needed.  Is it lame that I wanna take a trip Las Vegas just to get another Holstein's shake?  Well, I'm not ashamed to admit it, so get over it!",

Okay okay - I am getting ahead of myself..let's start at the beginning.  I came here with a co-worker and we decided to get a bunch of plates to share. We had the following (listed in order by favorite):  1-Lobster Mac & Cheese - Lump chunks of lobster in a decant creamy mac and cheese sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  2 - Pizza Twinkie - mozzarella cheese and pepperoni in a twinkie type of dough - deep fried with tomato dipping sauce. Grown up pizza rolls - Yum!  3 - Fried Pickles - Nothing more to say - they speak for themselves.  4 - Lobster Filet Tiny Bun - Two tiny burgers that are made with filet mignon and topped with lobster.   5 - Blue Cheese Kettle Chips with French Onion Dip - These were a bit average. Would not get these again. I could have bough the chip and made the onion dip at home for the same or less price.  We then moved on to the best part...the HUGE milk shakes ( I couldn't even finish it and I love me some ice cream :-) Try to Oreo or Pumpkin - Out of this world delicious!!",

    "text": "A bit of yelp research led us to have a late lunch at Holsteins during our trip, and we were definitely not disappointed.  It was a Monday afternoon, around 2pm, so it wasn't too busy. We chose to sit in the lounge and I was surprised that our service was much better than foursquare told me it would be - our waitress was quick with menus and water, and our food came out of the kitchen at a pretty standard speed.  We started with a Drunken Monkey and a Black Cow. My bf is notoriously picky about milkshakes, and claims that the Monkey is the best milkshake he's ever had. I doubled checked because that seemed like a big claim for him, but he stood by it. Both shakes were really delicious, and my Black Cow didn't seem too boozy, but it must've had plenty of that cherry vodka, because I could taste cherry pretty well. The menu seems to have been adjusted from the one on their website, I think a few of the shakes were different but not the ones we wanted, so it didn't really bother me.  We also ordered the pizza twinkies - it was either that or fried pickles, but we can get those everywhere in Florida, so we went with what would be more unique. They were really yummy, and the marinara dipping sauce was also delicious.  Burger-wise, I had the Rising Sun and the bf had the Gold Standard, both cooked medium. The Rising Sun did not disappoint from the rave reviews online - their teriyaki sauce was freakishly delicious,  and the spicy mayo was just the right amount of spicy (the two mixed together were amaaaazing on my fries). The avocado was a little unwieldy, and I would have preferred a few thin slices. I didn't think the avocado needed to be tempura'd, either, but I guess I get the appeal.  The Gold Standard was almost completely devoured by the time I got a bite, so I guess he enjoyed it. Both the shoestring and the steak fries were awesome, I couldn't stop eating either of them. Super crispy and delicious.  I can't think of any reason to give Holsteins less than 5 stars besides the price (a bit high for burgers but honestly reasonable for the Strip) and the fact that there isn't one in Orlando.",

The bill (comes with gratuity for 6 people) with a little extra was $114.  GOOD: + Food: Everything was tasty, juicy, flavorful, delicious. Everything looked beautiful as well, and the table comes with (instead of a basket of bread) a bucket of bbq popcorn. How fun! It was a great non-filling munching snack too (because you'll definitely want to save room for the delicious food). + Atmosphere: Very energetic, fun, a little colorful with a life-size hot pink cow statue... and very warm.  A good place to come with a group of people. + Service: Our server, Chaz, was super nice and shared a great story of how he was carded even though he's a super-tall guy.  He was quick, friendly, and very attentive.  Also, other servers we didn't know came by and picked up the empty plates fairly quickly.  BAD: - Price: I would come here to try it once, which I did and I am glad I got to taste such a high-end delicious burger! But, really, a $16-$20 burger is craziness. Worth trying, once or twice! But craziness.  This is not a place for the kids (unless you're ready to spend more) because they probably won't even appreciate the high-quality burgers--I was a kid once, and honestly, a burger's a burger when I was little!! (And if you're not willing to spend a bit more at this joint, they'll probably go hungry.)  OVERALL: I really enjoyed my experience here, and I'd come back if I felt like splurging.",

They are thick and juicy and the milkshakes are awesome. All of the shakes come with some little candies sprinkled on top and they are so good. I got the skinny fries with my burger and I was not disappointed. If you are in Vegas you must take the time to go try this place. I promise you will love it.",

This was our first time at Holstein's and we would repeat.  Service was good and very efficient.  Food was pretty good but the scene was very fun and energetic.  We started with the Cuban Street Tacos and Bucket of Wings.  Both were okay.  The wings were a little bland and very dry.  Personally I think the street tacos would've tasted better with soft tortillas, but they were pretty good.    We ordered the Steakhouse, El Machete, and Mac & Cheese for our meal and all were tasty.  Good quality product and healthy portions.  We only ate half of each burger and took the other half home.    The highlight of the meal was their milkshakes.  Great thick shakes that the kids loved!!    Overall a solid experience at Holsteins.",

    "text": "After the less than underwhelming lunch we had the day before at Bobby Flays Mesa Grill, I was reluctant to do burgers again but I'm so very glad I did. Holsteins does right everything that Bobby Flay's does wrong. The service was attentive, upbeat, got our order correct and the food was SPOT ON! I enjoyed the Candy Cane boozy shake which was very yummy and almost a meal in itself...but the winner was the burger. I had the Gold Standard burger and it definitely lived up to its name. Perfectly cooked to medium; bacon had a good bite to it, not too much lettuce and tomato so that it complimented instead of overwhelmed the burger. The aioli was super yum too. The seasoning on the burger enhanced the meat but the star was the meat itself. The burger was tender, juicy, and was as it should be if you were making it on your own grill at home. I had the shoestring fries which were clearly hand cut and cooked to order. They were crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. My husband had the Nom-Nom burger. He initially took the chips off the burger but put them back on when he saw how much they complimented his burger and added the perfect crunch. He orders his burgers well done and the waitress didn't even flinch as some often do. It was done perfectly...and still had that juiciness that a good burger should have without the redness. We will absolutely be back to try more yummy goodness at Holsteins. Thank you for renewing my confidence that there CAN be upscale burgers that are truly done right.",

Sliders or as they call them Tiny Buns- The Holstein Beef which on menu says pickle, ketchup and mustard...that would be one pickle, one drop of mustard and one drop of ketchup and day old bread... OUCH...someone in the kitchen staff needs to sneak over to First Food and Bar at the Palazzo and learn something about sliders...I actually laughed when I opened it up to see what was between the buns....One star...  That said my friend loved everything that had foie gras -\"street tacos\" and \"duck, duck, goose\" (a burger)....Five stars  Roughly three stars...I am sure they will make some corrections on the food and I will definitely be back....",

They have three different bartenders and I waited probably 15 minutes before my husband and I just walked out. The sad part is they are not even busy and these people just clean wine glasses, take in receipts but never want to take an order??      My husband asked one women if she was able to change the channel to a specific game, her reply was to give him the dirtiest look and tell him something like it was not a job she was able to do at this time. It was beyond rude and I guess this really made her not want to take our order. My husband who is always pretty nice to all women had to stoop to her level and ask if she could find someone who can change the channel then. 15 minutes after zero acknowledgment we walked out.             As we walk out we were glad the business was slow enough to tell both managers Ryan & Ryan how bad the staff behind the bar was. I would refer to them as bartenders but they don't seem to want to do that job.",

The sweet potato fries were sweet potato fries. The bartender suggested I try a banana bread beer, which I opted in on without considering the price - $14 NOT worth it at all, didn't notice the price until I got the bill at the end. I'd rather have a nice glass of wine. Next time, I know to ask before just agreeing. Seriously, that beer was almost as much as my $17.5 burger. Service was good, food came out quick.

    "text": "We ate dinner our first night at Holsteins. Everyone had a $15 hamburger, except for one of us who had a $16 chicken sandwich. Our 11 year old son wanted a milkshake with dinner, but we told him we would get it for him later that night, when we returned to the room. On the way out we saw that the restaurant sign on the front said \"Open 4 pm to 12 am\", precisely what it says on their website, so we made our plans accordingly.       We walked around the Strip, saw some sights, and rode the Ferris Wheel. We notice the time was 11:45pm, and all of us hurry as fast as we can from the Ferris Wheel back to the restaurant in 10 minutes- an impressive feat by all accounts. So we get there at 11:55pm, and before we can order a milkshake, the hostess coldly informs us that they are closed. I explain to her that the sign says they close at 12am, it is 11:55pm, we made it all the way from the Ferris wheel in 10 minutes to buy our 11 year old a $10 vanilla milkshake to go, but she didn't care. She told us again, without looking up from the register, that they are closed.   This place could have sold a vanilla milkshake to an 11 yr old if they wanted, but they didn't want to.       The food we had here was good, but obviously overpriced. They just don't care, and that was our experience at this hotel throughout our stay.  It is a pretty hotel, but they just don't care.  There are too many choices in Vegas to get a $15 hamburger without coming to a place that just doesn't care.  Clay F Henderson, NV Guest on 3/20/16",

It's an experience in itself and a good spot for everyone - groups of girls, guys, families, singles, etc.  CALIFORNIA TURKEY with steakcut fries ($14.50) - Highly Recommend! This burger is absolutely delicious, nourishing (not greasy) and unique. The alfalfa sprouts especially added some magical delicious flair that just made it to die for! I'm totally craving one right now and would order it again in a heartbeat! Portions are big, so a g/f and I shared this and we were both full.

Since i had to go back to work - no drinkie - had some root beer called rat bastard ( $5 ) - ok   order kettle chips ( $6 )   Gold Standard Burger ( $17 - add $2 more for onion rings )   Cool looking place, in the mall area of the Cosmo - place was hopping today.  Guy next to me seated 3-4 minutes after me - he gets his malt and sliders before i get my chips and/or burger....in fact, i never get my chips - the bartender didn't  hear me .....okaaay.  The burger - asked for it medium - it was juicy but no hint of pink at all ...none ... since the burger was juicy i can live with it.  My guess a quarter pounder, but not sure - overall, i liked it - the goat cheddar complimented the meat, lil micro greens were a nice touch and  bacon was all good  but $17 .... not sure about the pricing.    Onion rings were also decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  Will i try again ?  yeaaah - i want to try some of the sausages they apparently make in house.  A pet peeve - they make mention of everything made in house yet what do they bring me when i get the plate of food - bottled catsup and mustard ( i believe heinz and french's ) - geez guys, can't you make it yourself ?  or at least put the stuff in a fancy container ?   At least they didn't pull a kgb and when i ask for mayo they throw me a few \"to go\" tear open mayo containers .  pics will be posted later today",

Unfortunately, it was a little late for all of us to eat dinner, so we opted to pass up the shakes...Still a little bummed that we didn't get to try one of those sinful looking concoctions. We did order three different burgers and a salad- everything was delicious! I ordered the Gold Standard and enjoyed every bite...Such a delicious combination of beef, bacon, cheese, and arugula. My hubby ordered the Rising Sun and then our friend ordered the regular burger with bacon. I had regular French fries and they were definitely better than average. And oh! The popcorn they give you at the beginning as an appetizer was addicting (I'd have eaten the entire bucket myself). Everyone was happy all around. Our waiter was attentive and the atmosphere was comfortable. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone craving a good burger while in Vegas!",

    "text": "Well good thing I'm writing this review cause I am SO DAMN FULL that I can't sleep!! First of all, this place is REALLY LOUD. So be warned that if you are going there to converse with others...I wouldn't suggest coming here. Don't get me wrong, I love that the DJ had tons of enthusiasm but the volume of the music was just too loud.   Our server was Jonathan, who seemed to be a really cool guy when he first introduced us. I personally felt really rushed to order our drinks. This is where the first problem arose...we wanted a plain vanilla milkshake and his snarky response was that \"all the shakes have vanilla\" so after we place our order for an oreo milkshake, we see on the menu that they have plain vanilla, chocolate, and other standard flavors. When we saw this we obviously confronted us and told him we just wanted the vanilla. He said that \"the order was already placed and as he was bringing us our other drinks he was literally blending it\" I'm not sure about you folks but when you are in the food and beverage industry, shouldn't you be attentive to the customers needs? Not sure if he was purposely trying to get a higher check average since the standard milkshakes were $3 less but anyways. I thought this was extremely rude of him to say that the milkshake was already being blended so we couldn't change our order when he wouldn't let us order what we wanted in the first place. The milkshake was yummy, but the principle.  When we asked about other menu alternatives he laughed and said \"you know this is a burger place right?\" Well excuse me...but if I remember correctly the right side of the menu had quesadillas, tacos, and a variety of other things. Who would have known it was such a crime to ask such a question.  Another thing that really tickled me was that during the meal, the fire alarm went off and NOBODY was evacuating. Yes, we probably should have taken it a little more seriously and at least gotten up to check what was going on but is it just me or is it illegal for them to not even make an effort to evacuate us while a fire alarm is going off?  We ordered the chicken wings to start and I had the Longhorn burger  for my main; and although it was extremely tasty, I didn't think it was anything to write home about (except the steak fries, yum) Ultimately, I would have to agree with my fellow Yelpers that the service here is extremely slow, with just average food. I think next time I'll have to make the drive to Bachi Burger.  The reason for my two star rating -1 star for a snarky server -1 star for not bringing us popcorn -1 star because the food was just OK",

It does sit in a convenient location, since it's across from Marquee's entrance.  I guess it might just be that I've had more than enough of my share of burgers the past week, but the classic burger didn't have any real stand out flavor to it.  The steak fries were okay, but not much different from something  you'd get from Red Robin.   The only thing that got me interested in the place was their selection of beers. I actually spent more time deciding on what beer I wanted to drink the on what I wanted to eat, probably if I spent more time on deciding what to eat I might've enjoyed it more.  Anyway I ordered the Red Fox Stout, and it had someone of a similar taste to Guiness but with interesting flavors of what seemed similar to wine.  From the other reviews, it's seems like the place has better things to offer, so it's possible that I'd give this place a shot again. But there are other great restaurants in the area, so I wouldn't force myself to eat here if I couldn't decide on anything to eat.",

    "text": "Good burgers are easy enough to find. But GREAT burgers are treasures that you sometimes have to look for. If you want a great burger in Vegas, then look no further, because Holsteins is it!   The burgers are made with the finest ingredients, are thick and juicy and are cooked to perfection. They're also a bit eclectic. While you can get a basic cheeseburger is you're a boring guy who has given up on life, I highly recommend that you try one of the more unique selections. My wife and I split a \"Rising Sun\" and a \"Gold Standard\" burger. Both were excellent. The onion rings were also amazing. They were giant and the breading was nothing short of spectacular. If you're looking for an adult (i.e. alcoholic) milkshake, try the \"Fat Boy,\" which contains pretzels, chocolate/Carmel popcorn, Reese's, and vodka. It was'nt too strong, but it was DELICIOUS!   The only downside is that this place is expensive, but when you're eating at good restaurants in Vegas, what place isn't expensive? I suppose the best way to spin it is that you get what you pay for.   Highly recommended! Two thumbs up (and some toes too... It's that good!).",

    "text": "Came here for a quick bite to eat on my first night in town. I googled \"Best Burger in Vegas\" and tried to pick the best combination of highly rated and near my hotel. I was not disappointed with my selection.  Holsteins has a pretty solid beer selection. There were probably a dozen beers on tap, and they had a decent bottle list as well with selections ranging from the standard (Budweiser) to the slightly fancier (Chimay Blue). I read a lot about the milkshakes, but it sounded like too much paired with a burger, so I opted out.  I got the Nom Nom burger and added avocado. It came out a perfect medium rare (as requested). I was considering The Rising Sun but wanted something a little less complicated. The burger itself was tender and well-seasoned. The bun was soft and buttery (how I like them). All-in-all, it was melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Very rich and flavorful. I got onion rings instead of fries, and they were pretty good as well but nothing special.  Some of the more negative reviews on here might have to do with price, and while I also am reluctant to spend $18 on a cheeseburger, it's Vegas and should be expected. I also shouldn't be paying $8 for a Weihenstephaner when it's usually $10 a 6 pack...  Holsteins gets a 5/5 for delivering as advertised. A damn good burger.",

    "text": "The alcoholic milk shakes are something that should be tried here. Sure, they cost about as much as an entree, but these shakes are probably the highlight of each meal I get here.  Burgers are overpriced for what they are. I'd go for the more obscure sounding burgers instead of the more traditional fare. You will not be impressed by the standard burgers (i.e. Gold Standard), since they will taste very familiar at a premium price. Try something like the Rising Sun or the Korean Bulgogi burger; both very good. These burgers always remind me why I love cows so much.  Do not order the chicken & waffle. All you get is one waffle and snack-bar quality chicken fingers with it. Very disappointed on that one. It was like something I could get at a bowling alley. Some of the other appetizers look interesting though (lobster corn dogs). The sausages also look like something I need to try on a future visit.  Holstein's is definitely a place to check out. Place has a great vibe and atmosphere, with enough twist to keep me coming back for more.",

This was before autogratuity for large groups was done away with, and I honestly feel like our waitress knew she was getting the tip anyway so she did the bare minimum...If that.  She threw a fit when we asked for a manager and insisted that it's impossible for them to change the autograt amount.  The manager actually took the autograt off entirely, and we gave about 75% of the tip we left to the bussers who took care of our table that night.

    "text": "First off, I only review burgers.  I tried their sister burger place (LBS in the Red Rock Casino) and that was a pretty solid burger.  I came here with only the intention of critiquing their burger.  I was thinking of getting the billionaire burger since foie gras is now illegal in Cali, but couldn't bring myself to fork out $30 for a burger.  I was going to go with the nom nom burger, but my waiter sold me on the Gold Standard which he said was voted the best burger in Las Vegas.  How could I not try it now?  It came out pretty fast.  It did not look messy and presentation was done well.  The burger itself was above average and I give it a solid 4 stars.  However, I disagree that it is the best burger in Las Vegas and definitely disagree with the $17 price tag.  So if you're curious, to try, you will be getting a good tasting high quality burger, but you're going to pay for it.  I liked it, but I think it's a one and done for me.  WHAT I ORDERED: Main --- The Gold Standard: 4/5  Sides --- Shoestring Fries: 3/5 a tad too salty  STAFF: Good  WAIT TIME: None.  Went on a Tuesday around 1pm  PORTION: Average  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK: Way too expensive.  The burger was good, but not worth the price.  WOULD I RETURN: Probably not.  If I was at the Cosmopolitan, I'd rather have Secret Pizza",

(I highly recommend doing this, especially at a place like Holsteins where their menus are endless)   For milkshakes, we were able to try the basic Strawberry and the alcohol infused Grasshopper.  I would definitely recommend trying at least one of the specialty alcohol milkshake.  The Grasshopper was definitely a hit among my friends.  Unfortunately for those who love tasting the danger in drinks, the alcohol amount is very light and you'll enjoy the unique mixture of sweet tastes rather than the intoxication.    Like how the past reviewers mentioned, the burgers are a bit on the expensive side.  Each burger meal does come with a pint size-like bucket of fries but it's not worth puffing your stomach if you're planning to squeeze into a dress 2 hours later.   I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Bun under their \"Tiny Buns\" section.  Loved it.  Go for any appetizer items for your meal.  The size was more than enough.  My friends were eyeing my meal the most and I was the only one without a burger.    With burgers, the \"Rising Sun\" is a must.  Kobe beef drizzled with nori furikake and crispy yam in between? Yeah you want that.",

    "text": "We stopped by Holsteins for dinner hoping that it would be a more casual and faster dining experience than some of the other options in the area. Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but there are very few fast casual dining options near the City Center that don't involve sandwiches or hot dogs.   Anyway, it was a Tuesday night. Even though place was pretty dead, service was spotty. Our server wasn't super friendly, but she got the job done. Our food came out pretty quickly.   I ordered the Urth Burger, which is their vegan burger. It was fine. The patty was thick and moist. My only complaint is that the burger itself was a bit dry. It was supposed to come with avocado, but there was only a light green schmear on one of the buns.   The boy ordered the traditional burger. He seemed to love it. He pretty much devoured the whole thing.   Both the orders came with fries. He got the natural cut fries and I ordered the sweet potato fries. When the fries first came out, there were cold and soggy. We sent them back to the kitchen and got a new batch.   His natural cut fries were way better than the sweet potato fries. My sweet potato fries were cut too thin, so most of the fries were overcooked and burnt.   Prices are typical of places in Vegas. For our two burgers and a shake, we spent nearly $40, not including tip.   If this place were back in Austin, I'd probably never go again, but since it's Vegas, I guess it gets a pass.",

Later that night, I started feeling dizzy and disoriented so I excused myself to my room. What ensued was 12+ hours of severe food poisoning. I have never experienced such terrible food poisoning in my life. I finally had to go to the ER the next day because I'm from out of town and I had to check out of the hotel. I could barely get up from the bathroom floor.  So yeah. Basically the worst food related experience of my life.",

I tried the Nom Nom Burger and the Buttermilk Onion Rings and just let me say \"YUMMY\" does not give it justice. Delish to the 10th degree! My hubby, who does not like onion rings, loved the Buttermilk Onion Rings here. He ate over half of them. They are crunchy, crispy and the batter stays on! The aioli dip was good but I like the ranch dressing better.  The Nom Nom Burger was incredible! It was juicy and thick and delish. It came with fries which were crisy and perfect. I recommend this restaurant to anyone I know who is going to Vegas.",

The burgers here are big, juicy and loaded with all kinds of various tasty toppings.   We had the Gold Standard Burger and a Rising Sun Burger and both were delicious.  (I would bet that the other choices on the menu are just as good!)  I asked for mine as rare as they could make it and they did that to perfection.  We didn't have room for dessert, so we ordered it anyway!  The 'Cow Pie', recommended by our server, was actually a small chocolate cake sitting on marshmallow and a crisp graham cracker, sort of like a Super-S'more.  Easily shared by two people, it satisfied the chocolate craving I had, at least for that day! On top of the good food, the service was friendly and helpful, the bar is cool and you are surrounded by the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel, so what's not to like?   Tip: If you are parking in the garage take the East Side Garage Elevator to the top and you are right there!",

    "text": "Tried Holsteins Shakes and Buns while staying at the Cosmo this week.   I think if I rate the restaurant on my standard scale of taste, ambience and a memorable experience, I'd say that the milkshakes are certainly memorable. Specifically their tiramisu shake with a shot of petron. Quite delicious and presentation is excellent. This is a restaurant that understands that they need to stand out and not just do the same boring shakes. Really impressed really overall with their attempts to be creative. The burgers are also inventive and creative.   The ambience works for what they are trying to achieve, which is a more casual bar-type setting with TVs and comfortable places to sit. Designed really more like a late night place after a night of drinking and clubbing (or maybe before). So on that note I'm fine with the ambience. It works for this type of place.   I think my only major disappointment (not a complaint really) is that the burgers just aren't that special. They look special and the sound special but when you actually eat them, they are just \"meh\". Not earth shattering. Maybe I'm of the mindset that the best burgers focus on the meat and the preparation and then are minimal beyond that. Sometimes when you put too much on a sandwich (even high end ingredients), it can actually lessen the burger.   Anyway, the burgers are good but nothing I'd go back to eat. Same on the fries. I'd suggest they really try to transform the sides a bit more. I WOULD go back for the shakes though.",

A short way into our burgers (Longhorn burger for me with brisket, cole slaw and pickles; a mushroom and gruyere burger for David) we said, wow, these are possibly better than any place except Umami burger. As the meal went on, we decided Holsteins was giving even the venerable Umami hatch green chili burger a run for its money. It was that good. I got the Longhorn burger because I love BBQ, even though I thought the idea of brisket on a burger was silly. It wasn't. The brisket was sliced thin, and was a bit crisp - almost like a super delicious bacon. And best of all, the BBQ sauce was not cloyingly sweet. A minor criticism, I thought the cole slaw disappeared and the pickles were too dominant - maybe the quantities need adjusting. David was similarly pleased with his burger, every ingredient was distinct and very tasty especially the mushrooms. One of us got fries and the other onion rings, both were good. Service was first rate. We didn't try the shakes. We were very impressed.",

I didn't order a burger but, I had a bite of my friend's Kobe burger? It's ginormous and juicy, medium rare. I had a lobster sandwich, something lobster. It was yummmmy, sweeet and chewy lobster :) I was hung the fuck over at 12PM so definitely not in the mood for a giant burger. Cute, friendly service : )",

    "text": "I was in town for a convention so I just grabbed a seat at the bar. It was pretty busy, but the bartenders were all pretty friendly.   I started with the fried green tomato salad. I think it was my favorite part of the meal. It was 3 slices of tomato fried with some mixed greens. It was pretty tasty, though it was $14 for a smallish starter.   The hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. I am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through the bottom bun and makes the burger fall apart. Then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. Never good.   Anyway, the hen house was tasty. They seem to skimp on the fries though. They were tasty, but the cup of fries you get seems a little small.   As for drinks, they have quite a few wines and craft beers available, which was nice.   Two glasses of wine ($20), a salad and burger was $55.",

I also had some kind of bulgogi quesadilla which was interesting (pass).  The other burgers our table ordered were good too. Perfectly cooked, great buns, and everyone left very full.  The french fries and sweet potato fries were shoestring (yum). They have yummy sounding spiked milkshakes, but I didn't have the stomach to try it. They have a full bar - which I'd imagine would be great to hang out at.   Prices are reasonable. Service was fine.",

Partly because I was starved and partly because it was good. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, but it was no big deal. The Chandelier is right across the way and they call you when you're table is ready. So, we went and had a drink at the Chandelier. The place is pretty big and there is plenty of tables and booths. They have a bar you can sit at and tv's which was good for all of the guys watching March Madness. Also, the menu is pretty extensive if you like burgers. We absolutely had to try one of the spiked shakes. I got the Drunken Monkey. Soooooo good. I drank it before my burger even made it out. It was delicious! I ordered the classic burger and sweet potato fries. I literally ate it all. I am not a huge burger person. To me a burger is a burger. But this was pretty good and the fries were delicious. Yes! Loved it.",

It is just like it sounds, a delicious shake full of booze. The shake was so large that it made almost 2 whole shakes so I shared it with my sister. I will absolutely be back on my next visit.

    "text": "I stopped by this place after a cross country flight to try one thing and one thing only: the Philly Cheese Steak Spring Rolls. I've heard a few regular Vegas visitors rave about them. So I was on a quest to find out just how special they could possibly be.   Located inside the new and hip Cosmopolitan, Holstein's contains a bar area as well as a fair amount of table seating. Grabbing a quick lunch before a meeting, I headed towards a bar space where I noticed the server cleaning up after someone who had just left. After I sat down, another server came up to me and said \"Oh no, sir, there's someone sitting there and he'll be right back.\"  Looking at the clear space, I asked \"Then why did they just clear all his stuff away?\"  Before he could answer, I moved farther down the bar and picked another spot. During the rest of my visit, that \"man\" never came back to his \"spot.\" No apologies or anything. So that was a little rude.    I spied the rolls on the menu and ordered them. When they arrived I knew right away that these were not your average spring rolls. They were quite large. And very good, too. Just picture the best Philly cheese steak you ever had all wrapped up into a perfectly fried spring roll. Then triple that in size. Now you have it.   They were outstanding and I'll be back again someday for more. They are also very filling, even though they're on the appetizer menu. So you could easily make this a meal.   This place has a little to learn about customer service, but the food lives up to expectations. And after you're done, step outside to your left and get your shoes shined. It's totally worth it. Just trust me.",

Not a lot of options with sides.  I like sweet potato fries as an alternative to regular fries but they didn't offer that.  I ordered their onion rings just to try.  I was there with friends at around 1030-11pm.  There was loud music which I thought was coming from Marquee but was actually an in-house DJ.  It was very loud but I enjoyed it.  Like a real club atmosphere with burgers.  Someone from the kitchen came out and told me that they were out of onion rings which was disappointing so I just got regular fries.  My sister ordered their pecan turtle shake at the recommendation of the waitress and it was sooooooo GOOD.  I tried some and thought this was the best shake I've ever had...so delicious.  I decided after I got my burger (which took a decent amount of time to come to the table) that I would order another shake because it tasted so good.  The waitress told me that I couldn't order because the kitchen just closed.  That was understandable. Most times the waitress would ask if you wanted to order anything else before the kitchen closed but this was a missed opportunity.  Two stars off because I believe this was the reason that I didn't get onion rings...probably because they had already closed their fryer and didn't or couldn't fire it up.  I've worked in a kitchen and I know how these things go.  As an employee I understand and as a customer I'm disappointed.  Still, the milkshakes are enough to come back.",

The server was incredibly helpful, I liked the way the menu was explained especially how every burger option on the menu can be customized. As someone who doesn't go for a huge amount of toppings on a burger this was much appreciated. The burgers themselves were great, really good quality beef which tasted great.

Our server was extremely accommodating especially since we had such a large group and it wasn't that crowded for being a Saturday night around 9 pm.   There is a large selection of hand crafted cocktails, and beer selection - lots of people in my group were pleasantly surprised to see lots of smaller (local to San Diego) brews on their list.  Definitely check this place out if you need a break from the fancy restaurants :)",

    "text": "The colorful graffiti art is a little in-your-face & is so trendy, it'll be out of style by the time I post this review, but it fits just right into The Cosmopolitan.   Glamourous-sounding burgers, shakes with a shot of alkie (because last night's bender was not enough) & fashionable items like pork belly & lobster rolls...it's so been there, done that. The menu is so unapologetically predictable but I can't say I'm disappointed.   Our meal before flying home consisted of: -- 'bam-boozled shake' brown cow ($11): whipped cream vodka, root beer, vanilla ice cream & pop rocks. Reason for 4-star rating. -- black & white shake ($8): comes with an extra tumbler. Yummy!  -- fried chicken fingers & waffles ($11): horrid! I've had better at Denny's. Everyone's got their version of this comfort-food fave, but please do it right.  -- 'tiny buns' Maine lobster roll ($16.50 for 2): the chive aioli overpowered the dish. Loved the cute, tiny hot dog buns.  -- 'tiny buns' pork belly bun ($9 for 2): I wanted to try, but after bf showed me the sheer amount of fat, I couldn't do it. Yes, animal fat scares me. (sidenote: BF prefers chairman bao.)   Four stars because I love the idea of 'tiny buns,' & because I want to try every single alcoholic shake on the menu. Like I said, predictably trendy, but it's got me interested.",

Because I am a glutton (and because you only live once), I ordered the Billionaire Burger-kobe beef, foie gras, onion marmalade and truffle mayo.  Yes, its $32 but seriously, it's Vegas, live it up and enjoy.  The burger is big, rich, and truly decadent.  For some texture freaks, it's a pretty soft sandwich so be warned.  Nothing is on it to really add a crisp bite.  The spot is also great to people watch as it across from the Marquee night club.",

We were seated with orders taken in just 15 minutes. Now here is where the slow horrendous service starts, thanks alot Cyrus! Tic toc... Tic toc... 35 minutes pass by! Oh my, it has just dawned on him that he's forgotten to put in our order. Another 20 minutes has elapsed until we finally receive our order. No apologies for the hour long wait during this not so busy time of the day, he must gave given up on that party of 5 tip. Another 10 minutes for condiments and by this time we have all inhaled our food. Now comes time for the check, so not exaggerating the 15 minutes it took him to itemize the bill and return with receipts! During this time, he practically avoided eye contact while doing laps around our table. WTH?!  Cyrus needs to take a course or two in proper serving etiquette. There was absolutely no communication or courtesy on his part, which could have saved for the negative experience. Fortunately for Holstein's, the food is on point and the decor is just too cute saving them an a-OK review!",

    "text": "LOVE this place.  Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!    Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..  You can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Holstein's was one of the first restaurants that my husband and I tried in Las Vegas and at the time, I remember being absolutely wow'ed. Unfortunately, after living in the city for a few years and trying a lot of wonderful food that this city has to offer, we returned for a visit and I was less than impressed.   Previously their burgers came sans fries and there were a few different fries that were offered. We tried truffle fries (I think...) and I was excited to try them again when we returned last night! Unfortunately now the fries come on the side of your burger, and they don't offer anything other than regular, sweet potato and onion rings (which are just some lamely pedestrian offerings for a burger place on the strip). I tried the regular fries with my burger and was pretty unimpressed. In my opinion, if you are serving 15$ burgers you better be offering some pretty amazing fries to go with them. Sadly, this was not the case.  I tried the Nom Nom burger and it was really good. The meat was actually cooked the medium rare that I asked for, which I always appreciate. The cheddar was good, the 1000 island was a nice flavor, and the chips were fantastic. I would have much rather preferred a side of the chips (which tasted like they may have been made in house?) rather than the fries that I got with my burger! The burger was huge, while the portion of fries wasn't insane, the size of the burger was! I couldn't even finish half of the burger.   If you check in and order a burger they give you a free 12 oz of their house lager, which wasn't spectacular, but it's always nice to get something free for a yelp check in! It looked like they had a few rotating taps with craft brews, and they had a nice selection of bottled beer to offer! I really liked looking at their hard cider offerings, they even had a few that I hadn't tried before!  The service was very good, and it was incredibly fast. It was almost too fast, we probably could have sat and chatted a bit more. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, though.  The only reason I would be back would be to try one of their boozy shake flavors - they looked very interesting, and I'm bummed that I was too full to try one!",

Its location in the Cosmo should indicate that it's got an artsy feel to it; there are fun pop art paintings that advertise the meaty fare you can order. I got the Asian inspired burger and found it super tasty and a very sizable and satisfying portion. Gonna give a shout-out to the fries as well; they were salty and crispy with a perfect amount of tenderness in the core. Service was a little slow and I would've liked getting drinks then apps then food, instead of booze coming basically last. Oh well.",

After looking at this ridiculously priced menu, we ordered a classic burger and the steakhouse burger. Both burgers are massive and tough. On the classic burger, the bread was hard. The $2 cheese that was put on the burger was so thin, she couldnt taste it... On the steakhouse burger, the bread was hard, the marmalade onions were really sweet. I scraped off the onions and I could still taste the onions. There was SO much black pepper on the burger that it was overwhelming. I would never recommend anyone to come here. For $15-32 burgers... this place is overpriced and overrated. I'm not happy AT ALL. The best things on the menu are the popcorn and the water.",

The whole staff was so grateful and our food was so so delicious. I begged our server Fallon to please charge us for something so that I could give her a tip because we had no cash. She said \"no, I appreciate you all so much\" and began to cry, so I dropped it. The food was wonderful, your associates were wonderful and it's unfortunate I ate there under very sad circumstances (massacre 10/1), but I am very grateful for the generosity of your team.

    "text": "I am obsessed with burgers, so whenever I travel, I always am on the look out for the best burger in town.  Based on many recommendations, I decided to try Holstein's.  Sadly, Holstein's was another over hyped place for me.  I got the rising sun - the burger with avocado tempura, sweet potato shavings, and a teriyaki-like sauce. I tend to stay away from Asian fusion stuff, but this burger seemed to be quite popular per my friends and Yelp.    The burger was decent, but I had a few problems with it.  1) The avocado tempura was tiny - it only covered about half of the patty, so I only was able to taste avocado with half of my burger.  2) The patty is pretty flimsy.  Not meaty enough for me.  Definitely overcooked for medium rare.  3) The bun was nothing to write home about.  In a perfect burger, the bun adds texture, balance, and cohesion.  But, in this burger, it  didn't add any of that for me.  I wish that the bun were warmer or better toasted.  4) The fries were not good.  They came with the burger, so I'm glad that I didn't need to pay extra or else I would have been more disappointed.  They were not crisp enough, so I actually left some of them behind.  Anyone who knows me knows that I never leave fries behind.    All in all, the taste of the burger was fine, but definitely overpriced for what you get.  This is to be expected as we are talking about a meal on the Strip.  I have had far more delicious burgers in LA.  I was definitely not impressed with the service either.  A little too pretentious for  my taste.",

BAMBOOZLED MILKSHAKES BRINGING THIS GIRL TO THEIR YARD! Now I'm not a huge drinker because I'm so light weight I can barely handle one drink, but I do think it's fun, and I also have the biggest sweet tooth ever, so naturally everything about this just made sense and resonated within me. Its the perfect drink for someone with a low tolerance and 24/7 sugar craving like me! Every shake sounded amazing and I had a hard time choosing so I told our server to choose for me, while my friend Borys ordered a side of sweet potatoe fries. Shortly after, the server placed this giant beautiful diabetes in a glass cup of  unregrettable goodness in front of me. I went with the monkey and it was beyond my imagination. Those sweet potatoe fries served with their natural  housemade ketchup came in super clutch cause I needed a little something salty to balance out all this sweetness!",

Skip this place and go elsewhere (Shake Shack, In-n-Out) for a real burger.",

    "text": "The Burger that changed my life... It's here. ITS HERE!!!  It wasn't enough that I had the best burger of my life here, it had to change my whole thought process on burgers. I mean how gourmet can you make a burger? You can only do so much to elevate a burger, what can you possibly do?   Well let me introduce you to the \"Rising Sun\" -Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furiki, crispy yam, and a tempura avocado and don't forgot the egg, its part of of every perfect burger.  The Kobe beef has so much flavor. The beef is delicious and sweet, but not overpowering.  I loved the touch with tempura avocado because I've never seen nor heard of it, but its good!  The crispy yam makes a play with the avocado to give your burger the crispy texture along with the nori. Then the egg to top it off to make a monster burger even more messy. All these components together create a sweet and savory party in your mouth. How can I enjoy a burger so much and not cry that bacon isn't apart of it?  I'm beyond impressed at this point. The day before I was at Ramsays Burger thinking I had a good burger. There is no competition for this burger heaven, hands down.   Everyone one knows the perfect combo with a burger and fry is a shake! And we're in vegas so why not some alcohol!? Can I get a \"RED VELVET CAKE SHAKE\"? This shake is on point and a great way to cool off and get Turnt!(Drunk) and ready for Marquee! Vodka is hard to pair with desserts, if its too strong it just destroys.  Well It isn't strong but you'll know it was there later. The shake finishes off nicely with a mini whoopie pie on top.   The prices are good too, gourmet burgers with the gourmet price! Excellent service!  If you're on the strip and you want a Good Ass Burger, then get to the Cosmo! It's just necessary to have a perfect trip to Vegas.",

There was also a special burger being offered along with a shake, however I chose the Fun-Ghi burger, which came with a side of fries. The food was well portioned, so much so I was only able to eat about half. Service was great and we did not have to wait to be seated, although the dining area was not enormous so I could see there being a wait. They were not able to accommodate reservations either.",

HS&B did not disappoint. The burger joint is located on the 2nd level, just take the escalator up and go left. We arrived for dinner @ 7 pm,  and were greeted by an attractive receptionist. She said their was no wait, to our surprise, and promptly led us to our table. Our waiter (heavy eastern European accent), took our drink orders. I tried a microbrew of some sort (nondescript pale ale). Boris explained the menu, and I settled on the Hen burger. It was a burger with a fried egg and bacon. Incredible! Loved the meat and egg combination. I was told that the restaurant has an onsite butcher. Fries were shoestring type and very tasty. We didn't order one of the alcoholic shakes, but the couple sitting next to us did, and it looked good. They even provide the extra shake in the metal container it is made in. I noticed that the manager was smart enough to hire young, pretty ladies and outfit them in short red dresses... Well done good sir! Nice touch! The tab for two w/o desert was $48 plus tip.  Great night, great food, will definitely return.",

If this is a mediocre burger, please tell me where I can find a real gourmet burger. Holsteins is great. Bottom line. Had a Kobe burger with bacon and cheese, cooked perfectly. Everything was fresh and delicious including their home made ketchup which is the best I've ever had. To the person complaining about the waitress not cutting your burger in half... That is why they give YOU a knife. By the way, it took me all but 3 second to do it myself. The vanilla shake, no alcohol, was unreal. Has little vanilla malt balls I think which add great texture. It's not cheap, and service is hit or miss(which is why 4 out of 5)but none of that matters once you bite into one of these burgers. Like I said earlier, please don't pay attn to the very few who have eatin in n out (a decent burger) and red robin (ok for a chain) there entire life and compare everything to that. There is no comparison.",

    "text": "Holsteins is probably the most mismanaged restaurant I have ever been to.  Typically, when I go to Vegas, I like to have at least one meal that isn't quite as formal (and we typically pick something fun like Burger Bar, BLT Burger, Pink Taco, etc).  This time we decided to try Holsteins mostly because the Cosmopolitan is such a nice hotel.  Unfortunately Holsteins wasn't up to par with the service level in the rest of the hotel.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food and they got the order wrong.  They corrected the food part but never gave us our drinks.  About halfway through our meal, the waitress informed us that they weren't making the drink my wife ordered that night (very strange) and they still hadn't got my strawberry milkshake.  We finished our meal and one of the managers came by to clear our plates.  He asked how our meal was and I informed him that I still hadn't gotten my strawberry shake (had mentioned it to the waitress when she was by earlier).  It finally arrived about 15 minutes later (in fairness, the manager did apologize and took the shake off our bill).  We noticed 2 other tables complaining also about the time it was taking to get their food.  All throughout this process they typically had 6 people on the floor (2 cocktail servers in bright red dresses who the bus boys were just hanging around and flirting with, a couple of hostesses...one that was just standing in the middle of the floor and doing nothing, and a couple of managers that weren't doing much of anything).  Although they couldn't just go to the back and flip burgers, my thought process throughout was that they should have had less front end people and more in the kitchen.  If this is typical of this restaurant, we will just frequent the other burger restaurants the next time we're in town Honestly, they're a dime a dozen in Vegas and the service at the other places I mentioned is far superior to Holsteins.",

We each ordered an adult shake... I got the apple pie shake and she got the mint chocolate shake (grasshopper). Both were absolutely delicious and you can definitely taste the alcohol! I can't wait to go back and try all the other shakes on the menu as we had a tough time deciding on these two. We ordered 3 of the sliders (beef, pork belly, and veggie burger) as well as the lobster truffle mac n cheese. The food is AMAZING! The lobster mac n cheese comes with a bite size lobster BLT which was fantastic and they do not skimp on the lobster in the mac n cheese! The \"Urth\" (veggie) slider was my favorite but the other two were also delicious and perfectly cooked. Service was great, the staff was friendly and our food came out fast. The only bummer is that I live in LA and can't eat here as often as I would like. The new Cosmopolitan hotel is beautiful and I can't recommend visiting it and Holsteins the next time you're in Vegas! I will certainly be back!",

Couple things worth noting:   1) check in on yelp and you can get a free beer.   2) when you get here, they give you a small thing of Cajun cheese / spiced popcorn which is highly addictive.   I went with the Fun-ghi burger, which really was just all around satisfying. Nice flavors of mushrooms with a hint of truffle, juicy patty cooked perfectly, and a well balanced and assembled burger. Slightly expensive for a burger at just shy of $20, but as with most every other review, this is what you can expect for the strip.   If you are looking for an informal tasty bite and are craving a burger, this place will satisfy your cravings.",

It might seem like a dumb thing to point out, but as a city girl, I just called those cows, cows and never knew them as Holsteins LOL   Anyway! I really enjoyed this place and I would totally come again -- even as much as I hate driving to the strip. I came here for lunch with a party of 10. We agreed to have lunch at 12 PM PST and while we did have to wait for the table to be prepped as our party arrived, I don't believe it was a long wait at all.   For starters, we were brought small tin cans of PIZZA FLAVORED popcorn. So tasty and the presentation was very cute. My end of the table all ordered beer and because we checked in we were able to get our drinks (select beers) for 50% off!! I got a Modelo Especial, normally $10.00, for $4.50. I am unsure if all their beers are $10.00.   I decided to order The Rising Sun Burger. I wanted something that I wouldn't be able to find else where. I was able to order my burger without the tempura avocado for allergy reasons. Aside from the avocado, it it made with Kobe beef and has a teriyaki glaze, fried yams and nori. My burger was perfectl medium rare and my bun was buttery, but not too buttery. The fries are also super amazing here!!!!! 11/10 recommend. And for fellow ranch lovers, this place has quality ranch if you ask for a side!!",

We also had onion rings on the side, I thought they were very good: crispy and just the right amount of batter. Next time I will just go for the onion rings instead of fries.  The bam-boozled shakes, which are basically spiked shakes, were very good too. I had a grasshopper shake: the shake itself was yummy and all the toppings took it to the next level.

It means that you'll probably have to wait a bit to be seated, a meal here is going to cost a grip, and you may be surrounded by that \"Vegas Baby\" crowd.   It would be very easy to hate on Holstein's.  But I understand what to expect on the strip in regards to the wait times and prices.  Besides, no one forced me to come here.  All that being said, the burgers here are pretty good and only quality beef is served here.  I got the Gold Standard on my first visit and amazed with the thickness, the juiciness, and taste.  It's basically a quality steak in a bun.  I recently got the Nom Nom Burger and it was good too, but lacked the thickness/size of the Gold Standard.  One things for sure, I'll be having the Gold Standard the next time I come back.  I can't even tell you how good or bad the desserts are because I don't have a sweet tooth and honestly, I just don't remember.  But I suggest that you try them because Holstein's is also known for their desserts.    2017 Yelp Review #53",

You can reach it straight from the East Tower parking structure.   You have the option of dining at their bar or small lounge area with full menu or sitting in their dining room. It can quite busy sometimes so don't be surprised by a wait.   Their menu isn't all burgers and fries. There's a wide selection of apps and milkshakes! They're also known for their fun \"adult\" aka alcoholic milkshakes. These shakes are no joke! I saw one that has an entire ice cream cookie dipped into the milkshake! I've tried the birthday cake one and it was quite tasty but very very filling (and I can't help but cringe at the number of calories with each milky sip)!  As for burgers I've honestly only gotten one thing, the Rising Sun. Kobe beef patty with tempura avocado and sweet potato shavings. YUMMMMM it also comes with a side of fries which you can upgrade for $2.50 to onion rings or sweet potato fries.   I've wanted to try the other burgers but why stray from something I already know I love?!",

    "text": "Oh man the sugar rush you will have after drinking the fantastic shakes!!  Came by in the afternoon on a Teusday to a somewhat empty restaurant. We sat at the lounge and ordered the cookies & cream and A-chocalypse shakes, both of which are boozy shakes.  Our waitress Ashley was super sweet, friendly and attentive, yay!  We only ordered the two shakes and the restaurant across the dining area and lounge only had 3 groups . .  . yet it took 20 minutes to get our shake while all the staff just stood around. It would have been a five star review if not for the unexpected and really unnecessary wait time.  anywho, the shakes came and OMG! These are MASSIVE! And so extravagant! (see pics!)  The A-Chocolypse Now shake was our less favorite of the two shakes. chocolate vodka with oreos, chocolate sauce, topped with a brownie, chocolate pocky stick, hershey bars, and the glass was coated in vanilla frosting and chocolate crunchies. The shake wasnt as boozy as the other, and not that chocolatey which we were hoping for. Very sweet, the brownie was decent, but overall nothing exciting.  The cookie & cream on the other hand killed it! That is where the four star review comes from! whipped cream vodka infused in the shake, mixed with chocolate chip and oreo cookies, topped with a GIANT Ice cream sandwich, coated in vanilla frosting and cookies! This was very boozy, yet blended well with the shake, not too sweet, amazing flavor, the cookies offered a nice change in texture with the crunch, the ice cream sandwich was good but the entire thing was frozen - seems they freeze them all ahead and don't thaw out, so it was kind of a bummer. Overall, the favorite of the two!  Both shakes came with an additional cup/glass/whatever the metal container is called with the \"leftover\" shake that did not fit in the main shake glass. For $15 each, you definitely get what you pay for!",

Too much bun, not enough ahi, or vice versa and the buns were a big stale  The funghi burger was ok but the taste was not to my liking. I ate half.   The s'mores shake was over promised. Pure sugar and too much other stuff. It's a thing but not for me",

Though a bit dry for a medium done Gold Standard,  it was good. I didn't have fries bc i made an assumption. I have never in 45 plus years of ordering in a restaurant had a burger without at least the offer of fries. We ended up with popcorn.  So basically you get a Six Dollar burger, probably a 1/2lb for $23. glass of house wine, $12. Service was decent for a packed house. I guess eating in Vegas is a privilege.  One more meal, breakfast and we're gone for good. I'll eat in another town if I have to come through here again.",

But since it come with fries I guess it's worth? Nahhh. This will probably be the last time I come here unless I get their 32 dollar Kobe beef burger. But other than that nothing impressed me enough to come back and I'd rather try new restaurants in Vegas.  Forget to mention their fries were on point ! It was crispy and had little crispy flakes on them as well that made it even more crunchier and delicious. I'd probably get a fries to go.",

The fries here were terrible, stale and under-seasoned.  The steak in the Thai steak salad I had was tough and mostly flavorless as well. The only saving grace was that the vegetables were fresh and the salad dressing was excellent.   The service was good. Food takes a while to get out, but it was pretty busy so I didn't care.",

The service was quick (which is always nice when on a time crunch) and the food was good. Once you sit down they serve popcorn which I thought was an interesting and unique offering. I am not sure what the flavor was but I was quite tasty!  I got the Urth Burger with a side of fries. The burger was pretty messy and fell apart while eating but it had great flavor. Anything with avocado on it and I'm sold!   I have had better vegan burgers and there are plenty of burger choices on the strip I would recommend over Holsteins. Great place to end your night of drinking!",

Holsteins is known for burgers and shakes but they have other options food, all American inspired. I wasn't feeling a burger but I was feeling their macaroni and cheese. Lobster mac and cheese to be exact.  It was so so good. It came out hot, cheese was oozing from the dish, and the lobster. There was actually a fair amount of lobster which I loved! Awesome dish. Service was really good throughout our meal. We were even comped a dessert (it helps to be all girls on a bachelorette party). Our server came out with macaroons that were made with dry ice. I can't explain it but it was really good.",

Our waiter, Tiffanie, was adorable and had a great energy. She recommended the Bob's Tea cocktail so I tried it. I was a little nervous as I don't love tequila, but don't hate it either. I'm so glad I listened to her, because it was perfect! Refreshing, a little fruity, and ends with a kick from the jalapeno. My second was spicier and stronger, so it definitely varies.   For the meal, I split the truffle lobster macaroni and cheese as a starter. It was delicious!! Less fishy than other lobster pasta dishes I've had before, and the perfect size to split between two people, since it's definitely rich. I followed that up with the The Rising Sun burger with a vegan patty. The teriyaki glaze was so flavorful, but not too much, and I loved the light tempura fried avocado. It was a perfect combination! Unfortunately I didn't have any appetite when it was time for dessert, I was too full from everything else. I definitely want to come back for a boozey milkshake soon!!",

Which has two of their shakes: Drunkin Monkey (alcoholic or non alcoholic) and Vanilla (non alcoholic).   DRINKS:  Drunkin monkey was AMAZING! An extra shot in it is $3. I didn't get it but my friend did and it was delicious. They too the shake off with a piece of banana dipped in chocolate and a good sized chunk of chocolate on top. Vanilla shake gets white chocolate on top.   FOOD:  Late Night menu is basically snacks but they also offer two of the burgers which are not listed. Regular cheese burger and a bacon cheeseburger. The cheeseburger was good. Meat was cooked well to my liking and it was pretty big. I couldn't finish it. Also tried their \"Poutine\" it's French fries topped with shredded beef, cheese, and gravy on the side! Very good but you have to dig around for the cheese. Still amazing though   ATMOSPHERE:  Since we got there at 12 the dining area was closed so it was just the bar which does offer first come seating. There's about 30 spots at the bar and around 7 tables behind it. They had a dj who was right behind us so it was a bit loud but it's Vegas so what do you expect. The service was great our server (can't remember her name but blonde tall and skinny) VERY sweet. She updated us on our food while we waited and was on top of refills. She's fantastic!  Overall great experience. I have 4 stars instead of 5 because it didn't say on Yelp that they close restaurant and give different menu at 12.",

    "text": "I completely happened upon this spot by chance. I had been wandering around in some labyrinthine mall full of ritzy stores I couldn't imagine shopping in, when I saw the sign for Holstein's Shakes and Buns? Sounds like a winning combo to me.   They weren't very crowded in the middle of the afternoon, so my gf and I got a seat real quick. I had a good buzz going, so we opted for something off the Tiny Buns section of the menu. I went with the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, my gf had the Meat Ball Grinder. We also got an order or shoestring fries. I contemplated getting an alcoholic milkshake, but I figured it would be a waste since the food & shake itself would likely counteract the effects of the alcohol, and I also assume the amount of booze in each shake is equivalent to one conservative shot.   The Meat Ball Grinder was good, but I also have yet to find a meatball anywhere on Earth as good as my Dad's, so I'm going to be biased eternally. The Pork Belly, however, was so goddamn good. The key was the Asian steamed bum it was served in. It's like someone sliced a little circle of fluffy goodness of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and used it to bundle up my delicious pork product. I've never eaten anything like it before. The fries were boring, although shoestring has never been my favorite. They're pretty typical for a place that seems to thrive on atypical offerings.   I'm definitely coming back here with a bigger appetite to try some of their full-serve offerings, and maybe one of those gourmet booze-infused milkshakes. They aren't too expensive, and the food is killer.",

The restaurant was right outside the elevator! No wait on a Saturday at 3pm, but still pretty crowded. Service was fast and friendly. They give you complimentary popcorn but it is stale :(  We ordered the rising sun burger which was delicious! And a pretty good size to share :) The kobe beef was perfectly cooked to medium as we requested. Cannot go wrong with this. We upgraded to onion rings which was tasty and crispy, but came in a small serving (they serve it in like a mini bucket, see picture).   We also ordered the lobster Mac and Cheese and buffalo chicken dip. These also were fairly small servings but with all three items, my fiance and I still had leftovers. Mac and cheese was delish, with a slight hint of truffle and chunks of lobster. Awesome. Buffalo chicken dip came recommended by the waitress but I would not order it. FIrst of all, the tortilla chips that came with it were stale! Just like the popcorn! I'd expect more from a restaurant in a nice hotel (especially for the prices). The dip itself was okay, had a nice kick to it from the tobasco and had chunks of cheese in it, but the texture with the stringy chicken was really weird. And it was on the salty side. I think I had expected something different, like actually buffalo chicken pieces WITH a dip, but even then, I was not excited by this dish.   -2 stars for the prices, popcorn, and chicken dip but everything else was good!",

Rule No. 2:  Refer to Rule No. 1  Fresh from a Cosmopolitan Event at the Yard, their fourth floor pool, with ThreeKindsOfRumAndMangoPuree powerhouse drink in hand, my husband and I descended from up above for a burger at Holstein's.  Having attended a lot of beautiful, upscale, free functions at the Cosmopolitan, making it my favorite casino hotel, it was time to give back and actually patronize and pay for a meal there.   Now I've traveled a good part of the world and most of the United States, and almost always have something drinkable in my hand, usually a Starbucks cup but, in a casino it's more likely a glass of wine after I've been gambling for a while.  Never, ever, ANYWHERE, have I been told that I can't bring an outside drink in.  This forced me either to leave the drink or chug-a-lug it.  Guess what I did?  But I wasn't happy.  The manager, when asked about their policy, was completely lame.  \"We don't want anyone to get drunk.\"  Duh, is that why they have a full bar, complete with multiple flat screen TVs showing all manner of sports programs???    Bad beginning.  But I have to tell you that my burger - the California Turkey burger - may have been the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Moist.  Perfectly seasoned.  On a bun that was dense, so it didn't turn to mush like at all the other burger joints.  With all the other good stuff, too:  guacamole, pepper jack cheese, a huge tomato slice that was actually red and ripe, and a bit of slaw.  The steak fries were crisp, hot, and stayed hot, probably due to the little metal pail they're served in.  My husband had Brisket Burger, a beef burger with a topping of juicy brisket in barbecue sauce.   He loved it.  He also loved his sweet potato fries, which were presented as one of the four potato options to accompany the burger.  But he wasn't told that there was a two-buck upcharge for them, which is a no-no in my book.  We didn't try the shakes, because we were too full from all the drinks and chips we stuffed ourselves with upstairs, but they look great.    Our waitress was efficient, but not all that friendly, until she delivered the check.  Then it was all smiles and profuse thanks.  And we did appreciate the 15% discount for locals, though I'm not sure if it's a regular policy or because we bitched about the drinks.  Given the quality of the food, we'll definitely go back.  Hmmm, if I pour my drink into a Starbucks cup, I wonder...",

Extremely busy but great customer service staff to keep up. Server was very nice and attentive. She asked how we were doing couple times and she added avocado at last minute on my burger as requested. Very clean restaurant including bathroom. I order a Rising Sun burger and Gold Standard burger. Both added avocado. Both burger were around $18 each, not bad price for a very upscale burger restaurant. My Rising Sun was delicious, crispy patty outside, tender and juicy inside. The sauce in the burger was AMAZING, a twist of Asian side and I loved it. I kept licking my fingers throughout the whole meal. My girlfriend's Gold Standard was good she said. Juicy and arugula on top makes it different.  Overall would recommend to anyone to this place.

Needless to say, having traveled purely for the purpose of eating, expectations were high for the 'Rising Sun' burger + those enticing shakes (drunken monkey).  I could see why so many praise the food but I've had much, much better elsewhere.   Being raised in SoCal, i LOVE me some avocado.. but is it necessary to fry it?! AS IF YOUR ARTERIES ARENT CRYING ALREADY. If at any point in my life I felt like I would overdose off of sodium/ glucose content, it was during this sitting from that teriyaki glaze. The (virgin) Drunken Monkey was delicious, though.   Had I opted for the alcoholic version of the shake, maybe I would've been happy enough to push it to a 4!",

The insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. I am pretty sure these are frozen, though. My grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and I tried those. Pretty sure these were the exact same ones.   My husband is a huge burger fan. I don't know if he loves anything more. He got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter). When I asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. I was shocked. He said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else.   I had the blackened salmon po-boy. It was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. I had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. Overall, a good choice. The slaw on it was really good. I got sweet potato fries and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. Good, but nothing crazy amazing.  We didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah. It's a fun place. Nothing really too bad about it so I'll give it a 4 star. Maybe I'll have to go back with more people in the future to get a better idea of what it's like.",

My roommate and I shared the Rising Sun Burger with a side of fries and I was NOT disappointed. The meat was SO juicy and damn those fries and dipping sauces are yummy. I LOVED the avocado that was slipped into my burger (I might be biased ... I'm such an avocado lover) along with the perfect touch of teriyaki glaze to give it that Asian flare.   The portions are large enough to share if needed; however the prices are definitely on the high side. The place was crowded and the servers were a little on the slow side. Overall though, this place is definitely a new favorite spot.   Don't come here to look for cheap burgers, fries, and shakes - this place is definitely gourmet and for the ones who won't mind spending 17 dollars on a burger. BUT, like I said, it's worth a visit. Next time I wanna try the shakes ... since this place IS famous for that. Haha",

The Cosmopolitan hotel is an upscale establishment located in the new City Center development.  We were staying at the Belllagio, and the Cosmpolitan was right next door.  The restaurant is located on the second floor.  It was a bit loud and chaotic when we got there--which is probably to be expected on a busy Friday in Vegas.  I started with the Cereal Bowl--an incredible vanilla milkshake with vanilla vodka and CAPTAIN CRUNCH mixed in--awesome--though not super potent from an alcohol standpoint.  I had the Hen House burger--which is a burger with bacon and fried egg on top, and I added American cheese.  The burger was fantastic, cooked to order, and served with seasoned steak fries which were a bit dull compared with the rest of the food (you can order shoestring fries instead).  As said in another review--the juiciness of the burger definitely soaked the bottom bun making it a bit unappetizing.  From a service standpoint we were seated immediately, and then there was some confusion as one server took our drink order--which took about 10 minutes to fill, and another server then took over.   After that the server was quite attentive despite being very busy.  Though not a cheap restaurant--Holsteins was reasonably priced for this part of the strip.  The ambience was fun and bright, and I would definitely return for the shake!",

You get the option of two different fries, the steak fries or shoestring. I ordered the steak fries which were really tasty and the better of the two choices. This ran me about $17. The serving size was a little on the smaller side.   All of my friends ordered a shake which looked bomb! and all they were saying was mmmmmmm so good! but im alergic to milk so i could not experience the ooohhh ahhhhh milkshake. The best one out of all was the drunken money so try that one, they even have a little alcohol in it. Thats vegas for ya!  the restaurant was located near the chandelier bar inside the Cosmo. They seated our rather larger party of 13 within 20 minutes. restaurant was really nice inside and had loud music so it was a fun atmosphere. so definitely try it out for yourself if you get the chance",

I got the simple cheeseburger and just added avocados and fries ( their thin fries are very good) and I was very satisfied. I can't say it's the best burger I've ever had but definitely in the top!     The manager was also very nice! The waitress had made a mistake with our order ( we were a large group) and he personally came over to apologize and get our order straight. Next time i'm in vegas and craving burgers i'll definitely stop by!",

Think it'd be like last time I asked the server at the bar which shake was her favorite and she didn't know.... I asked her which is more popular; the grasshopper shake or the banana monkey one (names might not be right) and she told me their both completely different.... so I just stuck with what I knew was best.... the Oreo shake.... I hope next time I go I will just go with my gut and get what sounds best.",

I'm a simple girl at heart and ended up ordering their version of a rootbeer float. It was taaaasty and the pop rocks sprinkled on top were a fun reminder of the simpler times. And, most importantly, I confirmed that if you drink soda and have pop rocks your stomach will not explode.  The burgers are a-okay. Premium, restaurant burgers that are good and some pretty interesting combos. But, in the end, they were just okay. I actually went with the veggie patty. It was pretty tasty. Made in the kitchen, not some boca burger slapped on a bun. But, still... it was just alright.   OH. And... TRUFFLE LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE. Yum. We actually asked them to leave the plate with the leftover sauce and... um... used our fries to soak up the bechemal and truffle. SO good.  5 star milkshakes 4.5 star mac & cheese 4 star service and atmosphere 3 star burgers = solid 4 overall!",

    "text": "My verdict: requires further investigation. The environs and menu are creative and stylish, and yes, I appreciate an extensive list of alcoholic milkshakes. There's pretty much something for everyone, as long as everyone is up for some variation of a burger, including a vegan burger. All of this of course comes with Strip prices, so expect to spend around $18 a person for a burger and fries. Alcohol not included.   First impression is a little bucket of popcorn they bring to the table. It's cute, but just some popcorn in a bucket.   I had the turkey burger and onion rings. The turkey burger is a substantial creation, and it manages to be both big and juicy! Quite the accomplishment for a turkey patty. The toppings included sprouts and some tasty avocado spread. I will say that it definitely was not salty, but it didn't leave my taste buds poppin'. The cheese wasn't completely melted, and there wasn't a zing. I liked it, but I didn't love it.  And, then there were the onion rings. I paid $2 extra for these, and I was hoping for a good return on the investment. Alas, the onion rings were on the border of being burnt, and as a result, the onion was almost obliterated. I want more onion than breading. Varsity onion rings, anyone? (It's an Atlanta thang.)  I would definitely give it another shot, especially to sit in the bar/lounge area and sip on a shake, but on this visit, everything added up to be a good, but not divine, experience.",

    "text": "The draw to this place was the alcoholic milkshakes. And at $11, I thought they'd be stronger, the food would be better and it would be more enjoyable. We waited a while for a table despite there being many open tables...and when we sat down, the table was dirty.   There are plenty of toppings available for your burger, and they include cheeses, and all sorts of things. If you can think of it, it's probably available to put on your burger. However, I was so disappointed that my mom's food was not to her liking that it made me not even want mine. She opted to order the lobster roll as her salad tasted pretty rancid (you could argue that who goes to a place with Buns in the name and orders a salad, but hey....if you just bought me a pair of Louboutins for Christmas, you can order whatever the hell you want!)...and it served as our late night snack.   Lobster Mac and Cheese was passable...not enough lobster, weird kind of noodles and extremely salty.   The staff seemed to be phoning things in, as I almost had to chase the girl down to pay the check, and once she saw we weren't happy with our food, it seemed like she lost interest...maybe thought we'd take it out on the tip...not sure. I plan on returning to Vegas, but definitely NOT to this place.",

The bar area has 4 tvs and 2 of them was playing the same game. We asked if we can change one of the tvs to the niner game but the bartender said its not possible. A few minutes later another man sat down by us and asked the same bartender if she can change the channel to the jets game and with no hesitation changed it. I don't get it we were all ordering drinks, onion rings, fries, and sliders so we were paying customers. The jets guy only had one beer and ended up on his ipad not paying too much attention to the game!   The cocktails were not strong at all but the fries and sliders were small and nothing spectacular. The other bartenders were really nice and refilled our drinks and cleared our plates right away. They checked on us periodically without being overbearing. Even tho we stayed for the whole game they didn't make us feel like we were getting kicked out.  Maybe next time I'll try the restaurant area and hopefully the service and food is much better.",

    "text": "Deeeeelish! But you may feel too bloated, too sluggish, too lardy to be productive. But you'll feel very satisfied you had a yummy meal. (Though, at $76 for lunch, we could have done without a few dishes. More on that later.)  My husband and I went on a Sunday morning at 11:05 after they first opened for the day. We got seated right away at a table near the flat screens to watch the games, but within 10 or 15 minutes, the place was jam packed with diners.   Here's a rundown of what we ordered: All very well executed, though would have benefitted from a few minor changes. Fun novelty items too.   1. Fried Pickles: loved this preparation, because these fried pickles are spears, not chips that fall apart and taste nothing like a pickle. This gives each bite a nice tang. Flavorful sauce condiment and nice touch to have sliced meats on the side. Also came with fried olives ad fried capers...though the capers were kinda dried and tasteless.   2. Crispy Pork Belly Bun : Steamed mantou type buns (two mini sized) and two large chunks of crispy pork belly and hoisin. Very, very good,  I've had variations of this dish many times, and this one is nice. Very fatty, very crisp and flavorful. Though. I'd appreciate more cilantro, and some acid to cut through the fat.   3. Rising Sun Burger: juicy and hot, slathered in sauce, kimchi and a fried egg...get your napkins! Just get is. That's all I have to say about this one.   4. Tenderloin Rossini: pork tend loin sliders with foie gras (sp? I dunk, I dot eat enlarged duck liver...is that right, very often!) was good...but as always with tenderloin, desperately needed some fat. Came with house made chips, but would have preferred fries or rings.   5. Cake Lollypop, Nitrogen Merangues, (SP?) Push Pop: Strawberry cheesecake Lollypop was delicious, dipped in white chocolate and had a small strawberry gel disc on top. The nitro meringue (SP?) is bubblegum flavored, and  tiny, but prepared tableside and more for show than anything. Blow smoke for 30 seconds and impress your friends! For $2 it's a fun way to end a meal. The push pop...overrated. Nice novelty, but the sorbet is hard and makes it difficult to eat. Cute concept though.   Service rocked. Glasses always full, plates cleared as soon as we were finished. Warm environment, creative menu items. Would hit up again...and would try the long list of milkshakes!",

    "text": "Thanks to Holsteins yummy Bam-Boozeled shakes (with the help of many cocktails beforehand), I can hardly remember a thing about my dinner here.  After polishing off many rounds of happy hour cocktails at Comme CA, a group of eight of us found ourselves at Holsteins (located inside the gorgeous Cosmo hotel) for dinner on a Friday evening.   The first thing I need to tell y'all is that all eight of us were fairly intoxicated before entering Holsteins. And after all eight of us ordered a Bam-Bozzeled shake with extra shots of alcohol to start our meals, the rest of the evening became quite a blur. Such a blur, in fact, that even though every single person ordered a different burger from their large menu (we also ordered appetizers), and even though I took a bite of everything ordered, I can't really recall everything I tried and if I even enjoyed it. I'm just glad I took pictures, otherwise I would have been totally guessing on some of the food we ordered. This is just a few of the items I tried that fun night at Holsteins;   Drunken Monkey Shake- Reese's, Banana, Malt, & Frangelico Liquor Cereal Bowl Shake- Cap'n Crunch & Absolut Vanilla Vodka Campfire Smores- Smirnoff Marshmallow Vodka, Chocolate, Marshmallow & Graham Crumble Pork Belly Buns Salt & Vinegar Popcorn (Complimentary) The Rising Sun Burger (I ordered this)- Kobe Beef Burger, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado Gold Standard Burger- Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger W/ Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli The Longhorn Burger- Beef Patty Topped W/ Texas Smoked Beef Brisket, Whiskey BBQ Sauce, Creamy Cole Slaw & Dill Pickles  I do remember that we all thoroughly enjoyed our adult shakes. They were sweet and thick but the bartenders were more than generous with the alcohol because every shake was just as strong or even stronger than the cocktails we had before entering Holsteins.   I can honestly say I slightly do remember my burger being damn tasty. I loved the teri glaze on the patty and the tempura avocado was a nice touch. This burger reminded me of something I'd get at Umami in LA. As for the rest of the burgers and the apps go, I'm assuming I and everyone else enjoyed them because every plate was licked clean.   From what I remember the service was great and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fun and upbeat. The prices here are really reasonable.    I will definitely try Holsteins again. Next time I'll just make sure to be sober before eating here so I can fully remember my experience. Till that day comes I'll give Holsteins a solid 4 stars.",

Some of my issues: 1.  It took the waitress 20 minutes to get water (just water) 2.  3 waiters serviced us through the meal so there was a lot of confusion if we ordered or not.  3.  Finally we placed the order and it's been 40 minutes since we came in and no burger so far on our table.  4.  Every table around us got ketchup and mustard brought to their table before the meal.  I am still waiting for mine  5.  Waited another 10 minutes for salt and pepper shaker  6.  I asked for avocado on the side and they missed it.  The only positive thing I can say is about one waitress Chelsea. She was not assigned to our table but was always coming and checking as we will waiting.  Alex the manager spent more time flirting with the waitress than attending to what was happening. He was 2 tables away from us but oblivious to what was going on. Finally when our waiter Kenny went and told Alex about our concern Alex came, dropped the check at our table and walked away. For the note, we never asked for a discount and refused dessert on the house. This is not about money but the unpleasant experience.",

My friend and I decided to share The Gold Standard and The Fun-Ghi. I think mushrooms, caramelized onions, truffle, and cheese are a holy combination so of course I loved the Fun-Ghi. It was every topping I could possibly want on a burger. I did like The Gold Standard, but I don't eat bacon so I ate my half without it. I'm sure that took away from the flavor because although I did enjoy it, I didn't think it was mindblowingly delicious or that flavorful. Something that kinda threw me off was the patties. We ordered medium rare, but they were cooked pretty medium. I think they would have been all the more juicy and delicious had they been cooked a bit less!  I really wanted a shake, but I couldn't justify spending $10+ for a milkshake. In-n-out milkshakes are perfect and they're like $3 :l Maybe next time if I'm feeling especially rich~  Overall, a satisfying and hangover-approved Vegas meal.",

Steakhouse Burger was perfectly done and absolutely delicious. Sweet potato fries also crispy and sweet, fabulous onion rings. Decor is awesome with hilarious pictures of their cow logo. Jordan was our server and she helpful and friendly (and cute). High recommendation in a city with many overpriced sub-par burgers.",

I'm always looking for a GREAT burger so when I hear about Holstein's I was eager to try it. Matching the vibe of the Cosmopolitan, Holstein's is a burger joint with a mix of night life.  Service here was great as our server was quite friendly. We sat in the bar area since there was no wait. But I wouldn't recommend eating in the bar area tables. The tables are too low for eating. I scoured the menu for all the unique options for burgers and eventually decided on the Gold Standard, one of their most popular burgers. It was well-cooked with some good toppings. I did not care for the chive-garlic aioli. It wasn't a flavor I cared for. The standard french fries are good though.  Holstein's is well known for their grown-up milkshakes with liquor in them. Go ahead and hate me for not trying one but it sounded too rich and thick for me at the time. I was already quite full.  Overall, Holstein's wasn't too bad. The burger was average to good but not quite award-winning for me personally. But I appreciated the friendly service and those cartoon cows are just oh so cute!",

    "text": "When venturing to the Cosmopolitan, you expect pricey food and the like. And as far as burger meals go, Holstein's is up there in price, but what you don't see is how much food you can get for that amount of money.  I ordered the Longhorn Burger, which comes with beef brisket on top. This was $17, but it also came with fries (Although if you wanted to substitute for sweet potato fries it's an extra $2.50). Now for a place that specializes in meat quality, this actually isn't that bad. And the fries are tasty too!  As good as Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is, this would only be about $2-$3 more for way more food. And the patty is actually a little bigger. My recommendation is to get it medium-rare.  However, the burger isn't quite as good. Although the meat quality is exceptional, it lacked the flavor that many other gourmet burger spots would have. All the taste came from the brisket and the barbecue sauce.   There were too many ingredients on the burger itself. But I took the coleslaw and pickles out and it was perfect--one of the best barbecue burgers I've had.  When it comes to good deals on the Strip in relation to food quality, this one is up there for me. The burgers may not be perfect, but if you customize it how you want, you shouldn't be disappointed.",

The aged goat cheese provided a gaminess to the burger, which really elevated the flavor profile. The bacon provided a smokiness, which is reminiscent of a smokehouse. The dry aged patty really brought out a beefiness that is not ordinarily found in most burgers. The tomato aioli, arugula, and other remaining components was able to bind together and make it just a great interpretation of a classic burger.

We ordered our burgers on the med-well side, but were more well, but still good. Next time we'll order them medium instead, so they are more juicy.  I've never had goat cheese on my burger and it added a yummy creamy flavor.  My daughter and hubby had their milkshakes - one chocolate and the other strawberry - both without alchohol. Their milkshakes come with alchohol, so you can order without.  The milkshakes were thick, creamy and full of yummy flavor.

Of course, the general public is pretty much sick of the standard beef patty, lettuce, onion, cheese, and mayo on a bun.    That's why Holsteins is so much fun.  There is a plethora of tasty toppings, meats and styles that you can add onto your burger to give it that funky kick that is missing from burgers you get at home.  Offerings such as the Crispy Pork Belly Bun, Maine Lobster Roll, Tenderloin Rossini, and Maine Lobster Roll tantalize the taste buds.  I would recommend the Crispy Pork Belly Bun.  Its like eating bacon on crack.   If you are at the Cosmopolitan and hungry it is def worth a stroll.",

However, she was on top when it came down to our orders.   I got the Fun Ghi burger, which they pronounce fungi but should be pronounced more like \"fun jee\"....anyways, the burger was $17 but should have been more of a $14-15 burger.   The mark up must have been from the \"truffle oil\" that they claim they put in it but I couldn't taste truffle at all. Came with streak cut fries but I would recommend getting shoestring fries.

We enjoyed our medium-well  burgers but next time we'll probably go with medium being that the patty could've been juicer.  But still, not bad. We split two burgers between the two of us since we both had mentioned we wanted to try them. The Fun-ghi burger was absolutely delicious! You can taste the truffle in every bite. Truffle and Gruyere cheese in the same burger? Perfection! The Gold Standard is their most popular burger and I can see why. They took the all-classic cheeseburger and deconstructed it. First, the cheese isn't just your typical cheddar, it's an aged goat cheddar. Second, instead of adding a thick slice of tomato, that usually creates a mess and ends up sliding out anyway, they added a tomato confit! Lettuce was replaced with arugula which gave the burger a lot of flavor. Bacon, bacon, bacon! And for the best part instead of plain mayo this burger had a garlic chive aioli. Ah-maze-ing! This changed the whole dynamic of the burger! Honestly, I don't even remember what the buns were like because I was too busy enjoying all the unique flavors inside. The only downside to our meal was that I was so excited to have the \"unndon\" cake for dessert that I skipped on the raved about shakes. I came to find that it was a seasonal item that is no longer on the menu. Seriously?! Until they bring that back I am not returning. Take a look at the pictures others posted of it and tell me that does not look amazing? If you don't think so, then there's something definitely wrong with you. Sorry. We ended up getting the Dulce de leche cheesecake because #1 I love anything DDL and #2 it said it had Frosted Flakes cereal in/on. Normally, I wouldn't even eat cheesecake unless it's the Godiva or S'mores ones from The Cheesecake Factory but the description made this one hard to skip. It had the perfect consistency, too! The densely moist cracker crust underneath tasted like a combination of crushed gingerbread man and snicker doodle cookies. Salivating much? For the perfect bite you have to start at the top, taking a bit of the whipped cream, FF cereal, cheesecake and then sweep it all up with the trail of oozing caramel sitting next to it. Yummmmm-meee!! Now remember, their desserts are seasonal so hurry in!",

The service was pretty fast and the waitress was extraordinarily accommodating regarding my order for quadruple steak on my salad.    The environment is a little noisy but not in a bad way. It's just busy and that's kind of the vibe of the place, very upbeat. Having been in enough spots in casinos that are like crypts, this was a welcome change.   It's a little pricey but that's Vegas for you...the quality is high enough that you shouldn't be concerned about it.

Nothing besides the burger itself was mind-blowing, though, and this place is expensive - not by Vegas standards, just by normal city standards. Anyway, I'll visit again next time I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan.",

Yesterday's lunch there was horrible   The burger bun was cold: the burger mediocre.  The table next to us sent their burger back as well.  We were truly disappointed.   In a city with such great burgers like Stripburger and BurgerBar and Burgr we will not be going back to Holsteins.  Sad!",

We were sitting in the lounge area by the bar doing some drinking, and unbeknownst to us, the waitresses here are scantily clad, sporting massive jugs. I'll get to the food in a second.  So we're sitting down and the waitress is right behind my friend Zach. She says, \"Would you guys like any drinks?\" Zach swiveled around to answer and accidentally got a face full of 36 F's. Like, an unintentional motorboat. Great life moment. Also, the little hostess with the tongue ring is highly attractive in that librarian kind of way, and you know she also owns thigh high boots... na'mean? I'd shake those buns. I'd let her hold my stein. With my eyes open and the lights on. Mmmmhmmm darlin'.  The shakes. The shakes are insanity in a glass. I ordered a Compost shake and immediately wanted to vomit. I mean that in the best way possible. Think of like - an excitement induced vomit. Like when you get married or something. Actually, that's probably not the best analogy. What I'm trying to say is the shakes are incredibly rich and tasty, and I would recommend the Compost shake to anyone who was punishing themselves with tastiness.  The burgers. The burger I ate was so delicious, there are no words to describe it. The best way to describe it would be to make a series of guttural noises and then pass out face down into a pile of puppies. I hadn't had anything like the kobe burger in a long time, and it's just what I wanted. My pants also wanted it, because I came home with the bad kind of stained pants. Messy burger.  Two other things that stood out for me were the awesome art adorning the walls, and my waiter's enormous handlebar mustache. Good on you, mate!",

At first they said there was a long wait but we were patient and only waited  10 min and they sat us.  Servers were very friendly and service was good. I started out with a bloody marry which was ok. needed a little more hot sauce. I shared the \"Rising Sun\" with my girlfriend, meat was tender and juicy. It had a good flavor and the bun was tasty as well. I loved the avocado inside; gave it a nice smooth taste with it.   The Thing that gave this place 4 stars is the peanut butter shake; I believe the Chocolate Monkey ( I might be wrong). It had chocolate and peanut butter with some baileys Irish cream. If you were to give this shake to a child they wouldn't taste the alcohol. lol. Its so smooth. Enjoyed this place very much.",

    "text": "The Gold Standard burger lives up to its name and more. Possibly the best burger that I have ever had in my life!  Their shakes are a fun treat as well. The Apple Pie is one of my faves, with real bits of apple, making it literally taste like they shoved an entire pie in a blender with some rum and ice cream and served it in a giant glass. Also, they give you the extras, so you're really having 2 milkshake glasses instead of one. A tiny girl like me can take one down and be content for the rest of the evening.  Here's a fun tip for you club-goers: Head to Marquee early and get your stamp. Once you're in, get your drank/dance on for a bit and then leave to go to Holsteins downstairs for a mid-club snack. When you're done, go back upstairs to Marquee's re-entry line and dance the burger/night away. Best way to spend a night in Vegas.",

Hubby got a loaded shake, the Drunken Monkey... it was supposed to be a banana/peanut butter/chocolate shake but no banana flavoring was detected.  He said it was still excellent, just not what he thought he was ordering.  Appetizers... we got the fried pickles, which were very good... and the fried green tomatoes, which were extremely excellent.  I got the mini-buns with the asian pork belly, which I loved, and a side order of fries (ridiculous quantity, but good).  Hubby got the Korean Bull-gogi burger, and it was fantastic.  One of the rare places where a medium burger is actually cooked to medium instead of well done.  Ingredients were fresh, food was excellent.. they even make their own mayonnaise & ketchup (Udder sauce) in house.  We will definitely be returning to sample more items.. oh, and they gave us a 15% off locals discount, which we hadn't expected.. very nice!",

The Gold Standard is a more-than-appropriate name for their most popular burger on the menu - dry aged beef sirloin with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli.   Get this. Please get this. Apparently it's won awards or something - I believe it.  Strong cocktails, crispy fries, and perfect burgers - eat at Holsteins today!   (^not a paid advertisement)",

I ordered 'The Rising Sun' made to order:Medium and it was cooked perfectly! The tempura avocado was an awesome crunch that complimented the nori furikake. This was the perfect choice due to being lactose intolerant and not having to worry about special ordering without cheese! It was a great hamburger with a little bit of an Asian twist and taste!   The kobe beef pattie was a great size and like I said definitely cooked medium as asked!!   Also, can't forget about the French fries! They're crispy and the size was not too thin or thick, just perfect!   My boyfriend ordered the Campfire S'mores milkshake and said it wasn't too thick or thin, that the consistency of the milkshake itself was great! Only tip he gives is to not finish it before your food or you'll be pleasantly full from it!  Our server was amazing and super attentive! He took great care of us, ensured our waters were always filled and that everything was tasting well! He also gave us recommendations on what to order! He made great conversation with us and made us feel very welcomed!   All in all, I give this restaurant a 10/10!! Definitely will be returning when visiting Vegas again!!",

Definitely kid friendly. Our waiter, Carlo, was outstanding. The burgers were thick and juicy and were paired nicely with the Udder Sauce and the usual add ons. I'm not sure what side of a pound that patty was, but I couldn't finish it. Get the onion rings though instead of fries. The buttermilk batter around those sliced onions is fried to perfection and not one was greasy. Finally, make sure you ask your waiter for the Nitrogen Merengues and have your camera ready.

This is a great spot for a quick meal though if you don't feel like waiting somewhere else or breaking the bank. The service was better than average and they checked often to see if we needed refills or something else. Unlikely to return as there are a ton of places to frequent in Vegas.

The rising sun is an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado; a lot goin on - I wasn't impressed. The shake was delicious.  I like the fact that they offer late night bites. However, there are just too many other great burger places to choose from. Holsteins falls flat. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing; it came highly recommended by our server. Regardless, I don't need to spend another $18 on a burger here only to be disappointed and unfulfilled again. I probably won't return.",

It came with fries and I would hope so for the price your paying. We also tried the Drunken Monkey (without alcohol) I know I know...no fun but it was too early to be drinking in my opinion. I give it a 4/10...perhaps it needed that liquor after all or maybe it just didn't leave a lasting impresion. Flavors were all there but it didn't have a wow factor.

    "text": "The last few years of kicking my foodie habit into overdrive has probably made me a bit snobby, but I'm truly surprised that many here are saying that Holstein's dished up the best burger that some have ever had. My burger was fine, but it certainly wasn't anything that went above and beyond A-OK.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The highlight of my visit to Holstein's was without a doubt the service and atmosphere, which complimented the obviously excellent location. I rolled in on the later side of a Thursday evening and walked by several times over the course of the weekend: while crowded, there was rarely a wait, which was refreshing. From there my bartender doubling as my server was excellent, and I left feeling good about the experience even though the food didn't blow me away. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  While my $15 threshold for a sit-down burger of any kind is often a pretty hard ceiling, I'm going to have to relent when it comes to Vegas prices on the strip. My Steakhouse Burger and side of fries came to $18.00, and while that would normally be enough for me to take a good critical look at this star, I have no choice but to chalk that cost up to the Vegas premium. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Honestly my Steakhouse Burger was just okay, which was a bit of a letdown given the impressive laundry list of ingredients and peripherals. The black pepper crusted patty had some very good flavor, but it was simply too small given the size and quantity of other toppings and the lofty bun. The mixed greens went well with the proprietary steak sauce, but the marmalade onions were overpowering to the point where I didn't really even realize that the wild mushrooms and swiss cheese were in the mix.   Probably the low point of the meal was the french fries, which, soft, limp and tasting as though they came out of a frozen bag, didn't add anything to the equation. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Holstein's is probably worth a visit, but I can't recommend it over some of the other options in town. No Star Granted.",

When we finally got there, they quickly seated us and got us water.   Our waitress was super nice, and when she realized it was his birthday she joked around with us and made us feel like we were the most important people there. He got a a blackberry crush cocktail to drink - I stuck to water since I was the DD for the night, haha. To eat, I got the Urth Burger with regular fries, and he got the Rising Sun Burger. Mine was super delicious, and the garlic mayo I got on the side was to DIE FOR. Fiance said his burger was awesome, and ate the entire thing. To finish the meal, we ordered him a cookies and cream bamboozled shake. He really loved it, and the giant cookie on top, but the only bad part was that the cookie came out frozen and even though we let it defrost the entire meal, it was still pretty cold when we went to leave, so he didn't get to really eat it.  Our waitress helped us celebrate by bringing us macaroons in liquid nitrogen. It was so much fun, and so good! I was super appreciative she did that, since not all restaurants on the strip celebrate birthdays.   Overall, my first impression of Holstein's was super positive. My main issue with it, is that they offer a vegan patty - the burger I got - but their buns have powdered milk in them. For me, powdered milk isn't *too much* of a big deal, but for anyone else it might seem misleading to offer a vegan patty without a vegan bun. The waitress did offer to wrap mine in lettuce instead, but I really wanted the satisfying taste of a patty and a bun.",

Second: We asked for a bacon avocado cheese burger without mayo and the server could not seem to figure out how to order one telling us \"you have to order something from the menu\" which we did after an exhausting time... Third: After waiting 1/2 hour for our burger and with a flight to catch we had to just leave hungry not eating anything. So we are now in a taxi heading to the airport starving... I would comment on how the burgers taste but since we never actually got one I can only assume they taste awful... DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE HUNGRY... Awful service and I still can't confirm they actually serve food... So dissapointing!",

Well I found this place on Yelp and was sold by the pictures.  The burgers at this place are amazing, not greasy or skimpy on the meat. Each burger is a half a pound of delicious goodness. The fries were also really good. Not greasy or soggy. Very crisp and fresh!! I didn't get to try a milkshake this time due to the fact I could barely finish my burger. I'll definitely be back to get a shake!  My family enjoyed the burgers and went back home full and happy!",

It's located at Cosmopolitan, and you will just fall in love with the decor and art work of all the cows! Yes, there's so many cows! Cows dressed up as Robin, a Spiderman pickle, and so much more!  We ordered:  1. Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese: Decent. Nice to share. I was pleased to see that there were lots of lobster pieces, but I felt that that the Mac n Cheese had more milk in it; it was more runny than creamy. There were some truffle pieces in the dish, but the truffle flavor was a bit lacking. My heart is still with Gordon Ramsay's truffle mac n cheese. (4/5)  2. Billionaire Burger: Go big or go home! There are so many great burger choices on the menu, but how often can one eat foie gras? This burger comes with Kobe beef, foie gras, truffle mayo and onions. Overall, the burger was very delicious and juicy. The foie gras was obviously the best part. Let me just tell you that this burger is HUGE! My bf added a fried egg to his, but I didn't add anything else to mine. Your burger order also comes with fries, which were great too. (5/5)  3. Chocolate Malt Shake: My bf was kind of disappointed with this one. It was decent for me, but I don't normally drink malted shakes. For him, it tasted more of a milkshake even though he ordered malt. If you don't finish it, you can request for plastic cups to take them to go. (4/5)  Service is friendly and everything was delicious! Definitely a good burger place to try when in Vegas! =)",

It says $20 and they expected us to know that meant the price for the \"souvenir\" growler container, plus the cost of the beer, which came out to $54. Maybe they are used to very rich clientele who don't care what their bill comes out to, but this was a very unpleasant and unexpected surprise. The manager did give us some beer to make up for it, so that's why they still get a decent review, but o don't think it's right for them to expect us to know that growlers are extra. Where we come from the price listed is the price you pay",

They also have 4 TVs behind the bar and it is great to be able to watch a few different games while you are having lunch or just a beer.   As the other reviewer noted, the shakes look amazing.

I wanted to review in 4.5 stars because I wish they would make the atmosphere a little more upscale (we're in Cosmopolitan and I want a Cosmopolitan-esque atmosphere) but then I suppose it wouldn't match the causal food they serve here. The waitress we had was super friendly, attentive, and very helpful when I was unsure what sort of drink I would like. We ended up having the bartender make a martini special for me and I liked it so much that I had two! The drinks here are great, food is phenomenal, the burger is possibly the best burger I have ever had. My husband enjoyed his meal also. We'll be back and we'll bring friends. They have huge ice cream (alcoholic) drinks that looks amazing. I couldn't see trying one after all that I had to eat here but another time I'd love to splurge and have one.",

The beer I ordered was forgotten and when it did arrive it was not the beer I ordered.

Perfectly cooked, nice and juicy.  Had that sweet korean bbq taste, kimchee slaw added a very little spicyness and a creamy spicy mayo.  One of the best burgers I've ever had.  For me, I would have liked a stronger korean bbq flavor for the meat and I wish the kimchee would be more spicy and more sour.  But that's me and I think they did a good job of giving you those flavors but not overwhelming you with it.  Served with shoestring fries  and also gave me a side of popcorn to munch on while I was waiting.  I also got a chocolate milkshake which was excellent.  I went to the Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay and I was somewhat disappointed.  This place is everything I had hoped the Burger Bar would be.  I am definitely going to go back and try a different burger.

You know the service is bad when you see all their other tables looking around for their server and looking generally disgruntled. We asked several times for things that we ordered with our meal and didn't receive them. I literally filled my own water with the water bottle I had because no one would fill our waters. The other servers were hanging out by the computers and not helping anyone in the restaurant, which was super frustrating. My burger was alright. The bun was super hard (almost inedible) and I didn't get the mushrooms I ordered on it so it was really disappointing. The side salad I got, however, was really good. I'm not sure what kind of dressing it had but it was delicious. I'm not quite sure why but we were given popcorn at the beginning of the meal. I would give this place another chance because it did have some redeeming qualities, but I would hope to have a more friendly and competent server next time.",

The beer in question costs $9.99 a six pack at Whole Foods. Strike 3: Although hubs and I ordered the same thing with no weird substitutions, one of the burgers came with garlic aioli on the side and we had to cut into the burgers to discern which was well done and which was medium.  For a $120 dinner I didnt expect to be so annoyed.  The quality of burger was all right; we both had the Gold Standard. The steak fries were actually seasoned potato wedges.

We decided we wanted a snack. They have an extensive appetizer menu but we wanted to try the burgers. Not being too hungry,  we split a burger \"el machet\". (Rememeber we were planning on filling up on tasty beer and hiting the strip. Doggie bags are not good luck on the game floor) It was tasty but not very spicy. Just tasted like an average good burger.  We were hoping for something with more heat. Our waitress must have decided we were cheap since we split a burger and never came back for refills or to check on us. In fact we couldn't get anyone to refill our beer. I guess it was good the burger wasn't spicy! Finally the waitress unceremoniously dropped our check off without saying anything. We paid, left, and took our money else where. Joke was on her. Alcohol always spikes the bill = bigger tip. The next wait staff enjoyed our money. If we wanted a full meal we would have sat in the dining room. If you want good service and multiple beers go somewhere else. If you want to be judged on your order by the world's most mediocre waitress,  this is your place! I'll withhold her name for class ;)",

Both burgers were huge! I really liked my burger, I wasn't too sure about the fried egg on a burger but that shit was amazing!

The boyfriend wasn't fond of his though - he said that brisket that came on top was really fatty and the brisket was the reason he ordered the burger. He helped me eat my burger which was fine because I could only eat a third of it anyways. I couldn't get enough of my fries either, those shoestring fries were amazingly addicting.

I understand that Cosmopolitan has the worst problem anywhere on the strip with escorts, but I don't think us girls look remotely like escorts, but the Holstein hostesses sure treated us like we were unwelcome guests of theirs.  A couple girls came late to dinner and filtered in, and each time the hostesses at the front door INSISTED that there was no party of ours in the back of the place despite us texting our girlfriends that we were inside.  This happened three times that the hostesses would not even let the girls walk to the back to find us.  Seriously the hostess would not let the girl walk in to Holsteins to find our party.  I couldn't believe it.  Most places in Las Vegas LOVE having pretty girls around and usually will even pay to have pretty girls in places or pay for their dinners.  The hostesses here acted like we were hookers or something instead.  When we complained to our server each time this happened she didn't know what to do or how to handle the situation.  She never got a manager and being servers ourselves we didn't insist.  We liked our waitress so we didn't want to be too fussy.  Since this happened I haven't been back but I guess I am open to it if I want a burger.  The food here really is good during that once-a-week time of the month for a girl when I can just kill a whole burger, a salad, a milkshake and especially the fried pickles.",

    "text": "So I had rad about this place on yelp and after reading the reviews I decided I would try it out. The food was good for the most part it was a party of seven and everyone had something different. The burgers where all just ok nothing special but I can say u do get a good size portion for what you pay for. Ordered some appz. And they where ok the best out of the where the steak and cheese spring rolls will be going back for some more of those. Next the chicken and waffles where bland at best and only came with one mini waffle. All the milk shakes where beeter than advertised although I didn't ft a chance to have one of my own all in all the place was jus ok nothing spectacular but I would go again for desserts and milk shakes. Food is hit or miss depending on what u order. Oh also turkey burger was on point for sure",

I got the Fun-ghi burger, which had portebello mushrooms that tasted great, truffle oil, some gruyere, frisee, carmelized onion and an aioli that was sweet.  The burger was overwhelming to me, it got tiring and I ended up just eating the mushrooms, the meat was cooked perfectly at medium rare but I feel the lack of truffle oil in my patty made it seem bland, I feel like they needed to pump that shit with it. I don't think the frisee works well, i prefer lettace. Comes with wedges or shoestring fries.  Service was cool",

    "text": "We arrived without a reservation at 8PM on a Saturday night and had to wait about 45 minutes. They said they'd text us, so we went down to the casino and did some gambling. 45 minutes later, I received no text, so we went back upstairs and checked in. We were seated after a brief pause, which made me wonder how long I'd be waiting for a text if I didn't go up and check back in.  We ordered the onion rings and two of their boozy milkshakes. A coworker recommended I try the onion rings, and they were fantastic. The order came out quick, as did the milkshakes. The milkshakes were awesome, barely a booze taste and worth the price.  Our entrees on the other hand took quite a while to arrive. I would guess nearly 30 minutes. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, but for a burger place on a Saturday night I had a hard time believing they weren't prepared for the evening rush.  I had the pork belly sliders which were excellent. If you've had pork buns at a Chinese restaurant, they were like that, including the soft bun and the sauce, but crispier and better. They serve 3 to a plate, which was enough for me but I was already getting full from the milkshake and the onion rings.  My wife had the Classic burger and said it was alright, but nothing extra ordinary. Considering it took 30+ minutes to come out, she said it was about as good as she's had at Red Robin. I had a bite and it was fine, but again I don't think it was anything amazing. It was a decent burger, properly cooked to a medium rare, not exceptionally huge or covered in exotic toppings, and considering the prices in Vegas, it was worth the $14.  Best part of the meal was the milkshakes and the onion rings. A word of caution about the milkshakes - they  fill you up! If you finish one it's like eating a huge ice cream sundae with booze on it. They are definitely worth the price.  If I'm gambling at or near the Cosmopolitan I'd give the place another try, maybe for lunch. The food was good and the price was right.",

We didn't try the shakes but they looked amazing as well. Excellent service from both wait and bus staff. We have definitely found our go to burger spot on the strip.",

    "text": "This place is pretty cool and pretty delicious.  It reminds me of some of my favorite restaurants in San Diego -- delicious twists on your everyday food (philly cheese steak spring rolls and truffle lobster mac n cheese?!?) and of course a huge beer selection.  Despite the huge temptation that the appetizer menu drew, I'd picked this place with burgers in mind and so I stuck with burgers and wasn't disappointed.  The Gold Standard Burger (beef sirloin, bacon, goat cheese, tomato confit, arugula & garlic-chive aioli) was excellent and cooked to medium perfection.  I payed a bit extra to have sweet potato fries instead of the shoestring, and though they were tasty I preferred the shoe string that I got to try off my boyfriends' plate.  The burger in addition to being a hefty portion was also flavorful in every way.  I was HUGELY satisfied.  Also tried the yummy artichoke guacamole (served with fresh made pita chips).  The atmosphere is kind of urban/trendy with fun, bright colored paintings on the walls.  The wait wasn't long on a Sunday afternoon (no one ahead of our large party, we just had to wait until the staff got a table together).  We had a hot waitress and plenty of other people walking around to bus tables and refill drinks and waters.  The whole experience was worth five stars and I can't wait to go back to Vegas and eat here again.",

I got a plain burger and it was just enough, spud fries were super duper hot when they arrived, so I didn't eat as many of those b/c they took sometime to cool.  Burger and fries $14.  Co-workers all got burgers and shakes, I went with burger n a beer, stick with what I know.  They all felt totally over stuffed when they left b/c the shakes are super filling and have alcohol in them to boot!  So think twice before you do the double duty of a burger and a shake.  Apparently they don't do duck fat fries anymore and recently have changed their menu.  Decent burger place, it's right next to a sports book, and you can watch sports there. very nice!",

    "text": "My Yelp friend Vi Y. recommended the Watermelon Bubblegum Icee - and I'm glad I listened!  It felt like that time when I needed to look over my shoulder before my dad or mom caught me spiking my drink!  It was such a fun drink with a great grown-up vodka twist - so sweet and refreshing, and definitely made me a happy girl.  Their other bamboozled shakes are just as intriguing and fun - how could you not want to try a grown up root beer float like a Brown Cow (Root Beer, Vanilla Ice Cream, Pop Rocks and Meyer's rum)?  As for the food we love to nosh on the small plates here.  There is a maply-sweetness to the batter in the Southern Fried Chicken Fingers-N-Waffles and comes with a small and cute waffle.  The buttermilk sauce definitely doesn't come from a bottle. Some might think this is a small serving but I think it's just right as I get to indulge on something like this without the 2000 calories a full order would have, and still have room to try other menu notables like:  Lobster/Truffled Mac and Cheese Crispy Pork Belly buns Shoe string fries Sweet Potato fries Korean \"Bull\"gogi burger  (soy marinated burger with fried egg, kimchee slaw)  The huzbeau and I have come here with just the two of us and another time with a party of four, and wait was minimal with no reservations.  But its always advisable to call if you plan on coming here during busy times like before a show (like a lot of people do)!  Service was attentive and its a great, casual atmosphere.  The graffiti artwork on the walls is amazing and very classy-urbanesque.  A great stop to make if you're in town - located right behind the beautiful Chandelier bar in the Cosmopolitan.",

    "text": "Upon hearing more bad than good reviews regarding this eatery, I decided that it wasn't worth the risk of a potentially bad meal. However, since a large group of us were already on property tonight, it was the best choice for a relatively inexpensive dinner.   I attempted to make a reservation via OpenTable, but it stated that there were no reservations remaining for the evening. Then I called. The hostess explained that they are no longer taking reservations for the evening, but she would be happy to get us a table when we arrived and that there was a \"short\" wait for less than 30 minutes. Since we were not physically at the restaurant, we could not put our name on the list. Humph. Anyway, we get to the restaurant and are given a 30-35 minute wait for our group of nine. A bit longer than I enjoy waiting, but it worked out well - we received our table within 10 minutes (and via text message; very convenient)!  Most of us decided on selections from the \"Big Buns\" category (good ol' burgers and fries). I had a hard time choosing between a couple of their burgers, but I'm very pleased that our server directed me to their most popular selection - the \"Gold Standard\" ($17.50). Dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli. HOLY TASTEBUDS. That first bite was euphoric. I can't even describe it, but I'll always remember how I felt - amazing. I was raving to everyone at the table and the two people that tasted my burger affirmed my praise, as well as stating that it was much better than the burgers they were eating (Memphis Burger - very tasty - and The Rising Sun - shrug). I've had other goat cheese-arugula-tomato burgers and this one does it MUCH better. Because the goat cheese is blended with cheddar (haven't quite wrapped my head around this yet lol), it isn't too pungent and all the other flavors were so well balanced. Get the Gold Standard; medium rare, of course. Really, really good.  With your \"Big Buns\" order, you have a choice of regular fries, side salad, or a $2 upgrade for sweet potato fries or thick cut onion rings. I got their regular fries and they were really tasty and well cooked. I also tried the Fried Pickles ($9) - perfect dill spears with good crispy exterior, served with an herb-caper mayo - and a Strawberry Milkshake ($8) - really creamy, delicious strawberry flavor. Overall, all the food was great!  Our server was really nice and very helpful, however, we received only one visit between receiving our food and finishing our meal, so most of our water glasses weren't refilled. Then we found ourselves having to wave our arms for attention. I figured the servers must be overwhelmed, but it seems that the restaurant is always busy and it's as if no one has figured out how to properly handle the capacity of customers.  I'm curious as to why people have been so unhappy with Holsteins, but I can guess. Based on our experience prior to and during our dinner, I'm sure they have their off days or the service may be even less attentive than it was today. Hopefully I won't have to experience any of those things during future visits or even better, that it'll improve!",

The price was similar to Sugar Factory (and this one has Vodka) and it was better.  We have had food there that was great too, most notably the fried pickles.

I highly recommend it.  However the service was okay here. Our waiter kept on pushing drinks on us, when we didn't want any and just asked for water he tried pushing bottled water. When we just wanted tap water, he had no smile and was pretty cold for us the whole night. My friend also got stomach problem from her food here. It was the only thing she ate all afternoon and night so we were sure it's from this place.  I'm very torn on this place because i really liked my burger... Sadly the experience here wasn't that great",

I had high hopes for this place, I love a good burger joint with creative shakes and side dishes. Boy was I wrong.   We weren't in the mood for a burger, so ordered some of their side dishes: Lobster & truffle mac Lobster roll Chicago dogs Shrimp cocktail Bloody Mary \"Black Cow\" float Decent amount of food right? Get this:  -5oz of macaroni -2 lobster rolls with no more than 3-4 oz of anything that wasn't \"roll\", TOTAL -3 hot dogs that were the size of my middle finger.  -3 shrimps with a shot glass of Bloody Mary .... And my \"black cow\" never came.   How much was all this?  NINETY DOLLARS. After they comped my float that never came.   I'd have been fine paying 50-60 (it is vegas, after all) for this meal, but 90? Bro ...  Add to this, we saw our waitress 5 times. The table next to us got very prompt an attentive service from another waitress, so finally we had to start asking her for help.",

I repeated some favorites from my first visit - the spicy bloody mary, the fried pickles, The Rising Sun, and the Frozen Grasshopper - and all were as remembered.  In fact I'm mostly updating this just to document my bachelorette party in full, so if you want to see a full useful review, please see the original and ignore this post, which is basically for my diary use only.  We came at around seven o'clock and were told they were so backed up they were turning people away.  We put our name and number down anyway, expecting to wait at least an hour and a half.  I guess a lot of people were discouraged enough to bail, because we were seated after something like forty minutes.  Service was good, polite and moderately quick.  A few of my friends and I use FourSquare (sorry, Yelp), and we each got a complimentary Holstein's Spacial (not a typo on my end) Lager.  It was tasty, refreshing, and free, and I'm sorry to admit that we were too full to finish them and felt pretty bratty.  We did leave a nice tip.  I did try a couple new things this time around, and I'll just note those here.  The Fun-Ghi (hey, you know that joke, don't you?) was a great burger with a beef patty, roasted portobello, caramelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere, frisee, and aioli.  The mushroom was great, and went really well with the beef.  All the other accompaniments took a back seat, letting the two top players have their day.  For dessert, we supplemented our Frozen Grasshopper with a Campfire Smores shake - Smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, and a graham cracker crumble.  I mean please I will never stock Smirnoff marshmallow vodka in my home bar, but it worked here.  The shake tasted like s'mores, and it was delicious.  My girls got my dinner, for which I am very grateful.  Holstein's was fun and full of tasty things, a great start to an epic bachelorette weekend.",

It's very hard to get a decent burger out in Surprise, AZ and as a burger    connoisseur I felt it was my mission to taste and to yelp. So I did. And it was spectacular.  Holsteins is located inside the Cosmopolitan and easy to get to. We were seated within 20 minutes and served almost immediately.  I didn't try their bamBOOZLE shakes (although I plan to next time) but a friend got their regular shake and it was great.   Each one of us got a different burger and were def not keen on sharing as it was tooooo good to not eat the whole thing. I got the Gold Standard burger with reg fries. It was cooked to a perfect medium and so juicy (that my mouth is watering as I type). The goat cheese and arugula really made it a tasty burger.  My beau got the Nom Nom burger. I'll never forget the way his face lit up when he took that first bite. He said it's one of the best burgers he's ever had. As a fellow burger connoisseur, he must mean business. It was cooked a little well for his taste but man that Kobe beef is bomb diggity. I highly recommend subbing your side for onion rings. I found myself sneaking a few fried rings whenever he was in the midst of mouth-gasm.   The burgers + drinks were a bit pricey but well worth it for the quality of the meal. This is def the best burger joint in Vegas. Holla!",

Located in the Cosmopolitan, the open dinning room is decorated with cheeky cartoons representing the food they serve. Our party of six came for an early dinner and they had no problem seating us around 6:00. Our server was prompt and provided exceptional service with accurate recommendations.  He immediately provided us with a round if waters and a bucket of complementary pizza-flavored popcorn.  The menu is simple offering some appetizers, salads and a dozen burgers.  I chose a medium Gold Standard burger which was recommended as the burger they were know for (sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli.) I opted for the sweet potato fries as the side. The burger was slightly over cooked and the meat lacked the juiciness I was expecting. The sweet potato fries were luke-warm and needed some type if seasoning. If I had not gotten the shake this would have been a three star review but then they brought out the Cookies & Cream shake! It was enough to split with a buddy as it includes whipped cream vodka, oreo & chocolate chip cookies and dark & white chocolate crunchies.  It is topped off with a full-size chocolate chip ice cream sandwich and vanilla frosting with oreo crumbs around the rim! Overall, Holsteins Shakes and Buns could be skipped for the burger but cannot be missed for the shakes!",

    "text": "To top off a successfull Vegas trip , we came to Holsteins hungry and anxious after seeing all the solid reviews. Located right across the entrance to Marquee, it's an all too familiar location, but unfortunately a location I probably won't return to.  Upon walking in, we were asked whether we wanted bar or table seating. The hostess literally stated that if we wanted a table, it would mean she would \"have to\" walk us over. She made it sound like we were causing the biggest inconvenience in the world to her if we didn't sit at the bar. Rude. We still went for a table, and she pointed us to another waitress who would take us. A horrible system.  It took 10 minutes to have a waiter even greet us after sitting down. Another 35 passed before we became intolerably grumpy and impatient, flagging down our waiter to see what was going on. Two burgers, one of which was rare, should not take 40 minutes to make. After a long day, 5 minutes was very agonizing, and our burgers finally came out.  - \"Meat Ball\" Burger ($15): Beef, pork, veal, pecorino & provolone cheese, basil walnut pesto and arugula on herb foccacia roll. The meat concoction was great, but it lacked flavor or marination. Of course, I loved all the cheese, but you could barely taste the walnut pesto. It could use some marinara sauce. Not the best choice here.  - The Fun-Ghi ($17): Beef patty, truffled marinated portabella mushroom, caramelized onion, gruyere, maro & frisee.  This one was much better and was wonderfully crafted. There was plenty of gruyere, you could taste the truffle oil in the mushroom, and all ingredients balanced well with each other. A superb burger indeed.   Fries with one burger, onion rings with the other. Both were good quality. The onion rings weren't too deeply fried and maintained a nice crunch.  - Banana Cream Pie Shake ($13): Bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banane, licor 43 and white chocolate covered banana. Absolutely delicious. Although it was technically two servings, a shake should not be worth as much as a burger. Also, there was barely any hint of alcohol in here. Despite this, I sipped it down to the last delicious drop.  After finishing our meal, it took another 20 minutes to hunt down a different waiter because ours kept ignoring us. The restaurant was less than half full and there was plenty of staff, so service like this is unacceptable. Even the table next to us noted how long our order was taking.   Overpriced, extremely slow, but quite a treat if you get the right burger.",

I ordered the classic burger with cheddar cheese and bacon and split the Campfire S'mores milkshake with my dining companion.  The shake was delicious and the alcohol taste was very subtle which I did not mind.  It comes with some extra in a tin container and was more than enough for the two of us to share.  I was disappointed though that some of the other shakes I wanted to try were only seasonal.     As we were waiting I noticed popcorn being brought out to another table twice.  I had to ask for some after seeing that and our server acted surprised that none had been brought out.  Hmm, wasn't it his job to do it or at least see to it that we got some and didn't he look at our table and see that we had none?  By the time our popcorn was brought out our burgers came out a minute later, so we didn't get to enjoy too much of the popcorn.   We were debating as to whether we should split a burger or get our own and in the end we each got our own because from what we could see they looked pretty small.  Turned out we actually could have split one and it would have been enough for the two of us.  Personally that would have been fine for me because I wasn't too thrilled with the burger and have definitely had better.  I usually do not mind pickles in my burger but theirs just did not taste good and I had to pick them out.  The other greens in my burger did not taste good either.  To top it all off I asked for my burger to be cooked well done and it came out pink inside.  My burger came with shoestring fries which were ok.  They were super skinny so at the end of the meal it looked like I hadn't even touched them.    If you are looking for a good burger and fries at the Cosmopolitan I highly recommend the burger at Commes Ca, truly some of the best burgers and fries I've had and for about the same price as what you'd get at Holstein's.  Come to Holstein's for the shakes, but just make sure they currently have the flavor you've been wanting to try.",

I did not end up getting a buzz or anything but hayy youre in sin city so why not treat yourself?  I ordered the Hen House burger with steak cut fries and the Drunken Monkey shake. I was more than satisfied and it was more than enough food. The burgers are big so be prepared to open wide! They are also extremely large so *clap clap* if you finish it all. The shake was delicious too! Im happy the waitress suggested the drunken monkey to me or else I would have fallen back on a classic oreo shake.... which I wouldnt have minded either :)",

A manager type guy came by and said our waiter would be right with us.  Then he came by again and asked if he could get our drink order.  I thought that was great, but then it seemed to take awhile to get our drinks.    Beer selection was very good and reasonably priced.  B/f got the sliders, which he liked.  I had the kobe and potato chip burger which was very good.  Also had the shoestring fries, which I liked but would probably choose the steak-cut next time.  We only had to wait a little while for a table but the bar area is weird because you can't stand by the bar because the people in the booths in the bar area (which are really low) then yell at you for blocking the tv.  So that's odd.  Also, the servers wear clothing with suggestive slogans such as \"nice buns\" or \"I eat meat\" on them, so if you find that kind of provocative attire offensive, you might want to head across the street to the Harley Davidson Cafe, just sayin'.",

The buffalo chicken dip was really good (or was it good bc I was starving??) and my husband said his burger was pretty decent. the atmosphere was cool and it was in my hotel which is why it gets 3 stars.

I went here for lunch this past Saturday to find a hair in my food. Absolutely disgusting. I didn't make a scene and was polite about it as I know things happen, assuming the situation would be remedied. After waiting for my new hairless plate and finishing my meal, I was stunned to see that there was nothing taken off my check, especially after the manager knew what had happened. I asked for the manager and told him POLITELY that I would not expect to pay full price when my meal had hair in it and I had to wait until my friend was finished with her food until I got mine. His response was \"I tell you what, I'll give you a 15% locals discount.\" Really? Do the locals also generally get hair in their food? I thought the situation was handled very poorly and I will never return to Holsteins.",

    "text": "We were so looking forward to Holsteins for the burger fix we had been delaying for weeks before our visit to Vegas. So when we arrived at Cosmo, we headed up to Holsteins on the 2nd floor on a Sunday evening and walked to the hostess desk at check in.   From the get go I already had a predetermination that we weren't going to get the friendliest girls to check in with. I figure, put your tasks aside, and greet your f'in customer. At least acknowledge them immediately. Ok, so maybe it was that bad- she took my name, gave me the pager, and told me it will be just a few with a semi-courteous attitude. So we walked around out front a bit, I went over to the bar across the way and picked up a brew, went back to have a seat outside the restaurant. Then I noticed my pager was chirping. This wasn't the typical light up and vibrate situation we're all used to when they are paging us to check in. This was an intermittent chirp, no lights, as if it was possibly telling me the battery was running low. I don't know! So I got up, stopped inside to inquire about, or let the hostess know (she was the same one who helped me just like seven minutes prior) the pager, and she acted like if I was freshly coming in for the first time. (mind you I had the pager held up to the hostess desk... And my beer in my other hand) The first words out of her mouth, so directly were, \"I'm sorry! No outside drinks in here\". That tripped me out and I told her about the pager chirping... \"Well, it will light up when it's ready\". I was like, ya I knew that I decided she can go F herself, I'll just wait a bit more.   So ok. We were paged, checked in, asked to meet the hostess down in the middle... She was a little more personable. So we sat, and sat... Well it was longer than it should have been. Got our popcorn :D, my beer, her coke, waitress was pretty nice... Told me the Rising Sun Burger I just placed my order for was the house favorite (Thanks Yelp!). It wasn't until she checked in on us, and at which I inquired about the plate I ordered when she got all defensive. I'm sorry, but I just couldn't recall if my burger had a fried egg on it or not. Thanks to all the photos on Yelp! Excuse me if I got confused. She proceeded to say things like, \"Well did you order one?\", \"Did you want one?\" As I explained this to her, she just kind of gave me the stink eye and walked away. That is why you didn't receive a tip missy. Sorry if that ruined your day.  But with that said, the hostesses walking around acting like they were directing air traffic with their little radios and smug looks on their face... Holsteins, food maybe be packed full of flavor, possibly a little under portioned, you need to give your staff a lesson in attitude...   When we visit Vegas, we drop money, lots of it. I don't care if your trendy or haute... Service is what bring the clients back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place a higher rating than I did. Read so many outstanding reviews, but maybe they were just having a bad day. Still a great outstanding restaurant shouldn't have bad days they should be consistent considering these reviews.   Well here's my opinion...I ordered the big fat Greek which consisted of course of the lamb burger, feta cheese, thaziki sauce, and lettuce. First let's start off with the lamb cooked medium rare please as i stated to the waiter. The waiter had informed me the cook did not like cooking it that way so I said ok medium. No biggie as long as I had the beautiful pinkness in the middle. So as I got my burger it was cooked to well done!!! Wtf. The feta cheese and sauce tasted weird.  The bun tasted cardboardish. Ewww! The waiter came back and saw how my burger was cooked he was nice enough to apologize and explained to me how the chef really does not like to undercook the lamb. Um ok opposed to overcooking the crap out of it. What a damn shame!! Worst lamb burger. I had a better tasting lamb at mad Greek. Lol! But this does not even hold a candle to black hog in Los Angeles. Best lamb burger by far there. So let's continue I ordered my side of shoestring fries. It came in a cute mini silver looking pail/bucket. So gross it was so freaking hard. And you know when you eat hard crunchy salty potatoes it kind of leaves the upper roof of your mouth raw and beat up.  I know I wasn't the only one complaining about my meal, bc the girls at the next table complained to our waiter that their burger was burnt!!! Really people!? Please reevaluate this chef dude and figure out why he is overcooking the meat and the fries. Yucky!!!   Now about the service the waiter was nice but didn't refill our drinks once... And the tables around us were complaining asking where's our waiter. It wasn't even crazy busy either. It died down in the middle of our meal.   Wow. Now thinking about this review three stars is way too generous. Well I will leave it to three stars due to the awesome artsy stuff on the walls. Love the decor and interior design. That part was dope. If it was based only on food and service alone 2 stars. Step up your game HOLSTEINS! Not good grub folks.",

The fries, however, were blech: mushy yet oddly over-cooked.  A few things really soured our experience:  1. Total a-hole a the next table--can't be helped.  2. Our waitress was great (even after said a-hole PUNCHED her \"accidentally\" and didn't apologize!) The food runners, however, were a different story: They had no idea who ordered what (my pet peeve), and when one of the orders was wrong, suggested snarkilly that my friend should just eat that instead. Then made a rude comment as he threw down a salad and stomped off.  3. The bar servers are walking around in their underwear. Yay, you might say. Degrading to women, I might respond. While this is a \"fun\" restaurant, it was a bit much, and kinda out of place. Where were the male servers? Lawsuit much? Didn't Hooters have this problem?",

    "text": "Went to Cosmo to watch Polica rock out at the Boulevard Pool last night (buy their album! review w/in a review).   I always like to try out a new restaurant in whatever casino I'm seeing a concert in (or in the case of the Cosmo I include Aria's options).   Since I splurged a little with Julian Serrano a few weeks back, I thought we should take it easier on our bank accounts with Holsteins.  This wasn't seen as a downgrade in my eyes too much because I'd been wanting to try their Gold Standard Burger ever since I'd read John Curtas praise it as (one of?) the best in Las Vegas.  Given the fact that one of their signature milkshakes would probably cause me death due to my lactose intolerance (and not a quick, lethal injection/firing squad death which might make it worth it, but more of a slow, chinese water torture/buried alive death) I passed on those, though they sure sounded delicious.  I instead opted for my usual Jack and Coke which was an acceptable version, but not as strong as I normally prefer.  For food we skipped appetizers because the majority seemed fried or slathered with cheese and or some sort of ranch dressing (I know, it's a burger joint) and I just didn't feel like I needed any of that before I gorged on a giant burger and fries along with the whole slow death sentence thing.  I ordered the Gold Standard with no altering of the standard fixings cooked medium, and shoestring fries on the side.  Shortly thereafter the burger arrived and looked delectable and consisted of a Dry Aged Sirloin patty, nice smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese (goat cheese tends to sit easier with my intolerance in case nosy minds were inquiring), tomato confit (I had to google confit to remind myself what it was.   I already forgot.  Roasted?), and arugula and some garlic aioli.   The burger was perfectly cooked, and I really enjoyed every bite of it.   I do think that there might have been too many flavors going on which took away from the quality of the beef.  I'm not sure it really needs the aioli or maybe it needs less, and the cheese tasted really nice, but I felt like it may have overpowered the whole thing a little.  I'm being very nitpicky as it was a tasty burger as Sam Jackson would say, but all in all I still prefer almost any I've had at Bachi or Fuku burger and they are more reasonably priced.   The fries were very average and had zero qualities worth mentioning here which was a bit of a disappointment.   Service was friendly and responsive for the entire meal, if not a little robotic seeming at times.  I can live with that for an $80 dinner and drinks for 2 at the casino where the table minimums are my monthly salary.",

    "text": "Overall the restaurant is very nice and lively. The service is great, and the decor is everything moo. We went on a thursday afternoon and there was no line. The burgers were flavorful, although the patties were a little more cooked than we asked for--so if you want medium, then ask for medium rare. Also, the fries were a little soggy, so I would definitely recommend the onion rings.",

    "text": "The atmosphere is really cool, lots of original burger (cow) inspired comic art on the walls and great tufted leather couches around thick butcher block tables.  The booze shakes are a good way to enjoy a milkshake without slowing down on the drinking in Vegas.  Service is decent.  A great beer selections of craft ales from east and west coast, domestics, and rotating handles.  The great: The burgers buns, the onion rings, and the pizza flavored popcorn they bring before your meal.  The not so great:  Cold and gummy thin cut fires that are lacking, burger patties are nicely seasoned but a medium cooked burger was still quite rare, the meat hadn't cooked enough to hold its shape and it was a bit bloody.  It's hard to judge based on the price when you are in Vegas but with $9 draft beer pints and $16+ we expect a little more.  We have been to Holsteins several times before and we will probably eat there in the future.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the atmosphere. In particular, the entrance area seating next to the bar was unique and comfortable for a drink. As an area for eating, I hated crouching over to eat the burger.   I ordered the Steakhouse Burger (medium) with a side of sweet potato fries. The flavorful and tasty burger was cooked to order as I requested. I definitely enjoyed every last bite of the burger.   The sweet potato fries were okay. The shoestring fries came in a small bucket, which was indicative of the flavor. The sweet potato fries had a slight sweet potato flavor, but they were too small to really appreciate. I really love sweet potatoes so i was pretty excited to try them. In the end, I was disappointed.   The menu was reasonably priced for the food. I wouldn't suggest eating here if you plan on going to the clubs/bars after dinner. The food is extremely filling. Overall, the burgers are worthy of eating. I definitely plan on returning here when I am back in Las Vegas.",

I had a cake martini and it was delicious.  Loved the sprinkles around the rim.  Once seated for dinner the waiter suggested the Gold Standard as it was fairly popular and it didn't disappoint.  One of the best burgers I've ever had, actually.  I split this with my boyfriend along with an order of sweet potato fries and onion rings.  Everything was good and service was friendly.  It is the Strip so the menu is priced accordingly.",

    "text": "Update 8/20: Here's a message I received from Ashley R., who I suspect to be an employee of Holsteins. I've censored the expletive from the note.  \"It's cause ur Asian and u won't tip good even if u got good service, so f--- off\"  Something management and potential customers should be well aware of and perhaps provide Miss Ashley with an English course. Cause = A person or thing that gives rise to an action, phenomenon, or condition  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!  I had the Gold Standard burger which was EXCELLENT even though overpriced but I can not give this place more than 1 star due to the horrible service.  After sitting down our server took about 5 minutes to come greet us, which is understandable being it was busy. In a rush, we had our order ready and she walked away with our order. 10 minutes go by and we are not yet served our drinks. Finally our drinks come and the burger hits the table. But, we didn't have our silverware yet! So the food runner brought us silverware since our waitress was no where to be found. During our meal the waitress never came to check if our burger was good. Not once!   After we were finished eating we sat around for about 10-15 minutes waiting with empty water glasses to ask for the check. Our waitress was no where to be found!  We asked the host to grab our waitress for the check and we saw him walk over to the center of the restaurant to look for her. Another 10 minutes go by and he couldn't find her. At this point, I walked up to the bar and asked if I could pay my bill there but unfortunately I couldn't.   Another 10 minutes go by and we see the host finally find our waitress. She drops the check off after 5 minutes and I hand it right back to her with a card. We watch her go take a drink order from another table and come back with the drinks for that table.. But, she didn't have our check ready! Another 5 minutes go by and the waitress is no where to be seen. At this point we are extremely frustrated and demand to see a manager. After speaking with the manager, she brings us the check and does not even apologize.   All in all the experience took over an hour and we only saw our server twice. Once to take our order and another after we requested our check through the host. Will never visit this place again.",

At the end of the meal the only items we enjoyed most was the onion rings, fries and the popcorn. The seasoning on the popcorn is really good. We wanted to asked for more. Hehe.

All Yelpers are aware of the must-go (cheap) Vegas eats (Raising Cane's, Hash House, Earl of Sandwich and of course, Burger Bar), and I'm happy to say that Holstein's can join that list.  Although my Kobe Beef Burger (The Rising Sun) ran me about $17 bucks, it was welllll worth it. It was topped with Tempura Avocado, Spicy Mayo, Crispy Sweet Potatoes, Furikake & Teriyaki Glaze...can you say yum??! My burger was cooked to medium perfection and it came with a side of thick, seasoned wedge fries.   I love the variety on the menu as well. This place boasts Spiked Milkshakes, DIY Burgers, Mini Hotdogs, Chicken & Waffles and many different burger creations. I was torn between my Kobe Beef Burger and the \"Big Fat Greek\" which was a Lamb Burger topped with Feta & Tzatziki sauce, mmmm!   Definitely a place to check out, especially if you don't want to go alllll the way to Mandalay Bay to eat at Burger Bar. Holstein's is a must for burger enthusiasts :)  Quick tips: -Located on the 2nd floor along with the Chandelier Bar and across from Marquee -Complimentary garlic/cheese infused popcorn -Friendly service -Awesome atmosphere!!",

    "text": "Met a friend here for apres-work dinner and a couple of beers. I was happy to see that they actually have a vegan burger on the menu!  I pretty much agree with fellow Yelper Jen. F's opinion. The burger was fine, a little mushy, served with avocado, cucumbers and lettuce (they didn't offer sprouts when I went). The burger was fine, but not mind-blowing. Got the shoestring fries - which were awesome.  Sampled the Holsteins Special Lager - which the waitress said was like \"Bud Light\". Personally, I think that description does it no justice. Nice crisp, lager with a fairly low alcohol content.  Good beer for washing down a heavy meal with a drive home ahead of you.  The service was attentive - our waitress was friendly and professional. The hostess seemed a bit glum, maybe she was having a bad day.",

    "text": "SPOILER ALERT  This.  Place.  Sucks.  --  Ok well they only kind of suck because I did enjoy my milkshake and the awesome steak fries, but everything else was a HUGE disappointment especially my burger.  I guess my beef with Holsteins (pun intended) was that my burger came out almost well done when I ordered it medium rare.  Yeah I should have sent it back but I was STARVING and didn't want to get an extra topping in my burger if you know what I mean.  So I scarfed it down and here I am now on Yelp LOL!    And it doesn't stop there. I also had the absolute WORST lobster roll of my life here.  In fact, I wouldn't even consider it a lobster roll, more like a little bit of lobster inside a huge untoasted unbuttered cold stale roll with bbq marks as if it was on the grill trying to pass itself off as a lobster roll, so do me a favor y'all actually do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER this unless of course you want a little more disappointment in your life, because if that's what you need then by all means have at it...  Yeah it looks nice and they have cool art an shit to confuse your taste buds, but the truth of the matter is I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, even someone I didn't like.  You're better off gambling your money away or spending it on booze or strippers or giant guitar shaped margaritas or ziplining on Fremont Street.  Hell for the price I paid here I think I could have gotten a day pass for ziplining, which I promise you would have been a whole helluva lot more enjoyable than anything here (except for the milkshakes).",

    "text": "O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D.   I don't really understand how this place is supposed to have the best burgers in all of Vegas. Vegas must really lack good burgers.  The ambiance is kind of weird - resembling a lounge/club in the front bar area and almost like an Applebee's in the back dining room. Well, an Applebee's with Japanese style cartoon cows on the walls.   Burgers here are really just mediocre at best. My veggie burger was mushy and didn't taste of the \"12 veggies\" the server proclaimed went into the patty at all! I have had a handful of great veggie burgers elsewhere, sometimes at a fraction of the price. Their veggie patty really tasted no different from a Garden burger (you know, the frozen kind).   Okay, I'm sure you're laughing now about how I'm whining about the quality of a burger joint when I had the nerve to order a freaking veggie burger. Well, the oh-so popular \"rising sun\" burger the bf ordered wasn't too impressive either. Not only was the patty cooked to an almost well done when he specifically asked for medium rare, but the plethora of sweet Japanese BBQ sauce and various toppings totally overwhelmed the meat and was excessively salty, even for him! The one thing I did really enjoy was the sweet potato fries I ordered with my veggie burger, but I have rarely met a sweet potato fry that I didn't like.  The concept of Holstein's is pretty cool I guess, definitely fun and laid-back. However, they need to deliver on the execution. I would much rather save my calories for another restaurant, or just a few beers.",

    "text": "This place is a hit or miss as for experience dining inside.  I can't deny that their burgers are delicious but depending on what time and server you get, your experience will depend on service.  I came to Holsteins a couple of times and the first time was great. Good service, good waiters and good food. The second time I came, it was horrrrrrrible!! The food was good as always. But the service was just terrible! The thing that angered me the most is that it was only our table receiving such bad service. We see others receiving their food promptly and watching the managers check up on them but when the manager came across our table, he straight turned away and ignored us!!! Didn't even ask if we were doing alright. Which we weren't! We waited forever to get our food and the waiter was pretty much non-existent to us! It took forever to get his attention and we even waited forever for our check even when we asked for it.  The third time, we learned better so we decided to order togo and eat in our rooms. That way, we don't have to deal with inconsistent service.  Anyways, as for the food. Definitely try the billionaire burger. Hey, you're in Vegas so go big or go home! The foie gras is perfectly seared and so flavorful and the combination of the onions and truffle sauce is sooo good! So worth the price! Only $28! If you want something a little bit reasonable, the rising sun, the fun-ghi and el machete are all delicious as well!   It's surprisingly a good burger joint and is a must try if you're staying in Cosmo!",

    "text": "What's not to like about great burgers and even better shakes (especially when you can get them with alcohol in them). Holsteins is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and just like the hotel has quite the vibe to it. There is open seating in the bar area but if you get there early enough you can get a seat in the dining area.   Typically when I have friends in town, we seem to end up at Holsteins (either because they want to try it or they are staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel). Either way, it's a great way to enjoy some pretty good burgers (but be prepared to spend a bit of money as the prices are definitely not that inexpensive).  There is definitely a large selection of alcoholic beverages that you can choose from, but I definitely recommend the adult shakes that they have. Between my friends and I we tried the Drunken Monkey, Oreo, and Cereal Bowl (tastes just like Captain Crunch). For burgers, we've tried quite a few of the different burgers - The Classic, The Longhorn (with beef brisket as well), The Rising Sun (asian flavors with teriyaki sauce), The Fun-Ghi (with assorted mushrooms), the El Machete (with an anaheim chili - sounds spicy, but it really is not, it's good, but it could use some more spice), and of course, the Billionaire Burger (kobe beef patty with foie gras). The Billionaire burger is what a lot of people like to try (especially those from California that can't get their foie gras anymore. You can also add a fried egg to your burger (which I recommend) - just to make it even more tasty with another layer of flavor.  The burgers also come with either shoestring or steak cut fries. I have ordered a side salad (to try and be a little healthier - although not by much since we were indulging in a burger), and was disappointed that they charged $2 extra dollars for the substitution of a side salad over the fries (and it wasn't even a large salad). I guess next time I'll just indulge in the fries.  Overall, a great place to hang out with your friends, get some good burgers and have a lot of drinks. I'd definitely recommend enjoying the Billionaire Burger at least once.",

    "text": "Yes that's right 5 stars and there are valid reasons why. During the MLK weekend my friends and I entered a Dodgeball tournament in Sin City.  We rested and decided to go out to dinner. One of my friends heard and read great reviews of Holstein's and I am not to argue with a person that knows her food. When we finally arrive we are quickly seated to our table where our waitress (wish I knew her name) welcomed us and provided menus (like any restaurant would). What I enjoyed was the excellent customer service she provided and excellent knowledge of the preparation of the meals.  I went for the Steakhouse burger because it looked simple, filling, and juicy (yes juicy). I do not remember what my friends orders, but let me continue. We ordered some onion rings which were very delicious. Crunchy, not burnt nor mushy. When our meal arrived I took some time to take in the smell and here is where I begin to drool over its scent. When I took a bite of that burger the follow filled my mouth. My palate were swimming with some much flavor of that first bite. Once I was finishing up that bite a burst of the crushed black peppers kicked in and I had to take another moment savoring that bite.  Most times we expect that first bite to be the only one that gives that satisfaction of a good meal, but not for me the taste continued and kept getting better and better. The bun held out quite well. I doubt it was because I was eating the food quick (which I was not), but it managed to hold its own and added to the steak.  On my last day in Vegas my road trip buddy and I were considering on coming back before hitting the long road back to Los Angeles.   This is one place I recommend everyone to try out. Yes it is pricy but it is well worth it.  Thanks again.",

The lobster roll was good along with the sweet potato fries. The Rising Sun burger was slightly on the salty side and the regular fries were just okay - kinda soggy. The bam-boozled Tiramisu shake was delicious along with the truffle lobster mac n cheese. Overall an ok spot to eat but the burger I had was just so-so. Maybe we'll give them another shot when we're in Vegas and try something else other than the Rising Sun.",

While the Gold Standard was really not my favorite (misled by the bartender...), mostly because the aged goat cheddar cheese overwhelmed all the other flavors, the Rising Sun was the bomb diggity!  I chose to add a fried egg to the Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado goodness that made up this burger....perfect mixture of flavors and textures.  The fries were just typical, nothing special really with the shoe string or sweet potato fries.   I'm a big fan of really just this Rising Sun burger...I don't know if I would frequent this place all the time since the burgers are a little pricey.   Definitely comparable to the Bachi Burger concept....but I think I may prefer Bachi over this place....especially given the price point and the options for fries are better at Bachi.",

I had the chicken fingers and natural cut fries, and my hubby had a burger and onion rings.. The fingers were very good( I am a super picky eater). My hubby was making the hmm hmm sound the whole time he are and the onion rings were fried perfectly and they didn't fall apart and leave you just eating the onion. The two HUGE ISSUES I had were with our bartender/ waitress who was nice and attentive BUT a little to much with my husband... It was like she took care of my needs as a customer but engage in convo with him, kept her eyes on him and when my hubby and I shared an inside joke that we shared, you told me.... Be nice..really?? Like I said we are locals and I have been a waitress, cocktail server and a blackjack dealer and I know the whole \" flirt a little\" deal but not with someone's husband. We both had our wedding rings on and we were affectionate. I think she should be careful with that, I was kinda taken aback.. We ate, food was good but I will never go back to that restaurant for that reason.",

The next night was the burger with the egg on it (don't recall the name). OMG they were good!  The rising sun was a bit better, but both were delicious.  Plus throw in an adult shake or two and you've got yourself a good thing.  Reminder: this is basically a burger joint, so it that's what you're looking and you're willing to spend a bit (it's not cheap), you'll love it.  Would absolutely go back.

Plus its cheaper. We had the Gold standard, Millionaires and the rising sun. All three were  so good but Im glad we decided to share. If you can share with somebody its the best way to choose. Our waitress was really nice and provided great service. I love staying at the Cosmo and cant wait to come back here over and over.",

    "text": "I'm not sure I've ever had worse service.  Can I give .25 stars?  Made a reservation 3 weeks ahead of super bowl and they called same day today of the super bowl and told us if we want a seat in front of the TV it's a $150 minimum. We complained that we were never advised of this when we made the reservation and at that hour we'd be scrambling for a viewing party.   The agreed to make it $100 for us.  When we got there the hostess made us wait because she said many tables have been booked for months so she wasn't sure which one we could have.  When we were finally sat we ordered red sangria. They said they were out. We then ordered bud light drafts and they were out of bud light on super bowl Sunday.  Service was slow, the food was cold, and the drinks were weak.   When we complained to the manager he said he had been complained to all day about the cover and if the customers were just mad that their team lost. I wasn't even wearing a jersey!!!  Instead of apologizing when I explained in a repeat customer who had poor service he said he would take the gratuity off the bill. I had to wait 40 minutes for an adjusted bill. I came to find I had already been charged the full amount instead of \"authing\" the card like the waitress indicated. So then I had to wait 4 days for the voided charges to come off. My advice to the owner is get a manager that respects customers and be better organized and shut off open table on days when you have events. Not only will I never come back, but I will also spread the word to friends, family and clients that frequent Vegas to stay away. Disappointing as we have been coming to Holsteins for years.",

The decor was really cute (I never comment on stuff like this, so the fact that it caught my eye means a lot). Burgers were pretty good, nothing off the charts amazing, but I'd go with the Rising Sun burger (Gold Standard was probably second best). Sides were somewhat overdone, but not terrible either. The savoir of this place was the milkshakes. DEAR GOD SO GOOD. 4 of us split the campfire smores and the raspberry lemon cheesecake, both were amazing. You knew there was alcohol in there, but the shakes weren't overpowered by the alcohol (or by the sugary stuff to cover up the booze) I'd definitely recommend this place, if for nothing else the milkshakes",

My first experience was at the bar where there were plenty of beers on tap.  The Honey Brown beer was actually really good.  The bar tender was extremely nice and gave me samples of two different beers before I picked one.  Then we sat down at the restaurant.  We were greeted with truffle butter popcorn courtesy of the chef and boy were they delicious.  Then I ordered the Kobe burger with fried avocado and yam with a spicy mayo sauce ($16).  This was a mighty juicy burger, but it's not as good as Burger Bar at the Mandalay Bay.  My friend ordered the duck fat fries and these were delicious with the aroma of the duck fat soaked into the fries.  My steak fries were not comparable.  We were too full to check the dessert out, but maybe next time.  Overall, a wonderful experience for a new burger joint and will return again if I visit the Cosmopolitan, although I will try out the other restaurants there before returning.  This is in between a 3-4 stars, but closer to 4 stars.",

Slightly pricey but you're paying to eat on the strip and this place has better standards when it comes to quality.

I am writing this review after the 2nd time coming here...forgive me...I am a very busy person with 2 crazy monkeys to raise...Yelp kinda takes a back seat.  I was lucky enough to come here a second time with my BESTEST FOODIE FRIEND, Rob M. (LL Cool Mack if you're nasty) for a belated birthday dinner (I told you I was a busy girl). It wasn't very crowded and we were seated right away. On our way back to our table I spotted the server we had last time...The lovely NOELLE. Noelle is what every server should aspire to be. She is knowledgeable, genuinely caring about your experience (my monkeys loved her) and an all around cool person. If you are smart you will trust her recommendations (she's batting for 1000 after 2 visits). We had the most amazing food: -New Belgium Hoptober beer -Lobster truffle mac n' cheese (a MUST...you will be licking the plate clean) -Mini sliders with beef tenderloin, fois gras, arugula, truffle mayo and a wild mushroom demi glaze (they are small but bursting with flavor) -The Gold Standard burger (what they are famous for...I can see why) -The Drunken Monkey adult milkshake (so tasty, not super boosy...even gave some to the monkeys. They loved it) -Maple glazed donuts with vanilla cream filling and bacon bits on top (holy cow I died and went to heaven).  Now the downside....this place isn't a fast food restaurant. Good food is worth the wait and you will wait a bit here. I appreciated the wait time in between courses so I could digest and really enjoy all my food. If you are in a hurry don't come here...you will be bummed. Also...its kinda pricey but well worth it in my mind. You are looking at around $60 per person depending on what you drink. If you can't afford it...don't eat here...simple as that.   I will be back soon and hopefully Miss Noelle will be our girl again.",

I hate when I go somewhere with so much on the menu that sounds really good and I end up basically wasting an opportunity by choosing something that ends up sucking. I'd say I'm about 6-1 here including appetizers, not a bad record. 4 1/2 stars for the food, -1/2 star for the terrible pork belly buns, and -1 star for price, especially the shakes (they add an undetectable amount of booze, and double the price). Gourmet burgers=fancy bar food, and a lot of bars are stepping up their game these days while still keeping their prices reasonable., even a few places on the strip. Just because a restaurant is in the cosmopolitan, doesn't magically elevate their product to the next level. Cosmopolitan restaurants are like SEC speed (you won't understand this if you're not a college football fan), their superiority is just a myth. IMO, the food at Holsteins is overpriced. If this place was across the street at Planet Hollywood, it would be 30% cheaper (unless they put \"Gordon Ramsey\" in the title).",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night about 9 ish with 2 friends. We couldn't find any place to eat without a long wait or prior reservations, so we popped a squat in the lounge area.   A cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.  We ordered simple little meals as follows: Red Stripe - $7 Dragon Fruit Drink - $10 Black and White Shake - $8 Artichoke Guacamole app with chips $9 Truffle Lobster $16.50 Pizza Twinkies $12 Mini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9  The Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top.  The Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.    The meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack.   I tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.",

I've had the Gold Standard and it is delicious. The garlic aioli complements the rest of the flavors particularly well. I had the fortunate luck of pairing it with a Hefe called Franziskaner my first time there and man oh man, I was in burger-beer heaven. I was in \"beerger\" heaven!!   This last time though I had the Big Fat Greek. It was great. Feta cheese and olive relish went great together, and I don't even like olives. If you knew my history with olives, you know I say \"F\" olives! But... the olive relish I guess is mixed in with the meat and there ended up being an olive pit in mine. It actually pierced my gums and caused some bleeding. Do not laugh!! It was quite unpleasant. And not even cause of the pit itself, but because I handed back the burger. I actually wanted to keep finishing it. Lol. But Ivan, the manager, was gracious and apologetic... he offered to comp my meal as well as replace my order. Well with a good burger like that I wasn't gonna say no.   Despite what happened it's not the worst dining experience I've had... not by a long shot. It was appropriately handled. But, had this incident not happened, I think I would still give them 4 stars. Their \"dessert\" menu consists of only shakes which I'm not a fan of unless I'm using it as mouthwash. And, though their burgers are really good, I think some are overpriced by a few $'s... oooooh say, 3 or 4. Even still, from time to time the price, as well as the trip across town, is worth it. I'll definitely keep coming back.",

In contrast to Gordon Ramsey's BurGr, this place is not as crowded.   I felt I had a lot of elbow space.  I sat at the counter, but there were nice comfy looking couches in the restaurant.    I ordered the \"Holstein Beef Tiny Buns\" with american cheese.  Basically 3 sliders.  I have had my share of sliders in the past, but these were well above average.  To paraphrase Harold and Kumar, \" those itty-bitty grilled onions that just explode in your mouth like flavor crystals every time you bite into one.\"   The fries were nothing special.    I see myself coming back to this place for a quick meal break after playing blackjack.",

    "text": "First of all, I want to start off by saying that the Cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don't get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can't stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, \"the best burgers in Vegas,\" and \"I Love Love Love Hoslteins\" were some of many glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.  The lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.  Upon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn't your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.  Quite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can't mess it up.  And now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn't have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a \"Kobe\" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn't any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn't help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn't make up for the overcooked patty.  If anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. \"You are in Vegas. Live a little!\", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.  Pretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can't associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn't think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.",

It has a good combo of sauce to onions and a juicy Kobe beef. Our medium request came out more like medium well, but still surprisingly very juicy nonetheless.

For lunch, I decided to try out Holsteins, which is located right outside Marquee of Cosmopolitan.    The restaurant atmosphere and decor was wonderful. There is a bar area. Lounge area with big chairs and couches. Inside were tables and booths.  Food:  All the burgers looked good. I ordered the Rising Sun. Fried avocado, a south Asian sesame dressing with julienne carrots, spicy mayo, burger cooked medium. Comes with steak wedges or shoestring fries but instead, $2 for sweet potato. The burger was great! Perfect portion, and fried avocado did it for me.   Service: Services could have been better with more attention on guests, quicker refill on water, and corrected orders. My friend's burger was cooked too well however, the server took it back and brought over a new one.    Overall, I loved the atmosphere. I loved the food. AND I loved the company. The price is a little pricey though. 15+",

My friend and I ordered two burgers and cut them in half so we could try both. The Gold Standard burger and the mushroom burger tasted mostly the same. The fries were more or less average and the onion rings exactly average.

We looked at the workers and all the waitresses had to wear booty shorts and knee high socks. One of the waitress, a black chic, her shorts were so high that literally half her ass was showing. It was kind of disturbing. But I guess they were trying to keep it classy? Lol. So what did I do? I sat down and just put my purse on my thighs. No one noticed, problem solved.

One of the best kobe beef burgers I've had. The fries were pretty good too, asked to have it crispy though.

To begin with, the hostesses were very polite and we only had to wait for about ten minutes and they had the option to send a text when the table was ready, allowing us to take a look around the shops located nearby.  Once we were seated, we ordered the Truffle Lobster Mac n Cheese and it was incredible. My girlfriend and I fought over the last few bites.  I ordered the Rising Sun burger, cooked medium and I added a fried egg. My girlfriend had the Gold Standard cooked the same with a fried egg as well. Suffice to say, she had major food envy, and after trying hers I could understand. The Rising Sun was in the Top 5 greatest burgers I've ever had.   The service was great, the atmosphere was very cool, and it wasn't too loud like other restaurants like it. I highly recommend",

From the creatively named menu items, to the overly fake-eyelashed waitresses, Holsteins really tries to grab your attention.  As for the food and service at this place... Meh. I had ordered the turkey burger and a side salad with dressing on the side. When I started eating my burger, I noticed that there was a small white square on my lettuce. The little white square was an expiration sticker that the chef had forgotten to take-off my lettuce leaf before sending the food out. The waitress was unapologetic, but the manager did come over to say he was sorry. Once the food was re-prepared and delivered to my table, the chef had drenched my salad in dressing. I hate being 'one of those customers', but I had to send my salad back to the kitchen. Again, no apology from the waitress.  The burger itself was just okay. There was nothing to write home about on the flavor of the meat, bun, or side salad. I've had better elsewhere.  While I don't expect my meal to be comped, I did expect something more once I informed the waitress that there was a sticker on my food. Nope, I paid full price for my disappointing meal.  Being a local in Vegas, I have my pick of the litter when it comes to burger joints. Holsteins is a place I don't believe I would visit again.",

This time I had the Hen House (burger with fried egg). SO GOOD. And this time took a chance with the alcoholic milkshakes. I had the \"Birthday Cake\" (appropriately), which had cake-flavored vodka. Did you know cake-flavored vodka existed? NEITHER DID I!!!! The roomie had Captain Crunch, which, yes, has bits of Cap'n Crunch cereal in it.  The staff was amazing and friendly, even more than usual. It was a busy Friday night, with the Rodeo in town and Marquee getting ready to open for the night, but the servers made our table feel like the most important one. They even brought out jello shots for our table AND desserts for my birthday!  I can't say enough great things about Holsteins. For the dollar, the atmosphere, and the food, it ranks in my opinion as the best restaurant at the Cosmopolitan.",

Whether it's the disgraceful customer service, the trashy clientele, the pathetic excuse for pool attendants-- it all sucks. So when my cousin asked us to meet her and her parents here, I was crazy skeptical. I was honestly just gonna grab a coke and eat somewhere else later. I'm so glad I didn't. I had the \"Gold Standard\" burger with Onion rings and it was, by far, the best burger I've ever had. My mom had the classic with regular fries and we both spilt an order of the fried pickles (which were also, the best I've ever had). For both of us the check came out to $63. I would have paid twice that much for a burger of that quality. Seriously just amazing. If you love a good In-n-Out burger, you'll love this place. They put \"Umami Burger\" to shame and need to be in a category all to themselves. I can't wait to eat here again.",

I went here with a friend  for dinner - both of us were tired of big meals and wanted a simple hamburger. Well - we got the hamburger. Simple, not so much. And thank the maker for that!  First off, we were greeted by enthusiastic and energetic table staff who proceeded to tell us about the menu and why Holsteins is a step above the rest. We decided to follow the waitress' recommendation and go with the signature burger, the Gold Standard (Gold Standard Burger: dry aged beef burger, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli). The chef has won awards for this burger. And you can easily see why.  Fries that came with the hamburger were over salty, but the table staff were quick to remedy the situation.  Both my colleague and I left saying that that was one of the best hamburgers we remember eating.   A bit pricey, but worth the money!",

For a place that boasts their buns and shakes, I expect them to be amazing! And sadly those were the two things I liked least about the place  I ordered the Ahi sliders and the flavors of the slider were great. Really fresh and my favorite part was the slaw on the inside. But what killed these sliders for me were the BUNS! The buns were cold, tough, and chewy. I was expecting some soft succulent warm buns to sink my teeth into, but these tasted like day old bread.  Now onto the shakes: I ordered the Black cow shake which was an \"udder\" fail. It was supposed to be a play on a vanilla coke float and what I got was a flat soda with some vanilla ice cream. The soda was so flat it just tasted like I was drinking coke flavored syrup. Yuck. Maybe you'll have some luck with some of the other shakes  All in all, it might have been an off day for Holstein's but I'm not willing to empty out my wallet again to give them a second chance.",

    "text": "As soon as I got to Vegas, the GF and I were starving so we met up with my friend (fellow yelper!) and went down to Holsteins as per his recommendation! We went there around 3-4ish during a football game so it was relatively busy. We had to wait a short time and were immediately seated. The first thing is that we were sitting there for about 15-20 minutes of absolutely no service. I flagged down one waitress to address the issue which she said she would resolve. Another 10 minutes pass and I had to flag down another bus boy which he actually went to our waiter and had him take our order. I understand that the restaurant was busy but 30 minutes without any attention to a table is quite absurd, especially for Vegas status!  When the waiter finally arrived, we ordered the Smoking Passion float and a Artichoke Guac to start. Holsteins is known to have their spiked shakes and we had to try one. The smoking passion float came with 2 mango meringues that were made in front of us with liquid nitrogen hence the name \"Smoking\" Passion float. The shake itself was so sweet that the taste of any alcohol was absent from our taste buds. The Artichoke Guac was a meaty starter with some nice spiced pita chips. It was a great way to start off our meal with some sweetness from the shake and some savoriness from the dip.  For our entree, the GF and I split a nomnom burger with a side of steak fries. The nomnom burger was cooked to perfection (Medium) and the steak fries were great. Although the steak fries did remind of a better quality version of potato wedges from KFC.   Overall my eating experience was great, the initial waiting experience did turn me off about this place and my friend assured me that this was the first time that this kind of service happened. I'm sure I will come here again but I'm hoping that this waiting game doesn't having again.",

As a matter of fact, there was no salt and pepper even on the table.  Everything was seasoned perfectly.  Alex, our server was spot on.  He was fast and his attention to detail was amazing.  We ordered the longhorn (delish) and my mom and I split the classic with Gruyere cheese.  Loved the fact they had a variety of specialty cheeses to choose from to add to the delight of a wonderful experience.  A small charge for the upgraded cheeses but well worth it.  The burgers come with fries.  We also had the onion rings.  Crispy and packed with flavor.  All items were killer.  The rings best I've had.  We all left very happily thrilled with our meals and stuffed.  Oh, I forgot to include their specialty, complementary  popcorn.  Not sure what the spices were but loved it and wanted to ask for a plastic bag to go.  Our total bill was under $45 not including gratuity. Holsteins is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  Don't miss it!  You'll be sorry!",

Ok, so I didn't spend the $28, but instead opted for the $16.5 peppered burger. Still expectations are a bit high.  I order medium rare and I end up with a medium done burger and my wife gets the medium rare burger when she wanted medium. Obviously, they don't pay too much attention to the fine details and got the orders swapped.The wedge cut fries did turn out pretty good, but the string cut fries were way too overcooked.   As a appetizer, we ordered the IPswitch clams and they pretty horrible. The batter was hard and it took some serious chomping just to bite through it. Geez, where these yesterday's leftovers and re-cooked today?  One of the best things is that I received a free draft lager with a Foursquare checkin.  One of the reasons we were there was because of a groupon deal.  Bottom line, this place is not a destination place for a great burger, but rather a place to eat while your at a chic hotel.   $6.50 for a Sierra Nevada pale ale...really!!!",

If you're a tourist, spending your vacation budget, the price is inline with your expectations.  But for locals, Five Guys and In-and-Out make great burgers in lieu of full service and \"ambiance\" at a great price.  Some of the ingredients are higher end like aged beef, goat cheese, kobe, and blue cheese.  These ingredients are very tasty, but do they really make for an extraordinary burger, especially for the price.    The fries both sweet and steak were goo.  The shakes (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are wonderful, but great drinks are a given in Vegas.  Lastly, When I'm paying my money for food at a restaurant, I expect my reasonable request to be fulfilled.  Since my friend and I couldn't decide between the same two burgers, I ordered one and she ordered the other.  We asked to have them cut in half so we could each try both.  The waitress said that she was not allow to do that.    Why the hell not?",

Unfortunately, my first experience here was quite disappointing. I yelped Holstein's Shakes and Buns & decided to give it a try after seeing it was given 4 stars.   We came here on the Sunday of Halloween weekend & were glad that the wait wasn't that long. Our waitress kindly informed us about their \"special\" shakes (which i thought was unique to their establishment). I ordered the Gold Standard, which our waitress said they were most famous for. The burger LOOKED really good, but as I bit into the burger, I quickly realized that the patty was very bland. They had cooked it the way I wanted, but there was just no flavor whatsoever in the patty. My appetite disappeared soon after as I found it hard to even eat the french fries. Our waitress seemed to have disappeared for a while as well.   Perhaps my taste buds were off that day from all the drinking the two nights before, but my meal just wasn't appetizing to me. Based on my first try here at Holsteins, I don't believe that they deserve the 4 stars. I am, however willing to give them another try & order something that would better appeal to my taste. I'm HOPING after that, I could also consider this fine establishment a 4 star restaurant.",

    "text": "As a widely traveled burger aficionado I have to say the burgers here are among the best. Top quality beef cooked to perfection, it's nice to see medium come with pink in it! I'm a minimalist when it comes to burgers, meat cheese and a bun, I want to taste the beef! That said I've tried the Gold Standard, The Steakhouse and the Nom Nom burgers here and all have great flavor combinations that still allow the flavor of the beef to be savored. The rest of the menu has some interesting looking items I hope to try if I ever  can resist ordering another burger, the Cuban Street Tacos and Truffle Lobster Mac N Cheese are very tempting. And of course don't forget to try a shake, yummy yummy goodness in a glass.  Remember it's Vegas if you come at peak times your probably going to wait but the best things in life are worth a little wait, right? Along the same train of thought the servers are going to be moving fast during the peak hours be patent, it's a virtue. And if you sit at the bar look for Bridgot, great service and amazing blue eyes! BTW she highly recommends the Teriyaki burger with an egg.",

The desk staff and bartenders are dressed more business like while the waitresses look like they came from Hooters. I was in the mood for a burger so I tried their Little Buns which were 3 slider sized burgers with onions ketchup and cheese. Great burger. Cooked just right and had nice hearty flavor. I also got a Frozen Grasshopper milk shake since I love mint. Got it non alcoholic which saved 3 bux but was still pricey at $8. Worth it tho. The bartender originally took it to the wrong table. The people there said it looked so good they decided to order it as well. I got there right after  they opened. By 12pm it was filling up so it's pretty popular. I definitely recommend this place.",

Mind you it was 11pm, the restaurant closes at 12am and the dining room was basically empty. We had to sit in the bar and try to eat our food off low tables while seated in high chairs. Keep in mind I've eaten here at least 40 times and never had this experience before. Our server was excellent. We complained to her and she agreed with us. She summoned the mgr \"Curtis\" who was less then helpful. He said the hostess was wrong and said it would never happen again. He also told us he would discount our bill for the inconvenience including my wife's burger dripping all over her due to the seating design. So when we received the bill we got a whopping 15% off. Wow what should i buy first! Curtis couldn't have cared less about our frustration. I told him I'd fire her if she worked for me but who needs to included in that firing is him. Disgraceful conduct by both.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to trying Holstein's since reading an article on their unique and exceptional desserts. I finally got there last night, and boy was I excited. I'd read positive reviews and food suggestions earlier in the day so I knew exactly what I wanted. To my surprise, it was dinnertime on Friday and we got seated right away. There were several open tables, but the hostess seated us at one of the smallest tables in the restaurant...and the top of it wobbled when we moved our arms. My husband ordered a $6 root beer and I got the $11 cereal bowl shake. My husband's glass was dirty and he asked to exchange it with a clean one...no apology, but at least the 2nd glass was clean. My shake was good, but I couldn't taste the flavored vodka at all. I ordered the rising sun burger medium-well and my husband got the gold standard medium-rare, both with steakfries. When the burgers arrived, they looked delicious, but not nearly as \"pretty\" as in the photos in the gallery on their website. I tried a crispy fry first and burned the roof of my mouth...those little metal pails must really hold in the heat!? Both of our burgers were tasty, but came overcooked. And my beef patty was a lot thinner than I anticipated. I think the burgers are called \"big buns\" because the bun's bigger than the burger and fixin's! The waitress brought our bill without asking if we wanted dessert...the main reason why I wanted to try the place! I told her we wanted to order the candy store, and she said, \"Oh, since you ordered the shake, I just figured you wouldn't want dessert too. Most people don't get both.\" It might've been all the cool piggy artwork surrounding me, but that was a bit offensive and made me feel like a lil' piggy! The dessert was the best part of the meal...especially the shooters on the bottom. It was fun eating cotton candy in a restaurant! It was adorable! But I wouldn't say their handmade candies are worth $15. I probably won't return to Holstein's after dropping $81 at the mediocre burger joint with fun desserts. Atmosphere was fun and artwork was amazing! (Wanted to end on a positive note.)",

Our bartender, Marcell, provided some of the BEST service I've ever experienced, especially considering it was a Saturday night and a nice little crowd had formed at the bar.  Each of us ordered something completely different and he knew exactly what we asked for and prepared them quickly and perfectly.  As soon as one of us would finish our drink he would politely offer another, we did not have to sit there with an empty glass.  Superb service!!!  Needless to say, a \"quick drink\" turned into an entire night hanging out at Holsteins, listening to great music, dancing in our chairs, laughing and having one of the best nights in Vegas.  We will definitely come back to Holsteins on every future trip we make to Vegas!!",

My first two times I was here, I was not impressed by their burgers.  This 3rd time, I ordered again their Rising Sun burger (Kobe beef, teriyaki sauce, yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado).  The combination of different flavors worked really well together and this burger is definitely a hit with me.  The bun, a standard burger bun, was a bit stiffer than I prefer but the overall goodness of the burger makes me overlook this minor shortcoming.  I strongly recommend trying this burger.  The fries were ordinary and need salt, imo.  Holsteins offers a good range of exotic beers which I always like to taste-test when I am out.  Perhaps about 15 beers on tap of non-standard-fare beers.  Get a burger here and have the Rising Sun!",

Way too thick (both in size and texture). Maybe it's because I didn't get a million toppings on my burger that there was too much bread but I'm generally pretty simple with my burger order.  Fries were pretty good (ordered the shoestring).  Highlight of the meal was the milkshake. Ordered the Drunken Monkey (sans alcohol) and it was really delicious.

Large, loud, and sceney on its own and all the more so with Marquee launching its dayclub across the way it was amongst the sunkissed and scantily clad that we entered Holsteins at the eleven o'clock opening hour and led to a large table with views of both the televised NHL playoffs as well as the crowd our meal began promptly with buttered popcorn and water as effusively friendly and efficient service guided us through the new spring menu.  Not particularly fond of burgers myself but willing to share in the setting of other selections it was with a duo of creamy, boozed-up shakes alongside four underwhelming hushpuppies that tasted neither of shrimp nor spicy pork that our order kicked-off and progressing at a good pace as the dining crowd swelled it was not long before the second wave arrived; the $17 pasta hilariously overpriced given the dearth of lobster and small size but both the belly on bao and burger truly delicious - the later a perfect medium with great balance and texture derived from impeccable accoutrements including the melting avocado.  Never one to skimp on sweets, particularly in belated celebration of my friend's birthday, it was with the new \"Un-Birthday\" cake that our meal concluded and featuring layers of dense cake juxtaposing smooth frosting in a portion large enough for four suffice it to say that the $15 charge is warranted, a rarity on any Block 16 menu.",

They aren't super strong so I suggest getting a second shot added. We had the cereal and red velvet shakes. Personally I liked the cereal better! The burgers were big and juicy as well. We didn't have to wait also which was a plus. Visiting Vegas is all about being a fatty (and trying to look hot at the same time) so coming here was perfect. We always have Serendipity for desserts here during the hot summer months, but this might be my new go-to for ice cream treats.",

My burger was just ok... I can't really say much other than the fact that the garlic chive aioli was amazing on the burger. The baby arugula was pretty good on there too. My fiancees burger on the other hand was pretty bland. We were expecting it to be super bbq as it had brisket on there but honestly it wasn't very impressive at all.  For dessert we ordered a campfire smores milkshake and that was probably the greatest milkshake ever. However, we were a bit disappointed bc it seemed like the portion you get for ordering it to go is less than the portion than if you were to order and drink it at the actual restaurant... And it's the same price. Regardless, the shake was great and not too overpowering with the richness. Let's just say that I didn't need a glass of water after drinking that shake.  Honestly, bachi burger remains my favorite in Las Vegas as of now...so I don't think I'll be back here anytime soon.",

He asked for medium rare and it came medium. But again, he's hard to please! I had the beef sliders add goat cheddar and it was delicious! We also tried the Cuban street tacos which were also very tasty. Lastly, we ordered the maple bacon shake with whiskey which was, again, tasty! Great service as well.

    "text": "So after all the hype about how great this place is, I finally tried it.  These type of restaurants are usually my favorite.  I love great burgers, and anything spun off in the form of an upscale burger joint.  The appetizer, which was chicken queso with chips that was pretty nice.  The burger I ordered was perfectly cooked and the beef was great, but the bun was a really weird consistency, not crispy/toasted, and not soft.  It was kinda like a soft bagel.  Too tough for a burger with a lot of toppings, and everything wanted to slide out of the burger.    The lettuce on the burger was like butter lettuce or something really soft and not crisp, and had a bitterness not adding to the burger.  Also the steak fries are a misnomer, they are actually wedges, there is a big difference.  Not a remarkable restaurant of this type, I would much rather go to le burger brasserie in the paris, BLT burgers in the mirage, or the burger bar in the mandalay shops.  The ambience was nothing special either.  Go to the hidden/secret pizza place upstairs from this for a better meal in a cooler place.",

I recently got back to the US and went to Vegas. I went to Burger Bar and got the Kobe burger, and hate me if you must but I was searching for another burger.  Enter the Gold Standard which I'm still digesting. Thank you for helping me cross that off the list, Gold Standard Burger! The arugula and the goat cheese made this burger over and over, though you would have caught me dipping it in ketchup bc it did get a bit dry without any traditional condiments.  So why 4 stars? Not bc of service bc our waiter Derek was awesome. It was the shake...I got the Drunken Monkey. And I love me some shakes, but maybe I liked the burger so much that it made the shake seem less impressive. The shake brought it down to 4 stars. But the burger and service were 5ers.",

We checked out the menu on Saturday (after stuffing our faces at a buffet) and decided we must try it the next day.   We went in at about 11am on Sunday, and were seated right away. The vibe is kinda \"hipster-y\"/trying too hard but I didn't let that get in the way, because obviously...it's the food that counts! (most of the time. ;) )  Our waitress brought over popcorn and we ordered our food.   I got the $15 Longhorn burger (medium-well patty, smoked beef brisket, bbq sauce and pickle...it also comes with coleslaw but I'm not a big fan. :] ) , steak-cut fries, and a $11 Frozen Grasshopper shake (peppermint meringue, crunchy chocolate chip balls, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka).  Our food came out rather quickly, which was awesome because we were all starving. I took one bite of my burger and felt instant gratification! WOW! Being the carnivore that I am, I was all about the meat and it went above and BEYOND my expectations! I am also usually weary of BBQ sauces but this one was ON POINT. Not too sweet, not too spicy, just tangy enough! I was only disappointed in that they forgot to give me my dill pickle. It's okay though...the rest of the burger was so good that I'll let it slide. :D  The fries were great, and seasoned perfectly..I only wish they would have given me MOOOORE! :(  The shake was good, and you could taste the vodka, so it's not like they were stingy with it.   The service was good as well. Our waitress came by a couple of times to ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything else.  My bf and I already made plans for visiting again anytime we go back to Vegas. It's a MUST TRY for sure. :)",

    "text": "So here's the thing: I love this place, but I'm teetering on 3 stars. If there were 3.5, I'd give it that. When we FIRST visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  And their burgers are very good. Very, very good.  But, we've gone a handful of times now and the last few, I've been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. Our server, the last two times, hasn't offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). The first time, we didn't know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. The second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.  But the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. And we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone's attention, we'd have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.  He (or the kitchen, can't be sure) slathered my turkey burger in Russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and I had a whole conversation that went something like this:  Me: \"Could I please have the Russian dressing on the side or not at all?\"  Him: \"So, look, do you want it or not?\"  Look, FLO, I don't want it at all, I was just trying to be flexible. Instead, I had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-Russian my turkey burger, which if I'm being honest, wasn't that great. (The turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip 'em.)  My other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. I appreciate that it's Vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but I'd like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. And this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it's seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you're trying to enjoy your sliders. It's just not my jam, so to speak.  I can highly recommend the Gold Standard and the Steakhouse burger, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. I like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  Two of my friends have told me the Captain Hook salmon burger is also really good.    Other high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. They menu has expanded as well and they've got a lot of interesting choices. They're great at their social media, too. Love that.    Overall, I do really like Holstein's and am rather bummed to review it this way.A year ago, it would've been at least 4.",

    "text": "This place was so so. I had the steakhouse burger that came with fries for $18.50. The burger meat was cooked perfectly. The unfortunate thing about this burger was it was a \"wet\" burger. The bun was soggy 2 minutes in. Also, there was supposed to be a pepper ground top on the burger itself.  I didn't taste it untill I only had a quarter of the burger left. Then it was whole peppercorns. Fries were ok... just ok.... I expect better from Holsteins if they are going to charge the same price as their competition. Server was polite and the food came out relatively fast.",

My husband ordered the Drunken Monkey shake and he really enjoyed it.    we were to share our orders since we wanted to try the various burgers.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sliders and my husband ordered the Billionaire Burger with the foie gras and truffle mayo.  Well, when our burgers were delivered I only had 3 small bites of the burger....I was in heaven.  My tuna sliders were okay, because the buns were a little hard and dry.  I was in heaven when I bit into the burger though!!  The french fries were fantastic as well.  The burger was expensive, but well worth it.  We sat on the couches in the lounge for lunch, because we didn't want to wait 15 minutes for a table.  It was like having lunch in our living room.  We will be back!!",

I did not realize it was so close to closing time, my bad.   I was a party of one, so I ordered the classic burger and a soda. I figured this would be quick and easy and I would be out of their hair. the soda came first, small glass, wasn't  offered a refill until after the food was eaten. I was warned when I ordered that they tend to cook towards the rarer side, so expect my med-rare preference to show up a little bloody. the fries were not great, below average for a burger joint.  the burger looked great and was a little on the mushy side, but there was a stack of regular toppings that made it look pretty.   something didn't seem right with it but it was late and I didn't want to hang around and be a fussy customer.  I left some unfinished and after paying the bill was not feeling great.   upon examining the remains of the burger at this point I noticed a layer of crud cooked onto the burger.  upon closer examination I became aware that this layer was wax paper that had been seared into the burger. no wonder I was feeling ill... I showed the waiter who confirmed this was not something that was a normal topping and he apologized.  no effort was made beyond that and this disapointed me a bit.",

I ordered the Al Pastor Burger and my wife ordered the Gold Standard.  The Al Pastor Burger was quite flavorful and both the burger and al pastor were really juicy, but towards the end the burger became a mess and really difficult to eat. She says the Gold Standard was \"not bad, but a bit overpriced\". I have to agree with that sentiment as I felt the same way about my burger.  I don't think that I would re-visit Holsteins again, given how many amazing restaurants are in Las Vegas. All in all the burger isn't bad, but it isn't mind-blowing by any means.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp, you currently get a 50% off any draft beer for checking in!  Holsteins Shakes & Buns offers some good burgers as well as shakes that you can add alcohol to. Apparently, they've won best burgers in Vegas in 2015 and 2016. The spacious restaurant is located on the busy 2nd floor of The Cosmopolitan hotel with a lot of other restaurants. Half of the restaurant seating is at the bar with TVs or at tables that give you a good view of the TVs, and half of the restaurant seating is regular seating with no TVs. I recommend parking in The Cosmopolitan's underground parking garage, which is free for the first hour and $7 for 1-4 hours.  We were given a complimentary bucket of popcorn, which I thought was pretty unique. We ordered the $18.50 Rising Sun Burger, which consisted of Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado as well as a $11 Greener Pastures Salad consisting of house greens with tomato, cucumber, shaved carrot, and avocado tossed in balsamic vinaigrette. The salad was a good portion size, pretty standard, and they didn't overdo it with the dressing. The Rising Sun Burger was pretty good, but the Kobe beef just didn't seem that much different than what I'd usually taste from ordering a gourmet not-Kobe-beef hamburger at any other burger restaurant. Their burger entrees also don't come with complimentary fries or small salad, which makes paying for a $18.50 gourmet burger that is slightly smaller than a Red Robin burger seem even less worth it. We did add the $7 Sweet Potato Fries though, and they were on point.  Looking back, the meal was good, but it ultimately wasn't that memorable. If this restaurant was in the suburbs, I'd probably come every once in a while to enjoy some burgers and fries while watching a big game. But if you're visiting Las Vegas, then I'd lean towards paying a bit more to try some of the more unique restaurants here.",

Every burger on the menu sounded really appealing! Interesting flavor and texture combinations - I don't think we would had been disappointed by any of them to be honest. After going back and forth what felt like forever long, my husband ultimately decided on the billionaire burger and I opted for their al pastor burger.   Billionaire burger was worth every penny. The thick cut of foie gras cooked to perfection, the generous slap of sweet onion chutney oozed all over, the beautifully charred, juicy beef patty got me dancing out of my chair - every bite was heavenly, every bite was magical.   Al pastor burger - this burger was a mouthful of yumssss. Topped with thick slices of juicy, fatty al pastor - this burger is for all the meat lovers out there. I did wish they layered the pineapple a bit more evenly. The pineapple to meat ratio was a little underwhelming. Not enough sweetness to balance the entire burger. Nevertheless, still a really well done burger!  The sweet potato fries were a bit cold and stale (mostly burnt ends) - wouldn't recommend the substitution.   The shakes - my husband and I wanted to be nicer to our figures and decided to skip them. One shake for 4 people made more sense - they are ginormous and we are not young anymore. Maybe if we come with groups on our next visit.   Overall - would definitely return to try the other fun burgers!",

I looked at their menu thinking I would have enough room for a burger, fries and one of their over the top, diabetic but delicious milkshakes. I'm a little sad to say that I was wrong.   Their burgers are a little pricey, but it is Vegas, it is in the Cosmopolitan, and it is pretty damn good. Not only did my group swim for most of the day and walk the strip in the hot ass muggy weather, it really was good. I'm not just saying that bc we were starving and getting hangry. I wrongly ordered my burger medium well because I was afraid there would be too much red for me, but even my mistake of an order was pretty good. I loved their skinny, shoestring fries. They make you feel less guilty bc they're so thin and dainty but have that crisp crunch everyone deserves from their fries.   A little sad they only had 2-3 local beers, but they make up for it with their alcoholic milkshakes and long list of craft beers from everywhere.   We waited almost 45 minutes and because we made the trek there we were determined. I'm not sure if the circumstances were different if we would still wait, but I'm glad we did. Their pictures do their burgers justice!!",

As for the burgers, I have tried a few of them. Side note the patties are hella thick too! I usually go with medium rare for my burgers. My personal recommendations are: The Gold Standard, The Nom Nom Burger and The Fun-ghi Burger. They're all bomb. They're all thick. They're all Juicy. They're all worth the price. Thank you Holstein's! Can't wait to come back!",

It wasn't that it wasn't good, I just know I have had better burgers but I couldn't pinpoint exactly why.  Maybe the bun? Lol.  3.5 stars on the food.   The service was very friendly and quick. Drinks filled all the time and he checked on us often.  5 stars for our server.   The atmosphere was good but didn't have quite the feel of something like a Hard Rock or the like.  It was still a place I could definitely hang out and have a beer or two at on a regular basis.   Overall it's a good burger joint and I'll be back.   Enjoy!",

To start off they give you popcorn to munch on that had some kind of dill seasoning it it.  A little salty for my taste, but good.  I had the smore milkshake with an extra shot and it was phenomenal!  I couldn't finish the whole thing.  I had to the mindset to try at least one more when I first started but it so rich!  Very good!  We had the cheese curds and egg rolls for an app.  The curds were average and the egg rolls had a cheese in them which made them stand out a tad over average.  I got the billionaire burger which was delicious.  Next time if I were to get the milkshake, I think I would only order an an apologized with it because the milkshake is so filling.

    "text": "I don't get restaurants that feel the need to go \"over-the-top\" with their burgers. In my opinion, bigger is not always better, and any idiot can throw some foie or gold foil on a burger and charge $$$ for it. So it was predicable that I was a little hesitant to try Holsteins Shakes & Buns.  With burger names like the Golden Standard and the Billionaire, I was prepared for the worst. However, with a select few ingredients, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, the Golden Standard was a nice blend of aged beef, offering up a nice juiciness with each bite, enhanced with the goat cheese and crunch from the bacon (about every other bite, so just unpredictable enough to make eating it fun).  AMAZINGLY, the bun not only held up the entire time and the bottom was not overly soggy or disintegrate, but felt amazing in my hand every time I picked it up. You could almost say that it was worth every loving caress. Definitely changed my long-held belief about only ciabatta bread having the structure to being able to handle burgers well.   I was slightly disappointed with the shake as it was a little runnier than I expected; even with the alcohol lowering the freezing temperature. The flavors were delicious, though, and I asked for a little ice to cut the sweetness and made it colder. Expect to maybe share a shake between 2 people unless you're really able to pack it away. Between the shake and 1/2 the burger (plus a sampling of fries), I was stuffed.  Maybe the idea would be to get a work-out in, then fuel-up and go work-out again; because that's the only way I could see myself remotely being hungry enough to be able to finish this.",

Then again, everything in Vegas is expensive, so it was one of our more reasonable dining options. The service was good but slow, but then again we were with a group of 10 people. A few of us ordered the alcoholic milk shakes which were pretty awesome. Overall this is definitely a great place to check out if you're looking for a casual and reasonably priced meal on the Vegas strip!",

    "text": "Wow.  One of the best burgers I've had in a very long time, and the overall meal was exceptional and reasonably priced.  Went with a buddy of mine for a late lunch, expecting to pop in and out, but this was a meal worth savoring.  I got the Lobster Truffled Mac & Cheese to start, which was slightly runnier than I would have liked, due to what the waiter referred to as \"copious amounts of tellagio and mascarpone cheeses\", but the dish was flavorful and solid.  The real treat however was the burger.  My friend and I both had the Gold Standard, his without the goat cheddar in favor of regular cheddar, and mine with.  They were both cooked perfectly, which is hard to do when you get an order for \"Extremely Rare, and I mean mooing\", but they nailed it.  They nailed my medium rare as well, and the combination of the tomato confit in place of standard tomato (simply brilliant idea, why have I not seen that done before?) and the strong cheese combined with a thick, juicy, perfectly prepared piece of bacon and garlic-chive aoili made it the first burger I haven't put ketchup on in I can't even remember how long, and I'm so glad I did.  Ketchup would have destroyed this exquisitely crafted creation.  Despite the raving, I considered giving this review 4 starts rather than 5 due to the consistency of the appetizer and the over-saltiness of the steak fries that came with my burger, but ultimately, those trivial details pale in comparison to the awesome that was that burger.  If you're in Vegas, and you're looking for a meal that won't break your budget and will give you plenty to talk about, try out Holsteins.  You will not be sorry.  Also, if waitresses that are easy on the eyes are your thing, I suggest sitting at the bar and ordering from there.",

As for drinks, I didn't want to be too full for Marquee so I didn't get the try any of their famous shakes. Right after the drink orders were taken, we received a small bucket full of buttered popcorn. It was a bit salty but it had a lot of flavor. We also ordered the potato chips for $6. It was tasty but not $6 worth.   For the main course, my friend and I ordered from the Tiny Buns section. We tried the Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Tenderloin Rossini. REMINDER: Those burgers are tiny. The portions are literally 4 bites total. The Crispy Pork bun had too much hoison sauce but the pork was cooked perfectly. The Tenderloin Rossini was definitely worth the $17.50. The tenderloin was cooked to perfection. The downside was that I could not taste the foie gras nor the truffle mayo.   The overall vibe of the restaurant and the food was 5 star worthy. But the restaurant was too loud. I seriously could not hear myself think. Therefore I brought the ratings down to 4 stars. If you are ever at the Cosmopolitan, you should definitely check this place out.",

I was pretty happy to go there on Saturday with some friends before going bowling, but unfortunately I was just irritated by my experience there and I can honestly say I most likely won't go back. When I got there at 8:45, I put in for a table. The hostess told me it would be 45 minutes. This was fine since I was still waiting for my party to show up. An hour later, I still had not received the text saying a table was available. I walked back up there from the casino floor and see that there are open tables and no line. I approached the hostess (different from the one I spoke to), and she happily says she can get me seated right away. The rest of my party was waiting in line to get in to the parking garage, so I honestly was not in a hurry to be seated. The guy showing me to the table asks why I was getting a table now if the rest of my friends weren't there yet and I said they are trying to park. Then the waiter asks the same thing as well as a busser. It was really irritating. The waiter treated my friend like she was dumb when she asked a question, and seemed overall irritated to being helping our table out. Next time I want a burger, I will be going back to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, or BLT. I was so irritated about this experience, I really have no interest in going back and trying again even though I liked the food. The food was the only thing I liked.",

Then our chipper waitress Noel came around and greeted us, brought us our drinks and koozies and was off again. Next time she returned, we ordered an appetizer, the fried green tomatoes, to start. The tomatoes were much different than the ones I've had before. Not sure if they were a different kind, heirloom or not, makes a big difference. The honey mustard and asian sauce on top was no good and the lobster bites on the side were good but lacking True lobster flavor.  Then came our burgers, 2 basics and a california turkey. The buns were rather tough and the fries could have easily come from a  generic supermarket frozen food aisle bag but the burgers were pretty good.  The reason this review got 3 stars is the fact that our waitress was accommodating, respectful and really great.",

I got the Black and White malt (non alcoholic) and it was delicious. Perfect amount of malt. That was dessert for us but it seemed that everyone was ordering them for before their meals which I thought was strange. Anyways, yes wonderful mix of vanilla and chocolate. Next, my friend got the \"Urth\" burger. It's a vegan burger with all the fixins. She said it was delicious but tasted a bit like a spicy cup of chicken ramen noodles. But she does enjoy Ramen noodles so I suppose she liked it. I opted for a good old red meat burger, more specifically The Gold Standard. DRY AGED BEEF SIRLOIN BURGER W/SMOKED BACON, AGED GOAT CHEDDAR CHEESE, TOMATO CONFIT, BABY ARUGULA & GARLIC-CHIVE AIOLI (courtesy of their actual menu). Yummmmmm!!!!!!!!! So so good. Now to the stuff I could have dealt without. Hostesses were irritated and seemed very \"valley girl\". I jsut want some lunch I don't need any attitude. And our waiter was such a dbag. I think it was because I didn't want his reccomendations. Uh what else was I supposed to do while I waited 20 minutes for my table...look at the menu...  Come here.

Classic Sliders: 2 small (2 bite) sliders served with chips. Very small portion. Additional $2 charge for cheese. Good, but don't expect to get full.  Lobeter rolls served with coleslaw: ya.... wasn't a fan. I don't know what I was expecting, but my boyfriend liked them.  Steak fries with utter sauce: good.  Ice tea: nice and refreshing, but get this... it was $8!!! Really?!?!?  J Vineyard Pinot Gris: Sweet  Drunken Monkey: A MUST! Delicious!",

The buffalo chicken dip was INSANE, topped with shredded carrots and celery, and studded with blue cheese. Served with fresh tortilla chips...but honestly we just ate it with a spoon! The house beer was really good, crisp and refreshing. Would definitely go back!!",

Yes I understand it's a burger some might even say they all taste the same. No, no they do not.  I've tried many of the celebrity burger restaurants and they didn't impress me as much as this place did.  I got the nom nom burger which is Kobe beef cus it was one a couple bucks more than the regular burger. Delicious and it was massive I wasn't even close to finishing it. It also comes with fries which were a lot.   I also got the buffalo chicken dip. Highly recommend my boyfriend & I were fighting to see who can eat it faster.   Definitely worth the try.",

    "text": "Hostess: friendly and prompt, she took down my info and told me they would text when a table was ready. That's an awesome feature. Who wants to stand in front of Holsteins for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sports book?! I received the text, although we snagged a spot at the bar before it came.   Food: Truffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w/ Maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. Two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. It tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. That first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. Boo. We left half of it there and I refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not True  Nom Nom Burger ($16.50 - Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. On one hand, the beef was realllllly good. Flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. On the other hand, the toppings added 0. My theory is they need to triple what they put on top the burger. When you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. Conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.  Drinks: Ginger Julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite.   Rhubarb Pie Bam-Boozled Shake ($11 - Absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. Should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? Probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!  Would I come back here? Yep. Would I order differently? Yep. Will I finally end this review? Sure.",

Burgers here may not be huge in diameter, but they are DENSE. Really delicious combos of flavors...I think it's hard to go wrong when you're ordering here.   We had the S'mores boozy milkshake, which didn't really stack up to the price tag, but was tasty nonetheless. The house-made marshmallow on top was an awesome touch. You can easily split one of these with a friend and get more than enough.   The service, decor, and people watching here is great. I would definitely return, at the very least to see another bachelorette party get heckled by the grossest tornado of bros (a bronado?) in the world.   Go!",

Lesson learned: don't order a salad at a burger joint. My boyfriend loved his burger, on the other hand, and had the option to add a fried egg. I did notice that the burgers are a little bit on the small side for the price.   There are TONS of beer choices as well. Love that they served pizza-flavored popcorn as a free appetizer. The buffalo chicken dip was amazing and a must-order appetizer (ask for extra chips if you need them).   Again, I probably just ended up ordering the wrong thing (salad with ahi tuna) which was really bland... but worth coming here to try the burgers and shakes.",

Delicious, split a bottle of bubbly with my friend, and we each ordered different burgers to share (Gold Standard & El Caliente), and had the fried pickle appetizers.   Very rarely would I think dishes should be bigger, but I do think these burgers are so delicious, on top of their price that they could stand to be a little larger.  Upon flashing my ID for my bday, another server appeared at our table, and made a couple of delicious dry-ice desserts for us. It was very cool to see, and the treats were delicious. I would eat here again and complete recommend washing down your burger with champagne.",

    "text": "In the spirit of trying new places while also being confined to the perimeter area of Cosmopolitan, I decided to give Holstein's a try. Luckily on a Monday late afternoon, there was enough availability to book a reservation on Open Table at 5:45 pm, just one hour prior. I was able to walk right on down to the second floor and check in within 5 minutes flat.  There was a baseball game and football game going on, so the bar/lounge area (which is right up front) was loud and rowdy. Even with seating in the wayy back away from the bar, it would still be noisy. I opted instead to order to go, charge the cost to my room, and enjoy the Rising Sun burger from the comfort of my hotel room with the TV show of my choice.  The burger itself was filling, which made me happy since it cost $18! It better fill me up at that price! The Rising Sun has a Kobe beef patty, tempura avocado (love it!), nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and teriyaki glaze. It also comes with a side of fries. The burger was good, but the teriyaki sauce was rather salty, which really takes away from an otherwise yummy choice. It didn't help that the fries were salty too. I really needed the ketchup not because I needed more flavor, but to use the taste to balance the saltiness. I was so full that 1/4 of the burger remained, which I snacked on and finished two hours later.   Not a bad substitute for Secret Pizza or Wicked Spoon if you want to stay around the Cosmo area and grab a low-key meal without the three or four dollar signs from the other more fine dining options.",

    "text": "I'm not so much of a burger gal but what got my attention was their Bam-Boozled Nutella Crunch Milkshake! I am a lifetime Nutella fan and I love anything with that creamy hazelnut chocolate goodness in it.   My friends and I went and had a great time at Holstein's - our server, Lucas (I think that was his name) was patient and answered all of our many questions and even chuckled at our cheesy jokes like someone who has been working with drunk people for a long time.   Lucas brought out Pizza flavored popcorn, which was completely demolished by our hungry group. It was nicely flavored and not too salty which was perfect.  I had the Urth vegetarian burger (house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts & avocado, sans avocado) which was very enjoyable and unlike a lot of vegetarian patties, was moist and not dry and crumbly at all.  I also tried a bite of the The Rising Sun (Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado). The Kobe burger was juicy and flavorful but what I suggest to Holstein's is that they have a lighter hand for the teriyaki glaze - I felt that the glaze overpowered the flavor of the Kobe beef and spicy mayo, so much so that all I could taste was the sweetness of the glaze which bordered on cloying.  My 5th star is for the Bam-Boozled Nutella Crunch Milkshake (Nutella, frangelico, caramelized hazelnut pieces) Wow. The milkshake was nice and thick and I could taste the frangelico hazelnut liqueur but I can see how someone can drink the whole shake and get a little buzzed afterwards. The hazelnut pieces added the perfect crunch in texture to the shake and this was the best shake I have ever had.   This is definitely a solid burger place and I am determined to work my way down the list of delicious burgers and shakes (not all at once of course!). It just give me an excuse to go to Holsteins over and over again.",

When I come back I think I will just go to In-N-Out or Shake Shack if I am craving a burger.  The burgers here we A-OK. The patty itself was fairly pitiful and not very flavorful. I got their signature  burger that has been on a bunch of shows, etc. It was good, not mind blowing, but just good. I would definitely say not worth $18.50. But it is a hotel in vegas so I get it. The toppings were all good but was really where the flavor lived. The bun was good. The fries were very good, I'll give them that.  My wife got the burger with the avocado and jalapenos. It too was just AOK, good and serviceable but not an outstanding burger.   The service was outstanding, I will definitely give them that. They have a decent beer selection too. If you use your help app you get a free 12oz. house beer. It wasn't bad at all, tasted like a cross between bud light and stella (yeah weird mix I know, but that's what it is). And it certainly was the right price.  I may come back, but I may try another place first.",

May be we should have become one of those couple who just text seating next too each other.   But getting to the food - the food was AWESOME! The only problem is that we didn't want to seat there long enough to really enjoy it.. pretty much ate it as fast as we could and planned our escape out... Amazing how something so small, like super loud music can ruin your dinner experience.    The decor is pretty cool, though! Loved the cows!",

Nothing too \"OMG\"   Service/ambiance: I came for a late lunch on a Saturday and there was no wait. Probably because of the odd hour dining. But the service here was great. Anytime we needed something we were helped and the waiters were all so friendly. As for the atmosphere it was very relaxing and just a great hang out place for my friends and I to come and enjoy our food and each other's company.  Food: -Check in for your free beer! The beer (I forgot the name...sorry!) was just any draft beer. I shared with everyone so we could all try. Nothing strong so it's a good beer everyone could enjoy.  -Nom Nom Burger: This was recommended to me by our waitress. I like! It has some extra crispy chips inside (which surprisingly stayed in my burger the whole time, I tend to struggle). I really liked the chips inside. It gave the burger a nice little pizazz. The burger itself wasn't exactly super juicy, just your average burger. Very flavorful though! I just like it more on the juicier side, which I guess wouldn't work out too well with the chips. Either way, I'd definitely get this again if I were to come back  -Milkshakes (in general): I tried several and all of them were good. We ordered the ones with alcohol which I couldn't taste so that's good. They weren't shakes I would get to try to get a buzz so I'm not sure the additional alcohol is even worth it. But they did taste good!  Overall, I was just meh about the whole experience. Nothing bad, nothing great. I'd come back if I'm in the area. Not something I'm DYING to come back for though.",

In fact, I don't need to feel like a high roller at all. Furthermore, most of what passes as creative food in Las Vegas often is odd pairings designed to be sensational rather than complementary.  I expected all of these things to be True at Holstein's but I was pleasantly surprised when my order arrived. I honestly can't recall what I ordered, as it's been a while, but the burger was cooked spot on, flavors were well balanced, the fries were amazing, and my shake might have been the best thing I've ever consumed through a straw. If I'm lucky enough to stay near Hostein's again then I'll definitely make the trip back.",

The atmosphere and decor was fun, the restaurant was clean, and the waitress was very friendly.   I ordered the Carbonara Chicken burger with Grilled Chicken Breast, Bacon, Mushrooms, Sweet Pea Aioli, Fried Egg, and Provolone Cheese. This was the juiciest and most flavorful chicken burger that I have ever eaten. They have countless beer choices and my friend ordered the Drunken Monkey shake and it was also delicious.

There was an option for a 3 course meal which included an appetizer between chicken dip with salsa chips or salad. Also they have a NOM NOM burger and this stood out to me because there are potato chips in it. The potato chip was not soggy either first bite you were able to hear a big crunch (; Presentation of the burger was well thought out all the flavors blended well together. Fries were cut medium not too thin or too thick and definitely was freshly made.   If I had to choose I would still pick Gorden Ramseys burger place (;",

What did I get?  Regular shake and below-average burger.  I got the Brown Cow Float because I love root beer.  For a root beer float, this is pretty good even with the chocolate pop rocks annoyingly popping in my mouth.  I did not taste the Smirnoff whipped cream vodka at all though but judging by the slight warmth in my face, something must have been in there.  Next was the Machete burger which had Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli.  I asked for it medium rare and it came out medium.  Quality of the beef and the seasoning of it didn't seem that great.  This burger sounds spicy but isn't at all.  Bread was a bit dry.  Our group also shared the lobster mac 'n cheese and buffalo wings which aren't worth going into detail for.  Mac 'n cheese is enough for 2-4 people to take a couple bites and is overpriced.  Buffalo wings were standard.  I've had too many good burgers, some for more and some for less, in my time.  Never will I let Holstein trick me into paying $16 again.  Never again!",

Service was excellent.  Our waiter, [name removed for legal reasons], was always on top of checking up on us and making sure we were enjoying our food.  Food breakdown:  -Popcorn: I didn't know you got this automatically, or I would have mentally prepared myself.  It's ok.  It's popcorn...you gotta do reeaaallly well to impress me with popcorn.  -Onion rings: Good, but a mixed bag.  The first one I had was the prefect onion ring: perfect breading, a clean bite (no strings following you out), and perfectly crispy.  And while two of those never changed, I kept getting strings after that.  Not a deal killer, but definitely not \"perfect\" throughout the meal.  -Fun-Ghi Burger: Do you get it? Fun-ghi?  I...I actually don't get it.  You should probably just call it the Fungi Burger...save everyone the trouble.  That being said this was honestly, without a doubt, the BEST use of mushrooms on a burger I have ever had.  It had a delicious earthiness to it.  Not my favorite burger of all time, but definitely my favorite mushroom-based burger.  That might sound like a small field...but it is.  -Nom Nom Burger: It must be for the Kobe beef, but I find it funny that a burger with truffle mayo is cheaper than one with potato chips.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away.  -Fries: You get a lot of fries.  Now I know everyone is waiting for me to get to the shakes...and by everyone I mean you, Dale...but we didn't get one.  First off, the regular, non-alcoholic shakes were basic and didn't seem worth the time.  Second, I looked over the menu for the alcoholic shakes and every time I read the ingredient list all I could think about was the taste of straight alcohol and I lost my appetite for a shake.  Is that my fault?  Sure.  Should I have even mentioned all this?  Who's to say?  You?  I don't think so.  You don't own me.  Will I be back?  Perhaps.  I enjoyed it, though I wouldn't wait in a long line for it.  They just opened one nearby my house, though that one is just getting slammed for poor service so I don't know.  Also, whoever did the art for the walls either worked for Disney or learned a bit from their style.  I saw the 3-oval trick for the eyes, which works so well it's insane.",

    "text": "Moovin' on Up!  It's 2 PM and you're in The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV & starting to get hungry. You don't want to buffet again; it's too early for Secret Pizza; you're not ready to blow your wad at Milos; you're not hungry enough for a steak, but you want more than coffee & snacks, so where do you go?   Moove on up to the 2nd floor of The Cosmo & graze at Holsteins Shakes & Buns. It's a cutesy, cow-themed, casual Americana restaurant/sports bar that serves a variety of gourmet burgers & sliders, fries, apps, salads & yes you can get an adult shake with those fries!   I came here in the afternoon for a 'tween meal & just wanted something light but substantial enough to tide me over til dinner. Sorry, I didn't try a burger or shake but there is a good selection of burgers available in several different protein options & a variety of intoxicatingly, sweet shakes (with or without alcohol) that looked sinfully tasty!   I opted for healthy & ordered the \"Greener Pastures Salad\" ($10) which includes house greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, shaved carrots & avocado, and I added grilled chicken breast for $8. So it was $18 total but was a generous-sized salad & the veggies were fresh & the chicken was tasty. I would recommend this salad if you want a healthy, filling lunch option.   I also got a side o'sweet potato fries that came served in a cute lil, silver tin bucket for $6. They were straight-cut, soft, tasty & without any unwanted sugary-coating, 4 gems!  FYI: You can grab a seat at the bar or at a table in the bar area or wait & get a table in the dining room for full service. I sat at a first-come, first-serve table in the bar area. Service was friendly & efficient, and my food was brought out fairly fast.   So if you're lookin' for a place to chill & grab a burger & fries, intoxicating shake, light lunch or late-night bar food, I udderly recommend grazing at Holsteins. My \"fast-casual\" lunch with a drink still cost nearly $40 with tip. So don't go here expecting a cheap, quickie. Prices for burgers here range from $13 to $18 & if you're feelin' fancy get the \"Billionaire Burger\" for $32 made with Kobe Beef & foie gras. Virgin shakes are $9, while spiked shakes are $13, regular fries are $5, SPF are $6, and salads & apps range from $10 to $18. Udder yelpers complained about the prices at Holsteins, yeah it's not Steak & Shake people! If you're here, there's really no udder choice! But really, ya can't beat convenience or mooey-gemlicious, Americana food when you're stayin' & playin' in The Cosmo!",

We also split the Moscow Moo milkshake with an extra shot of vodka for good measure. Our server Fabrixio (AKA Fab) was just that (fab) and even brought us out some extra goodies, including a creme de menthe meringue infused with liquid nitrogen at the end of the meal. When you bite into it, green \"smoke\" comes out of your mouth - so cool and super minty and refreshing. Highly recommended!",

WTF. who serves crumbled lobster meat?? it couldve been crumbs from leftover knuckle meat or even crawfish, how the hell would we know??! im not asking for an entire tail, but at least give us some chunks of lobster. it was minced. terrible. you could even taste it.   the beef patty is a probably about a 1/3lb. i like fuddruckers patties and even their buns, better.   my sweet potato fries were limp.   we'll be going back to burger bar in mandalay bay. or in-and-out.",

    "text": "When I had to make my way across the \"skywalk\" to work on the other side of the street, I always took a \"short cut\" through the Cosmo upstairs.  After our dinner at China Poblano, I learned to pay more attention to what else was up there, which was the reason why I zeroed in on Holstein's.  And hey - any restaurant serving burgers that even utilizes the COW'S FREAKIN' NAME, had better be ready to 'bring it', as far as I'm concerned.  So when Bear and I selected it for our burger fix, we were prepared for - at the very least - a 'transformative experience.'  So was it THAT kind of deal? Nope, not really.  But you could do SO much worse.  First of all - as promised - I have to give a shout-out to our server, Amanda.  Just that right, attractive combination of smiles, sass and 'savoir faire'' (NOTE TO MANAGERS: GET this woman a raise, STAT!) I've always loved that in the better restaurants in town, the staff always have an 'inside/out' knowledge of the menu and the daily specials, and in this particular area, Amanda did not disappoint. (Which is why Holstein's gets an extra star.)  With so many different styles of burger to choose from, it could have been an all-day task to select just one, but with her help, I chose the Nom-Nom Burger ($16.50), while Bear went \"classic\" and got the Gold Standard ($17.50).   Pricey? Well, DUH! What does anybody expect when they're using Kobe and dry- aged sirloin to craft the frickin' burgers? (And don't forget - this IS a 'Strip' joint we're talking about here, people!) And while we waited - but not for long - we got to check out the unique decor that included anime-style artwork of the Holstein's \"mascot\".  Cute...especially considering that he's on the menu as well as the wall!  For our 'intro', we had the Buffalo Chicken Dip ($12.00) a cluckin'-good twist on chili con queso served with warm tortilla chips, and Bear's 'de rigeur' item to try, the Cuban Street Tacos ($13.00) a delicious menage-a-trois of roast pork, ham and Swiss lovingly drizzled with pickle and spicy mustard aioli. The bite I had of one of them made me wonder if I should've gotten a separate appetizer as well....  And then came the burgs.  Bear liked his Standard just fine, and I added some 'meat candy' (aka BACON!) to my Nom-Nom for about two bucks more. I didn't know if I expected a burger with barbecue potato chips and 1000 Island dressing to actually work, but damn if didn't, and in quite a tasty way, too. (But then again...name one thing that doesn't taste better with bacon on it.)  It was quite the stunning companion to my Frozen Grasshopper Shake ($11.00).  And the fries served with were just the way I like them: crispy, spicy shoestrings, with none of the greasiness you get from other burger joints.  So, sure, Holstein's is giving up burgers, but not at Jack-In-The-Box prices, so it's always best to keep that in mind.  And as repeat visits go, I think we can file this one under \"Special Occasions\" mostly.  And we will always ask to be seated in Amanda's section...",

I may be a little biased with my rating as it is located in the Cosmopolitan and that is the hotel I stayed in, so it was very convenient.  But this place has great burgers and it is an awesome hangover fix.  I got the Hen House Burger cooked medium well.  The burger has an egg, bacon and I paid $1 more for the grilled onions as opposed to the raw onions.  My burger was more like a medium instead of medium well but it was juicy and delicious none the less.  I recommend this place for sure!",

I was debating between checking out Holsteins and BurgR, but I decided to try Holsteins since the Cosmo is my FAVE hotel! Too bad Holsteins isn't as great as the rest of the hotel..  I ordered the Golden Standard and of course I had to add an egg. With all the unique ingredients, I thought this burger was going to be awesome; but surprisingly it lacked the flavor I was looking for. I honestly think they need to season their meat a little more because I ordered the meat medium rare and it was dry. The burger just didn't \"wow\" me.   I also up charged for the onion rings, and those weren't impressive at all. They taste like regular onion rings that you would get at a typical burger place. I unfortunately didn't have room to order their famous alcoholic shakes.   Although my meal wasn't stellar, I definitely enjoyed how friendly the bartenders were. They were full of personality, and kept their guests entertained. I would return to Holsteins for their ice cold beer and alcoholic shakes, but I definitely would skip on the food..",

Satisfies that dessert craving where you can't decide if you want a red velvet cake or ice cream.  Ordered this shake both times as well the onion rings.  The dish that surprised me the most was the crispy pork belly bun with sweet potato fries. The veggies combined with the crispy pork belly with a lil bite of the cilantro at the end of that bite is the perfect feeling of 'OH SO FRESH AND GOOD!' but you don't fill the fullness that you get where you feel like you just ate the titanic! Would definitely order this again!  AND FINALLY the complimentary  POPCORN is soooooooooo delicious to snack on.",

It is really good and one of their best sellers.

I ordered the Nom Nom Burger (beef patty, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and 1000 island dressing) with an added fried egg. It comes with shoestring fries or steak-cut fries. The patty was cooked medium rare and the whole burger was mouth-watering good!!  Come hungry!!",

Don't bother folks, the shake was nummy but I highly doubt there was more than a splash of the amaretto that was supposed to be in it. If I pay that much for a drink, I do expect to actually taste the alcohol.  SO good for dinner, bad for drinking, and seeing as this is Vegas, I expect better drinks!",

We got seated right away and got our drinks.  This place pretty much has only burgers and shakes. I got the original burger and it was very good and very juicy my complaint was not with the food, it was all about the service.  I personally drink a lot of water when I done out like 3-4-5 cups.  I don't know why but I do haha.  Our waiter kept ignoring our table during out ENTIRE MEAL!  He kept on flirting with the bartender the whole time.  I'm a very patient man but this was ridiculous.  If the service wasn't this bad I would have given this place 4 stars easy. All it takes is one bad waiter to ruin my dining experience.  I won't be back.",

For $20 per burger, I expect it to be different somehow, but it was really just like going to Red Robin but paying twice as much for the same flavor and quality.  Using fancy ingredients only matters if it actually makes the burger taste better!  We got the Gold Standard, and the Fun-Ghi.  Both were tasty, but again not any better than an $8 burger from Red Robin, and not anywhere close to being as juicy and delicious as a $4 In N Out double double.  The fries were very average, but the onion rings were fresh and outstanding.  $6 for an orange cream soda that I can get for $1 at the grocery store is a little ridiculous too.  And after realizing how overpriced the burgers were, we decided to not pay $15 for an overpriced milkshake, and went to Sonic Drive Thru for a $2 half price happy hour milkshake which was probably just as good or better.  Overall, I would not ever eat here again, simply because I can get a burger that tastes just as good at half the price at Red Robin, in an atmosphere that is very similar.  The Cosmo is a nice hotel, but don't overpay for average food just to overpay for food, save that money for the slots and have more fun!",

I tried the Hen House burger, with bacon and a fried egg on it and it was very tasty, that's for sure. I loved the thin-cut french fries and could easily have eaten two servings (probably did anyway). SO, then I tried the Campfire Smores milkshake. HOLY CRAP. Then I tried another milkshake at the table, the Cereal Bowl, with Cap N' Crunch and Fruity Pebbles, which wasn't as good as the smores one, but I'm sure I could have downed about 4 of them in a sitting. Did I mention that the milkshakes have BOOZE in them? Ahhhh, yeah..... Anyway, I tried 2 of the specialty bloody Mary martinis; the Spicy one was served with a poached shrimp that was as big as Paul Bunyon's thumb, I swear. But the kicker drink was the Savory bloody Mary martini, with BEEF BRISKET INFUSED VODKA and a skewer that had 3 large chunks of perfectly cooked filet mignon- SO yum. Who thinks this stuff up? Brisket-infused vodka? How the hell would a person even make that?  Try this place out, you won't regret it.",

Still though, many places lack the inspiration and creativity to make a really solid burger. You pretty much just need some quality ingredients and a brilliant fat person.   The place is freaking gorgeous. I love the design and atmosphere of this chill, yet slightly upscale burger joint/bar. You got the March Madness games all over the TVs and the customers all into it. There are such comfortable seats. Gosh, if I had a burger joint and bar, I'd design it based around Holsteins.   BILLIONAIRE BURGER 4.5/5 That ish was awesome. Since Foie Gras is banned in California, I just had to get my fix over here in Las Vegas. I felt like a billionaire, sorta, for only about 20 bucks.  FRIED DILL PICKLES 4.5/5 Wow. I thought The Counter's Fried Pickle Chips were good, but this one takes the pickle.   STEAKHOUSE BURGER 4.5/5 Oh gosh, this was just so excellently concocted. The pepper in it was interesting and really gave it that kick it needed.  ONION RINGS 4/5 Tasty. Especially with the Garlic Aioli that we had. Wow. The sauces are good here too, btw.   The beer selection here is amazing. I'm not exactly a beer connoisseur, but I have my likes and dislikes. From the looks of it, my beer connoisseur buddies really liked their beers. They had like 5 different kinds it seemed haha. I tried the Piraat and it was pretty good, especially for being 10+ percent.   I feel like I must be back whenever I crave a burger.

The bun is perfect, soft and supple, like a woman's....ok skip that.  I'm a purist, give me a chocolate milkshake, none of that frankensteinsh concoction. It just hits the spot. My inner childhood.  My mouth died and went to chocolate heaven. Rich enough but not to the point where you need water every sip.  Why 4 stars and not 5?  When we were seated, our server was MIA. After 10 minutes, we had asked another server to look for our server to assist us, no such person showed up.  I understand they have their own section to deal with but atleast offer to get our drinks. After 5 minutes, we then asked a busboy...a very helpful busboy and explained our predicament. No one had seen us since being seated. He immediately apologized, 30 seconds later, a manager came up to apologize with the assigned server behind him.  He offered 15% off for our bill w/o us having to complain.  Our server apologized, it was a shift change and unfortunately, our location was no man's land.  It was like being at the border between syria and turkey.  After our orders were taken, food was rushed to be cooked to satisfy our cravings.  Good save",

Seriously, it was Valentines Day and they had the music so loud you couldn't even talk to your special date.   The menu is ambitious, unfortunately most items, kettle chips, onion rings, french fries, we tried were to salty. Burgers were alright though my Hen House did come with a fried over easy egg that was cooked through. When I told the food runner about this he argued with me and told me that its supposed to be runny, Uh yeah. He finally said that's how its supposed to be and walked off, I begged to differ. At one glance our waiter said it was wrong and fixed it, very cool! Burger was pretty dang good with loads of gooey yolk running down my fingers. This made up for the punky food runner and the overly salty sides and apps.   $1 beers and shots on Monday (their choice).  Word of advice to Holsteins, the customer should always be right.",

It wasn't too burnt which I liked and the spicy mayo in the burger made it even better. I also ordered the cookies and cream milkshake which was delicious. This milkshake was huge, and kind of pricey , but go big or go home right?!  My parents got the gold standard burger. They are the pickiest people when it comes to food, but they loved it! Dean was our waiter and he was literally the best. He always checked on us if we needed anything. Come to this place if you are planning a trip to Vegas. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "After checking out so many places to eat for dinner we made it to Holsteins and I was excited about a made in house veggie burger and that the sides are included in the $17 burgers making it a bit cheaper than other gourmet burger options in Vegas. The first hostess told us there would be a wait even though the didning area wasn't full but we could sit at the bar. They had a tiny what they called \"lounge\" consisting of 4 tables and two chairs each so we took that. I asked if we could order and have drinks until a table is free so we don't have to eat below our knees. Nope not possible to move once you sat down...WTF??? Ok I was hungry so we ordered, the Longhorn with steak fries for the man, veggie burger and salad for me which was a $3 upgrade. I hate when they do that, the few leaves of lettuce they give you don't cost more than the wedges my husband got, punishing you for trying to balance out your meal. Our waitress the dumbest isch I've ever come across. She was cooing over the single male patrons for a tip but dragged her ass bringing our stuff, got the drink order, the salad, my burger, everything wrong. The food tasted  like crap, honestly. I got my burger 15 minutes before my side salad and since I like it together I waited. Wrong dressing, wait again. By then burger cold, mushy, nasty and very wrong tasting. Complain to manager that the waitress is a complete waste of space and the food horrible, my meal comped. Barfed as soon as I made it back to my hotel room, thanks Holsteins!",

The Nom Nom burger (burger with chips and cheese inside) was on the salty side for me.  The Highlight: The highlight of this place every single time is the milkshakes. Whether you get them alcoholic or non-alcoholic, they are absolutely delicious. I tried the drunken monkey, the banana cream pie, and the fat boi, and they are all soooooo good. I only wish they were only 24/7 so I can grab one after leaving the club. Thumbs up!",

Well believe it because my friends and I were starving upon entering. The place was pack, but we were seated promptly.   The burgers here are divine. Excellent in flavor. Gourmet, simple, call it whatever you want,  the burgers are definitely worth it. I ordered the Captain Hook and the salmon was grilled perfectly. Not at all overcooked. The Herb Caper Mayonnaise is good, but if you are not a mayonnaise person ask for it on the side. The fries are just as delicious, you can choose between steak fries or shoestring. The steak fries are fatty. I ended up cutting off the ends and squeezing the potatoes out. Mmm, just like mash potatoes.   The seasoned popcorn is what they give you as appetizer. I believe it is tossed with vinegar and cheese. Different, but tasty.  And if you want some booze in your shake, this place has it covered! I was not too inspired to try one, but the options sound just as good as the burger.  We left very stuffed. Too stuffed that we looked rather unflattering in our night clothes. Haahaa. Nonetheless, I will dine here again!",

    "text": "On our recent visit to Las Vegas, we were looking for a substantial lunch that would hold us over through the afternoon, past a show, to a late night dinner.  Our friends had recommended Holsteins, and as fans of Burger Bar and other fancy shmancy burger joints, we were eager to try out the menu.  Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan, we arrived around 11:30 and were promptly seated at a nice corner table in the middle of the restaurant.  I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary, which was made with jalepeno and cilantro infused vodka, served with a big old shrimp on top.  Spicy and delicious!  Our waiter (who was very good) brought us a bag of complimentary popcorn as we perused the menu  This place is really known for their burgers, as they well should be, but don't ignore the appetizers!  We wanted to try so many of them, but we settled on the \"Sausage and Peppers\" Potsickers and the Mexican Car Bombs (jalapenos stuffed with cheese, corn, and black beans, then wrapped in bacon).  The potstickers were unique and delicious, but the car bombs... O.M.G.  Sooooooo spicy, but so flavorful and delicious.  These things are no joke, they are very hot, so if you are a wimp when it comes to spice, these are not for you.  But we absolutely loved them.  For our main course, we decided to split a burger and another appetizer (I know I know, but we had to last 9 hours until our next meal!)  I had the Surf and Turf Quesadilla, which contained steak, lobster, Manchego Cheese, and bacon lardons, served with an aioli sauce.  Very yummy.  For our burger, we had such a hard time choosing, but we decided on the El Machete, described on the menu as \"Beef Patty, Fire Roasted Anaheim Chili, Borracho Onions, Pepperjack Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Spicy 'Machete' Aioli\".  The beef was medium rare as requested, and was perfectly juicy and delicious.  The burger overall wasn't as spicy as I was expecting, but maybe my taste buds were burned out from my spicy bloody mary and the jalepeno pepper appetizer.  Either way, it was good good beef.  We finished with a \"grown up\" milkshake... the Campfire S'mores, which I only had a few sips of because I was so full, but those couple tastes were very good.  They will also make it to go for you if you'd like.  Overall, we were thrilled with our lunch at Holsteins and it may be our new favorite burger place in Las Vegas.  Oh, and it definitely did the job of holding us over until dinner time.  We will definitely be back!",

Plus, the hostess was just kinda bitchy in general... It really dampened the mood.    Thankfully, our waitress was nicer and pretty on top of everything. We tried both kinds of fries and neither were great, but their chocolate milkshake just made it into my top three ever.   My \"Longhorn\" burger was delicious, but it would have been plenty of food if it were just a beef brisket sandwich, but of course there was a huge burger patty on there too... seriously filling.  Jim G. really summed it up great when they described the atmosphere as \"bordering on douchey\" ... It doesn't help that they are inside the drunk-girl trendy Cosmopolitan hotel, right next to the dayclub/nightclub.",

Their selection of food is comprehensive, and all our stuff was delish. We had a Machete with chicken, and Tuna sliders wrapped in lettuce. The chicken meat was tasty and cooked to perfection, with nice smoked mayo on the side. My Ahi tuna sliders were perfect little rectangles of tuna evenly cooked on the outside and perfectly raw on the inside. Spicy mayo went well. Refreshing breakfast.  I just wish I tried the alcoholic shakes(I normally hate shakes), because they l and looked amazing with all the chocolate and oreos and liqueurs....welll, till next time!

Lobster Rolls-served on mini hot dog style buns, filled with a lobster filling-it was okay but couldnt taste the lobster, you got 2 mini's for $14, Lobster Mac-n-Cheese was incredible & I would order a full size order for myself! The Gold Standard burger was cooked to perfection and you cant go wrong with bacon on it! We passed around a few different milkshakes and they were very good.

We were lucky that we were able to get a table right away but were prepared to wait if we needed to.

My boyfriend and I ordered: the Lobster truffled mac n cheese, street tacos, the rising sun, korean \"bull\"gogi, a vanilla malt shake, and a drunken monkey shake.  what we loved: street tacos, the rising sun burger with shoestring fries, and the drunken monkey shake.  This was our last meal before we had to leave vegas. We absolutely loved the experience, loved the food, and most of all, loved the service. Our server was very tentative and nice. The manager was there to make sure everything was going good.  I think this is a must try! I think everything is reasonably priced and even if you're not into burgers, go there to grab a shake to go :]",

I hate that I have to partially drive on the strip to get here as a local, but it's so worth it to me every time.   Buffalo Chicken Dip is a must try; looks funky, texture is different, but it's so delicious. All of their shakes are TDF.  Also try their homemade ketchup!",

It has to be in my top 3 burgers of all time.  Love this place!!!   Their meat patties are just the right about of juicy (geez, salivating thinking about it). Not sure if its high fat content or what, but I really don't care, it's too good. Cheese is perfectly melted. If you are a mushroom fan, definitely check out the Funghi burger. Freakin' awesome. The fries are the right width and the right amount of crispy.   Also, their shakes are great! Vegas is all about the booze. It's not too strong and you can't really taste the alcohol (I had the Drunkin' Monkey), but I could tell it was there. That's the sign of a good drink, haha.   Prices are a bit high for a burger - but it's Vegas - what'd you expect?  Besides, win it all back at the tables. Good luck!   **If you're not that hungry or don't want to be super full, split a burger and a shake. :)",

Both were good burgers with interesting flavor combinations. Sweet potato fries and onion rings were both great also. All in all can't complain about the food, just painful to pay ~$18 for a burger.",

    "text": "Our first interaction in Holsteins came via our douche-tastic waiter who, upon our sitting, proclaimed, \"HEY! WHAT'S UP???!\" My English boss, with his best sarcastic manners, responded, \"Well, hello?\"  Though I didn't catch his name, waiter-man-boy was annoying and slow. He never brought the promised samples of beer, proclaimed Boddingtons (an English bitter) was a white/wit beer and took so long to bring extra cranberry sauce for the sawdust-dry turkey burger I ate, it was long choked down before he reappeared.  Beyond service, the food wasn't substantial, but some in our party loved their burgers.  Kettle Chips - like any other kettle chip. Southern Fried Chicken Fingers-n-Waffles - Nice crisp to the chicken, syrup was warm and the waffle was.... well, a waffle. New England Turkey - Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Dry like the dessert we were sitting in. The Classic - Juicy and medium-rare. The Longhorn - Meat-lovers delight. Duck, Duck, Goose - Rich and hearty. Korean 'Bull' Gogi - The egg was unnecessary and added nothing extra. 'Big Fat Greek' - Creamy and dreamy.  Duck Fat Fries - Didn't taste any different than the shoestring fries that came with our burgers. Truffle Popcorn - Tasted like butter with no hint of truffle.  Maybe it's a hit or miss type of place, but one thing's for sure: our party all agreed - the best 'dish' of the evening was the Frozen Grasshopper alcoholic milk shake. It was smooth mint ice cream with bits of chocolate and a peppermint meringue on top with just enough 'buzz' to make you remember this wasn't your average kid's treat.",

My boyfriend and I went to Vegas during EDC weekend and we wanted to stop by for a quick bite at Holsteins  the wait was super long so we decided to just sit in the lounge area where we thought we could easily just grab a QUICK bite and leave, but little did I know it was going to be the WORST EXPERIENCE ever.  i had the Gold Standard which was pretty good, but the SERVICE was AWFUL.  our waitress first took forever to come greet us, then took like 20 minutes to get us water and get our orders. finally we eat and then afterwards, we wanted to leave because we were in VEGAS and didnt want to waste time sitting here. we waited and waited and saw the waitress for the table next to us at least 3 times and NEVER saw ours. finally we asked the other waitress to get our waitress but again she never came. the host stand was near our table and he noticed that we were waiting so he went to go get her. again, another 10-15 minutes go by and she doesnt show. the host obviously feels bad and goes to get her again and finally the waitress shows, no apology or anything, just drops off the check and leaves. we wait for her to come back to get our card and she disappears AGAIN. finally some random employee comes and grabs our check and we leave... we literally ate in like 20 minutes and waited 45min-1hour just to pay and leave.  the waitress was SO RUDE and this was absolutely the worst meal and service i had in vegas.. the waitress who was waiting the tables next to us seemed very quick so maybe we just got stuck with the awful one.",

I don't know why, but they were distracted and just not very nice. Not rude, just not nice.  We had multiple waiters but one in particular who was dressed differently than anyone else in all black was probably someone special like the manager or something. He was super nice and VERY helpful when it came to ordering our food. I wanted to leave him a bigger tip but we weren't sure who would get it so we just left a 15% tip. I would not have left that much though if it wasn't for him. Service was slow and needed repeating multiple times. By chance, one of my friends and his girlfriend were seated next to us. She asked for her food to go. She got it and then asked for her check. By the time she got her check (which she had to ask for again) she had finished the food she had gotten \"to go\".  The food was really good. I ordered the Duck Duck Goose because nice-waiter-guy said it was the most popular and very gourmet. Maybe so, but I didn't enjoy it that much. The taste was weird to me and it was kind of dry.  The Rising Sun on the other hand was completely excellent to me!!!! So much and many flavors. If you've read my other reviews, I'm all about many flavors!!! ----------get this!  Sweet potato fries were okay. I still haven't had really amazing SPF anywhere.  Strawberry shake was okay. Would not order it again.  I would come back here for the rising sun burger.   Also, I'm really tired of loud, \"fun\" restaurants. I hate having to yell to talk.",

I live in L.A. and I keep begging my dad to take me to Las Vegas just for that burger.  After my Holsteins visit, I dropped by Gordon Ramsey's BurGr restaurant at Planet Hollywood. I got one of their burgers and it was surprisingly nowhere near as good as Holsteins burgers. Plus the service took forever and we had to wait in a huge line. But dam did they have some good truffle fries.  I could tell that Holsteins took pride in their burgers. Also the service was fantastic and the waiters and waitresses were all very nice. If you want the best burger in the world. Go to Holsteins!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am not a \"cool\" person, so when I approached Holsteins for dinner I thought I would feel out of place.  It turned out to be a very enjoyable, memorable experience.  The restaurant is on the second floor of the chic Cosmopolitan hotel which is packed with the young and hp on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, and the hostess was not accepting names for a table.  However, we were told we could wait in the bar area and visit her again in a half hour to inquire about a table.  I'm not sure if this is typical, but it seems like a smart business decision on their part -- to get the guests into the bar to buy drinks first.  It worked for my party.  We actually ordered two appetizers from the bar: fried green tomatoes and lobster macaroni & cheese.  Both were excellent, but the macaroni and cheese is other worldly good.  Holstein's \"adult\" shakes all sounded incredibly delicious -- about ten to fifteen listed options including everything from Cap'n Crunch to chocolate covered pop rocks.  I settled on their \"brown cow\" which has root beer, vanilla ice cream, pop rocks and rum.  It was wonderful.  After about 45 minutes in the bar, we finally got a table in the restaurant.  I got the \"gold standard\" burger which -- though not fancy -- was delicious.  The three people in my party each ordered different burgers and different fries (shoestring, steak and sweet potato).  We shared and loved it all.  With dinner, I had the red sangria which was wonderful.  I tried my friend's white sangria which was light and refreshing.  I would definitely recommend Holsteins and would return the next time in Las Vegas.  Final word to the wise: the bar is LOUD.  The music is cranked so incredibly high that I am shocked hotels across the street couldn't hear it.  Conversation in the bar is strained at best.  Once in the restaurant, the music is less assaultive, but the wood-clad restaurant is also naturally loud.  This is a fun restaurant -- but not one to relax and converse in.",

Which is awesome because you can still mingle in the casino or if you have a longer wait could even go back out to the strip. They told us 25 mins & I believe it was about that long.. wasn't paying attention.  The restaraunt is huge which is good. They were not that busy at all. It was a Friday around 2:30 p.m. buuuuuut for some reason it still took at least 10-15 mins to be greeted & get our drink order taken. Then at least another 10 to get our water. And when all your going to order is water.. that suxs sitting there thirsty & waiting!  Ordered Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls for an app. Very tasty & perfectly cooked. the roll part was more like won ton eggroll wrap not the thick kind of wrap. The 'udder' sauce they serve with it compliments it perfectly!  Ordered the burger that had coleslaw & bbq pork on it.. YuM! forgot to order chesse on it but didn't even notice. ordered it med well & was cooked to perfection. I had a salad as my side & it was great. Husband ordered ff.. nothing special.  No room for dessert.. plus it was my bday so had to save room for cake..lol. But we'll be back for their \"boozled\" milkshakes :)",

Service was prompt, friendly and excellent.  Draft choices are outstanding and our very knowledgeable server was able to competently answer all questions.  So -- why the three stars?  The food. Just not up to the quality necessary when you are charging 16-30 bucks for a burger. The burger was good---- not very good or great. The worst part?  Frozen out of the food service company bag French fries.  Limp and greasy. Worst still?  You can pay extra to \"upgrade\" to the equally frozen out of the bag onion rings!  Heavily battered gummy coated frozen onion rings.  Yuck. Don't get me wrong--- the fries and rings  were cooked fine---but-- if you are charging  these prices-- and hold yourself out as a restaurant of quality and not a fast food burger joint\"----make your own  fries and onion rings!   Or don't serve them at all. I complained about the frozen onion rings and they were quickly removed from our check.  We did not have the adult shakes for which they are known. Saw others enjoying them and they looked good.  Overall--- I think you can do better for a great burger on the Vegas Strip.m",

After we were told that we had to be split into 2 tables for 10 minutes we asked the hostess to check if tables could be combined and it took 30 seconds to realize that tables could be combined. Great news but why were we told that we couldn't before checking? One reason we went here was because friends wanted the urth burger. We asked the waiter to confirm that it was not soy based and he said \"yes it is mostly soy based\". This came as a surprise since last time our friends were here the cook ensured our friends that it was not. After requesting that the waiter check with the cook, he confirmed that it was not soy based. Both the food runner and server had issues keeping the orders and split checks straight. I had the steak house burger and It was okay but the flavor was lacking and the salt was intense. My wife's burger had to be sent back since the order was not made correctly. We all had a good time but there is room for Improvement on all ends.",

I honestly enjoyed people watching because the line up for the Marquee nightclub is right in front of this restaurant. The food was quite good although we could only order from the appetizer menu because it was around 1am. I do remember this place being quite pricey though. This is Vegas, what place isn't pricey right?",

We also ordered the lobster mac&  cheese which when brought to the table made us laugh because the serving was so tiny. I ordered a \"specialty\" cocktial, I don't remember the name but it was made with ginger ale. And all 5 sips were tasty. Just wish I had more sips for the price. I would have given this restaurant only 1 star but since the burger was so good I'll give it a solid two.  Psst...if you want a good burger and better choices. I recommend the SkyBox Sports Grill & lounge located in Aria. For the same price they have a much larger portion. The burger is just as good and they have the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had!",

I also loved how you can still get the vegan patty (or whichever patty you want) and then you can go with the other toppings. I tried the Urth burger and it was yummy but my favorite was the truffle mushroom burger with the vegan patty. Yum!  Definitely come by. My friends who ordered the regular burgers LOVED them. One of my friends got the banana cream pie shake and we all tried it. One word: WOW!  If you plan on getting one, leave room...it is large and they give you the extra that won't fit in the glass in a separate steel cup.  I was impressed that they gave my friend the rest of her shake in a plastic cup so she could drink it later.  Gotta love Vegas!    Excellent food and location.  You can't beat that! Two thumbs up!",

It truly is my favorite hotel/casino on the strip!      I was told to try the buffalo chicken dip but couldn't really see myself eating it, so I opted for the \"Philly\" egg rolls and ahi poke tostadas. The egg rolls, although non-traditional, are my new favorite! If I am ever craving a Philly cheesesteak I would choose these over a messy sandwich any day! The ahi poke tostadas were good, nothing out of this world. The tostada was nice and crispy and the avocado aioli was perfectly portioned for each serving. I am used to fresh-off-the-boat Florida seafood so I guess I should give Vegas a little slack in that department considering you can't catch tuna in the middle of the desert.     Since I wasn't incredibly hungry I ordered the dulce de leche swirl cheesecake to go. I ended up having this for breakfast the next morning so I most definitely enjoyed the corn flakes garnish. As an added touch, they put the caramel sauce and corn flakes in little side containers so my cheesecake would be fresh and not soggy.       I wish I had a bigger appetite so that I could have tried one of their alcoholic milkshakes. I will definitely be back to test one out!",

Considering that their milkshake(booze or no booze) it's $9 and $13 if it is, that's just way too expensive even if it does taste good. Obviously recommend the Cookies and cream and they even serve you the rest in an other cup since it doesn't fit the whole cup.  The burgers are okay. I got the longhorn burger and it was too heavy. The sauce was kinda drench making the buns a bit too drench. I had a bite of the Nom Nom Burger, I would recommend that a lot more. Still, bachi's burgers are a lot better and more fresh imo.",

Two people can share one as it makes two large milkshakes for the amount that they give you. So why three stars? Unlike my friends, who had their sirloin beef burgers with bacon and cheese that were apparently out of this world, I ordered the big fat Greek Lamb burger, as it is called. It was terrible! Seriously gross. I love Greek food and I love lamb, but this just wasn't right. The sour cream and yogurt and the lamb Patty that they put together just did not work. There was an odd taste to it that was just foul. I am really disappointed by this because a burger joint should be phenomenal and any burger that it offers. This burger would disappear from the menu if I had my way. The ambience is very nice and the service is very friendly. Realize that it is not cheap. It is not overly expensive either, but for two burgers and two milkshakes, the price came out to about $60. There was no alcohol involved in this price. I will go back but will probably try the sirloin burger or the veggie burger,  although I'm nervous to try the veggie burger if I have the same experience as I did with the Lamb burger. Regardless, I will go back and I hope I have a better experience.",

Mine didn't taste like alcohol unlike my friends so I was able to drink mine much quicker than her. However after feeling pretty good with myself for finishing most of it I remembered I still had a metal cup with left over shake in it that pretty much refilled my whole glass, as well as that I still had the giant ice cream cookie that came on top of it to eat!  They look fantastic but they are huge so could have been worth sharing one. You can also ask for them without alcohol if you want.  The table next to us got the special Halloween/Fall shakes that are covered in candy corn they looked great!  Make sure to taste the free popcorn when you order food, it tastes so good!",

While the other yelp reviews give the place 4 stars, my experience didn't live up to this expectation. This was mostly due to the lousy service that we received. Our service wasn't terrible and our server was nice, but we had to ask for the complimentary popcorn to be brought to our table and ask on multiple occasions for our water to be refilled. In general, our waiter wasn't rude, but didn't seem to care about our experience here.   The menu is very unique though and the food that we tried was good. I wasn't in the mood for drinking, but the adult shake menu looks amazing. I was eyeing the turtle cheesecake shake, because who doesn't want to just drink a cheesecake with booze in it? My boyfriend and I were just in the mood for burgers so we ordered the Rising Sun, which had kobe beef with yam, teriyaki sauce, and tempura avocado and the Longhorn burger with brisket, BBQ sauce, and cole slaw. I was actually slightly disappointed with the Rising Sun burger, but the Longhorn one was delicious. We got regular fries and sweet potato fries and these were good, but not amazing. We had good burgers here, but unfortunately the high expectations that I had were not met. I'd give this place another try and I'd definitely come back for one of those shakes!",

I tried the Rising Sun Burger -- kobe beef, tempura alvocado, fried yam, and sweet teriyaki sauce. Super flavorful and the meat was cooked to perfection. Our fries were so good too; perfectly fried.   I wish I could try everything on the menu, including the milkshakes. I heard the shakes have alcohol in them, which could be interesting. Or gross.

First plus, it came out promptly, second plus, it was truly medium - pink and juicy. There could have been more yam crisps, and the burger was just on this side of salty, but the tempura avocado and awesomeness that was the steak fries made up for those demerits.  As others have mentioned, truffle oil popcorn is served for the table - a classy touch on a \"plain\" snack. There're several dessert options in addition to the shakes, but the \"lollipops\" one we tried was just good vs great. I'd follow the suggestion from the restaurant's title and stick to the shakes (the strawberry cheesecake w/absolut was my fave of the ones we tried).",

Interesting they were fried spears vs. fried slices like I'm used to but I liked that part.  I got the gold standard burger and didn't really like it (esp. for $20).  It was a bit greasy, needed seasoning, and when I asked them to add avocado they added guacamole to it (not the same!).  I probably would try something else before coming back.",

    "text": "Any place there's a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar, I'm there.  Holstein's was a great find last night, after countless hours of scouring the Yelp site for something other than sushi.  I was ready for a change, for a new spot to grab a burger, and when I saw the reviews for Holsteins and it's location, I had to give it a try.    Let me start by saying that the Cosmo itself is beautiful, and this place makes it even better with a pink and white cow in the middle of the bar.    I made reservations through their website (highly recommended) for dinner at 9pm.  Late?-Sure, but it prevents us from eating with the regular dinner crowd.  We arrived and were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us immediately a corner half booth.  The ambiance is really comforting and chic, which I love.  With the chocolate leather seating to the bright colored tiles aligning one wall and picture-framed tv's, it's metrosexual.  The menu is interesting, too, boasting unique sodas, shakes, and burgers.  Obviously, the menu was in the higher dollar range for a burger considering it is in the Cosmo, but I went all out and ordered what I wanted.    I ordered their newest shake--the cereal bowl--which tasted like breakfast in the morning but in a really fantastic way.  With vanilla ice cream mixed with crushed Cap'n Crunch and Fruity Pebble cereal, it was quite a treat to have, almost like dessert before dinner.  I LOVE IT.  I'm a big cereal person, so this was perfect for me (and it was suggested by the server).  Frank picked up this crazy strawberry soda that was really really good.  I'm going to try and find it at the soda shop on Trop and the 215.  We had the philly spring rolls with tempura pepper slices and ketchup.  It was freakin' great.  The flavors and textures were all on point.  When you combine a philly with a spring roll, magic happens.  Squishy, creamy, gooey cheese oozes out of the end and the ketchup makes it all the better.  We ordered their kettle chips, which had this great bleu cheese salt on them, and the french dip was awesome, too.  Unfortunately, the spring rolls trumped the chips, but they would go great with a beer at the bar, for sure.  I ordered the Rising Sun burger: Kobe beef patty with tempura avocado, crispy yam strings, teriyaki sauce and spicy mayo.  Wow. Just the right amount of sauce and the yams gave it this nice, sweet, spicy flavor and texture.  The meat itself was well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  With that soft, white bun that didn't overpower the meal (it was really light), I believe that I found my favorite burger in Vegas.  Frank ordered the Gold Standard: aged beef patty with guyere (substituted for the aged goat cheese), lettuce, tomato, and onion.  He added lobster, which made it decadent and very flavorful. The sweetness of the lobster accentuated the patty's aged flavor.  It's a winner, for sure.  With no room for dessert, we tapped out with an 81.00 bill, which was expected.  I would definitely eat here again. And again. And again.  If you want to try this place out, do.  There's a lot of try and many days out of the year to do it.",

But the milkshake was really great (I think I had a vanilla shake made vegan) and we don't get many in the UK that are suitable for vegans, so I had a sensory overload. Very good!

    "text": "Aligned with what other yelpers have said the service was below par... The waitress sent out crappy vibes to us the entire night. Our meal started off with her spilling water on one of our friends. Mistakes happen, but what really pist me off was she didn't say sorry right away. Her face had no remorse about the situation and she went to get towels to clean up. Bah. Then later she forgot to get our tables napkins and when she gave us waters she clanked the glass on the table real loud with attitude. Talk about a Debbie Downer. I do not know what this chick's problem was but if I'm going to pay $20 for a burger I expect more. I will say that the manager handled the situation well after my friend spoke to him. He took off his burger and milkshake off our tab.   Wowee! The black pepper was so bomb and the meat was perfectly cooked. I love how the pepper gave the burger a kick to it. I also love that the bun was toasted and not soggy. The bun was also really fluffy in consistency. The shoestring fries were perfect. I stole some sips of milkshakes from my friends and the \"Birthday cake\" was amazing. I would recommend sharing these milkshakes with a friend or you may get diabetes on the spot.   I give this place a 4, but -1 * for the waitress with the bad 'tude.",

Hello, it does not get much better than a delicious creamy milkshake that's, wait for it, alcoholic?!  Oh yes, who knew that a childhood favorite could instantly be upgraded with a touch of adult alcoholism?  So simple, yet so genius...  My favorites among the ones I tried were the Lemon Drop (what lemon meringue pie would taste like if it were a drink - was there even alcohol??), Grasshopper (creme menthe freshness with a healthy dose of chocolate), and Drunken Monkey (PB chocolate banana nirvana).    Cocktails sounded good, and the food seemed like standard hearty bar food ready to satisfy that good ol greasy burger craving.  But do yourself a favor and stop on Floor 2 for the alcoholic milkshakes.  (Then take it with you to the pool upstairs).",

The burgers are fantastic and there are a lot of unique combinations that work very well.    We ordered the \"gold standard\" and the \"rising sun.\"  At $17.50 and $16.50 respectively, these were not inexpensive burgers.  The gold standard features dry aged beef with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and garlic-chive aioli; very very tasty.  The rising sun features kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, cirspy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  I don't think the kobe added anything flavor wise and unfortunately, probably just adds to the cost of the burger.  The tempura avocado however was amazing.  The batter formed a crisp shell and the avocado inside was nice and creamy.  Om nom nom nom.  Are the burgers great?  Yes!  If you think of it as $20+ dinner at the Cosmo, it's not too bad of a deal at all.  Thinking of it as a $20 burger ruins the appetite.",

Our waitress had no authority to do anything about it but agreed it was wrong and seemed upset the kitchen did not cook it to her order correctly.  Out comes the manager who tries to explain it's a thick burger so it's more pink.. ( bummed I didn't get a pic.. But this was red.. And...  Don't you just cook thick burgers longer?!!)  Awaiting a refund for my burger...  Buy still awaiting the check so who  knows..",

I think it's cool that they fill your glass to the rim AND give you the shaker with the \"left over\" shake!  So delicious! We had an appetizer once (maybe fried pickles?) but we literally only stop here for these amazing treats!! There's just no room for food when it comes to these shakes!! Yummy!!!!",

I went back here about a year ago and got a shake and their Gold Standard burger, and wasn't too impressed. In fact, I was disappointed while on my search for the best burger in Vegas. Maybe they had an off day, but everything from the buns, the patty, and all that it came with was average.   Service is great,but I don't think I'll be back. As a matter of fact, it's been a year and I haven't gone back. Didn't even realize I never reviewed this place.",

I was very disappointed. I'm glad I opted out of a burger however, it looked like an unwelcoming, greasy mess. I might come back and try one of their fun milkshakes.

When I needed to request something, I noticed our waiter was having a long chat with the table close to us so I had to flag down other waiters/busboys for refills on water, etc (but barely anyone walked by, mostly to serve your food and then walk away). I understand that sometimes as a waiter, it may be fun for you join in on the convo with visitors from other states. But this was a full blown convo where no one was paying attention to our table when we needed something. Not a great experience. I recommend you eat elsewhere.",

Both me and my fiance's burgers were ordered medium, however both came out very dry and tasteless. It was like they were frozen, quickly cooked too fast and the centers were left cold while the outside looked finished. We asked our server (I forget her name but she was nice) if we could talk to a manager about our experience however he never came by just looked our way and took 15% of our tab. It wasn't that we wanted to complain or expected a free meal, but we both work in industry and expected a little more care from a manager. We definitely won't come back or suggest others spend $80 on low quality burgers and poor customer service",

It has seared salmon and loads of smoked salmon on top with a touch of remoulade sauce. It is surprisingly delicious. The burgers can come with fries, sweet potato fries, or onion rings.

So ridiculous, we got not apology or explanation. In addition, the one burger was ordered \"Medium\" and it came out Medium Rare. Luckily we were able to eat it that way, although it was not preferred. Besides that, the burgers were decent and large but nothing I would brag about.  -If you're asking why we suffered through eating the medium rare burger, its because the service was TERRIBLE and not once did our waiter come to check in on us, for anything.   We really wanted shakes but after the long waits, neglectful service and sub par food, we decided to skip the shakes and just leave.",

Stacked high with grilled onions, lump mushrooms, cheesy goodness, leafy lettuce and truffle mayo- I was sold. The burger did not disappoint and neither did the perfectly crunchy fries on the side. Service was wonderful and no one questioned us when we split the burger and the draft beer with the Yelp deal. Granted we weren't terribly hungry- it was definitely enough to share especially after stuffing our faces with the awesome cheesy spicy popcorn that is served instead of a more traditional bread stater. Prices are high here but the food certainly met those high marks.",

Our stop was for a few quick drinks (which were strong and not incredibly overpriced) and a few appetizers.  Wish I had read previous reviews on the Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Jalapenos. These were nearly impossible to eat due to extreme, mind-numbing levels of heat. Wings on the other hand, not spicy and were fairly good.   I can't even imagine how they'd serve those peppers without a menu note of warning. For the record, I love spicy foods and eat lots of dishes w/ habaneros, scotch bonnets, etc. and these were hotter than any of them.",

When I had it...I was underwhelmed. Something about the flavors just made it feel like a burger with some topics, and nothing really made the thing stick out to be super awesome....that being said, it was entirely eatable and given the prices in Vegas, worth the money. I just wouldn't say it beats out other burgers in town, is all.   That being said....everything else about the place was awesome. I sat down and saw that they had KBS, a pretty darn good stout on tap...and they even had several versions of it from various years. I opted for the oldest one from 2015 without much of a thought (....which ended up costing $25....which is hilarious...but hey, it's damn good beer).    Manager came over, started a talk and even offered to let me try some other stuff as we both started going nuts about being beer nerds. Gotta say I'm really impressed with the staff and more than happy to go back. Gotta try other burgers...and maybe one of those booze-shakes.",

Smoked bacon and creamy goat cheddar were the perfect contrast to the mildly bitter arugula and tomato confit. Sadly, our Tallegio-Mascarpone Mac n' Cheese missed the mark and had to be sent back to its maker. An overwhelming fish sauce pungency was strongly disagreeable with what should've been an umami dish. We really hoped to try their Truffle Lobster Mac, so double disappointment was thankfully mitigated by way of their Frozen Grasshopper shake. A surprisingly inexpensive double shot of pineapple chocolate vodka killed two birds with one stone...sweet and (adult) treat. Yes, the pasta failed, but our hospitable hosts took care of the miscue, and the rest was history. Solid burger, one of the better on the Strip.",

The bucket of buffalo wings were a hit or miss, some pieces were dry and others perfectly cooked. Not sure how that gets done if it goes into the fryer all at the same time, but oh well it did. Didn't get a chance to try their shakes, but they have a pretty decent selection of beers and wine.   There was one red wine in particular, with a funky/artsy label from Italy, that i can't remember the name of, but it was very palatable. If i'm in Vegas again i'll be sure to make a pit stop to try some other stuff.",

The staff was very attentive and hard working for a party of 15.  I was going to get the brisket topped Longhorn burger, but I thought I'd go easy and ended up with the Urth Burger and a Arrogant Bastard Ale by Stone Brewing. The milkshakes were definitely as good as the reputation preceded it. We tried the drunken monkey and the Oreo with Irish Cream. Only thing I didn't like was the burn't popcorn appetizer opposed to the normal bread most places serve. I see what they were trying to do, being different put that one missed the boat. My girlfriend had a good time, I'd like to come back with less people and try some cow next time.",

    "text": "Loooooooved the shake. Maybe it's because shakes are forbidden and I never have them so this one was mind blowing to me but no I think it was just mind blowing in general. Got the Almond Joy. Nutty and coconutty and chocolatey and wow.... couldn't ingest it fast enough.   Burgers were good. Very good. Mine was a little overcooked (really funny coming from me seeing as how I used to eat my burgers like gray pucks but not anymore and this was cooked through when it was supposed to be medium) Only reason it's not 5 star is because in LA there's a place called juicy burger where you can pretty much make your own Hen Burger and it tastes EXACTLY the same (quality and quantity of beef) BUT it's a $5 dollar burger there not 15....so I mean when in Rome....it's not a ridiculous sum for the location. Definitely would go back and service was great",

    "text": "Gonna start with desert.  The adult shakes are incredible espicaly the orange creamsicle (which really taste like a creamsicle) and the brown cow (a root beer float with pop rocks and rum).    The food is typical of  a good gastro pub; new American fusion.  You are rewarded for being adventurous.    The \"Street Tacos\" are made from duck confit, foie gras cranberry relish.  They are incredible.  Other appetizer standouts include the kalbi and kimchee quesadilla, the bull's balls (no they are not rocky mountain oysters), and the lobster corn dogs. The crispy pork belly bun is worth special mention.  Served with hoisin sauce and pea sprouts, its high end dim sum.  Meat in a tube is well represented.  Try the Greek touri.  Different but very flavorful.  Finally, the burgers.  Although I'm still partial to the Burger Bar, Holsteins offerings are very creative and good eats.  Cooked perfectly to order.  The \"Rising Sun\" (teriyaki glazed kobe burger with spicy mayo and tempura avocado) is a winner.  Service is fast and efficient.  One final note, the beer selection is excellent and very reasonably priced for the Strip.",

It was pretty busy but I like the way that they would text you once your table is ready and the wait wasn't bad - less than 10 minutes.   I ordered the Billion Dollar Burger for my mom- and what made it worth $32 was a thin slice of foie gras - that according to my mom made the burger super delicious and juicy...I guess it was a good combination and I was surprised my mom actually finished the whole burger.   I had the Lobster Mac and Cheese - it was cheesy and definitely loaded with lots of lobster. The portion was small but was enough for me. And my dad ordered the Salmon burger but said it was too dry and didn't like it. The fries weren't good either  - it was pretty soggy and worse of all burnt. There isn't really anything on the menu that is under 10 dollars - except of the sides and shakes.   The service was okay. Overall I think it's okay - but I should have tried a burger and shake to make better judgement of the food they are known for - which are burgers - not mac and cheese. so for now it's okay...until next time.",

After a big Saturday night out at STK (I'm not a fan of STK as you can see in my review of the place STK) and then we we were off to Milo's (Milo's was good).. we crashed out at the Cosmopolitan and hit up Holsteins for brunch on Sunday.   Good Burgers and more liquor to the rescue.   Ordering a round of Spicy Bloody Mary's for the group and an order of pizza empanadas got us started. Then it was on the the main course. Burgers!  I had the \"RISING SUN\" burger and upon the up-sell suggestion of our server, I got a fried egg on the burger. I'm a sucker for an up-sell :] This burger was delicious, cooked well, too well in fact, but not dry by any  means (it was ordered med rare, but came out just over medium). No problem though, because delicious wins every time, and it was sooo delicious! Teriyaki flavor, fried egg and delicious tempura fried avocado. It's a lot of what I like about food under one bun.   We had another round of spicy Mary's and then off for a nap. We loved it so much.. we went back the next day! Check it out, it's worth a trip. Happy Eating!",

Most may not find this as a con, but i felt the buns were too much, when i eat a burger i want to taste the quality of the the \"inner sandwich\" in which the bun is holding everything together and gives a mild taste. 3. Drink selection should be more diverse  Overall a good sandwich, ive had better but will do again when back to Vegas!!",

    "text": "This was the worst meal we had in Vegas, made even more disappointing by the fact that it was my birthday lunch.  It started off well - we were greeted promptly and seated quickly without reservations (it was about 1pm on a Friday afternoon).  We entered near the bar on the far end, so it was a little weird when the hostess sent us wandering by ourselves to meet our waitress 30 feet away, rather than have her come and collect us, but OK not a big deal.  We ordered drinks - blood orange cosmo for mom and a grasshopper alcoholic milkshake for me, which lead to being carded and a \"happy birthday\" from the waitress.  All good so far.  The cosmo was quite tasty and the milkshake was almost too decadent.  It was good, but so rich and filling that I immediately thought I had made a strategic error vis a vis my calorie intake for the rest of the day.  There are a variety of burgers on the menu, along with a few non-burger items (not much in the way for vegetarians though).  I went with the gold standard, with onion rings, while mom opted for the basic burger and sweet potato fries - both substitutions incur a slight charge of $1 or $2.  The burgers themselves range from $14 for the basic variety to $28 for one with kobe beef and foie gras.  The ingredients are of good quality, so especially considering the location, the cost would almost be justified except for...  1) they were not correctly cooked; we both ordered medium-well and got medium-rare.  Granted, people have differing ideals of what constitutes medium-well vs. medium-rare but but a burger that is light pink throughout is nowhere near 'well' - medium or not.  2) the biggest sin - the food arrived cold.  The burgers were room temperature and the sides were barely above that and cooled quickly.  We almost sent it back to the kitchen, but had already been waiting close to 45 minutes for it to arrive in the first place and had no interest in sitting there longer.  I ran the rest of my burger through the microwave when we got back to our room and it was quite good when at the proper temperature.  There was no salvaging the onion rings, though.    At $70 for lunch, I should be able to get my food cooked to my specifications and served at a proper temperature for enjoyable eating.  I might come here if someone else wanted to go (and better yet, pay), but I would probably just order a drink and skip the food.  There are far too many good burger places on and around the Strip to risk being disappointed here again.",

    "text": "Holsteins is a must visit when anywhere near the Cosmo.  The burgers are lovely and the beer selection will please anyone looking for \"something light and different\" to go with the heavy-ish fare.   I've visited the place three times now while in Vegas on business and have not been disappointed. As is the case in Vegas... the service is efficient although slightly oblivious in that  the wait staff will put their own priorities in the busy restaurant, above interrupting you mid sentence to \"check if everything is okay\"... but they do check - and the place is always nuts... so I can't really fault it.  I've tried a couple of the burgers and they were quite artful. Had the sliders and milkshakes after an exhausting four day conference and they totally hit home. Yum!  Two of my visits were with large groups and everyone was pleased with their meals. This was all a few months ago so I don't have specific recommendations for the food for you... but our orders were pretty diverse.  The place is super loud and it's a kind of upper-mid-scale-Vegas-Tourist atmosphere. I use the word Tourist because the clientele diversity ranged from families with kids, to frat boys... and despite that, the meal was enjoyable and while the slightly lower scale service was a slight annoyance... It was forgivable given that I was on a business trip with colleagues.  Good for groups of friends looking for excellent burgers, beer and interesting soft-drinks.  Not somewhere I'd ever bring a date to... but that's just me. ;)",

    "text": "After two years, I summoned my courage and came back to this spot for a second meal. Half the restaurant was reserved for a CES crowd so we were informed there is a 45-min wait. No problem, let us grab a drink first... but wait, why are there empty tables in the unreserved section?! No idea. Those tables were still empty when we left the restaurant after our meal an hour later, so maybe they're reserving them for the POTUS. Yeah right.  Let's get down to the real stuff: - Milkshakes are gooood. The oreo one especially hit the spot as a nice malt/bailey's shake. Noted that it wasn't as alcoholic as Black Cow or Brown Cow. - Burgers... oh burgers - where do I even begin? Should I start with the fact that I had to send the burger back because it was well done, dry and gritty instead of medium-rare and juicy? The replacement was barely better (came medium-well) but at that point I was so disappointed that a burger place can't get the temperature right that I ate it as sustenance rather than something to be enjoyed and savored. Bun is also hard so watch out for that too. The only burger that was moderately impressive is the Rising Sun which has a nicer patty and a lovely blend of flavors. If you're thinking about the Gold Standard, SKIP IT.  I'm going to wait another two years before contemplating another visit. Maybe.",

My fiance and I sat at the bar/lounge area because we wanted quick service so please note I'm only reviewing my experience at the lounge area.  They still offer the dinner menu.    Food and Drinks:  Ahi Sliders  Steak Fries - comes in pail  Miller Lite Beer - poured from can Spicy Bloody Mary  Bloody Orange Cosmo   The Ahi Sliders comes in 3 and were presented just like any regular red meat sliders.  I thought it was fun to have Ahi Tuna in slider form.  The buns were sweet and easy to bite into (kind of reminded me of King's Hawaiian Bread) and inside the buns, there were Asian-styled pickled veggies (carrots, cucumbers, etc).  It also came with chilli mayo sauce if you like your food on the heavier side.  I did not find the sauce a bit spicy.  5 stars for just the steak fries!  I mean, how were each single fry perfectly seasoned, warm, and crispy?  I hope it wasn't just luck that we got the most perfect tasty fries.  I started off with a Spicy Bloody Mary (peppered and cilantro infused).  It really was spicy and I do have an insane tolerance for spiciness compared to others.  As for the bloody mary part, it was okay.  The Bloody Orange Cosmo was a great way to cleanse my palate.  It tasted fresh just as it appeared.  I felt that they were generous with the amount of alcohol that came in both cocktails.    Service: I lose track of the date and time in Vegas but it must have not been during prime dinner time because we immediately sat ourselves but towards the end of our meal/drinks, I noticed it does get really crowded.  Really friendly and prompt staff!  Our server would give us her personal input on our selection and because I liked everything I got, her comments felt genuine.    Other notes:  We sat in individual lounge seats - comfortable and roomy.  You can also view the game playing at Cosmo's Sports Book directly across if you get the exterior seats.  When we were ready to leave, I asked if we can take our drinks across in order for my fiance to finish his sports bet games ... our server was kind enough to pour them into plasticware.  Later during my stay at Cosmo, I learned that you can easily access this side of the casino right off the 2nd floor of the guest elevators.    If I stay at the hotel again, I would definitely given Holstein's a second try!  I will try one of their burgers and other cocktail selections.",

They have a nice selection of different burgers each with a different spin. I had the kimchi burger and was really impressed. Very flavorful with the sweet sauce and crunchy kimchi and the bun was soft and sweet. The sweet potato fries on the side were nothing special. Just anyplace frozen kind. Would have been nice to have some banchan instead, but it's a burger place :p My friends were also nice enough to share the gold standard burger w tomato & arugula--very peppery. The delhi chicken sando--mild Indian flavor. The salmon--lots of salmon for the seafood lover. I liked the pickled shallots. Wanted more of them! Other than the food the atmosphere is laid back, waitstaff fine, not in your face. It's a bit expensive, but it's Vegas! I'd go back~",

    "text": "This place is way overrated. I'm sorry; everything was perfect-- the service, the atmosphere-- except for the food.  The burgers were ridiculously large and kinda dry, so our beagle was burdened the task of eating those. I ordered the Big Fat Greek (obv a Greek ingredient inspired burger) and the lamb burger was massive and juicy yet overwhelmingly onion-y. My mom split the Steakhouse Burger with my grandma, and she said it was pretty decent. My sister got some random burger. Buns were lame and plain.  Ordered onion rings on the side for an extra $2.50-- super dry and mostly breading.  The shakes were good, but not $9-$13 good.  We also tried the lobster/truffle mac n cheese, which was one of the more delicious parts of the meal.  For 3 burgers, an appetizer, 2 milkshakes, and a coke, we paid approx. $120. Just no. The food was decent, and the shakes were really delicious, but it is kinda way too expensive in my opinion.  Our waitress was really sweet, and the place had wonderful decor and mood. Just wish the food kept up with all of that.",

Lucky for me, I was hungry but even then I barely polished it off. I made absolutely no dent in the fries but I don't normally care for them anyway.  As for the burger- big, juicy, perfectly cooked. The toppings were really a bonus at that time. IMHO, this is something you probably want to split with someone especially if you're considering a shake to go with it. It's massive!",

I totally didn't expect to find this place on The Strip: -grassfed burgers -the option of a (delicious!) gluten-free bun -a wide variety of ciders (and good ones too--not the syrupy sweet ones) -friendly, down-to-earth servers  After a week of the bright lights, I was getting a little tired of all the glamour, mediocre food choices, and everyone's lack of understanding about FRACKING GLUTEN. And then Holsteins came into my life. Sure, there might be a flashier burger spot from a celebrity chef who likes to scream a lot, but Holsteins is just what this Ohio boy needed.  The prices are a bit high, but they're pretty much on point with similar high-quality burger spots. So if you're looking for a cheap meal (why are you in LV?), don't come to Holsteins.   As for me, I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "Been hearing all about Holsteins and the all natural, hormone free premium beef they use for their burgers so you know I just had to see what this higher end burger joint was all about.  My burger was Kobe Beef glazed in Teriyaki sauce and topped with Furikake, and crispy yam that were shaved into long thin ribbons..I did take a picture but the photo turned out too dark. The burger was real lean, no dripping grease, but lacking in the seasonings for my taste.  I did like it but just the burger by itself was a just a bit bland for me. Mr.B  approved the Longhorn burger.  It was their beef burger with beef brisket.    Also a winner was the Crispy Pork Belly Buns in the Little Buns (aka sliders) section.  The buns were pressed Chinese buns. The pork belly skin was crisp and the meat was tender.  I was very pleased with the hoisin sauce that topped it. Mildly sweet and a good complement for the pork belly.   Servings were big..and so were the prices, but well worth the expense. Ambiance wise, casual although the front lobby area is really LOUD.  I couldn't hear even myself talk! Nor anyone else for that matter. I don't know how their hostesses handle repeating themselves all day long.  Our servers were did great for being super busy that evening. The quoted wait time to be seated was 15 minutes, but we didn't wait that long at all.   They have some fun booze shake flavors but I wasn't in the mood for it since I already had my fill of sweets earlier in the day. Most definitely will come back and make it a point to try them since this place is a keeper for our lunch dates.",

    "text": "Came here on what seemed to be an uneventful and random Tuesday night with another guest. We luckily snagged a dining area right up front from the hostess stand while the other current diners were just leaving. Apparently the restaurant was packed and quite eventful despite our feelings otherwise.  The table was still full of food, given the fact we were offered the only available seating at the time, but service was very quick to remove and set up for us promptly.   We decided on the Fun-Ghi burger & the crispy pork belly buns. For desert, we were recommend the Tiramisu shake based on our preference of chocolate. We even got it to go and non-alcoholic. Everything came out surprisingly fast. *The menu is quite extensive so there are many choices for everything. Look online in advance or take a look on the menu outside.  The Fun-ghi was delicious, but I really was expecting more from a 17$ burger. Truffle marinated Portabella mushroom, caramelized onions, frisee, and mayo with a beef patty. Rich and pleasantly mild despite the idea of alluring funky-nees from the truffle and gruyere. Ordered with sweet potatoes fries that were executed perfectly, although they only came with your normal and boring grocery ketchup rather than a unique dipping sauce or aioli that most burger places in its caliber of category offer.  The Crispy Pork Belly buns were such a disappointment. So unpleasantly sweet, as if the pork itself were candied. And to add insult to the matter, the herbs or greens accompanied did not compliment the dish what so ever and gave it a medicinal and rather off putting taste. Terrible really.  Shake was great but not anything special, and again, for the price of 13+?  The service from our waitress could not have been any better. So polite and friendly and frequently checked back on us despite a full house; Impressive. I also believe the owner stopped by at one point and asked us how we were and carried on by removing some trash from our table.  It's the questionable prices and the food quality that contributed to the 3 stars. I understand the atmosphere is apart of the experience (beautiful artsy and urban decor, obviously located in the upscale  and modern cosmopolitan) and leads way into the pricing, but it's quite unnecessary and confusing when the food isn't as up to par. I will be back to try some other burgers, but not planning on it anytime soon.",

RISING SUN BURGER - has Kobe beef and potato chips. Really great. The fries that came with it is just ok. $17.   LOBSTER MAC AND CHEESE - is good. Pretty small for $15.   ONION RINGS - really good. Well cooked. I like it that I can bite into it without it falling apart. Fries come with the burger. Additional $2 to substitute for onion rings or sweet potato fries.   FRIES - weak point of our meal yesterday    OREO SHAKE - pretty good. Not too sweet which I liked.   Compared to other burger joints in town: - Bachi Burger is a bit better. But they're pretty close! - This is better than Gordon Ramsay's BURGR.  - Hard to compare with In N Out because it's classic California, and I'm from Cali. Besides, In N Out is straight up classic cheeseburger, but this one is considered gourmet burger, which is different. They're both great though.   If I'm craving for burger and I'm off the Strip, definitely Bachi. If I'm in Strip, this one. I'll also try Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay in the future.   I'll come back again.",

Everything here fits the part of vegas, female table runners dressed in hot pink mini dresses, contemporary wall designs, awesome service... what more do you want?    I had the chance to try the Korean burger as well as the Smokehouse burger.  The korean burger is freakin money.  It was juicy, flavorful, and satisfying.  I definitely licked my chops after eating a piece of this burger.  The smokehouse burger was good, however, the meat of the burger is a little bit too lean (I don't believe I've ever said that in my life about a burger).  I guess this is also a pro because it was one of the cleanest burgers I've ever eaten.  Not even a drop of meat juice dripped while I ate this burger.  It could come off dry to some, but it was still very tasty.  If you're going to be wearing all white like a player, get this burger.  As for the prices, it's not bad for a vegas restaurant.  They have decently priced draft beers as well as food.  4 stars.",

We order the Black and White malt. It was delicious! My wife ordered the Al Pastor burger, it was huge, but it was also too salty to enjoy eating and wasn't as tasty as the Rising Sun. The fries were crispy, but sadly they were also lukewarm. The server was really friendly and attentive. They offered us burgers to go to make up for the salty ones we had, but we declined and said we didn't need anything, we just wanted to make them aware of the situation. They did give us 15% which was nice of them. They also said they were making adjustments to the way they were salting the food today. The service added one star to this review. With so many good choices in Vegas we doubt we will be back.",

    "text": "If you have any food allergies or intolerances, do not go here. The staff and managers had absolutely no knowledge about food allergies. Our party had two serious food allergies to be concerned with, not just diet choices, but actual allergies. We let our server know ahead of time what those allergies were - gluten/wheat (for a celiac person) and shellfish. The server said the sweet potato fries were gluten free and not fried in the same oil as anything with fish or shellfish. The calamity of events that happened after this was not only frustrating and annoying, but could have been downright dangerous and life-threatening. Three different servers and two managers told us multiple conflicting things about what menu items contained what, then argued and disagreed with each other in front of us. They had to pull out packages to check what the ingredients were and show us the boxes at the table because nobody had any idea - not even the chef. They had no knowledge of what gluten is. One server argued that all potatoes inherently contain gluten. I told him that is False. He replied that potatoes have starch and anything with starch has gluten. I was shocked. We were told there were separate areas in the kitchen for seafood, and then another server said the same utensils were used for everything. We had already eaten the sweet potato fries when a second server said they had gluten. It turns out, according to the package because they were frozen, they do not. But this was after an initial panic and upset about what that could mean. The first manager was indignant and never once apologized. We were never seeking any consolidations (which they never offered or provided), but rather just for them to know if they are in the restaurant industry they can't have staff making definitive declarations about food allergies if they aren't absolutely sure. There should be training on this for all employees about what menu items contain what allergens. That is a common question for diners and can have serious consequences if someone is uninformed or uneducated. We never received an apology. Only excuses and blame on others. Then we asked to speak to the general manager because the situation was ridiculous. He was drunk. He was actually sitting at the bar drinking and when he spoke to us appeared and smelled visibly drunk. He didn't apologize either, just told us that the situation was noted and that he was busy with other things. The entire experience was shocking and miserable. Never again. Beware if you have food allergies.",

I didn't try the shake/float section of the menu, but the majority of our table did and everyone was raving about those too. They did look good, just wasn't really feelin it. The Holstein's special brew beer or whatever it was called (had Holstein's in the name) was very good too. I was shocked to find a locally brewed beer in Vegas that was that good. Damn I miss that burger though. Need a Holstein's in San Jose next plz =) Was a little pricey or it would have gotten 5 stars.",

Sunrise burger delicious as well as the BULLgogi burger, FANTASTIC!!! Salmon burger was so-so, wouldn't order it again. And sweet potato fries were soggy. Service was good. Music bumping! Great overall experience, perhaps bcz I ordered the pork belly buns and BULLGogi no fries w/a side salad! :)",

When I came the atmosphere was a bit trendy and I got seated right away. The waitress was nice and took our order right away. I ended up getting the Golden Stantdard. The patty (made from aged meat) was nice and juicy (I ordered my medium rare)...and the toppings were just awesome and balanced the burger. I was a little weary since it came with goat cheddar but it ended up being really good...so good you don't even need to open that ketchup bottle. The fries (steak fries) were seasoned to perfect although I believe it could've came with a few more. Holsteins is becoming a MUST everytime I come to Vegas!!!",

    "text": "Went here with a friend tonight. First of all, the setting was very nice with a animation-esque theme. The hostess told us that we could sit at the bar or the dining area, both of which have tvs. I had the Gold Standard burger ($18.50) and my friend had the big fat greek burger($18) with $2 sub sweet potato fries. We also shared the Tiramisu shake ($13). When the shake came out, our waiter gave us a steel mixing cup and a glass cup with the shake. I was wondering what that steel cup was and when I looked inside it was more of the shake. I guess they made extra and they were courteous enough to give the rest of it to us. The shake was pretty good and less sweet (thank God) than the shakes at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. The burgers came out pretty quick (maybe in 10-15 minutes). It wasn't that busy so that helped. The fries come out in a small, aluminum bucket which is kinda unique. The Gold Standard burger was great. I liked especially the arugula and the tomato confit. Those veges balanced the heavy flavors of the bacon, cheese, and burger. Unfortunately, I noticed the fries at the middle and bottom of my bucket were a little soggy and oily. I tried my friend's greek burger which had greek spiced lamb. She had the tsaziki sauce on the side and I thought that was a good decision especially for this burger. The sauce had mint in it and my friend didn't like it. I, on the other hand, thought it worked bc I've hand lamb with mint jelly before. My friend told the waiter she didn't like the tsaziki sauce and the waiter was kind enough to bring out a cajun remoulade sauce instead. That cajun remoulade sauce was pretty good and tasted like thousand island with some cajun seasoning. My friend's sweet potato fries were great as they were crispy and did not taste oily at all. The service was great and attentive. Even though the burgers were on the pricey side (most were $16-$18), I would come back again bc of the casual setting, fast service, and the yummy tasting burgers and shakes.",

I know they are sliders but I was expecting them a tad bigger and maybe like 3-4 of them instead of two plain bite size burgers and four potato chips? I ended up spending $20 for it with a soda, tax, and tip. I hate spending money on food and leaving unsatisfied!  The people I went with said their regular burgers (I think they ordered the kobe beef) were the best burgers they ever had so I will definitely come back here again to try one of their regular sized ones. Either that or the salmon burger looked real good too. I want to like this place so maybe next time I try it I will.",

What we ordered: Truffle lobster mac & cheese Mini burger bites with steak, foie gras & arugula (2) Mini lobster rolls (2) Onion rings  My first impression when the food arrived at our table was how tiny the portions were for the hefty price tag. Then, I immediately thought to myself that it must be because the food tastes phenomenal. I was wrong. The steak in the burger bites was dry. There was not enough truffle flavor & lobster in the mac & cheese. The lobster rolls were sub par and bland tasting. However, the onion rings were delicious, probably the best I've had. It's kind of sad that the onion rings were the highlight of our meal. There's too many yummy places in Vegas to try...I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Holstein's is such a cute place; I love the little cow! Well, maybe not just \"cute\" - it is also very well designed, spacious, and modern in addition to having a cute little cow as its mascot. But we don't go to places because they're cute, we go for the food, right? My boyfriend and I both ordered the ahi tuna sliders with the fries on the side, and he loved them. I did not like the sliders. They were creatively prepared and looked delicious, however, something about the tuna was off-putting for me. That is just me, though - he gives them rave reviews. Seeing that I had enjoyed a (huge) burger at a different restaurant in Vegas our first night, and ended up at Holstein's because our first choice had a much longer wait, I figured that ahi tuna sliders would give me enough variety and not make me feel like \"ugh, burgers again?\". Enough about my slight dislike of the sliders, though. The fries were amazing, and so was the chili mayo that they came with! Mmmmmmm....such a good combination, just the right mix of sweet and spicy (for the mayo). The service we received was warm, friendly, and enthusiastic (on all fronts, from the hostess to our waitress). I can't wait to come back, because the other dishes that I saw looked incredible and I definitely want to try those out (along with a boozy shake!).",

    "text": "If your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. A group of us came here for a birthday. We called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.  The decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art.   The server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.  The star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.  Starting out with the artichoke \"guac\" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.  Now the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.",

    "text": "We needed a convenient, relatively cheap place to eat and this was right in the Cosmopolitan Hotel (across from Marquee).  There is no way this place could go out of business in this location.  They serve gourmet burgers and spiked milkshakes.  Is there anything you can't get drunk on in Vegas?  The burgers are pretty damn good, but it was really only a better version of Red Robin, with an upgraded (better looking) wait staff.  The essential complement to burgers - the fries - were a disappointment.  They seemed overcooked.  Service was extremely slow, even though there were plenty of empty tables, but our waitress kept us updated.  I had nearly finished my shake by then.    3 stars for now.  This place has potential, but I doubt anyone cares all that much as you can't miss with burgers, fries, and shakes.",

    "text": "So close but so far is all I can say of this new restaurant.  I went with a friend on opening night and everything was perfect; the meat was cooked to order, the toppings were flavorful and well proportioned, the bun was great, and I walked out of there claiming that it might have unseated Burger Bar as one of my favorites (More on Burger Bar in a future article).  The bacon, cheese, and garlic aioli all had great flavor, and didn't compete with each other.  I went back a second time a week later with the always negative writer of our sister site, the Boston Burger Blog, and the meat was very overcooked.  Again the toppings and bun were excellent, but the overcooked meat greatly took away from our experience and flavor.  We both agreed that if the meat was cooked medium-rare as ordered, it would have earned several more points.  Being a restaurant that has a burger and shake theme, this is something that really should be right every time.  But as you know, the burger isn't the only factor taken into consideration.  The fries need work.  The first time I ate there our waiter explained that we needed to get the shoestring fries because they were a clone of McDonalds' fries, and they were.  They were really good, and maybe lacked some of the greasiness that coincide with the big chain's version.  The second time they seemed to be a bit different, and almost seemed to stray towards the lackluster fries of Burger King after the Great Change.  The duck fat fries also seemed a bit better the first time than the second.  Another great item were the 'loaded' shakes; mostly classic flavors and mixes with a good amount of alcohol in each one.  While they are a bit expensive, the few that I've tried have all been quite tasty.  I managed to squeeze a third visit here in the midst of my busy schedule, and this time there were more problems.  First of all, we had a horrible wait for food; people sat after us, ate and left before any of our food arrived to our table.  The restaurant was severely understaffed for some convention that was in town that week.  While I understand that rushes do occur, some careful planning and a bit of coordination with the hotel management to see what kind of occupancies you'll have from week to week would be a good idea.  On top of our wait, I got steak fries instead of shoestring, which isn't a deal breaker, but when I'm supposed to be finding anything wrong with my meal this makes it easy.  Like my first visit, the meat was cooked perfectly so this gives me hope that they might be back to their original form, even with a packed house. My Asian themed burger had great flavor overall, and a little bit of a bite which was welcome.  It came topped with an over-easy egg that was cooked perfectly, and a glaze that had good flavor.  All things considered, this restaurant has already brought me in for three separate visits so there is some merit to that.  But the inconsistencies from meal to meal, combined with the not-so-great service prevent me from bumping this burger to the next level.  It's definitely worth a first time visit, if not just to experience the Cosmopolitan property and take in extreme Vegas opulence.",

    "text": "Over thousand reviews later WHAT could I add?? Well I will give it a go!! In the world of gourmet burgers whether on the strip or venture outside no shortage of quality spots get your burger on...Most part hit all of them exception of Umami or Guy Fieri. The thing that stood out the most for me is the atmosphere at Holsteins Shakes and Buns. It just screams good vibes, family atmosphere (between pasture and pastures of cows everywhere you look) cartoon characters interior decor, and far cry from all the other restaurants in the Cosmo. The prices are reasonable price or should say same like most of the other \"gourmet\" burger places $12-15. They do have the over the top foi gras burgers that not reasonable price.   I came to Holsteins for recovery Volunteer meal after working the RnR Marathon with family. After seeing over 40,000 runners working hard that makes anyone hungry. Thankfully we had reservations cause anything on the strip on RnR day is madhouse. Just made even more impression that the service we had was awesome. The restaurant literally had no empty tables. Yet out waiter was very much on it! He did great job explaining the menu for couple first timers like me. Very attentive once we got our food making sure our glass never empty and checking see if everything was good. We even split the bill with different credit cards but never complain and still had smile at the end of the night.  I ordered the Steakhouse Burger. It was really good. I was leaning towards some of the main stay popular choices. The more keep looking at the Steakhouse Burger not get off it. Their steak house sauce combine with tomato confit, cheese, and more just working out in my head delicious. I got my burger first impression was looks like DAM good burger. Sorry about no picture. I was starving going full volunteer shift my choice no break. It was the perfect recovery meal. The size is nice. It not tiny nor over the top huge burger. All the burgers comes with choice of side. Free side that worth star by itself considering most of the other gourmet burgers spots just paying for the burger. The burger was cooked perfect medium just liked I ordered. The flavors was the perfect combination. Think of it as pepper crusted steak with creamy A1 sauce. Ok. It might not be doing it justice but just giving you idea.   If not in the mood for burgers they got you covered from Salmon Burger (looking good also), veggie burger, or turkey burger. The shakes got to see the birthday cake (think that was it). I passed on the shakes. Talk about list! Am sure if shake fan they got you covered.   Just for the 808. The cows reminded me of meadow gold taking the tour in 808. Cartoon character cows forget the name of two??",

First of all the teriyaki sauce was only on one half of the burger so I ate the other half with ketchup cuz it was so dry. The \"crispy\" yams looked like those noodles that go on salads & they were not crispy & possibly not even yams. Avocado tempura is an interesting idea but then they need to slice the avocado kinda flat so it lays on the burger instead of a giant lump of avocado on half the burger. Bread fell apart & meat was not amazing. Sweet potato fries were also cold. Service was slow. Just very meh.",

Dillon's cool command of exceptional service delightfully set the tone for the evening.  We were in good hands.   The Day Spa was the salve I was seeking, which included, Hendricks gin, muddled cucumbers, splash of St. Germain, juice of a lemon and a lime, topped with club soda.    Onto the poutine, albeit delicious, lukewarm.  French fries with unquestionably the best cheese curds, shredded short rib and stout gravy.    Followed by the lovely Beets & Goat Cheese salad prepared with roasted beets, shaved fennel, frisee, citrus, toasted pistachios, and goat cheese mousse.  Inspired.   Closing with the Gold Standard, dry-aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese (you heard me), tomato confit, baby arugula and garlic-chive aiolo.  The combination worked both conceptually and literally.",

Kid friendly place.  Huge selection of milkshakes that you can order with or without alcohol - I had the pecan turtle one... it probably has as many calories and fat as what I ate for the rest of the day, but definitely a nice treat. Rich creamy ice cream with all the goodness of pecans and chocolate as well! It's about $4 less than the posted price if you order one without alcohol.  Their burger selection is impressive. I sampled hubby's classic gold standard and thought it tasted good. I had the funghi burger and the tastes went well together with a touch of truffle, but it was a bit too greasy for my liking.  Delicious onion rings! Average fries.  Good service and decent burgers but I thought it was a bit expensive for lunch (about $30 pp).",

The best part though was the Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake I ordered.  For the record, I have never ordered anything with Vegan in the title, but this shake sounded so tasty I had to order it.  The shake contained the following:  Coconut Sorbet, Raspberries, Skyy Raspberry Vodka, 3 Olives Coconut Vodka, Toasted Coconut Marshmallow, Soy Whipped Topping  Absolutely delicious!  I almost ordered a second one =)  The place overall was nice and casual and the prices were more reasonable compared to the other places at the Cosmo.  The service was good too!

I called to make the reservation, which went very well, with a very friendly and professional hostess. Upon completing the reservation, she informed me that I would be getting an email to confirm my reservation. Sure enough, only a few minutes after I got the email from the very nice hostess. Attached was a Word Document, and to confirm the reservation they wanted to me scan and email back the front and back of my credit card, AND front and back of my Driver's License, informing me that if I cancelled I would be charged $45 per person, plus tax, so about $500. I don't care about that part, but there is no way I am sending an unsecure email with photos of both my Driver's License and Credit card...I'm surprised they did not request my Social Security card and Bank Information. In all my years of booking business dinner reservations, or any reservations for that matter, I have never had a restaurant request something so ridiculous. Their loss, big loss, of revenue for the evening. Another popular restaurant welcomed my reservation, and only wanted my name and phone number...that sounds about right.  Please review your policies Holstein's.",

Super crisp yet soft interior fries (well you know what I mean...) and fresh side salads.  But, the crazy thing I ordered was the Cookies and Cream shake...whoa!  Get ready for a calorie bomb like eating 4 packets of energy gels topped off with Pinnacle Vodka and ice cream!  I felt so guilty, but couldn't stop drinking the thing, plus they give you extra in a stainless steel mixing cup.  I actually took it to go, made the 106 deg Vegas heat tolerable!",

I know, foie gras is controversial, but the earthiness and creaminess of the goose liver goes so well with the perfectly seasoned burger, the truffle mayonaise and onion marmalade you'd think they were always meant to be served with each other.  For us Angelinos who don't have anymore foie gras, this is just another reason to visit Vegas (though I did hear that a loophole is restaurants can serve it in Ca, they just can't charge for it - i.e., order of hamburger with a complementary slab of fg). It's $28 with a side order of fries and well worth it.  I got the shoestring fries and thought it was a good choice.  If they had served this burger at the council meeting, the bureaucrats would have motioned for dismissal.    Will have to go back to try the Gold Standard, but will probably order the billion dollar burger again anyway.",

It was one of those kind of messy but sooo tasty burgers that you just can't NOT eat in one sitting.   We came in early for lunch on a Sunday before leaving Vegas and it was basically empty. We were sat immediately and within minutes I had eyed one of their seasonal milkshakes (with some booze of course!) a Pumpkin Pie milkshake. Literally SO Good. It had pumpkin pie vodka in it with with pumpkin pie filling, pepitas, and graham cracker crumble. I was literally drinking a pumpkin pie spiked with vodka and it was heaven! Ordered the the \"Fun Ghi\" burger to eat because I'm a big fan of mushrooms and truffle mayo and it was delicious! The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the gruyere cheese complimented the burger really well. The fries it came with were seasoned and crispy as well!   There are a ton of burger joints in Vegas and they are all over priced but I'd rate Holsteins up there as one of the best. I love the cute decor and the trendy atmosphere with its location right in the heart of the Cosmopolitan.",

Everything was big and over exaggerated, which is exactly what you look for in Vegas.  It didn't matter that the food wasn't exactly perfect, it was that they tried and the presentation was fun.  The milkshakes are to DIE for and was really filling and oh so devilishly yummy.   Unfortunately the burger was not so much.  I mean...it IS a burger place.

I like the cartoon paintings they have displayed all over the restaurant!  The hostess seated us right away there was no wait.   When we sat at our table there was complimentary Salt and Vinegar Popcorn ready for us to munch on.  The waiter came by and took our order, I got the Gold Standard Burger and Banana Cream Pie Shake.  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ePeQhxi4sOg-0plQN2J_cQ&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  ::Drinks:: The Banana Cream Pie shake had bananas, vanilla custard, nilla wafers, caramel, creme de banana, liquor 43, and white chocolate covered nutty banana.  I couldn't taste the liquor in the shake, not even a little.  The shake was thick, smooth and delicious.  I would order this shake again!   ::Food:: The Salt and Vinegar popcorn tasted good, it was buttery, tangy and freshly made.   (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xzRa3szQG1_gQO_AFJROog&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  My Gold Standard Burger came with a side of fries and it had Dry Aged Beef Sirloin, with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato, baby argues, and garlic-chive aioli.  It was cooked to perfection, the bacon and patty were juicy and the bun was fluffy.  The fries were a bit soggy so I didn't eat a lot of it.   ::Customer Service:: We got seated next to a group of guys that was talking loud and it bothered me just a little bit.  My friend and I tried to have a conversation but it was hard to because they were so loud.  I tried to tune them out but it didn't' work so my friend spoke to the hostess. The hostess said there were no tables available and the only one she could move us to was a table that was behind the group of guys  ....(Really?!?!). We said never mind and sat at the same table.  A few minutes went by and I couldn't stand it anymore. When John checked on us, I told him that I was not happy about sitting at this table because the guys next to us were so loud that my friend and I can't even enjoy each others company AND it was ruining our dining experience. I also told John that we asked the hostess if we can sit somewhere else and she said the tables were taken. I politely pointed out that there was obviously several open tables available.  With no hesitation, John rescued us and moved us to another table.  My friend and I could now actually hear each other and feel comfortable eating our food.  Sam was also great who was our waiter, he checked on us often to see if we needed anything.    ::Highlight:: Thank you, John, for being awesome!!  We appreciate that you understood the situation and took care of us!!",

It is located DIRECTLY across from the Marquee Beach/Night Club inside the Cosmopolitan.   We went for lunch around 230 pm. There was no wait, yet there were tons of patrons. Before they came out, the server brought out a bucket of popcorn while we waited for our food. I ordered the Risining Sun $18 with sweet potato fries upgrade exta $2. My bf ordered El Machete, I believe $16.  Once the food came out it was like heaven on Earth! Such fresh, good qulaity meat and toppings were very delicious as well.  The bun was super fresh, THEY WERE LITERALLY MADE SAME DAY ( I asked). They definatly helped the burger score some points!  The rising sun had a sweeter taste to it, almost asian sweet. While El Machete had a little more spicer taste. Both were absolutly amazing.  We actually came back a couple other times during our stay in Vegas because it was just that good!  My bf tried the chocolate milkshake which runs about $9. He loved it. Possibly the best milkshake.  The service also scored a 5 star rating, everyone from the host that seats you to the server is well educated on the products and is courtous and well mannored, very prossessional.   If you are looking for phenomenal burger experience THIS IS IT. You will not find better, at least not in Vegas...and at this point im prepared to say or anywhere else!  Cant wait to go back!!",

So I had no clue what to expect from Holsteins, was it going to be amazing like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or disappointing like Burger Bar. However, I read in their description about how they are all organic and I had to give this place a try!  First off, the decor is really modern with colorful drawings of the astronaut cows. Very chic and modern, pretty much the standard at the Cosmo. Here were a couple of things we ordered:  Gold standard- 4/5- Really solid burger. The bacon blended perfectly with the sirloin patty.  Rising Sun- 4.5/5- This burger is an amazing combination of kobe beef with tempura avocado. Super tasty.  Smores milk shake- 4/5- This shake was amazing! However, it was dang expensive, $13 for a small shake! However, a little indulgence never hurts.  Overall, our hostess was super nice. However, they seemed to be understaffed and I had to yell out to them to get their attention. I would rank this place miles above burger bar but under Gordon Ramsay's.",

    "text": "First awesome thing about this place is realizing that you get free beer with check in. Second awesome thing about this place is that you get nacho cheese flavored popcorn to snack on before your meal. This is a big winner for two reasons: first, it's super cheap for the restaurant; second, it's delicious and satisfies the craving to snack, but doesn't fill you up. Third awesome thing about this place is literally everything on the menu.  Alcoholic milkshakes? Yes. Crazy flavors that actually work together and just in case you couldn't find enough things on the strip with alcohol in them, here are some more. Gourmet burgers? Yes. Fusion burgers of many kinds, as well as more traditional. Above average fries? Very much above average but not stellar.  I ordered the funky monkey milkshake, or whichever one has peanut butter, banana, and chocolate. I love banana, but I was feeling the peanut butter mood this night, so I compromised. You can hardly taste the alcohol though, because of the chocolate. Still delicious. I also ordered the bacon cheeseburger with arugula. Though basic, it was definitely a memorable burger. Thick bacon, good cheese, well-cooked patty, fresh arugula. 100%. My boyfriend ordered the bananas foster milkshake, which was good but the alcohol in that milkshake is too noticeable. He also ordered the kobe burger with fried avocado. It was an interesting combination of flavors, which were good, but I wouldn't ever order it and I'm glad I only had a taste.  I completely recommend this restaurant to anyone spending a few days on the strip. Great food, great service, great location.",

So I've been wanting to try Holstein's for a while and on my most recent trip to Vegas, we popped in for dinner.  Although I was eyeing the adult milkshakes, being lactose intolerant had me looking the other way.  I didn't want the test my luck that night, even with a purse full of Lactaid.  You only live once but I rather not spend it in a day of agony.  TMI?  Too bad.  This is my review so suck it, Trebek.    This gastropub is brightly lit and adorable with all the cow motifs.  The artwork is cute as heck and the food is amazing.  Upon being seated, they bring you free flavored popcorn.  I'm not a big popcorn person but it had me reaching for popcorn after popcorn!  I had me the Urth Burger [House Made Vegan Patty With Lettuce, Tomato, Cucumber, Sprouts & Avocado] and my dinner companion, the cutiepie Matt C., had the Nom Nom Burger [Kobe Beef, Cheddar Cheese, Potato Chips, 1000 Island Dressing].  Although I was hella craving for some vegetables, one bite of the Nom Nom Burger had me jealous.  It was juicy, cheesy, and so dang flavorful.  I also like the bite of the chips in the Nom Nom Burger.  As I passed Matt his burger back, I could only look down at my veggie burger with disappointment.  Dang it!  He got the fries and I got onion rings with our burgers and we shared them.  Both of these little munchies made for an excellent leftover midnight snack as well!  Don't forget to check-in to get a free 12oz. Holstein's house brew!  Matt C. beat me to the punch so we compromised and I drank majority of it.  It's good to be The Empress.",

We also got the bacon wrapped peppers, and some tacos (I forgot off the top of my head what it was exactly), but I remember it was really tender. Super yummy! They also had popcorn for us too.

Tip: Free Holsteins lager if you check in on Yelp!  Truffle Lobster Mac and Cheese ($16.50) - Small, yet filling portion of mac and cheese. The lobster bits were actually super meaty and generous.   The Fun-Ghi ($17) - Mushrooms and burger were both overcooked. My husband asked for medium rare and it was served medium. The accompanying French fries were missing an umph!

This appetizer is a shame for the chef and for the vegan costumers who would like to enjoy eating with there's non vegan friends at the same restaurant. I'm suggesting to the chef to take down from the menu the vegan bites and to learn how to make a good lentils or mung beans burger and then all the people can enjoy good vegan meal on the strip of las vegas.

It was pretty good (I had a bite) with fries. It's a great burger but it was $18.50 so not cheap. I got the steak & lobster quesadilla which was okay. I couldn't quite taste any lobster & it was 4 triangles so a smaller portion but luckily I don't eat that much so it was enough for me. I found it to be underwhelming & a bit too salty for $15.50. Overall the food was good but not exceptional for me & for the price. On a side note there is only 1 single bathroom for each gender which seemed weird although it was clean.

He got Eric R. the peppermint schnapps shake that was \"discontinued\" after Christmas but was able to get all of the ingredients to the bartender to make it happen.  I got the rising sun (apparently Ricco's fave burger) and it was deeeeelicious! It was beef with furikake, tempura avocado, yam strips, spicy mayo.  Everyone got their burgers made to order and they came out hot and fast.  I was impressed with the food but mostly with the service.  If you go, ask for Ricco's section!",

    "text": "Where do burgers like to dance? At a meat ball!  Where do I even begin with this place? From the atmosphere to the appetizer to the meals themselves, the experience was wonderful.   From the moment that we arrived at the restaurant, we were very impressed with the atmosphere that it gave off. Being that the majority of the Cosmopolitan is very dark and sleek looking, there was a bit of juxtaposition that takes place with having a place like Holstein's in there. The lighting inside of the restaurant gives off a very warm and inviting vibe, and there's all sorts of cool (cow-related) artwork filling the inside of the restaurant. It's very fun!  On a Friday night, we were seated immediately, which kind of surprised me, being that Holstein's is in a very popular hotel on the strip, and on a night where people are usually out and about. I probably helped that we got there before the clubbing crowd hit, though, so there's that. Either way, it was fast, and I like that! Then, as soon as we were seated, we were brought our complimentary popcorn appetizer, which, I must say, was quite the tasty start to our meal. I actually had to make an effort to not fill up on the popcorn too much before the we got our actual burgers.  Before we even got our burgers, though, I made sure to check in on Yelp! And boy am I glad that I did, because we were able to snag a free beer through a promotion that they have going on with Yelp, wherein you get a free beer with your first check-in to the restaurant. I didn't finish it because of how tasty and filling the burger and fries were, but it was really nice! I got a tiny bit of 'tude from the waiter when asking about the promotion, but I can look past that.  When we finally got our food (which didn't take very long at all), it looked so delicious that I had a hard time stopping to take some pictures of it to accompany my review. I ordered the Nom Nom burger, which consisted of Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, and thousand island dressing, and The Empress, miss Joyce W. ordered the Urth burger, a vegetarian burger consisting of a house made vegan patty with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and avocado.   As soon as I took a bite of my burger, I knew instantly that it was without a doubt the best burger I've ever had. I don't know if it was some sort of placebo effect caused by my knowing that the burger was made with Kobe beef, or that the burger was just plain delicious, but man was it good. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and the cheese was melted evenly all over the burger, and in a generous amount. There was also a generous amount of potato chips on the burger, which gave it such a nice crunch with every bite. I don't think that I had a bite of that burger that didn't have a bit of potato chip in it. The thousand island dressing on the burger was also delicious. The entire burger was just so good, right down to the bun. With just one bite, even The Empress could taste the deliciousness. Even her own vegetarian burger was delicious, which in itself is not something you'd expect to eat at a place like Holstein's where it's all about the beef.  Even the fries and onion rings that we shared were awesomely done. Both of the sides were nice and thick, and in, yet again, generous portions, which I can really appreciate. We couldn't even finish all of it because the burgers were so good and filling, and there was just so much in general.  Overall, Holstein's provided a 5/5 experience for us through and through. I only wish we'd had enough time to go back there to try more of their wonderful creations. I know there wasn't one burger on that menu that I didn't want to try.   If ever you find yourself in Vegas, I would say to make a point to try out Holstein's.",

I got the rising sun which was made medium Kobe beef with teriyaki sauce and tempura avocado and it was good but nothing made me wow!  I guess it's ok to stop by have a good cold beer and why not eat a Kobe burger! It's fast and convenient!  Oh and they bring popcorn with different flavors and this time it was the pizza flavor!

Next we shared lobster roll sliders - the hot dog buns were toasted, but left to cool and became dry - the lobster salad was finely chopped... I suspect claw meat... flavorless - I've had better lobster salad at a supermarket deli counter.  Finally the $17.50 burger (plus a $2 upcharge for onion rings.  The onions rings were described by our waiter as \"lightly battered and lightly fried\"... they were heavily breaded and overcooked.  The toppings on the burger were tasty, but the Kobe burger was smallish, dry and overcooked... Kobe should have a decent amount of fat due to marbling, but this one did not.  Bottom line - overpriced ($48 plus tip for the roll, burger and one glass of house wine) run-of-the-mill food and, although the service was good, we will not be back, nor will we recommend.",

This burger is actually listed on the menu as the \"Korean Bull-gogi burger\" and it consisted of a soy marinated burger topped with kimchi & a fried egg. Just a hint to my fellow Yelpers be sure to add Bacon to this burger because it really completes it. My only complaint about the burger was it was a little too juicy...and the juices were starting to flow from the meat onto my plate & hands but better juicy than dry. Theres also a quick fix to this by simply eating the burger upside down because for some reason the top bun is usually a lot more sturdy and  can manage to keep itself together.   In terms of cost this burger was about $5 then the dreaded one I had at Treasure Island and definitely worth the mark up.",

When I got my bill (everyone had separate checks), the coke was still on and when I brought it to the servers attention, she said she would take care of it. I was then brought my change with a coke in a to-go container and it still on the bill. In addition to auto-gratuity it was $30. So not worth it!

    "text": "When you are in the mood for a burger and want something with a creative spin, there are plenty of options in this town. This is certainly one of the top ten.  You'll love the environment here. It's got a trendy, unique array of decor, much like the rest of the Cosmo. Sort of a street art style.  The waiter will definitely pressure you to have alcohol, which is as you'd expect, a bit expensive here. We weren't in the mood for any drinks at the time and were feeling pretty cheap with our groupon in hand so we politely declined. He recommended their award winning Gold standard burger for myself, and their asian style burger for my girlfriend. I must say that they both came out heavenly.  Mine was a savory, sirloin steak patty served on blue cheese, arrugula and tomato. I substituted an egg in place of the bacon. Not particularly unique but what can I say-- it was love at first bite. The meat just melted off the burger with each bite, the arrugala complimented the rest of the flavors so well. I devoured every last bit, including the steak fries, which are noteworthy here. something about the way they cook their steak fries gives them this dark brown hue, much like the potato logs that you can get at the grocery deli. I absolutely love this style and much prefer it over the yellow, solid texture of the steak fries at Fatburger or Golden Steer.  Let me also say that my girlfriends meal was absolutely delightful as well. I ended up finishing the last 1/3 of her burger made with kobe beef and drizzled with a tasty sweet teriyaki glaze. Damn good but I prefer a similar one I had at Bachi. I still think that as far as asian style burgers go, you are better off making a trip to Bachi Burger, but for anything else you ought to give this place a try.   Perhaps I wouldn't have been so enthusiastic about the food if I had paid full price. This place is far from cheap and my groupon really helped lessen the burden on my wallet. Still, the burger was just so memorable that I could very well see myself coming back here when I'm in the cosmo again. And we haven't tried the shakes so I guess that alone is a good reason to come back. I thoroughly enjoyed this place and I am confident that you will too--give it a shot.",

It was our last supper of a 10 day showing family around Vegas trip.  Having pieced together the pieces of the dining experience I find that the memories come flooding back. We were seated rather late on a Saturday evening promptly and efficiently. The server (his name? Please, I can barely remember what I ate!) was good and guided us appropriately through the menu. We had Ahi Poke and Artichoke Guac (this I remember being very good!).  I ordered the Gold Standard Burger which was delicious, the tomato confit sweet and the goats cheese tart - perfect combo! Hubby had The Rising Sun which he said he wouldn't order again.  My 1 gripe is, for the most part our fault. We were looking forward to trying the \"Bam-Boozled Shakes\" however we found that dining late at night the shake preparer leaves for the evening. Unfortunately the shake preparer was also the dessert preparer, so no dessert or shakes for us. However this does provide the perfect excuse to return which we would be more than happy to do!",

    "text": "Interesting hipster burgers! I got the Rising Sun while Bryan got the Steakhouse Burger.  Rising Sun ($18.50): Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, tempura avocado  --Wow! Unique burger that confused our taste buds. One minute we think we're eating Japanese food, and then reminded again that it's a burger! Kobe beef was juicy and cooked perfectly. I liked the crunchy textures provided by crispy yam and tempura avocado. There was a mixture of flavors but not overwhelming: sweet (teriyaki), savory (mayo) and salty (furikake).  Steakhouse Burger ($18.50): black pepper beef patty, mixed greens, creamy steak sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, Swiss cheese  --This one was closer to a classic tasting burger. It was like eating steak in burger form. The patty was thick! Bryan added pickles ($1).  Popcorn (free) made for a fun appetizer that's different from the norm. The fries (comes with each burger) were amazing, super crispy! We were too full from our huge burgers to finish the fries, sadly. I'd recommend the Rising Sun as it's one of a kind!",

We also didn't get drink refills regularly (and our server seemed a little bothered to be bringing refills anyway).  One thing I didn't like is that they don't clear the glasses after the refill so our table was getting filled with glasses.   Our server also forgot to put in my mom's salad so she sat there without food for the entire time the rest of us were eating.   Instead of apologizing or explaining the server just hid in the corner.   When my mom got her salad, we could tell it was on the fly because the ahi on it was disgusting.   The only good thing about our service was that my dad forgot his discount card and it was honored anyway.   But I get the feeling this happened because of the whole salad thing.     I can't say I won't be back because the food isn't terrible but I don't think I'll be back any time soon.",

The burgers would be so much better with different buns, like H&F. The parmesan garlic fries were kind of gross. They were smothered in green garlic paste.

He was great, the hamburger was good as was the chicken Caesar salad, and the milkshakes were great. But then this time asking the manager Ivan to put on a different game was beyond weird. He acted like he forgot what job he done had and thought I worked for him for a second. Obviously the service industry ain't the job for him if can't act right and professional to say the least. The food then took forever and wasn't as good as the 1st time, so with that on top of everything else we made it our last time going here. And last but not least, the supposed owner Ana Santos contacted me on here asking me to reach out, which I did via email and she has yet to respond a month later. All starts at the top.",

I don't even want to know the calorie count on that milkshake!  The burgers are very fancy (lol).  I had the rising sun! The fried avocado was delish and the crispy yam gave this burger a nice crunchy texture.  My burger was unevenly cooked tho. Some parts were over cooked and some where too undercooked.   But what really pushed my buttons was the French fries. It was generic. Nothing special about it. Frozen, store bought fries.  One would expect for the fries to be hand cut at least.  For the price of burgers and fries...it should have been.   The reason I'm giving three stars and not less is bc of our server. He was nice and attentive. Refilled my hubby's drink at least five times even tho he also had a large party.  Also I liked the handcrafted milkshakes.  Will I be back? Probably not. Too many places to eat in Vegas!",

I like their happy hour--it's reasonable prices for beer! As for food, I'm not too dazzled by it. The lobster mac & cheese didn't have enough flavoring. The salad wasn't bad--but the tuna was alright. It didn't amaze me. Just a regular salad really. As for the Surf 'N Turf quesadilla.. It was.. interesting.. I'm not sure I like it. It had lobster and grilled steak in it and I guess I figured out that I don't really like that combo--wasn't for me. And it was such a small portion so I was very surprised. I also didn't really like the fact that there wasn't much cheese inside the quesadilla so I guess that's also why I didn't like it too much.  I feel like I should have went with a burger here knowing that that is their specialty. So if you're reading this and debating if you just want something else--no. Get a burger! It's probably so much more amazing than what I had ordered!",

    "text": "Holstein's would not have been my first choice, but I was not the decision-maker for this meal. I did not have high expectations, so I can't say I was disappointed, but I was underwhelmed. I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries. It was okay, not the best and not the worst. The fries were more like something you would get at a fast food restaurant. I'd eat it again, but I wouldn't choose it over something like Secret Pizza.  The service was friendly and attentive. Our server seemed stressed out, but he was kind.   The bar and lounge area are extremely loud. There is no way you could have a conversation. The restaurant is quieter, but it's still hard to hear at times.   The Strip pricing is the killer here. You should not have to pay this much for a burger and fries. I wouldn't come back specifically for that reason.",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended so we had to give it a shot while in Vegas for a convention. We had about a 10 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon so not bad. The decor is fun and whimsical and has one theme...cows, cows and more cows.  They are known for their shakes and burgers so we didn't dare stray from the headliners. But before the main event, complimentary popcorn is served. It's covered in pizza seasoning which is not a combination I could appreciate. Maybe it would have been more appealing if the popcorn was served hot/fresh. Maybe not.  I ordered the Gold Standard burger and hubby had the Classic cheeseburger; $18.50 & $16.50 respectively. All burgers come with fries. Our fries came out barely lukewarm. We sent them back and the second batch was much better. You can sub onion rings or sweet potato fries for a couple of bucks extra. The shakes with booze are $15 and $9 for regular ones. Both the burgers and shakes are very good but neither the best I've had. Still a memorable experience.  Topped off with nitro meringues. A special treat for those celebrating a birthday or who just ask nicely; and are not afraid to touch and eat something made with liquid nitrogen.",

    "text": "Burgers and boozy shakes? I'm totally there.  We stopped in for lunch after reading the rave reviews -- the burgers intrigued the boyfriend, and I was sold on the boozy shakes. There is cute cow decor everywhere, which makes you feel almost a little bit guilty about devouring its friend in burger form.  We sat down at a table by the bar and ordered the Rising Sun burger, poutine with a fried egg, and a Campfire S'mores shake, bam-boozled of course. The Rising Sun is SO on point -- perfectly cooked kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Is there anything more that you need for a burger? The perfect side of fries? Yes, that's there, too. The poutine was also jam-packed with flavor, but it got to be a bit too salty by the end.  That boozy shake though? The BEST. The magic inside the Campfire S'mores shake includes marshmallow vodka, graham cracker, chocolate sauce, toasted marshmallow, s'mores candy stick, s'mores chocolate balls, chocolate covered graham crackers, vanilla frosting, graham crumble. Oh yes. ALL of that. If there was any time that you wanted to treat yo'self to something sweet, this would be the time to do it. There's just enough alcohol to taste it in the background, but the sugar overload will have you wired regardless. All of their shakes are massive so I definitely recommend grabbing a friend or two to share.",

They start off with giving flavored popcorn at the table, which is nice when you're drooling while looking over the menu. After going over the menu, it was a pretty quick choice. We knew we had to try a burger, parmesan garlic fries, and a shake.  First off, the fries are amazing. There was a good amount of garlic and parmesan on them, they didn't skimp out! There was also more than enough for 3 of us so the portion was pretty big. Now the burgers...yum. They were delicious. So tasty and juicy. The flavors all really popped and make it great. This place is also known for their shakes. They are AMAZING. The shakes have alcohol and all kinds of goodies in them. We had the Donutella which had a donut placed of top of the shake with frosting all over the outside of the cup. It was something else. You have to go try this place!",

I was contacted by the manager, Ryan, who had reached out to me last week to arrange a day to call me to discuss the details of my review. Holsteins cares about feedback and will use it as a tool for improvement; I have no doubt.   Will I be back to Holsteins, most likely, yes. This was an impromptu trip to Las Vegas for a 2-night stay. We chose Holsteins for the burgers, narrowing our choices down based heavily on Yelp reviews. I have no doubt that our next visit will see marked improvements.   This interaction has also made me consider my input as a Yelper. Reviews can be a much-needed tool for businesses to know where they need improvement. My business relies on feedback, and it is always appreciated. It's important to know that some businesses really do value feedback and reviews as tools to improve. Be fair and honest in your writing.   Kudos, Ryan for letting me know that you care about your business. Thanks for taking the time to really hear me. It means a lot!",

    "text": "Stayed in this hotel all week. My last night I decided to stay in instead of venture out. While looking for an easy dinner option I noticed this place had some vegan options. Sadly once I got downstairs to the restaurant, I was made to feel as an inconvenience for asking questions and making special requests. Their \"veggie\" burger which is advertised as vegan has a mayo aioli on it. They also have a vegan alcoholic shake which quite frankly sounds distinguishing to me due to all the ingredients however some may like it. I asked for just a basic vegan shake with added peanut butter and was told there would be an upcharge which ended up being $12. The guy who took my order then proceeded to talk to the staff around him about me- yea I get it, I have a dietary need, but who cares, shouldnt matter to you . I'm spending over $20 on a burger that likely costs them 2-4$ and veganism is not NEW... well you learn your lessons fast this way and hopefully others avoid this place despite their small attempt to, if I can even say \"accommodate\"? Everyone? I surely didn't feel accommodated or even welcomed. When someone is apologetic for asking questions and not trying to be difficult- it's probably not a wise idea to agree and say \"yea I see that your difficult ...\"",

I loved the aged goat cheddar cheese and arugula compared to the typical American or cheddar cheese and iceberg lettuce. The flavors of all the ingredients with the garlic aioli was delicious!  The onion rings were coated in Panko crumbs and fried crispy and perfect.   H had the Nom Nom burger because it was a simple cheeseburger with potato chips and 1000 island dressing. Like an In-n-Out burger with chips inside. LOL! I must say, this was a pretty yummy burger because of the simplicity of the flavors.   Little O had the Kid's Sliders with French fries. She got two cute little sliders.   For dessert we had to try one of their Bam-Boozled shakes... a virgin\" shake, of course!  The girls chose the Frozen Grasshopper shake and it was SO  delish! The mint ice cream was well made--not too sweet and not too minty. They have a good thing going here! The mint chips on the outside of the shake glass was a great touch.   We came between the lunch and dinner rushes so service was great and we were served immediately. Our server was very attentive and helped answer a lot of our questions.",

    "text": "tl;dr Bad food, ok service (but still doesn't make up for bad food but earns an extra star).    A group of us wanted to get eggslut but the line was extremely long. And since we were hungry, we opted for Holsteins instead (not my decision). They sat us down right away and we ordered our food promptly. However, it took over an hour to receive our food. Our server (Asian guy) apologized for the delay but it was frustrating to see other parties who came after us get their food and nearly finish it before we saw a single order of our own.   Wish my hunger made up for the lack of taste. Granted, I ordered the Thai steak salad at a burger joint but I at least expected the steak to be decent. It was unbearable to eat. It was very tough and there was no end to my chewing and I just had to take out all the steak and eat the salad. I had told the server about it and the kitchen just charged me for a regular salad instead. I mean, just take the damn thing off the bill instead of half-assing it! If I just wanted a salad without the steak, I would have ordered it. Really irritating when they don't stand by their food and service.   No one else seemed too thrilled about their burgers either. My friend who had food poisoning prior to this Vegas trip had her first real meal here and even she was not loving her funghi burger. Another friend described her patty like \"biting into a mattress.\" Whatever that means, it does not sound appetizing.   Really regretted not having eggslut and wasting a meal here. Will most certainly not be returning.",

Hubby and I split the nom nom burger. Kobe burger with potato chips and 1000 island. It was very tasty.  Started with the curds. Good but you can pass and eat your fries that came with your burger and not feel like you missed out on something.  Treated myself to the Avery white beer, a nice solid beer. I'm between a shock top and blue moon.  The kids think we are awesome because we let them eat more junk then the usual.  Worth a visit.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better burger experiences I've had, especially in Vegas, not to mention the shakes are incredible (and huge).  I've been here probably 4-5 times over the past 5 years and have always had a great experience. It's not as upscale as other restaurants on the strip, and therefore makes for a good option if you want some casual, \"lower cost\" dining. The food is always good, plentiful, and is served quickly.  While I imagine the restaurant isn't designed to be fancy, I wish it were just a tad bit more upscale to match what you'd expect out of the Cosmo as a whole. Other than that, this place is a staple for me when I travel to Vegas.",

I had the Fatty Patty burger (without the thousand island). It was a basic burger but with so much flavor, with the Hawaiian bun. For my cocktail, I had the 'Aces Full', which consisted of Ace Rose Berry Cider, New Amsterdam Gin, St. Germain, Blueberry Syrup, & Lime Juice. It almost reminded me of a sangria but was a lot better & tastier. Unfortunately for me, since I was too full off appetizers & dinner, I couldn't make any room for a bam-boozled shake :/ But I know to save some room for next time! I definitely will be going back.",

    "text": "Summary: great service, great ambience, great burger, and one of the best shakes ever.  Ya gotta go.  I had a little bit of time to squeeze in lunch before my return flight, and decided to come based on the Yelp reviews, photos of the food, and the claim of \"best burger in Vegas\"  Strong words.    Ambience:  The Cosmo (where Holsteins is located) is a trendy, modern, upscale feel.  Holsteins is a cool mix of that + casual.  You can come in Cosmo clothes, or just a polo shirt/jeans and you won't feel out of place.    Service:  Sat at the bar, served by Bridgot, who seemed to have more than a passing familiarity with a few patrons.  Good sign.  The servers assisting were all friendly, prompt, and willing to help.  Food:  They've won awards for the Prime Time and Billionaire Burger, but neither of those felt good that day.  So I got the Gold Standard because the combo of bacon, goat cheese, arugula, and the garlic/chive aioli sounded like just the ticket.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare, the patty was the right thickness, the bread was soft, and the toppings worked very well together, even if a touch salty overall.    Fries:  Nothing fancy in the way of thick cut, seasoned, or fancy sauces.  Just a really solid set of basic fries - pretty hard not to finish these.  Shakes:  I wanted four shakes:  the Cookies & Cream, Donutella, Drunken Monkey, and the Fat Boy.  The Cookies and Cream won out because it came with a (full size!) cookie sammich.    (Exhibit voice) \"Yo dawg, I heard you like cookies and ice cream. So I put cookies and ice cream on top of your cookies and ice cream so you can cookie and ice cream while you cookie and ice cream.\"  This shake was as good as my imagination thought it would be.  If it wouldn't have required a second stomach and possible ambulance, I would have gotten the other three shakes.   The ice cream sandwich was perfect. A fresh baked cookie can be too soft. A premade cookie usually tastes cheap and is too hard. This one was just right. Tastes fresh, stayed together, and went great with the ice cream,which was just the right amount of sweetness.   I slept pretty well on the plane ride home.  This place will be a staple when I come to Vegas...like most places there, it isn't cheap, but unlike most places, you won't be thinking about the money when you leave.  Gordon Ramsey's burger joint can take a few tips from these guys. I agree, best burger/shake I've had in Vegas so far.",

Med well was the best they could do. My arugula was not fresh so I scraped it off. Better, but hard to eat. I will say the bread has integrity. It held together. It was the best part of the burger. My fries were undercooked. Limp and greasy.  Server was quick with water and coffee refills. The boozy shake was good. I'd have another shake but I wouldn't do another burger. Burger Bar at Mandalay is FAR superior if you're after a good ~$20 burger.",

    "text": "Holsteins Shake and Buns is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  They have a bar area and a regular restaurant area.  I stopped by and ordered their Nom Nom burger and a Cookies and Cream shake.  Complimentary popcorn is provided to all patrons.  Nom Nom Burger ($20) - This consisted of a Kobe beef patty, cheddar cheese, thousand island dressing, and some potato chips, sandwiched between a potato bun.   It also came with a side of fries, which I upgraded to sweet potato fries for $2.50 more.  While the burger was cooked a perfect medium rare per my request,  I was disappointed in the size and considering how much I spent on it, it definitely didn't warrant the price.   Yes, the burger was juicy, but I would have been perfectly happy with a burger at most of my favorite places for about 1/3 of the price.  The sweet potato fries were disappointing and soggy.  Cookies and Cream Shake ($12) - This came with oreo & chocolate chip cookies, a huge chocolate chip ice cream sandwich, dark & white chocolate crunchies, vanilla frosting, and oreo crumbs.  And if that wasn't enough, an extra steel cup was provided with more of the shake.  This shake is designed for at least 2 or 3 people, I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this.  It was way too much for me, I couldn't finish this.  It was rich, creamy and delicious!  Overall, the burgers here are a major let down and aren't worth the price.  The shakes on the other hand are the real star of the place.   While the menu lists pricing for the shakes with alcohol, all shakes are available without alcohol and are priced for $3 cheaper ($9 ~ $12).",

You can really taste all of the major ingredients in it. If you like the taste of tempura and teriyaki this is the burger for you!  CHEERS!!  It's 11/21/17.  Just had to come back.  This time I had the Forager. If you love the mushrooms you have to get this. I'll keep this short and just give it 5 thumbs up!!!!    I forgot to mention how AWSOME the service is.

    "text": "Stayed in Vegas for four days and dined here three times.   Service was wonderful and on point two out of the three times. On the other visit the server wasn't attentive and didn't check on us until we were finished.   The food was excellent during the three visits. On the first visit I had the turkey burger it came with sprouts, tomato, onion, lettuce topped with pepper jack cheese. I stole a few of the hub's wedge cut fries and they were great with a good seasoning and not greasy. On the second visit I tried the house salad topped with salmon. It came with avocado, tomato and mixed greens with balsamic dressing. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the portion was just the right size. On the last visit I tried the vegan burger. It was a house made patty with veggies and had a crispy breaded outside. It came with lettuce, onion, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best vegan burgers I have had. I don't know how they do it but the patty was juicy and was tasty.   The drunken monkey adult shake is out of this world! A combo of banana, peanut butter cups, ice cream and liquor. It is a bit pricy for $11. bucks but they do fill a shake glass and give the metal cup with the extra shake. If you get a shake don't order a lot of food since this shake is almost a meal by itself or make sure to share.   Price is average for a restaurant in Vegas $14-$18.00. Food is delish, ingredients are fresh, portions are large and for the most part service is good.   I hope they open a location in the bay area . On my next trip to Vegas I will be sure to make a fourth visit.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place out after work & what a lively, happening atmosphere I walked into. You can easily access this restaurant, which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel by entering in their garage parking & find a spot in the East side area. Once you get in the elevator, hit the button #2 that says Wicked Spoon and Convention Center. When you come out, walk to your right & in seconds you'll be hearing some jammin' music & see an array of colorful artwork all over this place.  I checked in with the hostess & was told to walk in the middle of the room, where another hostess was waiting to escorted me to my table. Quick & prompt just the way I like it ;) I sat in front of two nice sized flat screen tvs to watch the sports channel. It was literally a money spot. Front row view & nobody to block lil' ol' me. I like this spot.. oh yes I do.  My server, Jonathan acknowledged my presence & was greeted ever so swiftly as he finished with an order from another party. Giving me his undivided attention, he did the squat to talk to me, which I felt was a better way in interacting and actually connecting with a guest. A more personable approach I would say... I asked him if there was any way I could take my food to go, since I explained that I would like to share it with my Family and he was more than willing to oblige my request.   He went over the menu with me & gave me the highlights on each item I was interested in trying. I appreciate his honesty on how I should get my Salmon cooked and what I could possibly add if I would like it to be more juicy & flavor in the Turkey choice that I ordered. Jonathan was very helpful and didn't mind taking the time to let me know what he thought would enhance my dining experience. Kudos to that & without even giving me my food yet & I gave him his well deserved tip. I think he even bowed & said thank you so much. Wait.. I think I bowed to him first?!?? Eh it's in my culture to bow when I appreciate & respect someone. Koreans have a certain hand gesture when giving someone a card, dish, drink, anything exchanging from one another. Don't mind me.. I'm just being ME.  Tom Turkey Sliders ( comes in 3's ) from the Tiny Buns Section - When you first glance at these trios... Adorably cute. It consists of sprouts, cucumber slaw, & Russian dressing on the side. The dressing itself is between a hint of Horseradish & Thousand Island Dressing. It gives off a tangy bite at first, then instantly mellows out like cream. The tiny buns oddly enough had the texture of taffy.. a bit on the dry side, But I ended up liking the chewy bites. I generously dipped my slider in the dressing & although it wasn't all grand slam.. I was pleasantly happy with the meat portion, which was thick & juicy.   Crispy Pork Belly Bun - ( comes in 3's ) Think of Peking Duck Steamed Bun & instead of chives, its thinly sliced cucumber & pea shoots. I swear there was cilantro in the mix too. The hoisin sauce is more like a Chinese barbeque-like sauce that has somewhat a balanced mix of tangy, salty, and sweetness some fruity undertones. The steamed buns were fluffy and so soft. The pork belly was nicely cooked to perfection in such a way, being so tender, yet crisp on the outer portions of the meat. A combination that anybody would love.  Captain Hook - I ordered the grilled Atlantic Salmon medium as my server recommended and it looked ravishing. I would say this is a good looking burger. Succulent and vibrant. Marvelous in taste combining the house cured gravlax aka thinly sliced raw salmon atop with the grilled salmon. Together with pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo, and frissee leaves.. This was definitely a Hit for me, especially if you like textured meats. I chose the shoestring instead of steakcut fries that comes with this meal. Thin, crispy, and tasty! I have to note.. the meat was unbelievably moist and juicy. I'm Hook'ed!  My Family and I enjoyed all the burgers. The music at Holstein's is fresh. Even made me want to workout in my mouth and tapped Both of my feet to the beats. Friendly staff and wonderful service. I would recommend Jonathan again to be my server. I did observe his interaction with his guests while waiting for my food to go. He was exceptionally polite and attentive to every table he had. I even heard compliments to him from another table next to me. I did skip on the shakes this time, but the Oreo is my favorite! The artwork here is uniquely admirable. I like the way they hold this place down with colors that will tickle your sweet tooth. Great location for people watching and even mingling :P",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that my husband disagrees with me, but, I'm just not that into Holsteins. Sorry.  Went here Tuesday late July, seated right away, polite and helpful waitress. Ordered mexican car bomb appetizer. Those were blow your face off hot. Light on the cheese, apparently unseeded jalapenos.   Husband had the steakhouse,  that was okay. I had the gold standard, it was meehh. Daughter had the classic,  it was mediocre.  Baby girl had kids sliders,  no cheese because she's nine years old, wtf?   The saving grace for Holsteins is the shakes, baby girl and I share the strawberry,  magnificent!  Chocolate shake was also exquisite.   The problem, one app, two shakes, three burgers, kids sliders,  $123, $150 with tip. Can't do it, sorry. For burgers, I'd rather have In N Out (but their shakes are nasty).",

    "text": "While most normal people would order a burger at Holsteins I went with a black & white shake, artichoke hummus and sweet potato fries. Perhaps a strange combination, but don't judge me...I'm pregnant. In this rare instance my eyes turned out to be bigger than my growing stomach because I put a pretty good dent in the fries, drank about half the shake, but didn't have much room for the hummus. Although to be honest the hummus was pretty nasty. However, the fries and shake totally hit the spot.  Holsteins was absolutely packed late night on a Friday, but we were able to enjoy the full menu from the lounge area. My husband raved about his Korean Bull Gogi and cocktail, which I may be up for trying myself the next time I\"m there and not eating for two.",

    "text": "We wanted a really good burger so we researched and decided on Holstein's. We ordered a Gold Standard with onion rings to split. It was very good and satisfied our burger craving. I also like how they ask you how you want your burger cooked and actually cook it that way. So many times I order a medium burger only to be brought out a well done one. Holstein's didn't disappoint! Onion rings were good; I think they have too much breading, but at least they were really crispy. Get a side of Chipotle Ranch for you rings or fries - it's really good. We didn't order a shake but we saw them - they were huge! You basically get two shakes.",

I do remember this place though, so thats a plus considering most things in vegas are a blur. we stopped in here after sleeping all day and taking one look at burgr and walking away immediately.  me and a friend both got the gold standard burger and I also got a drunken monkey shake. I loved the shake. Personally I thought the burger was just normal, maybe even a tiny bit dry.   This was more a fun atmosphere kind of place. Sitting at the bar waiting for the food, we were surrounded by really friendly people, and cougars. Bartender was really cool too so overally it was a good experience.  A bit pricey but its vegas.",

    "text": "Both delicious and affordable! Its about $16-20 a plate (all the burgers come with fries as well).   I got the Crazy Bird (I think that's what it was called) which was the chicken burger. It had candied shallots, garlic aioli, cheese, lettuce and kettle chips. I ended up scraping the candied shallots off because I didn't like them much but everything else was spot on!   My favorite part, however, was the French fries. Absolutely delicious. They didn't taste like fake packaged potatoes you get at a lot of other places and the serving size was good!   The service was good, I don't know our waitress' name but she was fast and attentive.   Cons:   The food took quite long to come out. But I will also mention that it was Saturday night, it didn't seem too busy to me but hey this could've been why. This was the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars.   The shakes are overpriced. $9 for a basic shake.   The popcorn they gave didn't really have a taste, but hey it was free so can't really complain there.   Overall, good experience here. I would recommend this place when you don't want a big buffet but want a good meal. You'll leave here full for less than $20 if you don't add on any extras!",

    "text": "Anyone who knows me, knows how much I'm a sucker for burgers. Ever since I moved to Vegas I've been on the hunt for a great burger joint. Holsteins comes very close to hitting the mark. I've tried about 4 different burgers from here (Rising Sun, Gold Standard) but I must say the Nomnom Burger & Billionaire Burger were my favorite. So tender and tasty. Now that's a burger! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. So the fries, meh. I could do without those. Funny, it seems difficult to find a place that has great burgers AND fries. I mean come on, you can't really enjoy one without the other. Am I right? Before my visit, I scrolled through some pictures on yelp I noticed the thick cut fries. Mama like! Imagine my disappointment to hear they no longer have those on the menu, boo! Anywho, the onion rings are good and the shakes are pretty standard. Order a bamboozled shake if you need a little \"pick me up\" Hey, it's happy hour somewhere. :) The service has always been great, even with larger parties. So bring your friends, appetite and don't forget your wallet! These burgers are not for the frugal foodie.",

    "text": "Super close to a 5 for me, but just a few things knocked it down to a 4.5.  Food: Definitely had a great time eating some CRAZY good food :] - Popcorn: Omg our group devoured these. Salt and Vinegar Popcorn was amazing. Thank God the first tin was free. - BamBOOZEled Shakes: Shakes with Booze in them :]. I don't remember the names of them, but I really enjoyed the one with the Cereal in it. Sweet, Creamy, and still had the alcohol taste to it. - BURGERS, OMG SUPER GOOD. My friends NOMed on the El Machete (they suggest you add an Egg in it too!). It has a good kick to it. I had the Rising Sun, and the Avocado Tempura was the part that simply made it spectacular. Shredded Fried Yam and Teriyaki Sauce were a great touch to make it look super lovely. - Fries: NOOOOO This was a major downfall. Were pretty bland and tasteless. Wish they had more seasoning or something to it!  Service: Our table liked our waitress. One guy at our table was pretty much \"Well she's for sure getting a 20% tip at least\". She was super friendly, threw in some cool jokes, got us some more free popcorn, helped us take a picture, and all with a genuine smile. Definitely the made the night a whole lot better. She was a bit busy, but she came by exactly when we needed it.  Atmosphere: This place has a strange, but great mix of cuteness and casualness. The cartoonish artwork creates a light and whimsical setting, but the lighting and decor definitely bump this place towards a lounge sort of feel. Our group enjoyed it and it fit perfectly into the Vegas atmosphere.  Price: I'm not complaining to be honest, since I feel like I got what I paid for. Though numerically I spent around $30-$40 (For a shake, and burger) it seemed well worth it to me.  Overall Opinion: There were a few things that just dropped this place from a 5. Lack of solid fries, a tinnnnnny bit pricey on the shakes, and just that ounce of \"THIS THING IS SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD TRY\" was missing. However despite that, this place clearly has a great variety on their menu, solid use of organic and high grade ingredients, and a unique atmosphere for the hip and casual crowds. I'm excited to come back here to try another Shake and Burger!",

First of all, the service was the WORST I have ever seen. Our waitress disappeared and never refilled our drinks, and the appetizer took literally 30 mins to come out and once it came out, of course our meal came about 1.5 mins afterwards. She didn't even apologize for the delay or for the food coming out at the same time. She literally just walked away and never came back to our table. Then I had a turkey burger-it was actually almost inedible because it was so incredibly dry. Eh, just not good and wish we had gone somewhere else instead.",

Lots of customization options for the PERFECT burger. If you order a burger, you have to get one of their shakes. These shakes are PHENOMENAL. They are served both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and are the perfect match to a great burger. I had the red velvet cake shake, with an extra shot, its Vegas after-all and I LOVED it!

    "text": "Holsteins was bustling with activity when I went on a recent Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant was brightly lit and loud.  There was a game on the televisions in the bar, and as a result, the bar was packed.  After waiting ten minutes for a table, we were seated at a comfortable table.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  She acknowledged us promptly and took our drink orders.  She provided several suggestions, and when I asked about the Nom Nom burger, she informed me that it was done as a charity promotion but was so popular, they kept it on the menu.    After serving us drinks, she provided us with a small bucket of popcorn.  Cute. And tasty.  I am sort of a popcorn kind of guy.  You probably didn't know that about me, and probably didn't want to know that about me. There are more things I can share, but I won't.  The popcorn was fresh and warm.  It also had a distinct flavor that was hard to place.  I thought it could have been a pickle flavor seasoning.  Hey, I am at a burger place, right?  It was salt and vinegar.  Tasty.  The burgers came out quickly, and cooked to specification.  I asked for a little bit of pink, and that is what I got.  I had the Nom Nom burger.  It was tasty.  It could have been better.  The menu billed it as Kobe Beef.  At $16.50 for an 8 ounce burger, I can assure you this is not authentic Kobe Beef.  The first Kobe Beef in the last two years in Vegas is at City Center.  They are charging $35 an ounce.  So, maybe they are billing the Wagyu as Kobe Beef.  Or maybe it is the Kobe style beef.  Who knows.  I just know it wasn't what was billed.    We skipped the booze because we were trying to eat on the cheap.  A diet Coke, an iced tea, and two sandwiches came out to $42.  A little pricey in my opinion.  But, considering where I am, I don't mind paying for it.  The burger, as I mentioned was cooked perfectly.  The bun was firm, but a little on the plain and boring side.  The fries, I got the shoe string, my companion got the thick fries, were hot, salted and well seasoned.  I preferred the shoe string fries over the thick fries.  So did my friend.  The burger was topped with white cheddar, potato chips and Thousand Island.  There was barely any sauce.  The chips covered the perfectly melted cheese.  I was surprised that there was no additional garnish present.  No pickle, tomato, onion or lettuce on the plate.  Not even a sprig of parsley.  At these prices, surely they could toss something in.  Applebee's even garnishes their plates with a sprig of inedible, icky kale.  I didn't get a chance to sample the liquor malts, but rest assured, next time I go, I won't be driving, so I will definitely take a taste.",

    "text": "We ate here on a Tuesday evening at about 9pm, it wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately.  We had the pork belly sliders and the Longhorn Burger with shoestring fries.  We also shared a Grasshopper milkshake.    The sliders were the best part of the meal, great flavor and I could have eaten 5 of these :-) They were $9 for two.    The Longhorn Burger had brisket, BBQ sauce, coleslaw and a pickcle on it.  We held the coleslaw and the pickle, but had to pay $2 (on top of the $16 for the burger) for a slice of cheddar.  The burger was slightly overcooked, the BBQ sauce was hardly there and I couldn't find any brisket on my half of the burger.  The Grasshopper shake was $11 and tasted of mint and chocolate, but there was no alcohol - I guess I expected to taste it at $11.  I would not go back to this restaurant - there are better places in Vegas and even back home in Albuquerque.",

I asked for well done and they have me well done - something I appreciate because most places tend to still give you medium well even when you ask for well. My bf had the turkey burger (forgot the name?) I thought the flavors were very good but the turkey meat was a little dry and it felt heavy & dense. He didn't like it. I would give it another try though because the flavors were right on. French fries were a perfect pairing. The prices were reasonable especially considering the location. Service could be better more attentive (ex: cups not being refilled) but our waiter was still courteous, polite, and sufficient. I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "#vakseen4taste At this point Holsteins has become one of those spots we hit anytime we're in Vegas. They have a great beer, cocktail and food selection. Last night we started with the truffled lobster mac n cheese. I've actually been dying to try this dish and it was pretty good. Not great, but good. I'd say it was more the seasoning (or lack of) and flavor of the actual cheese sauce used that could've been better. I expected something a little more rich and creamy. The best thing about this dish is that they didn't go light on the lobster. You had chunks in almost every bite. From there I had the Captain hook (Grilled atlantic salmon w/ frissee, pickled shallots, herb-caper mayo & house cured gravlax) which was excellent. I ordered the salmon medium and it came out a little closer to medium welll, yet it was still flaky and amazing. The combination of flavors in this sandwich are crazy! The house cured gravlax...WOW. Service was pretty quick considering the Final 4 was on and the place was packed. I'd actually recommend making reservations before coming because this place is always packed. Before I forget, our server was very friendly and barely clothed lol. I mean literally her ass was hanging out of her shorts, a LA Hooters. No complaints on my end, but the ladies found it pretty entertaining lol. Just a tip if you bring the jealous type. All in all, a great experience as expected. Food 8.5/10. Service 8/10. Atmosphere 8/10",

    "text": "WARNING: This place sucks I got really bad food poisoning from eating a Lamb Burger there. I have eaten there 3 times and never really liked it but after getting food poisoning NEVER AGAIN!  First off even if I had not gotten sick...  The place is over priced, the keep the dining room too cold, and the frys suck. The only good thing about the place is the location. And it does not live up to he hype.  The have warnings and  a * by every burger to tell you that you can get sick from undercooked food. This would not be necessary if their food was fresh. One warning is enough, but regardless you don't serve people bad food or old food that's going bad. You do not eat at your own risk! That's not how Restaurants work!  I first went to the place after hearing it was good and saw it on Groupon and bought 3 groupons. I went with a friend. Had a burger and fries and was not impressed there are much better burgers in this city like Bachi Burger, Smash Burger, Cheese Cake Factory, Etc...  The other 2 Groupons expired, that's how little I thought of the place! I went  one other time for someone's birthday and I did not have much of a choice. The food was still average as best.  The last time I went I only  went because I had Groupon credits. I ordered a Lamb Burger and the waiter said it tasted like a Gyro. The place was so cold I could hardly eat. The lady in the booth next to me over heard me complaining about how cold it was and she said \"You're not crazy, it too cold in here and my husband sent is fries back because they were cold.\"  The Lamb burger was over spiced to hide the flavor of the obviously old lamb that was going bad. (Note: I'll never order a Lamb Burger anywhere again as Lamb does not sell as fast and they probably kept it too long.)  The Taziki sauce on the burger was horrible and the worst Taziki I have ever had. The fries, I just don't like they are just not good, not crisp and I don't like what ever they dip them in.  First I will say that I eat Sushi, Medium Lamp Chops, Ahi Tuna Burgers med-rare and Burger Med all of the time and I've Never had a problem.  Also for those of you that don't know Taking 1 Tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of water can prevent many types of food borne illnesses as as well just normal digestive issues.  I did that after eating there as a precaution since their warnings all over the menu and their greasy fries.  I started feeling achy within an hour and got tired. When I got home took a nap. Woke up feeling nauseated. Took more Vinagar with a few drops of Lugol's Iodine this time. That will kill almost anything and will keep you safe  in 3rd world countries. Because of these steps I have not had food poisoning in many years.  Was not helping. I ended up vomiting for 45 minutes getting the runs, and knew it was time to get out the Activated Charcoal. In hindsight I would have gone with a large does of this first.  Even after all of these steps and a few more I took to kill off the pathogens in the food I ate there. I was sick in bed with fever for the next 2 days and my 3 day easter weekend was ruined. On the bright side do to knowing how to handle it I didn't die, didn't have kidney failure and I'm smarter than to ever eat at that place again!  Eat there at your own risk and if you do make sure it's WELL DONE!  A Few Tips to Prevent/ Cure Food Poisoning that could save your life: Because this was one of the most miserable experiences I have had from eating out... I want to share some tips that will prevent this for others.  Don't Order Foods that are not top sellers.  Drinking Hard Alcohol with food can also reduce the bacteria on food but it's not always the best choice. I personally don't like to drink. But if you have no other option A shot of Vodka could help.  Apple Cider Vinegar in water after eating can prevent many types of food poisoning if they are bacteria and not already forming toxins for those type even heat will not kill the toxins.  Lugol's Iodine added to the mixture makes it even more effective against bacteria and viruses.  Colloidal Silver taken after eating can also help to kill food borne bacteria.  But the #1 thing that will soak up the bacteria, the toxins they produce as well as actual poison and even heavy metals, stop the vomiting and runs to the bathroom is Activated Charcoal and a fairly large does of it like 1-2 table spoons in a big glass of water.   Google it and do your research and keep some with you when you travel and in your home.  My mistake was not taking the Activated Charcoal sooner and a large enough does... Oh wait my first mistake was eating there.",

We shared the Caesar salad ($12), which the server split into two plates for us, and the Gold Standard burger with steak fries ($17.50), which we split ourselves with the extra plate.

From what I can remember we've tried the chopped salad from the GRAZE menu, meat ball, beef, and there was once some sort of steak and arugula grinders that were highly priced but more than worth it on the TINY BUNS menu, California turkey from the BIG BUNS menu, every type of fries they offer, and a few other things I can't remember... Everything is always shockingly good and our drinks are always stiff. Much love Holsteins.  We once had a less than perfect experience which was immediately taken care of by the manager in a very timely, polite and caring way. This is why there are no stars missing from my review... The way our concerns were addressed and taken care of was highly notable and appreciated.",

    "text": "Holsteins is a place that we went to on a whim. All I knew was that I REALLY wanted a burger so I couldn't think of better place to go than a place that specializes in burgers. The best part about this being a whim is that I went in having no expectations beforehand which is always great when experiencing something for the first time.   At first impressions, the restaurant is nothing particularly special. In fact, I found the images of the animals labeled by their \"food parts\" a bit disturbing. The service was average. Nothing to write home about.   I ordered the fries and burger, nothing outrageous. As I mentioned previously, I just wanted a burger.   They started off by giving out a little bucket of popcorn. I LOVED that popcorn and I'm not a popcorn eater. It had an odd taste to it, but odd in a good way. Also, it was BUTTERY and I love popcorn that has a lot of butter. That's the problem with popcorn now-a-days...they don't put enough butter on it.   Shortly after that, the burger and fries came out. Someone else mentioned how the fries taste like the fries one can buy in a bag at the supermarket and that is True. However, they taste like the good, expensive bag of fries that one can buy at the supermarket so I wasn't complaining. The burger was not bad. It was just okay. I've had better burgers.  Something cool though: apparently, the guy who played the brother on Seinfeld was sitting at the table next to mine.  It wasn't a big deal to me since I don't watch the show, but my mother, who I was with at the time, was starstruck.",

    "text": "Holy Cow this place was good! After a long trek from the East Coast to Las Vegas for a conference we were ravenous. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and decided to find an affordable place in house to satisfy our hunger. We ended up settling on Holstein's due to the favorable reviews and the comfort of having a burger and fries. We were quickly seated around 6 pm on a Thursday night and were immediately given a nice bucket of popcorn (which means I will have to break out the floss later). Service was very friendly and our waiter was spot on with recommendations. I had the Steakhouse Burger which was cooked to absolute perfection. Cooking a burger correctly isn't that easy but Holstein's seems to have to process down pat. The steak fries are highly recommended. They also have an impressive beer collection if you need something to accompany your burger. We also ordered the lollipops for a dessert and these were more of a gimmick than an actual satisfying dessert. The only one that was worth eating again was the brownie one so don't waste your money here. The shakes looked yummy but I was too stuffed to attempt one after the lollipops (although I plan on heading back before leaving). The dessert wasn't enough to detract from a solid 4 stars though. You can't go wrong here and the price is good for a restaurant on the Strip.",

The prices are reasonable for a restaurant in the strip inside a brand new hotel right across a popular club. Now I ordered \"Hen House\" Which was a burger with a beef patty, bacon and egg, served with some veggies. I thought it was just going to be another burger, but when i took the 1st bite it was so juicy and all the flavors of the 3 kinds of beef, bacon, and egg just mixed in together so perfectly. I had it cooked at medium and it was perfect. The service was good and always attended to our needs. The skinny fries was also just perfect, just enough crunchyness and wasnt that oily. Perfect for Pre or Post Marquee Clubbin food.",

    "text": "Walked through the Cosmopolitan, very pretty strung with strings of shiny beads or crystals yet fairly understated for a LV hotel. The art through the small restaurant is everywhere even the ceiling of the women's room: Warholish glass hangings of an adorable pig dressed up like a cow, paintings of more of these pigs along with cows. Reminiscent of cartoons or tatoos, the pigs encourage the eating of beef although I'm not sure why they would be dressed up like the cows. A local tattoo artist did all the art giving the restaurant a casual gallery feel. Arrived at 11 opening on a Saturday and were seated right away. Tables were very close to full when we left at noon.   Popcorn in a metal pail was on the table. The server immediately offered and brought waters for the table on the 115 degree day. The Classic Burger was very good, juicy and served with a metal pail of fries and a requested side of fresh jalapenos. The Gold Standard Burger for a few more dollars had upgraded toppings - smoked bacon and aged goat cheddar making a big difference in taste between the two - as well as a slightly better advantage from the dry aged sirloin. The burgers and fries were very good. Serious Eats lists this as the best burger in Vegas and it may be as I've not tried others. The sliders looked a bit drier than the bigger burgers as usual. The fries were fine. I would have liked to try more items including the sweet potato fries. The prices are resort-like as you might expect - $14 for classic burger and fries. The kid meal came with a very standard vanilla sundae. The ketchup threw me off as it was not Heinz.  The service was perfect.",

Our flight was late and we landed in Las Vegas around 8:30 PM, so by the time we got there it was already way past my EST dinner.  The hostess was pleasant and directed us to another hostess in the dining room, who seated us right away.  Our waitress was attentive without being too in-our-face (because seriously, we were grouchy hungry and tired and just wanted food).  The drink menu is extensive and they have a great selection of beer.  I ordered the Ahi Sliders and my boyfriend had the Nom Nom Burger.  We split his fries and it was plenty of food, since they also do popcorn for the table as an appetizer.  My only downside is that the seating is a little close together, but I've noticed that's pretty much the norm everywhere in town.  Very European to me- maybe I just like my space?  Otherwise, an awesome burger joint that is not presumptous and doesn't try to be anything else other than seriously good grub.",

I also tried one of the mini-burgers but it was small and maybe difficult to make a patty that size very juicy, so I would go with the full sized burger next time. Most of the food on the menu was burgers and fries so go if that is what you are in the mood for and you want a lot of options in that category.

I dont know who, in the marketing department, approved the visuals of the menu.  Kimchee Quesadilla - great! Pork Bun Sliders - fab! Never had them like that anywhere, but the menu is just blah.  It is VERY reasonably priced for being in such a fancy hotel.  What I liked about this place was that I was able to order my food here and take it to the beautiful Chandalier and eat it there w/a cocktail.  Also I went there on Friday night to eat and was able to leave with a free water refill in a plastic cup.  The next night, same situation and I had to pay $1.00 for a water refill to go.  Seriously?  It's a dollar, but still!",

    "text": "\"That's a pretty f****** good milkshake. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty f******g good.\" Vincent from Pulp Fiction  Milkshakes are delicious! Expensive, but delicious! Seriously, that was the first thing that flashes in my head when I think of that milkshake. We got the black and white malted, and unf, I would love to have it again. Don't know if it was worth the price though.   So I like it. Got the Bulgogi burger because 1) I love bulgogi burgers and 2) I don't remember the last time I had one.  My verdict? You know, it was good, but there needs to be more kimchi (hello, I'm Korean), the marinade is weaksauce (seriously needs more), and I don't think I'm a fan of a bulgogi burger made with ground beef and no mayo. It's not a bad burger, just not for me. I would've liked it a little more like how my mom makes it, or how I'm used to in Korea: lots of thin slices of delicious, tender, fragrant marinated beef with some mayo.  Atmosphere was great. I like eating at a trendy place with a DJ spinning. It's nice and it gives it a club atmosphere. The wait staff was really friendly, and the food came out pretty fast. I love how things come out in little buckets. Cute!  Portions are... on the smaller side. Maybe I'm used to mountains of fries coming out with my burgers, but it was a little bit of a let down.  I also didn't realize that this place only serves burgers. I felt so bad for my boyfriend because he does NOT under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES for reasons fuzzy eat burgers. There was almost nothing for him to eat, and so he barely ate anything. He got the Meatball Grinder, and it was a super tiny order on buns, which he didn't eat. He liked the meatballs... but seriously wasn't enough food for him.  If you eat here, make sure that everyone is okay with eating burgers.",

I never eat turkey burgers but it sounded so good.  It was delicious!   First off, this burger was huge! The bun was so perfect.  It was light, crispy and had a little bit of a sweet taste to it.  Delish! Everything was super fresh! The fries, I could have eaten at least 3 servings of them! The onion rings were super good also.  I wish i would have had a milkshake from there, they all sounded so good!   My cousin got the El Machete (sp?) burger.  it was cooked perfectly!!!!After seeing that burger and how it was cooked, made me wish i would have gotten a beef burger, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from getting the turkey burger.   we also had fried pickles which were delicious! The aioli sauce they came with was really good and creamy.  It had a different taste to it.  The pickles were super crispy and the batter was seasoned so well! Some times friend pickles can be super salty, but these ones were perfect and the batter didn't come off of them after you took a bite!   I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual, but delicious place to eat on the strip.",

I had The Gold Standard with a fried egg both times. It was just so good, I didn't feel the need to order anything else. My burger was perfectly medium rare both times and all of the ingredients went together beautifully (including the bun, which can really make or break my enthusiasm towards a burger). Call me sheltered, but I don't think I've had a burger with arugula on it before. And I am a cheeseburger fiend.  My boyfriend and I split a Drunken Monkey milkshake the first time we went and while it wasn't exactly strong, it was still freaking delicious.   Overall, the quality of the food was consistent and much higher than I expected. I don't remember having a problem with the service either.

Sweet and salty never tasted so good! The \"Urth Burger\" was also a good choice, and didn't feel guilty after eating it.   This is an overall fantastic place to eat.",

    "text": "After hearing so much about Holsteins, I had to try it during my first trip to Vegas. I waa not disappointed. I made reservations on open table since I'd heard it can get busy. The restaurant even called that morning to confirm my reservation. Pretty impressed considering this is a Millennial restaurant. My friend and I arrived at 1pm sharp and were promptly seated. The restaurant has a separate bar area but both have a lively atmosphere. Our waiter have us some time to look over the menu, and brought a small bucket of their complimentary popcorn which my friend declared was \"addicting.\" We caught a glimpse of a burger going out to a table and they're huge! Way too much for me. Our waiter asked if it was our first time dining there. When we said yes he gave us a few suggestions. We took his digestion and decided to split a Rising Sun burger with sweet potato fries and a lobster roll with regular fries. We also ordered the Philly egg rolls. In case you hadn't heard, Holsteins is known for their milkshakes. I ordered a black and whire, and my friend got a creme bruise. Both were amazing. The Philly egg rolls were delicious. The burger was tasty. Tempura avocado won me over. The only disappointment was the lobster roll. It was just ok. Not worth the price or the calories.   Service was definitely above average. My water glass was never empty and all of my questions were well answered. Plus since I asked for a souvenir or waiter gave me a drink koozy. Woohoo! Any way I can't wait to go back and try another burger and shake.",

Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, though it took a while for our food to come out.  I ordered the Rising Sun burger (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo & tempura avocado); my cousins ordered the Hen House burger (beef with fried egg & bacon); my sister ordered the Chopped Salad.  Salad was pretty normal; I personally recommend trying one of their specialty burgers.  Both of the burgers we ordered were tasty; I think the Rising Sun is creative (though I knew I wouldn't really like the teriyaki glaze all that much - a bit strong).  But I loved the crispy yams and tempura avocado in my burger.  You can also order special add-ons to any of their burgers, such as fried egg and foie gras torchon - yum!  We ordered all of our dishes with the shoestring fries, which were also pretty tasty.  They have a pretty comprehensive beer list including a lot of microbrews.  They also have a wide range of shakes - including alcoholic shakes - but I was too full to try them out.  Overall, I will probably return - for lunch or dinner - as I think they offer reasonably priced, high quality, creative menu items at Holsteins.  Next time I'll try a shake too!  Solid four stars.",

They have fun art on the walls, friendly service and amazing food. I got the rising sun kobe beef burger and wow, so delicious. It had tempura avocado with this teriyaki glaze making it a truly original burger.   Milkshakes are my favorite. So when going to a place the specializes in milkshakes, let alone 'adult' milkshakes I get truly stoked. This place came through on a glorious milkshake. I got the red velvet milkshake and it came in a big glass, as well as the extra metal cup pretty much meaning you got two milkshakes.   The calamari was bomb too!",

For my main course I ordered the Rising Sun with sweet potato fries.  The burger was pretty tasty,  but my fries where a little cold and soggy.  I also had the Maple Bacon shake, which was pretty good.  Great vibe in the restaurant.  Overall experience was great.  The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because when we walked in the smell was pretty bad, like the tables where wiped down with dirty rags.

Located inside of The Cosmopolitan, this is THE place to sip on the greatest boozy milkshake you can find on the strip and probably all of Nevada.  Based on the Yelp reviews talking about how \"HUGE\" the milkshakes are, my mom and I arrived at Holsteins with the intentions of sharing a milkshake for a \"light\" lunch---well, you know... as light as having a milkshake for lunch can be! When our Bailey's infused Oreo milkshake arrived, we both started laughing and ordered another one. Unless you're having a burger and fries with a milkshake, DON'T SHARE. Why?  A) They're not THAAAAT big.  B) They're too flippin' delicious to share.   The Oreo milkshake is rich, creamy, and the flavor is about 1600 stories above what you're used to getting from an Oreo milkshake. Even if you get full, you won't want to stop drinking this thing. It's not excessively sweet as some milkshakes can be, so you won't get sick or tired of slurping and sipping the whole thing. I guarantee you that you'll drink both the milkshake they bring you in the fancy glass along with the extra milkshake they bring you in a metal shaker.  I can't wait to come back for another milkshake some day...",

We were staying at the Aria, exhausted from a long day of walking, and wanted to get a good dinner with the least amount of pretention. Holstein's fit the bill! We went on a Saturday night @ about 8:00pm. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which was fine because lemme tell you the best people watching in Vegas takes place across the way at the Marquee nightclub -- the shortest skirts, the highest stripper heels, and the douchiest men. My husband and I had a blast watching trainwreck after trainwreck pass by.  Oh wait this is a burger joint review! So yeah. Urth burger = Awesome. Got a dirty monkey shake but didn't taste any of the alcohol and didn't feel it either, but that's OK because it was yummy enough on it's own. Our waiter was cool and attentive, and this was just an overall fun place to eat. We had fun interpretting the paintings, too! Go!",

A burger and soda will run you about $25 - not bad considering the location.",

I would recommend making reservations if you can. It can get busy around lunch time.",

    "text": "I make it a point to try all the fancy burger places that pop up in Vegas.     Holsteins is definitely one of the best.   I'd say the burgers are probably better then Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay.  And i'd probably end up frequenting Holsteins more then Burger Bar due to the Cosmo being in a much better location on The Strip.  I got the Gold Standard which is the sirloin burger with all the trimings.   I knew the burger wasn't going to disappoint after the first bite of the nicely toasted bun.  You cannot believe how many burger places fail to toast the buns correctly.    The aged goat cheddar was a little too much though I think.   Halfway into the burger and the taste of the cheese was getting old.  It might have been better with just regular aged cheddar.    I did find that adding some horseradish to the burger was a nice compliment to the goat cheese.  You'd think a good burger would be easy to make but a lot of places fail.  You want to be able to taste the burger patty, the cheese, the bacon, and whatever else is on the burger both distinctly and as a combination.  A lot of places make their burgers so you can only taste one or two of the ingredients.   Holsteins does a good job of creating a \"complete\" burger experience  :)  The other main attraction of Holsteins is the alcoholic shakes.  They were ok i guess,  none of the shakes really have much alcohol in them so to me these are basically just regular shakes.",

    "text": "I had a strange craving to try this place, as I always passed by on the way to the \"secret\" pizzeria. The gourmet burger craze is sweeping the industry right now, and of course it landed at the new Cosmo hotel. We had some time to kill in between lunch and dinner, so we dropped by for a relatively small snack. The 3-stars is strictly just for the few items we ordered.  Walking through the bar, there was a strong \"wet rag\" stench that permeated throughout the area. It was weird. Then my eyes moved over to see people sucking down on shakes. I have to admit, those \"bamboozled\" shakes looked intriguing, even if they were $11. Plus, they had alcohol in them. They need to do a shake challenge here, pronto.  My wife and I decided to split an appetizer and a burger. On the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered the philly cheese steak spring rolls and the \"Hook\" burger. The inside of the spring rolls were still raw and doughy, and you could still see some of the flour from the egg roll wrapper. The filling inside was nasty. Little brown bits of meat drenched in a cheese whiz like gooey sauce. $12 for 3!  We told the waiter, and he was nice enough to take it away, and we could order something else. We opted for the fried dill spear pickles, which were delicious. The tart and tangy, crisp crunch of the pickles combined with a side of prosciutto and salami was a fantastic combination.  As for the burger, there was nothing terribly complex about it, but it was executed well. Whereas others grind their salmon to make a patty, here it was left untouched. Just lightly seared and cooked to a medium, topped with house cured gravlax (fancy term for lox). Coupled with the caper herb mayo, It was a tasty burger.",

I always seem to go back to the Gold Standard, it's probably my favorite burger there. Everything is a bit expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for... Although they could be a little lower. Half a star down for that.  The popcorn in buckets while you wait definitely help settle your stomach down a bit. It's so delicious, and I never thought a higher-end restaurant pulled off popcorn as an appetizer so well.  The other reason they don't have five stars is because of their service. It always seems to take forever to get things. Whether with three people, or a group of high schoolers, it always takes forever.

Whether by a voters choice in the local newspaper, a popular magazine writing the claim, word on the street, or just the restaurant making the claim itself. Supposedly Holsteins has the best burger in Vegas. It's a highly subjective claim.  I like the decor here. It's cute and modern. Location is prime and there's plenty of foot traffic as it's right by Marquee. It's always constantly busy whenever we walk by on our way to Wicked Spoon.  The food selection here is pretty vast. It's not just burgers and shakes. There's salads and a large appetizer selection. Their cocktail section looks like a dessert menu. But I came here for their burgers.  The Rising Sun: Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado  The burger came with a side of fries. The burger was large and the medium beef patty was perfect. It was a great burger overall, however it wasn't the best Japanese infused burger I've had. So I cannot agree that this is the best burger in Vegas. Maybe top 3.  The service was excellent. The server made a mistake on the order, when I notified her, she promptly corrected the receipt with a smile.",

The chocolate and oreo shake couldn't compare. If I was offered a box of cereal and a box of oreos, I'd most likely go for the oreos. But in the case of the shakes, cereal bar blew me away.   The Rising Sun Burger was pretty good, but what I liked more was the Crispy Pork Belly Buns. The lobster mac and cheese was great with a fair amount of lobster. For $16, I wished they would've given more mac. The photos make it look bigger than it actually is. That, or my bf ate most of it when I was drunk off the shake. The burger is huge though.

    "text": "They should rename this place Holsteins Beers and Buns. The beer selection was amazing and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all 132 beers!   After ordering our beers, it was time to pick a burger. I had the nom nom burger. This was Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chops and 1,000 island dressing. I wasn't impressed with my burger, it was just okay. I asked for medium and it came out well done so my burger was pretty dry and lacking juices.   My boyfriend got the steakhouse burger (Beef patty crusted with black pepper, Holsteins creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, and Swiss cheese). This was much better than my burger! However, he ordered medium rare and it was more cooked than he wanted.   We both got fries with our burgers and they were just okay. We like our fries more crispy. Our favorite part of our meals were our beers. We are interested in coming back for another drink sometime!",

The prices were as can be expected from Vegas, so upward of $15 for a burger.  I ordered a turkey burger which was cooked really, really well!  Usually you think turkey burger and you think it'll be a super dry hockey puck.  Not here.  The meat was flavorful and juicy. Yes, I said juicy!  I would definitely come back for this burger again.  The spicy buffalo dipping sauce was misleading and wasn't that great.  The onion rings and fries were crispy and flavorful though.  All in all, a solid spot to get a decent burger.  It beats out all the fast dining restaurants that are scattered about on the strip for sure!",

    "text": "This place has been reviewed a bit on Yelp, and the 4-star is about par for the course. The atmosphere is very lively, but that might have been just because there was a Thursday night football game going on at the time of our meal. Either way, it definitely seems like the place gets a lot of action. Gotta love the decor of the place: cartoon cows   We had the Thai Beef Salad, the Gold Standard, and the Oreo shake. Watch out for the Thai Beef Salad! It's good but it has a sweet/super spicy sauce mixed into it... it tasted a lot like Korean gochujang. The Gold Standard lived exactly to its expectations, but what else would expect from a $20 burger? And the Oreo shake was the perfect mix of thick consistency: not too watery but not thick enough that you feel like you need to suck your brains out through the straw.   The place IS expensive (my only semi gripe about the place... it's hard to justify buying a $20 beef sandwich) but you're in Vegas so just deal with it! The place is far from a 'deal' meal, but I would still highly recommend it.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for a late dinner while on our Anniversary Vacation in Vegas. After a 25 minute wait, we were finally seated. It was crowded and LOUD with people and the music. The walls had humurous cartoon murals of a pig in a cow suit doing hilarious things...much funnier than the Chik-fil-a cows! The food was very good and delicious! My wife ordered the Blueberry Pie shake without the booze in it (we're pregnant) and it was just as good as eating the pie itself! Apparently all the shakes can be made with out alcohol, which makes it a bit more helpful if you have kids in tow, although the crowd seemed to be mostly young partiers at that time of night.  She ordered the Chicago Dogs which came in 3 mini hot dogs, they were flavorful and the bun was really tender. I took the server's advice and tried the Gold Standard burger (which was one of the number one rated burgers on the LV Strip so I was told). It was very good and juicy full of flavor and on a good bun. The Shoestring fries came out a bit cold. Everything was pricey as expected for a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan but the quality was all there along with the service. Overall, minus the LouD noise and the wait time, it was worth the good tasting food!",

    "text": "It's a gastropub style burger joint with Vegas strip pricing and fancier burgers.  Heard a lot about their milkshakes, ordered a black and white.  Just like everyone says, it's a good milkshake.  So it's definitely worth coming here just for that.  Black truffle lobster mac 'n cheese: black truffle was too strong.  If the lobster didn't have a distinct color, you wouldn't have even noticed it was in there.  Sauce was underseasoned.  The chip garnish was interesting, but I don't see how that plays in with the dish.  Superfluous...but not a negative.  Korean kimchi hot dogs: was very intrigued by this menu item, but it was underwhelming.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog with bbq sauce.  Didn't get the sour punch from the kimchi, nor did I even notice pork belly in it.  The bun was very soft and delicious though.    Gold standard burger: goat cheese cheddar was wonderful, and my burger was cooked to medium rare which is a plus.  Overall, burger was good, but lacked seasoning.  Bun was nicely done.    Service was spot-on.  We sat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait for a table, so I can't say much for the actual dining service.    For what it is, and being in Vegas, I'd say it's a good spot to go for a burger fix.  Is it a top tier burger place?  Remains to be seen when I come back again, because there's a lot of stiff competition out there.",

I'd quickly pick Red Robin over this place any time. It's located at the heart of The Cosmopolitan, so it's an easy try for anyone who is starving and looking for some burger grub.

    "text": "Had high hopes for Holsteins. It didn't totally disappoint, but did run into some issues.  Had reservations for 7:30 as we had a concert to attend at 9 over at MGM. Figured it wouldn't take more than an hour to enjoy a meal. Came to the desk about 5 min. prior. Took them over 10 minutes to get us seated.   The server was friendly and helpful. Ordered the Oreo shake - a MUST try. So, so good I nearly drank the whole thing before my meal came.  For my meal I ordered the Hen House burger add cheese....cooked medium. My brother ordered the Carbonara Chicken sandwhich.  It was busy so it took about 15 min for our orders to come out after drinks were served. No biggie, to be expected. First thing I noticed was that they forgot the cheese on my burger. Again, no huge deal. Took a while for the waiter to come back around but got me some cheese on a plate.  Next, I cut into the burger. As I ordered it to be cooked medium I expected cooked with a little bit of pink. Unfortunately, it was cooked near rare. I ate two bites luckily from the outside (more cooked) part of the burger before noticing. By this time it was getting close to having to leave for the concert. Server was great and offered to have it re-cooked. As we needed to leave quickly he offered to have it placed in a to-go box but sadly we could not bring food into the concert.   This resulted in the burger being taken off the bill and the friendly manager offering us some cool nitrogen? type desert bites. Very much appreciated even though I sadly did not get to enjoy my meal. The chicken sandwhich was awesome (Def had to steal a bite from my brother). The shoe string fries were so-so.   Had purchased a groupon ($20 for use of $40) which the bill ended up being less than $30. Sad.",

    "text": "My bff and I recently stayed at the Cosmo and visited Holsteins twice. Here's how it went for us:  Day one - Bff had just finished running the Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. Vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  I started with an Absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    Then I ordered The Classic with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. I panicked and went with steakcut.  The burger was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. The fries were good, but nothing spectacular.  Day two - Bff and I both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  Absolut dirty martini? Yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. This time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  They were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  Truly great.  Then we both ordered a burger. I can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. It was awesome. We ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of onion rings. THOSE. WERE. EXCELLENT.  To summarize, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. The only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that I found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. On both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food.",

I would like a softer bun on the mini burgers though.  Fried green tomatoes are OK and not worth the price in my opinion (worst thing we ordered).  My wife had the \"Gold Standard\" burger with sweet potato fries as no duck fat fries were offered.  The aged beef was really good and the burger had great flavor overall (4 stars).  I actually like the buns they use for the burgers as they are somewhat soft and taste good.  She also had the \"Power Shake\" which was amazing as it was a good mix between shake and drinking yogurt (5 stars).  I ordered the Rising Sun burger with onion rings and a Brown Cow (Root beer float with pop rocks).  The burger was great but overcooked as I wanted medium and got medium well (4.5 stars).  Onion rings were a disappointment as I expected better (3 stars).  If you want a good dipping sauce ask for the spicy mayo used in the Rising Sun burger and add a little Ketchup to it for a good sauce for your fries and onion rings.  The Brown Cow was really good as they use a good root beer and ice cream for it (4 stars).  You get a lot of shake which is nice and the pop rocks are kind of fun addition to the drink.    Holsteins has decent service great shakes and some great hamburgers.  If the price and some of the items were better I would give this place five stars, but with some OK items and a somewhat hefty price I give them four stars.  Great food and worth eating here once while in Vegas if not more often depending on what you like to eat.  I want to try some of the other burgers and shakes though.",

My best friend and I had lunch here.  She has a serious food allergy and they accommodated her needs perfectly!  As I was lucky to get the chance to come back to Vegas recently with my younger daughter, I brought her here.  Again we had lunch and the food was great not to mention the shakes!  They are heavenly!  I had the Oreo with Baileys Irish creme and she had tiramisu shake!   Both were great!  And huge!  Service was great we had to wait for a bit but well worth it!   Don't hesitate to try this place, you will enjoy it.",

I got there right when they opened so it was easy to get a table. I ordered onion rings as an app....they were very good, but waaaay to much for one person. I asked them if they could make me a kobe beef burger done up as The Classic and they were happy to comply. They also brought some popcorn to my table. I didn't like it, but it was free so who cares. The burger was delicious, fries were good, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. Nothing to complain about, except it's probably a little pricey for my taste. I would probably not go back because there are so many places on the Strip i want to try, but if you like burgers you should check it out.",

Machete burger was nothing special- cooked properly, but possessing nothing out of the ordinary. It was to be expected for a generic $7 burger, but for nearly three times that, I expected more.",

    "text": "Believe the hype...this place is real. We ate here on a Saturday night and the food and atmosphere is awsome.  Quick Tip: make reservations or you'll be waiting for a while and do not ask for \"duck-fat fries\" because they don't serve it anymore  This place is situated inside the Comopolitan at City Center, it sits right across from the Chandelier room (?) and from Tao. The atmosphere is very modern, hip, trendy.  The server we had was awsome. She was very attentive to a larger group (we had 12 peeps) and patient with us.  On to the food: I had the fried pickles appetizer,  \"Rising sun\" burger with shoestring fries and \"Midas touch\" beer. The fried pickles were good, they bread and deep fried a regular size pickle that is sliced lengh-wise with the bomb ass dipping sauce (forgot what it was called). Burger = I had mine done medium, and it came out perfectly with T-L-O (tomato-lettuce-onions) you really can't describe in words how good this gourmet hamburger was other than to say, its on my list of top 3 hamburgers I've eaten. I really wanted to limit what other ingredients that made up the hamburger itself.  I wanted to taste the Kobe beef, and yes, please believe, all thats been said about Kobe beef.  The house made bread, I think, was the perfect ingredient to the hamburger, it was fresh, not too \"doughy\". The shoestring fries was \"eehh\" only thing that saved the fries was the dipping sauce I had leftover from the appetizer. It was more of an afterthought.  Beer = I could have gotten another one of these, Its made by Dogfish and it was really good. It really complimented my meal.   Next time I'm in Sin City, I will make it a point to make another stop here",

I do have issue with the hefty $11 price tag though (I'm assuming the \"alcohol\" contained within technically makes it a cocktail, thus the rational for the extraordinary cost - I really wish there was a $6 non-alcoholic version). Nevertheless, Holsteins definitely has the most interesting burgers in Las Vegas and definitely worth the try if you're big on non-traditional burgers.",

The wait time for the burger is quite long although we were sat down fairly quickly. Unfortunately, I was not pleased with the popcorn that they served us in the beginning. It is really to fill you up so that you don't expect too much out of the burger...  The sizes of the burgers are not generous at all. That is okay to me though, since I am all about the quality and I indeed ordered the Kobe Beef which SHOULD BE the best in the house. As I chowed down into the burger, I was not satisfied. For a burger, it was phenomenal, but for a KOBE BEEF burger, this wasn't that good. The size was not large, the quality for what it really should be was not up to par.   Finally, we ended off with a tasty shake which really made the meal okay. Holstein's is not bad it is not great, but it is acceptable.  I will come back if I am ever hungry for a burger while at the Cosmo.",

Then we got seated by Maria in a great booth, with really cool paintings.  Our server Sam came up and greeted us and told all the cool things we should try. I had the Rising Sun, likely due to me being asian, so it was kind of a default choice. Haha, amazing burger though! My date had a Thai salad, she's asian and on a diet. So it was very fitting. She said it was great!   Food was promptly delivered by what looked to be conjoined twins. Mardan & Edwin (not sure if that's their names) but they were nice and made sure we had all the things we needed to enjoy our meal.   Sam checked on us quickly and made sure our food was good. It was!   When it came time to get a desert a lady named Jade told us about this thing that looked like a burger, but was really ice cream. Good times!  The conjoined twins came and delivered our food again. Such good times around here.   Bussers on point, one even asked me how I kept so fit while eating burgers and deserts. Had a sweet mustache.   As we left, some guy in a suit wished us a great night and that we enjoy our stay.   Of course I'd come back!",

The Vegan Coconut Raspberry Shake is just awesome- it's topped with vegan marshmallow and fluffy vegan whipped cream that is divine. The second time I came here, which was recent, I brought a friend who's a huge skeptic of all things vegan, and even he admitted that the shake was actually wonderful, and better than the other (non-vegan) shakes he's had there in the past. However, they actually ran out of all their vegan burgers at that time, so we couldn't eat there. I suggest calling ahead to make sure they've got it in stock!",

I really enjoyed the brioche bun, but was kind of underwhelmed by the entire burger....perhaps I should have gone with the Rising Sun? Fries were mediocre at best.   Service was very friendly, but kinda slow. And we didn't get free popcorn :(  LOVED the cute little painted cows, and the location in the Cosmo is very convenient for hanging out on the Strip.  All in all, not bad but not the greatest I've ever had :) 3 solid stars!",

    "text": "As a vegan, I feel dirty and weird eating at a place called Holstein's. Why do so many themed restaurants (like burger places) think its clever to decorate their restaurant with the same animal they're also selling? That shit creeps me out.  Anyway, they have a few vegan options here and my sister and I were in desperate need of food. Their \"Urth-burger\" was actually really good and had all of my favorite toppings - avocado, avocado, avocado.  Oh and they have an alcoholic veganized milk-shake on the menu. It is damn delicious.   They also have a DJ playing pretty good tunes as you eat. I danced to Daft Punk while I stuffed my face.",

    "text": "The first of many Yelp reviews to come :)  Holsteins is located right smack in the middle of the Cosmopolitan. There's really no signs leading to this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a dim little restaurant in the corner of the floor. It was around dinner time on a Saturday night and the wait was only 15 minutes. When our name was called we were told by the hostess to walk down to the dining room to be seated. I found this a bit STRANGE considering there were so many servers walking around- I didn't know which one would be seating us. After a few awkward eye contacts, we were greeted by a nice young lady and shown to our table.   Food ordered: Billionaire Burger (Kobe Beef and Foie Gras) - I didn't like how the Kobe Beef masked the flavor of the Foie Gras, but it was still delicious. The Foie Gras was truly something special. I would pay $28 for the piece alone (Yes, this burger was $28). Urth Burger (House made veggie patty) - The veggie patty was a bit too mushy for my liking. I wanted a bit of a crunch, at least on the outer part of the patty. NOPE. The avocado didn't help the mushy theme either. The texture  wasn't pleasant at all. Don't get be wrong though, the flavors were definitely there. This burger went for $12-$15, I forgot. Not worth it. Shoestring Fries - SO GOOD. I love crispy, semi-burnt things, so these fries were PERFECT for me. Not that I'm saying it was burnt... but it was VERY crunchy. These fries were very, VERY thinly sliced. For those who want to taste to potato, go for the steak cut fries. Steak Cut Fries - Nothing too special about these fries. Very mediocre. Too much potato in my mouth!  The service was good. Dining was casual. Place is a bit dark, but it gives this place a nice vibe for a burger joint. In all, it was a good experience. Will come here again for the Billionaire Burger, nothing else. :)  TIP: Don't walk too fast after the hostess tells you to walk to the dining room to be seated... you'll be standing there like a lost child :/",

She pointed us in the direction of the bar and went proceeded to stand at the host station like Barbie.  We walked right by the bar and into the dining room and were stopped from self-seating ourselves by a busy server that spoke bimbo and was able to get through to the hostess to seat us properly.    Our server wasn't much better.  We sat for a good while before we discovered who would be taking care of us.  He gave us water and then went MIA. for a good 10 minutes before he came back to take our order.  It started to seem like the food was taking a little longer than it should when our server stopped by our table confused and was like, \"where's your food\"?  Um, shouldn't I be asking you that?  Aside from the airheads they had waiting on us, the food was actually pretty good.  For drinks, I had a Drunken Leprechaun.  However, by the time I got it, I wished it was more \"drunk\".  Two shots of Jameson were pretty undetectable in all that sweet, shakey goodness; lightly minty and sinfully rich.  Gotta love adult shakes tho, they had big ol' Bam-Boozled section on the menu just for em.  I just wish they'd triple up the boozled scale.  For food, El Machete; beef with chili, onions, pepperjack, lettuce, tomato and a spicy aioli.  Best damn burger I've ever eaten; big, complex flavors and a bad-ass juicy patty.  The fries, ala carte, were okay.    Too bad the service sucked the love for this place outta me.",

    "text": "Before my most recent Vegas trip, I did linger about just outside this restaurant and noticed the funny cow cartoons along the wall. I should have paid more attention to their menu than the art. However on this trip, I had a mission: Burger & Shake.  The Rising Sun burger was definitely a good start for me. The tangy teriyaki sauce contrasted well with the crispy yam and the deep fried tempura avocado.  The Rising Sun ($17) - Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado  Of course I had to order a milkshake(the Black and White) and yes, then add my favorite ingredient to help elevate this shake to a whole new level: A Shot of Expresso. What makes this place better than Max Brenner, they give you the excess shake in the blender cup! The shake was so damn good! And they too have an oreo cookie shake!  Service was very attentive. But I'm not too happy about being charged an extra full drink for that expresso shot.  My mission was clearly a burger and a shake. But considering I only had a one sampling, I will definitely have to come back to try the other burgers and shakes ( hence the 4 instead of 5 stars). May have just found my milkshake spot alternative to Max Brenner. Definitely a great spot to meet for lunch or just watch the game in the lounge area or bar.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholsteinslv.com%2Fmenu%2F&s=05d48160a209c08b40c468a30985ea00af4282595f9276eb4cb15dd7859cf0b2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">holsteinslv.com/menu</a>",

Decided to give Holsteins a shot after seeing all the happy reviews they received for their burgers + shakes.   Nom Nom Burger - The burger consists of Kobe beef patty, cheddar cheese, chips and thousand island sauce. Sound incredibly delicious, isn't it? Sadly, no! It was unfortunate to have something so appealing in front of your eyes... only to bite into something so tough and dry... lacking any flavor and juiciness you expect.   The complimentary popcorn was probably the only enjoyable thing we had that night. Overall, my experience dining at Holsteins was disappointing, not to mention, the pricing here was quite high for a burger place. Not worth it.",

    "text": "This place will end you. After an early evening dinner followed by a show and a lot of walking, we decided to stop by for dessert around midnight. Their milkshakes are great, they said. You'll enjoy them, they said. And while the milkshakes were delicious and exactly what we wanted, there was no way in hell that any normal human can get through one of them if they had eaten more than a single leaf within three hours before this event. Imagine a milkshake, brought in the classic conical milkshake glass, except that the glass has been coated, inside and out, in chocolate syrup and crushed nuts or other miscellaneous crunchies, that what seems like a pound of brownie has been mixed in with the ice cream, and the entire thing has been topped with an ice cream sandwich made from two chocolate chip cookies and a full inch of ice cream in between them.  The entire thing rises high above the lip of the glass and is carefully positioned to balance an entire week's worth of desserts onto the supposed beverage.  And that was the more reasonable one. The other milkshake we ordered contained an actual doughnut on top of it. We were only able to take down approximately 65% of each milkshake, and that was putting forth a lot of effort and borderline forcing ourselves into a state of diabetic coma.  In all seriousness, the milkshakes were delicious. You can get them with or without alcohol. (We got them without. I can only imagine the scenes of destruction that would have resulted if they had been spiked.)  You're already in Vegas, a town built on excess. Go for it. Stop by and give these bad boys a try. You'll thank me.",

Our server was Yves and she was very friendly, attentive and personable. Top notch service by all staff members here. Lots of teamwork with other staff members coming by to clear the table, drop off food or assist as needed.  First off, order the milkshake! It's pretty ridiculous and just heavenly. You can order any of the boozy shakes without booze for $3 less than price listed. We got the Donutella with booze and S'mores without booze for the kids. The shakes are huge and be prepared to fill up. Along with the shakes that come out, they give you a metal shaker with extra leftover milkshake. No joke. Two shakes was more than enough for our party of 5.   For dinner we got two orders of mini beef sliders for the kids off kids menu. Kids meals are pricey at $9 but comes with a side and vanilla sundae. Lots of food. We only got two for our three kids. For my husband and I we decided to share the Golden Standard. Everything was tasty and we were absolutely full. When Yves reminded us that the kids still get vanilla sundaes, we couldn't believe the amount of food you get. The kids barely touched dessert but they still made an effort. Lol.  I must say we really wanted their amazing poutine fries made with a Guinness beer base...unfortunately, they no longer offer this!!! Oh man. Bummer.  All in all, Holsteins is a cool spot and a first for the kids and they loved it. They were totally dazzled by the milkshakes!!! Enough said. Pricey dinner but quality everything. Thanks Yves!",

They have these cool tables where you can watch TV. It was the semi-finals to the hockey game and we decided to watch with the locals. My friend ordered a cookies and cream alcoholic shake and I ordered a club soda. His shake was humongous! I had a bite of the cookie and it was good.  I ordered the Fun-ghi Burger without the caramelized onion. The burger came with forest mushrooms, gruyere cheese, frisbee, and truffle mayo. I requested a lettuce wrap and they obliged. The burger was big and very filling. I barely finished my burger. I upgraded to onion rings and the rings were delicious. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish my rings, but wished I was able to take it back to my room.   Service was great and we were checked on appropriately. Liked the ambiance and noticed a lot of families dining here. If you want to avoid the kiddos, then sit in the bar.",

When we got there they told us a 20 min wait but a lot of tables were open. Having worked as a server I understand that open tables does not mean available staff for those tables. No worries. But then 25 mins later we hadn't been called so we asked and the hostess said oh I guess I'll check and she sat us right away. Like she had forgot to check at any point.   Our waitress was super nice the food came out quickly. We got ice cream shakes and burgers and they were good. At the end we had to try to figure out how to split the check between 6 people because our waitress said she couldn't split it for groups bigger then 4. I didn't get this and it was a pretty big hassle especially after having drinks.",

    "text": "Was in Vegas for a conference and what caught my eye about this place was the milkshakes they served, boozy and otherwise. Didn't realize how far it was from MGM, but not a big deal.   When we got there, there wasn't a wait, but I was worried about the seating because it looks like the tables were really low and seats were kind of high, but that was front of the house seating so to speak. The decor in the restaurant is pretty funny with brightly colored cows and stuff painted on the walls and the anatomy of cows and pigs all over. Our server was pretty nice and attentive, so props to him, but I don't remember his name.  The popcorn is AMAZING and I'm not usually a big fan of popcorn, but we asked for a second bucket. I will say, a bigger bucket for parties of 3 or more should be considered because I wanted to ask for a to-go container for the popcorn specifically. I got their buffalo wings because I wasn't all that hungry and the other two with me got salads. I liked that the wings had flavor and not just some heat to them and they weren't over dressed. The salads were apparently good and also pretty decently sized. Nobody got a milkshake sadly just because once we read the ingredients, there was too much going on for our liking. More power to the people that like a bunch of stuff in their milkshakes.",

We were in a large group (20 or so), but we had a reservation, and they could have given us more than one server. It took about 20 minutes every time we needed a drink refill.  We ended up ordering a tiny $11 plate of lettuce (I almost sent it back, because my salad was supposed to have 7 things in it.  I eventually found them hidden in the lettuce.  They were all about the size of a fourth of a corn kernel, and there were maybe 10 of them total.)  We also ordered a $9 lamb sausage that was about the size of my pinkie, and came in a bun 4 times its size.  It would have been good if the proportions were more reasonable.  We had some fries, and they were fine.  The rising sun burger ($16) we had was actually really good, and it's the only reason I'm adding a second star.  I would consider coming back for that, and nothing else. What annoyed me most about this evening (other than my crappy salad) is that when we got the check, the server brought us a copy of the total, and an itemized receipt...the itemized receipt was torn in a weird place.  We realized that it was actually torn just before the part where it would have said that gratuity was included, because of our large party.  This girl wanted to conceal that fact, and have us pay gratuity again on a check that had already included it.  That's some serious BS, and I'm really glad we caught it.",

The great thing about them was that when you sign in, they take down your phone number so they can contact you when your table is available. We were told to wait 20 minutes, but we barely waited 10. We got seated pretty fast and service was friendly. I love the decorations they have in the restaurant. The alcoholic milkshakes got my attention. I am SO glad I tried it! I got the mint chocolate chip flavor milkshake. It was the BOMB! You barely taste the alcohol only the after taste, but it's definitely something new and something everyone over the age should try when visiting this place. My friend and I split a burger (I forgot what it was called) and sea steak sliders. I just like to try different things and let me tell you, you can't go wrong with either one of them! But.. I'm glad we shared the burger and the sliders. The burger is pretty big so I don't know if I could've finished it all by myself. The burger was juicy and a greasy, which was a great balance with the refreshing sea steak sliders. It took a while to get our orders, but it's understandable because it was pretty busy and we were a party of 5. The complimentary popcorn sure made it better.",

I had the Gold Standard with Onion Rings.  The burger patty was cooked medium, and all the fix-ins complimented the burger well...but I can't get over the fact that the bun was so terrible.   The burger bun was dry, cold, and slightly stale...it was so terrible that I could not enjoy my burger.  I almost had to eat the burger patty by itself and toss the bun.   Everyone else in my group agreed, the burger bun was stale and dry.  If it wasn't for the dry bun, I might be able to give it 4-stars, but I just could not enjoy my burger on a stale dry bun!  The burger patty was good quality, but I can't enjoy a burger without a good bun!  The onion rings were okay, i've had better, I really wished they were beer battered.   For the price of the burgers, I really expected a more satisfying burger; the burgers were not that big to begin with.  I think I will stick to Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay.  As with everything else in Vegas, high prices don't always equate to high quality.   My meal came out to be $25 for a burger, onion rings, and water...for this price I expect a damn good burger, which Holsteins did not deliver.  Burger bar has much better burgers, and better prices!",

    "text": "So I was staying in the Cosmopolitan (which I also recommend and is probably one of the most amazing hotels I've ever stayed at) and had to catch my plane soon, but wanted a quick lunch.  We decided to go to the cluster of restaurants near the Marquee Club.  I am soooo glad I decided to squeeze it in.  You must get a shake and a burger.  I had a tiramisu shake (and they give you the leftover mix, which I think is nice) and a spicy (forget name) burger.  Everything was awesome.  Since I was in a hurry we sat in the lounge.  Service was decently quick.  We even saw some NBA guys eating at the bar with their USA backpacks, they seemed in a hurry too.  Don't worry though, they have a full restaurant seating area behind the bar/lounge.",

    "text": "So we decided to go here our last day at the cosmopolitan before heading back down to LA, and i have to say, it was a very good decision.  Service: excellent.  our waiter was always around while we were looking through the menu to give us suggestions and answer any questions and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  drinks were always full and extra sauce was brought out fast  Atmosphere: a little casual and kicked back feeling, but still a little more fancy than most casual places just due to how it felt in the restaurant probably because of the lighting and the layout  Food:  (the most important part, right?) I will start out by saying that if you have ever been to Unami, it is very much like that, but i felt it was even better.  I got the gold standard burger, and it was very good.  the patty had that great fluffy texture and not super packed like at most burger places which made it extra juicy.  the tomato mix they put on it made it very much like bruschetta and was a nice change from just a plain old tomato.  the arugula on it added a nice bitter taste to contrast with the tomato and meat, along  with the bite from the goat cheese cheddar that they put on.  just to throw it out there, the goat cheese threw me for a loop because i am used to goat cheese being very soft like it usually is, but the goat cheese cheddar on the burger was a pretty hard texture, almost like a parmesan but it still had that amazing goat cheese taste.  the bun was to me a standard type bun that you would expect at a gourmet burger place, but it was toasted just right and soaked up the juice from the burger patty very well.  I also got an order of the shoestring fries which were seasoned perfectly that i didn't even bother asking for anything to do them in (i usually dip my fries in blue cheese dressing).  the fries were very crispy since they were pretty thin, but salted perfectly and there was a decent sized portion of them also.  the only thing that wasn't super awesome to me was the prices (i believe the gold standard was around $17) but for typical vegas prices, it isn't too bad.  and considering it was bigger and better than unami for around the same price, it isn't that big of a deal.  I will return again to try something different off the menu.",

    "text": "It all started with The Drunken Monkey which pretty much should be my tribal name from now on. Hands down the best milkshake I have ever tasted in my life!!! It's Malted Banana Gelato, Peanut Butter Crisps, Frangelico and priced at $11. Whoever decided to start making alcoholic milkshakes should get a medal. Genius. It is the perfect marriage of flavor without being to overpowered by the booze.   On to the grub.  Starters:  Philly Cheez Steak Spring Rolls with udder sauce $11  They were alright, but could have used more seasoning. The meat was tender and the rolls were crisp. I did not enjoy the utter sauce which bares similarities to ketchup, but with more vinegar.   For the beef and fake beef selections we had:  The Classic with Two Dollar Cheddar (ridiculous) $15  Urth Burger with One Dollar Swiss $14  New Delhi Chicken $14  All served with shoestring fries and that gross utter sauce. I ordered Ranch, of course, and they turned out to be the winner of best potato in a supporting role to compliment the Monkey Shake. As far as the burgers go my burger was ordered Medium and came to me very well done. I ate one third of it. The bun was buttery and toasted to perfection and that two dollar cheddar was worth it. The veggie burger was probably my favorite of the three with a strong mushroom taste. Pretty good. The Chicken burger could have been executed better. The chicken lacked taste and the only saving grace was the apricot-date chutney on top.   Overall I will absolutely be back because The Cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistline captive. The menu has tons of creative options that intrigue me such as Bull's Balls, Crispy Pork Belly Bun and Duck Confit Street Tacos. I will get the tribe together and give it another go at it!",

    "text": "I'd say the food here is a solid 4 stars, but a few things during my experiences here dropped it down to 3.   As an appetizer, I had the truffle lobster mac n' cheese and was very disappointed by this. For the low, low price of just $16.50, you get a small dish, about the size of an iphone, full of mac n' cheese! The lobster seemed almost nonexistent and the truffle was extremely light, too light. Although the saving point for this was the bite-sized BLT that came with it.   For burgers, the one that stood out the most was the El Machete. Wow that is a good burger and it has a very nice kick to it from the spicy aioli that it's topped with. Their burgers are juicy and cooked the way you like it. Their buns are absolutely amazing too. They're dense enough to uphold those thick, juicy burgers with all their glorious toppings too. But not too dense where it's like you're eating styrofoam.   My bf had the Long Horn, since what man doesn't like EXTRA meat? It was decent but I like my burgers to have more veggies on them. He liked it also, but agreed that the El Machete just tasted better.   Their matchstick fries are fried to perfection so they're super crispy on the outside but smooth in the center. However we also had the onion rings and they came out extremely dark in color, so over fried. They didn't taste too bad though.   I LOVE their milkshakes! If only they weren't so expensive! You CAN get them non-alcoholic, which will shave off about 3 bucks from the menu price. They have some tasty concoctions, including their Drunken Monkey, which is my favorite. I tried the Cap'n Crunch and it was good, but it tasted just like a vanilla milkshake with some ground up cereal. Still not bad though.   The cons of this place are mostly due to the environment of the restaurant.. The hostess was not friendly at all and barely even said hello. The server was friendly enough, although she could have been more attentive. She disappeared for a while after asking what we'd like to drink. The music is extremely loud. We had heard that the music is usually lower earlier in the day, but the last time I came, it was 6pm and I was still yelling over the music.  This isn't the best place for a nice dinner and conversation, but they can cook up a mean burger. Also, they change the paintings on the walls every once in a while, which is pretty snazzy!",

    "text": "After landing in Vegas, I was starving and I wanted a great burger. I headed to Holsteins in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Located on the second level, it fits right in with the other contemporary dining options there.  I ordered the Gold Standard ($18), a dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, and a garlic-chive aioli which I got on the side. The burger was thick, juicy, and flavorful. The bacon and goat cheese complimented the meat well, although a standard cheddar or american cheese would've worked probably even better in my opinion. I added some of the aioli which created a unique taste on the burger that I hadn't had before while the arugula added a little freshness to the sandwich.  It was nice that the burger was served with fries but they weren't very good. For the most part, they were overly crispy on the outside and some of the fries were clumped and mushy on the inside. But, I guess the name of the place boasts what they do best and that doesn't include fries.   The burger and shake were really good. I actually wanted a cookies and cream shake but it was only available on the \"bam-boozled shakes\" menu so I settled on a banana split shake ($9). Most times, these taste like either banana or strawberry or chocolate shakes. Holsteins did a nice job actually combining the flavors in the thick and creamy shake. There were pieces of banana in the shake, chocolate was drizzled in the glass, and the strawberry flavor came through in the shake as well. It was all topped with whipped cream, candy confetti, and a cherry. They also brought me the \"extra\" shake in the mixing cup...awesome!  I sat at the bar and service was efficient and very pleasant. They checked on me multiple times to ensure that I had everything that I needed and that the food was to my liking. This was a pricey burger, fries, and shake but it was worth it.",

    "text": "OMG!!!! This place was amazing and the next time I come to Vegas I am coming back for dinner because I want more than just a milkshake.   I saw this place on a Pinterest post and I knew I had to have a milkshake so when my husband and I were ready for a snack we came here. I had no idea that the milkshake would not be a snack but would be a full meal but it was great because then we didn't need to get dinner later in the evening.   We were able to be seated right away because we opted to sit at the bar and our wait staff/bar tender was very attentive and we had some great conversations.   We both got Bam-Boozled milkshakes. Mine was the Cookies N' Cream and Adam got a vanilla with whipped cream vodka. Our milkshakes came out very quickly and we were able to quickly start enjoying them. They both had the main glass and then the second cup with the rest of the milkshake. Holy cow were these delicious milkshakes. They had just the right amount of vodka in them that you knew it was there but it was super easy to chug as much as possible in one time. My milkshake also came with a full ice cream sandwich! I was in serious heaven. My review can't even do it justice, you honestly just have to go and get one for yourself. They are so yummy and fun and you can totally get a great insta pic with them.   The milkshakes were soooo big. Like I said, we thought they would be snack but they filled us up for the rest of the day. Since they were so large there was no way we were able to finish them but we were able to get a to go cup with the rest of the milkshake so we were able to have it while we walked around if we wanted and since we had a fridge in our room, we actually placed them in there and had them later in the evening.   Overall, I am so happy we came and I totally want to come back. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because we only had a milkshake and for me to give 5 stars everything has to be amazing so I plan to come back and get different items on the menu so I can update my review with 5 stars!!!",

Forgot how many of us there were, but they were able to accommodate for such a large group.   The shakes are a must if you go here, but don't be like me and get over excited, only to forget you have peanut allergies to the shakes.   The burgers in a sense were all pretty good in their unique way, i did quite enjoy it, but Bachi Burger does it better for bout as much as you'd pay here IMO. Maybe that's just me. But again, this place is hyped for the experience just to check off that I've been here.  Although, I do approve of the appetizer I had. Forgot what it's called though.

I felt as if I had bitten into a burger that was made by Jesus himself. I felt my taste buds celebrating. They were bursting in tears of joy because I have given them food that has given them a life they have never tasted before. If you are in Vegas, you better come to this place. I guarantee you, it will not be a disappointment.   Back to the al pastor burger. PERFECTO. Also a Great addition to this burger is jalapenos if you want a little extra kick! $1 dollar extra btw. 100% recommend this one if you are a huge al pastor fan like myself.   Top notch service, great food, and awesome Atmosphere. I cannot wait to come back. I'm buying 4 burgers to myself. YEEEEEHOOO",

    "text": "In my opinion these burgers are very expensive and not that great. I had better tasting burgers from yard house for half the price! Oh and for 7 more dollars you get fries or onion rings.   Our first time here was quite annoying. The hostess had a little snotty attitude. We stood there waiting for her while she was taking orders on the phone what seems to be like a couple minutes. There was another customer waiting after us. It would've been helpful if she would just gave us eye contact and nod her head letting us know she is aware of our presence. We felt ignored and our patience was running thin. After hanging up the phone she looks a little flustered. My bf asked if they have any Modelos at the bar. She gave him the \"what?\" Face . Her answer was \"I don't know\". Well,go to the bartender and ask! She just stood there. We were a little dumbfounded. By now my bf got really impatient. He asked her if she can go ask the bartender if they have those beer. She hesitated. She came back with a \"no we don't have that beer\". No apology no nothing. I could see my bf was getting very annoyed. We were hungry after a night of drinking and we needed to eat so we decided to eat here anyway. The waitress were wonderful. We were very please with her service. The extra star is for the waitress btw. I wish I knew her name. 2 burgers and fries 2 beer $70. Welcome to Vegas",

I ended up ordering one of their Crazy Bird chicken burgers, which was good but not exactly unforgettable. We tried their sweet potato fries and onion rings which were decent but again, not wowing. The price of the burgers is quite a bit more than you will pay at say Smasburger, without any extra wow factor.   I don't see myself returning with so many other food options in Las Vegas.",

Shakes: Good Ambience: Good Prices: Good (reasonable for being on the Strip)  Since both our shakes were super sweet, we ordered some fries to balance us off. Those were decent.  I'll definitely come back to try their burgers!",

I ordered their classic burger and it is definitely worth its price point. The burgers range from ~$14-45 but their milkshakes are a must have especially if you have a sweet tooth. We ordered an Oreo milkshake and it was the best milkshake I had ever had, it was packed with Oreos yet still didn't overwhelm the flavor of the milkshake itself. Don't underestimate the milkshakes as they are pretty big!",

Add shot of vodka is just $3 heyyyyy ;)  They look awesome!  Darn milkshakes make you wanna play balloon darts or watergun racing.  The cookies and cream comes with an ice cream cookie sandwich.  That right there is already worth part of the cost.  The fat boy has peanut butter cups and is straight up sugared out!  Hang onto your utters if you're tryna bounce around sugar highed.  Great service from our waiter Dean.  We swore another guy server was his brother.  Dean was cool checking on us.  Menu is fancy burger and fried stuff.  Onion rings order $10.  I think it's the whole onion too.  If I had the appetite, I would've finished it.  Totally food for kickin' it with time to waste.",

We were seated promptly in the bar.  Our server was friendly, patient (we were slow deciding) and efficient.  I don't remember the names of my wife's and my alcohol-containing shakes - hers was chocolate mint flavored and mine was chocolate themed.  Both came with a thick layer of cream on the rims studded with chocolate mint or chocolate chips, whipped cream and lots of treats on top.  Mine had a delicious brownie and a Hershey's chocolate bar.  You also get a stainless steel shake mixing cup with several ounces of additional shake.  Another friends regular chocolate shake was equally excellent.  I would definitely go back (but, alas, I was only in LV for two nights.)  It is well worth a visit - as is the Cosmopolitan Hotel in general.",

We had a party of 7, so we put our names on the waitlist. 3 of us weren't too hungry, so they decided to wait in the super long line to get in to the club. The rest of us 4 only waited about 30 minutes before we were seated.   I ordered the Gold Standard--a beef sirloin burger with bacon, goat cheddar, tomato, arugula, and garlic aioli. The burger was pretty good, and it was EXTREMELY filling. I couldn't finish it! The fries that came with the entree were also bomb! I also ordered a Campfire S'mores milkshake; to be honest, I thought the shake tasted better than the burger. On top of that, the shake was infused with some alcohol, so great if you're looking for a dangerous turn-up desse  Our server, Dean, was extremely hospitable and accommodating. Our group had to temporarily leave the restaurant because we wanted to needed to get into Marquee before a certain time if we wanted to get in for free. We got the call to get in line for Marquee right when our food arrived, so imagine how chaotic we were figuring out what to do. Dean was extremely understanding and made sure our table of food was not cleaned up, so props to him for demonstrating great service to a bunch of drunk kids! We made it back to our table to continue eating 15 minutes later...",

There are a variety of excellent burgers, both simple and complex.  The fries are wonderful, and the onion rings may be the best I've ever had.  And the shakes -- I basically have no words -- they are HUGE, complex, wonderfully unique combinations, with new ones added regularly; all of which have _real_ whipped cream and no detail overlooked.  Despite the price, I look forward to returning.  (This is probably now one of my regular stops whenever I'm in Las Vegas!  YUM!!)",

We showed up about 30 minutes after they opened on a Saturday and there was no wait which was great. Our server was friendly and the food came out fairly quickly. If you haven't worked up an appetite, I'd highly recommend sharing. The spiked shakes are whimsical, delicious, and just over the top. I loved the cookies n' cream shake; you can't really taste any of the booze in it so don't expect it to give you a buzz or anything. I also tried their turkey burger which was flavorful and it comes with a great thousand island-ish sauce which is perfect for dipping your fries in (ask for it on the side!).  Our table also shared the truffle mac n' cheese which is a good portion for one person if you're craving something cheesy and aren't feeling burgers. Mac n' cheese was pretty good too but I couldn't appreciate it since I was stuffed with fries, a creamy milkshake, and bites of the giant ice cream sandwich on top of the shake.   I also like the casual vibes of the place-- great spot to just have a chill meal with your group. Don't be surprised if your dress for the cluuuurb later that night seems to be a bit snug :)",

Let me just preface that it was absolutely not busy/packed by any means so I'm not sure what was going on.  We ended up ordered, got our shakes (which were delicious by the way) and got our burgers a bit after. The BF had the onion rings and I had fries (which were cold and I had to ask for a fresh order because they were definitely stale).   We didn't have a lengthy meal (it was lunch time) and I didn't think we were being annoying by any means with what we ordered, refills, etc.  but it felt like we had quite a long lunch   The burgers themselves were quite good but with the time, service and price tag for it all, I'd say that it's just \"OK\".    $66 before tip for 2 burgers, 2 shakes, onion rings and fries.",

I would come back to try some of the other burgers on the menu.  Service: I sat at the bar and the bartender provided excellent service.

Sat there for about fifteen minutes and no one paid us any attention.  I'm definitely coming back every time I go to Vegas. I wish they had a location near me.

    "text": "How Long Does It Take?  On a weekend trip to Las Vegas, we decided to stop by to get our fill of some burgers. We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday afternoon and were told that a table of 3 would have a waiting period of approximately 30 minutes. They would take down our phone number, we would leave and actually get called back within 10 minutes. This is starting out to be a good experience, but.....  Our orders were taken fairly quickly and we were eager to begin our meal. After about 45 minutes of waiting, we started to get restless. Not only were we starving, but we had not heard from our waitress. We flagged her down and inquired about our order. When she returned, she said she wasn't sure why it was taking so long, so she offered us some cheese popcorn.   We inhaled the 1st round of popcorn and a 2nd round was offered since our food was still being prepared. Our hunger for food continued to mount and with still no food in sight, our waitress offered to give us some steak fries. Again, another 2 rounds of fries came out and after an hour of waiting for our food, we finally received our order.   Ahi Sliders, Korean \"Bull\" GoGi and the Rising sun were ordered. The Ahi sliders were served between 2 buns that appeared to have been chilled. I don't know about most, but cold bread to me is not edible. Both the Korean \"Bull\" GoGi and Rising Sun burgers were overly charred on the outside to the point that they had this burnt taste to them (both were ordered to be cooked Medium). This was quite disappointing and most of the meal was not even finished.   After our meal, the waitress comes over and asks why we didn't finish the ahi sliders because she notices that most people don't. I am thinking Really?!? We told her the buns were a bit cold and it didn't go well with the ahi. She went on and asked how did we enjoy the burgers and we told her about the burnt taste. She said that's what Holstein's prides itself in cooking their burgers and that some customers like the charred taste on their burgers. I don't know where these customers reside from, but they should understand that burnt/charred food is unhealthy. I do give her credit as she did whatever she could to keep our spirits up throughout the meal and tried to keep our dining experience a positive one, but....  When we were settling the bill, we wanted to use our Groupon to be applied to the bill. This was a headache as the fries from earlier that were supposed to have been comped by our waitress were included on the bill. Trying to apply the Groupon just confused the manager/waitress even more. Overall, the dining experience did not live up to our expectations. I'd rather roll over to Burger Bar next time.",

Loved the funky feel of the decor it stood amongst the rest of the trendy burger place popped up all over Vegas lately.   For starters we got the chicken buffalo dip (must try!), the lobster mac n cheese (I'm not much a seafood person and I still enjoyed it), and the fried pickles (who doesn't like fried pickles). The GM (Sergio) came over and greeted us and was very helpful giving his suggestions as to what to order. For entrees the other 3 in the group all ordered the \"rising sun\" and per Sergio's suggestion my hubby added a fried egg. I went against the stream and ordered the \"korean bullgogi\". All of us were speachless when the food arrived and all agreed it would be awhile before we could ever eat a burger from anywhere else cause we didnt want to tarnish the taste of these burgers!  Before heading out my girlfriend and I ordered some of the adult shakes to go. She got the grasshopper and I ordered the guava float. Both again were well worth the cost of $11 (really a steal considering you'll pay about $15 for a red bull/ vodka at a casino floor bar).   Yes the prices may be a bit much for burgers but really wasn't isn't pricey about Vegas anymore! And for the freshness and quality you get at Holsteins its well worth every penny. This will be one of my must return to spots for future Vegas trips, even if just a stop at the bar to grab another shake.",

Burgers are good, however, there is nothing that sets them apart from other high end burger joints in Vegas, from Burger Bar, Le Burger to burGR.",

Do not put ketchup on this burger!!! When they delivered my burger they gave me the great advice of not adding ketchup until I tried a bite. So glad they told me that because it was so delicious without it.  I really can't tell you much about the fries. I think I liked them, but I was so into my burger that I couldn't tell you much about them. I actually ordered a Martini to go with this steak burger and it couldn't have been more fitting.   The service was great. I decided to sit up at the bar since I was rolling solo. Eating an amazing burger, sipping on a Martini and reading Steve Jobs biography. My most mellow dinner in Vegas ever! Enjoyed every bit of it.   I will make sure next time I am in Vegas I visit and bring my friends for the best burger I have had in quite some time.",

The cartoon cow graces their windows and in the wall paintings, which creates a fun and relaxed environment.  They have interesting gourmet burgers and sliders and spiked milkshakes!    My favorite was the Rising Sun burger - kobe beef with tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, and sprinkles of furikake.  So many different flavors and textures that worked together.  I also tried the Fun-ghi, with portabello mushrooms, aioli, and truffle oil, but it was too much goodness in one that it was overwhelming.  The flavors were too similar and heavy, especially the two thick pieces of gruyere cheese.  The burgers come with a side of either skinny or steak fries.  I recommend the steak fries because their skinny fries are too crispy and almost chip-like.    Don't forget to try their shakes and malts!  I wanted to try their spiked shakes, but got grossed out thinking about alcohol from the night before, so I got a simple vanilla malt, which was thick, creamy and fatty.  YUM!",

I have tried the shakes & I know some of you might think dairy and alcohol won't mix or anticipate a trip to the bathroom but it's hellllla good, & you can add extra shots, it does creep up on ya! Don't knock it til' you try it! I have tried the red velvet & the smore's shakes, both were good but I prefer the smores! I did appreciate the waitress we had, I wish I got her name.. my family came deep (we're loud by the way) and when more family showed up they easily accommodated them and did not give us a hard time at all about it!

    "text": "I was skeptical in trying Holsteins because of the mixed reviews, but after eating at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR so much, I wanted a different burger place. Originally we came here around midnight Fri to try the place, but were told they stopped serving their regular menu at 11PM. They offered a late night menu instead which were basically just appetizers (no burgers/shakes). No biggie, we came back the next day after a fabulous time at Marquee's dayclub...Spoiler alert: We also came back the next day before we left on the drive back home because it was SOOO GOOD!!  The decor is so cute here w/ the anime pig wall posters and the theme totally matched w/ the Cosmopolitan. Our server made great recommendations for us & started us off w/ the complimentary small bucket of lightly salt/sweet popcorn.   Bamboozled Shakes: Drunken Monkey - I added toasted coconut marshmallow to it and this was one damn good shake! The description/ingredients seemed so minimal, yet the shake tasted so amazing. It was like a cookies n cream reese's coconut shake. This was my fav out of all the other shakes.   Tiramisu - They had me at mascarpone ice cream. I LOVE mascarpone, but you could barely taste it in this shake. This tasted like a chocolate shake, not much espresso/coffee flavor.   Banana Creme Pie -  I would say this was my 2nd fav shake. It tastes exactly like a banana cream pie, but in shake form w/ chocolate. I liked that they topped it w/ white chocolate covered bananas.  The shakes are big enough to share, but trust me you won't want to. I like that you get a full glass shake and the extras are in the metal mixing cup so you can eat it w/ a spoon (yum!) I also like that their shakes all were thick & creamy!  Apps: Surf 'n Turf Quesadilla - DELISH my favorite app! This ain't no taco bell quesadilla. It was crunchy and not oily at all. The lobster, steak and manchego cheese inside all just melted in your mouth and is bursting w/ flavor. MUST ORDER!!  Soft Shell Crab Bruschetta - For a burger place, their presentation of these apps were tapas style and as nice as any fancy steakhouse. The softshell crab was on top of a thick cut brioche bread, the aioli and tomato salad made the app refreshing  Crispy Calamari - big enough portion to share, I couldn't stop dunking these rings in the sweet chili sauce. I like that they don't overbread the calamari rings  Maine lobster roll - pricey for this, but there were generous amount of lobster.   Crispy pork belly bun - Tasted better than the ones at Ramsay's BurGR. The steamed buns weren't dry & sauce was spot on  Burgers: Rising Sun w/ onion rings(normally comes w/ fries, but paid $2 to upgrade) - THE BEST BURGER EVER!! Most asian fusion burgers get overpowered by the sauce, but not here. It didn't taste like an ordinary overly sweet typical terriyaki burger. Everything was perfect about this burger, that first bite was so orgasmic. THIS IS what a burger should taste like! The whole brioche bun was toasted to perfection. I am not sure how they did it, but the top part of the bun and inside had a nice toast crisp to it. The tempura avocado was nice, added a different texture. You could taste each item in the burger and they all blended well together. The KOBE beef patty was cooked medium, yet it was juicy and had a nice pink to it. Onion rings were the best we've had as well & worth the upgrade! They were thick, fried, fresh, and crispy, no soggy oiliness at all. MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR BUTTERMILK RANCH TO DIP THE ONION RINGS IN!! It tastes so divine  Fun-Ghi on WHEAT BUN w/ salad ($2 extra) - Healthy combo huh? My 2nd fav burger, but my friend preferred this over Rising sun because she prefers the truffle flavor. Again, patty was cooked perfect along w/ toasted wheat bun. I actually prefer the regular bun's flavor although the wheat bun was toasted the same way as the regular brioche bun. The burger wasn't smothered in mayo thank god! The gruyere helped accentuate the truffle portabella & caramelized onions. Salad was a generous portion of mixed greens & the dressing was tangy yet sweet & light (sort of like a coleslaw dressing w/ lemon). The only negative is that we added a fried egg to the burger, but there was no runny yolk...the egg was fully cooked :(  Gold Standard w/ sweet potato fries- Everyone kept talkin about this burger, but we thought it paled in comparison to Rising Sun. Sweet potato fries were bomb!  I would have to say that Holstein's outranks Ramsay's BurGR. We were so pleased w/ our meal that we sent compliments to the chef. We were lucky that both days we ate here, the executive chef was working. The food comes out fast and you will leave happily stuffed. Don't forget to give them your identity player's card for points!  Note: Try and get a girl server. The first day we had a girl and she was totally on top of it. The 2nd day, we had a guy and he seemed easily overwhelmed",

Only reason it's getting 4 instead of 5 is because they over-cooked a burger but remade it and took it off the bill.   THe ambiance is classy and elegant, just what you'd expect from a high end Vegas burger place, kinda reminded me of BUrGR by Gordan Ramsey.  We ordered the truffled lobster mac and cheese and the bulgogi quesadilla for appatizers. Both were yelp recommended and both were spot on. Highly highly recommend!   For dinner I ordered the Longhorn burger which was topped with brisket and pickles. Did not disappoint. Burger was cooked perfect and the brisket was super juicy and delicious. Also highly recommend!   We also ordered the cheesecake with caramel and that was rich and wonderful!   Wether you're staying at the Cosmo or not, I highly recommend stopping by Holsteins for a burger and a shake!",

They were bite size. Then we had the Fun-ghi burger. I was a little bummed that they over cooked it. I ordered it medium rare and it was a solid medium well. The flavors were delicious. I added goat cheese which made it even more amazing. Definitely would give it a second try on my next fist to Las Vegas!",

Located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it's a good place to get burgers, fries, shakes or that stick to your gut feeling food.  We ordered buffalo wings ( nice), green salad ( basic, but good), California Turkey burger ( turkey patty, well flavored, avocado, sprouts, lettuce, onions, I said hold the secret sauce). My husband got the classic which basically is a big burger, he said it was good. Our daughters got the sliders and fries, they said they were very good, and shakes ( vanilla for the little, chocolate for the older ) and they said they were thick, sweet and delightful.  Staff was friendly, fast with service and attentive. Decor is like urban graffiti farm, clean and well maintained. For a \"burger place\" it's definitely more on the pricey side,the bill was around $120, but like I said, it's like \"let's all us a gourmet burger place\" in the Cosmo, so you're going to pay more.",

Everyone that had food enjoyed every morsel of their food :)  Lobster mac & cheese was amazing too!!  Some guy came by and gave us liquid nitrogen frozen mints afterwards which was soooo cool!!!  Edit: so we came back the today to have dinner AGAIN because it was so good yesterday. I had the \"rising sun\" burger with jalapenos (per recommendation of waiter Justin) and it was awesome. Considering the size of the burger, it was very light on your palate. The teriyaki sauce adds the perfect touch to the tempura avocado.   Also, customer service is great. We had Justin as our server twice in a row and he totally remembered us, down to the drinks we ordered last night.   Definitely stop by if you're in Vegas!!!",

One of my favorite places to get some food in Vegas.  The service is a little below average, which is the only thing preventing them from receiving 5 stars. The server just seemed disinterested in serving not only us, but everyone around us.  The food, on the other hand, is delish!  Nom Nom Burger ($17.50) Chips inside a burger just reminds me of my childhood days when I used to do that with french fries. Throw in a fried egg for another dollar or two and this burger is golden. I get my burger medium-rare, and I'm in heaven when I'm devouring the Nom Nom.  Vanilla Milkshake ($9) A little pricey, but you can share a milkshake with someone else. They give you a glass filled with the milkshake, and they give you the rest in a stainless steel cup, so it's like TWO millshakes. I don't like whip, so it's all milkshake and nothing else for me.  I try to come here every time I'm at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Nice place to get some food and even catch the game. And if you're really feeling a game, the sports bet is right across from Holstein's!",

They always have complimentary popcorn with a different flavor of the month, this time it was pizza flavored and it was also great,  I usually have onion rings with my burger and can never finish all the food because the portions are over sized....If you're in vegas do urself and taste buds a favor and go to this place!

I've had the drunken monkey shake and the birthday cake shake and they are both really good.   For appetizers I've had the buffalo chicken dip and the surf and turf quesadilla. But on my last visit the surf and turf quesadilla was no longer on the menu. The lobster mac and cheese is really good too.   My favorite burger here is the Rising Sun. It's so good and topped with teriyaki sauce, crispy sweet potato strings and tempura avocado. The flavors come together nicely. I've also tried the Captain Hook sandwich which is salmon with a remoulade sauce and that is really good too. Both the fries and onion rings here are good.   Good atmosphere and great food. Service can be a little slow but they are always busy so it's understandable.",

It took about 15 minutes to get our waters. I ordered the ahi poke tostadas as an appetizer. There was an overwhelming taste of lime and cilantro that took over each bite and they were served on stale chips. For my entree, I got the El Machete burger. It was honestly just okay... The bottom bun was a bit soggy which made it difficult to eat with my hands without everything falling out of the burger. The best part of my experience was the fries (which were pretty good, I'll give them that). We were all pretty fed up and wanted to leave rather quickly. then it took a while to get our check which I couldn't understand because I looked around the restaurant and the place wasn't even half full. The most annoying part was that they included gratuity in our bill already (for our party of 6) so we couldnt give them the tip that we felt they actually deserved because they already charged us for it.",

My buddy had the regular burger and raved that is was the tastiest he's had and I had the lobster sandwich which was also quite tasty. Everything is presented well and taste is big!  Desserts are creative too. I grabbed the Coffee and Donuts which sounds awfully normal. However, it was presented on a platter as a chocolate infused coffee with marshmallows served with gourmet donut holes filled with different flavored pastry cremes (like cardamom and cinnamon). SUPER tasty.  Great joint, great MUSIC too. They must have a resident DJ who does some creative transitions between classic 80s.  Definitely going back!",

Most recently we had a major service issue where seconds after the bartender, who immediately apologized, spilled an entire beer on our friend the individual simultaneously seating us announced into their headset that the party of 5 was now a party of 3, and switched our table. Instead of being seated at a table set for five with plenty of room we were placed at a cramped set of two tables for two with a spare chair assigned for the fifth individual. Most distressing was that she readily admitted this, told us that we would not be given the originally designated table and did it directly in front of us, and apparently because their staff spilled an drink on one of our party. This reeks of insufficient, inadequate, or uncaring trading and goes beyond the pale. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the food is quite good. The service needs severe revision.",

    "text": "So a few girlfriends and I came here after a few hours at Marquee's Day Club pool party on 4th of July weekend. Our hunger was ridiculous since we were being smart and didnt eat breakfast prior to going to the pool.   Our main motivation to go was because it was close, and because after a night of bottle service, we were all craving GREASY food (i.e., burgers and fries).   Upon being seated - we were given a bucket of popcorn with truffle salt on it \"compliments of the chef\". OH PUH-LEATHE!!! everyone gets em... it's like bread at other restaurants, only here its truffle popcorn. hahah. however, never having had \"truffle\" anything before - it was good. but i was also HELLA HUNGRY. so you coulda given me stale popcorn and i would probably still enjoyed it.  Two of us werent feeling adventurous and just ordered the regular burger and shoestring fries. I ordered provolone cheese on my burger, she ordered cheddar - but when the burgers came out, BOTH had a white cheese on em. I'm pretty sure BOTH were provolone, bc last i checked, cheddar cheese is orange and nowhere on the menu did it state \"white cheddar\". anyways, whatever, she let it go cuz we were starving. I have to say, though, the meat was really good and you can tell it was \"real meat\" - i mean it was ground beef, but still chunky... if that makes sense. anyways. the burgers are pretty big - served as 2 meals for me (i saved half for dinner) and i love super skinny crunchy shoestring fries. Overall - the burger was a burger nonetheless, and maybe it's my fault for not being adventurous and getting one of those special burgers, but i was too hungry to risk ordering something i wouldnt like. Nothing really to write home about other than the meat was of better quality than other burgers i've had. it's really hard to mess up a burger.  Another item my party ordered was the lobster mac and cheese. I only had a few bites but it was DELISH. however, for the price of the dish, i would have expected a slightly larger serving than what they gave.   As for service - it could have been better. the girl only came by 4 times. once to take drink orders, once for our real order, once to check up on us, and once to give us our check. mind you, checking up on us once may be okay for some, but i hate \"hunting\" waiters/waitresses down for refills. im a person who largely bases tips on refills because not having to ask for a refill to get one means that the waiter is being attentive and paying attention to you and your party. but maybe thats just me...",

    "text": "Rising Sun burger with fried egg. Medium rare melt in your mouth Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, tempura fried avocado, etc.... A combination made in burger heaven.  10 stars Onion rings. Thick onions with crispy batter.  Oh yeaaa.  5 stars Strawberry milkshake = expensive but so good.  I could drink at least 2 or 3 of these in one sitting if they weren't $10+ per shake!  5 stars Bull-gogi burger. 4 stars. Other burgers. 2-3 stars. Duck fat fries, sweet potato fries and regular fries = mehhhhh.  Limp and sad.  2 stars  I love the Cosmopolitan and would already stay here because of the beautiful rooms but the fact that the Rising Sun burger is served downstairs gives me more of a reason to return to this hotel when I visit Vegas.  When it comes to \"fancy\" burgers, I normally prefer a good ol' backyard bbq style burger or InNOut over the Umami style fancy pants type burgers.  However the Rising Sun might just give that backyard style burger a run for its money.  Take away all the clubs, the glitz & glamour and unique entertainment on the Strip and I'd still return to Vegas just to eat this burger again.  Holstein's fries and other burgers are mediocre/ok (with the exception of the Korean style one which was good too) so I would only come here for the shakes and Rising Sun.  I make it a point to eat here every time I'm in town.  Great place to stop by before clubbing at Marquee, which is right in front of Holstein's.  There's usually about a 15 minute wait for a table but you can also grab a table in the bar area which is first-come first serve.  Oh and another plus- Rising Sun doesn't have any onions in it so if you are planning on clubbing and working your game on some hottie in the club later in the night, you won't have to worry about having stinky onion breath. ;)",

We started with the fried pickle appetizer  - good breaded crunchy coating and equally crunchy dill pickle spears within. A few fried olives in the mix didn't hurt one bit. Hubby ordered the Korean Bull-Gogi burger loaded with a nice soy/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a fried egg atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. This burger was a nice size and had a good side of sweet potato fries with it. I had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. Great flavor on both entrees. Plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. Mine was the Oreo cookie with Bailey's and hubby had the S'mores with rum. Goodness gracious, set me up with another! Food was pretty reasonably priced for pricey Vegas as well. Try it!",

You also have to take into consideration that you are not at home this is vegas and the space is at a premium causing the business to have to charge more to cover that expense.   Our server Erin was fantastic. This girl never stopped moving and I never saw anyone in her area including us sit with an empty glass. I drink a lot of diet coke and she kept them coming I never had to even ask. She was very friendly, perceptive and just a great person to talk with. Even had the food been fair the service would have Moore then made up for it.   The food was very good. We had the hen burger and the longhorn burgers. We cut them in half and each took a half of each. They were both good burgers. We both preferred the hen not to say the other was bad it just didn't seem to have the flavor we liked that the hen did. We also ordered the onion rings and they were great. The sauce was a bit smokey for me but my wife loved it. They came out nice and crisp and the onions were actually cooked.  We will go back.",

I'm broken without it. I can't... I can't handle being away from it...  /end dramatic cold open.  Seriously, as someone who's eaten well over 100 unique burgers, this is in my top 3. EVER. And it's not just because my friend and I walked in piss drunk. We weren't really -that- drunk, but very hungry, nonetheless.  We shared a spiked Cap'n Crunch milkshake which I thought was the greatest thing ever. I'm onto these places starting to get all hip with their cereal malts. I'm down with it.  I had the Fun-Ghi burger and... okay, wait... I need to breathe. Okay, I'm good. I think. BE STILL, MY BEATING HEART. Jesus Christ. Okay, I'm back.  I was just flabbergasted at how well-prepared and tasty every single bite of this burger was. There's just nothing more I can say about it. Every single ingredient was prepared well and all the flavors complemented each other and there were just perfect amounts of everything and was just really satisfying to eat.  The fries were also very good. I personally thought, that, for the price and in a place like this on the strip, it was a good deal. You can easily be paying $20+ for a crappier meal on the strip.  I also liked the atmosphere and all the artwork they have hanging around, and our waiter was AWESOME. He got a large tip. He knew he what he was doing, though. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and quick - we were out of there in under an hour, around DINNER TIME. It was seriously one of the most pleasant meals I've had in my entire life, and since I've been here I've contemplated going back to Vegas just for a night or two and eating here. I swear by it. Eat here. Please.",

So there you have it, two people who don't eat burgers in an establishment that serves primarily burgers.  So why did I rate it so highly? The shakes. Actually they're called bam-boozled shakes because they have alcohol. How can you see a TIRAMISU shake on a menu and NOT order it? It was like someone blended up a really good tiramisu with some ice cream. I could slightly taste the alcohol, which was perfect for the shake.  The decor is also pretty fun. There are graffitied mascots all over the walls that make it feel like a fun and vibrant place to have lunch. My only issue is with the crazy outfits for the waitresses in the bar area. I know it's Vegas and all, but the Hooters shorts don't really go with anything else there.  The food was not as good, but still reasonable. I got some crazy Kung Pao Tamale. It sounded really good, and was presented quite well. I thought the first few bites were great, but then it got tedious (and mind you it was a small dish). There was too much salt/MSG and the sauce was too sweet. Together they made for a lot of flavor at first, but just got difficult to eat after a few bites. So I'm giving it some credit because it was flavorful. I'm not sure if it was a trial dish because I don't think they're offering it anymore. My wife got the veggie burger, which was okay.  Still, I will be going again next time I'm in Vegas just for some fries and a shake!",

The restaurant was not accepting open table reservations for the day we were wanting to go.   We entered the restaurant and the bar area was packed, but the dining room was fairly empty. The hostess said there was a 40 minute wait for a party of two. I respectfully declined the wait for a table and proceeded to look for bar seating. It appeared to be full, but then noticed an empty table near the dj booth at the second entry. It took a few minutes for a waitress to get to us but wasn't too excessive of a wait. I asked to be moved to one of the many empty four tops in the dining room, but the waitress said that we couldn't move to one of the open tables and it needed to be setup with the hostess. I think this was a crowd control tactic, but who knows.. Food came out fairly quick, we got the rising sun and turkey burger, both were pretty good and reasonably priced. Fries were included and were a tad bit too greasy. Drinks were reasonably priced, around $12-15 each. I'd probably go back if I'm back and could get a reservation. I would have given the restaurant 4 stars, but the wait and attitude of the restaurant brings it down a star.",

    "text": "I ordered the blackened salmon po' boy, which ended up being a mistake. I should have ordered a burger. My wife did and it looked delicious. The po' boy was unfortunately dry and extremely messy. The fries that accompanied it were OK. I'm not a fan of steak fries due to their sogginess. Instead, I prefer crispier, thinner fries. I  wish there had been a second option. But, if you are a fan of soggier fries, you will probably like these.  The service was actually quite good. I was drinking water like crazy, and my glass was always refilled promptly before I could even ask. My only regret is that I did not take the waiter's recommendations, since my meal was somewhat lackluster.  I'd give this place another chance. My bad for trying to opt for something healthier at a burger joint, I suppose.   Also, being next to the entrance to Marquee, this place can get pretty loud. So, if loud crowds bother you, you should be aware for that.",

Decent beer selection (maybe good for Vegas standards).  I order the nom nom burger with a fried egg. It was delicious. Great beef flavor, some crunch (although mostly soggy) from the kettle-like chips, an egg i could taste (I usually can't, besides the royal red robin burger), and a bold/sharp slice of cheddar. Overall, I liked the taste and flavor of everything that went into the nom nom and more importantly, I like that I could taste each part of it. I feel a lot of higher-end burger places have too much going on and it all falls apart. Not the case at Holsteins.  My girlfriend ordered the fun-ghi which from the bite I tried, was excellent as well. Great mushroom flavors.  I liked this place and it's among my top higher end burger spots.",

I came with a my Vegas local friend to grab a bite before watching our show Zarkana and decided to eat here since it wasn't too far from the Aria. Like all the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan are trendy just like the hotel, the music was loud and the decor around the restaurant was fun to look at especially the Holstein's Bull right across from the bar.   I ordered the Captain Hook that had raw and grilled salmon all on one burger and I thought was very unique and my friend ordered the Rising Sun Burger that included Kobe beef and tempura avocado. We both shared each others burgers to get a taste and we loved it but it was pricey just like everything  else inside the Cosmopolitan but who cares if you just want to relax with friends and family and have a great time. Our meals included strong fries and for the appetizer we got the lobster quesadilla and complimentary popcorn.  Service here was excellent and I'll definitely be back to try other burgers on the menu.",

The server came over and took our drink orders and told us the specials right away.  To start we ordered the pork sliders and pork belly buns.. Someone loves pork!  They were both pretty good.  The pork sliders had an Asian twist with cilantro and peanut sauce.  It was a good combination.  The pork belly buns were good and tasty, but a little too fatty for my tasting.  I took a bite and it was all fat. No meat at all.  It was seasoned well, but I didn't like the fat texture.  Overall the appetizers were good.  We also ordered amazing onion rings that were stacked really high.  They were so crispy and so good.   I ordered the rising sun burger cooked medium.  It was delicious and I think I could've eaten it all myself, but I shared it.  It came with steak fried which were thick but crispy.    Other people ordered a salad which looked good, but didn't taste good.  (But who orders a salad at a burger joint?) It was a waste if money because it costs doubled for the salad compared to my burger.  I'm sure they will never order a salad at a burger joint ever again.   Service was good and they gave us popcorn as he delivered everyone water.  I wanted to ask when the movie started.  The popcorn was good.    Some people in my group didn't like it, but i didn't order a salad at a burger joint so I really liked my burger.  Will definitely go back to try a shake with my burger.",

Loud music, cute staff, fun artwork, big, diverse menu, but slightly overpriced.  We came for lunch on a Saturday. There was about a 25 min wait, but given that it is a popular place, we expected that. We each ended up getting cocktails (not the milkshakes). My friend loved her Bloody Mary, and I thought that the XXX was fine, nothing to rave over. Drinks ranged from $10-$13.   We split the lobster mac & cheese (I believe it was $16). It was a pretty small portion, and I found it to be underseasoned. You could see the lobster in there, so that was a good thing.   I had the Chicken Carbonnera sandwich, while she had the Gold Standard burger. We were both pleased. My chicken was juicy, I loved the bun and the egg on top, as well as the bacon.  We both liked the steak fries (you have a choice of shoestring or steak cut) as well. Portions were about average- not tiny, but you won't leave feeling like you're bursting out of your pants, either.  Service was fine, nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either.  Prices..well, for what you get, they may be a bit overpriced, but knowing that it is on the Strip, in the Cosmo...",

    "text": "This review will be based only on the burgers.   Since Christmas day basically consists of my mom and my boyfriend, we decided to spend some time walking on the strip and grab lunch at Holsteins.  I ordered the Crazy Bird ($16) which was OK - not terrible, but not something I'd order again either. It was a chicken breast burger with kettle chips (more like kettle crumbs), a pickled shallot (? .. it was something pink), lettuce, and tomato. In the description it listed garlic aioli which is why I leaned towards ordering that item, but I honestly really couldn't depict it in my bites.  Mi madre went with Captain Hook ($17) - a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, the pickled pink stuff, and smoked salmon. That was much more worth the money and if I ever paid a visit again, that's probably what I would order. The salmon wasn't dry and the smoked salmon actually complemented very will with the grilled salmon filet, giving the burger a strong salmon kick.  My boyfriend went with the Big Fat Greek ($17) - a burger basically with all the ingredients you'd find at a Greek restaurant like lamb, feta, lettuce, tomato, and tatziki. That was pretty tasty as well if you don't mind a hint of gaminess from the lamb. The boyfriend quite enjoyed it but said it didn't hit the spot like he hoped.  There were definitely other options I would've been keen on trying but the average pricing was $18 for all other types of burgers and I just don't care that much about burgers to spend close to $20. All comes with a small personal-sized bucket of fries or you could sub it for sweet potato fries or onion rings for an extra $2.  The bill came out to be $70 after taxes and tip... that's pretty rough in my opinion but I guess I shouldn't expect any less from restaurants on the Strip.   Would I come here again? Sure if my out-of-town friends dragged me. As for the shakes, I think they are definitely worth a try since some of the concoctions are pretty interesting and unique (not to mention it also includes liquor) if you don't mind spending the extra $13. As for me, a non-drinker, I'll just stick to off-strip joints for any burger cravings...",

I left my number with her and decided to just wait there as well. After 25 mins, I decided to go up to the host stand and ask how much longer seeing people after us were being seated. The guy told me they put down the wrong number and that our table had been ready but didn't bother to walk 5 ft outside or ask for my name.  Service 3/5 - Service was okay. Although the waiter did recommend things to go with our burger when we were ordering, we rarely saw him. He came by to refill my water once and then back again when we needed the check. I understand it gets busy here but he seemed all over the place and the busboy ended up helping us more.  Food 5/5 - My bf got the Gold Standard and Coffee & Donuts shake while I got the Nom Nom Burger and Cookies & Cream shake. The burgers were cooked really well but I felt like the chips on my Nom Nom Burger tasted stale and just took them off. The fries that came with them were good but after that I was so full I could barely finish my shake. The shakes we got supposedly have alcohol in them but you don't taste any, however they did taste good for regular shakes.   The atmosphere was fun and modern with cartoon cows all over the place. There's also a bar if you wanted to grab drinks and I liked that they offer smaller tables near the front for drinks.   Overall, I would come back for the food and hope they work on their service.",

    "text": "I thought this place would be over hyped but I was pleasantly surprised!   The restaurant is located on the second floor of Cosmo, right across from Marquee entrance. It is pretty spacious inside with plenty of tables. We were seated immediately and the service was quick yet friendly.   They provide complimentary popcorn which was nice to munch on while we waited for our food to arrive. I shared a Rising Sun burger and a Tiramisu milkshake. Both were incredibly delicious!!! The burger came out just the way we wanted, but the restaurant doesn't cut the burger in half for you. It's a little inconvenient but I guess it makes sense since it would ruin the presentation of some burgers. We ordered the burger with a side of steak cut fries, which were basically potato wedges and not steak fries. Just a heads up for those steak fries lovers out there! The milkshake also tasted a lot like a tiramisu cake!! I would recommend splitting a shake since they are HUGE.   The menu items are a little pricey but it didn't seem to bad when I split a burger and a shake. The shake is really heavy so unless I plan on skipping a burger (which I would never do) I would definitely split it.",

The beef on both burgers was so delicious, and they were cooked perfectly to our liking. The fries are the. best. ever., and the onion rings were also great. Finished it off with the non alcoholic version of the Cookies and Cream shake - it literally has an entire ice cream sandwich on top of it!! With homemade chocolate chip cookies, and about an inch and a half of ice cream in the middle! We were so full, but we managed to polish all of it off, too. Well deserved 5 stars in our book, and we'll definitely be back.",

First round didn't go well at all....long wait for the table (1hr), long wait for the food (45min), long wait for the dessert (20min)....food was overcooked and not amazing. Crazy loud club like atmosphere. Was it a fluke? Everyone else seems to love this place!  So round two...Came in on a Tuesday night with a reservation...not needed. Sat down and ordered fairly quickly. Never received the comp popcorn. Got the food, perfectly cooked, but never checked on. Had to request for refills twice. I was given the bill WITHOUT being asked if we wanted dessert (we did)....not even sure if I got a thank you.    I asked the server for a milkshake recommendation, (they make all shakes virgin if requested), and was told about the twinkie cake. I presumed it was a twinkie shake, so when it came out, I sent it back and ordered something else...with her giving me attitude and wondering why there was a problem.  If I was rating off service alone, this time would have been a solid 1 star.  The Billionaire Burger : Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, and Truffle Mayo :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=iOZrBKX9_IEsZ1XM96Is-Q#iOZrBKX9_IEsZ1XM96Is-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  This was a great hamburger, with a nice and thick slice of foie gras! The onions added a nice consistency and taste, but I didn't really notice the truffle mayo. The burgers here were coming apart as well, and it didn't pack the punch I've had elsewhere in town, but good overall! I'd say it might be a #5-6 on my scale!  4 stars!  Finished with a shake...Drunken Monkey (Virgin) : Reese's, Banana, Malt and (Frangelico) :  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=iOZrBKX9_IEsZ1XM96Is-Q#l-ZlqgtrX8S_Fv23awrmZw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  Super good! Way better than the Oreo shake we had last time!  They also served us the extras with a little cup, so Little Foodie Dude could share with me!  Very thoughtful of them...Solid 4 stars!   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/holsteins-shakes-and-buns-las-vegas?select=iOZrBKX9_IEsZ1XM96Is-Q#iQ1ktxKe_pjjehy9ENGqrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hols...</a>  There ARE better burgers in town! But you can still have a great time at Holsteins...just hope you get a better server than I did!",

They gave us complementary popcorn to start off with, which had a little spice it was seasoned with. For my main entree, I had the golden standard medium done with a side of fries. First off this burger is one of the juiciest beefs and flavorful burgers I've ever had. The smoked bacon, aged goat cheese cheese, arugula, tomato and garlic-chive aioli were combined perfectly. It was big enough to have me full halfway through.  I'm such a fry person and there was just something about the crisp and freshness of the fry that made it another favorite of mine. Wish I tried their shake but this will definitely be on the list for my next visit.   Though on the pricier end it was definitely a dining experience to remember.",

If you want to add another shot -which I suggest- you have to tell them before because they cant add it after.

The strawberry shake was fantastic!! They gave a huge amount and even a left over cup with some extra. I was able to share the shake and it was plenty for the two of us. As for the burger I got one with chicken and it was outstanding!! The toppings and sauces were all a wonderful compliment.   Overall a great place to grab a bite to eat at the Cosmo. If you check in on Yelp they give you 50% off select draft beers which is a great perk! Also you get free popcorn with pizza seasoning instead of the typical bread most restaurants serve.",

We were still slightly hungover at dinner time and did not really want to venture very far so we decided to check out Holsteins.  Pretty cool that they have two openings, one with a host stand and the other used as an exit.  Definitely helps with the flow of traffic.  The four of us asked for a table and were seated immediately.  It's a bit loud and probably not a place you would want to go to if you're looking to have a meaningful conversation.  But to keep you entertained, you just need to look around and get a good laugh from awesome cartoons of cows and sexy pickles and sexy burger buns.  Checking into Yelp you get 50% off on all draft beers!  Making them about $5-6 each, probably one of the best deals you could get around the strip.  Just note that they require each person who is ordering beer to check in.  After placing our drink orders we were given a bucket of seasoned popcorn.  I've never seen popcorn be eaten so quickly before...  We placed out dinner orders and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The burgers were a decent size and come with a small bucket of fries.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  Weird thing though, the bathroom has the shallowest sink, about 1 inch deep and basically no space between the faucet and the sink basin.",

I subbed a Caesar Salad for fries for a $3 upcharge which I though was kind of unfair until I saw that this was no skimpy Caesar Salad and was actually quite good as was my burger.",

The menu  had a lot of great selections.  I chose the fun ghi. The toppings included caramelized mushrooms,  onions,  and cheese. The burger itself was the size of two quarter pounders and very tasty.  The bun was delicious and perfect. The fries were okay, nothing to write home about.  I probably should've picked the onion rings ($2.50) or sweet potato fries.  I also has a cookies and cream shake. Around the glass room was reese's, a big ice cream sandwich, small crunch balls. I opted out of the vodka shot, but next time I won't! The shake was great I still had some left over. The service was great , we were checked on by multiple staff, and drinks stayed full. I was so glad I finally tried this place. I'll be back!",

They probably looked 1/2 pound patties or maybe more. You can also substitute the patty for a different one if you aren't feeling the kind as they make the burger. They give you complimentary popcorn in the beginning which is different but tasted a little stale. Also the hostess's at the front looked like they didn't want to be there /:",

Everything was terrific and flavorful, plus  the service was excellent. The sweet potato fries were just oh so slightly under cooked and that was my only thing, otherwise we had a great meal. This would  absolutely be a 5 star place if they could figure out a way to tame the noise.

The cut of meat is exceptional and the peppercorns really add a nice pop to the flavor.  If you like high quality burgers where the meat is the prominent element, this is the burger for you.    Maybe I should go with a 5star because the cut of meat really was that good, but I just had BurGR's UK Burger last night (formerly known as the Britannia Burger) and its dominance as the best burger I have ever had might be setting the bar too high and making me too critical.  The pizza flavored popcorn and the fries are top notch sidekicks to go with the burger.  I considered a shake, but nothing inspired me on the menu (could have been lack of pictures or descriptions, I dunno)...Maybe another time.  I would definitely recommend swinging by Holstein's to sink your teeth into things.   You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Holsteins Shakes and Buns is located on the 2nd floor of the shopping district of the Cosmopolitan.  They didn't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays but we were heading over for an early dinner anyways, so we beat the crowds easy.  I did think it odd, however, that they placed us right beside a rather rowdy table in a basically otherwise empty room, particularly since we had a young child in our party.  While the adults selected a couple of burgers to share and one of their intoxicating BAM-BOOZLED SHAKES, the Drunken Monkey $13 Reese's, Banana, Malt, Frangelico, the toddler got the Mac & Cheese $9 off the kiddie menu, which comes with a mini vanilla ice cream sundae.  The Mac & Cheese was appetizer sized and consisted of a pool of a strongly cheesey sauce with some noodles swimming in it.  The sundae, however, had two scoops of vanilla bean flecked ice cream topped with whipped cream and a scattering of candies.  The burgers were not particularly oversized, though they were on the tall side.  While I somewhat preferred the The Rising Sun $18 Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo, Tempura Avocado with its sweet sauce, my DC preferred the saltier Gold Standard $18.50 Dry Aged Beef Sirloin Burger With Smoked Bacon, Aged Goat Cheddar Cheese, Tomato Confit, Baby Arugula & Garlic-Chive Aioli.  We upgraded one of the accompanying fries to sweet potato for $2, which I enjoyed a lot more than their relatively wimpy plain potato cousins.  Given the size of this restaurant, I was a bit surprised that the bathrooms were each of the single person variety, with no changing table inside, till I was reminded that there might be additional shared bathrooms out in the shopping center.",

The burgers are quite delicious and they have such unique options to choose from!  Their service is top-notch from start to finish as well. The restaurant was busy so we put our names down and were given a buzzer and told it would take 20 minutes for us to get seated. It wasn't even 5 minutes before our buzzer went off and we were ushered to our table.  Our waiter was very nice and accommodated our substitution requests.  He also made sure to get our orders in before he took the orders of a much larger group. It was much appreciated!  As for the food, I ordered The Rising Sun burger, which came with kobe beef, tempura avocado, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, and spicy mayo.  It ordinarily comes with crispy yam as well, but I asked them to take that off, which they did.  My burger came with a side of fries, which I loved.  I LOVED my burger!!! The meat was of high quality and I just loved how those ingredients melded together so perfectly!   My friends ordered burgers as well, but our waiter gladly substituted salads for their fries.  Excellent option if you're at the Cosmopolitan.  It's not as upscale / pricey as most of the other restaurants in the hotel, but it's definitely nice for a casual dinner, especially if you are in the particular mood for a specialty burger!",

Truffle Mac n' Cheese (creamy tallegio-mascarpone sauce, w/ Maine lobster, & black truffle) was good and served in a mini iron dish.     Burgers:  The Rising Sun (kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado), Nom Nom (kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island dressing) and the Gold Standard (dry aged beef sirloin burger w/ smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, & garlic-chive aioli) are the best on the menu served Medium Rare. DO NOT FORGET TO TOP YOUR BURGER WITH AN EGG! They come with fries but you can get onion rings or sweet potato fries for an upcharge. I recommend the onion rings.     Shakes:  We tired the Coffee and Donuts (coffee ice cream, cake donut, malt, patron xo cafe, chocolate espresso beans) and the Campfire Smores (Smirnoff marshmallow vodka, chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker crumble). They were both good.     Overall, this is a must stop place when we are here. The price of the burgers are not fast food prices but they don't taste like fast food burgers either. I see too many reviews complaining about the price and I wonder what in the world did they order. They must have forgot to get the egg or they just don't know what a good burger tastes like.     On weekends they have a DJ and makes it an even better experience. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "Just like Rodgers and Luck are in the upper tier of NFL qbs, I consider Holstein's in the upper tier for burgers in Vegas. They have a classic burger and the rest are creations with flavorful combinations. The beef is quality, cooked to order, and juicy with a bun that will hold the burger together with its toppings. I've been pleased with every burger that I've tried.  I've had the Gold Standard, Fun-ghi, Steakhouse Burger, and Longhorn Burger with the Steakhouse Burger being my favorite. The Longhorn is the burger I ordered on my most recent visit. I think the cole slaw, barbecue sauce, and brisket with the burger is a very good combination. The Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout from the above average beer selection paired well with my burger.  The price of the burger includes the natural cut fries which are standard, not exceptional. There are plenty of other add-ons, including foie, that you can choose to augment your burger. If you order a shake, you are given a full glass plus the tin. I can't speak at all about dessert.  Service from Shina was excellent on our most recent visit without an extended wait from the kitchen. I would say most of the food is priced at least $3 over what you would expect. Go in knowing you're going drop a little cash, but also go in knowing you're going to get a solid, top-end burger",

Waiter gave us 3 waters when we asked for four, went to go back and get another one and never came back. Had to ask a manager for water, that time. Water was never refilled. One person in our party spilled some water? Took a manager to get some help with the cleanup. And then the water was never refilled.   My burger was okay. I had the nom mom. For kobe beef at medium rare, it shouldn't have felt so dry. Potato chips dried it out, I think. The thousand island dressing and cheddar was lacking. Wasn't really worth the $18 I spent on it. French fries were delicious, though!   Food could've been better. Service even more so.",

    "text": "After spending an hour at Louis Vuitton at Crystals, I came here for dinner.  The place was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  I was seated quickly and looked over the menu.  My server, Kayla, brought me iced tea quickly and then I ordered.  I got the El Caliente burger.  The menu describes it this way:  Beef Patty Topped w/ Pepper Jack Cheese, Pickled Jalapeno, Avocado, Pork Chicharrones & Tequila-Cilantro Mayo.  I asked for the burger to be cooked rare and it came out just that way.  Score.  There's a lot going on with the burger.  While there is some spiciness from the jalapeno, que no es real caliente.  This is something that anyone can eat unless they have no tolerance at all for anything that has the slightest spiciness.  The chicharrones with the cheese and soft meat was a nice combination of textures. The burger was very juicy and I had to use my napkin several times to keep from getting juices from fingers to clothes.  The fries were good.  They didn't need salt which was good because there were no salt nor pepper shakers in sight.  I passed on dessert because it was more of a share kind of thing and I didn't want four brownies, two dips of ice cream and all the other accouterments that went with the dessert I was thinking of ordering.  Service was good.  I felt sorry for Kayla because access to the table I was at was partially blocked by a stroller from the family at the next table./  Their kids were very good and it was the birthday of one of them and the staff brought him a milkshake with a candle.  A note to the parents--leave the damn Webster's Elementary Dictionary in the room.  You don't have to look up words and discuss with your kids at dinner.  A pleasant meal.",

In addition to burgers, menu includes shakes (duh), various appetizers, salads, and sliders. Note that shakes are available in regular as well as alcoholic versions.  Ironically, I found that the beer menu available here was more impressive than that found at B&B: Burgers and Beer.  The Fun-Ghi: Beef Patty Topped w/ Forest Mushrooms, caramelized onion, Gruyere cheese, frisee, & Truffle mayo. Sorry Anthony Bourdain, but I'm on board the truffle appreciation train, and this is flipping delicious. Would get this again, without hesitation.  The Longhorn burger: Beef patty topped with Texas smoked beef brisket, whiskey barbeque sauce, coleslaw, and dill pickle. This was BF's choice and as a Texan, I'm a bit more discerning about my brisket. A tasty choice, but not something I'd order again.  Appreciated that all burgers come with a side of fries- upgrade to onion rings or sweet potato fries for a $2 charge. Even given Strip upcharges, felt pricing was fair for portion and quality given here. Service at the bar was friendly, attentive, and helpful with suggestions for a good beer based on our drinking preferences.",

The regular or 'spiked' shakes are great, definitively filling. They fill your cup and you have half the shake mixing cup full with more. If you must try and have a small stomach-share one! Especially when you want to enjoy your burger. Al the burgers are good, depending what you have the taste for. For any pallet there is a burger for you.  Atmosphere is nice, chill and casual. No need for \"club\" attire, so perfect for something while out on or after sightseeing.   If you want to so more than just drink a shake or have a beer and actually want to eat, don't sit in the lounge area. The (coffee) tables are too low to properly eat a burger. If you don't want to eat stuff off your lap, then you should get a seat at the bar or the dining area. Otherwise there is nothing bad about this place.",

    "text": "We dropped into this Las Vegas hot spot prior to going to a show to grab a quick bite and catch up on the sports news for the day.  For the latter you'll need to sit at the bar which is exactly what we did.  Their beer and wine list is extensive as are the number of tap options at the bar.  I went for a bottled brew instead selecting one of my favorite tangerine ales instead of trying something new.  Their menu features appetizers, tiny buns which come two per order, big buns and milkshakes galore including a long list of boozed-up ones.  I was feeling a bit shaky, but my short supply of lactose intolerance tablets on myself made me put aside that idea of having the shakes for the night.  I stuck with my Lost Coast ale.  Pork belly buns, mini lobster rolls and tiny Chicago dogs seemed like popular picks in the Tiny Buns section, but I wanted something more substantial so I picked out the Korean \"Bull\"Gogi burger from the Big Buns section.  This was a burger glazed in a sweet soy sauce, topped with kimchee slaw, slathered with chili mayo and topped off with a fried egg.  The burgers come with seasoned skinny fries or steak fries.  Their kitchen works fast here as a short wait later we were already chowing down.  My burger (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/P7pxQFqr7yBKMMI2J51udw?select=fBXXyjMoAlX3NvotKQLd-A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/P7px...</a>) sat in a pool of glaze and it appeared the yolk on my fried egg was runny.  For a split second I considered picking up the knife and fork, but who doesn't eat with their hands while sitting at the bar?  On my first bite the yolk burst out of its egg white home and coated my face and fingers in hot yolky heaven.  There was no turning back at that point; I was going to finish this burger using my hands even if the entire thing fell apart.  It didn't by the way as the soft bun was one of the sturdiest I've ever held in my hand even soaked in with burger juices, sweet glaze and egg yolk.  The burger itself I'm thinking maybe a half pound of quality beef was cooked to a perfect medium and bursting with juice.  Considering how many ingredients were added to this burger the beef really stood out as that was the main component I kept tasting.  The kimchee slaw was nice and crunchy, but the chili mayo really provided no kick to the overall flavor of the burger.  My seasoned steak fries while generous in portion size were a bit too salty for me.  I loved my burger though just as my friends loved their mini pork belly buns and mini hot dogs.",

Besides that, the Gold Standard burger was ridiculously good and HUGE. I was so lucky I had all that burger goodness in my stomach since I drank probably half a bottle of Goose at the Marquee (at a table, nonetheless!) I would definitely come back here if I stay at the Cosmo again. I would likely order a shake the next time since I was too full to order that during dinner. The appetizers are also pretty good. I had the bulgogi quesadilla and it was quite tasty but my only wish was that it was served warmer since it was lukewarm.",

    "text": "Wow, I don't remember the last time I spent $40 for a burger and a shake. That's right, because I never did! Granted this was Vegas, but it wasn't like I was at a buffet or anything.  Though I was stuffed, and probably in a better way than if I had gone to a buffet, I left wondering how I ended up spending $40 (tax+tip included) on a burger and a shake. Oh yeah, it was an alcoholic shake. But why couldn't I taste the whiskey? Seriously, I'm not that much of a heavy drinker, either. That $13 Pumpkin Pie Shake, while heavenly delicious, did not have a single trace of alcohol in it.  Like a studious Yelper, I did my homework and listened to Steph C.'s rec and opted for THE RISING SUN (Kobe Beef, Teriyaki Glaze, Nori Furikake, Crispy Yam, Spicy Mayo & Tempura Avocado). I've never had fried avocado let alone on a burger! The crispy yam was also new for me, but man was that Kobe beef patty delicious. Medium rare perfection with that sweet and savory Terikayi Glaze. For those who don't know, Nori Furikake is a popular Japanese condiment which is like seaweed seasoning. It usually has sesame seeds, dried/ground fish, sugar, salt, and you guessed it, MSG. While I can't be sure Holstein's furikake had MSG, it definitely did not deter me from devouring that burger. It was not missing any flavor, and I couldn't be happier with the food in front of me. The fries were also delicious, but that burger was pretty unforgettable. It definitely doesn't come close to the best burger I've had, but props for making me want to return and try other menu items. Next time, it might have to be the BIG FAT GREEK (Greek Spiced Lamb With Feta Cream, Lettuce, Tomato, Red Onion & Olive Relish, W/Tatziki Sauce) or the BILLIONAIRE BURGER (Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, Port Onion Marmalade, Frisee, Truffle Mayo). What can I say, I love a good burger.",

Sweet potato fries were not burnt this time! - Drunken Monkey shake: very tasty, fresh like banana, but barely tasted the alcohol - Tomato & Feta Salad: if you don't like olives, don't get this. I personally am not a fan of olives, so while everything was fresh tasting , the olives overpowered everything.  - Lobster Mac & Cheese with Truffle Oil: Yummy!!! The lobster flavor was a little muted, but overall very tasty dish. Didn't have that heavy taste to it. Came with a cute little mini lobster BLT.   Next time: trying a new shake, hopefully one with more alcohol in it :P",

I ordered the Gold Standard Burger since everyone was raving about it on Yelp. The burger was good, but I have to say.. the fries were definitely drool worthy.  They had a large variety of \"Bam Boozled Shaks\" aka boozed up milkshakes. I had a bit of my friend's Oreo Milkshake = yum! (And I don't even like chocolate..)  By the way, if you check in on FourSquare, you get a free pint of draft beer!  Love love love the cute cow art decor all over the restaurant. It's super cute and lively. They also have TV all over the place so you could watch the games that were going on.",

The staff is usually very friendly and attentive. Ive only had one waitress that wasn't very good.  We came for the Billionaire Burger. Foie?! in a burger...need I say more? It was truly decadent. It was cooked to perfection. The meat flavor was taken to a new level by the foie. At $35 it was still worth it in my book.  also try the Toasted Marshmellow, Campfire Milk shake. It is simply amazing and Im not much of a milk shake person.  Holsteins offers a variety of different burgers and sides and I would not hestitate to try them all!",

Instead of a celebration we were greeted by a very rude young man with \"you can't bring drinks in here.\" So we walked by the greeter--no word of this policy. We're staying in the hotel and have been transporting drinking throughout. And we're and Vegas transporting drinks with no issue because everyone can...I guess some can. My wife and I are appalled at the young man at Holsteins Vegas. He told us to finish our drinks before he would serve us. Then after questioning the bizarre statement, he said we needed to leave and finish then come back. As we walked out he greeted a a group of white girls with drinks and welcomed them with open arms.   Holsteins you got a problem. It's huge and eating into your green.  This is a zero star post.",

I opted for the mini-meatball sliders and since I was planning a long night of boozin.  Our group tried the lobster Mac  n cheese and the duck fat fries.  Yum and yum.  Next time I'll try an alcoholic shake! Also from our table we got to enjoy the Marquee madness (huge lines) so that was entertaining as well.",

    "text": "Clever.   I really liked this place. To me it was fun. Cute and different ideas make this place worth checking out. Its not gonna blow your socks off but I think you'll have a good time if you're not too serious about everything. They try  - at being gourmet, hip, boozy, and on-trend - and they do all of that decently.  We had no issues with service, but it was a Monday that we stopped in. So take that for what its worth. Nobody was rude to us, our waitress was attentive and everything came out in timely fashion.  Drinks - This is definitely worth 1-2 stars on its own. They make what they call \"adult vitamins\" which are drinks that use Vitamin waters as their bases. Basically Vitamin water plus vodka/gin and some additional fruit juices. I know it sounds like pretty ridiculous but why not?  They were tasty and pleasant drinks after a long day. They were fairly strong. They also offer milk shakes with alcohol...you know you want it!  If I'm ever back at this place, I'll probably try one of these out.   Food - Mostly burgers and variations on the concept. They make a good effort at gourmet or fusion-y type burgers - burgers made of duck, lamb, etc. or with various ethinically inspired toppings.  I appreciate the attempt, but I do think that if your place has the name of a type of cow in its name, you should probably offer at least a handful of beef burgers.   Anyways, I had the \"Classic\" which is a beef patty-based burger with cheese. It was fantastic! Perfectly cooked and juicy. The patty itself maybe had a touch more salt than it needed but when eaten with bread, condiments, and toppings its fine.  The bun was nicely toasted and buttery. The Classic is your standard burger with lettuce, tomato, mayo, ketchup, and onion.  You can add on varying cheeses or a number of other toppings (fried egg, bacon, mushrooms, beef brisket, etc).   I like the offerings and variety of flavors and palettes this place can appeal to. The quality of the ingredients is great. The flavors are nice. Food and drinks here are made unabashedly. Will definitely come back if I'm at the Cosmo.",

    "text": "I'm just going to call a spade a spade and if you're looking for burgers there are better places.  People often get hung up on the new trend of gourmet burgers, and they can be great, but one thing you have to remember is that it has to be knock you off your feet good if you're going to charge more than the average burger.  I think there is a special place burger fans keep in their heart for a good burger.  Maybe it's because we love them so much we're always searching for a better burger experience.  I just want a burger that scratches that itch and is savory, juicy, and good.  I've had upscale burgers that do that for me and I am no stranger to a good In-N-out.  It just has to be good, it doesn't have to be expensive.  I honestly love burgers so much I would eat one out of the back of somebodies trunk if it was damn good.  Holsteins has disappointing me twice with different burgers, and each time has giving me the weirdest stomach pains.  I'm just not a fan of this place.  Each time I leave I just wish I went to one of the other great burger places in Vegas.  Maybe I'm not who they are trying to get with their brand of food, because I do like some of their other items that aren't burgers.  Do you come to a place that touts burgers and shakes for their side dishes though?  No you come for that slab of meat in between two buns.  I don't care how much kitschy items you pile on to it it still has to be good at its core.  So hold the aioli sauce, take off the shiitake mushrooms, and 86 the truffles or whatever you want to try to spruce up the burger.  Make your burgers something I crave and I'll be back in, meanwhile you can find me at one of the great burger  food trucks or in-N-out with grease all over my fingers.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch on the opening week at Cosmopolitan.  It's on the same floor as some other restaurants but seems to get more business than the others; we had a 20 minute wait.  Once we were seated, we noticed that there were a lot of empty tables in the restaurant; I'm guessing that they're a little understaffed.  I had the Gold Standard cheeseburger, which comes with sirloin beef, bacon, sliced goat cheese, arugula, tomato confit, and a garlic aioli.  The burger was quite good.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Unlike a lot of gourmet cheeseburgers I've had, the grill taste isn't overly aggressive here.  The bacon definitely made an impact and the arugula, while mostly dominated by the other ingredients, added a nice crunch to cut the grease.  I upgraded my fries order to the duck fat fries.  It was my first time trying duck fat fries, but I wasn't impressed.  I was hoping to taste some duck in there!  They were definitely crunchier than the standard fry, but the steak fries here are very tasty as well and I would recommend those instead.  I also had the Campfire Smores spiked milkshake, which was delicious.  Very creamy and chocolatey, but for a spiked milkshake it was perhaps too smooth.  In conclusion: This is one of the better gourmet cheeseburgers I've had in Las Vegas so far.  Stick with the steak fries unless you're curious about the duck fat or really like your fries crunchy.",

Our waitress was friendly and attentive and when she wasnt available, the other wait staff was readily available.  Great atmosphere, interesting decor, yummy food!  I had a strawberry shake and the Rising Sun Burger, which was good!  I did need extra Teri sauce as it didn't seem there was much on the burger, but I often have to ask for more sauce on the side for my burgers no matter where I go.

    "text": "What a disappointing experience! My fiance and I chose Holsteins this past Sunday. We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren't seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry.   After eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn't make a reservation but it shouldn't be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm.   Fast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I'm upset so I complained and asked for a manager's contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me.   The service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, \"Well, you guys sure got a late seat\". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend's diet coke but my fiance's Miller Lite didn't come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn't inquire about our food. He didn't open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome.   The food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. As someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing.",

    "text": "After driving 6  1/2 hours vs the usual less than 4 to vegas, we were too tired to drive to Bachi, so we decided to try Holsteins. Besides H, another couple joined us for dinner.  1. H had the Billionaire Burger (Kobe with foie gras), disappointment. Foie gras was wayyy overcooked and hard, we couldn't taste any of the port onion marmalade nor the truffle mayo that's supposed to be part of it. I will pay $15, not $32 for it. 2. I had the Big Fat Greek (lamb burger). It was very flavorful, but unfortunately very salty. The olive relish was almost as thick as the burger, wtheck! 3. Male friend ordered the Rising Sun(kobe with teriyaki glaze) was possibly the highlight of the meal. Soo yummy, but I think they forgot the avocado that's suppose to come with it. :\\ 4. My 'will do anything for lobster' female friend possibly made the worst choice. Maine lobster roll for $16.50. The two rolls were COLD, and they were not rolls, at least not where I came from haha.Those were two tiny slices of folded white sandwich bread with grill marks. Two bites, that's all it took for finish her 'meal'. Wtheck!  Our server Adam never cracked a smile. I can't say the service was bad, but just very basic. I also didn't like the fact that he took our dessert menus away for the table next to us without asking first. i wasn't done yet! So we didn't order any. I would like to leave a 10% tip but given that we were with another couple (haha), I reluctantly added 15% :P  Won't be back because it's not yummy.",

My family had a Henhouse Burger and a Crispy Pork Belly Bun with a Main Lobster Roll. We thought the Main Lobster Roll wasn't that good but everything else was. When you order fries I would recommend getting the steak-cut fries because they are soft but crispy instead of the shoestring fries because they are too hard. Out of all I would rate it 5 stars.",

    "text": "Mmmm. This was our first stop/meal on a recent trip to Vegas since we were staying at the Cosmo. I had the tenderloin rossini which comes with foie gras. I wasn't that hungry, so 2 tiny buns sounded great and I couldn't resist the foie gras. It comes with some chips on the side, but I also got a side of sweet potato fries so left the chips. The fries were okay, a little too fried. My friend got the rising sun burger and said it was the best burger he'd ever had in his life, no joke! Our waitress had also told us that at least once a day, someone orders that one and says the same thing. The skinny fries that came with were indeed skinny, so very crunchy and tasty. I liked them more than the sweet potato fries, which is something I never say! My other friend was even less hungry than I was, so he got the tacos & tequila appetizer, and wasn't that impressed, unfortunately. I guess you can't go to a burgers & shakes place and expect super good seafood :\\ Oh, we also got the frozen grasshopper shake to share and it was delicious -- tiny, crunchy chocolate balls in every sip, and though there was alcohol in it, you couldn't taste it at all and didn't feel any effects from it either. You can also order all the shakes without alcohol. Overall, great service and great food, but stick with the burgers!",

During our first visit I ordered the Turkey sliders and an Oreo shake so of course it was delicious, can't go wrong with a classic meal. However during this visit, I was highly disappointed in the price we paid for our meal. For this round I ordered the Turkey burger because I hadn't eaten at all that day and more for the fact I wanted to try something different, I also ordered the Pecan Cheesecake shake off the menu to try something new. When the shake came, sure it tasted delicious for the first minute but then I realized it wasn't a shake, just a bunch of milk as the taste of pecan and cheesecake disappeared by each sip and more and more milk & whip cream came to taste even after dumping it in the silver cup of seconds. I had wished I got the oreo shake but it was too late. While waiting for our burgers I decided to start munching on the complimentary seasoned popcorn which was so delicious that when they messed up and put the goat chedder cheese on my burger instead of the regular cheedar cheese, I filled myself up with popcorn, that \"milkshake\" and water so by the time my fresh better tasting burger came out, I was full and didn't even want it anymore. Maybe this review will get 4 or 5 starts on my third visit however right now I can only give 1 star to the waitress who provided excellent customer service and 1 star to the free popcorn. At least I know next time just to stick with the same old turkey SLIDERS and oreo shake....hopefully they still taste good.",

    "text": "This is going to sound like a farce, but I daydream about my meal at Holsteins on a nearly daily basis - the burgers were THAT good.  I was a little, um, rough from 2 consecutive nights of partying, and the burgers here dazzled my taste buds and satiated my poor stomach.  We started with Radicchio Salad which was large enough for two to share as a starter and was perfectly tossed and loaded with fresh parmesan.  We split a Korean Bullgogi Burger and a Gold Standard Burger, and trying to pick the better of the two would be like trying to pick the more obnoxious twin between Mary-Kate and Ashley.  The Gold Standard was a glorious pastiche of meat and cheese, vegetable and fruit, starch and sauce.  And then the Bullgogi, with the glaze, the egg, the trite kim-chi whatever-it's-going-to-be to make the dish \"Korean\" (in this case, kim-chi slaw) worked equally well together to create a fabulous burger.  I would urge anyone to order either of these but all of the burgers looked appetizing on the menu.  My only regret (due to an impending drive back to LA) was not being able to try one of the alcoholic shakes.    Oh! And since they mistakenly brought out the salad with the burgers (I asked for it before the burgers, naturally), they offered us a complimentary whimsical dessert sampler (I think it's \"The Candy Store\" on the menu) that was great; save the mini-drumstick cones for last!",

I checked in at the hostess stand and was offered a bar seat or table. I'm not huge on dinning at the bar so I asked for a table. I was given a pager and told would be about 5-10 minutes. No problem, I'll go check out their gift shop. 5 minutes later the pager went off and I was seated in a near empty restaurant. next to a romantic couple. Nice! They couldn't have sat me next to ummm well let's see? Nobody else.  Chaz was my server. The restaurant has a DJ spinning in the front and the music blasts through the restaurant. He was mixing christmas songs with popular songs. Very interesting. I was sitting low and back to the music. and Chaz was standing tall. I could not hear him. Chaz was adequate though. Brought me an ice water while I looked over the menu.  Chaz showed me the extensive beer list but I did not want a beer tonight. Good selection though. They have about a dozen adult milkshakes on the menu. I chose the grasshopper made with vanilla ice cream, mint and chocolate vodka. It was just ok. They give you the excess shake in the metal mixer. The food menu is extensive for a burger place. A few salads, some mini burgers, and some starters. The stars are the burgers, done with different ingredients and combinations.   I wanted to try so many of the appetizers. But dining solo I only chose one. The chicken and waffles. It was lame. One tiny little waffle. It was dry. And 3 chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were good. Hot and crispy. Some ranch dressing and some maple syrup on the side. I'll try something different next time for sure.  For my burger, I tried the Longhorn. It came out medium like the way I asked. Toppings on it were cole slaw, beef brisket, and BBQ sauce. Very tasty but messy. I ate it with a knife and fork. I Beef in the burger was lean and flavorful. The bun was getting stale. It comes with shoestring or steak fries and for $2 extra you can get duck fat fries. These were possibly the biggest let down. Mine were cold and dry. The flavor on them was ok but I was expecting them to be tastier and more seasoned. I think I will just go with the steak fries next time.  Holsteins is not In-N-Out burger. Expect to spend a few extra dollars here. A $10 shake and app and a $15(+$2) burger, It is not cheap. The quality of the food is very good and I can only see this place getting better over the next few weeks.",

    "text": "As I walked through the front door...  House music was blasting.  The DJ was spinning.  Girls in stilettos and slinky dresses were dancing.  Boys in button-down shirts were standing and posing by the bar while sipping Manhattans.  You'd be forgiven for thinking that I had just wandered into some Vegas nightclub, but no.  This atmosphere is par for the course at Holsteins, which may be the most self-consciously hip burger joint in America.  Normally I'd be more cynical about the goings-on at Holsteins, but they're forgiven because they put out an excellent product.  Despite the crowds and clubby atmosphere, the hostess quickly found us a (relatively) quiet table in the corner, with a nice view of a staff artist making a new cow-themed painting to add to the dining room's already-extensive collection.  After we sat down, we knew we made the right decision by coming here, because absolutely everything on their menu is mouthwatering.    Holsteins has a pretty extensive menu, but ordering anything other than the burgers would be silly here.  I ordered the nom nom burger, which is Kobe beef, cheddar, Thousand Island dressing, and potato chips.  My dinner companion had their California turkey burger, which comes with sprouts, tomatoes, avocado, cucumber slaw, pepper Jack cheese, and a dollop of Russian dressing.  All of the burgers come with your choice of shoestring or steak-cut fries.  I *loved* the flavors of both of these burgers.  They easily rank among the best in Vegas.  The only place where Holsteins slips is service.  I asked for my burger cooked medium, and it was definitely cooked beyond that.  Ultimately, though, the Thousand Island dressing provided more than enough the juiciness for the burger.  My dinner companion also ordered steak fries, but received shoestring fries instead.  Again, this was a tiny problem that didn't affect our experience much.  Holsteins definitely warrants a return visit.  I'll let their scattershot service slide, if it means tasting more of their meaty and mouthwatering creations in a sleek and stylish atmosphere.  'Til next time, Holsteins.",

    "text": "This would be a four-star joint . . . if it wasn't a burger joint. Why? Because it's a field crowded with gems. Browse my reviews: Bowery, Stout, Umami. I can't justify giving Holstein's a 4 when those places got 4s and 5s. That being said, there's a lot of good stuff at Holstein's and I'd proudly give it a 3.5 if that were possible.   Let's start with their best: the boozy milkshakes (also available in non-boozy versions). I ordered the Fat Boy. It was awesome. Everything you want in a milkshake: candy, delicious vanilla milkshake PLUS booze!   The service: pretty good. They were very attentive and helpful with the baby . . . even when he spilled all the milk they very nicely brought for him. They were great to the adults too.   As for the food, as I said, the burgers were a 3.5. The fries were good, not great. I ordered the Gold Standard. I expected better. Not that it was bad, I was just expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. It is a hefty burger . . . split-able if you don't want to stuff yourself, especially if you get a milkshake. I can put it away . . . and I needed to ask for a box for some of it.   So I apologize if my review seems lackluster. It's definitely good, but you can probably find a better burger within a block if you look.",

The burger choice were different but all sounded so good we didn't know which ones to choose. At the suggestion of our server, Wee started with the lobster mac n cheese, so good we were sharing and I wish we weren't. Better than that was my s'mores shake.   The server had a welcoming face from the first time she came to our table till we left. She made sure we wanted for nothing. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "The name says it all. Come for the shakes and buns, but not for the burgers.   Holsteins is in the Cosmopolitan Casino on the 2nd floor shopping area. I was there a little after the lunch hour and had no problem getting a seat at the bar (I was flying solo until my peeps arrived in Vegas).   The service was decent and I quickly ordered the \"Gold Standard\" burger with dry aged sirloin, goat cheese, bacon, arugula and a wheat bun. Let's just say the burger was OK and the bun was the highlight.   Whatever taste of the sirloin was drowned out by the goat cheese. It was basically a goat cheese burger. The ingredients were fresh and the bun was the best hamburger bin I've ever had...but that isn't going to get it a 4-star rating.  The shoestring fries were cooked to perfection by extremely salty. Maybe it is to help you retain water in the desert climate. Or maybe the cook spent too much time on the Strip last night. Who knows?!  Bottom line. Holsteins was the typical flashy, overpriced midrange Vegas restaurant letdown. Good, but certainly not great...and not worth the price.",

    "text": "This place is now my must-go place for burgers. It's very reasonably priced for a delicious burger. Very comfortable booths with cute cartoon cows all around the restaurant.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE their shoestring fries! They're so fresh and crispy, slightly salted, not too oily! Okay, I might be a bit biased, since I'm not a fan of wedge fries, but seriously, try the shoestring fries once, please!  So far I've tried their Rising Sun (kobe beef with tangy teriyaki sauce) and their Big Fat Greek (lamb with feta). I was extremely happy with every bite of the Rising Sun. I was too full to finish the burger in one sitting. But I think that's just because I stuffed my stomach with like 2 long islands and a beer. Very juicy patty, I asked for medium rare, it came out medium rare. Sauce was a bit overwhelming. Their sauce is very strong in taste, I guess I should have ordered it light on the sauce. But hey, that was my first time. Big Fat Greek wasn't too impressive, I should have stayed with the beef patties. It's not too gamey, so if lamb is not your thing because of that aroma, maybe give this one a try, it's not as strong (which is why I didn't like it as much, I love that aroma). It may not look like a giant burger, but all that feta cheese and yummy meat and other stuff inside kept me very full. I was so close in not finishing my plate again.  If you check in here on foursquare, you can get a free house beer or house margarita. I prefer their beer. It's not the best, but their hef is tolerable. I tried their house margarita, and all I tasted was syrup. I can't complain too much, it was free. My server offered a to-go cup for my beer when I had half a burger and 3/4 pint of beer left. So nice of her :) Only in Vegas where you can take your beer to go.",

Nothing to really write home about and pretty pricey when it all comes down to it. I ordered the Nom Nom Burger, a Kobe beef patty with cheese and potato chips... it was good... but I'd rather call it the Nom Burger... definitely not deserving of the double Nom and far from the OmNomNoms majesty that is Lunchbox Laboratory.  Their spiked milkshakes were super good. But that really wasn't enough to push the score higher.  The ambiance is fantastic though, a great vibe, excellent service, but then again... I come to expect that in Vegas... so this ends up being a wash... it's all about perspective ya dig?  I don't believe I'd go again... but thanks for the treat and really... it wasn't bad...

The service was rocky at first with the hostess making us wait for our whole party before being seated, but that was it.  Our waitress was super helpful and gave some great suggestions. She couldn't convince us to get the milkshakes, but mostly because we had a night of partying and milkshakes just didn't seem like the right way to start out.  For appetizers we tried: - (numbers/in relation to Yelp stars) Lobster Corn Dogs (4/5) - Crispy, fried, and corn dogs! YUM Street Tacos (5/5) - AMAZING, duck meat wasn't over cooked, was very juicy. Truffle Lobster Mac & Cheese (4/5) - Truffle Oil was everywhere in Vegas and this was a great place to find it. Bull's Balls (1/5) - Dry, grainy, and should have been returned to the kitchen.  All the burgers were amazing so I won't go into breaking them down. The fries all came out very hot and done well. Probably wouldn't order duck fat ones next time, but that's because the sweet potato ones were great. The meat on all the burgers was cooked perfectly, and you could see the care that went into pairing the burgers.   Wish Holsteins was in every major city!",

    "text": "The absolute worst thing about Holsteins is that it's inside the Cosmo.  Having to contend with their awful parking lot is not what I look forward to, as great a hotel as it is.  Otherwise, Holsteins is another addition to their great restaurant line up (Jaleos, Comme Ca, E, all very tasty).  We ended up taking our friend from Australia here since he was craving an american hotdog or burger and a shake.  Having been bummed with our last burGR place, we decided to try out Holsteins based on its yelp reviews.  Not disappointed!  I'm a sucker for a good vanilla shake...and Holstein's version definitely is near the top of the list.  Flavorful vanilla ice cream mixed in with delicious whole milk, doesn't get more basic than that - but oh so tasty.  Food wise, everything was in order, though my burger cooked rare made  entree time a bit underwhelming.  Started with ahi tuna poke, which came with a delicious bed of seaweed salad.  Tuna was cut into small chunks for easy transport with the salad into your mouth - very thoughtful of the chefs.  I had the gold standard burger which comes with aged goat cheddar and smoked bacon.  Bacon was a little on the jerky side, good flavor though.  I did find the goat cheese a bit overpowering on the palette, kind if drowns out the bacon and the meat.  I've had worse burgers.  Maybe the green chile burger next time...  We had all three sides - rings, regular fries, and sweet potatoe fries.  The  rings, man, delicious.  I don't like my rings falling apart so a little longer in the fryer is just fine for me.  The batter was crispy and thick enough to hold it all together.  Chipotle dip was excellent as well - creamy with a little bite at the end.  Perfect with both fries and rings.  Will be revisiting to try the sliders or maybe another burger.  But definitely for another milkshake and some rings.",

From the menu description, the Fun-ghi burger contains: Beef Patty, Truffle Marinated Portabella Mushroom, Carmelized Onion, Gruyere, Mayonnaise, & Frisee.  We also added avocado to ours and ordered the patty to be cooked medium rare.  The burger was juicy and had an abundance of flavors from all the ingredients.  The buffalo wings were very good too.

When we arrived, there were four young ladies (staff) at the hostess stand talking to each other.  We were asked how many in our party, but they didn't shift to customer service mode very quickly. Our party of four stood there awkwardly for a bit before being seated.    It took a bit for our server to show up to the table, but he was friendly and helpful when he did.  He was knowledgeable about the menu and the Yelp check in for a free (house) beer (when you order a burger).  After we ordered, he delivered the house popcorn that had a little spice kick to it...pretty good stuff.     We didn't have silverware and napkins... not sure which staff is responsible, but neither the hostess who seated us nor our server noticed.  We had to get up and ask for it from someone after our popcorn was brought to the table (hence, we'd been there a while)...  I had the Rising Sun, an Asian fusion burger made of kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado - cooked a little rarer than my requested medium well, but fine with me.  It was pretty tasty!!  Two people ordered the lobster mac - one said it was okay and one said it was really good.  The atmosphere is lively with a DJ playing a variety upbeat of music.    Overall, the food is good but the service needs improvement.",

Well then, y'all need a disclaimer on the door!",

Everyone else was so upset that they were to full to finish their burgers because they were so damn good.  Our waiter was super cool too! He made suggestions, was very attentive and made us feel like he was a friend. We were to into our food to remember his name but if Adam Levine and Carey Hart had a baby it would be this guy. LOL!",

The teriyaki glaze was delicious without being to sweet.  The only thing i would do next time is get it bunless as the burger is huge and the bread really fills you up.  I also got the milkshake the s'mores marshmallow one and the grasshopper mint one.   Didn't care much for the grasshopper one because the mix of alcohol and mint flavor was sort of weird.   The s'mores one was delicious.  Next time i come here i would get a burger bunless and pass on the milkshake.   The milkshake is delicious but really fills you up and makes you not enjoy your food as much.",

Went again last night and the truffle fries are gone! Natural cut, sweet potato or onion rings are all that's left. The fries used to be great and now they're only ok. The service was fast and friendly, the burger was great, but the fries don't measure up anymore. You can't have a burger without fries, and it takes away from the meal when the fries are only mediocre.",

For crying out loud its situated next to a raucous venue (Marquee) where streams of pretentious people scurrying to find that VIP line.  DECOR: Contemporary and spacious layout.  Modern bar with swanky looking lounges.  VIBE: Cool and fun.  DJ spinning the latest and greatest hits from Hip-Hop to Electronic.  FOOD:   **Korean 'Bull' Gogi: Well flavored, juicy beef patty that came on soft, toasty buns! The kimchee slaw and chili mayo worked nicely with everything.  Last, but not least, the oozy FRIED EGG was the CHERRY on TOP!   **Fries: I opted for the WEDGE shaped and it was EPIC! Fluffy, yet CRISPY.  These are a MUST get.  APPETITE: FULL  SERVICE: Not much to complain about, our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  CONCLUSION: What makes Holsteins a very appealing burger joint is the creativeness in the menu however you might be turned off by the excess noise level coming from the club next door.",

This IS Vegas, and for Vegas I thought the price was pretty reasonable.  I had the Tenderloin Rossini under the Tiny Buns section.  They were two mini burgers of BEEF MEDALLION WITH FOIE GRAS, WILD MUSHROOM, ARUGULA AND TRUFFLE MAYO.  It was so good... It was a perfect portion too!  Other burgers that I recommend are the Rising Sun and Duck Duck Goose.  It's casual, its comfortable, and definitely a perfect place to go to if you want to avoid bougie and expensive restaurants on the strip.  I thought the service was great... I'm sure other people had different experience with the service depending on what server they got, but ours was very nice :)",

Last time, I had the meatball burger which is exactly how it sounds. A big giant meatball, tender and flavorful sittin on top of that burger bun. I like that it wasn't soaking in marinara sauce but instead had a layer of spinach, a small amount of cheese, and pesto spread. While I love the boozy milkshakes, I never have any room left after my burger. The s'mores one is the best with the toasted marshmallow on top.",

We were both a big hungover (hello? who isn't in Vegas) and after our less than average experience at China Poblano we opted for Holsteins.  The decor and concept are cute- modern spin on a burger joint. We were served popcorn upon sitting down which was cool. There is a HUGE beer list.. my British BF was more than thrilled about that. I ordered a cilantro infused vodka bloody mary that came in a martini glass with a ginormous cocktail shrimp.. hands down best bloody mary I have EVER had.   BF ordered Classic with cheese, I opted for pork belly sliders with a side salad as I'm not a big burger person. My food was melt in your mouth good.. maybe it was the oxygen pumping in Vegas but one of the best pork belly wraps I have had. Came with a side of sirarcha flavored mayo which rocked.  Service was great, drinks were great, food was great.. just go.",

I ordered the fried pickles, a chocolate shake and a Gold standard burger.  Fried pickles.....meh.  It had great texture, but I was looking for a slightly saltier finish.  The herb-caper mayo was really good though.  The chocolate shake, although a bit expensive, was good.  The Valrhona pearls were a nice textural touch.  And now to the gold standard burger.  I loved the texture of the bun and my burger was cooked perfectly.  The arugula was great balance to the sweetness of the tomato confit.  The flavor of the beef really stood out.  The shoe string fries were very good too with great crunch.  Very well executed burger.....expensive......but good",

The prices are spot on for what you get...I don't mind paying $15 for these burgers at all.  For the record, after this place, I'm no longer giving my money to the Ruby Tuesdays-sorts anymore.

    "text": "I had nothing but high hopes for Holsteins, sadly my dining experience did not live up to expectations. It wasn't that the food was bad, it was actually good. What killed the experience for me was the horrifically bad service and the ridiculously loud music.  I arrived at Holsteins at about 9:15pm on a Monday night, walked up to the hostess desk, and after being ignored for a few minutes was \"greeted\" by the snottiest hostess in the whole world. After some exasperated sighing and excessive eye-rolling I was told that they were full, the waiting list was full, and they wouldn't even take my name for the waiting list until after 9:30. Boom, that was it....and then she walked away. We were aghast! WTF? Oh, GAME ON! So, I walked 3 feet away, pulled out my phone, and looked at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a>. Oh hey, look at that...there are reservations available for Holsteins...now. I promptly made a reservation for 4, pushed send, got my confirmation, and walked the 3 feet back to the hostess desk. Phone in hand and with a gigantic smile on my face I greeted the snotty hostess and said I had a reservation. She once again grunted and rolled her eyes saying, \"oh, are YOU Carrie?\" After I happily confirmed that I was indeed Carrie...THE Carrie with the 9:30pm Opentable reservation Snotty Hostess said, \"I saw that you JUST made the reservation. (Eyes rolling up a storm) There is a long waiting list, but because you JUST made a reservation I will put your name at the top of the list. But just to let you know, it might take 20 minutes or more to get you a table.\" I honestly have never encountered a more snotty, hostile, and unaccommodating hostess anywhere. It would serve Holsteins well to hire hostesses with temperaments more appropriate for the position.  Here is what we ordered:  Bam-boozled \"shakes\" all $11.00  Drunken Monkey Frozen Grasshopper Cereal Bowl Black Cow  They were all fine...nothing special and not very boozey. FYI, the Black Cow is a float not a shake, despite the fact it is not marked as such.  Burgers:  Gold Standard $17.50 -  Longhorn $16.00 Steakhouse burger $16.50  All the burgers were cooked perfectly and they were tasty, but the toppings were very skimpy. I have indeed \"experienced better.\" They are served with fries...two of us chose shoestring fries and one upgraded to sweet potato fries. Sadly, both types of fries were mediocre at best. Additionally we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes which were also mediocre.  Our server was fine, but not fantastic. The music was so loud we could barely hear the waitress or carry on a conversation. Overall our experience was a less than stellar one. The experience with the snotty hostess put a taint on the evening and there was nothing that happened during the rest of our dinner that made up for it. There are way too many other restaurants in Las Vegas with bigger, better burgers and better service. I will not be returning, unless it is to punch the snotty hostess in the face (I kid! I kid!)",

    "text": "Been to Holsteins about 4 times now, and the Rising Sun burger is my fave burger so far; tasty, crispy, slightly salty, and overall yummie! The Gold Standard burger had too much going on, and it fell apart after a couple bites. And the Korean 'Bull'gogi, with kimchee slaw, actually tasted sweet instead of spicy that kimchee is suppose to be. As far as the spiked shakes, I had the Frozen Grasshopper which was sweet and not very 'spiked.' And the service is quick, and the atmosphere is loud and bar-like.",

    "text": "Traveling to Vegas quite often has allowed me to experience several great establishments for drink and food.  On this occasion I stepped into Holsteins hearing about its reputation after spending time at Public House in the Palazzo.  I must say, I was well impressed.  First off, the beer selection is well organized with several verities that anyone, aficionados to the everyday beer fan can enjoy.  Lets not even get into what happens with the shakes!!! The menu has a fun selection of \"bar bites\", sliders and burgers.  I enjoyed a combo of truffles lobster Mac and cheese, buffalo dipping sauce and a chunky monkey milk shake with a gulden draak ale as a finisher!  Obviously I'm off my diet but the 5 years of recovery will be well worth it!  I must say the service was phenomenal!  Lara, the epitome of what a skilled server should be, was attentive, on task, quickly responsive and though busy never missed a moment to check in, smile and make sure my meal was enjoyable!  Never waited more than a couple of minutes between the order and its tabling (drinks) and the food was promptly delivered about 5-10 minutes from time of ordering.  This even while the restaurant was packed and I observed every table top full!  Well done!    In summary, I'm sure just from my limited experience the rest of the menu is going to be delicious.  I will return en force with a large group of friends to do our best to eat everything the kitchen can throw at us and drink every last drop of specialty beers the bar has to offer!  A must visit from now on when I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Holsteins was very good. A large selection of adult shakes spiked with liquor, and regular shakes also. The burgers were great, juicy flavorful meat topped to your liking. the onion rings were battered and crispy served with an awesome chipotle aioli Didn't find this place until my last trip to vegas and was very satisfied. The only minus is the price of the shake starting at 8 dollars-11. other than that Holsteins was great.",

    "text": "Where do I possibly start....  It's pretty unbelievable to me that anyone gave this place a decent review for anything but the shakes, which to be honest... were fantastic.  Quite possibly some of the best shakes I ever had.  So why just one star?  Well...  When I go somewhere that specializes in burgers, I'd expect the burger to be great, at least good...  I would have even settled for mediocre...  Instead, it was easily the worst burger I have ever had...  I'd take McDonald's over this (I hate McDonald's), and for the price I could have had McDonald's 10 times over.    So how bad was it?  Well...  Ever had a burger that was cooked on charcoal before all the butane finished burning off?  Well... this was worse.  This was kind of like directly eating that charcoal...  So maybe I just got unlucky with that ONE burger?  No such luck, because the waitress took it back, exchanged it for another, DIFFERENT burger, and it was almost as bad.  At this point, I am not sending it back again because I certainly don't want them to spit in it.  I really wanted to like this burger.  Hell, I wanted to LOVE it.  The descriptions and promised flavors were so enticing...  But all I could taste was burnt charcoal.  The waitress said that some people are extra sensitive to the charcoal flavor, but my friend had the same bad experience.  Besides... this is the first and only time I have ever experienced a burger like that.   If I ever go back to Cosmo, I might have a shake there, but never another burger.  What a waste.",

    "text": "Walking in you notice the fun atmosphere right away.  Nice Graffiti style art with little pigs dressed as cows.  I went with the Fungi burger, which was very good, and thick and juicy.  shared a 750ml Abbey style with my buddy...The fries that come with the burgers are average, both the shoe strings, and wedge, but the combo of portobello and kobe beef was brilliant.  There was suppose to be truffles, but it was very faint and could have used a bit more.  But overall the food was good, the place was fun, and the shakes are spiked, so yea...it's once again a no brain-er.  I look forward to my next visit.",
