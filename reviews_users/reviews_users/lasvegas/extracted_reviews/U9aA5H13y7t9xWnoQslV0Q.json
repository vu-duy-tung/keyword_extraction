    "text": "To be honest, I came here for the decor only. And I figured it can't really be that bad food wise.  The decor and layout is beautiful and very unique.  Two long rows of goldfish tanks.  And white cut out damask designs all over the ceiling and the walls.  It really gives it a clean crisp look, which I really liked.  I made reservations under Open Table (which wasn't really necessary cuz there isn't a crazy line) but you get 100 points.  We were seated immediately eventhough we were fashionably late (which is like totally common in Las Vegas... right?).  Our server came and she was like totally authentic Chinese, which made me think, this place has to be good.  Also they are known for their freshly hand stretched noodles.  Our server comes and she talks really fast and really doesn't give me a chance to ask about their menu.  She just wanted me to order like NOW.  So I hate feeling rushed... I ask her to give her few minutes.  We ordered the pork chives fried dumpling and their combination chow mein which is their hand stretched noodles.  It took awhile, but when we got our food, the beef was clearly uncooked, which red and pinkness to it.  And because combination has pork, beef and chicken, we showed her and she apologized and took it back and brought it back fully cooked.  The pork chives fried dumplings were quite yummy and the chow mein was pretty good, but not like I was blown away good.  They have different pricing for \"Total Rewards\" members.  I'm sure if you are looking up this review, you are in Vegas and you know what I'm talking about.  If you don't, go make yourself a players club card.  Also when you show them the card when asking for the check, they also have the ability to apply any points or comps you have on your Total Rewards.    It gave me satisfaction of eating chinese food, but like I said, I came to check out their unique decor.",

Usually never a wait and food always comes out quick.  Maybe it's different in the regular dining area?  Here is a tip - they make hand pulled noodles right there.  The name of the restaurant is Bejing Noodle.  Order something with fresh noodles.  Why would you order anything else?  Good spot for a quick bite.  You can get a noodle dish or noodle soup for under $20.  Nice for lunch or an early dinner.",

They where not very nice or attentive to your needs. We had to wait a good 10 mins after we where done with our meal for a server to just walk by close enough for us to get his attention to ask for our check. Even then it took another good 5 mins just for us to get them. The restaurant was not busy at all by any means so they couldn't use that as an excuse.   The decor of the restaurant was very nice and different. I loved the restaurants atmosphere and food. Would probably consider coming back next time I'm in vegas. But not my favorite spot in vegas for noodles.",

    "text": "Other than the beautiful decor, there is really not a whole lot to this place.  If you have a craving that just cannot wait and you are at Caesar's then you don't have much choice.  The garlic pepper crab was not too bad and was probably the best dish we had.  But most of the other dishes are extremely salty because it is Beijing style, but the chef has a particularly high salt palate, even then.  The waitress admitted that they get a lot of complaints about the saltiness of the food, but there is nothing they can do about it.  Service is an atrocity - textbook for what you should NOT do.  We were seated at a table that was filthy underneath.  When I pointed this out to the hostess, she told me to just change seats.  They refused to clean it up.  She has to be one of the laziest people I have met in my life.  I was going to complain to the manager, but even she is a piece of work.  We sat next to the kitchen, and I guess one of the other tables sent back a dish because it was too salty.  Then she and the staff started to bad mouth the customer right in front of us.  Of course, it was in Chinese, but we still understood.  She used the entire gamut of expletives to describe the customer and started to give them a dirty look every time she walked by their table. Loosely translated, it went something like - eff them, they don't know s**t, nit picking.  WOW.  This place will never again have my business.  With an attitude like that and such disregard for customer respect, I cannot trust what they will do to my food if I ever made even a slight complaint.  So I know what the 9 in restaurant name stands for. Nine reasons why should not eat here",

You notice the presence of the uncanny valley, eerily tucked into the botox-frozen veneers of the two silicone enhanced, Bebe-minidress-bedecked Chinese fembots. You notice that for some reason these Stepford wifeys have five neon-colored drinks set out for just two neon-colored people. You notice the chef, with his dead mackerel eyes and creepy, all-upper-teeth grin looks EXACTLY LIKE THE DUDE LO PAN FROM \"BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA\" and is pulling apart what are supposed to be some tasty noodles but are CLEARLY the pearly white remnants of an immigrant culture's broken dreams.  BUT broken dreams are what Vegas is made of, amirite? Our server said to us, \"people come here because they like the experience of a real Hong Kong style restaurant\" and I was like NAH YO I checked that privilege at the door when I saw the Chun Li waitress costumes and $20 price tag for a bowl of congee. Fuckouttahere with that. BUT when you're eyeballs-deep in a hangover after one too many mega turnt #selfies from the night before, that congee and a pot of jasmine tea is a godsend, even if you're getting price gouged in a tweaker's funhouse version of a real Chinese restaurant.

They brought out sriracha and everyone at our table used copious amounts of it to add anything to it.  We had a large group of 9 people and shared a big table with a lazy Susan and were sampling a lot of things.   The soups, the plates of varying kinds of chicken and beef offerings, it was extremely bland. I've never had Chinese food not taste like anything. It was like eating air.  The goldfish tanks are neat. Just don't eat.",

However, we were hungry and the Bacchanal Buffet had a monstrous line so we found ourselves at Beijing Noodle because it was close by. As soon as we sat down, I pulled up Yelp on my phone and realized that we should have picked a different location. Beijing Noodle is not for those who are hungry or have tight budgets. The portion sizes are small and the prices are high.   I ordered the chow mein noodles with beef and chicken. I made sure to emphasize that I didn't want pork. However, when my food arrived and I noticed three meats. The waitress apologized and quickly brought me a new plate. Here's how I know that the portions are small. I actually finished the entire dish in one sitting. I never finish a meal at a restaurant and I didn't even feel full. The noodles were great but for $20 I expect more. My boyfriend and his dad each ordered the beef chow fun ($17) and easily finished their plates too.   The service was friendly but they should really reevaluate either their portions or prices.",

    "text": "2.5 Stars  Okay, so I understand this place isn't going compare to any of he excellent Northern Chinese restaurants in the San Gabriel Valley. But, I was hopeful after speaking to the staff, many of which were from China. They described the food as being excellent.  The first problem with the place were the prices. I expected it to be overpriced, but this was ridiculous. I guess the lease in Caesars Palace doesn't help, nor does the beautifully decorated interior. All that being said, I expected the quality of the ingredients and the quantity of each dish to be much better.   We ordered the Pad Fried Dumplings(Gyoza), Braised Baby Bok Choy, Mapo Tofu, Beef Noodle Soup and Pan Fried Pork Pancakes. None of these dishes were spectacular. The Bok Choy was okay, the gyoza were very small and the quantity was pitiful. The highlight was the Beef Noodle soup, it was good and the chunks of beef were nicely braised. The mapo tofu was terrible, nothing like what it's supposed to be.   The service was good and they have some interesting beverages, but this place definitely caters to the American tourist. Like many of the other reviews you can get all of the dishes served here for half the price in any Chinatown.",

This was by far the most disappointing dinning experience I have had in Vegas. I paid $30 + tip for the Duck Soup and Spring Roles and was expecting high quality. The noodles were tough and knotted together, and the pieces of duck were half bone and cartilage. This was unappetizing and nearly inedible. The broth was nothing special either, and the service was awful.  The spring roles were very good, the highlight of the meal. But they were small and could not compensate for the terrible entree.   You would be better served at a fast food Chinese restaurant.",

    "text": "Beijing Noodle No. 9 is all sizzle and no substance.  The atmosphere itself is amazing--starting with the shockingly white decor, attractive hostesses, huge goldfish tanks, and even the very walls of the restaurant (white panels with cut out shapes set in front of the actual walls).  And that's where the magic stops.  Things didn't start well when the hostess (as attractive as she may be) made me wait for a table even though the restaurant was barely a quarter full.  They may have been severely understaffed, but that excuse is probably giving BNN9 way too much credit.  On my way out of the restaurant, she pulled the same routine with another diner.  Unsurprisingly, the poor service (which was neither fast nor friendly) continued inside the restaurant--sending the clear message that BNN9 neither cared about nor desired your patronage.  The Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns) was okay, with the nice soft doughy exterior as expected, but the barbecue pork filling seemed to be a little short on flavoring (at least for a what should be a high quality bun).  The Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup was enjoyable, with the seaweed and dried baby shrimp providing unique taste accents.  Finally, while I'm a fan of auspiciousness, $7.09 for a bottle of Tsing Tao borders on insanity.  All in all, you'll get better food and substantially better service (though without the cool decor) at Noodles in Bellagio.",

It made me felt like I was in a fish bowl or something, I felt I was trapped in some sort of container. It was weird, but very interesting at the same time.   The food was not as good as I thought it was going to be. As you enter the restaurant, you would notice a few chefs working at the bar making fresh noodles or some dim sum. However, after ordering a bowl of braised beef noodle soup, I wasn't able to tell the difference between package noodles and the fresh hand made ones. The soup base was a very plain beef soup, nothing special about it. The braised beef was juicy, (probably from sitting in the soup for so long) but it was flavorless and there were no sauce that accompany my order to improve the taste.  The price was extremely over price, especially for the quality of our food. My noodle soup was a small size and it was about $16. If the food was a lot better and if the waiters pay more attention to us, it would of POSSIBLY been worth the money.   I also ordered a cocktail, (Shang Hai Wave) it was very delicious, but it was about $12. It had a strong lychee flavor which was delicious and it has a sweet finish.  DON'T EAT HERE.  Reasons why: - Food was way over priced - Service was not extraordinary - Quality of food was deceiving",

I loved the Spicy fish the waiter recommended, and I also liked Buddha beer, which I hadn't tried before, but neither was different from what I'd find elsewhere for half the price.  So, if you're here and you really want this food and you can't just drive over to Spring Mountain, i guess go here, but be warned.",

The white interior and mosaic decor is stunning and mesmerizing, with the feeling of an upscale techno club melded with a spaceship cafeteria. Absolutely genius and unique for a Chinese restaurant! Service was friendly, but messed up one of our orders. Our friend had to wait 10 additional minutes for her corrected order while we were slurping our noodles.   I had the BBQ pork noodle soup which was delicious, stock was fresh and clear, meat was tender and flavorful.

    "text": "The menu is extensive. Some of it okay and tasty like Yangzhou fried rice and others bland. Most of the menu is not worth the price, especially the soup dumplings which I do NOT recommend getting. I've eaten here three time and believe the 1 stars is generous for the collective experience.  The Yangzhou fried rice is a yellow rice lightly colored and has pork, shrimp with vegetables. After having it with shrimp the first couple times, I thought it best to try it with chicken instead of shrimp. I thought the request was simple but the hostess and kitchen managed to mess it up multiple times. First, I was not able to put in my take out order over the phone. I am staying at the hotel and wanted to pick up my meal to eat in the room and the hostess said no because she needed to check my ID. Why do you need my ID to place a pick up order??? So I walked down and was given a warped wet menu to look at. I thought it was gross and asked for a different one and was told that they are all wet from being wipped. Going foward, please wipe them dry! I asked for where something was on the menu which was of no help since the hostess eithwr did not know the menu or care. I ordered anyways and told the hostess that I would pay and handed her my card.  **When I received my check, I noticed that the charge was more thank the cost on the menu.** I looked at the itemized receipt and saw that I was charged to for a different fried rice and an additional charge for chicken. As I knew what I wanted, I wanted to make sure that I was getting the right thing. I went up to the manager and let him know that I just wanted chicken instead of shrimp and did not agree with paying more for it. He recharged my card and once again the itemized receipt said something different BUT he explained to me that I will get what originally ordered. I got back to my room and did not receive Yangzhou fried rice and instead chicken fried rice (completely different) with the contents what comes in the Yangzhou..I've eaten here three times and know the difference. I called to let them know but of course, no answer. They lost my business forever.",

    "text": "One of the many restaurants in Caesars Palace. We order: braised pork ribs in caramelized vinegar, braised egg plant with spicy garlic sauce, brown rice, and jasmine tea. One thing, I am fairly good at is knowing my foods. The waiter brought us oolong tea, but he persisted in telling me this awkward tale of how the same teas can differ in taste. I could tell it was oolong tea looking at it and the aroma. I was ok with the tea. The meal was really great and plentiful. First time having ribs with caramelized vinegar and I look forward to finding them again somewhere when I am not in Las Vegas. The eggplant, and needless to say me and my family will devour eggplant if it is on the table. Small problem with the eggplant, the bottom of the plate was full of oil. After the meal, I had a great conversation with our waiter, and then he agreed the tea was not jasmine tea, and that Americans, in general, do not like their food swimming in oil. Bejing #9 and the rest of the Bejing chain, can easily be 4 star restaurants if they care for their customer a tiny bit more and pay attention to food prep before it goes to the table. I will, no doubt, find another Bejing Restaurant the next time I am in Las Vegas.",

Sitting at the noodle \"bar\" transports you out of Las Vegas to another place.   OK, let me be very clear. Soup dumplings. The best I have ever eaten.  These are perfectly super hot - you better know how to properly enjoy Xiao long bao or you will undoubtedly burn your mouth.  These are so, so hot and tasty! 10+. The crispy duck appetizer, while pricy, rates another 10. Crispy, so tasty. Get your hands dirty. (Do wash your hands after gambling and before eating please. The casino experience is so germy.)   My wife was already full when I had to have a bowl of killer Dan Dan noodles. So spicy hot, I cannot properly them. Look them up on Wiki.  You better be prepared with a cold Chinese beer.  Do not listen to the negative Yelpers?  As a Chinese food devotee I rate this experience a 10 plus, borderline 11, but it is not cheap. C'mon, you are at Caesers Palace in Las Vegas! Live it up.",

However, the good people of the world deserve to bite into the amazing roasted pork pancakes with cilantro (life changing) and the hand pulled noodles. It's been featured on multiple food shows because their food is authentic Chinese, not Americanized Chinese food like so many of us are used to. The service is below par but the food is out of this world. Go here when you have time to wait and be patient. The poor reviews here are because people don't want to wait 15 minutes for a table and another 5 minutes to get a drink. This place will give you an amazing food experience so show up without any expectations except that you will eat amazing food. On our last trip we tried several other noodle restaurants around Vegas, at Bellagio and Wynn, and none of them come close to the quality of Beijing Noodle No. 9. Make reservations and you will not wait as long. Come for lunch or early dinner and the service will be better.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant last time in 2015 and gave low rating then. Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.  We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items.   I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor.   I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?  After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.",

My friend and I bought a groupon for $35 that was good for $50, so we decided to use it for dinner. The prices are high; it's vegas, you should expect that if you're eating on the strip that it will be expensive.   Our waiter Chung was super helpful and attentive. Sometimes waitstaff treat you shitty when you have a groupon,  but he was happy to explain to us how it worked.   We ordered Steamed bbq pork buns: amazing. Sweet pork with hints of cinnamon in the bbq sauce. Three come in an order, but it's really not enough because they're so damn good. Combo chow mein: pretty basic chow mein with chicken and beef. Freshly wok'd so the veggies were tender by still had a nice snap to them. A little under seasoned for my taste. Mixed Bbq platter: normally it will come with duck, bbq pork, and poached chicken but Chung told us that the chicken is served cold. Most people are unaccustomed to it, so he recommended that we substituted it for more duck and pork. Such a great tip. The pork was great and the duck was a little too salty, but they complimented each other nicely. Oolong tea: they charge per person for the hot tea, so be aware.   Great experience overall.",

The wait staff and kitchen staff are mainly Chinese (something I look for at a Chinese establishment).  The wall decor and fish tanks are a little trippy and distracting.  Prices are okay, considering you're in Vegas. Make sure you bring your Total Rewards card for discounted pricing.  Dishes I liked: Green onion pancake Spicy cubed chicken Congee w/ thousand year old egg and pork  Dishes that were decent: Beef brisket noodle soup Hainanese chicken and rice",

I got the rabbit ramen with hand tossed noddles. It came with shredded rabbit and a lot off earthy taste in the broth with greens and sprouts. I took away a star for the disorganized Host and kitchen. My dinner didn't come out with my spouses order and the host didn't seem to know English. Overall this is more of a cultural experience a little piece of Asia to experience if you will. I would come back!",

But honestly, aside from the prices being so expensive, the food was actually delicious. Our orders arrived pretty fast...within 7-10 minutes after we placed our orders and there were still a lot of people at the restaurant.  My friend and I ordered pan-fried pork and chives dumpllings (6) as an appetizer and it was so delicious, I could've ordered 2 plates as my entree.  For my entree, I ordered the Singapore-styled noodles with shrimp, chicken, and veggies. Yes, the portions may be small for the average men, but for females...you will have leftovers if not, the perfect sized. My friend said her entree was delicious as well.  The reason why I gave my review 4 stars versus 5 is because I do agree with the other reviews....the price for what you get can get some people upset. Or feel like they got cheated out on.  But if money wasn't an issue for you, if you have any food & beverage credits or anything similar like that....this would be a great place to dine at here at Caesars Palace.",

The congee was good too, even though the late night menu thing is a bit weird given I was eating at 8 am in the morning. But it seems like the norm for Vegas. Didn't like the spicy chicken cubes because they are Americanized and not authentic. Yes it is overpriced but I understand for its location. The services are fine.

We were about to leave when another worker said \"let's just seat them\". We thought we might as well sit & order since we didn't want to go far for food and wanted Chinese food. After sitting & ordering 1 dish of soup to split between 2 people, nothing came for 20 minutes. Others who sat and ordered started eating before us. Finally someone came up and asked if we ordered soup and we replied yes thinking it was done. He said \"let me check\" and disappeared for 10 minutes. By now we're hungry & irritated. After venting to them of their poor service, we storm out without looking back. All the waiter could do is hang his head in shame & say \"sorry\".",

They really should have advised us of that before we were seated. We left and came back. Upon our return we were advised that they could seat us but we would need to be done eating by a certain time because they had a large party coming in. We quickly placed our orders. The soup dumplings were ok. The beef brisket with hand pulled noodles was delicious. The Beijing wontons in chicken broth was a little on the bland side. The chow mein was also very good. We ordered a few other dishes, I can't remember but they didn't stand out. Overall not a bad place. Quite satisfying, especially if your in the mood for some decent chinese food without venturing off the strip into Chinatown. Prices are what can be expected in a casino in las vegas.",

To our surprise, not only was the food amazing, but the service was superb. These are the dishes we tried: - Hand pulled thin noodle with sliced beef  - Har gow, shrimp dumplings  - Kung pao shrimp - Braised sea bass in a clay pot  - Baked BBQ pork pastry - Jelly fish salad - Vanilla mochi ice cream - Fresh squeezed water melon juice  The dim sum is all freshly made to order so it requires a bit of extra waiting, but it is well worth it if you are having a leisurely meal. Their freshly made hand-pulled noodles are superb, not too soft and not too chewy. All of the waiters and waitresses provided excellent service throughout our meal, The only thing that may hinder diners is the higher prices, as the restaurant is located in the heart of Caesars Palace, otherwise I would highly recommend this excellent restaurant.",

I'm sure any of the noodle dishes would be good and it's fun to watch them make from scratch. A surprisingly great dish was the tofu with scallions. I didn't think it would be anything special but it was delicious. They put sesame oil in it. So tasty. The shrimp dumplings were just ok, wouldn't order them again.   Decor is really cool and modern but not what I expected with a Chinese restaurant. It threw me off a little. It is expensive for what you get - you can get more authentic homemade noodles for way cheaper off the strip.  I would definitely go back.",

I ordered the mini-wonton soup with hand stretched noodles and it was delicious.  Very rarely have I ever had such clean, flavorful, and delicious broth in dishes like this that weren't heavily laden with fat floating on the top.

Coming from souther CA and growing up with Noodle House in Rowland Heights that pulled their own noodles too I was expecting a lot more than what we got.    The first tip that we should have left and not eaten there was the lack of big table for huge parties.  There were two on opposite ends of the restaurant that would seat 10 people at each table.  The decor was ultra modern that came out of a magazine but that didn't help the food.   We ordered two dishes as we were eat an early dinner.  We had the pork and shrimp won tons with pulled noodles and the general tsao's chicken.  My biggest complaint was the food was BLAND!!!!  The broth that was with the noodles had no flavor.  The chicken was bland as well.  Though I was hoping it would be more like a pepper sauce the dish was more of a peking style but was not sweet like I'm used to.

We started off with the scallion pancake, which was very good but definitely not worth $9.  Next, we ate the hand pulled noodles with tomato and egg, and the sizzling tofu with black bean sauce.  My partner just returned from Beijing a week earlier, and I almost fell out of my chair when he said he ate the same tomato, egg, and noodle dish every week for only $1.  At Beijing Noodle No. 9, it was $12.  The sizzling tofu was wonderful, and the sauce was so good, I ate it up with a spoon.  Yeah, I'm not ashamed to admit that.

Sauce Noodles: XO Hand Pull Noodles Sauce Noodles: Beijing Zha Jiang Hand Pull Noodles Pork and Chives Dumplings BBQ Platter (Roast Duck, BBQ Pork, Cold Poached Chicken) Stir Fried Vegetablles (Asparagus, Bok Choy, Chinese Broccoli)  The XO Noodles are spicy and made with XO (dried scallops, dried shrimp)...so if you don't love that idea, you may not love this uber Chinese dish. Though, 3/5 loved it...including me.  The poached chicken is cold...but with a hainan chicken flavor. I love hainan chicken...but if you don't like cold chicken, this may not be for you.  Everything else...EVERYTHING else...was universally LOVED by our diverse group (from LA, San Diego, Dallas, St. Louis).  The service was great. The decor was clean and modern.

    "text": "The decor is modern and sleek, not that it matters much for me.  But maybe in Las Vegas it matters a bit more.  A guy is standing near the front doing the Chinese style hand made noodle thing.  It grabbed my attention as I like Chinese noodles.  I got the fish fillet with black bean sauce as suggested by the waiter.  It normally comes with rice but I got it with the hand made noodles.  The noodles were fantastic - exactly as I hoped they would taste.  If you prefer noodles from a box, don't get them.  These are real homemade fresh noodles and taste nothing like something out of a box.  The food came out very fast but I got the fish then the noodles a while later.  In Vegas I would expect the food at the table all at once, but not that big of a deal.  As with many asian restaurants, the servers seemed to dislike their jobs and life in general.  I guess it's all about the food, which was at least average here.  Another down side was the insane prices.  I could get equal or better quality in L.A. for 1/2 the price at one of my local over-priced restaurants.  I understand it is vegas, but I can almost eat at a decent steak restaurant for the same price!  I was over $40 for some noodles and stir fried fish.",

    "text": "We ended up at Beijing Noodle No. 9 by accident because Bacchanal Buffet had a two hour wait on a Sunday night!  So, we moseyed over next door because my hungry stomach could not handle driving elsewhere.  Walking into Beijing Noodle No. 9, I felt that something was not quite right.  The hostesses were super nice, servers had the efficiency of a Chinese restaurant BUT with a kind smile.  Staff were all milling around at what seemed like a very well oiled machine.  What?  You'll bring my dessert promptly after we're finished with the main meal?  What?  You offered my husband another beer?  (He was so shocked that he did not accept his usual second beer.)  The interior was not only clean, but it was also bright and incredibly well designed.  Drawers were professionally labeled.  No, we were not in a Chinese restaurant, but we were in the surely in the twilight zone.  I have a theory there is an inverse relationship (not sure if linear or exponential) between Americanization of the restaurant (so that includes service, decor, cleanliness) and the tastiness of the food.  The cleaner, the prettier the decor and the more ept or polite the staff is, the less tasty the food probably is.  The opposite would be the dirtier, the uglier the decor, the more the staff barks at you, the increasingly tasty the food is.    Where does Beijing Noodle No. 9 fall?  Watching the chef hard at work hand stretching the noodles, I was hopeful for perfectly chewy al dente noodles.  It was amazing watching the entire process.  Boing... Stretch Twirl... Boing... Stretch Twirl.    Food: * The hand stretched noodles lacked the chew like the well developed gluten that would be in perfect noodles.  Sad face. 1.  Sichuan Dan Dan Mian - Let's talk about the sauce.  It was nice and spicy and a touch on the salty side. 2.  Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon Noodle Soup with hand stretched noodles - Perhaps my cantonese self is used to really robust flavors, but this soup somehow lacked some depth.  Braised usually means tender meat, but the chunks of brisket were decidedly chewy.  Overall, it was good but not the best. 3.  Choy Sum - Great wok hei and seasoning, but the portion size was pitiful.   4.  Xiao Long Bao (XLB/Soup Dumplings) - Very juicy and soupy - the soup filled the entire soup spoon!  Where they did not quite reach XLB nirvana was in the dumpling skin.  It was not as thin and membranous as the famous Din Tai Fung's. 5.  Sweet Red Bean Buns (mei gui dou sha bao) - Two out of the three were delicious.  The bun was fluffy and not dry, and the inside was filled with smooth and sweet red bean paste.  The third bun opened up to dry and crusty red bean.  Pleh!  Prices:  Outrageous!  I would say each dish was two to three times the price that we were used to.  I'll chalk it up to the fact that the place is located in casino, and being that it was so \"swanky\" in decor and with well-trained staff, they needed to mark dishes up for the cost of running the place.  On a side thought - perhaps, we've all been spoiled by rock bottom prices at other Chinese restaurants and like how Korean and Japanese food is pricier, Chinese food should be priced similarly?    Conclusion:  So the inverse relationship is True in this case.  It was swanky; the food was average.  For average food that I can get cheaper and tastier elsewhere (i.e. Yi Mei Deli), I probably don't recommend coming back.  Shows me for eating Chinese food in a casino!",

Ok this place is cool as one of the few noodle shops this side of Shanghai with chefs stretching their own noodles by hand!! I love to watch them pull and pull the dough then all of a sudden.....where did those noodles come from???!!! The restaurant itself looks like a futuristic music video with white decorative cut outs, bright lights, and hundreds of goldfish in large tanks. There is even a sign that says\" goldfish are not for human consumption\" !!  LOL This is a joke or there are some ghetto folks out there !!! I thought the noodles were excellent and really hit the spot.  This place is really good, expensive, and very clean. There were not even any signs of grease on the floor..... guess Its a long way from the (626) and Monterey Park !!",

The next day, we tried again for lunch and were initially told it was a 1 hour wait for a larger party; we offered to split up, but the hostess said it was still 45 min. Then another party of 4 comes along and the manager says they can seat them right away. We looked inside, and it was largely empty. When we spoke to the manager, he got us seated, but this was just really an  off-putting way to start.   As for food:  - The dumplings were pretty good - boiled or pan fried  - Veggies - prices are high for things like pickled garlic cucumbers ($11) and snow pea sprouts ($27?!).  - Other noodles: Singaporean rice noodles, mushroom and chicken noodles, zhajiang noodles - all were pretty meh.  - Spicy wontons were pretty good.   - Scallion pancakes were quite sad in texture and flavor.   If you have credit from the hotel, I would get spicy wontons and the dan dan noodles. Otherwise, I would avoid this place.",

Shrimp and chives dumpling. Was lacking some flavor, and the dipping sauce seemed watered down somehow.  Congee, with century egg and pork. When it was served, it took a while and was not as hot as hoped for as long as it took.  Wok fried chow mein with beef. Came after we had barely finished the congee, and was also not that hot. It didn't have much flavour that stood out. We had to use a considerable amount of soy sauce to help get it to not be so bland.  Honestly, with the prices charged, I expected so much more, not just for the price but the fact that we're not only in Vegas, but Cesar's palace.  I will not likely be returning. Nothing stood out as anything I wouldn't be able to make at home, or get better from Panda Express.",

The broth was super flavorful as well  Salt and pepper shrimp- this was an excellent dish because they used huge giant prawns that were delicious. Really good flavor   Chilean sea bass and tofu clay pot. This was good too. Had a ton of flavor and I love Chilean sea bass, so this goes excellent white rice  Black pepper beef with asparagus- good flavor   Overall, the service and the food was excellent the second time around.

It was a very late night when my fiance and I decided to replenish our tired bodies with food. We stopped by here and ordered salt and pepper chicken, shu mai, pork fried rice and steamed pork buns.   Let's start with the good. The service was fast and the staff were friendly. The shu mai wasn't bad but 3x the cost of what it should have been. The pork buns were ok.  On with the bad. The salt and pepper chicken tasted more like salt and curry powder chicken which I'm pretty sure that's what it was. There was less than one jalapeno in the dish which gave it no spice at all. We're talking about probably 1 1/2 slices of a jalapeno. The fried rice was very bland. It needed a lot of love to make it a dish that could charge 15-20 dollars for. Don't go here even if your very drunk and hungry",

    "text": "Was in vegas this past weekend to celebrate my fiance's birthday. We decided to give this place a try because we didn't want to wait inline for the Sunday brunch buffet.  We were seated almost immediately. Our server came over and took our drink orders. Surprisingly they didn't have just regular coffee.  But not an issue. We took awhile to figure out what we all wanted and the server was super nice about it. She kept coming back to check on us and finally took our orders.  Not sure what took so long, but our food didn't come out as quick as we expected given that we were basically the only ones in the restaurant.   I ordered roasted duck and bok choy with egg noodle soup and my fiance ordered roast pork and egg noodle soup. There were a couple of others that ordered other noodle soups, but I didn't try any of theirs.  Both soups were a little salty. The broth would have been great if there was just a little less salt in them. I realized that almost everything I ate that weekend was a little salty. Not sure if that's something that vegas does to help with hang overs or what, but too salty for my taste.  Otherwise food was ok. Service was great.",

Noodles seemed a bit undercooked but the brisket was where this soup truly failed. I am not a fan of gelatinous masses with slight hints of stringy beef. It could possibly be that I am just completely uncultured and this is what the beef is supposed to be (I am white so that is quite possible) but my husband is Japanese and he took a bite of the beef from my soup and immediately spit it right out. Yes, it was that bad for both of us. Service was a C - no refills and we had to wait a bit but have definitely had worse service. Other dishes might be good but this review is based solely on my dinner.",

    "text": "Poor service and WAY OVERPRICED Chinese food!! Almost took 20 minutes to have our orders taken and be served some water! On top of that portions are SUPER SMALL and food is only mediocre. We ordered the Dan Dan mein, BBQ pork pancake wrap, and XLB with our bill totaling $48.00 (if you use your Total Rewards player's card they take a few dollars off your total FYI!).   The only thing worth coming here to try is their BBQ Pork pancake wrap!! It was so tasty it didn't even require sauce! It was decently sized as well and we literally killed it within seconds!! Their Dan Dan mein was TOO SALTY and tasted like ramen noodles with a dry sauce packet over it.. Not too appetizing to say the least! Their XLB wasn't all that great either as the skin was too thick and there wasn't enough soup within the dumpling itself. It tasted pretty bland when eaten alone and when combined with the side sauce (vinegar plus ginger) it was decent--nothing out of the ordinary though.   Venue was nice and everyone from servers to wait staff were dressed in traditional Chinese attire so it gave an upscale vibe to the restaurant. It was hard to find at first since it's hidden in a corner near the circle bar within Caesar's Palace--right before the Bacchanal buffet.   Overall, probably won't be coming back here again, if I'm ever craving really good Chinese food I'll probably venture out to Chinatown which is only a few miles away!",

They charged $4/person for the tea. Oh my god! I've never seen any places or restaurant charge the tea like this. This is ripped off and pissed off at the same time. They also charged 18% tip on top of that. Overall, it was just ridiculous and will not coming back again. Watch out people! I think because its in the casino thats why the prices are way too high.",

They do take reservations now (during the tradeshow times at least) because it can get EXTREMELY packed. The lines at lunch can be up to an hour wait so I would recommend making reservations by calling or through opentable.   The food here is as decent as I would expect it to be. The dumplings (pork, shrimp, steamed, fried) are all done well and fairly tasty. Both the dry and soup noodles are not impressive by any means, but not terrible. My boss is Chinese and she loves it so as far as authenticity goes, it can't be terrible.   The service is where they lack the most. The food comes out terribly slowly and the waitresses/waiters lack much grace or manners. Even the managers tend to be somewhat rude and abrupt, but again, I manage my expectations. The bill won't be cheap, however this is Vegas and what meal other than McDonald's is really low budget?  Overall, it isn't terrible and you could certainly find better options, but during a Caesar's tradeshow or event, good luck finding a table anywhere for lunch. Beijing gets the job done and that's all I can really ask for.",

    "text": "I am very surprised by the number of poor reviews for Beijing Noodle. This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant and there are no P.F. Changish dishes going on here so maybe that's part of the problem. I am only knocking it down from 4 to 3 stars because the service( even for a Chinese place) is challenging and in True fashion it's hard to get away from the MSG here.   Some general notes-observations that may help: To get real hand pulled noodles is such a treat!  Quality takes time and costs a bit more plus Beijing Noodle No. 9 is in Caesars Palace- not Circus Circus. Do the math.   This is the kind of place you just need to time correctly to get the most out of your meal and to  suffer the least amount of aggravation.  During the peak lunch and dinner hours expect to wait for both seating and your meal. If you are down for waiting for the real deal then this is it, yes Chinatown is cheaper, but again you are in the \"Palace\" and the convenience and surroundings are unbeatable.  If you can heed the tips above and want some authentic and satisfying Chinese freshly pulled noodles then your patience will likely be rewarded.    Beef with Hand Pull Noodle -sensational and complex beef flavor.Not all that spicy a advertised.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/beij...</a> The XO sauce works well with the velvety noodles but the MSG is a bummer for me.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#7AfT3oZKnjLMKGoKCi4Pow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/beij...</a>  Asparagus and Scallop in XO sauce- well executed by not my favorite of the lot.  The scallops were a tad sandy and that is always a no-no.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/beijing-noodle-no-9-las-vegas?select=0cF8oXG-7lgsrwULlNGENQ#8Owy1p3ypoKRr1UGOB8ugw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/beij...</a>  The pulled noodles are as good as I anything I can remember from Hong Kong or Macau. The star of the establishment are the noodles, it's a noodle house dressed in a fancy box at Caesars. Translation, don't expect a sauce or broth bomb. You are getting exactly what they are advertising. I for one have enjoyed this place on several occasions. Don't go there when you are super famished or you will just go nuts with the process.  I for one will go back and enjoy their fine fare again, patience in hand.",

    "text": "My last review...  Went last night with my husband who'd raved about it -- it's in the old 808 restaurant location (bad) in Caesars, sort of down from Rao's and Payard...instead of closed (meaning you're unable to see inside the restaurant), it's now open (open kitchen, counters, open, inviting dining room -- and looks like it's draped in a white metal doily... they've created an entrance of fishtanks filled with gorgeous fantail goldfish -- trust me, you have to see it to believe it.  It is beautiful.    But then there's a master noodlemaker plying his trade in the front window...aahhh...that's the ticket.  We claimed two seats at the counter -- back line -- to watch the other chefs ply their woks.   Service starts out fine -- then the guy vanishes for about 20 minutes.  Not surprisingly, husband gets ticked off -- and fortunately, expeditor and another server (more senior) save the day.  We order every dumpling on the menu, one pancake (the beef), one order of noodles (with eggplant) and see a guy next to us eating salt & pepper shrimp and we have to have it, too.  The dumplings begin to come out first.  The imperial soup dumplings are not to be missed -- not that many places serve them.  Beware  -- you'll burn your lip, if you can't be patient.  This is authentic Chinese -- really fascinating stuff.  I wasn't as crazy about the shumai, but the bao were dynamite, too -- but those soup dumplings....  Everything was delicious -- until the last dish arrived - the shrimp.  The guy's looked much better than ours did.  And our dish was mealy, it had that cornstarchy needs-to-stay-in-the-fryer a little bit more taste -- instead of the snap and flavor that we love.  Husband sent it back (he rarely, if ever does that) -- and the server agreed, you could see it.  Since we were sitting on the line, we watched the server take it back to the Chef Tournant and show him -- he took the plate, walked around to the wok side of the line -  added what was left on our plate (that we'd returned) and put it on another order.  Sent it back to the expeditor to send out to roomservice.   I swear.  My husband and I watched with our jaws open.  Couldn't believe what we'd just seen.  Never ever ever have I seen a chef do that -- let alone in front of us -- and he knew we saw him do it, too.    Let's just say my husband will be discussing this in lineup today for sure and I had to yelp it.    Sadly as a result, this restaurant became a bit too authentic for my repeat business...",

Not the SGV cheap/ goodness. Going in with this mindset, I was actually surprised to find the food pretty decent. At least you know the noodes are handmade. The servings were definitely small though.  What gives this place its wow factor is the deco. The huge fish tanks that take up the length of the entire restaurant filled with swarming goldfishes as well as walls and ceilings carved out in a pattern reminiscent of the activity inside these tanks made for quite a spectacle. That's what this whole place is about - the show, fitting for Vegas dontcha think?   The waiter was super nice and serviceable. When I asked him to take a picture of us he kept on directing us where to stand and how to pose and clearly was having fun doing it. Loved that. In the end, got a pretty cool picture of us standing behind the aquarium with fishes all around.",

Trying to eat healthy, we ordered the braised sea bass in a clay pot and the Yangzhou shrimp fried rice.  The meal took a long time to be brought out--we assumed that was due to the clay pot preparation.  After more than 30 minutes the waiter walked by and said it was almost ready.  Finally a dish in a clay pot and the barely warm fried rice arrived.  But in the clay pot was some heavily battered and fried fish, not the braised sea bass we ordered. We questioned the waiter about this and were told that was the Chinese preparation.  Looking back over the menu later, it seems they substituted the deep fried sea bass with sweet and spicy sauce, although the small amount of fish in the bites did not look like sea bass--perhaps the restaurant was out of sea bass. That deception is totally unacceptable--I couldn't eat the dish due to a gluten allergy and my husband tried to eat a little fish out of the batter. However, due to the waiter's statement and not having a menu in front of us, we paid for the dish.",

    "text": "So, I was really excited.  Cause Dao Xiao Mian is possibly my favorite food, EVER.  Which is maybe why I was so disappointed.  I just saw the window, with dao xiao mian and dragged my friends in right away.  I was starving too.  I was born in Beijing, and coming from San Francisco which is dominated by sichuan and cantonese style Chinese food, I was really excited to eat northern chinese food again(yes, I know dao xiao mian is not only served in Northern China but that's where I've had the best mian.)  The mian was alright, it wasn't great, but the large price tag(only tomatoes and eggs!), and the knowledge of how much it costs in China, just didn't sit well with me.  The dumplings are just average, and they had the premade frozen taste to them.  They taste like what I make and really, that's not good for a restaurant with real chefs.  The Xiao long bao was just average, again though, I'm probably spoiled as I'm used to the crab meat and roe ones from Shanghai's Cheng Huang Miao.  To be completely fair though, I was comparing the prices to what I'd get in Beijing, for a little bit of homesickness, it was disappointing nonetheless.  Also, fish tanks were kinda weird for me.  Dead fish floating in there....",

If you want cheap Asian food, get off the strip!  With that out of the way, I found the staff very friendly. The hostess talked with us about the menu prior to going in and once seated we had a couple more questions about the noodles. The waiter was patient with us and explained the spice level of the dishes we were interested in and compared it to something that we may of already had. My friend and I each ordered the Szechuan noodles (hot & cold) to split. It just so worked out that she preferred the one while I, the other. The waiter was very attentive with making sure we were okay and that we have enough water.   The restaurant is kind of small but I liked it. You could see the cooks in the back and the guy in the front making noodles all from your table. I loved the decor with the walls, gold fish tanks, even the glasses matched the theme. The next time I go back to LV, I will definitely stop back in.",

Those fish I tend to focus more on the food though, and this place did very well in my book.   I love their Shiu-Mai and the Salt & Pepper Fried Chicken.  I have also tried a few of the Noodle dishes, braised beef, soya chicken, roast duck and a few of the fried rice dishes ( regular, beef, seafood).  Mostly good dishes, nothing really as pleasing to my palate as the Shiu-Mai and Fried Chicken that I favor.    Service has been very good mostly.  I still have not had a bad experience with service so far.  Every now and then you get the emotionally closed off server who seems just a little too professional and exhibits little personality, but I find that in most cases a little bit of friendliness on my part goes a long way to fixing that problem.  Portions are a little on the small side.  The one thing I can't get over is that charge for a small bowl of steamed rice. /sadface  But if you're not a big rice eater like me then you should have no problem there.",

He explained every noodle  style to us and seemed  pretty excited about them all. The pork pancake wrap was amazing. Brisket soup noodles was also a big hit. Second waiter Eric took over seamlessly.

She told use the portions were very small and that we need to order more.  So, we ordered the amount she recommended for the four of us.  Well, we got enough food for 6-8 people, which is silly since we were obviously tourists and couldn't take the leftovers with us.  Also, I explained that my wife was a vegetarian.  But, we only got one True vegi dish.  Everything else had pork in it, which meant my wife couldn't eat it, which meant there was even more leftover food.  And, those other pork were greasy and just ok.  If you're in Caesars Palace, see the cool decor here and then eat somewhere else.",

We decided it must be worth it, and 30 minutes later, we were seated. The entrance is lined with fish tanks FILLED with Goldfish and the rest of the decor is very trendy, hipster, China.  The tables are a bit close together, but comfortable.  I ordered the Hand stretched noodles with pork and veggies.  It was awesome, as was my husband's review of his cold (also hand stretched) noodles with beef and veggies.  My only complaint was the extra 20 minutes we waited AFTER we were finished eating, to get our check.  I finally had to flag down another waitress and ask her to get ours.  The table beside us had to do the same for drink refills.",

I ordered chicken chow mein and my friend ordered kung pao chicken. She liked hers. I liked mine without the chicken. It just tasted off. Everything they had there looks so good though so I can't wait to go back and try more! They are a bit pricey if you order an entree on it's own but they have a special for $30 that has soup, an entree, dessert, and an appetizer. I'd recommend that because it just seems like more bang for your buck. The atmosphere was very modern. Everything was white.",

If the answer is no, then take your $9 and put it in the nearest slot machine because at least with the slot machine there is a promise at a better life.  I had the beef brisket with homemade noodles and the beef brisket is reminiscent of the Taiwanese \"lo-bah\" that I used to love eating when my grandmama would make it for all of us grandkids......except my grandmama made it better.  The beef here was stiffer than Ted Williams after the cryo company got their hands on him and the noodles were not memorable, like all of Eddie Murphy's movies after Beverly Hills Cop.  I looked around and saw the other dishes on other tables and they looked bland.    This wasn't a horrible place.  Just not worth what you pay for.  In Vegas, you can get much better for $9, don't waste your time here.  For uneventful noodles and eventful prices, this place gets 1 star!",

And when i would ask for a substitution, it was met with much resistance. Then, when ordering desert, i was in a hurry and wanted my ice cream to go, they said they wouldn't - i was like \"put it in a dixie cup!\" But i do have to say - the atmosphere is amazing and the food is great - i just think the entire staff needs to go through an american customer service training - ASAP!",

    "text": "This noodle house gets 4 stars for the authenticity and quality of the food.  The noodles are freshly made at the restaurant by a chef from China.  We especially liked the Dan Dan noodles which were mouth watering and mouth numbing at the same time.  They also serve a great won ton soup with mini won tons, however I wish it was all won tons instead of a combo of won tons and noodles.  The duck fried rice was another house special which was also very good, although it was way too pricey.  Two things brought the rating down from 5 stars.  This place is not big and we wait 35 minutes to get a table for 4 and another 25 minutes to get any food served.  We got there around 11:30.  The hostesses were nice and friendly but often left the front unattended walking back and forth into the restaurant or kitchen for some reason.  The waitress however were not that friendly, and the kitchen seems too small for the amount of seats in the restaurant.  This was evident by the slow arrival of our food and the waitress stating they would not be able to serve a dessert dumpling dish listed on the menu because the kitchen was too busy cooking regular lunch dishes to make any dessert dish.  So why even have it on the menu? Also although all of the back counter seats were empty our order still took 25 minutes for any food to hit the table. When we asked the waitress she said she was holding or main dishes until the appetizer (juicy buns) were prepared and served first.  After we told her we would be happy any food she brought out the other dishes first.  During the wait for our food we tried to get the attention of the manager but he was preoccupied filling what looked like a number of large take out or special orders so he pretty much ignored the in house customers and avoid any contact with them.  So 5 stars for food, 2 stars for service.  Overall 3 stars.",

The orange and white is mirrored in the polka dots of the glasses. The orange is also found on the hostess and in the uniforms of the waiters.  The prices are higher than an average Chinese restaurant but you are in Vegas. This was one of the cheapest satisfying meals that we found all weekend. For the same price as one crepe at Payard, you can have a full meal.  Note that there is the bar up front, small tables in the back, and large round tables for groups.  GOOD: We had the pork wontons in chicken soup. The wontons tasted very fresh, as did the bokchoy. It was around $10 and is easily a full meal for one person.    GOOD: seafood dumplings with soup inside",

So, not sure if they hand pull noodles at the restaurant, or they just purchase from a company.  Dishes are really expensive. Most noodle dishes were $17-$19. Portion was small.   We had the Zha Jiang Mien with hand pulled noodles - not much meat and the sauce was very salty. Noodles were tasty, perfect texture. But, the portion size was small.  The Wok Fried Beef Noodles with flat, rice noodles (not hand pulled) was also small in portion. Just a few, large pieces of beef. Such large pieces are tough to eat - usually beef is sliced into bite-sized pieces. Beef was marinated so that it was butter soft, but almost spongy. Didn't taste like beef, and the texture was too soft. Also hard to share this dish - not enough meat to share. Dish was also really greasy, too much oil used.   Soup Dumplings - divine. Served with vinegar and ginger.   Service - eh. Was ignored most of the meal. Asked for soup spoons for the dumplings three times before someone actually brought them over. Water refills seemed like a bother.",

Beijing Noodle No. 9 was good, I dined there twice. There is a lot of variety on the menu, some of the items i had to ask about. While the food was good, service was very inconsistent. The restaurant is stunning to look at. It's very relaxing and beautiful.",

    "text": "I went here back on November of 2015, tried to post my feedback but it didn't work so attempted a few times, same result. Today I'm trying again since it was sitting in my draft inbox. This place is overrated. I should of stick to Spring Mt Road if I wanted real authentic hot pot aka shabu shabu soup.  I wanted soup so I figured I check out Groupon of there were good deals or recommendation. Long behold this popped up. Pretty decent, value at $50 for $25. Deal! Being that it's hidden in Ceasars palace it might be good right?  Walked in, took us a few minutes to find it. Don't get wrong the place is beautiful! Tanks of gold fishes all around. So we sat down, dinner time, wasn't that busy. So I attempted to order this hot pot meat (Beef, comes with cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, spinach, hand pull noodle and clear noodle.) At first the waiter advise me he was sorry, apparently you need to rsvp that since it takes the cook longer to prep it then later nicely said we will do it for you. The soup came out scorching hot! Had the meats, veggies and super red broth. Really it's the way I like it. I put in the meat for it to cook then the veggies and here I go scooping it into the little bowl. Oh my!! The flavor! What the heck is this??? There's no flavor and super oily not to mention it's plain for the Sichuan Style which is their hottest broth. Basically paid $50 extra on top of what I paid for Groupon total of $120! Hmmm should have ate elsewhere for that much. Tired it once....no thank you.   I do have photos of the place but that was back 2015. The place looks stunning but as for the food. It's not that good (only speaking of the soup I had). Came out unsatisfied for $120 meal. Service was okay. I felt like the waiter was more attentive if you're not Asian since they think they don't tip well.",

I am from vancouver and have been to china, so I have eaten some top notch chinese food, including a lot of beef noodle. The noodles here compete with anything I have had and you wont find anything as good in vegas I dont think. Hand pulled noodles were delicious. Prices are reasonable for vegas. Much cheaper and better than trendy places like momofuku. Good service. If you only like americanized chinese food, general tsaos etc, this might not appeal to you. Nothing wrong with that type of food but this is something different to try. I would definitely come back and you should try it because it wont blow the bank.",

The outside was crisp and the inside was very flavorful.  There was something cold inside of it.  I didn't take it apart to see what it was, but it kind of threw me off.  It wasn't bad, just different.  I still ate it.  The Beef Chow Mein was great and it was enough for me and hubby to share.  I also had Shanghi Wave (drink)?  I think that was the name of it.

Noodles were also overcooked. 2) Congee - TERRIBLE. Came out luke warm and not reheated long enough. Porridge base was definitely old and lacked flavor. No salt, no soy sauce, no seasoning whatsoever. Zero taste. They just add the toppings and mix with plain porridge so don't expect anything fancy. Texture of the rice was also off. If you are expecting something comforting, this is not the dish for you. Absolutely ridiculous for the prices they charge.",

It makes your tongue tingle in a fantastic, citrus-y kind of way.  It's a completely new flavor, which, for somebody who's been eating for 40 years, is a treat.

This is where my father comes out of nowhere to tell me grand story of how authentic \"la mian\" was made back in the day when there was no machines or fancy devices. To my surprise, this was one of the stories that I was legit fascinated by because of how even these noodles looked being twirled in the chef's hands.   Fast forward 20 years and I watched the Netflix documentary Ugly Delicious, which features this restaurant as one of the authentic joints catered towards the Chinese community. I finally come to Vegas to give this place a shot and I was pretty disappointed. Prices were of course hiked up but the flavors were pretty bland and not that authentic. Seemed to be catered to non-Chinese customers rather than being ultra-authentic like Ugly Delicious suggested. I got the la-mian noodles of course but with the Dan Dan flavor. This is typically an extremely bold dish with flavor but even this dish didn't seem to pack the punch that I desired.   If you want good asian food, head to Spring Mountain. There are way better options out there such as Noodle Pot for beef stew noodles. Oh yeah I got that too and the flavors were not on point.",

We thought, after a night out what a Win that we would be able to enjoy some Chinese cuisine. Going online to find the menu, I seem to not be able to find it as the selection of choices that I was given is not what is listed as the \"overnight menu\" which looks much better than our choices. I ordered a beef noodle dish and a side of pork buns. The pork buns were decent, barely filled with pork. If I'm being honest, the frozen pork buns I buy from Trader Joes are significantly better than these.   The beef noodle dish, looked and tasted horrible. It was honestly like eating a pile of mushy grease. I took a few bites and couldn't eat more. It made me so sick the next day, I could not recommend this place to anyone! The worst part was just for those two dishes, I ended up spending around $60. Worst money I have ever spent...",

Waitresses walking in and out like doing a catwalk without checking up on us, regardless of how long we were there waiting for our food. Then, a guy came up to us later telling us there was only one cook at the restaurant that day. What the hell? That is not our problem. Never come back again. Please, Caesars, close them down.",

    "text": "Had their Mini Wonton Soup Shanghai-Style and enjoyed it.  The broth was tasty and the wontons were just the right size. It hit the spot when hankering for something warm and tasty late at night with the temperatures dropping outside.  Also tried their Beijing Pork Buns and those were very good too.  They were generous with the pork in the middle and not too heavy on the surrounding dough.  I was pretty happy with what I had but thought they were on the expensive side for nothing extraordinary.  I do understand I was sitting in a restaurant inside Caesars Palace soooo...I probably should have gone to White Castle instead.  Two stars for my wonton soup and pork buns and an extra star for the cool fish tank.  Save your appetite and cash and go have a feast at Caesar's Bacchanal buffet when you get up the next day.",

    "text": "So we ended up here after realizing the buffet next door wasn't seating anyone anymore. They quoted us a 2 hour wait for a party of 10, which seemed a little much, but since we were playing anyway, we didn't mind much. The only downside is, that since we had gone to eat a family dinner at the buffet, my sister was there with her 2 babies. There wasn't really anywhere for her to wait with the kids near the restaurants, and anywhere she tried to sit, the security would tell her she couldn't be doing that.  When we were seated, we sat to the side of the goldfish. Ordered a few of the dim sum items, appetizers, noodles, and a dish with lobster that I can't remember. Everything tasted alright. I was a little disappointed with the soup dumpling, since the soup seemed a little bland, but it wasn't bad. The pork belly appetizer that I was excited for was served cold, which we weren't expecting. It was a little weird, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  Our waiter was awesome though! He was fun and addressed any issues we had right away, even offered to take back the pork belly, but we kept it since my sister was into it. Not sure if I would come back here, since I think we ended up spending around the same amount t we would've at the buffet.",

The hostess was very rude and unacomodating, many minutes passes before she would be forced to acknowledge us. At this point we are tired and against our better judgement stayed to be seated. Once seated service was poor and slow. My husband's meal, seafood wonton soup was served 12 minutes before my meal came out. I ordered pan fried noodles and beef and they served me beef chow mein. At this point we just wanted out. Very disappointed!   Sorry, we didn't speak Chinese like many of the other guests. We were literally ignored.  Let's clarify. The pan fried noodles with steak appear separately on the menu, when ordering I even asked to clarify. I didn't want the very soft mushy noodle that was served. EVEN when she placed the entree she said chow mein, again at now close to midnight and waiting, we just wanted to eat something and be out.  Your food was not great that night.",

A friend talked me into trying this little gem out. We tried a variety of appetizers. The salted edamame was a clean way to start. The dumplings were bland, nothing more than you'd get at any chain Chinese restaurant. The spring rolls had a light flakey crust and had a decent flavor.   The main dishes were larger than I expected. Each was a full plate full of food. The General Tso's Chicken was a little sweet. The sauce had a nice texture. Don't expect it to be hot, it was flavorful, but not a burner. The Kung Pow Chicken with peanuts was a nice light dinner. The peanuts added a great crunchy texture to the chicken. If you want some burn, eat the peppers.   The hot tea was sooo smooth and light. After a hard night of drinking, it will help settle your stomach.  If you are wondering how to get here, follow the signs to the Julius Tower. It is right outside the elevator lobby.",

Off to go play while we wait an hr goes by and nothing. Went back to the same girl and ask if the table was ready she looked at us like she had no idea who we are or what were talking about.  Then took us in and there was all these empty party tables that didn't even look like it was used.    By now we're all hungry as heck and the food wasn't even tasty. The bowl of noodles was overly salted The broth tasted like the kungfu noodle ramens you get in a box at the Asian market..hahaha...never going there again.

It'll be faster if I went back there, made my own noodles and cooked it myself. If I were running this place....\" Of course everywhere else nearby had too long a wait too so we waited. And then we ate. And it was unexciting. Noodles were nothing to phone home about. Veggies were kinda fibrously (i.e. not fresh). Fried dumplings were doughy. The chicken rice was bone, skin and rice. I do appreciate a little chicken meat now and again.  Lesson of the day: take a picture with the giant overpopulated fishtank and call it a day.",

    "text": "I'd really give this a 2.5 star rating, but it lucks out and gets the extra half star...  This place is pretty new in Caesar's (within the past year or so since my last stay here).  One night I didn't feel like leaving the hotel, so decided to try the Beijing Noodle No. 9 with two friends.  The entrance is really cool, with lots of goldfish swimming in tanks along the entryway.    The hostess seated us, and our old waiter came over to us.  He was so not friendly, we had to laugh a few times at him.  He literally acted like he hated us and we were bothering him by sitting at his table.  Then again, he was an old Chinese man, so maybe that's how they do it in Beijing??  I don't know...but he was pretty gruff.  The food was decent, and probably the cheapest meal you can get in Vegas besides Battista's Hole in the Wall.  They do the hand stretched noodles and it's pretty cool to see the guys doing it in the kitchen, which you can see from the dining room.  Our waiter did grace us with his presence long enough for us to ask a few questions about things, but we didn't really get much in the way of answers from his responses.  We sort of just had to guess because he really didn't explain anything we asked about.  We did okay though.  We shared three different noodle dishes, and they were all good.  We also started off with some pork buns, which weren't that great, and the vegetarian fried spring rolls, which were pretty good.  Nothing stood out at all, so the food was just okay.    The next night I was sick and didn't want to even leave my room, so I ordered take out.  This night was much better.  The hostess was super nice and helped me with my order without being a strange old man about it.  I got the small seafood hand streched noodle soup, the seaweed salad, and the shrimp & pork dumplings.  This was the perfect amount of food: two small appetizers and a small soup.  I got it up to my room and it was much better than the night before.  The seaweed salad was really quite tasty, and had yummy shaved cucumbers in it.  The dumplings weren't as successful because the filling had an odd texture and odd taste.  I only ate 2 of the 4...not so great.  The soup was pretty much what I needed for a sick night in.  Shrimp were tasty, noodles were good, and the broth was nice and light.  This place is definitely not great...but it's adequate.  sometimes adequate is all you need.",

That alone is not too bad and we dealt with it. The problem is Tony never checked back with us the entire time we were there! We had to order the rice from a different server. We also didn't have any soy sauce on our table which all the other tables did have. Again no one stopped by our table so we could not ask for a bottle of soy sauce so we just had to take one from a different table.  Yes the food was pretty good, but overall this restaurant is totally not worth the price!($17 for three glasses of iced tea?! Our overall bill was $75.) There are plenty of other great restaurants on the Strip where you will get great food and excellent service. I will never go back to this restaurant!",

After our experience, I'm not sure why it made the book.  They do have a nice decor going on.  The fish tanks and swirly, all-encompassing walls/ceiling are pretty cool.  You also get to see them making the noodles, which was fascinating.  But I didn't go there to look at the place, I went there to eat.  At first glance of the menu, I was blown away by the prices.  Super duper expensive for noodles.  We settled on a large order of noodles with pork and mushrooms (which cost $26).    When the bowl came, we were dismayed to see there were only 2 pieces of pork in the entire dish, both about the size of a domino.  The noodles were literally about 2 feet long and almost impossible to get out of the bowl and eat.  I will say that the dish was tasty, but spending almost $30 to get a bowl of ridiculously hard to eat noodles and 2 pieces of meat was infuriating.  I will not be returning.",

    "text": "For the love of God, if you see this place....run.  My girlfriend and I were unfortunate victims of this restaurant.  Having just flown into Vegas from New York that morning, maybe we were jetlagged.  Maybe the brightly lighted fish tanks allured us.   But alas, the fates took us here and it ruined our entire evening.  We were walking around Caesar's Palace and saw advertisements.  \"A noodle bar?\"  It sounded quirky and interesting enough, an honestly delightful complement to all the other restaurant reservations we had made for the rest of our trip.  So we strolled in, after quickly reading a few Yelp reviews.  They weren't positive.  We had figured that perhaps some people were too harsh, and the reviews were mixed.  Well, I should have figured something was up when the person with the most check-ins for this restaurant was our hostess.   And it began.  Taking a seat, I couldn't help notice that as opposed to the normal restaurant attire of Vegas, most of the other patrons were wearing t-shirts, shorts, and swim trunks.  At 7 pm at night.  I shrugged it off, and looked towards my girlfriend who was trying to piece together the atmosphere as it was her first time in Vegas.  We trucked on and ordered.  The food arrived 5 minutes later.  Never a good sign, I've learned.  The pork buns themselves were okay..but horribly overpriced.  Our noodle dish however, left us in such disbelief that we called over the waiter. As opposed to its 22 dollar price tag, we had gotten lo-mein made with spaghetti.  In sheer disbelief, we called over the waiter as we had felt like we were massively gutted.   We had gotten a noodle dish so terrible, I would have gladly preferred to go to the local mall, and gotten food court lo mein.    Because we're troopers, we finished the meal and reached for our check.  Still hungry, we noticed that the price tag of the meal was 50 dollars.   For a small dish of what was lo mein, badly cooked chicken, and pork buns that practically defined mediocre.  It may have ruined our evening, but don't let it ruin yours.  Please avoid this place, and find any other establishment.  ANY OTHER PLACE.  This is a waste of your time, money, and honestly, is a blackmark on a pretty great hotel.   But hey, at least they have pretty fish.",

Hand-stretched noodles seemed a good choice for the Shanghai Pork/Veggie Mein but it was soo salty with an almost burnt bean taste. We also ordered the vegetable spring rolls and they were fried on the outside but mealy and un-done on the inside. Ick.  If it were up to me, I'd tell you to skip it and find something better.",

A bowl of beef noodle stew will run you sixteen dollars.  I ended up paying a grip for a simple noodle stew, some scallion pancakes, and some braised beef.  The broth was definitely weak in flavor, and the noodles were only acceptable.  Definitely come here only if you have some comp points to spare.  Hate to sound like a degenerate gambler but the only advantage is that its quick so you can get back to the tables ASAP.  Besides that, it is incredibly overpriced, and falls way short in quality.  Don't come here expecting anything close to traditional taiwanese noodle foods!",

    "text": "Mehhhhh....  My dad wanted to come here because he saw the hand pulled noodles.  I must say I was excited initially because I feel like hand pulled noodles are kind of being forgotten and seldom used by restaurants.  I really like the modern feel of it.  Probably the only reason why I gave it two stars.  The huge tanks of fish were cool, but they looked a little dirty inside, hope the fish weren't dying...and I liked the way the walls looked as well.  My parents both got the seafood noodle soup with hand pulled noodles.  I got the Zha Jiang Mein noodles with hand pulled noodles as well.  So I'll start with the semi positive, the broth was nice, clean, tasty.  Oh and the vegetables in my noodles were tasty too.   Now the bad, the huge shrimps and scallops were nice to see, but they were overcooked, a bit rubbery.  I mean they weren't super overcooked, but a bit over.  And paying what, like $16 bucks for it, the seafood better be cooked well, dang it! The Zha Jiang Mein noodles were SUPER SALTY, gah, I could barely eat it so I took a bit of the seafood broth in the noodles. Ahh, much better.  It is WAY too expensive, WAY too expensive, but then again, it is Vegas.  But I just feel like Asian food should between $5-15  ($15 is on the expensive side and I'm NOT talking about Panda Express) Sighh...I was just disappointed, verryy disappointed.  I don't recommend you come here, don't LET the hand pulled noodles DRAW you in, IT'S A TRAP!",

You are better off going to Panda Express at the mall.  * * *   Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected.   My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)  The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited.   Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out.   The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl.   The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl.   Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express.",

So we figured \"why not\". We ordered Beef Chow Fun, my husband loves chow fun and always orders it at Chinese restaurants. Kung Pao Chicken, I always love trying it at different places. And BBQ Pork. The prices were pretty high..but we were hungry.   BBQ pork was around 17.99 for 8 slices. Expensive, but it was delicious!!   Kung Pao was about 16.99 a pretty decent amount of food for two people. But we didn't like it at all. It wasn't spicy to us, but they use way too much ginger. I felt like I was eating ginger chicken. I would not order again.  Beef Chow Fun..I don't remember price, but it was plenty to feed the two of us. It didn't have much flavor. The beef was bland, but not dry. The noodles didn't have much flavor. Sadly we had to add some soy sauce to give it some more flavor.  We ordered one side of rice 3.99  The water glass I got was dirty. I'm sure it went through the dishwasher, but the pervious drink must have left a dark residue. It looked like it just needed to be popped back in the dish washer, I don't think anyone deliberately gave me a used dirty glass.  Our bill for the two of us was around $67. Pricy for those 4 item.  I would go back, but try one of their noodle soup instead. Of the items we got, I don't think we will be ordering them again...well except maybe the BBQ pork.",

The service was good, I had lots of questions, and our server (Daniel?) was very patient and gave great input. I had a Lychee-tini, very refreshing and not too sweet. We had BBQ steamed buns as an appetizer, and they were nicely done, fluffy and a little bit sweet. Hubby chose chicken chow mein, and liked it a lot. Good portion sizes. I had hand pulled noodles (my food was the show getting tossed around up front) with chicken and mushrooms-sauce on the bottom, quite tasty. Lots of refills as needed on the water.

Seriously, check out the long line (with security) at Bacchanal and, if you're anything like me, you'll run the other way! Luckily, Beijing Noodle is right around the corner, tucked away from the all-you-can-eat crowd.  Rather than fight for a bite of food, all you have to do here is wait to be seated and order from the menu. We were lucky and nabbed two chairs right in front of the cook's station, which provided the perfect vantage point for foodie voyeurism. We watched the chef and his crew make noodles and dumplings by hand. One might think that a menu this basic takes very little time to prepare, but it's all about the details and handiwork.   Two of us split a duo of dishes, the Tomato and Egg Sauce noodles alongside Sauteed Eggplant with Sichuan Garlic Sauce. We *almost* had the Green Onion Pancake, but didn't want to overdo it. This was lunch and we didn't want a gut-busting meal! Would never have though to put fresh tomatoes and a light tomato sauce with egg on fresh noodles, but somehow it worked! And normally I don't seek out vegetarian dishes at restaurants, but eggplant is one of those foods I have yet to master at home. It was cooked perfectly and had plenty of sauce on top.   As many have already indicated, the decor is quite interesting. Glad that we sat off to the side since the whole experience is a bit off kilter. This is coming from someone who gets nauseous at the though of a roller coaster or takeoff in an airplane, so take that note with a grain of salt.",

The food came out ridiculously fast but I was a bit leery the chicken was undercooked. It tasted okay and I never got sick but it didn't seem particularly well done. Similarly, the vegetables were cut a bit haphazardly. Typically, vegetables are cut small enough to easily pick them up with chopsticks. These vegetables were left in unmanageable chunks. On top of that, I never actually got a plate. I just ate off the serving dish because no one bothered to give me one or check on me.",

    "text": "Ah the rare case of me randomly going to a restaurant with someone and checking Yelp only afterwards to discover that it's 2 stars! The service was a little weird. First of all, the 2 of us had no idea what the host was saying at all. Later, my lunch companion got his soup at least 10 min before I got mine. He seemed to like his. I got the duck meat soup with rice noodles. I don't think the noodles were fully cooked. The broth was good, the duck meat that I fished out was good. There was questionable green stuff floating in my soup which was really salty and might have been seaweed or something. Obviously, the place wasn't cheap (Caesar's Palace!). Walk out of the hotel and go somewhere else!",

The hand pulled noodles were perfect, in a soy based sauce with pork and vegetables.  Soup dumplings, fun challenge to eat and drink at the same time, very good.  Green onion cakes make a good starter, crispy green beans and eggplant yummy.  We also had the pork ribs, in a really good sauce, fall off the bone tender.  For us, it all added up to cleaned plates and satisfying lunch.  Definitely go back if wanting Chinese and in or nearby Caesars Palace.",

Then, 10 minuets after I placed my order she told me I couldn't charge it to my room because the hotel said there was no record of me staying there. After I produced several receipts from room charges I'd made that day & she consulted with another employee, she did confirm I was a guest. Then, I guess she finally gave my order to the kitchen & told me it'd be ready in 10 minuets. It took longer than that but I was grateful to finally get my food...until I got to my room and tasted it. I think I've found better spring rolls in the freezer case & the dumplings were very bland. Some kind of sauce would really have livened up the flavor...but she did not include any in my bag! Not even a packet of soy sauce. I called to ask about that and after consulting with another employee she agreed there should have been some sauce, however,  it was up to me to walk the 1/2 mile back there to get it. It's not this nice young woman's fault that she is new & has not been trained. Good management would not leave a new employee alone at the hostess desk even during the slow times. This is not the first impression you want your restaurant to make.",

So, when I checked into Caesar's I walked a few steps towards the palace tower, saw this joint and committed.  I asked for the bar, which she suggested I do a table (weird) so table it was! My waiter was prompt and my food came quickly as well. The food looked like it was going to taste greasey and bland. It lived up to my expectations. The tofu was prepared okay, but this claimed vegetarian dish has a sauce that reminda me of the congealed fat when you store pot roast at a cold temperature.  Everyone in the restaurant seemed about just enthused as me.  Had I not been starving and had this meal not been $25 pre tip, I may have just nibbled. I would not really suggest anyone try it.",

    "text": "The interior is 5 stars - very gorgeous floral design in what looks like enameled cast iron. I also love the goldfish tanks at the front of the restaurant.   The service, 4 stars - we had a very gracious and attentive server who allowed our party of 7 to split our bill without any hassle.   The food is 3 star, on its own - definitely not bad tasting food, but realize that you'll be paying $16-$20+ for an entree that, for the exact same order, would run you $6-$8 in an off-strip restaurant. I'm okay occasionally paying more if I see an increase in quality; for Beijing Noodle, this is not the case.   I had the Yangzhou Style Fried Rice (Shrimp, diced Ham, diced carrots, peas, $17) and the Singapore Style Rice Noodles (Shrimp, diced BBQ pork, scant bean sprouts, a few shreds of julienned bell pepper, $17). They were average, but edible, and on-table soy sauce and sambal oelek were welcome spices.   The wait, 1 star - we stood in line for 40+ minutes on NYE, which I guess is standard (? - I don't think so...), but they also will move any VIP's to the front of the line, of which there were many the night we came, lengthening our total wait.   The cross-contamination of food items, 1 star - beware that because they make wheat noodles fresh in house, it's almost impossible to avoid allergen contamination with non-wheat items. If you are gluten-free or gluten intolerant, you're gonna have a bad time, which I did less than an hour after eating at this location (a reaction so severe it mimicked food poisoning). My bad.    Won't be returning here in the future. Better (and safer) eats elsewhere.",

The fresh noodles enticed us to make a reservation for Sunday lunch.  We spent the rest of the night looking forward it.  We arrived on Sunday for lunch and ordered dumplings and handmade noodles.  The server came back and said that they will not be making handmade noodles today.  This was majorly disappointing, the whole reason we went was for the handmade noodles.  The dumplings, although fresh, lacked flavor and were not as good as I would have expected.  The flavors were bland and we found ourselves relying on the dipping sauce and soy sauce.  If the dumplings had been good, the lack of fresh noodles could have been forgiven.     It would have also been nice to know that they were not having handmade noodles on Sunday.  This would have allowed us to eat somewhere else.  There are many, better, options on the Vegas Strip.",

My relatives arrived from China in the United States for the first time and I decided to take them to Beijing Noodle #9 because they said they were craving Chinese food.   Despite the high price tag attached to all the items on the menu, the food quality was not bad. I myself had the roast duck noodle soup ($18.99). There were four big prime pieces of duck in my soup, lots of flesh and little bone. I was very pleased with this and the soup broth was not very salty, thus drinkable. Only thing the noodle soup could have improved on was the choy sum. The chef staff could afford to put a few more pieces of choy sum into the soup, I know choy sum isn't that expensive. There were only three little pieces of greens that accompanied the duck and the noodles. The beef chow fun ($19.99) was very authentic and terrific too. The portion size was enough for 3-4 people to share. But paying $19.99 for a beef chow fun in Las Vegas definitely angers my wallet a little bit too! Even a pot of Jasmine tea costs $4.99.   Service staff was friendly here. They speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin here. They came around and checked up on us once after all the food had arrived at our table. Waters were refilled once too. Not the best customer service here, but it satisfied our table needs.   Being the Vegas fanatic I am, I don't know if I would come back again. The menu prices are kind of baffling. I might instead take an Uber and head to Chinatown for a cheaper meal!",

We got seated right away. The severs came to get our order right away, drinks and meals coming at fast pace.  We ordered Lanzhou beef soup, beef brisket soup and shrimp fried rice. - Lanzhou beef soup with hand pulled noodle: thick-base broth with anise, peppercorn and cinnamon. The noodle is hand-pulled so it maybe chewy. Overall, it is tasty but not spicy as traditional Lanzhou noodles. - beef brisket soup: pretty good. It is spicy, thick stew beef stock.  - fried rice: light flavor, perfectly cooked fried rice.  Overall, food is decent (not comparing to restaurants in LA, SF or NY Chinatowns) but pricey! Food presentation is lacking. However, it opens 24/7 and offers decent comfort food, we just have to bite the bullet!",

If you ever feel like throwing your money away and you want to feel like a loser then go to this noodle place. Worst service worst tasting food and over-exaggerated prices. I ordered honey pork it came with some dry rice on the side and it cost me $28.99. The wife got a seafood noodle dish that also cost $28.99 it had 4 pieces of cocktail shrimp two dumplings two tiny scallops and some fish cake. Very thin noodles which were semi cooked. In its entirety the whole dish tasted like fermented fish. Not so appetizing if you ask me.   Don't get me wrong I just prices we still manage to Force this food down but we did it with no pleasure.  Like I said if you ever want to feel like you wasted money in Vegas come to this restaurant.",

Manager Lucy came out to apologize but Minzy kept trying to flame the situation by telling her she didn't do anything wrong.  Lucy was very sweet however. Might come back just to see her.

For entrees we had Pork Chow Mein with their House made noodles.  Good but a hit of soy sauce just rounded it out. Unevenly cut scallions were a negative.  Beef with Crispy Garlic really wowed.  Very tender beef with the punch of woked garlic, onions and red and green peppers.   A Lychee martini was enjoyed by my daughter.  I don't really like lychees, but it came with 3 lychees and she was happy.  75$ for two entrees, one martinis and 1 appetizer was reasonable.

    "text": "Beijing Noodle No. 9  *sigh*  Where should I start? Well I'll start with the one thing that wasn't bad with this place, the interior design. Pretty unique and different than your average noodle house. It's Vegas though, they have to impress. I'll say that it was the only thing that had me impressed.  Now with that out of the way, let's get on with the 1 Star reasons. First and foremost, the service was horrible. Our waiter took a ridiculously long time to actually get to our table and provide any kind of service. He took forever to come and take our order, bring out water, provide a fork for my girlfriend who can't use chopsticks, bring out our food, refill our drinks and bring out the check! To top that off, he had such an amazing attitude. Not! He was pretty rude, not going to lie. The food took awhile for it to make it on our table. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and we only ordered noodles and dumplings. Really?  On to the food now. Absolutely overpriced for the quality and quantity. Ordered the Chef's Handmade Noodles with Sliced Pork and Mushrooms. Barely any presence of sauce, pork or mushrooms on this tasteless noodle concoction. Plus, there weren't many noodles to begin with for paying $15.09. Yeah $15.09, because all there items are priced with .09 cents at the end. Hence the restaurant name. Laaaame. Oh, did I mention that paying $15.09 was a preposterous amount to spend on a tiny bowl of noodles that didn't taste good? I know it's located in Caesar's Palace in good ol' Las Vegas but come on! My goodness. I honestly could have enjoyed a \"Cup 'o' Noodles\" more. The pan fried beef dumplings that we ordered were ok. I've had better tasting dumplings for a cheaper price. Good grief.  Well I am completely 110% sure that I will not be visiting this restaurant ever again the next time I'm in Vegas. Such a shame that there were so many other choices out there that we ended up choosing this one. Wish I had my laptop with me so I could have checked the reviews on this place.",

The flavorless broth desperately needed some salt, or something.  Chow mein noodles and tiny slivers of beef are the only other ingredients.   Never again.  Braised tofu and veggies was $14.  I guess that's what you can expect to pay at a chinese joint inside the Caesars.  The portion was really small and the sauce wasn't very good.  Never again.  The only 'okay' dish was the cold beef appetizer.  Basically it's a marinated shank that's been boiled, then chilled, then sliced thinly with some cilantros thrown on top.  The portion was surprisingly generous and it tasted ok.    Overall, this place is a disappointment.  The noodle joint at the Bellagio is WAY better.  2 stars for the appetizer and the trippy decor.",

Also, the tables for two are very small, and you may feel a little cramped when the food comes out. The food was overall tasty, and the portions were good. The shumai appitizer was very good, but the General Tso's chicken had no chillie peppers, so it lacked the usual hot spicy taste. I noticed other tables ordered some dishes that looked very good. So maybe if you order the right dish, you will enjoy it more than I did. Overall, I would say this place is ok for lunch, if your at Caesars.

We were excited to eat hand-made noodles.  Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the anticipation. The noodles were overpriced and small in portion, compared to what you would get in Chinatown.  I had the Lan Zhou noodle. I lived in Monterey Park, CA, for a number of years and was used to high quality Chinese noodle dishes. The handmade noodle at Beijing No. 9 tasted good and was properly cooked. However, the broth it was swimming in was weak and lacked punch, and perhaps cooked to appeal to broader tastes.   My partner had a noodle salad dish that was overpowered by Hoisin sauce and ruined by tough tiny chunks of beef that resembled cat food. The Lan Zhou noodle came with thin meager slices of beef that was quite flavorful. We shared the Hainanese chicken dish. I've had this dish in Southeast Asia, and it is one of my favorite chicken and rice dishes. At Beijing No. 9, the rice was dry, the chicken slices were pathetically nonexistent and bony (and did not include the breast meat with skin), and they did not serve the dish with a side of chicken broth like other restaurants do. Awful dish for about twenty dollars.  We went to this restaurant because it was highly recommended and they received rave reviews from Bon Appetit. We would not have minded paying the higher prices if the dishes had been remotely good. However, only go here if you're trapped at Caesar's and can't get to Chinatown. If you can get off the strip, go to the myriad noodle places and Chinese restaurants in Chinatown for superb noodles at less than half the price they charge at Caesar's.   Finally, I'm wondering how wise it is to put so many goldfish in the tanks; they seemed to have no space to move around. There's no reason to subject the goldfish to such overcrowding.",

We were seated quickly and our server was attentive and helpful in explaining some of the menu items. I ordered the Dan Dan Noodle with hand pulled noodles and my wife ordered a veggie/tofu noodle dish as she does not eat meat. We also had vegetable egg rolls as an appetizer. All three things were very good. The egg rolls really stood out to me and they usually do not. Fried perfectly and very flavorful. Quite a suprise.   My wife was thrilled to get a big bowl of noodles with tasty tofu and lots of vegetables. Again the waiter steered her toward this and was quite helpful. Bam, two great things she can eat without worry. This is harder to find than a carnivore may imagine.   So this was my first time having Dan Dan Noddles, but not my last. I am a bit obsessed with them because of Beijing Noodle No. 9. I have been trying them all around San Diego since then. These are still my favorite. A bit more of a broth than most places. Spicy seasame goodness with pork and spinach. I told our server how much I enjoyed them and he brought some of the sauce without the ground pork in it so my wife could try it. Good Service.  I try to avoid commenting on price because the way I see it is that the price is there for you to see before you order. If you feel it is too expensive, don't get it. Go somewhere where you are more comfortable with the prices. I agree that the noodles I get on Convoy St. in San Diego are way cheaper than these but if you are not considering the fact that you are on the Las Vegas strip let alone, in Ceasar's Palace, well you are missing something.  We had a great time here. I discovered a dish that I now love and we will be returning here in a few days to eat there again and I cannot wait.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of all noodles, dumplings and baos and after hearings our friend's positive reviews, whom is originally from Beijing, I had to try their hand-pulled noodles...     We arrived at 4:30pm this past Sunday with only a 2 people party in front of us.  The hostess took my name down and said it'll be a 10 minute wait.  However, the restaurant was half empty with plenty of wait staff walking around and casually cleaning up.  While we are wondering why we needed to wait, our hostess was chatting it up with another hostess playing with their purses on the podium/table right in front of us.  After 15 minutes, we were finally walked to our table.  We ordered Dandan noodles, pan fried pork buns and mango pomelo sago.  The food arrived relatively quick.  The pork buns were nice and hot and was great with vinegar; the noodles were just average with minimal sauce but the dessert was quite poor with powdery tapioca.    Overall, the food was just ok especially at their prices.  We definitely will not come back nor would we recommend this place to our friends because of their poor customer service.  None of the staff gave us a smile and we really don't like establishments that try to make themselves look busy when they aren't.   I have to say  it's a good change of pace from the other restaurants inside Casears Palace and a good back up for Bacchanal's crazy long lines but if you don't make your guests feel welcomed, it doesn't matter how \"authentic\" your food is.",

Beijing Noodle doesn't have the cart service that makes Dim Sum more of an experience than a meal, but I was happy enough to just order my favorite dishes.  It is Vegas priced (expensive), and slow (because they are making the dishes to order) so minus a star there.  The scallion pancake was crispy and hot with lots of scallion flavor. I love anything with the pink, sweet, bbq pork filling - the steamed buns and the flaky baked pastry were both good. They offer steamed or pan fried dumplings with various fillings. Just be careful that they are giving you what you ordered - the servers kept giving my dumplings to the table next to me and vice versa (minus a star for that).  The steamed dumpling were kind of soggy, but the pan fried were quite good.  Make sure to take some time to watch the noodles being made by hand at the little window in the front of the shop - it's quite a show.  I also loved that they had Thai iced tea and coffee - brewed strong and mixed with sweetened condensed milk - one of my favorite drinks ever since those late nights out in college. And I loved the eye-catching design of the place, with its stark white patterned walls, and huge fishtanks - really different, and really cool.",

So many things to choose from. We ordered the vegetable noodle soup, chicken chow mein, Mongolian beef and the cucumber garlic appetizer. Everything was tasty.   Now as far as the SERVICE, it sucked! couldn't get any worse. The female hostess have no interest in helping you and there is a big sign in the front that says \"allow the hostess to sit or check you in\". Something of that sort. However, there is no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Maybe it's a cultural thing............maybe not since I'm familiar with the culture and it's nothing like how we saw. We finally sat and was greeted by a nice gentleman. Sure he was nice, and took our order but after that, we never saw him again. Literally.......No one ever came to refill our drinks, ask us how our meal was, bring us napkins, straw, our bill? We had to track down everyone for things...  All the negative reviews of this place say the same thing. The level of service is awful. Caesars Palace needs to do something about it.   Think about it..............",

Then the server came over, dropped menus and walked away...okay am I missing something?  Then when he made time for us and we kindly asked to recommend something, he mumbled the \"Beef Brisket Noodle\" which wasn't appetizing at all.   But what really took the cake for me was after we finished our meal, we waited maybe 20 minutes before we had to ask ANOTHER server to bring our bill.

They looked appealing but tasted super bland, no matter what sauce or soup they put it in (we tried the beijing pork and black bean sauce specialty and the wonton noodle soup.)  I also got the taro boba (tapioca drink) and it had huge chunks of ice and was more vanilla tasting than taro.

Staying at Caesars for a conference, we wanted a quick lunch and popped into this place.  Friendly hostess, very friendly server and very attentive staff (barely got a couple of sips on my water before someone was standing there refilling it to the brim).  I had the BBQ pork with noodles and it was VERY good.  Not bad on the check either, we were out of there after tax and tip for under $50 for a couple of entrees and tea.  Knowing how most restaurants inside the Caesars complex really jack up the prices (and to be honest, the quality of product and service doesn't justify it, they just do it because the can), the place was downright reasonable with great food and great service!

I didn't even notice it the first time I walked by until my girlfriend mentioned it to me.  Service: We arrived just as it was opening for lunch - we were the second group to arrive and waited maybe a minute to be seated. With it being the beginning of the shift I'm assuming there was some confusion as to who's table we were as we saw 3 different servers during our lunch.  However various servers didn't slow down us getting our drinks or our orders.  Our actual server was extremely helpful with our selection.  Food: I saw a few comments about it being very \"Americanized\" but I would imagine that depends on the dish. We ordered mostly appetizers we were familiar with from our adventures with Dim Sum and it was comparable... at least to the various dim sum options around Atlanta.  The only thing that really stood out for me were the Soup Dumplings - both variations.  The stir fried veggies were just okay.  Everything else we ordered was rather subpar for the price. Including the pork ribs, fried rice, and chow mein.  Having never had them before I thought these things were amazing!  Overall: I think if I had a crazing for dumplings I would make a stop here again otherwise it's a one and done for me. There are just too many other Chinese options in Vegas to make this another go-to.",

Also, I was also pretty excited about my visit to Bejing Noodle No. 9 because your typical authentic Chinese restaurant resembles a hole in the wall, but this place is really REALLY nice inside! Of course its the strip on Las Vegas, everything is nice inside!  I couldn't believe that my girlfriend, a Chinese native, when on vacation from our San Francisco suburb where most of the good food is Asian to come to Las Vegas to eat MORE CHINESE FOOD. The prices aren't great but then again, that's a recurring theme if eating on the Las Vegas strip. These prices would never be acceptable if you found this restaurant outside of Las Vegas, but it works here on the strip.   As far as the food goes, it's pretty fucking good! Any place that serves hand pressed noodles, barring any major setbacks is automatically four stars in my book. To take this even further they even have a prep chef you can see from outside the restaurant through a window hand pressing the noodles like some sort of culinary show.  My girlfriend ordered beef noodle soup and Xiao Long Bao and it was pretty bomb, I really didn't expect to find such good Chinese food in Las Vegas. I splurged and went for the $30 duck meat fried rice, which was the best fried rice I've ever had. And for $30 it better damn well be. I also ordered the Shu Mai which was actually pretty average by San Francisco standards, but still hit the spot. Also, this place gets bonus points for using real tea leaves in their tea. We ordered the Pu'er tea and drank all of it!  If your comfort food is xiao long bao, xiao mai and beef noodle soup and you're in Vegas you should check this place out. If the extent of your Chinese food experience is Panda Express and kung pao chicken you should also check this place out so you can get a glimpse of authentic Chinese food.",

    "text": "Dan dan mein (3/5) Dan dan mein in Chinese roughly means mouth full of noodles. It was pretty much a bowl of noodles with some ground beef sprinkled on top. Underneath the noodles is a small pool of spicy chilli oil. Then you mix and toss the noodles to apply the sauce to the noodle. All in all the dish wasn't bad. The noodle tasted very fresh and the texture was springy and soft. Unfortunately most Dan Dan Meins I've had actually had more to offer than just noodle. The mix the noodle yourself concept is forgivable. It also makes you realize that before you mixed the noodles. The dish consisted strictly of plain noodles.  All in all not bad. Will barely hold you over. Like two bites of a hot dog, but oh well. Sometimes you have no option on where you eat (long story).  Pineapple fried rice (2/3) Ham, shrimp, rice, and eggs. The pineapple was added like an afterthought,  even then I might've had 3 tiny pieces of pineapple in the whole plate. If you didn't know you've specifically ordered pineapple fried rice. You wouldn't have known the plate somehow involved pineapples. I was definitely a bit disappointed.",

    "text": "Trust me, I like to be honest with my ratings (generous too) but Beijing Noodle No. 9 just didn't float my boat. And I won't wait to drop the bomb here. Take heed. This restaurant is way too overpriced for your own good. If all you're looking for is an affordable place to grab some food, turn around and head for the foodcourt. My friend and I ended up paying more than $50 for a small order of spicy wonton, small fried rice and beef noodles. Now if that $50 was in Hong Kong currency, I wouldn't complain but for a meal that could've cost me less than $20 at Chinatown, I ended up paying more than double its value. And sure, it tasted authentic. Even the service was authentic in such a way that the waiters didn't even really understand what we wanted so we resorted to explaining our orders in Chinese.   The whole concept of Chinese & Western decorative fusion looked pretty interesting at first, but that hype quickly faded as we seated ourselves and witnessed the staff's cold shoulders. Midway through our meal, one of the waiters abruptly came over and asked 'Finish?' Before my friend could even reply no, the waiter was gone and we were left staring at each other. I didn't really know how to feel about the fishtanks that lined up the entrance to the restaurant and allow me to drop in a quick recommendation as an alternative. The new Bachannal Buffet is not a far walk from here. Walk over there and get your money's worth!",

You mean, this restaurant in Caesar's Palace that handmakes noodles is NOT CHEAP? Get over it. It's not pricey, either, Homeslice. I found the portions to be exactly what is expected for the amount paid. Especially considering the super cool fish tanks and decor. Oh, and that whole handmade noodle thing.   I had a noodle soup with sliced beef that was just wonderful, all-around. The taste was surprisingly perfect...I don't normally get that in noodles. But, the broth had a distinct seasoning that I really enjoyed. I also had a pot of hot jasmine floral tea that went nicely with the rest of the meal.  I would disregard the Yelpers before (no offense...). Had I not, I would've missed out on one of the better meals I had in Vegas.",

But, we stayed because we had always wanted to try it out. Actually, my boyfriend wanted to try it out, because he loves noodles. I just was super hungry from the drive to Vegas.  Anyways, he ordered the seafood noodle with hand stretched noodles, and I had the pork belly and mushroom sauce with hand stretched noodles. Both dishes were really good, although my sauce was a little bit too salty for me. Easily fixed with a little bit of broth from my boyfriend's dish. I loved eating the noodles overall.  I'm not sure if it's just me though, but I feel like if you are Asian you get better service. There was a white couple sitting next to us who ordered at the same time and was actually there before us. They ordered similar dishes, but for some reason ours came out faster, our water was always filled, and I dunno... our service was just a little bit better.   This was the most expensive Chinese food I had to date. I'm not sure how I feel about that yet, but at least I don't feel much regret. I just know that I probably won't eat here again anytime soon because I want to try a less salty and less expensive noodle place.   Maybe I have eaten at too many noodle places in my life, because this place is just okay to me. I don't feel like the price justified the food. You're really paying for the privilege of eating inside Caesar's Palace.",

I could've bought 6 wonton noodle soups back home for the price of this one lousy bowl of noodles... 75 dumplings for this one plate of dumplings, etc etc.    Ok ok ok-- the noodles weren't lousy, in fact it was decent considering there weren't many authentic Chinese options in the area.  I actually even liked the decor!  They lined the entrance with huge goldfish tanks, all white interior and even a petite Chinese girl in a short skirt  at the front (I swear she's decor because she didn't speak much English).

    "text": "My parents and I were in Vegas for 4 days and ate here at Beijing noodle No.9 twice in total. I had a great time the first time.         It's because of our experience second time, I'm only giving this place 2 stars. The second time we ate here, our bill was around $78 for three people. We paid cash and only had hundred dollar bills. One of the waitresses came over and took the money and bill, then proceeded to ask if we needed change. We said yes. When she came back with our bill and change, she sat it down on our table. pointed at the suggested tips section and said \"tips\" in Chinese. Just tips, no tips please, not nice at all.          My parents and I are very understanding people. We know that because of cultural differences, a lot of tourists don't give tips. I'm not sure why she said what she said. Maybe because we are Chinese, maybe because we asked for change? But in my opinion, there is nothing wrong to ask for change, I didn't want to end up giving $22 in tips while out bill was only $78.          I don't know her name, but her behavior was rude and disrespectful. She didn't ask anybody else around us, only us. She was implying that we weren't gonna pay tips, so it seemed to me that it was almost a warning. \" you guys give $100 and asked for change, you better give tips.\"         I have been to various other Chinese restaurants and this has never happened to me before. I hate to say that this was one of the worst dinning experience I've ever had while here in Vegas, and we will never come to this restaurant again.",

It is like they are cooking for a midwestern crowd who has diabetes- no salt - no spice.   This is new for me. I have not sent food back to a kitchen ever.   I would say this was high quality beef and chicken. Super tender.    It just was not chinese It just was not Taiwanese   It was bland. The wait staff explained that is how they normally make it.   The kitchen remade the meal and they were better.  Just not as good in flavor as one of the fast food chains take away food  Definitely not worth $25/ plate",

My parents and I had lunch at the restaurant and we were seated right away. The service was excellent. We had a variety of servers helping us, bringing our food and refilling our drinks. They offer a pre-fixe lunch menu on weekdays from 10am-4pm that includes a soup, a appetizer (this is really more of a \"side\" item) and an entree. We ordered the pre-fixe (chicken and corn soup, crispy vegetable spring rolls, and the stir-fried beef with aspargus and white rice) as well as the seafood chow mein and shared everything. The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. My favorite items were definitely the noodles and the spring rolls.

First, they stick to the small metal tins and causes the dumplings got pierce and release the soup.  Second( the soup is bland.  However, it's a good attempt, and if you haven't had the real thing, these dumplings are a good appetizer (6 dumplings for $15).  Seated Scallops with Asparagus ($27).   A generous portion of scallops and asparagus. The seasoning is light, but would satisfy most palates.   Drink: Large hot Sake ($15).   More pricey than other places, but the Sake is smooth without any aftertaste.    Service: Excellent.   Ambiance: The Restaurant is open, so it invites a lot of ambient noise.  It can be a little overwhelming, but this is not an intimate place.   Decor: Stark white patterns with mosaic design is unique.  Goldfish is acrylic tanks line the entryway.    Overall: The meal was okay, but lower prices would make the experience better. I've eaten better Chinese offerings, but this place is open 24 hours.  A definite plus when you're staying at Caesars Palace and crave something better than a sandwich.",

When we got there I was told it was a 30 min wait to dine in or 15 min wait for take out-we went with take out. After waiting several minutes for the hostess to finish doing little tasks, I let her know I was ready to order only to have her take 3 people before me. At that point I was a little frustrated, but decided to stay and order hoping for the experience to get better. I finally order led and paid for our meal but when I check my receipt I realized the hostess ordered the wrong thing.  I tried to let the hostess know, but she was so busy she just waived me off. I saw someone wearing a company logo on his suit chatting about with other employees so I let him know. I'm thinking at that point that all the issues are resolved-wrong! Someone comes over and says they lost the signature for my purchase and they need to charge me again for the order plus the $3 difference of the entree they mistakenly ordered! At that point I had had it with their lack of customer service and management. Understandably, after waiting over 30 mins from the time I had arrived I asked to cancel the order. They then have the audacity to say they cannot give me a refund receipt! I have never experienced such awful service from all the staff I encountered-they were all equally unable to successfully keep my business. Needless to say we will not be going back-EVER! Caesar's Palace should replace this restaurant with McDonalds, even they have better service than this place!",

Being from San Francisco and of Chinese decent plus having just traveled to Beijing and Shanghai, I feel qualified to judge Chinese food more than other types of food.   We ordered several items:   1. Soup dumplings - this is the best item we had based on the traits most judge their xlb by. Large, thin skin and lots of juice. Meat could have a little more flavor.   2. Beef noodle soup - the noodles are excellent. Good texture and and flavor. The soup base reminds me of northern cuisine - this is a flavor profile most westerners are probably not familiar with and thus may not like.   3. Black bean noodle - again noodles are delicious. Sauce authentic but not my favorite.   4. Shrimp and chives with egg - also authentic but didn't taste good. I've had this particular dumpling in many places and love this dish. This is just a miss.   Service was poor. People were confused and they up our order after we told them that was our dishes. They put it down on our table and then took it off and gave it to our neighbor. Waiters seemed like we were bothering them.",

Considering how many times I have stayed at Caesar's, it's a surprise that I had never eaten at Beijing Noodle before. My friend and I were in Vegas two weeks ago to run the Rock N Roll 1/2 Marathon and decided to continue our carb loading by eating here a few hours before the run. In hindsight it was a pretty stupid idea...   I ordered the combination chow mein and my friend Kim ordered the beef chow fun. The food: very greasy, bland (we had to ask for chili oil for flavor) and not very authentic Chinese. I was debating between the chow mein and the noodle soup (which, by looking at the other diners' bowls, looked more authentic and probably what I SHOULD have eaten before a run) and regretted my decision immediately.   I presume the reason the place stays busy is because a lot of the Asian gamblers are hesitant to try the other cuisines offered in the casino (that or don't want to wait in line for Bacchanal Buffet). I only hope the noodle soup tastes a lot better than what we ordered...  The menu was decently large though. They even have soup dumplings (xlb) but they are like $12 an order... No thanks. I doubt I'll ever come back to eat here...unless I had no other option...   On the way out, a noodle maker was pulling and stretching out housemade noodles!! Whyyyyy did I not order something fresh and instead got the processed noodles? Cry.... 2 stars for the food, an extra for the atmosphere (fish tanks)....though they could probably do without the plastic chairs.",

I dont actually really know how and why they still can be apart of the caesars establishment.   They get one star for being one of few places opened right in the middle of the night. But its more or less here it ends. The menu is not too much to cheer about, and the pricing is a joke. I got some small fried pork stuff for $20 that i could have just skipped having.  If you walk by and see a lot of ppl inside, dont be fooled, they are probably just there for their first and last time, as everybody else going here!",

The waiters could use a smile on their face, but that doesn't bother me. My order was taken quickly and my food arrived moments later.   I simply ordered the wonton noodle soup. There were plenty of wontons in my portion and they were flavorful. The noodles were made perfectly and the broth was the right temperature. I really liked my dish.

Was very good although wished they would have given us extra sauce on the side since we ordered To Go and didn't want to walk back down to the restaurant.  *** Shrimp pancakes were good too.  *** They gave us a LOT of rice.

Noodles were incredibly salty and tasteless. $6 Dan Dan from Pei Wei is 10x better.  Each dish was $16 a pop. Mapo tofu didn't even come with rice, lol. Never seen that before, that spicy dish without rice.  When I asked for just plain ol white steamed rice, it was $3.99.  But, overpriced food is nothing new, this is Vegas after all, it's supposed to be overpriced.  My problem is that these guys don't even try to deliver any semblance of quality.  Try Noodle Asia at Venetian if you want overpriced food done right. Mapo tofu was also the worst I have tasted, no surprise there.  Serving staffs were nice, but the hostess was very uncaring and clearly didn't want to work there.  However, I knew this place was going to be bad based on all the poor reviews, but I'm staying at Caesars the whole week and i had per diem to burn and felt lazy last night.  Taught me a lesson why you shouldn't be lazy.  Avoid this place unless you have absolutely no choice. It is open 24/7.",

I've been a fan of this place for awhile and absolutely love eating here when I'm craving salt & pepper chicken, shumai and house noodles.  I lived on Guam all my life, and I hoped to find more than a handful of places to eat really authentic Asian food. Most of them are Americanized to fit the pallets here, but I think this place keeps it as close as you can get to what I'd eat back home.  The dishes I mentioned earlier are definitely something to try when you go here.  They're all I order because it's that good.  I love the extreme saltiness, sour, and sweetness you get from their sauces and spices.  That's what it's all about.  As for the service, it's normal to me.  I'm used to them not smiling and kissing my ass because that's not how it's done in any restaurant I visited throughout Asia or back home.  If you want them to cater to you hand and foot, visit a five star restaurant.  Despite their \"attitudes\", they serve quickly, clear the table as you eat, and drink refills come quick, too.    Give it a try and order salt & pepper chicken, their shumai, and their sauteed house noodles (beef and mushroom are good).  I hope that you like it as much as I do.",

We ordered the chef special noodle to share between my wife and I and about 3 dim sum dishes. For dim sum, the dishes were EXPENSIVE (roughly $7-$9 per dish) but what can you expect in Vegas? These dishes would normally cost an avg of perhaps $2-$5 in a normal dim sum joint.  Nothing extremely fancy nor super tasty, but good enough to satisfy the dim sum urge without leaving the vegas strip.",

    "text": "Fresh, handmade noodles served in a very ritzy atmosphere that charges a fortune. The fambam and I came here for dinner just before my return flight to the Bay Area. The decor of the restaurant was very white, and there are A LOT of goldfishes in about six fish tanks standing guard in front of the restaurant.  I ordered a Beijing Style Noodle w/ beef and mushroom in special sauce. It was fifteen bucks for a small single serving of noodles. It would fill up an average person just fine, but my 6\"2' stature was unsatisfied with how little I ate and I devoured copious amounts of chocolate chip cookies at the airport.  Our server Kwok was kind and prompt with our requests. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some good recommendations. Some of the staff however was flat out rude and incompetent. They'd simply set down the dish or cups with a loud clatter and grumpily stalk away.   Nonetheless the small serving of Beijing noodles I got to eat were delicious. Because the restaurant is located inside the Caeser's Palace it must have been absolutely necessary for the prices to go through the roof, but save your money and go else where. If you have a car, drive up Spring Mountain for some good pho houses. There's a couple of Korean BBQ and tofu restaurants that will give you a rich dining experience. You can contribute the money you save for the blackjack tables back at the casinos.",

The cool interior with the white cut out patterns and huge gold fish tank is very modern and chic.   The food is great with hand made pulled noodles and dim sum. The chef was actually hired from China for the restaurant so it's as authentic as you can get by Vegas standards.   As for the service I might have gotten better service being that I speak Cantonese but I'm not sure - either way I never had to ask for my tea to be refilled or anything of sorts since they came around every so often to check up on us.  Overall I'm not sure why this place has gotten such bad reviews but it's yelp and everyone is entitled to their own opinions.",

    "text": "While Beijing boasts the work of an incredible interior design team, (four massive tanks completely filled with goldfish, contemporary furniture, etc.) the actual food and service are subpar on a nuclear level. As someone who considers herself an expert on True Chinese-Vietnamese cuisine, Beijing Noodle No. 9 embarrassed me!  I ordered the cold noodles with cucumber, beansprouts, and beef. What I got was half-cooked, starchy udon-like noodles doused in spicy, watery, mock-szechuan sauce, dehydrated shreds of cucumber, and beef jerky.  YES - they gave me beef jerky. They actually gave me beef jerky with my noodles.  My family ordered variations of the wonton soup because hey, how could you ever mess up wonton soup? Surprise! This place managed to! The soup was obviously made from cheap starch and the noodles had a little more flavor than computer paper. Also, the price range is ridiculous - a bowl of noodles goes from $12 - $22, which is a jaw-dropping difference with authentic places that stay below the $10 mark. It's depressing. And that is where I will end my review on this one.  In the words of my dear father and his experience with Beijing Noodle No. 9:  \"I hate white people noodles. I want Asian people noodles.\"  Just no. Never again. I would rather eat paper towels than return to this wretched place.",

    "text": "Ive eaten at hundreds of Chinese restaurants in my life but I've never seen a place that made their own noddles...until now.  The sight of a smiling chef expertly massaging the dough and then twisting and braiding it into long, rich noodles was something that I had to try.  Not to mention the funky Clockwork Orange meets James Bond interior and Beijing Noodle #9 made an excellent first impression on me.    Once my party was seated an investigation into the menu showed some tried and True favorites along with some more authentic style Chinese dishes that you wont find at your local Chinese joint.  But coming to this place and not getting the noodles would be a sin....Chairman Mao himself would roll in his grave.   So we went safe and got a plate of Chow Mein noodles with Chicken and supplemented it with Kung Pao Shrimp, Salt & Pepper Chicken and Yangzhou Fried Rice.  If the other three dishes were Mercedes Benz's, the Chow Mein noodles were a Rolls Royce.  They were incredible.  Al dente and full of flavor, you know immediately you didnt just put Panda Express in your mouth.   The Kung Pao shrimp had 8-10 huge shrimps in rich sauce with nice spice that wasn't overwhelming.  The salt & pepper chicken was phenomenal with a very light & subtle breading that captured the simpleness of the seasoning.  The fried rice was good but in reality one can't really reinvent the wheel and fried rice tends to fried rice.  A nice touch however is that the rice was blended with vermicelli that gave it a unique consistency.    Overall, the food was excellent and a big step up from run of the mill chinese places.  The fresh, handmade noodles are otherworldly and might be worth the trip alone.  Service is inconsistent but friendly and prices are reasonable, especially given that its in a luxury property on the strip.    I felt like Marco Polo discovering what a noodle was for the very first time....",

Yes it's a bit overpriced (but you are in Las Vegas!!), yes it's noise in the restaurant (but it's a Chinese restaurant) , and yes, the food are spicy, BUT THIS IS AUTHENTIC CHINESE FOOD! They must hire Chinese chef for cooking the authentic Chinese food, and the quality of food is pretty ok! American people if you think you can eat spicy food, think again, carefully. Basically they offer two types of Chinese food: Cantonese food (e.g., dim sum, and BBQ pork) which are not spicy and Sichuan food which may be too spicy for you!

All the dishes cost way more than they're worth. My family ordered the shrimp fried rice, kung pao chicken and shrimp dumplings. Everything was presented poorly and did not look appetizing at all. Just like its visuals, the taste itself matched it. The shrimp fried rice was mediocre, but was the better dish out of the three. The kung pao chicken is NOT recommended. The meat was but into small baby bites and didn't taste authentic at all. The sauce was very watery and didn't hold much flavor and the dish itself was very plan. Just chicken and peanuts here and there. Out of all the kung pao dishes we've had at Chinese restaurants, this has got to be the worst we've ever ordered. The shrimp dumplings came very late -- after we finished both the shrimp fried rice and kung pao chicken. The dumplings looked very dry as if it was sitting out the whole time and it was very salty. Again, save yourself the trouble. If you're looking for a cheaper restaurant, there are more places on the strip!",

I found the restaurant to be 'authentic China tourist'.  What I mean by that is I've visited Beijing and the strange decor and service reminded me of my visit to China.  Yes, the prices are high but that's what I expect dining on the Strip.  My lunch was $30.00 including the glass of Chardonnay.  The fact rice is not included with stir fry type dishes (for lack of a better word) is very odd.  I noticed my fellow diners eating large soup bowls that looked very good.  I will return to this restaurant.  I really liked sitting at the noodle bar and watching the chef.",

The dish was over powered by a buttery taste and the shrimp obviously tasted frozen and not fresh. Totally not worth $30. We also ordered a simple dish like General Tso, which to my surprise, was the only thing that tasted good for its price ($17). Ordered different noodles, like their signature black bean noodle. Was not surprised that it did not please me. Overall, I was dissatisfied with the quality of food, their customer service, and the pricing and portions of their food. Sure, it has to have competative prices, but at least have some good quality food.

But yes it is bad here and unless you are at a high end steakhouse/other fine dining on the strip then usually service isn't the best. Some reviews have stated this is expensive, and I agree and disagree. This is expensive for Chinese food but cheap for Caesars Palace. My meal was $17... at Gordon Ramsey Pub you will be getting two deviled eggs for that price and at Nobu you will be getting hot tea for that price. You are paying for location and a unique food option as the other popular/decent Asian restaurants turn into nightclubs halfway through dinner (Tao and Hakkasan) which is just annoying. SIDE NOTE: if you're looking to get into Tao or Hakkasan nightclub you can skip the line by eating there first and they take you up the back way after dinner. Anyway back to the food, it's ok and worth a try if you keep in mind that it's normal to pay $25 for beef and broccoli because you're inside Caesars Palace.",

The restaurant has a very bright arty white theme going on so it is not a place to visit with a headache.   The food was very good albeit slightly overpriced ($18 for a chow mein) but I would happily recommend it to anyone seeking good Asian food in Caesar's Palace.",

Food (& ratings): - Beef chow fun (2):  I'm giving this dish a 2 though the previous year's experience merited a 4.5.  The beef dish is the only one I am rating b/c it is the only one that all other facets of this bad dining experience stemmed from.     We were about 1/3 through this dish when I noticed that several slices of the beef was RED amidst the noodles.  Ok I enjoy my steak medium rare but not when it comes to something that is supposed to be a stir-fried dish!  Asked waiter, Jimmy (who had an EH attitude all night) to take a look.  Without one word (no apologies on behalf of restaurant) he walked away with dish.    Ten minutes later, he dropped a new dish somewhat resembling beef chow fun onto the table:  beef was in fact cooked but the noodles blended together in a soggy mess.  Most noodles were still stuck together.  Disaster.    Worst part of night?  Besides the terrible attitude, Jimmy charged an EXTRA dish that was not ordered.   Had to send the bill back also.  Inept AND careless?  Oh my, what a horrible dinner.  When: - Christmas 2011  Crowd: - Any within Caesar's hungry enough to venture forth  Interiors & Service: - Interiors (4.5): always liked it - double layered walls & ceiling designed in such a way as to instill underwater feel.  Full goldfish tanks link the entry. - Service (0):  yes, a zero.  Jimmy was terrible, terrible, terrible.    Overall: - Not ever going back",

Makes more sense to get the large bowl to share if you've got a group of people.    Beef tendon and potato stew was surprisingly very tender - though a bit on the salty side, it tastes great with white rice.  The garlic and cucumbers dish was refreshing - though one can't really mess this dish up.  Lan Zhou Hand Pulled Noodles was delicious. Tender beef and   Big plus is that you can order dimsum items any time! (The pork buns were really good - so good I doggie bagged the rest for the plane ride home.)  Prices are slightly (okay not slightly, most defintely incredibly) inflated - well compared to NYC Chinese food prices. However it was welcoming to be able to find comfort food nearby.  Service was nice. Majority of the people were courteous and polite.  They say the wait is long (which is True) - though I'm not 100%s  sure as to why - but I suppose it is to make sure the kitchen can get the food out as fast as people order.    If you a frequent visitor to Caesars Palace - you may want to get one of those VIP cards.  Apparently you can get 10% discount on your bill  - one of the servers was kind enough to inform us of that.",

Get out of here.  Especially when you expect things to be GOOD at a Casino of this caliber.  The food, the chicken... tasted like soggy water.  The vegetables were bland, as if all the flavor was cooked out of them.  Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  If you're in the mood for some Chinese food... find another place, or get some different food, or better yet, save your money and buy a Snickers bar or something at a gas station because you'd be much better off than spending your money at this place.",

After we got our meals he disappeared and didn't return until about 15 minutes after we were done eating. My friend ordered the general tso chicken. It was bland and more breading than chicken. I ordered the chicken and mushroom noodles. The hand pulled noodles were slightly undercooked but still really good. The chicken was horrible and didn't even seem as if it was chicken. The texture was more of the organs than the meat. Needless to say it was very questionable. The experience all together was crappy but our server put the cherry on top when he took the bill and never returned with the change. Normally I tip 20% or above but he seemed ok with his 10%.

It was almost too much like the didn't have any room to swim.  It's well lit and wasn't busy, another red flag. There was an over abundance of waitstaff and the majority of them spoke English poorly. Took a lot time to order and get the food even though it wasn't busy.  We ordered the Hainan chicken, sauteed noodles seafood with abalone sauce, and sauteed snow pea leaves with garlic. The food definitely did not seem authentic and the portions are small. The dishes were exactly what was ordered nothing fancy, nothing more or less.  The only thing I felt was comparable to something worth ordering was the Thai iced tea but even that was overpriced.  I think we ended up spending over $60 dollars on all the above.

I waited around the slot machines but had to keep checking because I wasn't sure if they'd take the effort to look around for me when a table opened up. Decor is beautiful.

    "text": "Sure the place is expensive for Chinese food, but what a good experience we enjoyed.  The hand-stretched noodles were not only fun to watch when they were made but tasted great too.  All of the dishes were on the smaller and somewhat expensive side, but all were freshly made, quickly delivered, and so good we were literally finishing the sauce by swiping our fingers across the plate.  OK, that's an exaggeration... we're much more polite than that... but it was tempting!  The menu is very large and here is enough to make any one, even the pickiest eater, satisfied.  We wish we could have sampled more of the dishes offered!  Service, BTW, was fantastic.  Why not five stars, one might ask -- the price, that's all.  But considering that it is Las Vegas and inside a major hotel that is to be expected.",

    "text": "Egregious. Travesty. Unmitigated gall. If I could give negative stars, I would. The restaurant is staffed with native Chinese servers and presumably cooks. Our server was rather disinterested and standoffish...I imagine it is because she was embarrassed to be associated with such a place and the blatant cash grab that it is.   I have to admit we did not hit it at peak time...it was about 3:30 pm and the place was mostly empty. However, we had just checked in after a tiring day of travel, so at least it was conveniently in the hotel. We also did not get any noodles, though they were being stretched in front of us...I wish we did. The little one usually likes congee, so we chose the congee with century egg and pork ($15!!). Now, I absolutely cannot resist XLB anytime I see them on a menu (even though they are Shanghainese in origin and this was presumably a Beijing restaurant...they also had DanDan noodles, a Szechuan treat. We got the regular pork XLB ($14!) and seafood/pork XLB ($14!). We finished the ordering with some Shiu Mai ($12!), and a $5 diet coke!!! OK, so I thought the prices were rather high (understatement). But I felt the same way at Yank Sing in SF, but at least the food was really good and I didn't feel robbed.  The congee was made from water, not broth, bits of century egg, and a smattering of pork strips. There was nary any salt nor any seasonings of any sort. As a result, it was devoid of any flavor (surprise, surprise). $15 for raw ingredients totalling 25 cents. Both varieties of XLB were off as well...though they both had ample soup, the skins were very tough and discolored a dark hue, as if they had been sitting out awhile. The filling was surprising tough and chewy as well. The four shiu mai were fine, though at $3 a pop, you'd think they had foie gras or truffles in them. Really, nothing different from the 50 to 75 cent version you'd find in any Chinatown. However, the meal was salvaged by the best diet coke I'd ever had, definitely a bargain at $5. Did you catch the sarcasm there? 'cause I was laying it on pretty thick.  So, the total damage for a very mediocre (actually, the food was aspiring to become mediocre) meal was just about $75(!!!). Really, no kidding. Pretty incredible. Run as fast as you can away from this place.",

We had chicken chow mein, won ton soup, dan dan noodles, and veggie fried rice. The hand pulled noodles are ok but I would not spend money on this place every again. Char sio bao is $10 for 3!!!!!! Are you serious?!?! In china town you can get 3 for 2 bucks! Serving size is definitely not like your normal Chinese restaurant. Therefore I suggest getting your own plate.  Service here sucks, and some waitresses speak very little English.   The food comes out as it's cooked, so someone in your party might get their food last when everyone else is done with theirs. Not good!!!! You also have to be quick and attentive to them if and when they come around, otherwise they will take your plates away when your not even done!   Hope your dining experience is better than mine was.....",

    "text": "I saw the reviews, but figured I'll take a chance because of all the pretty goldfish tanks. I regret not listening to the reviews.   Food was on the expensive side, but only mediocre. I've had better at mall food courts, but maybe this place is healthier or something. Waitstaff seemed pleasant, however seemed unknowledgable about the menu and were slow. I asked for a recommendation and the waiter just kind of struggled. Food came out irregular and slow, which was odd considering half the room was empty. My dad got the duck soup which came out first. He finished eating the soup, and then we sat and waited for everyone else's food to come out. Portions were small, no one in my family came out full. Also rice is not included on entrees?   And the crab fiasco. My mom wanted to get the crab but we wanted to check the market price. We asked the same waiter and everyone at the table all heard $16.99. When we got the bill it was $59.99. To be fair there was a possibility that we heard the waiter wrong (plus he had an accent), but I doubt it. Looking back I was more shocked than upset, but the crab price was just a \"nice\" topping to a bad dinner and service. We felt we were deceived and now this mediocre dinner was definitely not worth it. I talked to the manager and she was quite understanding and took off some of the price of the crab. When signing the bill, she had to clean off the table so I had space to put down the bill, just to show how incompetent the waiters were.   This place was a waste of time and money. Pleasant decor though.",

Felt this was a nice touch and it mixed well with the ceiling decor, which was two ( 2 ) layers of multi design, with lights that made for a dazzeling sight. I am a Northeast  ( meat and potatoes man), and seldom change  or try different ethnic food. I do enjoy the Chinese Shrimp & Broccoli dish of which I tried. It is by far the best Shrimp & Broccoli that I have ever had. The broccoli was perfectly done, a bit crunchy , which is how I like it. The Shrinp were excelent, and the saice was and added plus for the meal. The white rice ia white rice, and it was hot. I had hot tea and when I pouredthe tea into my cup there wwere a lot of tea leaves that came out. I think that this was done for an effect? I found that the service was a bit lacking. I felt like no one cared if I were there to eat, or not. The manager did come to the table when i was done to find out how things were. My over-all rating is a 3 star manely due to the warmth of the staff. If the rest of the food is as good as the shrimp & Broccoli, then I would recommend BN &9.",

I was told that Caesar's Palace has one of the big cocktail drinks that everyone seemed to be carrying around in the street and there I got stuck in search of the damn drink. I started to get hungry and came across a bright white restaurant with ridiculous gold fish tanks. I was told that they hand roll their noodles and make their dumplings, so I convinced our party to stop by for lunch. Oof. Big mistake! We ordered the Beijing noodles, seafood noodle soup, Shanghai dumplings, and kungpao shrimp. All of them were complete misses. I am not sure if it was just us, but we completely failed on all our dishes. It might have been just a coincidence, but I think not. I think this place just sucks. It is overpriced for such a noodle shop and I have been lured in by the damn fish tanks. Damn it! And for those reviewers who gave 5 stars, what the hell did you eat? And what have you eaten all your life? Dog food?",

If you are inside the Caesar Palace or in the vicinity and want chinese food, go to this place instead of the chinese place at the Forum food court. The food is pretty good. The specialty item is the handpull noodle with different topping, with the pork/mushroom as being the most popular. I did try that and was happy with it. I do eat in the San Gabriel valley a lot and I think this place is pretty good. The food cost anywhere from $9-$30 per dish, which is still cheaper than any other sit down chinese restaurants at the Bellagio, The Aria, or the Wynn. Red 8 at the Wynn is probably the best casual asian/chinese in the casino though.",

I went there expecting to see the noodle being pulled and made, since it is a noodle shop, but unfortunately the bar by the noodle maker was closed.  As a noodle lover and homemade noodle creator, it would have been awesome to see how they made it.  As the name of the place implies, Beijing Noodle No. 9.  You should only go for noodles here.  Handmade noodles goes best with beef stew (usually hong sao.)  But the broth here was different.  It was not spicy, not too salty, lightly sprinkled with cilantros and scallions.  The noodles were excellent and worth the taste experience.  As i mentioned before homemade noodles goes best with beef broth and the flavor and amount was perfect.  Everything else at this place, I skipped because of my own built in homemade noodle bias.",

This was the only saving grace, knowing we were doing some good.  The meal started with seafood soup, which was nothing special.  Next was cantonese style roast duck.  Not sure what cut of the bird this was, but it was mostly bone with a little meat.  It was served with cold marinated bamboo shoots.  These were interesting because i have never had them before, but again, nothing special.  The main course was scallops and asparagus.  I think the sauce was just oyster sauce, very salty and a little greasy, but the scallops were nicely cooked.  For dessert i had mango and pumalo in a mango custard.  This was pretty good.  Overall, the whole meal was just ok.  I have had way better meals for this price during restaurant week in the past.  Not sure how a mediocre chinese restaurant can stay in buisness in a city like Vegas with all the exceptional restaurant options.  Would not recomend.  Oh yeah, i should mention that i didn't choose the restaurant, we were with a group.  I wouldn't have chosen to come here in the first place, because why eat chinese food when you could have thai!?",

Once you order, they take the fresh noodles and cook then for you.  But here's the downside: the price!  Because they are located in Caesar's Palace, this place is incredibly expensive.  On my own I probably wouldn't have eaten here, (thank you work for my meal per diem.)  The noodles were ok and the dish I ordered came with some beef (which was rubbery and bland) in some broth.  The noodles themselves ended up being kind of bland, since the overall dish didn't have much flavor.  I also ordered some pork buns which were really good.  They took a while to come out because they are steamed fresh when you order them.  I'll say though for hand pulled noodles, you can probably do better off the strip in Vegas in a hole-in-the-wall type of place.  But if you've got some extra cash and looking to try something  different, check out this place.

The chicken and mushroom soup was just broth, chunks of chicken, and mushrooms.  Although the mushrooms were tasty, the soup itself didn't have a lot of flavor.  The beef dumplings were good (6 for $11) but pretty small.  I've had dumplings in San Francisco before that were twice the size.  The noodle and sauce was okay.  Again, the portion was very small.  With those items and an iced tea, the bill was ~$45 + tip.  We were both still hungry after our meal but considering the small portion sizes and prices, we decided to get a snack later. Our waitress was very nice, and kept our iced tea and water filled.  The decor is very unique.  It was also fun watching the noodle makers.  Those were the only good points.

    "text": "Our family went to this place on Christmas day, 2009.  We ordered six different dishes, some soup, some noodle, some chicken dishes.  Seafood noodle had one shrimp and one squid and one green vegi on top of noodle.  Supposed to be hand made noodle, but the texture was bad.  The food didn't have enough flavor, seasoning, it tasted like nothing. My five year old could make something like that. Some dishes was just too salty and some were just too blend.  We also had to put some soy sauce to eat the noodle.  I made a mistake going to this place without reading reviews.   The place looks fancy but food is awful. Food was also expensive compare to what you get. I've never had this awful tasting chinese food in my entire life. Just plain bad, period. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!  YUK... if I could give none star, I would....  I wonder how this place can stay in business....",

    "text": "First let me start off by saying that the people here are SUPER nice, super attentive service, and very helpful in suggesting something for me to try that's new.  If you order water, you'll find they give you a tiny glass, but no worries- you'll never see the bottom of your glass.  Someone will always come by to make sure it's full no matter how thirsty you are.  That alone is kind of entertaining to see!  But my review is for the food and it is not that great, I've given this place two shots and both times they have disappointed me.  The tastes here are very bland and boring.  It's too expensive to try it again for a third time regardless that I come to Caesars a lot for their spa and shopping.  On a more positive note, the goldfish are really cool.  There's something about watching fish swim that's relaxing. :-)  It's silly but the fish are the only reason I came back to give this place a second try, atmosphere is important, the taste of the food is more important.  Blah.",

You can get these in any Chinatown at a half of the price, and they are tastier and more authentic. Nothing special about the noodle and the broth, and the beef was a bit tough. As for the soup dumplings, they didn't have any \"soup\" inside at all. But overall, like I said, the food was not good, but not terribly bad either. The worst part was actually their service! The only nice thing was their decor.",

    "text": "We ended up there because our 24-hour-buffet deal was about to expire in 1 hour and the line at the Caesar Palace buffet was about a 2 hour wait.  We had made a really bad choice!  I would give the gold fish tanks and the modern design a 5-star, but we were not there for the decorations.  The so-called hand-stretched noodles were not chewy at all!  Tasted like it had been soaked in the soup for a long time.  My daughter ordered beef noodle.  They didn't not have a chili symbol next to it to denote spicy food.  When the food came, there was a layer of chili oil floating on top.  I asked the waitress and all she said was \"Only a little, not spicy\" and left.   That was pretty subjective.   We had asked no eggs on the fried rice and it came with eggs!  Both the noodle and the rice were too salty.  The only OK food was the scallion pancakes. They still can't compete to the Chinese restaurants in the Asian communities in Los Angeles.  Good thing they were in Vegas where there would be cravings of semi-authentic Chinese food after eating too much buffet and the wanna-be Asian food in the Asian section.  To sum up my experience, this restaurant has pricy mediocre food that came in small portions.",

The two noodle dishes were ok - a bit overpriced but it's a vegas hotel restaurant so i accepted it.  The two apps we got were soup dumplings and some beef patty bun thing.  Both were horrible.  The soup dumplings didn't have any soup.  The beef patty buns were tasteless.  But the worst dish was the entree.  We got the Spicy chicken dish (the one that comes with peanuts).  AWFUL!  The chicken was DRY and overall, the dish was very bland in flavor.  I suggest just trying the noodle if you really want to stop in.  There are better places to eat on the strip for the price!",

    "text": "We went here for lunch. The decor was pretty cool, although I thought there were too many fish in the aquarium (on one of the press clippings outside the restaurant it said you could choose your own fish to eat - I hope they weren't talking about these cute little gold fish). As for the food we shared a small bowl of noodles with pork and mushrooms ($15), steamed pork buns ($10) and Vietnamese iced coffee ($6). The noodles were I guess hand made and actually quite tasty, but there was barely anything else in the bowl....just some sweet sauce, 2-3 slices of mushroom and 2-3 pieces of shredded pork/dried bacon. The buns were average - edible but nothing special. The coffee was good. The most exciting part of the meal was the fire...so midway through our lunch fire alarm went off. At first we thought it was just a test so we did not pay much attention to it and neither did anyone else (we experienced fire alarm test at Harrah's the day before). But then we heard overhead announcement saying \"please evacuate the building\" so we asked the waitress what was going on and she said \"don't worry, this happens all the time\". What, they have daily evacuations!? I don't think she understood the announcement so we asked her to please go outside and check it out (we were somewhat concerned, but apparently not so motivated to check it out ourselves). She came back reporting that everything was ok, but that we were free to leave if we wanted. No one else budged from their seats and so comforted by the crowd mentality we stayed. A few minutes later there was another announcement saying that fire had been contained and to return to our normal activity. So much for fire alarms.",

    "text": "We were there this past weekend.  When I first tried the Braised beef noodle, it was actually OK.  My wife and I decided to go back for lunch the next day.  I ordered the same noodle - was disappointed because they made such a big deal about my request for egg noodle (which is what I ordered the day before).  They kept asking me who waited on us the day before.  Apparently, they try to discourage the customers from picking which type of noodle they preferred.  The chef disagreed with my choice and they were pushing for the hand-made spring noodle.  I went through 3 servers (who were extremely rude) until they figured out who waited on us the day before.  Naturally, I was upset and basically lost my appetite.  I don't know if they did it on purpose but the soup base tasted like it was watered-down.  No flavor at all as compared to the day before.  I told our server about all the hassle because of my request and she explained that the chef gives them a hard time if they request on behalf of the customer a different noodle.  It turns out, their chefs come directly from Northern China and they do not like it when customers want egg noodle in their soup (which I guess is Cantonese style from the Southern part of China - according to the waitress).  Anyway, long story short - the first few servers were very rude.  They had to get permission from the manager AND the chef if it was OK for me to pick which noodle I wanted for my soup.  To top it off, they were not consistent with the flavor.  Should have gone to Noodles at Bellagio.",

When you walk in, precariously positioned into forming an aisle, are several fish tanks of small goldfish.  Lots of goldfish. As in thousands of goldfish and nothing else.  No little underwater scuba diver figurine blowing bubbles.  Or rocks to dart in and out of. Or plastic weeds. Just thousands upon thousands of goldfish.   Then there was the hostess...dressed in orange. The walls and ceiling resembling an aquarium. And the lighting, making it seem you were part of the whole goldfish spectacle.  While you're looking around, scouring your memory banks to recall if you've ever seen anything this weird without having first ingested a generous quantity of  LSD, a waiter dressed with orange fish buttons will appear.  He'll suggest ordering their hand-stretched noodles, but don't. Eating these flavorless 'things' will only dredge up bad memories of when you were in college, eating ramen like it was your job. Now you're curious.  This whole thing is too weird..it has to be a setup...a camera crew about to come running out of the kitchen to inform you how you've just been punk'd.  But sadly, there's no producer...or crew.  Just your fish-buttoned waiter, the orange hostess, and your date, who's incessantly jabbering about how cool this place is.  What does she know?  She ordered the rice cakes and green tea.   If you do get suckered into this place by the Chinese guy in the window hand stretching the noodles, you're in for a good sized check and a disappointed palette.  On your way out, stop and check-out the goldfish tank for any tits-up floaters.  The orange hostess will look at you like your crazy. Screw her.  She's the one dressed in orange.",

I told the server I just sat down and wanted to browse the menu a little. The guy told me he wanted to know what I was going to eat. Again I told him I wanted some time to look over the menu. He left for less than 30 seconds, returned with my water and iced tea and was very pushy with asking what I wanted to eat. I ordered beef chow mein. He brought it to me in less than 5 minutes.   It was not very exciting. It came on a small plate and the portion was tiny. I usually don't need to add any soy sauce to my food when I eat out, but I had to add a lot. Not much flavor at all! The beef was tender, but the noodles were mushy. My server never returned to refill my beverage ($5 for iced tea) or my luke warm water.   *$18 for chow mein- was excepting great things at that price since a mile down the road in China Town I can get hand pulled fresh made noodles for less than $10.  *$5 for iced tea- which should have been refilled but he didn't come around to refill me. *Waited 15 min after emptying my plate for my bill.  *I was still really hungry!! :(  Yes they make all things in house, but so do many other Chinese places in town. Their menu is over priced for what you get (shumai is $10 for 4 small pieces).   DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!",

Absolutely, but you've also got to expect that from the STRIP.  Also,  you can tell the experience of the chefs because the food is more delicate than your typical hole in the wall chinese that they're being compared to.    That being said,  we arrived on 930pm when they close at 1030pm.  Important to get there earlier as they stop taking people around this time.  We made it just in time.  I saw the hostess turn people away at 10pm.  Anyway,  we had the shanghai soup dumplings,  sauteed pea tips, dan dan mian, chicken broth with hand pulled noodles, chinese pancake with beef, jellyfish salad, hot sour soup and pot stickers.    Warning, the dan dan noodles are super spicy and salty, so just know this before you order.  None of the food was bad.  It was tasty, but not the best chinese I've ever had. But will satisfy the chinese craving.  The sauteed veggies were well done and not overcooked.    Hand pulled noodles were chewy and delish.  The soup dumplings were very good, so we had to add another order.  All in all,  if I wanted noodles or chinese and didn't want to leave the hotel,  I would eat here.  The service was fine.  Typically I have fairly low standards for service at asian establishments.  You know you're doing for food,  not the service.  Have that expectation in mind and you won't leave angry at any asian establishment.  Just a tip.",

Friends ordered the dao xiao (handcut) noodles with egg and tomato--I liked that the best. + Jimmy our waiter was cordial and funny. He helped the lost ones at our table to make their decisions.

Think modern white but lots of curly Qs and glass tanks of goldfish swirling everywhere around you. It's dizzying but fantastical!  The -'s: - Forget the dimsum or sides.

Uhh.. I don't have anything else to say about this restaurant except for the high price and just okay food that is not worth it. That's the only memorable things about this restaurant haha :P OHH! they have lots of gold fish in the aquarium in front of the restaurant haha :)",

Beijing Noodle No.9 offers selections of soup, dim sum, noodle and rice dishes and chef's specialties. Unfortunate, I ordered the dumpling and wonton noodle soup, basic dishes & my business associates ordered brisket beef noodle soup. All dishes were not flavorful. Especially my broth was plain. The dumpling was really dry inside.   Wish we could have gone to to Noodle @ the Bellagio or RED8 @ the Wynn.   Service was attentive and on point. Love the gigantic fish tanks!",

When the food came out, the server called out the dish differently than what it was on the menu. So of course we looked confused. We also ordered spicy salted shrimp and got Kong Pao shrimp. By that time, we just wanted to finish our meal and get out. The food was salty and not as satisfying as expected. Our waters were not filled until after we \"asked\" for our checks and did I mention the food were overly salty? so yes our water were gone quick. And we waited for a good 10 minutes before signaling someone down for the check. We went there purposely to get the hand pulled noodles and expected a show but instead it was pre pulled; Which we understand how much of a hassle it would be to pull noodle per order. Other than that the gold fish were beautiful! I hope they read their reviews and change things up a little bit.",

    "text": "This is really one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in Las Vegas.    I was really hungry and on a Sunday afternoon at Ceasers Palace food options are a bit limited because most restaurants close for the afternoon and reopen in the evening.   So I arrived and the hostess lady said all the tables are full and that I had to wait 10-20 minutes.  She then gave me one of those vibrating alarm things that would go off when a table becomes available and she was like, \"Make sure you stay within 10 ft, so we can reach you.\"  Not sure what the whole point of the alarm is if you can't walk father than 10 feet from the restaurant....  Anyways, finally, after about 30 minutes of standing right next to the hostess, the alarm goes off and she guides me to a table in a clearly and completely EMPTY restaurant. I was a bit thrown off because it's just not nice to be lied to and certainly not nice to be kept waiting for no apparent reason.  By the time I sit down, I'm completely famished and order 2 dishes, one noodle broth and another scallops over noodles.  This is when the most ridiculous part happens...the food didn't come for another 45 minutes!  I'm not sure why it takes so long to make noodles in a completely empty restaurant.  Knowing that food options were a bit limited at the Caesars palace on a Sunday afternoon, I had no choice but to just sit there and wait.  While waiting, I ordered a coke and no...it didn't come immediately, but after another 10 minutes.  When the waitress brought me the coke, it was a can and straw, and I had to ask her for a glass so I can pour it in.   When the food came, the \"hot\" noodles were cold (which is not surprising considering the 45 minute wait), and the \"scallops\" were falling apart and in pieces.  I had always thought scallops are in round cylindrical shapes.  Not at this restaurant!  The minute you touch them, they fell apart, which was a bit disappointing but understandable as long as they taste good.   Unfortunately, they did not taste good.  In fact, they tasted a bit foul...and let's just say I was a bit sick for the rest of the day and could barely leave my hotel room.    Two noodle dishes and a coke, came to about $50-$60....and all this waiting just so I can spent an entire afternoon and evening food sick in my hotel room bathroom.    It was so not worth it....",

    "text": "As you would expect from a place as ornate as Caesar's Palace, this has to be the prettiest Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. Its gleaming bright white is festooned with paisley-like cut-outs to give oh-so-subtle silhouette patterns from floor to ceiling (see photos). If you ask me, it's a little too white, sort of like a scene from George Lucas' \"THX 1138\" (sorry for the geek sci-fi reference). The only real color comes courtesy of the thousands of goldfish inhabiting the oblong tanks along the entryway. It's quite a sight since you're never quite sure if they are there for decoration or as a potential appetizer.   Yet, even when you're seated, the white-on-white decor makes you feel like everyone is staring and your fly is open. Jamie W. and I quickly buried our heads into the menus. We decided to share two dishes, both extravagantly priced - the $20.09 Steamed Scallops and Vermicelli with Garlic and the $16.09 Braised Pork with Rice Noodle Beijing Style (see photos). Note the artificial use of the number 9 in their prices to reflect their name. Anyway, when the dishes came out, we were both startled at how decidedly mediocre they looked and tasted. It was like watching a supermodel wearing a stunning outfit only to discover she was wearing dirty panties underneath.   The scallops were not terrible, just paltry (only six served) and bland with an incompatible pile of transparent pasta underneath. The braised beef dish, however, was deplorable. Whether the noodles were homemade or not, they looked like the kind of thick chow mein you would get at a bad suburban take-out joint. Again, the meat portion was paltry, and there was nothing to indicate it had been braised more than sitting in a wok for far too long. Not only the food was disappointing, but the service was surly and the hostess had attitude. Perhaps there were too many high-rollers who didn't leave tips.   FOOD - 2 stars...mediocre and pricey, a deadly combination  AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...like I said, pretty white-on-white decor with lots of goldfish  SERVICE - 2 stars...why the sour face?  TOTAL - 2 stars...take a pass and go to Noodles in the Bellagio...better food with a smile",

She also tried to claim that my dish, a Combo Chow Mein, took a long time to prepare, when the man sitting next to me ordered the EXACT same thing after, ate, and left before I even saw my food. The man on the table to my right experienced the same issue.  At no point were either of us issued an apology, only excuses. Avoid this place like a duck shaped scar on the earth swimming in a broth that tastes oddly like fish.",

    "text": "The interior decor is beautiful. I really liked the ambiance of this place.  I like the fact that you can watch them hand pull noodles towards the front of the restaurant by the entrance. They also have several fish tanks that adds a splash of vibrant color from the otherwise contrasting white decor.  The food is freshly prepared, but overpriced compared to your typical Chinese restaurant, but what isn't in Vegas?   They have a rather extensive menu to entice just about anyone.  -Lead by Executive Chef Li Yu. -Attire is casual. -Average price of an entree is approximately $25.   These are the following dishes I've ordered at Beijing Noodle No.9: (2 adults, 2 children) Ordered far too much. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs..evidently.  -Special Seafood Soup (one size) $113.99/ individual bowl. (The flavors were very \"clean\", but too bland in my opinion.)  -Braised Sea Bass in a sizzling clay pot $23.99   -Walnut Prawns in Mayo Sauce $20.99 (I actually really enjoyed this dish, the prawns were huge, fried to perfection, and absolutely succulent.)   -Beef Chow Fun $16.99  -Braised Beef Brisket & Tendon Noodle Soup $16.99 (you can choose what kind of noodle to have it with. I opted for the more traditional choice for this dish; hand pulled/ stretched noodles.)  -War Wonton Noodle Soup $16.99 (This was a very ordinary dish that I wouldn't order again.)  -Green Onion Pancake $7.99 (I requested for it to be extra crispy which was delightful.)  -Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings Pork (6 pieces) $12.99 (I definitely prefer Din Tai Fung's XLB)   -Pork and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $10.99   -Shrimp and Chives Dumplings (Boiled or Pan-Fried, 6 pcs.) $12.99 (I opted for Pan Fried for both orders.)   -Seafood & Egg White Fried Rice $16.99 (Ordered this in lieu of white rice, it complemented the other dishes very well)  -Seasonal Mushrooms w. Black Pepper Sauce $15.99 (I was quite disappointed when this came out with mainly white mushroom.)   -Pea Leaves w. Golden Garlic $19.99 (Paired well with the fried rice mentioned above.)   -4 Thai Iced Teas $6.99 each, we added boba (bubble, pearls etc.) but I forget how much extra they charged.   -Sichuan Dan Dan Mien $15.99 (I believe we ordered this with the knife-shredded noodles to change it up a bit.)   -Beijing Pancake Wrap with Cilantro (1) (Beef or Honey BBQ Pork) $8.99 (We opted for Beef, and if I remember correctly we all enjoyed it.)  I know I'm missing a few dishes, but I think it's safe to say that I pretty much ordered something from each section/ category on the menu. We ate \"family style\" and shared so everyone gets more choices, making this review easier. The food portions were fair, the food didn't taste bad, but it was more Americanized to be completely honest. I can see why the reviews for this restaurant is all over the place; it is overpriced, and didn't taste necessarily \"authentic\".   Service wise: We were seated quickly, and the servers were friendly and attentive.   Overall, it's a nice concept, but not a restaurant I'd ever crave. I do agree with other reviews that it's overpriced, but again, we are talking about Vegas. Everything is overpriced in Vegas.. maybe we're paying for the experience. Will I return, possibly, but it wouldn't be my choice. I'd go if someone else wanted to eat there. Personally, I'd rather eat at Bacchanal Buffet next door because there's definitely something for everyone, at one set price.",

    "text": "Hello and welcome to Beijing Noodle No. 9. I bordered on a 2 or 3 rating but stuck with the 3. We were greeted and sat near the Kitchen where we could see the staff hard at work. We waited about 10 minutes to get someone to recognize that we were actual customers who just got seated. Ten Minutes already in negative status. Finally got our drink order and an appetizer ordered. Steamed BBQ pork Buns. Bland and sticky. Not what i have ever experienced in past Noodle houses. We then ordered Shrimp fried rice Hand pulled soup noodle with Chicken. The decor here is all white almost 3D in its appearance to the eye. Floors were very dirty and ambiance was very loud. As we waited for our food a large table was sat order taken in a language I did not speak and not soon after and before our food arrived they were receiving dishes. Thought that to be odd. Our food finally arrived. I can't speak to the goodness of the food as it was bland. We were going to a show so it seemed like an easy stop on the way. Too many good or excellent noodle shops in this town to put this even on a list.  Thank you for dining at Beijing Noodle No. 9. I can't say I will go here again. They will not miss my business. Not sure they really even wanted it to begin with. If you are a tourist in Caesars and are looking for an almost quick bite before a show at a reasonable price I guess you could try it. But if you are a local, I can suggest dozens more noodle shops worth the visit.",

Bad:  Food and service was hit and miss.  My hot and sour soup was excellent; main dish, not as much.  Wait person never seemed to be around when we needed her.  Ugly:  They have shark fin on the menu.  Shame!  I took away one star on my review  My advice:  Poke your head in and admire the decor for a minute or two, then move along to Mesa Grill.",

Initially, all I could think about was the cool decorations.  There are columns and sections of wall filled with water and real goldfish.  The ceiling and the floor matched the contemporary, watery-fish decoration so it's almost like sitting in a room that Michael Jackson considers his \"fishy room.\"  A little off-putting but still very cool.  The food itself was excellent.  I cannot rave enough about the Kung Pao Chicken which is easily the best item on the menu.  That dish contains all white meat and hardly any fat.    I feel like a perverse old man describing an Olsen twin but oh well.  My co-workers ordered several other somewhat mainstream Chinese dishes and they were solid.  The restaurant also offers sushi but it was mediocre at best.  Beijing Noodle is expensive but it's Vegas and I challenge you to find a cheaper on-strip restaurant.  The wait staff was very nice and responsive, I don't think I had to ask for more water once in my 5 or 6 visits.  But because it's so easily accessible to Caesars Palace patrons, it can get pretty busy at times so make a reservation or else you'll be waiting a few minutes for a table.",

Yeah, it is a little steep (nothing crazy), but maybe these people forgot that they were at one of the premier casinos on the middle of the Strip in a little town called Las Vegas - which is not exactly where you go for bargains on food. That aside, I was not overly impressed with the food, but it was solid and the ingredients were quality. The menu is crazy-extensive, so there are many dishes to come back to - if you can get past the price point. The atmosphere is really impressive, but a bit sterile. (The gold fish are awesome.) I read multiple problems with the service, but I did not have any problems on my visit - I was seated promptly and the service was attentive. Will I go back? With a Chinatown's worth of options a mere few miles away, probably not. Yet, if I was on the Strip and had a taste for Chinese, sure.",

Positives: 1) Server was prompt and good at her job. 2) We were sat almost immediately, surprising for a Friday night at 6pm. 3) My shredded pork entree had a nice spice to it.  Negatives: 1) Sat us at the bar right in front of the restaurant, area hadn't been properly cleaned, water glass still remaining and bar top needed wiped. Server cleaned this with a dry paper towel - should have left then. 2) Wife ordered beef n broccoli. Both meals came out quickly, however she found various uncooked beef gelatin in hers, as well as parts still being cold. 3) We both ordered brown instead of white rice - not knowing it would be an additional $10 each for roughly a cup of rice until we received our bill. 4) Most importantly, including our area, the bar/kitchen was in need of cleaning. The ceiling over where they make the pasta (including ceiling lights and camera) were filthy, with large visible dust accumulation. Also, the divider between bar and kitchen visibly hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in quite some time.  We debated between this and Searsucker, and boy, lots of regret on our part - sorry Caesar's, do better.",

    "text": "I did not go here by choice.  In fact I was completely opposed to going here and was on my way to another establishment, but I was semi-forced to go here by the group I was with.  Big mistake on both fronts, especially since I already saw the yelp reviews...  Overpriced, even for Vegas.  Most dishes were in the $18-$20 range and were nothing special.  My chicken mushroom noodles were actually decent noodles, but everything else was bland and sort of greasy.  How do they have all that grease/oil and not much flavor?  The service was decent, but not great (I realize sometimes you are paying for service at places like this, but the service wasn't very good, not rude or dismissive or anything like that, just not great).  The interior is pretty nice I guess, so at least there is something to look at.  I tried another dish and it was also bad.  It was really fishy and even the shrimp wasn't good.  It was some seafood wonton soup.  The wontons were pretty good, but the rest of the dish including the noodles and the brother were yuck!  I will never return, but I will return to Cesars in Las Vegas.  Even if I am with a group who wants to go here, I will make up an excuse to go gamble and not attend.  I don't mean for this review to be hateful in any way.  I just don't think this restaurant tries very hard and there is no excuse for the prices being so high.  Do yourself a favor and head next door to Earl of Sandwich or venture into the forums shops and go to cheesecake factory.  I heard Gordon Ramsay's isn't bad and they have a great selection of craft beer.",

We naively thought the buffet line would be reasonable during the weekend. Oops... 0_0  These poor folks are the closest restaurant that will do during lunch or early dinner (as I call \"linner\").   They're scrutinized big time since we cannot enter the Bacchanal. Because of that I chose to review them much later.   Now w/all that being said, I think it's par to give them 3 stars.  I agree w/most concerning the prices. There's nothing special about their food except for their convenience.   The food was edible but if you're starving, anything dead will do. My beef chow foon (same as drunken noodle) tasted as it should and his kung pao chicken was flavored properly. We looked at each other and said \"3 stars\".   Memorable bites were from the green onion pancakes but I'm partial to fried carbs.   Finally we give kudos to the line hostess. She asked each small group if they'd like to sit at the front bar stool section when any opened up. We took the offer to jump the line.   Lesson learned regarding the wait time for the famous Bacchanal buffet.",

We had to wait in between huge tanks of goldfish which had LOTS of dead and dying fish. I had to keep looking down at the ground because it was starting to disgust me. From that moment I had a bad feeling about this place.   We were sat at a table and someone came to get our drink order. Then 3 more people proceeded to come and try to take our drink order. Obviously there was no system or communication going on there. When the drinks came, one was missing, another had two straws in it and another drink didn't have a straw. This was so dumb it was laughable.   A waitress came to take our order and when we tried to order salt and pepper shrimp, she said they were out of shrimp so we ordered other dishes. But while trying to order the waitress would stop listening and start talking to someone else in the middle of us ordering!! To no surprise when our order came out there were things missing! Also, our noodles had shrimp which they said they were out of?! Food sucked and nobody came to check on us. We had to flag down someone to give us and the tables around us our checks.   I don't know how this place stays open with such horrible service and tasteless food. Worst place I've ever been to in my 20 years of living in Vegas.",

    "text": "The food was excellent!  Why did this place get such low stars?  First of all the soup dumplings were hot steamy and juicy!  The noodles were freshly made there. We had beef ribs that were spiced perfectly by chinese or American standards. Beef noodle soup that reminded me of growing up in Taipei Taiwan. The wonton soup was light and flavorful w al dente perfect wonton skin. The staff was slower slightly slower. Not sure why the receptionist made us wait 10 min when there were many empty tables. This is the only reason I would have given them 4 stars. Perhaps they were trying to make us go to the buffet ten steps down?  My only regret is not eating here on our first day here at Caesars Palace.",

    "text": "Despite observing numerous negative Yelp reviews--often railing about lacking value for a high monetary outlay--I had long wanted to dine here to see for myself.  Since Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a Strip restaurant, the high prices should not be surprising.  And, noting that ratings for food had recently risen, I at last ventured out to see for myself.  And I'm glad I did.  Because food and service were mostly excellent, including perhaps the best Shrimp Chow Mein I have experienced.     We began with Har Gow Shrimp Dumplings, which arrived in a bamboo basket.  With a slightly sticky and jiggly exterior when touched, and a delicious hot shrimp center, this was a filling and satisfying starter.  Next up was a bowl of Seafood Hot & Sour Soup.  It was heat hot and very good, but with clusters of Black Trumpet Mushrooms and cut up scallops, somewhat unusual.  The portion supplied was that of a small bowl but adequate.  Because the soup was not too spicy, the flavors came through nicely.  Honey Walnut Prawns were superlative, with a mayonnaisey dressing that was amply applied and sweet, but not cloyingly so.  And the eight crustaceans were clearly large prawns--not mere shrimps.  It was amazing that Diane was able to consume the entire entree in one sitting.  I also barely finished all of my Shrimp Chow Mein which was studded with medium-sized shrimps embedded in delicious swirls of homemade noodles.  From habit I reached for the Soy Sauce, but then withdrew it as I began tasting Chow Mein Noodles that were already perfectly oiled in soy.  Once all noodles and shrimp had disappeared in my gullet, I finished with an ice cold Mochi Sampler: a tasty trio of Mango, Strawberry, and Green Tea Ice Cream.  The overworked hostess was all business but very professional.  I observed that she had to reset tables besides entertain reservations and seat hungry diners.  We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation time, and were seated within 5 minutes of arrival.    Service, too, was excellent.  Dishes came out quickly and accurately, and water glasses and a pot of hot and fragrant Jasmine Tea were refilled without request.  While the feel of the restaurant is cool rather than warm, with a scalloped cut out ceiling and walls, and sleek but contemporary tables and chairs, this ambiance fits well with the watery environment of the goldfish-filled aquariums that lead into the dining room.  Calling it as I experienced my single outing, XXXX-1/2 stars overall!",

    "text": "I came here on NYE at about 8:45 and the hostess quoted me an hour wait! Understandable since the other restaurants around are either all booked or only doing $100 prefixe menus lol. However, we only waited for about 20 mins! I honestly think they always say the wait is about an hour bc they don't know how to give an approximate wait time..   TIP: if there's a line, make sure to check in with the hostess before getting in line!! A lot of people around me did not know that they needed to check in and just got in line.   Anyway, between the three of us, we ordered: Soup dumplings: I liked the filling but the skin was a little thick. Not worth the price. Mini wontons in spicy sauce: my fav of the night! Perfect bite sized pieces. My friend wished it was spicier though Hot and sour soup: pretty standard Yang Zhou fried rice: honestly looks v bland and I was hesitant on ordering but it was better than I thought and a little bit of pepper fixed it for me Beef chow fun: i love chow fun but not this one :(  General Tso's Chicken: my boyfriend thought it was really good but I thought the sauce was a little weird. Too thick. It was on the sweeter side as well. Scallops in XO sauce: the asparagus that comes with this is cooked really well! My other favorite dish :)  The portions are rather large in my opinion. Wish they could be smaller at a lower price point bc I like variety but don't like wasting food :/   Also, they had no more live seafood when we came (boo!!) no lobster, crab, or even sea bass   Service was a little slow but nice. it was busy so that's understandable.   I don't get why the ratings are so low here! (Originally deterred me but again, I did not want a $100 pre fixe menu from the other restaurants around)",

She pointed out that 1 side of the dumplin's are fried which means they ARE fried. Okaaayy.  My husband had the Stir fried beef with vegetables and garlic. The vegetables consisted of huge chunks off bell peppers.  The beef looked really nice but it had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever. I ordered the Beijing noodles with chicken and mushroom. It was OK. Just OK. Nothing special.   We ate here 2 years ago and the food was very good with amazing flavors. Not sure what happened to this place. On a side note: Do not expect great service. It was borderline rude.",

Rates closer to 3.5 stars with decent food and service, but don't have any desire to return so landing at 3 stars.  We ordered:    * Shanghai soup dumplings with pork:  Thick doughy skin; neither the soup nor the dumpling had much flavor.  Only plus was there was lots of soup.  2/5  * Roast duck:  standard roast duck like you would get at any Chinese supermarket.  3/5  * Beijing pancake wrap with cilantro:  we got the honey BBQ pork version instead of the more traditional sliced beef shank, which was an excellent choice since the BBQ pork lent it a lovely sweet texture.  There was also a copious amount of pork in the dish; only the oiliness of the pancake and the spareness of greens prevented it from a perfect score.  4.5/5  * Singapore rice vermicelli with curry:  Standard rendition though the shrimp and pork tasted fresh.  Spiciness was on the mild side but it was there.  3/5  Overall an okay place for Chinese food if you're in Caesar's but there are better options out there.",

I ended up here thanks to Anthony Bourdain who praised this venue as one of the most authentic Szechuan style Chinese restaurants in Vegas from what I remember. David Chang has also talked about their great Xiaolongbao, so I decided to pay little attention to Yelp's bad reviews since I know most Yelpers judge unfairly/ignorantly, judge how \"good or bad\" a restaurant is based on just a couple of dishes out of a wide menu, judge complaining of price, regardless on how good the food was, or judge almost only based on service when food in my opinion should be the main focus of any yelp review, since True foodies should go to any lenghts to get a good bite, even with poor customer service sometimes...  The hostesses were very rude and almost seemed racist towards non asian customers. They seemed to seat asian parties in no time and everyone else got quoted times of over an hr wait even when the restaurant seemed quite empty.   With that being said, everything was pretty amazing with the exception of the tapioca mango dessert which I couldn't finish since it had a funky almost fermented unexpected taste to it.  The restaurant's ambiance and decor are extremely unique and memorable.",

    "text": "I took my family here years ago and remembered it being pretty good. Since we were staying close by, we had to give this place another try.  Got here on a slow Monday night but still had to wait 30 minutes to get seated (for whatever reason). The hostess looked like she didn't have a clue on managing a wait list (with only two parties on the list).  When we finally got seated, it took another 10 minutes for our server to show up. We settled on some basic fried rice, chow mein, and one of my faves: Beef Shank Noodle Soup.   The fried rice was bland. Bland to the point where we had to look for soy sauce to drench it in. The chow mein was too salty and \"saucey\". There was a lot of sauce on the bottom and certainly what we aren't used to when having chow mein. If they could've somehow combine the level of saltiness from the noodles into the blandness of the fried rice, we would've had a winner.   The Beef Shank Noodle Soup was decent, however. The broth could've been more flavorful (maybe add more star anise?); it also needed more kick (stronger peppers?). But they weren't stingy with the shanks and it was tender.   We did notice one of the executive chefs blowing his nose in the kitchen and not washing his hands afterwards. Not good.  The service and food doesn't justify the price point. Three dishes, one appetizer, and two ($5) sodas with tip, it added up to $100. Rather than dining here at a restaurant masquerading as an \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant, we should've just made the short drive into Las Vegas Chinatown instead.",

One of me and I wanted to sit at the bar - that should not take long but the hostess was a bit slow.  Once the food was ordered though, the food came fairly quickly. 2. I ordered Chicken & mushroom noodles (AWESOME), Shanghai dumplings (not good), and cucumber salad (just okay).  I would go back just for the chicken & mushroom noodles because it was really delicious but don't set high expectations for the speed of service.",

    "text": "First and foremost ,you have to understand that you're eating Chinese food at a casino. If you can grasp that then your dining experience expectations will be dramatically different(meaning you have to  lower your standards; it's equivalent to a weekend of heavy drinking if you were single and you're looking to settle for the night minus the walk of shame in the morning). We dined here solely because my friend (the groom) really wanted his fix of noodles and wonton.   For those that are accustomed to a lower price point for similar food back home, they will most likely get a nice wake up call since the price point for the menu here is significantly higher (again you have to grasp the realization that you're dining at a casino). We ordered  the wonton, egg noodle soup; beef stew noodles; and the xiao long baos (soup dumplings). The wontons were suprisingly flavorful, the xiao long baos were decent although the texture of the dumpling skin was on the soggy side, and the beef stew would probably be the best dish we had. But for obvious reasons it's not food that I would wait on line for or anything.  As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food wasn't the best, but when you're fiending for some Chinese food and you're in the middle of the desert, expect to pay a higher price point to somewhat get that fix. However, a full satisfaction of what you're yearning for may not be fully met. Nonetheless, it may just help hold you over till you head back to you respective go to Chinese place back home. It could be worse, what if there was only a P.F. Chang's or only  mall type of a take out that was around? Bottomline, the place is serviceable to somewhat meet your fiending needs of rice or noodles.",

Umm, is it just me that think that is cruel?  Mr. Chang our server and waiter was great. He was welcoming and attentive. He was not too pushy and definitely had a sense of humor. The food is alright. Not the best, but not the worst. Come here on an empty stomach or drunk and the food will be delicious. I can't remember all the dishes we ordered, but I left satisfied nonetheless.  The chow mien noodle dishes and fried rice are decent, not bland and not oily like other Chinese restaurants in Vegas. The Ma Po Tofu and Kung Pao Chicken dish are good with just the right amount of spices. The Sauteed Seasoned Vegetable are also good, not oily at all. The Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs are ok, not dry and easy to chew.   For a party of 12 we ate family style and each paid $20. We didn't order a lot, so expect to pay more to be full if your eating family style.",

    "text": "It was Saturday at 11:15. We had just been turned away from one of our favorite Vegas restaurants because the kitchen had just had a fire and they were closing the restaurant.  Disappointed, we checked Yelp and found Beijing 9.   B9 is in Caesar's Palace.  So, I made a quick stop to get my Caesar's club card so I could get a discount. (Club members get a dollar or so off each entree).  We ordered the Marinated beef shank as a starter. Very interesting. It wasn't a jerky but it wasn't really moist either. You could taste the five spice and other interesting flavors. A nice start.   Next, the Szechwan Fish. Delicious fresh perfectly cooked flaky fish in a wonderful spicy red broth. This dish was spicy hot. Wow. Great spice that just kept on going. With one complaint, I had to ask for rice as that is extra, I was in heaven.  Next, egg noodles with the eggplant and garlic sauce. The eggplant had such fantastic depth and flavor. The noodles fresh, cooked appropriately and providing fantastic flavor.   At about $70 for two of us for lunch, it was expensive. But when the pub with the famous chef's name on it next door is serving $20 burgers, this place was certainly appropriate, if not less expensive, than it's neighbors.  (That said, I will pass on ordering two $3.50 ice teas and stick with water next time.)  Overall, fresh, cooked as it should be and very good flavors. Yes. I am a fan and hope to be back. Thank you!",

Beef with vegetables - This was the better of the two. Beef was tender and I got to eat veggies, but the sauce was quite bland too.   White Rice - FOUR DOLLARS!!??!?!? Are you kidding me??

    "text": "They serve SHARK FIN SOUP! They call it the \"Seafood Special Soup\" which is code for Shark fin soup and the $100+ price tag confirms what it is. Google shark fin soup to learn how horrible a practice this is.   Furthermore, even if you don't care that you are supporting a business that practices the endearing of animal species, then you should care that the food sucks.   I came here with a group and only after ordering and eating did I notice the \"soup special.\" So my 1star review of the food part was for before I knew of their soup. If I could give a negative rating--- I would.   The food was tasteless and I ordered their famous noodles, which there is only a small selection of actual noodle plates, ironic for a restaurant with \"noodle\" in the name.   I tried many dishes from the large group order and wasn't impressed with any of them. When the bill came, the experience left an even worse taste in our mouths as we realized that they charged $4 for each dinky bowl of rice that was brought to the table...rice that we didn't ask for.   The prices were crazy EXPENSIVE even for Las Vegas! I mean at least in Vegas if you buy food and it costs a lot you get a huge serving---not here! Servings were small to medium at most.  Oh and the service was horrible. One entree didn't show up until 15+ minutes after the rest of them. Three of us also had to leave for a show as we waited for the bill to arrive. About 15 minutes later 2 more people had to leave--- leaving 2 people to wait at the table for the bill or the waiter to come by. By the time the waiter got to the table, our group of 7 people was down to only 2 people and he hadn't noticed the mass exodus that had left the table! So, maybe 30 minutes later the bill arrived.   The only good things were the dumplings and the lychee martini, but nothing special as I have had similar quality many times over.   My advice...Take a pretty photo of the restaurant and their goldfish aquarium and move on..Go somewhere else, anywhere!   Advice to restaurant; Don't be such a dick and kill of sharks and screw over your patrons with crappy food and high prices.",

The egg and tomato is something I make myself..  albeit with rice, but still, it ain't no thang, and they charge like 12 or 13 bucks for it.  The decor was a little off putting, I think.  I mean, it was \"neat\"..  but, just too busy..  or something.  Like snazzy contemporary, but no soul.  I dunno, I can't put my finger on it.  Service was aight.  Took forever to get our bill.  Overall, it's one of those places that are eh, not bad..  but nothing to get that enthused about.",

    "text": "A hand pulled Chinese noodle shop in a Las Vegas hotel?  Gotta be a fake, right?  Wrong - this is actually pretty authentic stuff.  We tried a few of their noodle dishes - all thick round wheat noodles.  In the beef broth, as well as panfried, and with the eggplant sauce.  I have to say the dishes are solid.  Good selection and good price range, although the noodle dishes are VERY LIGHT on the protein quotient.  So if you order the beef broth noodles, do not expect anything more than 1 serving of beef.  Well, the noodles should fill you up though.  Wait staff is ok, but the hostess is SNOTTY.  One of those pretty skinny dolled up Asian girls with enormous attitude.  Your basic nightmare.  Go for the food (if you're stuck on the strip), oogle the goldfish, and ignore the hostess.  That's my recommendation.",

It has an all white interior with orange accents including large fish tanks full of orange gold fish. the white tables have orange accents with the beautiful blown glass glasses. I wish I could have taken one home! Now onto the food. We started with an order of spring rolls. I was starving and they were good. I really liked the spicy mustard sauce that was served with them.  I got a noodle dish - homemade noodles with eggplant - for lunch, how could I not when their specialty is home made noodles?! I was not disappointed - the noodles were delicious and the serving size was perfect.   All and all I was pleased with my lunch experience. The service was great too.",

Decor is interesting but very bright, and if you stare at them long enough, you'll get dizzy.  Food is okay, but extremely overpriced.  Food presentation is very unappetizing.  Ordered soup and it looked like dishwater with mushrooms floating on it.  For the price they charge, we at least expected a good portion of food, but expected too much again.  Service was undesirable.  Server obviously trying to avoid eye contact when she notice we need something.  She also acts as if we should be thankful that she's there to serve us.

The cuisine is just as stellar. :) Very fresh & authentic tasting. You are able to see the chefs hard at work from your table. I tried the salt & pepper shrimp, (many huge, juicy shrimps that were very tasty!) some kind of fried fish in a black bean sauce, (which was very flavorful and had been accompanied by yummy fried veggies) also tried the hand-pulled noodles in an eggplant sauce. (Sauce was savoury with eggplant chunks; no need for any meat in this dish) Very fair prices; show your Total Rewards card for a bit of savings! The wait for a table wasn't bad, only waited a few minutes but if you are worried that the restaurant might be very busy and you absolutely hate waiting, there's a reservation hotline number listed on the Beijing Noodle No. 9 Yelp page! Good stuff, check it out!",

The sauce tasted a little weird and did not complement the noodle,             My other daughter ordered \"Shrimp Chow Mein\" prized at $22.99 while my son ordered \"Wok-Fried Chow Mein with Chicken\".  There were not much noodles and it tasted unbelievably scant and unmemorable,  Nothing special. We come from an Asian background and we know our palate.

However,  the most disturbing part was watching a server clear a table to our left.  3 minutes later she must have realized that they weren't finished and she went BACK IN THE TRASH (bus bin) to take out the food and put it back on the table.  As she was doing it another server came by and chatted,  knowing what was happening,  and gave direction about what to do.  I was dumbfounded.

The soup dumplings were pretty good but the sauce was just pure soy sauce not the special soup dumpling sauce (sad) . What I didn't like is instead of giving spoons they had it in the little tins ... so everytime we took a bite the soup would just spill on our plates. The wait was half an hour which we didn't mind since we weren't too hungry .about 20 mins later , finally being seated . I noticed half the restaurant was empty ...but that's on them . Overall the soup dumpling was good . The sauteed eggplant , walnut prawns, twice cooked pork and a noodle dish (don't remember the name) . The place is pretty pricy though",

The food is good. The General Tao chicken is very tasty - I'd recommended that. I guess they add something to the sauce that makes it very tasty.

You have to try their coconut shrimps & walnut dish! Better than Panda Express. Anyways, just find out for yourself then....",

    "text": "This place has one of the most beautiful interiors - huge tanks of goldfish in the front, and a sleek white and red decor inside.  Like Noodles in Bellagio, expect to pay 2x to 3x the usual price in say Chinatown for noodle dishes.  Note they have a dual price structure - Caesars reward members get a buck off each dish or so.  I got the Dan Dan noodles with spring noodles and an order of six pan-seared pot stickers.  I got the wife the Shanghai-style wonton with shrimp and egg noodles.  Dan Dan noodles looked a bit light on sauce but it turned out to be a good ratio since it had some serious kick.  Very good noodles - round, smooth, and slightly chewy.  Pot Stickers were excellent - worth the 15 mins prep time since they were golf-ball sized with a single edge that was perfectly seared. The skin around the seared edge was soft, but it held the juicy pork-cabbage filling perfectly.  The dark sauce also had a nice spicy kick.  I  only took a nibble from my wife's dish and it was OK.  Definitely lighter mellow broth characteristic of Cantonese style.  The prawns and wontons in her bowl were huge!  I like this place slightly better than Bellagio's Noodles. They do seem to know how to add kick to their Northern-style noodles and dumplings.",

The hot and sour soup was typical nothing special. Atmosphere is clean and is incredible. If only they changed their menu to accommodate that would be the smartest move they could make.  The Duck noodle dish looked great.  I hope to return in an effort to improve this rating.   Currently I feel it's overpriced and under delivered.  The staff are amazing....

    "text": "You know, this place got a bit of a bad rap from what I can see on these other reviews for it. I am by no means an expert on this type of cuisine, but I do know what tastes good to me - this place was pretty good!  I was here for a conference, and like many of you all, I hate to have a 'table for one' situation, but so be it. I figured this would be the quickest, easiest meal for the first night before all my amigos arrive. I am also a big fan of soup dumplings, and so I just had to try them out here.  I ordered the vegetable spring rolls, the soup dumplings and the beef chow fun. I hadn't eaten too much during the day, and so I was hungry. I was glad to see that they bring out reasonable portions - not the overflowing piles of bland gunk you can get at resort restaurants. The orders weren't meager, but they weren't wasteful, either.  The spring rolls came out hot and tasty - they had a nice duck sauce that was really complimentary, and did not overwhelm with sweetness. One of the other reviewers thought they were \"mushy,\" but I can honestly say that the consistency inside that nice, crispy outside was what I expected bok choy and other vegetables to be like after taking a hot bath in the fryer.  The soup dumplings were super tasty - the only thing that was a bit hard was that they come in small aluminum bowls, and mine were a little stuck to the bottom - unfortunately, this led to me tearing the skins more than once, and the soup leaked out onto my plate. I would have preferred having them just come out on the paper and having a big soup spoon to hold them with and do the nibble / sip thing I was taught at another place, but hey, they were tasty. I'm sure I caught my waiter snickering a little bit at my clumsiness, though. I would have done it as well - I looked crazy.  The beef chow fun was definitely not bland (someone here thought it was...) and I thought the beef and scallions went really nicely with the wide rice noodles and rich soy. It wasn't overly salty or under seasoned. The dish was slightly more oily than I would have liked, but I know how rice noodles can really stick to the wok when you are trying to cook at higher heat for searing the meat. It wasn't excessive, just more than I like to do at home.  Service was great - my waiter was super-attentive, bringing me nice, cold Tsingtao to keep me well hydrated throughout my meal, and I would consider coming back later in the week for lunch. Worth a try - probably good to get reservations in the evening - it was really busy.",

There's $30 fried rice on the menu!  I opted for chicken stir fry with asparagus and mushrooms because it was one of the few items with vegetables.

Our waitress didn't acknowledge us for the longest time, I was just waiting at random people until someone came over to take our order. The appetizers were very expensive but so disappointing we finished neither. Mushroom caps and pork dumplings. The clincher was the entrees. My boyfriend convinced me to splurge because we're on holiday, so I ordered a 38 dollar sea bass. The picture says a thousand words. I was infuriated. The whole meal should've cost total of 30 dollars but it was 104 before tip. NEVER AGAIN.",

Monday around lunch  time and it was still a wait even though there was plenty of open tables.   Ordered a couple of dishes, chicken with mixed veggies, bbq pork bun, shrimp fried rice, beef spare ribs and a 2 and half pound lobster stir fry. It looked really good as the table never to us ordered it as well. Honestly, I would have skipped out on it. There was no flavor, it was bland and. We did have it with noodles underneath which was ok but a tad salty. The ribs was very greasy. Out of the dishes we ordered, the chicken and veggies was the only dishes that was worth the money.   We could have just went to chinatown for half the price. 200 before tip and that's just with hot tea and no drinks.  Don't think I'll be giving this place a second visit.",

Found out the server ordered it wrong for us and had it made with ginger. When he took it back, he came back to tell us the cooks will take about an hour to reheat the oil and recook the new crab with salt n pepper. Pretty much he is trying to say we have to eat it. I don't even like crab with ginger on it.  So my husband cracks open the leg of the crab, it is not even fresh crab! It's old and has been dead and smelled fishy! The server didn't even take it off our bill when we complained how old this crab was. (We eat seafood a lot to know what a live freshly killed crab or lobster is supposed to taste like.) ugh! Besides that, this Chinese restaurant was one of my favorites and has really good tasting Thai iced tea, beef chow fun, walnut shrimp and salt n pepper shrimp is amazing! They make fresh hand made noodles in the mornings. Soooo delicious!   Just be very cautious when ordering fresh crab or lobster. They are faaaaar from fresh!    The ambiance of this restaurant is beautiful esp with all the fish tanks and cute gold fish swimming around! Very lovely! Just go in for items that are the handmade noodles or something like the won ton noodle soup. Can't go wrong.",

The decor is bright; I liked the ceilings and the modern feel but ultimately, it's just a slightly fancier cafe setup. They have an extensive menu which makes it a good spot if you're there with a group.  My favorite dish was the Mini-Wonton in Numbing Chili Oil. My nose was sweating eating them but I couldn't get enough. I also enjoyed the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns, but was hoping for a little more meat, and the Crispy Chicken with Salt & Pepper was flavorful but too dry for me.   The service was prompt and we enjoyed our meal. It's not a trendy spot but rather a solid choice for dinner before catching a show. There are so many places to choose from in Vegas I'm not sure I'd return here but if you are at Caesars and want Chinese food, then I'd make a stop in here.",

But the wait time at this noodle place isnt too much better--we waited for half an hour outside and another half an hour for our order, while the restaurant was half full the whole time. There were waiters and waitresses just idling around. And they didnt let us order when we were waiting outside even though the restaurant does take-out. So inflexible.  In terms of the food, the beef noodle and the dandan noodle were average, kung pao chicken was horrible. The prices almost double the usual prices at normal Chinese restaurants. We later found that Bally's had a Chinese noodle restaurant as well, much better prices.  While we were eating, the restaurant was only half full too but still made people wait outside. Just because you have a good location does not mean you can treat customers like this. If people werent starving, why would they come to an obviously overpriced Chinese restaurant in Vegas? Btw, what kind of expensive Chinese restaurant does not offer tea?",

The dishes are a little bit expensive, even though you expect it to be a little high-priced since you're in the middle of the Strip in Las Vegas. For the amount of food we got, I'd expected the prices to be a little lower. For one, you may get one noodle dish and an appetiser to be fulfilled. For two, maybe one more noodle dish.  It was a little hard to find since Caesar's Palace is so big!  I did like that you can choose whichever kind of noodles they have for any kind of stir fry or soup style. That was a nice touch of customisation. The hand-stretched noodles were the best!! The knife-shredded noodles are a close second.  Ordered: -Soft Tofu and Chives -Tofu Strip Salad in Sesame Oil -Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumpling Pork -Shredded Duck Meat, Rice Vermicelli Soup -Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Soup with knife-shredded noodles -Tomato and Egg Sauce with hand-stretched noodles  All were quite delicious except the Beijing Pork Wonton soup. It didn't have the traditional Chinese chicken soup flavor.",

The shrimp in the noodles and the S&P were very large maybe U15 or so, and cooked properly. The S&P crumbs were delicious as usual. The noodles were fresh, but nothing that special. There are better noodle places around. Sea bass was too sweet, almost tasted like a dessert. The black pepper sauce is tasty on the mushrooms and the pork was tender with a light and refreshing flavor between the chinese parsley and the garlic. Overall the food was good, but overpriced. We ate all the food and we were content and happy, however, Chinese food this expensive needs to knock me out of my seat, but it didn't.   Also, rice is 2.09 a bowl, didn't buy any, but that is definitely minus points in my book.",

    "text": "First of all, I'm Chinese, and I'm carbophobic. No, I don't really like rice or noodle, so why do I come here when I come to Vegas? I love the Lan Zhou hand pulled noodle, specifically the broth, beef, and veggie in the noodle soup. I love the fact that they always accomodate my request for less noodle but more veggie with extra cilantro and green onions. The broth is so yummy, light yet flavorful.   I also like their black pepper filet migon cubes (very tender!), yangzhou style fried rice with shrimp and beef (suprisingly not greasy at all), and dim sum dishes.    I've come here with non-Asian friends (white, Indian, and Jewish), and none of them has ever complained about the quality or service or flavor of the food here.   I agree it is quite pricey, but again you are in Vegas! Also I'm sure those stunning-looking fish cost a fortune.",

We waited over two hours to get in hoping the food is going to be good since this place was beautifully decorated. I was SOOOOOO wrong. After we got in, we ordered hand-pulled noodles soup thinking that it was this restaurants specialty, the soup noodles (3 beef brisket/ $16 for each + chicken soup noodles) came out cold and we had to finish it bc we were extremely hungry n we were no longer have the energy to wait after the whole day traveling from California to Vegas. The bill came out $75 and it was a waste of time, money and energy. I highly not recommended this place.",

    "text": "The service here is absolutely awful. Our party of five was told a 30 minute wait and at the 30 minute mark we could literally see them clean and reset our table from where we were standing. But it took an additional 15 minutes for them to seat us, simply because no one bothered to come get us where we stood watching the chef hand pull noodles in the front of the restaurant. There was no hostess at the front podium monitoring the situation.   Finally seated, it took 10-15 minutes for them to fill our water glasses and take our order. They were busy-ish, so I understood to some extent. When our orders were taken, it took them about 35 minutes to check in on us again, and only then because the chef was dropping off three of our dishes from the noodle kitchen. We waited about 15 more minutes for our waitress to come back to our table with my friend's spicy chicken dish. We requested that she check on the last few dishes we were waiting on.... A curry and the dim sum that we ordered as APPETIZERS. She disappeared for 10 minutes and only came back to our table because I called out for her attention from where she loitered by the cash register. As someone who prides herself on her manners and tact, I found it extremely embarrassing that I had to go to this length to get her attention.  At this point we asked for the manager and explained why. Our waters had been empty for almost an hour. Four of us had been served entrees while the fifth waited and waited. Our appetizers never showed up. And we were never offered an apology or an explanation. The manager came over and made a laundry list of excuses. He explained that they have two kitchens... That it's hard to coordinate the dishes to come out simultaneously... That the dumplings needed time to steam... That the curry is made from scratch... All of this until I politely told him that I am an amateur home chef but I can produce a chicken curry from scratch in 30 minutes. His professional chefs should be able to do it in that time or less.   He disappeared and then returned 5 minutes later with my friend's curry. Soon thereafter our waitress brought out the dim sum we'd ordered over an hour ago as appetizers. The manager kindly comped the food that was so late... Which was nice, but an apology from the get go would have been FAR more appreciated than the song and dance of excuses and blame he served us to begin with. He finally apologized when I pointed this out. We never got an apology from our server.   The entire service experience was a complete and total failure.   On the plus side, the hand pulled noodles with chicken and mushrooms were excellent, as were the BBQ buns and the spicy chicken dish (not sure of the name).   The dumplings and the curry were bland and unseasoned.   My one star is totally and completely for the quality of the authentic noodle dishes. Nothing else. We will not return and we will advise others not to waste their time or patience here. There are far better run authentic Chinese establishments on and around the strip.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed our dinner here!  We intended to go to the buffet at Ceasar's but my buffet paranoia (not being able to stop eating) kicked in and we stopped at this noodle shop. We were seated immediately--next to Jesse James and new wife, and no, I didn't say \"HOW could you cheat on the beautiful and talented Sandra Bullock?!?!?\"--and the server was really great. He was patient as we asked about every type of tea, gave us time, checked in, and seemed genuinely interested in our having a good meal.   We ordered the seasonal veggies for an appetizer--holy Jesus, I could eat those every day. Perfectly cooked (ie, crisp and tender) asparagus, Chinese broccoli, and baby bok choy in a DELISH sauce. Heavenly.   My lychee martini was strong, yum, with two lychee so hubs could have one-- find that in any other city!   Entree time--we asked what the dish is that people come back for and the server said the chow mein. Ok, serve it up! I was a little disappointed that it meant not picking my noodle, but I survived. I ordered the beef, hubs the combo. When they brought hubs the chicken and we said, \"No, the combo,\" there were no faces or general poopiness, they just got him a new dinner (which took an appropriate amount of time, so some thought went into it for sure. You want it to take a bit when you send something back!).  My beef was good, maybe a little chewy, but I'm not much of a beef eater so I don't know. Hubs said his was delish. The noodles were super yummy--no complaints there.  The sauce was great. Our waters were always refilled. The server was really attentive, but not over the top. And I thought it was Vanilla Ice sitting at the table next to us. I wonder how Jesse James would feel about that.   Here's the part that makes me say I really, really like the service and food here. We asked for those dessert rice balls because I've never tried them. They didn't have any. The server offered ice cream balls. I didn't want that, so we said we were all set. The server then came over with 4 cookies on a plate and apologized for not having the dessert we wanted and made the cutest joke: Yes, I made those cookies for you just now!    I'm a baker, so I know me some cookies. Those were some of the best (ok, wait, the friggin' best) almond cookies I have EVER had, complete with a honey glaze and a few whole almonds on top, with the tiniest, I mean tiniest, hint of salt. Perfecto.   So, I'll be back. Not sure why the negative reviews; I think this is a hidden gem for every day food.   PS--the interior is amazing!",

Even though I looked at Yelp and saw a 2 1/2 star rating, I had been here several years ago and it was pretty good. We were craving Chinese, so we thought we'd go..,....no line on a Saturday night........that should have been a sign.  There are many complaints about the price......yea it's expensive, but hey, most restaurants on the strip are.  The issue is the food and service. We ordered pork buns for appetizer and there were small and uninspired, but not too bad. Then we waited and waited and waited. When we came in, there were only 6-8 tables filled. We watched as others, who came in long after us, being served their meals. Several complaints to our server were met with \"I'll check\". Still waiting and we asked for the manager. Young female manager came over and apologized and said it was busy and since we didn't order noodles, our meals were cooked in another kitchen. Come on? Then the table next to us, who sat down 30 minutes after us and ordered virtually the same thing, got their meals. Called the manager back. She said she'd look into it. Came back and said our server screwed up. She never bothered trying to figure it out the first time. Mistakes happen! But the our food arrived. Crispy Chicken in garlic sauce and fried rice. I've had almost as good at Panda Express. Not impressed. Won't be back.",

The seats located at the counter overlooking the boiling waters ready in anticipation for those fresh hand stretched noodles are great for a quick dine-in with free entertainment. The restaurant pulls fresh noodles during brunch/lunch hours so there won't be too much of a show at night.   The food varies. If you're looking for authenticity, you may want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for good ol' American Chinese food, you've hit the jackpot. As someone who grew up in Beijing with Beijing comfort food as our nightly menu; take it from me, the food produced here is far from China quality. However, they (the restaurant) has well executed the concept of Beijing-style food and caters to satisfying American taste buds.   Case and point? We ate at Beijin Noodle four consecutive days for lunch and dinner. At each meal, American's mostly ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Shrimp. Chinese don't really eat those dishes. Maybe American Chinese, but not Chinese from China.   You're probably asking why we even ate there so many time in a row if the food was only \"meh.\" Well, they had one particular dish that reminded me of grammy's cooking - sliced potatoes.  Each day I asked them to add ja tsai to the dish the way my grams did, and each time I ate the dish it nearly brought me to tears reminiscing of my 4' 3\" nai nai.   So because of that one Beijing-style dish, I went nearly the entire time I stayed in Vegas.",

    "text": "Yes, super over priced! Like most people, the buffet line was too long so had to eat here. The place is nice, but the food and service sucks.  The hostess skirt is so short that just standing I can almost see something I don't need to see.  The noodles were oily, the XLB were disgusting, most items lacked flavor. The one decent thing was the beef pancake.  Also our waitress tried to be nice, but she was up in our face. She would come to our table and stand there for a few seconds, stare at us then say something. I really wanted green onion pancake. It took forever to come. I asked twice where is my green onion pancake. The people there kept saying it's coming. Finally everyone was done eating and still no green onion pancake. I complained and the stupid lady goes \"oh you ordered that?\" I was so mad, she can see the red in my eyes and then she switced to nice mode saying how sorry she is and she will put in the order now. I said no, I want the check so I can leave. She kept saying it will be ready. I'm like NO!   Bad service! A little too late to fix anything.",

I would give that experience a 4 star. The second time we went, it was on a Sunday night at 9 pm and there was a 30 minute wait. The service was terrible and the food was not the best. I don't recommend anyone order the coconut curry or the chicken chow mein. Save a trip to a Thai restaurant for coconut curry and walk down and across the street to PF Changs( not kidding you- and I hate chains!) for the chow mein.  Not only will it save you lots of money but it will taste better and you'll get better service.",

I would suggest the tomato and egg noddle, the Lan Zhou noddle, and the Dan Dan noodle. If you come here, order something special. But the problem is that everything here is special.

Unfortunately it goes along with other reviews referring to them asking if you want rice and then charging $7 for a small bowl of plain, white rice.

If I knew I'd be waiting almost an hour to get seated I would have made reservations. But other than that, the food was good. Nothing really spectacular about the flavors. We ordered the spicy chicken cubes, honey BBQ pork bejing pancake wrap with cilantro and chicken and mushroom with hand pull noodle. Everything we tried had standard Chinese sauces except for the pancake wrap. The honey BBQ pork bejing pancake wrap was my favorite of the bunch. It had nice a nice mix of flavors with the sweetness of the BBQ pork with the herby freshness from the cilantro.",

I got the beef brisket noodle bowl.  The pieces of beef were so big I had to take them out of the bowl and cut them with a knife and fork.  At first, that may seem like a good thing, but I also had to cut them in to small enough bites that I could chew on it for about 30 seconds to render the chewy fat stuck to every piece.  The noodles were really good... and maybe I'm just not cultured enough to know how to eat them, lol.  I was using chopsticks but the noodles were so long, I had to bite them and let them fall back into the bowl which resulted in a nice splash that spotted my dress shirt.  If the noodle was short enough to slurp into my mouth, it whipped a nice stream of broth across my face to wipe off.  Needless to say, it didn't even cost me any money personally because it was on my company's dime and it still gets 2 stars.",

I even spoke with two people because the host got distracted.  On another occasion, they forgot to include the utensils, chopsticks, and soy sauce.  My friend had to go downstairs again to pick them up.  Unfortunately, the service dining in wasn't any better.  From the start, the restaurant was more than half empty, but there were a lot of people waiting to be seated.  We all didn't see a reason for it because the tables were cleared and cleaned.  After eating here several times, I expected an improvement after every visit - especially since they're located at Caesars Palace.  I really wanted to give this place a chance, but never again for me.  The decor is quite nice, though.  Now that the food court is open after the renovations, there are more options for a quick bite to eat.",

The reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars is because of the food and service.   Service was mediocre and not friendly. The waiter was actually kind of rude. When my bf asked him a question about a food ingredient, he gave him a wise ass answer with some attitude, zero smile and was abrupt. (Minus 1 star)  LOUD. Must everyone yell in here?! My bf and I werent, the 2 couples sitting next to us werent, but why did it sound like everyone else in the restaurant was yelling? The yelling was actually the first thing we noticed when we arrived.   So bizarre. (Minus 1 star)  The food..  small portions for ridiculous prices. We had the:  Beijing Style Zha Jiang Mein: 18.09 (DO NOT ORDER THIS. I love Zha Jiang Mein, and was so excited to try theirs....but this was absolutely the worst I've ever had. It was like eating dark brown/black salt paste. Small bowl with a few tiny pieces of pork. I will eat  just about anything when it comes to food, but this was actually inedible.  We just ended up leaving it on the table after tasting it. ) (Minus 1 star.)  Beef Chow Fun 16.09 (This was ok. Tiny tiny portion of meat, like 3 small slices of beef on top a little bed of chow fun. Nothing special)  Pork and Chives Dumplings (6 pices) 11.09 (This was decent, but about as good as the ones I buy from Trader Joes and microwave for 3-4 minutes. It comes with a sauce that tastes like soy sauce, vinegar and ginger. Nothing special)  Sauteed Seasonal Vegetables (Chinese Broccoli) 15.09 (This was probably the only thing I liked, but where where all the tops of the broccoli? They gave us mostly stems! There were about 3 small broccoli tops and a handful of stems.)  Total $60.63 + 4.17 tax and 9.00 tip= $75.17   For those of you who think people here are just complaining about the prices, I think you are missing the point. FOR WHAT YOU GET... the prices are ridiculous. (Minus 1 star)  Just because a restaurant charges a lot of money doesnt make it a great restaurant. Great restaurants have great food that you would want to eat again regardless of price.   One good thing about this restaurant is that it is extremely clean. The fish tank, chairs, tables and floors are spotless. +1 star.  My friend (non-asian, but a foodie) said that he orders the pepper shrimp and the lobster. He says they are excellent. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items.. Until next time I guess... But for now I can only give this place 2 stars..  (btw... I am Asian and I DO know what good Chinese food is... and SF and SGV have restaurants that have wayyyyyy better authentic Chinese food than this place.)",

Foodwise, my friend and I split the YangZou Fried Rice which was good, but I noticed they used the spam-like pork in the rice, which I'm not a fan of..  We also shared the Shrimp and Chive dumplings which were ok - something was missing in the flavor of these, and they were a bit drier than I would've liked. Overall, not bad food for the price, but not something to get excited about.",

The actual soup is bland and the meat quantities are low for the price of noodles. Around 17 dollars for a large bowl of noodles and 4 pieces of meat. But what makes this restaurant 3 stars instead of 1 is the customer service, decoration, and the taste of the meat here. The customer service is completely friendly and are professional. The ambience is quite casual here and the decoration is amazing. They have glass tanks of fish and make it feel more authentic. The noodles may be bland but everything else on the menu is pretty alright. But overall, it's a okay place.",

I did think it was a bit overpriced, but that seems to be the norm for Vegas. The decor is beautiful and it's really fun to eat in such a unique environment.   My only complaint would be that the service was not at all impressive. We had to wait to be seated when there were only 2 other customers and none of our servers (yes, there were multiple), nor the hostess went out of their way to be friendly.   But the food was yummy and I'd visit again.",

It took a while for us to realize that she wasn't yelling at us, she just talked that way to everyone so kind of made us feel better. I ordered the Fried Rice. I wanted tofu in place of chicken and the waitress initially said no but when I asked her why she couldn't do it, she caved. My friends ordered a lot of dumplings which they loved.

    "text": "Every friend of mine (and granted, most of them are FOB Chinese) that has visited Beijing Noodle Company has complained about the place, citing that the food was terrible, the service was terrible, etc.  However, I decided to visit anyways...needing a quick place to grab something to eat for my little toddler. Expecting the worst, I came out of the experience pleasantly surprised.   The decor will get you the first time you walk in...it feels like you are eating inside a giant egg, with millions of goldfish surrounding you (yes, I know eggs and fish don;t necessarily go together - but someone should have told the designers of this place).   The food though, was not terrible. Sure, it was not super authentic, but it wasn't tasteless or horrible. It reminded me...well, it reminded me of something I can find at any Chinese Cafe in Houston. I ordered both a stir fried noddle dish and a veggie dish, and both were good enough to continue eating.  The prices are steep...as all Vegas prices on the Strip are, so let's just stop complaining about that. Having said that, the service was the only thing I was disappointed about, but not so much that I have to complain on Yelp. They were slow, but not so much that I was wondering where my food or water was at all times. It just seemed odd that it took as much time as it did with a half empty restaurant to bring two dishes out...but that is all I will really say about the service. We all have our off days and times during the day when production is not what it should be...I get it!  Either way, this is not a bad place to spend some time, especially if you need a quick bite and you happen to find yourself reliving the Hangover Part I. Not to mention, noodles are good eats especially if you find yourself pulling out your own incisor just to win a bet or prove a point!",

All this craziness. I literally had doughy wrapper in soup for lunch. I mean their soup is light and flavorful but it tasted like misc. powder made soup. It was also extremely salty.  The Lai Mien (hand pulled noodles) wasn't bad, but after awhile it tastes redundant. It's a little bit on the chewy side for me too. There was a tiny piece of beef that came with my soup noodle, it was saddening.  I absolutely had nothing for the spicy cold noodles.  Their portions might look tiny but it's actually a pretty hefty serving. So do keep that in mind when you see the price.  But for $20/dish (on average), I would rather have a Subway sandwich, 4 times.",

    "text": "Decor: Amazing decor. Modern and great lighting.  How it relates to Chinese food? Not sure. But I like how it doesn't go for \"Orientalism\" design that establishments can easily fall into. That's why I gave it a second star.  Food: If it wasn't for the Interior Decoration, this place would have gotten a 1-Star.  We ordered Jelly Fish, Yang Chow Fried Rice, Salt & Peppered Shrimp, Chow Mein Noodles, and Hot Tea.  1) Portions were small. I'm not sure if it's because they consider themselves a Gourmet Restaurant, if that's the case, then I should deduct points for presentation.   Presentation? There is none... it's just served on a plate like a regular Chinese Restaurant.  2) Taste. None to Bland. Out of all the dishes we ordered, I only enjoyed the Salt & Peppered Shrimp. It was crispy, not too greasy, not really spicy.  3) Service was bad. Servers are as attentive and personable as a regular Chinese Restaurant. Which I don't mind, when I'm eating at family owned Chinese Restaurants. But I expect better service when I'm ordering plates that are $16 - $20 at the lowest.  - The Host was a young woman who didn't smile or didn't make us welcome... That's your job as a host!!!   4) Price. Crazy! I don't understand how they justify charging people for this place. The Thai Iced Tea is $6.99..... Yup, you read that right.   I would seriously question the pallet of any person that gave this place more than 3 stars. My advice, just go to Chinatown and find yourself a family owned restaurant.",

There were plenty of tables for 1-2 people available at this time.    I stood there by the entrance, no msg on my phone and the same hostess didn't bother to acknowledge my existence.  I waited for 5-10min when I finally asked when my table would be ready. Same hostess that took my number earlier asked me for my number again even though she had already taken my number AND tables were available.  I told her that she had already taken my  number over 30min ago.  She just gave me a blank look then grabbed a menu and took me to one of the many available seats.  Lucky that the food is decent otherwise I'd rate this a one star and never return.  The waiter that I had was friendly and the rest of my meal was uneventful.  If I was the manager, I'd get rid of that hostess.  But maybe in Vegas they get enough one time customers that they don't worry about customer service or satisfaction.",

But the zha jian noodle was far worse: the noodles were so mushy there were actually hunks of smashed together starchy mush that bore no resemblance to having previously been noodles, and the tiny tidbits of meat they used were so fermented they actually tasted spoiled. We barely finished to chow mein, and chose to leave the other one unfinished. I don't always let bad reviews of places stop me, but definitely steer clear of this place.",

We ate well, flavors better than we expected but the price was outrageous. The onion pancakes were only a few slices and not even a full circle! Would've been the same dining at the buffet if we didn't have to wait. Maybe next time.",

    "text": "I thought Beijing Noodle was pretty good. If there wasn't so much to try in Vegas, I probably would have gone back a couple more times.   I don't know how exactly to classify this because the food they were serving would be like a fraction of the price in Chinatown, Anywhere USA, but here in Vegas, it was ridiculously expensive.  Yes, the flavors are cleaner, the noodles are fresher, and overall relatively cheaper compared to other restaurants in Vegas, but it's still like double digits for a bowl of wonton noodle soup with shrimp. So I guess that's something to keep in mind.  If you factor in convenience, gorgeous decor ( I could stare at those goldfish tanks for hours...), and very clean, delicious chinese food, then this place will be just the ticket.  My recommendations - beef noodle soup ( delicious collagen broth and hand pulled noodles) and dao miu ( pea tips steamed and stir fried in Garlic).",

Edamame was ice cold, and they didn't even bring a bowl out for the shells - we had to ask. Worst soup dumplings I've ever had. They were way too thick and the soup filling had no flavor. Also had to ask for spoons to properly eat them. BBQ pork buns were mediocre at best. Sui mai and har gau were cold and the skin was too thick. We didn't even buy drinks and that meal was the same price as going out for dim sum twice at home (with drinks!). Don't waste your time or money.",

I have been intrigued when I've walked by Beijing Noodle No. 9 and seen the whiteness of the interior.  It does grab your attention.  Aside from that, I wanted to try their noodles.  This was a four course meal.  For the starter I chose the tomato and egg drop soup.  I haven't seen this combination and it works well.  The tomatoes were partially blanched so they had texture to them and weren't mushy.  The soup was very hot and tasty.  For an appetizer, I chose the spring rolls.  It was three fried rolls with sweet and sour sauce.  They were standard egg rolls.  For the main course, I got the Sichuan Dan Dan noodles.  These are hand pulled noodles with chili oil and minced pork and scallions.  It was very good.  The spiciness was good, but I chose to add a little extra from the small container on each table.   The menu said dessert was a mochi sampler.  It was two pieces of chocolate mochi with raspberry sauce.  Serviced was very good.  The courses were spaced nicely and my iced tea was refilled without asking.  This was a good Restaurant Week choice but the place is expensive due to its Strip location.  For noodles in the future, I'll stick with the shops in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Visiting Beijing Noodle No. 9 was a little bit of a homecoming for me because it's at the same space where I had my first Vegas fine dining experience 15 years ago when it was known as 808, a Pan-Asian fusion restaurant.  Well, Beijing Noodle isn't exactly same restaurant but I had a decent experience here.  I don't see how this place can get less than 3 stars.  It's a very clean and hip looking spot.  The decor with the fish tanks is very eye-popping for a noodle house (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1FsSJd0&s=4e6034ea9342155eb8076a71c2f6bdafed119817a9ddf2c51196531276b33b25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1FsSJd0</a>).  How can you not want to go inside and check it out?  Plus its got an open noodle kitchen which was genius for them to put out in the front so you can see the chefs show off their noodle pulling skills which is almost like a Vegas show in itself (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1MU6Sp7&s=09b44cdd79ca710ddb371e4b5514360461e70f86495644f0dabb5f2c7039f8d1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1MU6Sp7</a>).  It was a total no-brainer for me to sit at the noodle bar to see them work on the noodles from start to finish (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1H4K5IY&s=0d23f41d99601ff0d71741ab087b3186c232b9e430eb793fbd397d4088334f0a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1H4K5IY</a>).  On to the food.  So obviously I came here because I woke up with a craving for noodles.  I opted for the Pork Wonton Noodle Soup with Knife-shaved noodles and ordered a Thai Iced Tea for my drink.  Thai Iced Tea -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1BtOnqQ&s=877e0545317ca1ea06cf3235a9207fc11bd17bc8e540b53a70accfe1f1ce8ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1BtOnqQ</a> It's pretty much your basic Thai Iced Tea.  Nothing too fancy or subtle about it.  But it was a little pricey though at $7.  Beijing Pork Wonton in Chicken Broth with Knife-Shaved Noodles -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1GxRP31&s=c0af3fbedf907a5145453a94bef9cd353c77dc3a5b00b9e3c650911ade86b064\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1GxRP31</a> Even though I was impressed with the chefs making the handpulled noodles, I settled with the Knife-shaved noodles with the Pork Wonton soup.  And just was entertaining as the handpulled noodles were, I was just was impressed seeing the chef shaving off the noodles from a huge hunk of noodle dough into the cooker.  So they were definitely fresh as well.  Overall, the Pork Wontons and Noodles were great.  My issue was that the broth really had no flavor.  I couldn't really taste anything so I had to add extra soy and chili sauce to give it a little kick.  So overall Beijing Noodle No. 9 is a decent casino noodle house.  I came here to satisfy my noodle craving and it did just that with some professional noodle-pulling showmanship as a plus.  I wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes.  It is pricey though but convenient if you have a craving for noodles on the Strip and don't want to take a bus or cab ride to Chinatown.",

    "text": "This was probably the best Chinese food I have ever had.   I am usually not a fan of Chinese food, but this place was something special. The presentation was great, the flavor was amazing, and the price blew me away. For four people, we got the soup dumplings, roasted duck, braised beef shank noodle soup, wok fried shredded duck and pickles in vermicelli soup, stir-fried beef tenderloin with crispy garlic, shrimp fried rice, mochi, and 4 Vietnamese iced coffees, which was plenty of food. For a total of around $40 a person, this was around the same as we would have paid at a buffet, but was so much better.   To address the negative reviews that I've seen: Most of the negative reviews mention ordering things like the General Tso's chicken. I personally wouldn't do that. We didn't go fully traditional in the food we got, but choosing the Americanized dishes will probably be not what you're used to. Yes, we got the shrimp fried rice, and a couple of people mentioned that it didn't taste the way that it comes at most restaurants (like Benihana), but that's because it isn't doused in soy sauce. They really let the flavors of the base food in the dishes come through, and it really shines. While it may not be what we usually get, everyone in our group left the restaurant raving about every dish. The flavor was not bland at all (and I don't have the most refined palate in the world), it just wasn't coated in sugar and soy sauce.  Many of the reviews also mention that the service was bad. We did not have this problem. The servers were attentive and gave us great suggestions. They were accommodating and helpful. We did call the servers over a few times, but I think that's more of a cultural difference rather than a point against their quality of service. However, this didn't interrupt our dining experience and did not feel like we got less quality service then the price point of the restaurant.   All in all, this was an amazing experience and was the highlight of the trip. It isn't the local Chinese restaurant in the town you're from that caters to American tastes because it doesn't have to be, and I'm thankful for that. The entire experience changed my perspective on what Chinese food can be and was nothing short of special.",

I watched him eating his soup and about 30 minutes in to us sitting down I was informed that my dumplings had been given to another table.

Not to mention the thousands of goldfish swimming around int he gigantic tanks. The noodles are good, especially with a good amount of the chili sauce to spice it up. The dumplings are ok, nothing to rave about. Again, great for a stop-by if you are staying here, but I wouldn't go out of my way or make reservations or anything.

    "text": "LOVE the decor.  Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by huge tanks of goldfishes and the amazing thing is the water is really clean. If you ever had any kind of aquarium, you know its hard to keep the water clean and theirs is squeeky clean. The inside is all white and the ceiling is spectacular.  The kitchen is open and you can see the chefs prepare the dishes.  The decoration by the kitchen is very colorful, containers filled with many different spices. The burst of color by the kitchen is the  the only color you will find in this restaurant, except for the goldfishes. The servers are courteous and attentive.  The menu seemed pricey, dumplings being around $10 for 4 pieces.  To get our money's worth we ordered main entrees (15-25 depending on serving size), wanting to try the famous hand pulled noodles that are made fresh (you can watch someone make the noodles near the entrance of the restaurant). We ordered the Chef's handmade noodle with sliced pork and mushrooms, sauteed diced beef and fried rice.  We liked the noodles so much that we ordered a second one.  I thought the food was good but the noodle was the best of the bunch.  We loved the ambiance, the experience and the noodles.  For the price of the food and because of the smaller portions, i don't think we will come back.  I think it is a must try at least once and if I am hankering for fresh hand-made pulled noodles, and I have extra money in my pocket, this wil be the place to go.",

    "text": "From the outside, the restaurant looked cool but once I walked through several large fish tanks full of gold fishes and into the white dining area, it felt like I just stepped into an insane asylum. Maybe I was insane for trying such a pretentious restaurant that I know will serve average food I can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. Oh well, it was too late to turn back and we wanted something light before hitting the road. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised.   Nope, as expected the food was average. We ordered braised beef brisket ($16.00) with handmade noodle and steamed pork buns ($9.00).   Braised beef noodle - The soup was actually good but the noodle was average. With the word \"noodle\" in the name of the restaurant, the noodle was a big disappointment. Also, the beef had a wet towel smell to it.   Steam pork bun - a disappointment as well. The texture of the bun was not firm and was a bit mushy and the pork had no flavor. At $9 for 3 little buns, we were expecting more.   Service was good if this was a hole in the wall joint but when you are charging $16 for noodle soup, the service needs to be stepped up a notch or two.   Everything about this restaurant is pretentious even for LV standards, from the ridiculous gold fish tanks, to the cold decor to the hostess in miniskirt (not complaining here). Noodle is comfort food so it would be nice if the restaurant could have a warmer feel to it.   Recommendation: Don't come here for the food but if you like to look at gold fish, this is the place for you. Also, if you like all white decor, you won't be disappointed here.",

Once I got the fried rice, it was seriously just rice with eggs. The plate was extremely unappetizing and all brown. There wasn't one vegetable in the fried rice. Who doesn't add vegetables to fried rice?? There was absolutely no flavor to the dish. When u cook fried rice, onions and bell peppers generally add flavor to the dish. Apparently the cooks at this kitchen don't know what's up. The Asian food at the Caesar's Palace buffet tasted better than this food. Oh...and don't get the tea. They charge you $15 for 1 small pot of tea!! Are you kidding me?!?  It's freaking tea!!",

Beijing Noodle is a good restaurant with very good (but overpriced) chinese food.  I ate there three times while in Vegas on busienss and not once did I have a bad experience.  Singapore noodles with curry was the perfect mix of curry, vegetables, and sweetness.  Just like I got in Singapore. Though they should say it has shrimp in it on the menu - so folks with allergies like me don't need to send it back.  Next visit I had the beef wontons with handpulled noodles.  Very flavorful broth, tasty wontons, and chewy fresh tasting noodles.  Great dish!  Last visit I just had to order the beijing beef pancake.  I mean, on name alone!  But they were aweseome - remind me of \"chicken in foil\" I used to get back home in Brooklyn chinese restaruants.  Also had the beef in chili oil which was just like your classic spicy szechuan dish and the chicken in clay pot which reminded me of a fried version philipino chicken adobo.  The decor is a bit off for me - I'm not a huge fan of the ultra modern look.  Pretty funny thought that they have to put a sign on the goldfish tank that says \"Not for human consumption.\"  I'd love to hear the genesis of that sign!",

And now it is the first place we take visitors when they are passing through.  My favorites: Either the hand pulled noodles or the Knife cut ones. They are both amazing and different in their own right. I love the eggplant sauce and the pork & mushroom sauce.   On this last visit the server (Tommy) (AMAZING) offered a sampling of all sauces and those two continued to be my favorites.  My husband always orders the shrimp dumplings and the pork dumplings. And I love the bbq pork buns. All three cooked to perfection each time.   Another favorite is the beef fried rice. Very delicate flavors all popping in your mouth.   The soup dumplings are a must, but be warned, they are difficult to eat at first try!   Drink wise it is always the lychee martini. And/or the iced coffee. Depending on who's driving!   This last trip we tried the mochi. Loved them! My favorite flavors were red bean, mango and chocolate. And I always save room for an almond cookie. I think the flaky buttery cookie is the best way to end a fabulous night of food.",

The noodles here are fresh and you can see them making the noodles by hand in the front window all day long. As you would expect in a place like this... the noodle dishes come out lightening quick and the food is above average.   The downside is the high (even for vegas standards) prices. What more would you expect for a restaurant situated in Caesars (smack dab in the middle of the strip). The decorations and ambiance is quite different than most Chinese places as it is quite bright and feels spacious.   So when you are rolling big in Vegas... or a getting comped... or really in the mood for some authentic Chinese food... make your way into Beijing Noodle No. 9!",

They have Vietnamese coffee w/boba, and it comes in a large = awesome, and SUPER strong too! They also have soy milk w/boba and fruit (watermelon, etc)..  prices are between $5-$7.  Their dishes come down to a few options: - beef - pork - soup - rice - noodles   .. but I didn't come across any signature dishes you typically would at a True Chinese restaurant (ie. Pan fried noodles, combination plates like chow fun, etc).  Their white and orange hand blown glasses are really pretty, and the decor is cool too. Service was OK, and the food is cooked fresh. I could tell the noodles in our chow fun were hand made, I'd say those were my favorite of everything we had.  Oh!  the salt and pepper shrimp are yummy too!  Servings are 'A la carte (aka family style)' BUT the portions are smaller than a traditional Chinese place.",

    "text": "Huge disappointment!  I came here with my parents (Jan 2011) as I was craving some Asian food, and this place sounded like they had some great noodles. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The price was high the service was below average, the wait was long, and the food was just okay.  I was hoping for some good Chinese Green Tea as is complimentary at most Chinese Restaurants, however they charged by the person, so I skipped that.  What we ordered:   Singapore Style Rice Noodles ($16.99): The menu had no description, so my family assumed it would be vegetarian. When these noodles came out, they had pork and shrimp. We don't eat pork, so we told our server that we couldn't eat the noodles. He started blaming us for ordering the food, and disappointment sank in. We asked if there was anything that could be done, and he said that he would ask them to make it with just shrimp. We waited for at least 10-15 minutes nibbling on the 'Crispy Chicken' and getting more frustrated as others were being attended to nicely. When the food finally arrived, there was no meat and no flavor. A complete waste of money.  Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon  Noodle Soup ($16.99): The best dish we ordered. Tasted like a beef stew with noodles. Not amazing, but not bad. The beef was nicely cooked and the noodles were pretty good too.  Har Gow, Shrimp Dumplings (4) ($10.99): The dumpling wrapper was too thick in my opinion and it broke easily, holding a small piece of shrimp. Nothing special.  Crispy Chicken in Szechuan Garlic Sauce ($19.99): A small plate of 'crispy chicken' (dry chicken, very thin pieces), with 'garlic sauce' on the side. This was pretty much like Chicken Katsu, and I was not impressed with the Szechuan garlic sauce. Not worth it at all.  At the end, I was hoping to order a boba drink to go, but our server came by with our check before asking if we wanted any desserts or anything else, so I told my parents not to mention it.",

It's not authentic but it was flavorful, particularly the shrimp.  - Spicy pork noodles. Not that great, noodles were nothing special and neither was the pork.  - Steamed veggies were the highlight. Great sauce!  Bottom line not horrible but not awful, clearly not authentic.",

Long & Fishy:    I'd be surprised if you could walk by this place in Caesars and not notice the huge fish tanks filled with hundreds of goldfish, it's unreal.  People stop just to take pictures of the tanks.  We came in to grab some dinner and I have to say I honestly wasn't expecting much based on the yelps I read.  My experience was nothing like everyone else.  Our server was nice and friendly, the menu was big, the atmosphere was ultra cool, and the food rocked.  The one downside was that the food did take a few minutes longer than I expected, but when it did finally come, boy was it worth the wait!  Would I go here again?  If I ever stay at Caesars again, sure.  Should you go here?  Yes, it's pretty darn good Chinese.  , Sam",

I was clearly suckered in by the word \"Beijing\" and the prop noodles in the display case.  Don't be tricked by the random 4 - 5 star review...it's just more props.    The only plus, the scenery is super pretty and I suspect what you're actually paying for is the pretty goldfish in the tanks.",

There was nothing on menu which was vegetarian which was shocking and when finally we ordered noodles and vegetable in schezwan   Sauce what came on the table was even more shocking. There was noodles and chili oil and bak choy.  The meal was very very expensive for just noodles. The server asked in the end to pack the meal as I couldn't eat it because it was too spicy to put in my mouth- she said that \"Oh I thought you are Asian and can eat spicy food\". Yes, I can eat spicy food but not chili oil. Please make sure you ask carefully what you are getting in your meal. Vegetables I understand means vegetables not just Bak choy!!! It is a rip off place unless you have won too much money not to care....for vegetarians it is better for you to go to Earl of Sandwich place which has much better option.",

Since I love hand-pulled noodles, I had to try it.  My colleague and I ordered a few dishes to share.  We tried the beef shank and cilantro roll, pork won-tons in numbing oil, and wok-fried hand-pulled noodles with shrimp.  The beef shank was a bit dry but tasted pretty good - the pancake was thin and rolled up nicely.  The won-tons were plenty numbing from the Szechuan peppercorn oil but the dumplings themselves were tiny and had very little filling.  The shrimp noodles contained a fair number of medium-sized shrimp but that was the only good thing about the dish which was otherwise bland tasting and bland looking, with over-cooked (too soft) noodles.  This place is expensive too - I guess it's not to surprising given its location next to the conference center at Caesar's Palace.",

The wait was 30 minutes, which was fine, but when we got to our table, there were barely people in there. That made me question why we had to wait so long. Perhaps they had too few servers that day, but even that is questionable.  Our family ordered the duck and bbq pork egg noodle soups. I know we didn't order a variation, so it's difficult for me to review the restaurant as a whole. However, these soups were decent, but nothing spectacular. Pretty plain with just noodles, the meat, and a few stalks of Chinese broccoli. The portions were quite large but for the quality, it's not worth the price we paid. Everything in Vegas is expensive, so it's unavoidable, even for a bowl of noodles.  Our server was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is really bright and modern, with walls consisting of overlaying curliques. I was a bit annoyed with the kitchen staff constantly dropping plates, which was really obvious in the otherwise quiet restaurant.  Would only go back if I was craving Chinese food but it's not an amazing experience.",

My friends had chosen it based on convenience, since we were staying in the hotel and were already in need of a nap.  My foodie alarm definitely sounded at this appalling selection.   The service here was very straightforward and certainly not accompanied by a smile.  The food was pretty terrible as well, with most items doused in salt.  The Sweet Red Bean Buns were perfectly moist and stuffed with the dessert-like paste.  This was the sole highlight of the meal.  The Hand-Pulled Noodles were mediocre at best and rather mushy, in actuality.  The Diced Eggplant Sauce that covered the noodles was so salty that no amount of water managed to rehydrate us.  The Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice was unmemorable and similarly salty.  The main feature that this dining establishment has going for it is the futuristic, white decor that makes you feel as if you are in a spaceship.  The beautiful fish tank also enhances the atmosphere.  However, with so many great restaurants in town, Beijing Noodle No. 9 is not worth your time...or even this rhyme!",

We ordered our meals, the vegetable fried rice and the vegetable chow mein, and the were very tasty. The design of the place is very cute, and to add to that there are three large goldfish tanks that add to the fun, classy atmosphere. I'd take a picture of the meal, but it's all gone now! :)",

I think the goldfish tank/ sorta like a wall fixture is neat, but i felt kinda weird eating and seeing all the goldfish all over the place. I cant explain it, just something about it , maybe they didn't need quite so much, but then that would take away from the effect right?  I will agree that the noodles are better than your average lo mien, they are fresher and just taste different but again, nothing spectacular.  Besides the too many goldfish in my face when I'm trying to eat my food, the decor was really nice, very clean and modern.",

The szechuan dun dun noodle was like nothing I ever had before, no peanut/sesame sauce at all, just hot oil.  The cold spicy noodles were different as well, but very good.  Finally, pan fied peking raviolis/pot stickers were excellent, although chive is different than the traditional chinese cabbage.  The service was fast and good.  My only quibble is about $4 for a pot of tea or glass of iced tea.  Seems unnecessarily steep.  Complaining about shark fin soup or coming for the decor is ridiculous.",

Stopped in for some lunch before going to the airport, place was pretty dead for just past mid-day. Service was quick and friendly, prices are high for what you are getting but that may just be the Cesar's way of doing things. Guessing a lower end casino would have had lower prices on food. Eating partner had the beef noodle soup, standard classic, tasty with a decent amount of meat just be warned that this soup is supposed to contain a lot of fat and some tendon so there are chewy bites and bits you will spit out but that is the way it is supposed to be. I had a cold noodle dish, sorry forgetting the name, with veggies and small bits of beef. It was good healthy and refreshing, just wish for ~$20 there was a bit more. In the end a cool spot, especially if you watch the gentleman in the front pull the noodles, worth a try for a snack, but be willing to pay a bit more than I would think is reasonable.",

I have to say that the restaurant in fact is expensive, but nothing completely ridiculous as my husband and I have eaten in restaurants in Santa Barbara with less food and less taste.  I am a pescetarian, so I ordered the sweet and sour fish, the fish filet with black been sauce and the white egg and shrimp fried rice, tea, and white rice (about $90)... needles to say, it was very good, and the fish was very fresh. So, my mom and I came back a second time for lunch.  My mom had the soup, same white eggs and shrimp fried rice and I had the Thai style noodle sea food (which is suppose to be just seafood and curry sauce)... when they brought the noodle it had pork! But they were nice to give us a plate without pork... it took a while, so we ended up taking it to go.  I am sure you can find great Chinese food for less with equal amount of taste, but it was convenient for us as we were staying at Caesar's Palace.",

Incidentally, this Anglo is a former long-time and informed habitue of Silicon Valley noodle places, a frequent Vegas visitor, know my way around Vegas Chinatown, always have a car to get there and know how to get there with vehicle and sanity in one piece.  You can expect luxe decor and I've always found the flavors and food quality quite adequate.   HOWEVER, the prices will be double, there can be a significant wait on weekends at any normal meal time, and the service will be the same authentically haphazard affair as at \"authentic\"  places everywhere else .    I suspect these latter considerations prime many reviewers to be more sour on the food itself than it deserves.     There are some very nice noodle experiences in Chinatown but getting there and back  from your major strip hotel can be an experience for Vegas virgins on a Saturday night.",

Beef Noodle Soup-Not impressed; nothing special; somewhat cold when delivered Szechuan noodles and pork!-Not impressed;not spicy enough;nothing unique War Wonton Noodle Soup-HORRIBLE; no flavor, bad noodles, no flavor in dumplings.  Green Onion Pancake-HORRIBLE-your better off finding your favorite frozen brand.  Came out cold and no flavor chow fun-u can smell the wok heat, but still just ok  -=the best of the night=- Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings-good flavor.  individual bao vary on attention of detail.

My auntie from HI thought it was good.  For those that know you got it good pass this spot up    Bad- Service-The same unattentive service you expect expect in chinatown.  Waiters need training and more discipline.  It does not look good to stand around playing on your phone or speaking overly loud where customers can hear your conversations.    Hostesses-not very host like these girls need replacing.  Do some work other than just standing up front and then ducking in the back  I came here for the hand made noodles and thus put in an order and informed only after I ordered that there were none available.  I then asked the waiter to inform me when the chef was making more so we could put in an order.  NOPE had to spot the chef making more and flag down our waiter to order.  Sure, hand tossed tasted better than store bought, but not at the price.",

Daughter took a slightly spicy (they say) beef with hand pull noodles that burned her mouth.  I was luck with the safe chicken and mushrooms and hand pull noodles.   Basically, we will not come back never ever!   Take pictures, but go eat somewhere else.",

Their \"pancakes\" are pretty decent but their best dishes are their noodles. Their hand pulled noodles are super fresh and their broth offerings are straight out of China. Definitely one of the better authentic Chinese restaurants on the strip! Also, it's rumored that their new (head, possibly not) chef is from Malaysia which specializes in Hainan chicken, so if if you see this, definitely order it.  Service: 7/10  Pretty standard service, nothing out of the ordinary. Very attentive and helpful when you need it! Overall: 7/10 Additional Notes: Great place to come when you're looking for some authentic Chinese flavor. Also open 24/7 which is equally important in Vegas.",

All of the  noodle soup dishes were spectacular. My only negative remark is that they're plain noodle dishes were very lacking lackluster and poorly comprised. The Dan Dan noodle was the only one that's halfway decent. The few others were extremely oversalted with no balance. On top of these beautiful light and airy and wonderful noodles they put a clump of some very dense and assertive preparation. My suggestion is that they put together a pork or chicken or any protein with any number of simple seasoning's.",

    "text": "After glancing at the ratings for Beijing Noodle Company No. 9 (BNC) it seems like writing this review is tantamount to \"piling on\". But write it I must. We've been to BNC many times (don't ask), so I feel qualified to talk about the food and service at this establishment.  In total, if you are staying at Caesar's and need a solid place to eat, BNC is a good option. But this is not a place to travel to if you have transportation and options. There are just too many quality noodle experiences to be had in this town.   DECOR The look of the place is captivating. It's worth stopping by to look at the design and creative use of color and space. The walls in the entire space are covered in white \"lace-like\" designs layered over lights and a flat white wall. The layering effect makes a relatively small space look and feel much larger than it is--there is an expansive feel that smaller spaces in casinos could only wish to have.  Even the low ceilings are covered in the deceptively inviting lace-like netting. In addition, the huge fishbowl entry way and glassed in noddle-making area add to an expansive and welcoming feel to the entire space.    Over the years, they have failed to keep the place clean and tidy. If you glance at the floorboards and fixtures, the scuffing, layers of dust, and disrepair are all too apparent. And this beautiful minimalist/ornate design requires that it be kept in prestige condition. So even though the decor and design are a showpiece, there seems to be little concern with maintaining their appeal.   SERVICE  The service was solid on our last visit. We've had varying levels of service, but that is True of any location.  On a bad night, the service will be spotty: we've seen them get very busy and been forgotten by the wait staff. Even on good nights, there will be a bit of a wait for drink refills, but even then the food always comes out hot.   FOOD Sadly, it's bland. On our last visit, we ordered: shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, green onion pancakes, Beijing Zha Jiang with Hand Pull Noodle, General Tso's Chicken (sigh), and Ma Po Tofu. The seasoning was an issue for the two dishes I was most looking forward to:  the Beijing Zha Jiang and the tofu. Both were just bland. I would say that they were crafted to appeal to an American pallet, but I have an American palette and I was craving flavor. Salt and sweet dominated the chicken dish and the pork buns and pancakes were unnecessarily mild. The hand-pulled noodles are always fantastic, but unfortunately they do not save the dishes at BNC.    SUMMARY There is a promise and illusion of beauty that is never quite fulfilled. From the design to the food, BNC has the potential to be something greater than it is. I just don't think it is interested in the challenge.",

    "text": "DISCLAIMER: I'm Chinese. I love food. So this review is going to be a generally harsher review - I WILL rate this according to what actual Chinese food is like.   1. Overpriced  But this is Caesars Palace after all. So just go knowing that. 18 dollars averagely per plate.   2. Food was very American Chinese. Not at all authentic.  I had a hand pulled brisket noodle. The noodles were fresh but not very spongy and a bit flat and too thick. The soup was lacking in stock and had a layer of oil on top that was unnecessary and just made the dish oily and not tasty in the right way. But I will say that the beef brisket itself was tender enough.  I also had the Pork Soup Dumpling which was decent. The Pork inside was flavourful but the Dumpling itself was too thick and lacked sophistication.   The environment is pleasing - contemporary looking and with goldfish aquariums inside.   3. Service  Is not great. It's alright. But not great. We had finished our meals for 15 mins already and no one came to get out plates.   CONCLUSION I'm giving this 1 star for the decor and the beef brisket itself.",

Even this place, I had to be in line for more than 30 minutes to sit at the bar. I ordered a shrimp chow mein and salt and pepper chicken because I didn't want to read the thick booklet menu. I chose panda express style items and expected the taste as panda's as well. I was starving enough to appreciate if the food was editable.  While i was waiting for my food, i was watching the noodle soup open kitchen. An old man was non stop making hot noodle soup. The way he cuts the noodle with his long finger nails, the way he dips his thumb in the soup, the way he touches order paper, wet towel, and food back and forth, I was loosing my appetite already.  I finally got my food, the cold bread crumb sized fried chicken pieces tossed in sodium spice. Seriously, garnished green onion pieces were bigger than the chicken pieces. Also the chow mein was served cold, soaked in oil.   It has been a great while, having this nasty chinese food since I was in college.  And later that night, I had a stomache, and I threw up. Oh wow, thinking about this place makes me feel like throwing up again...",

Very busy even though earlier on a Sunday night so we had about an hour wait by the time we arrived at 530pm, but they can text when your table is ready so you can go gamble away some money to pass time.  Beautiful ambience with modern white theme and an aquarium at the entrance that make the small space bright and airy.  Salt and pepper shrimp and scallion pancakes were both delicious.  Pork belly probably one of the best things on the menu with tons of flavor without too much grease.  Beef noodle soup was just average in terms of flavor but the hand pulled noodles definite  raised it up a notch  in terms of texture. Fish congee was decent.

Debated for a while eating there due to the bad Yelp reviews but ultimately ended up eating here three times in two days.  I can see two reasons for the 2 star rating: (1) hostesses are terrible and really slow to seat people despite the large amount of tables available; (2) restaurant is not super clean.  That being said, this place is pretty authentic. My boyfriend is Chinese and we live in San Francisco so I am a pretty good judge of Chinese food. Ordered a couple of the noodle dishes, mapo tofu, and the green onion pancake. All were really tasty! Waiters were all very polite and the food came out quickly.  Yes, this place is 'overpriced' but so is everywhere else in Vegas. In general a good spot and they are open for 24 hours.",

    "text": "OMG, the reviews of this establishment are DEAD WRONG. This awesome spot is open 24 hours a day right smack dab in the middle of the amazing Caesars Palace. Not too big and not to small, we came in late night for a bite. In all honesty, I was a bit hungover from the night before. I ordered the dumplings, they are made to order, by hand and took a little longer to hit the table. My family ordered two beef stew, Kung Pao Chicken (no peanuts) and a pancake wrap. Excuse me that I don't remember the fine details. It's Vegas, I had a bit too much fun the night before and I really wanted to crawl back into bed.  When our food came, literally- the heavens opened and the choir of angels sang. My dumplings were amazing little purses of flavor. My sister was able to share a slice of this pancake that immediately made me regret my choice as well. The stew, with it's hand pulled noodles, rich beefy broth soothed me. And my dad, his Kung Pao chicken.. to die for. I came to life. Suddenly, I was okay and thought to myself, this is a bit of heaven. I wish I had ordered more.  After getting home, I found a few celebrity/ food network shows that had visited and sang praises to this place. They were right on the money. If you want, authentic Chinese cuisine- go here and take a chance. They take pride in making food that pleases your soul. No, it's not American-ized. It's good Northern Chinese food, done right and good in a small, but delicious space. The staff is super friendly (my sister had fun taking photos of the girls making noodles) and willing to help you choose something you will like. No shortcuts. Seriously good food made from scratch, authentic and they don't mind if you want a few tweaks to fit your taste. Relax, good food takes a little more time so use those extra minutes to smile, talk to your friends and just breathe. Vegas is so fast pace... this place is certainly a \"stop and smell the roses/ dumplings\" place. Nearly impossible to leave unhappy.",

    "text": "This was quite the SURPRISE. Prior to settling with eating here, my sister read the reviews to me and it appeared to be ranked at a terrible rating. In fact, they were making me kind of nervous on trying this place out. We were extremely hungry and it was getting pretty late, and my mom wanted Asian food, so we said let's do it. I AM SO GLAD WE DID. I am not a huge fan of Asian food but WOW. Everything that we ordered was DELICIOUS. Although a little over priced, everything here is way above than any Chinese Takee Outee. I ordered the Beijing Honey BBQ Pancakes and I cannot begin to describe the delightful flavors that I was experiencing. I have never tasted anything like this and it was amazing! My sister ordered dumplings and my father ordered the Kung Pao Chicken, and even though those are simple common Asian fares, THIS PLACE MADE THEM THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER HAD (Other than my mom of course haha.) GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY, You'll pay more here for what you are getting, but IT'S WORTH IT!",

Service can definitely use an improvement",

The entire staff is obviously overworked here. The guy who was supposed to serve our table was supposedly on break but he was still serving other tables, just not ours. In our defense, we didn't have the chance to even offend anyone yet as we had only JUST sat down. Difficult as hell to get anyone's attention. When we did finally get one lady's attention, she stuck out her hands to her sides as if to say \"I have nothing.\" and literally said \"What?\" We were surprised. What the hell was her problem? We asked if someone could take our order. Someone does and a while after, our first item comes out. It's supposed to be the \"Beijing Zha Jiang Noodle\" but it turns out to be their \"Dan Dan Noodles\". Good GOD it was difficult to try and get that sorted out. The names sound similar and the damn dishes look similar but we knew we had received Dan Dan instead of Zha Jiang. FINALLY they gave us the right dish. At this point, we were really annoyed. I was sad to taste the Zha Jiang because it ended up being damn delicious. Lol. It's different from Korean style ja jang myun (korean take on Zha Jiang)- more fermented bean paste and chunkier pieces of meat. The dumplings we ordered were nothing to write home about. After the shit show with our order, we grabbed a waitress to ask WHO our actual waiter/waitress was since we weren't getting any service. This waitress, Belia, ended up taking over our table even though it wasn't hers and kept checking up on us. She was nice and helpful. I'd rate the food as 4.5/5 but the whole staff is just so overworked and it was such a fiasco that I wouldn't come back. Eh.",

I see most of the bad reviews complained about overpricing, but it's Vegas, and it's a restaurant located inside a resort in Vegas! We can't expect Chinatown price over here. I think the price is reasonable and the food tastes good enough to match the price. Especially loved the Beijing style beef pancake, the duck meat fried rice, and the string beans with eggplants. The meat in the zha-jiang noodle was too salty but the noodle itself was decent. The place looks very clean and modern BTW.",

I think I literally tried everything on the menu and nothing really impressed me except the hot and sour soup. All the other foods just tasted like typical Chinese food...except it's expensive (for a Chinese food)   The interior is odd but unique. The front entrance pathway is filled with a goldfish tanks and the whole restaurant is white. When I dined in at the restaurant, I didn't think the food was as good as when I got room service.

Perhaps a child was eating here before me?  Perhaps they just hadn't swept all day?  I'll give them a pass on that one though.  I started with the hot and sour soup.  This was my favorite dish of the meal.  Mushroom, tofu, and shrimp in broth.  For my main course I had the beef with asparagus.  This was alright.  The beef was tender.  The asparagus was large, fresh, and crisp.  I had a side of pork pot stickers.  These were oily and bland.  Not my favorite.  I had some hot tea with the meal also.  Jasmine I believe.  I had tried the dragon berry cocktail.  It was a mojito-esque drink with a Sprite base and muddle mint leaves, lime, and blackberries.  I would recommend.  My waiter was very friendly and attentive.

The Kung Pao chicken with peanuts wasn't even chicken as you don't even know what this meat was it was a weird texture and not tasty at all.  We also had some noodles which was disgusting absolutely disgusting did notbraste like any noodles we ever had. And shrimp fried rice, the rice wasn't even fried it was like soft and the shrimp wasn't even cooked it was like raw shrimp from a shrimp cocktail so nasty.   SHAME ON YOU CESEARS PALACE for allowing this establishment on your property. Maybe you should take some notes from the MGM properties. We had no choice but to go to this place because all the good restaurants at Caesar's Palace we're closed from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. how inconvenient is that!",

    "text": "Wow. Where do I start. Maybe I should've known better when I saw on Yelp that they only had 2.5 stars, but I believe everyone deserves a chance so I decided to give it a try.   First, there was a line for the hostess stand to put my table and name down. When it finally came to my turn, some lady barged in from the side of the hostess stand and demanded to put her name down. I don't know what's worse- the fact that the hostess still put her name down anyways and didn't tell her off, or the fact that the lady thought it would be acceptable to cut in front of a huge line of people.   Next, we waited for our table (30 min) and when we ordered, we requested the \"hand pulled noodles\" which is what they're known for. So of course we had to try it. Now, we were told there would be a bit of a wait and that's fine.   Another 35 minutes of waiting for our food and tons of other tables after us enjoying their food, a lady named Rene or something came to apologize and said she would check up on our order. Then she comes back and lies to us by saying that they are currently \"freshly hand pulling\" the noodles right now.   After waiting a WHOLE HOUR and tons of tables around us started to leave and a new batch of people came in, we for frustrated so I waved and attempted to call Rene over to ask to just check out and pay for our appetizer so we can just leave. She saw me TWICE waving my hand and she completely ignored me because she didn't want to deal with me. She knew we were upset so she'd rather just avoid us. TERRIBLE.   So we just slapped $10 on the table for the appetizer we ate and walked out. As I walked out, I saw that the noodle making station was not being used (aka Rene lied to us about someone making fresh noodles for us. Nobody was pulling noodles at all.)   TLDR; thanks for wasting 1.5 hours of my day to walk out on an empty stomach and thanks for the crap customer service.",

    "text": "Pro-Tip: If you are staying at Caesars Palace, do not be lazy and order from room service from here. Just get up and get take out! It is not worth 3X the price!  We had just gotten back to our hotel from our day trip to the Grand Canyon and driving all day when we decided to look through the Caesars room service. There was a tab for late night bites which included menu from Beijing Noodle No. 9. We started looking at the entrees and the price and decided to look at the menus posted on Yelp to compare prices. Oh myyyyy when we saw that they were 1/3 of how much we were going to spend on room service, I decided putting on my pants and walking five minutes with no makeup on and tired eyes was worth it. The restaurant is famous for its massive gold fish tanks that you walk through into the restaurant.  Now the food...this was probably my least favorite meal of our trip to Vegas but it wasn't bad. The food was good though, the tso's and Thai tea tasted pretty good and I would give them a 4 stars otherwise. The steamed dim sum is the only item I wouldn't recommend. We ordered Steamed BBQ pork buns($14),two Thai teas($7 each), and two orders of General Tso's($17 each) and I thought the rice was free but actually they were $4 per cup.... like i know Vegas is expensive and all but $70 for what we can get at home for $25 is crazy!  This was us NOT getting the room service prices either...I can't even imagine... Good food when you're tired and don't care about price.",

The total cost of the food was $97 and the result is terrible tasting food. Not worth the price. We never mind paying for expensive eats but this food is not good. We ate it but now I feel sick. The ribs had a weird flavor it had a hint of vinegar and sweet taste. The asparagus beef was too salty but the meat was tender. The fried rice had white meat chicken but the flavor of it was just soy sauce. I told Christina a waitress about our experience and she was very nice about it. She offered us free desert  for our experience. She was very pleasant. We did try two of the mochi and it was good. I would not recommend this place to eat. We know what good eats are and we have a fine tasting palate. Save yourselves some trouble and skip this place if you want good eats.",

If you go here during normal dinner hours you might want to make reservations otherwise you will have to wait to be seated, like us. Hostess told us the wait will be 30-45 min, we ended up only waiting about 25 min.. the wait staff was very pleasant and attentive.  We ordered soup dumplings, which our son got as his dinner; fried rice and sweet and sour chicken; pork ribs caramelized in vinegar. Food came out promptly and was good. Prices are pretty expensive if you probably compare them to a local Chinese food joint wherever you live, but I think by Vegas strip prices aren't too bad.

We were shocked when we received the bill and each tiny bowl of white rice was $7 - apparently, rice is charged a la carte. After ordering, receiving your food takes an unexpectedly long time. The service was great, though.  For $18, the portion size of the the General Tso's was insultingly small and looked/tasted like they just dumped hoisin sauce on it. However, The Mongolian Beef ($23.99) was delicious. Robust and flavorful with tender slices of beef and a portion size worthy of the price.   Overall, a decent experience, but nothing to write home about. WAY more expensive than I would have liked. Could have eaten at the famous all you can eat Bachannal Buffet right next door for the very same cost, if only I'd had the patience to wait in line for an hour.",

    "text": "I usually don't like to go to Chinese restaurants inside fancy hotels, but since I was already staying here and I was feeling a bit under the weather with a bit of a throat problem (non-contagious!), I thought since all the other restaurants in the hotel had pretty rich and spicy dishes on their menus, that a simple bowl of fish congee or soup noodles would be perfect. I went for the seafood and dumpling egg noodle soup. Since they seemed to be displaying the noodle station at the front of window of the restaurant, I figured this must be one of their specialties.  Oh boy. The soup was kind of tasteless, the noodles were ok, but a very small portion, the 2 shrimp and 2 scallop were large and fresh, but the dumpling......what the....?!?!? I think it was supposed to be some kind of wonton dumpling, but I took one bite and noticed a really dark stuffing in it....not sure what was inside, but it was cold! I was too hungry to complain and send it back, so I just left the dumplings til the end hoping that the warm (not hot) soup would warm it them up a bit.  And this for $20+?! Yikes.....I guess if I had taken a cab to Chinatown for the same bowl of noodles, the cab fare, bowl of noodles, tax and tip would have likely come to the same amount. The quality definitely wasn't worth that much, but I guess the rent must be pretty high.  I was thinking of going back at dinner time to try the fish congee, but then changed my mind after some thought. Ok, so it's probably a bit unfair to judge a restaurant based on a bowl of noodles....but then again, I don't think I want to press my luck a second time. If you're truly desperate for something to eat and can't think of any other decent place, then ok, it's probably edible quality. However, I would have preferred to take a cab to Chinatown....or even Panda Express across the road.  The service wasn't bad, but pretty much typical of any Chinese restaurant. Nice decor though....I'll give them that. I had a bad experience staying at this hotel so I will likely not come back here again.",

You could tell the noodles were made fresh right there. We sat at the bar, so it was fun watching them manipulate the noodle dough.  The only thing is if you sit there, you will be close to the banging of the dough on the counter. The noise can get piercing, but it's worth watching.",

The restaurant features very extensive selection of traditional Chinese dishes, including large selection of noodles-based dishes. When you order food, you get a choice of using pre-made noodles, or asking for the noodles freshly made right in front of your eyes - similar bad experience as traditional sushi restaurant. I had seafood noodle soup  Shangai style, and it was delicious - perfect amount of spice, not too salty, flavorful broth, honest amound of seafood with fresh shrimp and scallops. Also had a selection of Mochi for dessert - delicious, especially the red bean (vanilla and green tea were excellent too). All in all, excellent meal at a very reasonable price for the prime Las Vegas casino.  Friendly and helpful service.  Definitely recommended.",

The service is spotty (may forget about you for a while), the menus are a bit tattered, the place could be cleaner, and the food is not remotely on par with the price, although not bad.  I don't really recommend the seafood chow menu, but the tea seems decent (at lest not flat or bad).  Main perk is that it's open 24/7 and that the service is not terrible. Also, they're unable to split the bill between a hotel bill credit for food and any amount you might want to charge to credit (rather than room).",

We were staying at Caesars so we thought this would be a good stop.  First off, the restaurant is decorated with fish tanks with goldfish everywhere. It was cool at first but then it started getting trippy and then started making me nauseous and dizzy (not good for those who are hungover).  We told our waiter that we had a flight to catch so we had to make it snappy. There were 6 of us so we ordered a handful of dishes to share:  +chicken soup +mapo tofu +beef with broccoli +kung pao chicken +seafood noodles  Rice was extra so we had to order a few bowls of white rice. The dishes were nothing fancy, nothing special. The portions were not as big as a lot asian restaurants and were priced a little higher but nothing too surprising... its Las Vegas in the Caesars Palace.",

Maybe I'm spoiled by living near San Francisco and having easy access to good, cheap Chinese food.  Kung pao chicken was average at best.  The sauce for ma po tofu was kind of unusual underneath the chili and spices.  And $2 for a small bowl of rice per person? Wow.     The one thing I didn't mind about this place were the noodles.  They had a nice texture, but unfortunately the broth was lukewarm.      Overall, not a place I would go to again.  Honestly, Panda Express may have been a better idea.",

We ordered two dishes: first, \"crispy chicken with hot sauce\", $19, well, what I got was one piece of breaded & fried chicken breast on a plate (no sauces, no veggies) and one cup of dipping sauce that was mildly hot, if you excuse the oxymoron.  I wouldn't consider that prepared food.  The second dish was a pork dish with cilantro (also in the neighborhood of $20).  The pork this time was cooked with some sauce and sprinkled with cilantro stems.  Out of curiosity, I asked why stems, and what do they do with the leaves.  The answer I got was that \"it's Beijing style, we throw away the cilantro leaves\".  Pretty good comeback I have to say, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the food was plain bad.  Did I mention overpriced?  Yes, even for Las Vegas standards.  We weren't hungry so we decided to skip the buffet experience, but if we were to go to Bellagio buffet for example we would have paid less overall, and enjoyed better food.",

If your selling an upscale product to affluent customers, at LEAST speak in a polite manner and don't toss the menu's at your patrons.  SERIOUSLY I get that service in Chinatown all the time but not at a $20 a pop wannabe-upscale-noodle place  So after the nightmare, we try the noodles.  To my surprise ... it TOTALLY SUCKS.

    "text": "Cloud 9.    When you are inside, you literally feel like you're in the sky.  The interior decor is gorgeous!  I love the white metal artsy walls.  It is definitely very unique!  The only thing I don't like is the gold fishes.  When I first saw this place, the gold fishes freaked me out because there were too many.  I honestly would never had came in here if it wasn't for my fiance.  I'm sure glad that we made reservations here because the interior decor alone was all worth just being in there.  So, 1 star goes to the interior  So, we came here for a family dinner on Christmas day.  There were 18 of us.  They split the group into two.  We had no trouble with getting seated.  They have plenty of tables to accommodate to anyone.  The second star goes to some of the food that I ate.    The food was not as impressive and was a little bland.  I also expected the food to be better since it is in the Caesar's Hotel.  My family ordered 1 small and 1 large Pork Noodle Bowls, 2 plates of Duck, 1 Braised Beef, 3 plates of dumplings, Fried Rice, Chinese Broccoli, and some other cold dishes.  The total all came out to be over $250.   All the dishes range from $15-30 dollars.  Again, nothing really wowed me, especially considering the price of each dish.  I was super excited to try the Pork Noodles Bowl because I heard that they Handmade their noodles, but I was disappointed.  The noodles were good, but the flavor was bland.  However, the only thing I really liked out of all the dishes was the Pork Noodle Bowl (small $15, Large $25), which says a lot.  The dumplings were okay too, not the best that I have ever tried.  I was especially sad when I ate the duck.  Duck is my favorite meat and it just tasted too clean.  Normally, chinese duck is full of yummilicious oily greasy flavor, but not this one.     The portion for each dish is small, so we had to order multiples of each dish to feed a family of 9.  The service was decent.  Our waiter was really nice, but put down the Small for our dishes even though we explicitly told him that we were eating family style.  Due to this mishap, our family had to order more and the large dishes of all the small dishes that we got, which came out to more $$.    Overall, sadly to say.. I would not come here again for chinese food, especially when considering the price, portion, and flavor.  Not the best that I have tried.",

Didn't come with chili oil as I asked, and only came with 6 dumplings for almost 20 bucks.

Chronically understaffed. - Often a line to get in.  Even when it's not full.  And then you get cut-off by the Seven Stars / Diamond members, adding to your wait.

I've ordered appetizers to noodles and rice dishes to take out only and my food expectations were met each time.    One star for their service! I understand Chinese folks aren't the warmest and fuzziest..I'm Chinese myself and know that service is not something our culture strive on. However, being that this restaurant is part of Caesar Palace's restaurants, I had higher expectations that their wait staff and front end staff would provide a nicer dining experience. I was wrong.   The hostess, a young Chinese gal appeared to hate her job. As the hostess, I would imagine someone who at the very least says hi or greets the customer in some fashion with maybe, just maybe a smile. No, not this one. She appeared upset and just not happy overall. People leaving would say good bye and she would look at them and look away without a response. So odd, so weird, so unhappy, so she should probably get another job outside of the hospitality industry.  Waitstaff are rude and seems bothered when you ask for hot chili sauce, give you the side eye when you ask for a hot water refill for your teapot.  It won't stop us from going back though because the food is good even though service sucks, it's tolerable.",

    "text": "When you walk by this place in Caesars, you are automatically intrigued by the bright lighting, modern decor, fish tanks, and live demonstration of handmade noodles, but looks are deceiving when it comes to Noodle No. 9. Where to start...  Service was horrible and slow. There are slight communication barriers as well, which do not help the experience. Waitresses were running around aimlessly like a chicken with its head cut off, so I suggest having all orders ready when attended to because who knows when you will be again. Although you may be even ready with your order because it takes them forever to get to you in the first place.   Don't expect much from the food too. Noodle soups and dishes were amazingly bland and tasteless. Food came in reasonable large portions, but when you factor in the taste, you pay too high a price for below average Chinese food. I did enjoy my shui mai appetizer, whether they were freshly made or not, they were pretty good... and huge too, it was shui mai on steroids!  They also have a good selection of teas. We got the Thai iced tea, and although it is known for its sweetness, this tea was over the top way too sweet. We also ordered one of the Jasmine iced teas with boba. Their iced teas are refreshingly sweet, a cup of that to go while you are walking in the 100 degree desert weather isn't such a bad idea.   Overall, try this place at your own risk, but you have been forewarned and have a high chance of walking out disappointed.",

The beef with hand pull noodle tasted delicious, but there was no beef only gristle. Two thumbs down.",

    "text": "My husband and I liked eating at this place. First of all, the food was good! I am comparing it with what I had in Beijing and Hong Kong, so that's how I conclude. They hand pulled their own noodles, make their own dumpling skins and knife shredded their own noodles, and the qualities of the noodles are high. I don't care that it's a pricey place when the high quality is delivered.  We ordered Xiao Long Bao and Lan Zhou La Mein with Knife Shredded Noodle instead of Hand Pulled Noodle. The noodle was awesome. The noodle texture was just like what I had in Beijing. The Xiao Long Bao was awesome too, the skin was so thin and there was a lot of juice inside each of them. And each was huge too!  The service was good too. Everyone was polite and nice. And I like the fact that they don't always come asking if we are okay, as that's actually not good for us Chinese to be asked for too many times, asking too often is a gesture of rushing someone to leave instead. So if you are in a Chinese restaurant and you are not always asked whether you are doing fine, it's not because they are ignoring you, they are actually letting you to have your space, take your time to relax and chill. I do notice that they always keep an eye out for every table to see if anyone is waving their hand asking for help. So that's a good service for us already. We could actually wave anyone to come and assist us, we didn't have to wave to the same person who took our order. That's what I like in a good Chinese restaurant.  As being born and raised in Hong Kong, and have been in Beijing eating all over, I consider this place delivering high quality Beijing style noodles and Shanghai Xiao Long Bao.  After we finished our meal, we stood outside and watched the old chef making hand-pulled noodle, and watched his assistant making the knife-shredded noodle. The old chef did make the hand-pulled noodle very nicely. Nice hands and skills. We also saw another assistant chef making dumpling further inside the kitchen. We were happy with what we ate and with the experience. (we went by the previous night and watched a younger chef making hand-pulled noodle; I think the older chef's skills was way better than the younger chef, which makes sense as the older chef has more experience than the younger chef does)  We admit that the price is expensive, but again it's not something we eat every day for every meal, it's okay to pay the price to get high quality food. At least cheaper than flying to Beijing to satisfy our crave of Beijing style Knife-Shredded noodle or Hand-Pulled Noodle. Both kinds of noodles are good, I just personally like Knife-Shredded noodle more because of its shape. You can get probably something with the same name off the strip with cheaper price, but they just don't taste good or authentic (meaning not the same as what I had in Beijing) at all, then what's the point for them being cheap if they don't even taste right.  We will go back again.  Note: they offer Total Reward price ($1-2 cheaper for each item) when dining with your Total Reward card. Harrah knows how to do business. This makes me dine more at his properties more than at MGM's. I got discount dining at some other places that are in Harrah's properties, too. And they gave each of us $10 dining credit for just joining Total Reward the first time. So we had $20 free to spend on dining.",

That's how they trap you so you will gamble endlessly since there's no way out!).. anyways, walking around, starving.. my stomach was digesting itself..  suddenly.. i see FISH.. lots and lots of them..  ohhhh pretty fish tank, let's eat here!   Sat down.. kinda dig the decor, very avant garde, I like it!  when I got my food, I immediately regret being lured in by goldfish...   We ordered the seafood dumplings and some kind of chow fun soup noodle. My dumplings were the worst dumplings I ever had. I'll admit, I am a dumpling snob. Growing up we made dumplings every sunday. It's in my blood I can make it with my eyes closed. But these are just really, really bad, almost inedible food! The meat filling was mushy and disgusting.. the skin was thick and undercooked and overcooked at the same time. (still uncooked inside but the outside was mush). Noodles were bland and boring..   PLEASE don't eat here.. I don't want anyone else to endure the same pain I did..   Chinatown is only about 10 minutes car ride away, the restaurant upstairs has good dumpling! Or.. if anything.. go to Panda Express...   pure bad food :\\",

It was like Beef and Broccoli, but with asparagus instead of the broc. Very bland and flavorless. Had to heap on the chili sauce to enhance the flavor.   Others in my group had the mushroom & poor noodle dish. The noodles were very good, but the mushroom sauce was just mediocre. Another dish we shared was the fried eggplant sauce. These were limp and soaked in oil. The flavor was fine, but there just wasnt much going on with this dish.  We had 3 iced teas at a whopping $5 each!!! As well as a side (1 cup) of steamed rice ($3). The final bill was $80. Ouch. I wasn't even full. We used a $50 food voucher and and I STILL felt like I overpaid.   I would rather eat Panda Express and I don't even like that place.  If you are in Caesar's, come here and watch the chefs make fresh noodles and check out the decor. It's a super unique finish. But then keep moving...Vegas has too many great options to bother with this spot.",

But I headed around the corner anyway. I saw the line for the buffet and immediately turned around to try those noodles.   Honestly I'm surprised by the bad reviews. I was a party of 1, and sat at the back bar. I ordered the Cold noodles with cucumber and beef. It came with a quite spicy peanut sauce (if you don't like spicy, this isn't for you).  I also ordered the Xiao Long Bao.   Xiao Long Bao were average. Which is fine. I enjoyed them and would order them again. I do love Xiao Long Bao.  But the noodles. Wow, never had a noodle like that in my life. It was a beautiful thing. The guy making the noodles is an artist. Amazing texture and so so fresh. I've never had any noodle like that and I LOVE noodles. I wish I could find something like that here in my home town of Chicago. If you like spicy food, I would recommend the cold noodles. A thing of beauty. Really. I loved it.",

My BF had been putting up with my its-my-first-time-in-vegas-i-need-to-eat-only-the-best phase (sorry, honey!) and woke up Sunday morning with a taste for peanut noodles.  This man LOVES peanut sauce.  And when he craves it, it's like my bad sushi cravings, I want to get this man some peanut noodles!!!  So, I find Beijing Noodle whatever in the Vegas TO GO book and we decide we will stop there for lunch.  I should've tried to find a menu first.    When we finally got there, we opted to sit at the noodle bar rather than wait 20 minutes for a table, because we were both starving by that point.  It was fun to watch the chef hand stretch the noodles, and I told my BF, look! they're hand stretched, they're going to be so delicious!!  Plusses + Hand stretched noodles were indeed delish.  I had the mushroom/pork sauce.  It should've been called mushroom/egg sauce with hints of pork, and I had to add chili sauce (available at the bar, assumingly for a reason :P) but the noodles had good texture.  Minuses - no peanut noodles.  the BF had chow mein, which he said he enjoyed, but was sad there was no option for him to have hand-stretched. - service was sluggish and disinterested.  Next time we are in Vegas, we'll try one of the other casual places to find my man some peanut noodles!",
