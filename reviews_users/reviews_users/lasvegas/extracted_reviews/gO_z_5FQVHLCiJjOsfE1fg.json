The atmosphere is wonderful, high ceilings, open space, waterfalling behind the bar...very cool.   The staff was amazingly attentive, paying attention to what we ordered, and suggesting dishes that would compliment.  Gerry, our waiter even made a point to special order me some lamb chops....WOW!  I cannot exactly tell which meat was my favorite...My wife said the Tri Tip was the best, but the chimichurri sauce made them all beyond words delicious.  Forget the other Brazillian Steakhouses and go here.",

I have eaten here numerous times over the years, and I keep coming back - the management is hands on and efficient, the servers and other staff are attentive and friendly, and the quality of the food is excellent. I always enjoy the selection of various foods at the salad bar, and it is far more than just salad - from lobster bisque to prosciutto, the selection is always great. And the variety of cuts of meat, as well as the side dishes, is the best! The meat servers are always attentive about coming to your table with the meat skewers and ready to give you as many cuts of meat as you like. The staff at the bar is fun and friendly, and the management always stops by your table to ensure you are satisfied and have been taken care of. I would recommend Via Brasil to anyone interested in casual dining, a formal night for a date, or a family affair or event. Regardless of your reason for visiting you will leave well taken care of and happy!",

This place is very open and well lit with a bunch of windows bringing in the natural light.  Hubby was super happy that there was a huge television that was playing the football game..   The food was great!  We were seated right by the kitchen so we pretty much had first dibs on any meats that came in the dining area.  So yummy!  I piled all the different types of meats on to my plate and just feasted!  They had a salad bar with different types of salads.  They also had a cheese plate on the salad bar and they had a super yummy butternut squash soup.  I tried not to fill myself on salad bar items because I really wanted to enjoy the various meats they were bringing by..   The staff was super accommodating.  They were always ready and willing to answer any question we had and to help us in any way.    The toddler isn't a huge meat eater, but she enjoyed the sides that they provided us at the table.  She loved the bread and rice and broccoli.    This definitely a place I'd love to visit again when in Vegas.",

The manager ( Ana ) was super annoying, we didn't have a chance to finish our salad and she was asking if we have any request for the meats. All I wanted was to enjoy my wine and salad before starting the meats, but every 5 minutes she was on our table trying to get some request from us. Super pushy! Made me feel like she didn't want us to be there. She was annoying the other 4 tables next to mine with the same thing, asking REQUESTS. The Restaurant wasn't busy at all and one thing that I saw that grossed me out was, the same manager ( Ana ) made one of our meat servers clean the floor because he dropped some blood from the meat in the floor. Then she made him come back and serve us. That for me was the end of the line! Health department should take a look at this. If she does this in the front of the house, can you imagine what goes on in the back?  The good news is that FOGO DE CHAO will open a Restaurant in Summerlin really soon. Now locals will have the REAL Brazilian steakhouse experience & enjoy ourselves  like we deserve, for almost the se Price.",

I made a point to call them before I bought my two groupon coupons, but after we ate there the bill was an additional $35 on top of what I paid online.

My dining companion ordered the Calamari and although it looked good it was a very small serving and she said it was very salty.  The waterfall features in the restaurant were very cool to look at.  As we were about to leave I circled around the cold buffet in the center of the restaurant which was underwhelming to say the least.  In my opinion, Texas de Brazil has a far superior buffet and overall dining experience.  For me, I will not be returning.",

We came for Happy Hour and the first time the bar and outside were so crowded because there was a party or a social or something like that. We couldn't even get in to order anything - it was that crowded. Tonight we went there with a party of about 25 people (for Happy Hour) and we were able to order this time but after an hour of waiting for our food we left without any. Their excuse was that the others ordered salads and other small plates and we ordered crab cakes which takes longer. Really? I think they can't handle bigger parties and become overwhelmed. When we asked for a manager the server first told us there wasn't one there. Then when we voiced our reason for leaving he said he wAs the manager and they were short handed and the reason why it was taking so long. I am giving them the 2 stars because of the service. I really would have liked to try the food but he couldn't tell us when ours would be out so we left.",

That is about enough time to  forget about my last meat hangover and prepare myself  for the next meat hangover.  I always have this dooming feeling that this place is going to shut down, because it was unprofitable due to me and my husband eating atleast 5 lbs of meat, EACH!  Despite being somewhat buffetish, I think the quality remains high and consistent. Frankly, I am very discriminant about what I eat from the \"buffet bar\", while it show freshness, chose wisely, most of it is just filler and distraction from the more expensive meat.  I do eat the beef or salmon carpaccio and sample the soup and hot appetizers... all decent.  However, a little plate of roughage doesn't hurt and can be a welcoming break from the continuous onslaught of hot sizzling meat coming your way.  The meat and variety is awesome especially if you desire red meats.   I notice a few cost saving changes that I think make total sense.  The table side, side dishes are smaller portions but still you can order as many as you want and I am pretty sure if you finish and want more,  they will bring you more.  Shrimp cocktail at the buffet is composed of small shrimps, where as before they were large ones.  Now the large shrimp come tableside, which are brushed with a delicious garlic sauce.  I didn't see much of a raw seafood selection anymore.   Service was \"good\" this time, but in the dozen and half  times I've been here, I've never had less that good service and more often than not it has been excellent and cordial.  P.S.  read the fine print. if you have the recent Groupon offer, be aware it is more like buy one meal at full price get one half off.   If there are two of you, you cannot use two coupons, but you can use two coupon If you have four people.  Just go and enjoy.",

True it helps that my husband knows which meats are the best and which are more just filler meats but the sides and meat were both better than any of the other places. The salad bar was just okay but I never get too excited about that anyway as it is more of a distraction than anything from the real show, THE MEAT.

We had a group of 30 people and every guest felt like they were the only one in the restaurant. The food was outstanding, fresh and presentation was impeccable. Clean plates were provided readily & without prompting, the open bar drinks were delicious...its extremely difficult to pinpoint favorites but several guests raved about the lobster bisque, prime rib, garlic steak, turkey wrapped with bacon, warm garlic & cheese bread, mozzarella served warm & gooey, flank steak....EVERYTHING was wonderful.

Our waiter a very nice young man and kept checking on us. The serving was great, I had the feeling because 90% of our group was Brazilian we had the sort of \"special service\". But even when our cards displayed 'no meat' they still came around. The waiters were nice, and me not having been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before, when I asked what the meat was, they explained. We had a lot of talk with the waiter, because part of our group also came from Holland, and he talked with us and it was all a good time.  I had two glasses of Chardonnay and it was a very good white wine, very soft and fruity.  The meat was amazing, I recommend you try the chicken hearts when you dine there, they are pure heaven. They have a lot of good stuff there, my advice is just try it out! At the salad bar I had gotten some cheese, and what I thought was meat, but it turned out the be cheese as well. It looked a bit red/purple-ish. It tasted like cheese but had a sweet taste to it as well, it was great. This restaurant was simply amazing and a very good fun evening for our party of six!",

I had the lobster bisque soup and prime rib sandwich. The prime rib was fantastic. Given a choice of bread I picked the sourdough which seemed more like a hot dog bun and hence only the four stars. However, we will be back for the happy hour. If the carnivore in you wrestles with your \"health consciousness,\" the light happy hour entrees are a good compromise. I left my reading glasses on the table and a waiter ran out to give them to me as I was leaving. Thanks!",

But we had a certificate so figured we try it out....when calling to make the reservation, the hostess joined us up for their email club, and when she asked for my birthdate and saw my birthday was the week before, told me we would get my meal comped due to it being my birthday month. Or If your a first time customer, you receive 20% of your whole bill.  Food was delicious and their prime rib was the best I or my family, have ever had!!!  And the service, was amazing and rivaled any 5 star restaurant!!!  Definitely give this place a try! You won't be disappointed.",

The salmon, ohhhhh do not pass it up even if you are not a \"fish person\". So good! Oh and the beef flank is yummy. Lots of choices on the salad bar, they will just keep bringing you those sides and that meat- they don't mind if you need a break. Just flip your card over! We were there for over 2.5 hours and never felt rushed even when they got oobber busy! Great wine choices, even for the picky people!!! Go Go GO!!!",

We are from out of town and had heard from local friends that this was a good place to go.  I wasn't too sure because I had this idea that this was a place that was all meat, and I was not disappointed, IT IS!!  I love, love, love vegetables, pastas, salads, and also meat, but this comes when I feel like it.  I looked at their menu online and thought \"it might not be so bad\" after I saw some of their salad bar selection. I made reservations for all of us, and AM I GLAD WE WENT!   I absolutely loved all of their selections.  Some of us picked the salad bar and some had the Via Brazil  Rodizio dinner.  I absolutely loved their sauteed  spinach side, as well as their broccoli, asparagus, and mushrooms.  Did not need to make room for dessert since their fried banana was the BEST EVER I have ever had.  Since it was some of us ladies birthdays we also got some flan and have to admit it was sooo good (as good as mine) and that is saying something for me!  Looking forward to going back and trying the meats next time!!!  Love the staff too!  They were very attentive to us as well as the rest of the tables  and the restaurant was full.  They were on top of everything!  Would definitely recommend Via Brazil!",

Texas de Brasil might be more saltier with their meats compared to this place or you can say this place had less flavioring on their meats. Their salad bar was small, and didn't have much varieties like Texas de Brasil. This place has nice decor and pretty upscale. Overall conclusions: Texas de Brasil is better.",

I really wanted to take my friend and recalled them having an epic salad bar, so I chanced it.   Unbelievable. Not only was there plenty of deliciousness at the salad bar, they were happy to modify side dishes and were extra careful to let me know if anything anyone else ordered had dairy. Brazilians favor olive oil to butter, so this didn't effect my choices too much.   If you're vegetarian or vegan, or have an allergy, this place sure goes the extra mile to accommodate you.   Five stars from how I remember the meat on visits several years ago, and Five stars still, for being helpful and more than that, just all around excellent service.   So, vegan or lion or anywhere in between I definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Went for super bowl . Had a nice time but the waiter was extremely pushy. He insisted we had to have one of the alcohol packages . We only wanted iced tea and my 13 yr old wanted a coke . The waiter literally told us my sons coke would not be refillable unless we had the $48 alcohol wristbands for myself and husband.  Annoyed but we just agreed and went on with our time there . At the end we received the bill with 20% gratuity added in . Waiter didn't mention it of course . I asked on their FB page since when did they add automatic gratuity for 3 people ? I was asked to call Anna and told they do not auto gratuity 3 people . She was so nice  and apologetic . Told me she would speak to GM . Anna called back and said the GM wanted me to come in today at 4pm. I told her I had hurt my foot and it wasn't easy for me to drive but would have my husband take me .  Went at 4pm to Speak to GM (assuming the owner ) . He was extremely defensive , rude , kept saying clearly I didn't want to tip the $55 I had tipped . He kept telling me that the auto gratuity was optional and only suggested . WHAT A LIE ! The bill total included the gratuity . Since when do you have the option to not pay your total bill due ? He then told me he would Speak to the server about the pushy attitude he had but that it was still just a suggested gratuity ?!? So , i asked why he asked me to come there when I live 20 min away when he wasn't trying to make the situation right , only arguing with me . He said I had no reason to come in ?!? This place is an absolute joke ! I only went in as they asked me to .  He said he would give me back whatever part of the tip I wanted . Even proceeded to tell me that the waiter had brought me $55 change while I was at the restaurant ?? The bill was 265.00 .. I gave $280 .. how would he have brought me $55 in change. lol . The waiter never came back with any kind of change . I ended up telling him quite frankly his customer service skills were shocking and I didn't come up there for free with my husband and kids in the car so I would just take my tip back  . Way to earn business . Been there many times with larger parties and will NEVER be back .  Was warned by 2 former employees this guy was horrid but definitely saw that for myself now .  *I was curious about the auto gratuity but My real complaint was only about being told to spend $48x2 people for my son to get refills on his drink . GM turned this into a tip issue and made me look cheap so fine I'll take my tip and give it to someone who wants my business . Thx !",

I suppose my issue is the week before, we went to another Brazilian Restaurant in Summerlin and were blown away by the flavors there...a little (just a little) disappointed.  Here's my take on the place. 1. Really good salad bar. nice assortment. Would have liked to see more fruit on the line as it's a good pallet cleanser when you are switching from one cut of meat to another. 2. Our waiter was awesome. Polite and attentive. 3. We opted to get the Sterling Meal (more cuts of meat) - They tout 21. We didn't count, but it seemed to be the same 12 or so in the hour that we dined. This seems to be an overstatement. (3 stars...a-ok, right? - not a big complaint.) 4. Great wine menu. 5. The meats were bland. They do provide sauces - but a Brazilian steakhouse is supposed to be well seasoned. 6. Service will poorly timed. It's like a gaucho fire-drill at times. Way too fast with them almost lining up to serve each guest.  Again, this place is A-OK. Unfortunately, when you have a restaurant in a town where there are so many choices, you have to be more than just A-OK.",

All orders were delivered perfectly. We did checks per couples with one single. All checks were prepared perfectly and in a timely manner. The food was outstanding, service was awesome. Thank you George!!!",

However, my experience was sub par. The service was abysmal, and it took 30 minutes before we received any meat or appetizers. The meat was pretty good, but for the price could be better. After dinner we ordered dessert, which took another 30 minutes to bring out even though all we ordered was ice cream and pineapples.  In summary, Fogo De Chao highly imitated never duplicated.",

    "text": "What a huge Disappointment!!! From the start the service was horrible ... Had a reservation for 2:30 and showed up 45 minutes early and went to the bar !! The bartender was overwhelmed and we waited 15 minutes before I went to the bar and then was ignored for about 10 minutes !   During this time my wife had gone to the hostess and mentioned how long it is taking to get service and the hostess had the nerve to say you are upset over a drink ?? My wife said well yeah... We have a reservation and its Mothers Day  and we are sitting in the bar !! She then asked to speak to the manager and I watched the hostess approach the manager and tell him that a lady was complaining about the service in the bar .... Now let me paint a picture of what was going on in the bar at this time ! There were a total of 5 people sitting in the bar including the three of us and none of us were being waited on . It was the change between Brunch and dinner and there were three people behind the bar !! The manager , bartender and a young lady punching stuff in the computer !! At the drink station where the servers would pick up had 6 people waiting for their drinks for their tables !!   Now back to the manager !! He completely ignored the situation for about ten minutes literally walking past us and in circles for about another two minutes until he finally asked if we are ok ?? At this time we decided we would leave and gave the feedback that they were clearly not staffed for Mother's Day and he had no idea what he was doing and the staff was very rude !! We will not be going back and Texas De Brazil will have our Business forever !!   Completely frustrating and upset !!",

    "text": "Amazing, simply amazing!  Worth the price and the drive.  The salad bar is filled with great selections, and the meat is prepared to perfection, no matter how well done you desire it.  Service was very attentive, and came to the table frequently.  A great place to go for a quality meal to celebrate, or take a date, or even just have a nice personal dinner.    So tonight I was looking at Brazilian Steakhouses on Yelp, and another reviewer mentioned this place.  I live on the other side of the valley, so I was a little hesitant to make the 30 minute drive when I have a couple of places on my side of town.  Well as soon as I took my first bites, I knew it was worth the drive.  The salad bar had a few different dishes in addition to the standard Brazilian Steakhouse fare.  That being said, after a quick trip around it, I didn't grab much, after all, I'm here for the meats.    As soon as I sat down from the salad bar trip, I was greeted by the gauchos who brought me several kinds of steak, pork shoulder, and turkey wrapped in bacon.  While I like my meat more on the well done side, there were cuts for every preference.  Once I made it known to the gauchos that I liked the meat more well done, every time they approached my table they offered me the well done portions.    My server was constantly present refilling my beverage and asking if he could get me side dishes,  Unlike the other places I've visited, here you have to request your sides, but they're included in the price.  They have several options and of course they're all unlimited.    As it said on their menu there are a couple of things you have to ask for, if you would like to have them, including chicken hearts.  From the first trip I took to a Brazilian Steakhouse, I learned to like the chicken hearts, so I made sure to request them.  When they came, they were plentiful and flavorful.    The only suggestion I have is for them to leave a menu or list of the meats so you know which ones are upcoming, and when to not fill up.    The atmosphere was great, the gauchos and servers were very attentive, and most importantly the food was flavorful and delicious.  Well worth the cost, and the drive from anywhere in the Vegas Valley.    With the prices and the drive it is unlikely this is a weekly destination, but I'll definitely be back for special occasions.  It's also a great place to come when you just feel like celebrating a Wednesday night off (or whatever night you feel.)",

Very slow and forgetful server;  busser continually prompted to remove dishes and replenish water.  Everyone selected the $50 menu.  Salad bar not what it used to be.  Luke warm and bland lobster bisque, cheese selection limited, Brazilian rice and beans also only luke warm.  Mussels, clams and chicken were hot and very good.  Servers are trained to offer chicken and pork products REPEATEDLY  before bringing top sirloin, flank steak and tough tri-tip.  Small shrimp were also offered.  Side dishes were served three times before WE had to ask for other items which are included on the Sterling menu.    Clever:  fill 'em up with the cheap stuff so they are too full to consume the expensive meats.  Not so clever at all.  Which featured menu items were never voluntarily offered and did we have to ask for?   lamb chops, prime rib, ribeye steak, salmon.  One serving of each meat received, never a morsel of the salmon.  The value just isn't there; no ambiance/music; manager and assistant managers walked around slowly in circles, never once stopping at our table to test our satisfaction.    Be advised:  choose Texas de Brazil over via Brazil.",

Our waitress was just on it, our drinks were never empty, the menu was explained to us and I was ready to go.  There are a few different meals options which correlate to the types of meat you're offered, and we decided to go with the top option that had everything on it.  The price was $49.99 per person, but that included a list of about 15 different meet options, and the salad bar.  The salad bar was so impressive that I would be perfectly content with eating just off of that, ya know if we weren't at a steakhouse!  It had cream cheese jalapenos, various meat platters, etc.  I would definitely go again!!",

The salad bar is fairly small, but all of the items on offer were fresh and tasty. Unlimited sides were a nice touch, although they were out of yucca fries by 6pm, so we didn't get any :-(.  We paid for the upgrade so that we could sample all of the meat. I think we only counted 7 or 8 different meats, and the shrimp and ribs only came out once, so not sure if it is worth the upcharge or not.  My only complaint is that they had a wedding reception going on when we were there, and the music was extremely loud. Loud enough that it fought with the dining room music, and sort of put a damper on our ability to have conversation.   Despite the minor inconvenience, we will be back.",

There are tons of meat and salad bar options, which is great for picky eaters and those with dietary restrictions. However, if you are going to come here, you definitely have to love MEAT!  My favorite dishes were the white clams (available at the salad bar), the top sirloin (melt in your mouth delicious!), sauteed bananas (almost like a fruit creme brulee) and shrimp. I tried so many different types of meats--chicken, different cuts of beef, lamb...it was carnivore heaven.  The cocktails were a highlight of my meal as well...the caipirinhas are strong but delicious! I want to try their house infused cocktails next time.",

Their specialty is the picanha (or House Sirloin). Its tender slices will melt-in-your-mouth. Another personal favorite is the tangy chicken.   I've never seen a salad bar that has fresh lobster bisque or watermelon topped with diced jicama. The little bites of Brazilian bread are delectable dipped in the bisque!   Try the caipirinha--a Brazilian cocktail--but sip it slowly as it's nearly straight alcohol. The light refreshing taste can fool you!   Sunday Brunch features a good selection of their most popular meats, along with a \"made-to-order\" omelette and waffle bar and the gourmet salad bar. The mimosas delightfully round out the brunch.   For tourists, Via Brasil is worth the cab trip off of the Strip to see what else Vegas has to offer. For locals, it's a slice of heaven!",

They seemed to focus on sending the cheap meats around more that the expensive cuts like filet, lamb, or the fish. We mostly got shot rib, chicken, or flank steak. But I do like flank. Our waiter charged us for a 2 year old, then told us he thought he was 5. Wow, kid barely talks and sits in a high chair, and our server thinks he's ready for kindergarten. He also charged us for 5 people when there were only 4. So charge for a toddler that was suppose to be free and charge for another person that wasn't there. The food we did get was good, but I probably won't be back, because even after we called the restaurant to tell them about the server (and we told them the food was fantastic) they gave us a quick, insincere apology and denied a compensation to return to make up for the bad experience.",

It was not nearly as busy as last time so I kind of get the feeling that holidays and special occasions are not the best times to visit. Had Gerardo as a server again ( see previous review) and again he was great. Went above and beyond to get a dish to us that was not being offered on the salad bar but had it specially prepared. Meat selection seemed to be much more than before. This visit we had the choice of sides which I liked much better.   So overall I either came on a bad night the first time, or special occasion nights are too much for them to handle. I still prefer Texas de Brazil given the choice. That being said I had a much more enjoyable meal this time around and very much appreciate them reaching out to me and recognizing a bad customer experience and making it right.",

All of the different proteins that they served us were very good. This place has a salad bar that tops almost every salad bar I've had. The Chocolate Mousse was very good, and so was my Cappuccino. So, if you're in Vegas, try this place and you won't regret it.",

One of the managers told us about their brunch which I will be back to try! Seriously if you enjoy being pampered and catered to while dining this is the restaurant for you. Make sure you try the lamb my husband is still raving about it!!",

Twenty minutes later we are offered a table in the same area and were informed that the staff was not aware of our previous problems with the seating area. Their only potential solution was seating us alone in a completely empty and service-less section. Our evening was ruined, and we we had to leave the restaurant as there were no other options available. The customer service was not up to par and the overall treatment and respect for the reservation was absent. We were the only people waiting and felt uncomfortable watching other people eat. Very disappointing. We'll never come back.",

We were one of only a handful of tables.  The ambiance is pretty, spacious, even bordering on elegant.  The salad bar has a few standout items (beef carpacio, Greek salad, mushrooms)  But most wasn't.  I liked that there are a selection of items that are brought to the table upon request.  But again, what we tried was lacking.  The spinach as undercooked, the asparagus overcooked.  The cheese bread was too big and rather heard.  The bananas were under ripe and bitter.  The demi-glaze wasn't reduced enough and the mint jelly was overly gelatinzed.  We ordered the Sterling menu and there are supposed to be 21 meats.  We were there for almost 2 hours and only saw 11 meats.  The rib eye and shrimp were probably the only two stand outs.  Both flavorful and well cooked.  But the lamb chops were gristly, the leg of lamb was too gamy and we are huge lamb fans.  The salmon came with a wonderful sauce but was so overcooked.  But worst was that the servers were few and far between.  Even getting a refill of water was hard.     We eat at rodizios at least twice a month and I have never left one hungry, till here.",

The service at Via Brasil is amazing. We have had servers who talk to us about band shirts that we've worn. We've had servers who pay such great attention to us that we don't have to ask for anything- it's already been served! The salad bar is fricken crazy. Are you serious! The lobster bisque is probably one of the best I've ever tried. Although, I've only tried it from a few places. The meat? Holy smokes. It's so tasty. The juiciness. The tenderness. The flavor. The selection. I want to bathe in it. Texas De Brazil, has a close menu but when I've been there I've only been offered 4-5 different meats and had to request the rest. Via Brasil though? It's on my table before I can even think to ask for it. Which you CAN request certain meats and temperatures. My heathen mother always requests \"well-done\". Crazy, I know. But let's talk about the mashed potatoes that they serve you... Be prepared to need one dish each person. Slap my mama, it's delicious. Everything. Every single thing. About Via Brasil screams class and excellence. There is no doubt in my mind that this place is 5 stars. No, 20 stars. I would eat here constantly if I weren't broke as a joke. I love Via Brasil. The entertainment is cool too but, the meat! The sides! The salads! The hospitality! The owner! Everything about Via Brasil is superior to the other Brazilian steakhouses that I've been to. I love Via Brasil. I recommend it to everybody. I want to go there now. See you soon, Via, Baby.",

I ordered the \"sterling\" menu while the other members of my party ordered the \"prime\" menu.  I don't know if most people don't order off of the sterling menu, but I had to wait 15 minutes for my first selection while the rest of my party was served.  Then I had to wait quite a while for every other selection that I ordered.  It seemed like they were cooking it to order.  Regarding the bacon wrapped filet - the bacon was completely raw.  The server said that he had medium well and medium filets on his skewer.  I ordered the medium well which at best medium rare.  There shouldn't be blood all over your plate after eating a medium well steak.  How does a steak house not be able to cook a steak properly? I tried one bite, but couldn't eat anymore. Head to wait at least 15 minutes for our check - then when he finally brought it back my credit card was missing.  Then when I got home noticed that he charged us too much. He charged us for two Sterling dinners and we only had one. Wow!  Definitely not worth anywhere near the price.  Will not go back!",

For around $56 a person, we got the All You Can Eat salad/seafood bar, all you can eat meats brought to you (tri tip, sirloin, filet, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, pork) side dishes (mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, garlic bread, corn on the cob) and dessert.  The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. The servers come around consistently with different meats on a stick and accouterments and my plate was never empty. Who likes meat on a stick? This girl.  The only complaint I have is that they garnish everything at the salad bar with green onions. Every single dish, including the lobster bisque, is sprinkled with nasty green onions. Not everyone cares for the taste of raw onions, so maybe just put them on the side for people who want them? Garnishing dishes with green onions is lazy and unimaginative. Just sayin'.",

    "text": "Our friend who has been to the brunches at Via Brasil and enjoyed them suggested their advertised Happy Hours on Wednesdays and Thursdays.  They are supposed to be on the patio, but due to the heat and the fact they do not have misters, it was honored in the bar.  The bar area is very tight and in a short time, became very crowded.  We then discovered a Meet Up group was meeting there.  Eventually they did move the majority to the patio, in the brutal heat.  Our server became overwhelmed pretty quickly as it became apparent he was handling the patio.  I needed to ask about how an item had been prepared and it took awhile before he came back with an answer.  As time passed, our server no longer appeared.  We wanted to order more drinks and another appetizer.  We saw him coming in from the patio and waiting at the bar for the drinks he had to serve out there, a few times, and tried to catch his eye.  After 30 minutes, we gave up and decided just to just leave but we didn't even have our bill.  So after discussion, because we are honest people, we tried to figure out what we owed and left cash.  But one friend so other people moving to the table and was concerned about the cash.  And magically, the server appeared!  She told him we figured it out best we can.  I stopped at the hostess station and expressed our dissatisfaction but the young woman was slow in understanding our concerns and finally asked if we wanted to talk to the manager.  At that point, we just wanted to leave.  There were two issues: they shouldn't be hosting a Meet Up without enough room and servers and if they choose to do that, then the manager needs to swing through the bar occasionally and ensure that patrons are taken care of.  The server may have been new or not properly trained.  A good server would have made sure his other customers had been taken care of by someone else, if he couldn't.  Very disappointing experience and have no plans to go back or recommend.",

Caipirhina - Via wins for smoothness of this classic drink from Brazil. Cheese bread - Fogo gets the nod for lighter and fluffier dough. Meat - tie. You will prefer some cuts at one locale over another but it's a wash in the end Side dishes - Fogo wins here. Via has no fried polenta and their fried bananas pale in comparison to the maduros at Fogo. Desserts - too full, couldn't eat any at Via.  Bottom line: Fogo is still the standard but you will not be disappointed by Via and I wouldn't hesitate to go to Via again. Luv that Brazilian churrascaria.",

Place wasn't overly crowded which was nice. Our oldest was given a fuzzy coloring board which was really cool. Our baby was given a light up bracelet which he really enjoyed.   Their buttons are small- colored red and dark blue. They should really change those colors. We were passed over many times (we were sat in a corner). The salad bar was skim pickin when I went up but they did have muscles and clams which I enjoyed.   The food was just \"eh\" as I didn't find myself wanting or needing more of well anything. Out of the norm for a Brazilian steak house! The meat didn't really stand out for me and that was disappointing for the price. They do have seafood additions but we only had shrimp pass us accompanied with the steak and the clams/muscles I mentioned previously.  Having refills on my sofa was nice compared to previous places. Their bread is delicious and stays warm.  I don't think my family would be back though based on the main course not wowing us. It's just a waste of hard earned money in our opinion.",

    "text": "I had a friend come over and he walked in the door to exclaim \"I am SO HUNGRY, I could eat a cow!\" Suddenly I knew exactly where we were going! Via Brasil. I had really wanted to try this place, especially since I can literally walk here from my house!  We walked in, with out reservation. Although the dining room was pretty full they seated us right away. Right off the bat, the service was awesome! Start to finish, I have to say this may be some of the best service I have had in Las Vegas! We felt SO taken care of every minute!  The style of restaurant is a Brazilian steak house, where they carve endless delicious meat at your table. Much like the other 2 chain restaurants in the city, except this one is locally owned and run...If that kind of thing matters to you. Personally, any time I can support a local business I am all over it!  The dinner menu consists of two choices. Regular menu which is AYCE for $34.95 and the Deluxe Menu that is AYCE $49.95. The difference is the deluxe menu has premium cuts of meat, and seafood. We decided to go with the deluxe menu, and I am not sure I really knew which was which to be honest, everything was really good! I guess maybe if we had done the regular premium meat would have whisked on by?   It was all really great! Mountains of meat, a few beverages and somehow managed to save room to split a dessert! The check total was $180 for the both, including tip and everything. Not a cheap night out, but for the right night, or a special occasion it was fantastic!",

The bar server Victor offered us to try the different selections of meat they had to offer in the dinning room. We were not disappointed. I can't praise our server Ricardo enough for the excellent recommendations. The beef ribs were so tender and juicy, by far the best meat. The ribeye and salmon were extremely good as well. 5 Stars !

I had an ODORLESS black dye on my hair (no bleach) that needed an hour to process and I was hungry, so tried to kill 2 birds with one stone. I sat at the bar cause it was more causal but apparently my hair dye was offensive as the owner exiled us to the back of the restaurant behind a fountain next to the sliding doors that had a crack with all the cold air coming in. We were freezing and humiliated. I went and apologized to the other people at the bar for bothering them assuming someone complained, but they said they didn't notice or care that I had dye in my hair. So, it was definitely the call of the venue alone. Rude! At least the bartender was nice about it. She was so embarrassed for us and trying to make up for  it she made me a free drink!",

The salad bar was amazing and it had lobster bisque! Which I'm a big fan of only if it's made correctly and this place makes it correctly! The meat was just non stop. Before we could finish one, the next one came along. Rack of lamb, lamb chops, filet Mignons, prime rib, chicken, shrimps, the list just goes on and on. But all the food was so delicious, tender and moist! And to top it all off, the customer service was superb! And to end the dinner, the staff came out with a birthday caramel flan with a big sparkler just for my husbands birthday. Thank you everyone so much!",

First of all the service here is phenomenal. The servers are super attentive and friendly. They made constant checks to see if their was anything we needed.  The food is also amazing too! We shared the Caesar salad, beef carpaccio and one of the steak dishes. Each was very flavorful and just the right portion size. You also can't beat the HH pricing. The total for all that food as well as three drinks was about $40 with tip. You can't go wrong there.  I will most certainly be coming back here again and again. Love it!",

My fave steak is the Garlic Pichana...so tasty! And my fave side dish is the banana brought in a hot skillet with cinnamon, my kids loved it!

The beef carpaccio was good and the goat cheese jalapenos were nice. They had some nice cheeses but the salad bar was generally underwhelming.  We ordered the Sterling option which had 21 different meats and I don't even think we tried 15 of them. The leg of lamb had mint in it which was gross, lamb chops were dry, the other meats we did try were just ok, not overwhelmingly delicious to anything.   Our server Gerardo was more focused on socializing and finishing up his closing duties. We waited what seemed like forever for different meats, we kept getting the same selections over and over, our sides took forever and when we ordered sauces for our meats they took a while and one of them came out in a styrofoam container.. really??? They couldn't find one clean ramekin to bring us our sauce in? That's ridiculous..and our server kept going over to another table and just chatting, i believe he knew then because the manager was over there for quite some time , and other food runners kept having to ask him what we needed.. I don't understand why he couldn't just get us what we needed..   Cappuccino was great, coffee was great, Very strong, according to my friend. Desserts were the best part of the meal although I thought the flan tasted weird..",

That's because I never seem to get my money's worth. But if I could, I would eat at a place like this on the daily.  If you haven't been to a Churrascaria before, then you're missing out on an all-you-can-eat meat treat.  Carnivores are welcome.    There's three options when dining here; the Sterling Dinner (21 meat options), Prime Dinner (14 meat options), or Rodizo Brunch.  The salad bar also includes soups, cheese, bread, and pastas.  The salad bar is part of the meal, but don't recommend spending your calories here.  Save yourself for the meat.  Servers will be by every couple of minutes with different types of meat as long as you have the puck with the green side up.  I tend to have a strategy when I dine at places like this. I will usually get a very small sample of each meat.  Once I find my favorite, it's on like Donkey Kong.  I will go after my favorites and at Via Brasil, those favorites include the garlic steak, tri-tip, tangy chicken, turkey, and sausage.  The restaurant will also prepare the meat the way you like it.  I didn't have any complaints with the meats that I had. Everything that I had was good.  As for the service, it's close to \"as good as it gets\".  Overall, I recommend Via Brasil.  Feastmode On!!",

Than sat us by the kitchen and where they and bringing and putting drinks my boyfriend nearly almost got drinks spilled on him. I asked our host if she could sit us somewhere else and in the rudest way said that she would have to put us back on the list after we had already been waiting 45 minutes didn't even say she would try. We called the manager and a sweet heart he moved us no problem. The food was incredible and amazing. Our waitress was really nice in the beginning and towards the end made us feel we had to rush out of there. I definitely won't be returning and for $180 not worth the service.",

I started with the salad bar which was a mistake, should've skipped it and went straight for the main course! My favorite meats were the garlic steak, prime rib, and short rib. Unlike most Brazilian steakhouse, the sides here rock, and they're brought fresh to the table. I honestly enjoyed everything I tried except the lamb (seemed a bit overcooked) and whatever we wanted, they were happy to bring! In addition to the stuff found at normal Brazilian restaurants, they also have grilled shrimp, chicken hearts, and clams (on the buffet). We, against all odds, also ordered dessert, and everything we had was delicious. I strongly recommend the tres leches cake. You can't go wrong with this place and you won't leave hungry!",

I get a bowl of the Brazilian salsa vinaigrette to dip everything in.      The service is top notch. The meats come around every 30 seconds or so. The waiters and managers are all very nice and helpful.    They have a beautiful dessert bar that I've always been to full to try out. The bar is exquisite as well with a giant waterfall and a two story glass wine room. The outdoor patio is very nice too. If heaven is like this place I might kill myself tomorrow!!!",

One of our first experiences there was during the soccer World Cup in 2014.  The place is so freaking popular that it was packed, lucky for us we had our reservation  It's not my first time there , so it's tough to impressive me but with such packed place the serving team was on top of their game. If there was an Olympic sport \"running with the meat skewers around people \" these guys would take gold! Of course caipirinhas helped the celebration mood Anyway as an experienced fan of Brazilian food, soccer and culture I recommend this place hands down!",

You walk into a restaurant that appears fancy but it is a casual place. It was well lit but not overpoweringly lit. They sat us quickly as we had a reservation for 6 people. The waitress was kind and patient explaining how the purchasing option works and how the meat/food would be brought out. She helped us pick drinks and genuinely made us feel comfortable.   Oh boy once the food started coming, it came! The servers slicing up the meat seem to come in groups moving from table to table presenting and explained what they had on their skewers. Others would have carts with fish, ribs, and other meats. Once we were stuffed we ordered desserts and we were not disappointed at all! We got the baked coconut which is a coconut cake with vanilla /coconut ice cream ontop. We also go tres leches chocolate cake.   I highly recommend the picanah and the sweet onion chicken. Everything is good but these are my favs.",

I asked for the check and it took 15 mins just for him to bring it to me. Also, it took 10 mins just to get my water. I will say because it was on Valentine day, but who knows why it was so slow.

Had no ice, took forever for them to fix it, I could tell they were annoyed. But all we wanted was a little ice with normal tasting coke.. Not sure if they only had a fountain machine but clearly It needed to be refilled or fixed. So anyways I drank hot watered down coke with my meal haha. Because after a while its just not worth it to keep bothering them so they can just spit in your drink lol Everything felt rushed we were there towards the end of closing but not super cutting it, they were trying to rush us to leave honestly. We were the last ones there, anyways I go pick up my brother down the street. when I come back they cleared all my plates that still had food, my mom said they insisted. Not cool I spent $80 for the all you can eat meat, the salad bar, one drink and ONE dessert. That's $80 LOL the dessert they brought was small as fuck.. SO overpriced. Biggest waste of money ever! I probably wont be back.",

The place was so festive with the music, dancers, acrobatics, and tall lady. Great entertainment! It was such a lively atmosphere that it definitely added to our Vegas celebrations. The food was delicious as well and the host was very accommodating to our no beef/no pork requests. It took a couple turns before the waiters got it. They brought out meats that we requested and grilled vegetables in a timely manner. The host was very polite that everything was wonderful. Only meat we didn't like was the salmon. We had two vegetarians in our group who also enjoyed their salad bar. I even dropped the birthday cake in advance and they stored it for me and brought it out lit (except they forgot to light the candles!). Thank you for making our dinner wonderful for the whole group. We would love to come back again next time we are in Vegas!!",

The food was so yummy.  The salad bar wasn't your typical lettus and dressing either.  They had pasta, roasted veggies and other different dishes.  The meat was a little plain, but the chutney they provided to put on it made up for it completely.  My husband and I tried the rack of lamb, beef wrapped in bacon, turkey breast wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, and the beef ribs.  The only thing we didn't like was the lamb, but then again neither of us really lamb to begin with.  My husband also tried the salmon and he loved it.  The service was also great.  Our server took his time to explain how everything worked and checked in frequently.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be back for sure!",

In addition, I am an event planner (20+ yrs.) in which I have produced, managed and coordinated dinners, recepitons, high teas and major events (i.e. Kentucky Derby, PGA's, etc., from large scale too small; International dignitaries to communities.  This establishment went above and beyond my expectations of any venue or restaurant I've worked with.  The food was absolutely fabulous! (catering to all my guests special requests in attendance).  The manager Sidney was the epitome of class, grace and hospitality.  I strive for perfection and he provided me with just that.  From my wine tasting two days before to the service of my wedding cake and grooms cake, all of my guests couldn't have been more impressed and many of them come from the Hospitality world.  Every one of my guests who came in from Los Angeles, San Diego, Nashville and Chicago all want a Via Brasil in there town.  I understand that plans are in the works for one to be up on the Las Vegas Strip soon.  If any of you have been to a Brazilian Steakhouse before (we have a few in Chicago) and you're in Las Vegas, please go for one of the most palatable meals of your life. Special note:  Their salad/appetizer buffet is to die for with salmon in a passion fruit sauce,  asparagus risotto to lobster bisque...OMG! It's a meal in itself.  My friends in California are planning a weekend there for their friends because as i was told.  That was the best wedding food they've ever had in their life!  Believe it when you taste it.  Make sure you eat lite the day before you go...  Kudos to Via Brasil and many thanks to Sidney and his staff.",

I've been to approx 5 different churrascaria restaurants in 3 different cities, but this is by far the best. I love everything here, especially lamb, garlic sirloin, fish (salmon), fried banana, risotto, and caramel flan. This place does train their service stuff well. You may feel that someone is always watching you when you eat, but as soon as you finish eating, drop a fork, or empty the water glass, someone always come right away to accommodate your need. I asked the server if he's got any lamb, and even though there was only 4 of us in the restaurants that time, he went back to the kitchen and prepare one just for us. Managers are also very friendly. Ambience here is sophisticated... subtle Brazilian music, spacious floor plans, contemporary objects, perfect for someone's birthday party or dinner date. I'd love to come back soon, but first I have to digest the food first.",

The garlic steak was also another one i liked. There's also a salad bar. It was clean and FRESH. A good variety to chose from. The cold pasta was so delicious, i wished i can take some home with me! haha. If you can handle the dessert after dinner, go for it! From what i remembered, there were cheese cake, flan, pudding.

However, the salad bar was lacking in everyway it lacked 90% of what texas de brasil had. period. It sucked to the 10th degree. Whats the deal with ordering the side dishes separately, why not just place it in the salad bar. Its management trying to control cost i believe or trying to make you feel your getting more than usual than other places. Lastly the WAITER was nice but the way they present the way you should eat was shocking. Here is what the head waiter said. i will paraphrase \" go ahead and eat the salad bar first and when you done i will bring another plate so you can start eating meat\" REALLY SERIOUSly ???U never want to say fill yourself with you pathetic salad bar and when your almost full then you can eat meat. WE WERE AMAZED AT THAT REMARK. I guess it came from management because you never say that to a customer. you should just simply say enjoy the salad bar and start eating all the meat you want. This place is a bit pretentious they should just keep it real and not try to be something better than \"the other guys\" because it was not.",

The atmosphere and food is impressive and they've got 5 stars so far until I get the bill. They charged extra for desserts and drinks which it was assumed came with the buffet. $7 per dessert and about $3 per drink which made the bill about $30 more than expected. Those hidden costs were pretty underhanded because they even brought the dessert cart to the table and asked what we wanted for dessert. It would be just as unfair as finding out that the various poultry meats offered contained an extra charge.There were no menus and nobody told us drinks and desserts wouldn't be included in the buffet.

    "text": "I am extremely upset that I had such a negative experience at this restaurant.   I will start by saying that the two stars is simply for the food. They have really good food that is really authentic and homestyle Brazilian food which is hard to find in Las Vegas.   We went to this restaurant a few times in the past few months and have not had the best service which is really a shame. We asked for a table for three. The restaurant was completely empty and had 3 tables seated. The hostess asked us to wait by the door for a few minutes to \"see if they had anything available.\" We were a bit taken back since the entire place was empty, but patiently waited. About 15 minutes went by and the hostess just stood there staring out into space and wouldn't sit us for some reason.   It was so frustrating that it seemed like they did not want our business. Being that we were so hungry we decided to just leave and drive 30 minutes to Texas de Brazil at Town Square. Totally worth it because they were super happy to help us and their service was phenomenal.   I promised myself I wouldn't come back to this restaurant because I think customer service is the most important thing for me and this restaurant clearly needs to focus a little less time staring in to space and more time focussing on employee development and training.",

Our only complaint is the coffee.  It tasted like instant.  Extremely strong and as soon as It started to cool down it was sooooo bitter.  I understand most people are not ordering coffee so why not have one of those single cup machines.  The only other thing was they had fried rice to go with black beans.  A nice white rice would have been so much better.  Our server was Vinny and he was amazing.  He was very attentive and took his time with us. We have been to another Brazilian steakhouse on the strip and Via Brazil kicked their butt with the food and service.  We will most definitely be back!",

The brunch is phenomenal. With $17 all you can drink mimosas, bellinis, strawberry kir royales, mango champagne, white wine spritzers, and sangria. You cannot get a better deal. $6.50 is not a bad deal either, but you might as well go all in and enjoy yourself.   The meat selection consisted of 9-10 different cuts of different animals. The picanha, garlic sirloin, prime rib, and pineapple were the group favorites. If the rodizio attendants don't come around regularly enough, you can ask the waiter to send them over.  The salad bar was where I found them to be weaker. I wish I could say that something stood out, but it was all relatively standard. The omelet and waffle bar does make up for it though. They do need a secondary waffle iron, because it was backed up for a majority of the time.",

    "text": "If I could do no stars, I would because we didn't even get a chance to eat here tonight.   It's Valentine's day...I get that but if you take a reservation and call it a reservation, you should be in a position of managing your restaurant in such a way that your customers' tables are ready and available for them at the reserved time.  Especially if that time is a 9 pm reservation because according to Open Table at the time the \"reservation\" was made, it was the earliest time available for a party of 2. AND especially since Via Brasil called me to confirm the reservation yesterday afternoon.   Upon arriving (15 min early, I might add) we discovered several other seemingly disgruntled couples standing outside of the restaurant. We walked in to check in for our 9 pm \"reservation\" and were told that \"unfortunately\" they were running behind and were only just seating people with 8 pm reservations meaning that our 9 pm reservation would actually be sat closer to 10 pm.   So, the reservation wasn't really a reservation...it was call ahead seating booked through Open Table? For Valentine's dinner?  Riiiight.   So, thank you Via Brasil...you actually did us a huge favor. Rather than waiting until nearly 10 pm to eat in your obnoxiously loud and crowded restaurant, we went across the street to Honey Salt and were sat right away.  We had an amazing meal for probably half the cost of what we would have paid at your restaurant. Funny thing about Honey Salt...they recognized the couples eat out at a nice restaurant for Valentine's Day and actually brought in extra tables to accommodate more patrons...GENIUS! Bonus points...they handed out roses to the ladies. Honey Salt is our new fave joint near our house. Separate 5 star review coming shortly for them...",

I could not have been more disappointed. I made a reservation for 9 pm- arrived at 8:45 only to be waiting in a chaotic line for 30 minutes just to check in. Once I got to the front, the hostess informed me it would be (at least) an additional 45 minutes. I'm sorry, what is the point of a reservation if I will be seated OVER AN HOUR past my reservation time? I understand restaurants run behind at time, I've been in Food & Beverage for 9 years now and have experienced it all, but that amount of time is unacceptable. Ended up ruining the plans for our entire night. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",

Not too fancy, not too casual. The service is good. Not outstanding, but good.  I was here for brunch. Again, the prices are fab. Less than $25 for AYCE salad bar, meats, omelettes, benedicts, and waffles. And then an additional $15 for all you can drink bloody marys, mimosas, bellinis, etc. Needless to say, I filled up fast.  The salad bar is on the small side, but I liked that they also had hot offerings, incluidng a lobster bisque soup, steamed clams, and rigatoni alla vodka. The vodka sauce was quite delicious.  For the meats, there were numerous offerings. A couple were really good. Others were just ok. And others were eh, I'll just leave the rest of it sitting here on the my plate. Unlike some of the competitors, Via Brasil has warm pineapple, ham, chicken, turkey, etc. But the red meat is truly what it's all about - and it's what tastes the best IMHO.  If you somehow still manage to have room after all that food, there is also a dessert cart where you can select from an array of desserts, I had the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself was fine, but the berries were a bit too tart for my liking (and I love tart and sour things too). I'm not sure there's really a point to getting dessert here.  In the end, I'm still a bigger fan of a competitor place. But I can definitely see myself coming here again for brunch.",

We were there on business in Las Vegas, and didn't want to do the usual \"On the Strip\" experience.. It's located in a nice, seemingly newly developed area with a parking lot with plenty of parking.  Highlights: + Very wide selection of meats and seafood + Customer service was spot on, and they keep the food coming! + Was close to the Strip (about 15-20 minutes)  Final Thoughts: I'm \"jelly\" of the people that live closer to this place. Would be great to have something as fairly priced and with the nice environment out where we live. The food was awesome, customer service was great, and if you love to eat A LOT of food this place has it all.. meats, seafood, buffet, and salad bar.",

    "text": "Awesome food, terrific service, super manager, fair price = 5 stars!  Have always wanted to try Via Brasil Steakhouse, since it is so close to home, and with the Groupon promotion it was a no brainer.  Their self-serve salad bar is excellent.  The variety of food and the taste was outstanding, even though it is not the main reason for visiting Via Brasil, it was a nice treat and helps break up the all-meat-fest.  I enjoyed almost all the BBQ meats that was served by the waiter. But I really like the sausage, the lamb, chicken hearts (not on the menu, but you can ask for it, as it is one of the things served in this kind of restaurant in Brazil). I didn't care for the baked salmon, even though the passion fruit sauce that was served with it was good).  But you should definitely pace yourself and try everything and find out what you like and ask for more if you still have room in your tummy.  The servers were all very friendly as they make their round with whatever they bring out from the kitchen and identifying what it is so you don't have to guess.   If you have room for dessert after your meal, they have a dessert cart to help visually entice you for some after meal sweets.  I tried their Coconut Flan, and thought it was good.  I liked the creamy richness and the coconut flavor.  As a nice restaurant in Summerlin, they probably should have more customers, but when I went they weren't too busy.  So making a same day reservation just hours ahead was not an issue for me.  I spoke to the manager and he told me they were getting more business with the Groupon promotion (and they just recently ran another Groupon offer) so the strategy is working.  Anyway, because of the awesome service from the waiter to the manger, and the good food I will definitely be back.  And having more Groupon to use will keep my tummy and wallet on my future visits.   Decor: 5/5  The self-serve salad bar was nicely decorated and kept clean.  The restaurant was sophisticatedly (is that a word?) decorated. Food: 4/5  Overall I am very pleased with it.   Service:  5/5  Servers were friendly.  The manager that made the rounds and speaking to the guests was genuinely friendly. Location:  Great for locals living in the SW, but will be too far of a trip if coming from the Strip via a cab. Price: 4/5  Definitely take advantage of Groupon or other offers when available. Ambiance: 5/5  Very classy and upscale, yet very relaxing as well.",

    "text": "I had my wedding here 9/26/15 and simply could not have been more satisfied with the entire experience. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone. Anna Gomes, the Event Manager, is truly a dream to work with. Weddings are hard anyway, and it was even more complicated that I was planning from Chicago. But Anna was always very prompt and patient in responding to my barrage of emails.   When I was heading to Vegas for my bachelorette party a few months before my wedding, she made time to personally meet with me and give me a tour of the restaurant. I took a huge leap of faith and booked this place without seeing it. From the pictures on Yelp and Facebook, I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting myself into, but there was always a nagging fear in the back of my mind that I had fallen for good advertising. Especially because the price was so cheap, I was worried that the restaurant would be cheap looking. Well, when I finally saw the venue, I was BLOWN AWAY by how beautiful it was. The pictures absolutely do no do it justice. The place is very elegant inside. I especially love the giant waterfall!   The day of, everything was set up exactly how I had requested it, down to the color of the lights. Anything I asked for was immediately put into place. For example, I asked the guestbook table to be moved three different times (small bridezilla moment, I guess) and it was done immediately and without complaint each time. During the meal, my father mentioned to Anna that my sisters hadn't gotten the chance to try to filet mignon yet, so Anna personally went to the kitchen to find the servers with the filet mignon and led them to my sisters' table. Amazing!   The food was incredible. My husband spent a couple years in Brazil and is very particular about Brazilian barbecue, and he was blown away by the quality of the meat and flavor. We all were! It was such a great dinner. The servers were constantly making their rounds, everyone ate until they were very satisfied. Dessert was delicious too!   This is the perfect atmosphere for a wedding, people still can't stop telling me what a fun wedding it was! And the price was absolutely unbeatable. You only pay for food, there is no additional cost for reserving the rooms. Based on that, you would think they would try to hurry you along or squeeze you into a smaller space so there would be more room for restaurant guests, but that was absolutely not the case. The number of guests I had could have fit into the large party room, but Anna was worried it would be a tight fit, so she also gave us the adjoining space, for no additional cost! I truly felt like her main goal was to make sure I had a wonderful time. Take it from a bride on a budget, there is no better deal for a wedding. My husband said we can go back to celebrate our anniversary in Vegas and we'll definitely have our celebration anniversary dinner here. I can't wait!",

I've driven by countless times but failed to visit until recently. Located at the corner of Charleston and Ft. Apache, the outside looks impressive, but the interior is even more so. It's large, open, and elegantly decorated.  If you want all-you-can-eat meat, there are two options. \"Prime\" is $39.99 and includes many basic items like garlic steak, BBQ baby back ribs, chicken breasts, drumsticks, flank steak, pork, and sausage. The higher end option is the \"Sterling\" for $49.99, which includes everything in the Prime option plus NY steak, lamb chops, leg of lamb, filet wrapped in bacon, salmon, and rib eye.  My favorites were the lamb chops, filet in bacon, grilled shrimp, trip-tip, and short ribs.   For those that only want the salad bar, you can get that for $24.99. The salad bar has an impressive array of hot and cold dishes, although some turned out to be not so great. The beef carpaccio was under seasoned. Curry mussels were spicy and also felt gritty. The lobster bisque was creamy with rich flavors.  For dessert the creme brulee was textbook perfect with a thick layer of sugar coating the top and creamy custard underneath.  It is a bit pricey (for two adults and one kid we spent well over $200), but if you're fond of Brazilian steakhouses, this one should be on your list.",

    "text": "I have a confession.  Guilty pleasure be damned.    I am a steak snob.    Chicago is famous for several things, but alongside the famous deep dish pizzas are their wet aged steaks.  Beef has been a passion ever since at age 8, my brother and I, being as the latchkey kids typical of those times (nod to Stranger Things), we would come home and raid the fridge.  On this occasion, we found a steak.  Dad loved to cook steak.  He'd sear them perfectly - you'd know because he'd tell my brother and I to grab a towel and start fanning so the smoke detector wouldn't go off.  This particular specimen was a huge slab of chuck roast frozen stiff.  Who knew about defrosting or marinating or any of that - we certainly didn't - all we were certain of was that we were so starved we couldn't bear to wait for Mom or Dad to come home.  We thought we knew.  I knew how to turn on an oven.  And ketchup was good on fries so, in you go.  Forty-five minutes later, dad arrives and smells the kitchen asking if we were cooking something.  Of course we said no.  He found the steak in the trash, where we tossed it.  It was foul.  That's when dad dared not spare the rod.  I discovered churrascarias in the early 2000's starting with Fogo de Chao  and another soon after that was owned by White Sox coach Ozzie Guillen.  This turned into a summer of steak, once dating a girl by taking her on a whirlwind foodie tour on all the churrascarias we could find.  We didn't care - we were still in our 20's and our metabolisms were still on overdrive.    Needless to say, churrascarias are MY thing.  Fast forward 10 years to Vegas.  My wife and I tried nearly all the churrascarias in town.  The chains.  The ones off strip.  Some good, some bad, some whose quality at first encounter was a shadow of their former glory.  Today, my friends.  We found the best churrascaria ever.  Ever.  Why?  Because their Sunday brunch includes the full on churrascaria menu, but also breakfast.  Yes! Omelette stations and waffles!  The maple syrup (it was national maple syrup day earlier this week) was the real deal.  The kind that refuses mightily to leave the ladle and have to be coaxed gently into each crevice.  But I digress.  Unapologetically, I love waffles.  The salad bar has a decent lobster bisque and they also offer clams, much to my wife's delight.  She also loved the white rice and black beans, which is cooked with a pork or bacon in the traditional Spanish style.  The meats are standard top sirloin picanha, garlic steak, ham, roasted pineapple (delish), beef rib.  The difference is that they are seasoned and cooked just right.  What I mean by that is that the chef has preserved the taste of the beef unique to the cut without overpowering the flavor with spices.  This is the way a churrascaria should be - each and every time.  Mea maxima mea culpa for the lengthy preamble.  I highly recommend and would go so far as saying this is a Las Vegas Best.",

Drinks at the bar were on point. The bartender was very attentive and helpful.  I would return. **update So after we got our $300+ bill for four adults and two kids I had to re-think some things. We were charged for three lemonades and were only given two $11+, the dessert is NOT included in the meal, don't be fooled...and they do not tell you this as you are ordering something for everyone.  We went at 730 and they shut down at 9, we weren't able to get all the paid desserts like donuts and grilled pineapple.  I've been to other Brazilian Steakhouses and the salad bar was a little more abundant. The sauces were good, the sides brought to the table (veggies) were ok.  Would I return? I would come to happy hour, but not the Buffett with 6 people.",

Large and open feel with relaxing walls of water on one side of the dining room and behind the bar.  The salad bar had so many choices and the best homemade meatballs Ever! It really is much more than a salad bar!   The whole expierance was super fun!  There was 5 of us and we all enjoyed the steller service and the outstanding food!  We all selected the highest level with the 21 different Meats I believe it was and we're not disappointed!   The bacon-wrapped filet was incredible, and dipped into a peppercorn sauce made it even better! The tri-tip and the top sirloin we're all so amazing!   I read other comments and some of the reviews that people felt they didn't have an opportunity to try everything. That was not the case with us, and if there was something that we wanted that was not coming around all we had to do was ask!!!  They were also very accommodating to special requests, and the manager came around at least twice to make sure we were enjoying our meal!   I had no idea chicken could taste as good as this does but they're Sweet Chicken was delicious!   Honestly I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant!   Every single one of the employees that we came in contact with and there were a lot, we're very friendly and attentive to our needs!  The food was amazing, the restaurant was beautiful, this is exactly what you hope for in a special occasion meal!  And in our case we were celebrating 2 birthdays and they even managed to make that special as well!  I honestly would give this more than five stars if I could!    I'm looking forward to the next special occasion as I will be celebrating it at Via Brasil!!  Thank you to everyone that made our night wonderful and very memorable!",

We had a reservation for 6:30pm. We got there about 6:20 and were told we were checked in. Standing around for more than 30 minutes we start seeing people who came after us getting sat.   Perhaps thy had an earlier reservation time? I surmise that while possible probably not. My husband goes up and asks how much longer and we are told we're next. Then three more couples get sat. I ask again and it's a lot of um I'm not sure what's happening you should be next. Boom another couple goes. I thought my head was going to explode. By this time I'm staring like some crazed lunatic at all of the hosts. Finally we get to our table. A lady (Manager?) comes over, apologizes and asks what she can get us for drinks. Saying that they were on her.  The food was good but I don't think they can handle the big crowds. The same guys came over with the same three types of meat. Long story short, it was ok. But not a special place for Valentine's Day. PS. The drinks were not comped sooo yeah thanks.",

My server was the best can't remember his name but it started with a V.

    "text": "The boyfriend and I ate here for Easter, since I had given up red meat and was dying for a fix. Of course, we had to go rodizio-style, and I wanted to at least experience the dinner offerings.  So, we ended up getting a 2:15pm reservation for this place.  DEFINITELY worth the wait, since we got to choose from the full 16 types of meat (instead of 6).  Yes, the price was $36/person, but it was worth every penny.  Even though they gave us some broccoli, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese bread, I barely ate any of thee carbs, since I had to save room for the MEAT.  I did make sure to save room for the salad bar, since it included salmon with a passion fruit sauce, salad, peppers, portobello mushrooms, marinated mushrooms, caprese salad, meats/cheeses, beef carpaccio, chicken salad, seafood salad, etc.  I ate just a few small selections from the salad bar, since I was all about the meat.  OMG.  I was in heaven.  I tried anything and everything that was steak.  The Picahna (Top Sirloin) and Garlic Picahna were to die for.  So juicy and delicious.  They even had a different type of garlic steak, which was also good.  I also tried the Prime Rib, Lamb, and Flank Steak, but I mostly filled up on the Picahna and Garlic Picahna.  I'll admit, though, that the Flank Steak and Prime Rib were delicious, but my only objective was to eat Picahna.   They also had garlic bread that was almost immediately snatched up after the server came out from the kitchen.  It tasted like it was garlic sourdough bread.  Whatever it was, delicious.  I didn't really want to bother eating the Pineapple and Ham, Ribs, Pork, Chicken, or Sausage, so I really can't comment on those.  By the time that the Salmon was brought out, I was just too stuffed.  Next time.    I also saved some room for dessert, since I saw a couple of ladies pushing around a dessert cart (even though it was a little extra, it was worth it).  It was all over for me once I saw that they had tiramisu (among other things)...I just felt like they were taunting me with their dessert selection, since it seemed that they were pushing the cart around in front of me while I was enjoying my meat.  I did, however, have the tiramisu, and it was worth the wait/saved space.  The wait staff was great, although we did quite a bit of waiting before they refilled my water and before they brought out the check.  They did come by quite a few times to ask if we wanted more wine, though.    I'll admit that when they came around, the staff was quite attentive.  We also received a $20 gift card to be used toward dinner.    I would've probably given them 5 stars, except for the few gripes that I had about the service.  I can't wait to come back.",

I really have not been happy with the Brazilian meat fest restaurants in this town so far, and I've tried to Texas de Brazil and Pampas, which were both pretty awful.  Via Brasil Steakhouse was not really impressive either, as I had a huge stomach ache after eating here, but not because of filling up so much.    A lot of the meat was fairly tough and mostly not that flavorful to me.  However I did like the beef ribs, as they were cut off the bone and delicious.  The salad bar is decent, but if you come to a Brazilian steakhouse for the salad, I would go to Texas de Brazil first.  There's more variety for about the same price.  What makes this restaurant stand out however from other Brazilian steakhouses is the immense amount of sides you can order, which are all complimentary.  Normally, you get a few different sides and the rest is at the salad bar.  Here, there's tons including bananas, different vegetables, fries, and other potato fare.  Loved it!  The service is also very good, almost intrusive as they come around constantly to check up on you.",

It was quaint, only about 30 people but we were all well tooken care of. Anna was amazing and helpful from the very beginning and was extremely accomodating towards our every need. Anna let us bring in decorations from the night before the event and said they would set up for us the day of the wedding as long as we explained how we wanted everything set up, so we didnt have to stress over it because it is \"your special day\" as she said. They also have hookups for audio/video from a laptop for music etc plus decorative lighting for the walls. All the waiters and bussers were on top of their game that night especially Felipe. He constantly asked if we missed any of the meats or needed more sides. We had a two hour open bar and he definitely made sure we had enough to drink. Even though I had a drink already he let me know the open bar was about to end and if I wanted another Long Island, im in Vegas so how could I say no to free liqour? The bartender also made sure the drinks were nice and stiff. I will recommend this place to anyone in Vegas and will be back in the near future! Hats off to the staff, your service will not be forgotten.",

    "text": "Everything was excellent...salad bar was top notch but try not to load up on the hot dishes if you want to make room for the meats. My faves were the beef ribs, garlic top sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon. I love the option to choose your sides, too (yucca fries were great). They also had servers going around with some type of baked mozzarella and hot garlic bread.   The only thing that bothered me early on was the GM (the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars).I received a buy one get one free email for being part of the e-club. I gave my email when making the reservations. Apparently they wrote the email address incorrectly but the GM approached us at our table (as we were barely starting to eat our salads) accusing me of using someone else's coupon because my email wasn't in their database. I repeated my email address to make sure he had the right one but he didn't bother listening or double checking. So I said I can show the email on my phone and he immediately said I probably had someone forward it to me. After showing the email on my phone which was obviously sent to me directly, he realized they wrote the email wrong. He didn't really apologize for his mistake nor his approach. It made us feel uncomfortable but we chose to ignore it so we could enjoy our meal. Other than that, all the servers and front staff were very friendly. A sincere apology from the GM would have been nice.",

Sides taste pretty good too. I think the only thing that bugs me is its location since it's so far from the strip.",

    "text": "My husband made a reservation for the family on Friday night for 7:30.  We had a groupon and wanted to use it, so that was the biggest incentive, plus payday meant I had money to spend.  The long week at work also meant I was ready to relax and eat good food. Walked in and our table was ready.  The service was amazing!  Since it was our first time, we had to learn a little about the process.  Everyone was very attentive to us all.  We got clean plates every so often, and water was refilled before it ran out. The food was delicious.  My 3 year old could not get enough.  The salad bar had risotto, salad, seafood, mushrooms, rice, and other inviting items.  There were also side dishes you could order.  We got fries for the kids, and asparagus and collard greens for hubby and I.  Then came the meat!  When I turned my card over to green, the servings came nonstop!  There was skirt steak, top sirloin, pork rib, beef rib, prime rib, bacon wrapped turkey, bacon wrapped beef tenderloin, pork tenderloin, chicken legs, frog legs, my  favorite corn, and I don't remember what else.  By the end of dinner, my 3 year old kept asking for more steak!  They brought some out just for him.  For dessert, we had the creme brulee.  It was a huge portion that all of us could share.  It was nice and creamy, not to sweet and was a nice finish to a fantastic dinner. For all four of us, our bill with the groupon came out to 73 and change.  I tipped 20.  The pricing is great especially since the kids are free.  I definitely think it is worth the money.  If you want to go to Via Brasil, but are on the fence or think that it is a lot to spend, I would say GO GO GO.",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed and embarrased with the lack of service tonight.  There was nine in our group and three ordered the Rodizio Sterling, so they can have the seafood. The salmon took an hour to serve, after informing us it would take 10 minuites. When it finally came, it was too dry, so a waste of money and our time waiting.  They came around only twice to serve two  shrimp at a time, which was served an hour inbetween. The Rodizio Prime, listed more meats than what was actually served. They kept serving the same three meats.  We asked our server to change one of the orders to the Prime because we had been waiting a long time for the salmon. The server didn't appologize. The manager spoke to us, who didn't seem to understand the frustration of her customers, nor cared that we were unsatified with the service. She was not friendly and for a bill that was over $500.00, was debating with us for a $10.00 reduction on the bill. They were not busy, so the lack of service was no excuse. The side dishes are all you can eat, but they never came around to ask us if we needed more. I was very embarrassed, because I recommend this resturant to our out of town quests, who actually paid for the dinner. I will not be returning, neither will the other quests in the party. Too pricey for the poor service and what a rip off. Make sure you count the types of meats they serve. They list alot, but only bring out a few.",

The waiters and staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is quite nice, less hectic than other Brazilian places out there. You can get your pick of the liter when it comes to side choices, I prefer the asparagus or take a look at their salad bar. The downside is, you must make reservations, or prepare to wait! They did go up in their prices since last year, meaning when I first went there dessert was included and now it is not. Other than that, I am a fan of Via Brasil!",

    "text": "Via Brasil is a Brazilian churrascaria that is pretty far off the strip.  Unless money is no object, I wouldn't recommend travelling by taxi. Odds are your taxi ride will cost more than the meal itself.  If you are sick of the buffets and looking for a meat coma, this is the place.  Walking in, we felt we came under-dressed as the place had an upscale feel to it.  A nice place to go when you are all dressed-up  But Monday night seemed pretty slow and the few people there were all casually dressed.  Salad bar had some interesting items such as carpaccio.  The quality of all the skewer meats we tried was excellent.  Every piece we tried was flavorful and amazingly tender.  While there are 18 choices offered on the menu, we maybe saw maybe 12 of those 18 rotating through (but again, that may have been due to it being a weeknight).  18 styles of meat offered on the menu: pork ribs pork loin ribeye salmon sausage chicken drumsticks lamb chops turkey with bacon skirt steak suckling pig picanha (top sirloin) chicken breast flank steak beef ribs garlic picanha tenderloin in bacon leg of lamb prime rib  Desserts were top-notch as well.  I had the creme brulee which was a fairly large order and was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.  My friend had the coconut flan and that was an excellent choice as well.  Save room for dessert if you can.  Service was excellent (on the weeknight).  Skewers came by quickly and waiters came by frequently to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything.  Highly recommended.",

Everyone from the kids to the adults were very impressed with everything you did and I would like to thank you for making her party the success it was.  I can't neglect to mention your hostess she was also amazing and we received many compliments how cheerful and helpful she was for our guests.

    "text": "Being someone that absolutely loves Brazilian establishments, I would not rank Via Brasil Steakhouse in my top 10!  The main reasons for my ranking was due to the price and the taste of the poultry items and salmon.  The bacon wrapped turkey was horrible...dry and overly salty.  I usually go by the mindset that anything wrapped in bacon is awesome, but that did not hold True for that item!  All the chicken items I tried did not impress and I made sure to pass on them the rest of the night.  The salmon with their mango sauce was ok , but the salmon was dry and didn't have much flavor either.  Now, the red meat options were amazing and well seasoned and prepared.  From the bacon wrapped fillet to the flank steak I could not get enough of the red meat items.  The wait staff was very good and constantly providing clean plates.  The salad bar was your standard Brazilian fare with nothing special, but for $45 a plate I would expect a more robust salad bar and better tasting poultry items.  I've had much better options from Brazilian restaurants that charge $25-$30 per plate. And what the hell is with the garlic bread on a skewer?",

Not only does she not know how to write, but she doesn't know how to run a restaurant. She's also incorrect with her statement that I finished the meat dishes. She came by while I tried to eat the flank steak as I'm sure she could see we were having a hard time chewing it. She offered to bring some ribeye that I never ordered as she said it was more tender. It was more tender but half of it was fat so I couldn't eat that. She ended up charging me for the flank steak that I had to spit out, the ribeye that I didn't order, and the short rib which was disgusting.",

    "text": "If you've never been to a churrascaria or Brazilian steakhouse, your first experience will likely be 5 stars simply from the wow factor of unlimited sumptuous meat being carved table-side and the opulence of a lavish salad bar that could serve as a meal in itself.  Pretty much everything I say onward will likely be inconsequential.  However, if you've been around the block a time or two as I have and want the tale of the tape between two local heavyweights (Texas de Brazil(TDB) vs. Via Brasil(VB)) going at it for twelve rounds, let's get it on!  Round 1 (Ambience)  This may come down to personal preference since there is definitely an upscale vibe with soothing waterfalls and romantic lighting upon entering VB, but not sure if I liked the feng shui of the salad bar in the middle without any partitioning of the tables into separate little rooms for added intimacy.  TDB definitely has a more upbeat vibe with a casual bar area where you can await guests and separate little rooms although definitely more crowded and noisy since it is more bustling with turnover of guests.   Winner: Push  Round 2 (Cheese bread) If you took the most perfect cheese puff and turned it into bread form, this is pretty much the pinnacle of that transformation.  TDB has a slightly cheesier flavor, which gives it a slight edge.  Winner: TDB  Round 3 (Salad bar) For first-timers (or as I like to call them, churrascarookies), you never want to overfill your plate on the salad bar, as tempting as it may be.  However, it's good to wet one's appetite on some items to balance the meat fest to come.  I felt the overall quality was superior in the salad bar at TDB since they offered lobster bisque and focused more on artisanal cheeses and light seafood/veggies options, whereas at VB, there was one too many pasta options like cheese ravioli and other pasta salads, which are like underhanded tactics to fill you up to limit your meat intake.  Winner: TDB  Round 4 (Beverages) VB took a knockdown in this round since the waiter sat us down and presented us with options for water(still or sparkling?) and upon choosing still, he charged us for two bottles of some premium water at 7 bucks/bottle without clueing us in about the option for tap water since we assumed it was complementary.  They also failed to carry Antarctica Guarana, the most popular soda in Brazil and something I look forward to anytime I venture into a Brazilian restaurant.  TDB would never allow the water fiasco to occur and always carry my non-alcoholic beverage of choice.   Winner: TDB  Round 5 (Opening meats) Surprisingly, VB opens with a baked salmon served with passion fruit/mango sauce....not what I expected but really good, and the table-side presentation was a nice touch.  Usually at TDB, they start you off with some non-premium beef wrapped in thick bacon or some heavy pork/chicken option.  Winner: VB  Round 6 (Lamb) Leg of lamb was sufficiently juicy and came with a nice mint jelly, but TDB offers multiple cuts including the lamb chop, which was unavailable at VB.  Winner: TDB  Round 7 (Fowl) VB definitely had some interesting options including chicken, duck, and chicken hearts (upon request), whereas TDB only has a single dry chicken option which I tend to pass over to allow more room for other meat options.  The chicken and duck were very succulent and tender, and well seasoned here.  Winner: VB  Round 8 (Brazilian sausage) Like the cheese bread, fairly standard and not being a huge sausage connoisseur, I'm not the best judge on this one.  Winner: Push   Round 9 (Side dishes) Taking an intermission from the meats, I think VB offers some additional Brazilian sides like fried/boiled yucca root and sauteed turnip greens which have a more stir-fried crispy preparation compared to the stewed version in soul-food.  Traditional favorites such as fried bananas and mashed potatoes are present at both.  Winner: VB  Round 10 (Beef) Maybe it was the pace of the meats brought to our table, but I felt that the overall quality of the beef cuts were superior at TDB since there were a few cuts that were overly dry and tough at VB although certain cuts were very tender/flavorful.  WInner: TDB  Round 11 (Service) Waitstaff definitely more attentive at TDB and the pace of the meat parade was more even, so I didn't feel like I had to overcrowd my plate and lose track of which meat was which.  The TDB meat carvers also wear a uniform that gives them some more professional flare, which I appreciated.  WInner: TDB  Round 12 (Value) Somewhat tied into service, the server initially took our groupon voucher at the beginning but conveniently left it off in our final bill until we reminded him.  Taking account the variety/quality of meats/salad bar, would have to give slight edge to TDB.    Winner: TDB  By decision,winner of this fight goes to Texas de Brazil,but don't count out Via Brasil in a rematch.  A new fierce challenger has recently arrived into town(Fogo de Chao), so a TKO may be in our midst!",

We had a reservation that I showed up 20 minutes early for but was sat an hour after our reservation time. Another party that had a \"3:30pm\" reservation arrived 20 minutes late and was sat before us. I understand it was a holiday but I do feel that management could have been a little more prepared and not made us wait so long. When we were finally taken over to a table, it was small, not fully setup and there were 7 seats for a party of 8. When we asked if we could use the small table next to us we got attitude and said it was reserved. I said we had a reservation too and have waited for an hour. The lady said \"oh so now you have 8 people\" very rudely. I said no, we always had 8!! Finally after a bunch of back and forth (which should have never been) we were able to pull the table over and add to our table. Maybe they could have comped one meal or the drinks for the inconvenience  but not even an apology, just attitude!  The plus, the meats were really good and the guys carving the meat were very friendly. Could have used more sides but our server was busy and understandably since it was a holiday.   Maybe we will come back, just never ever again on a holiday.   Management - take note, when you realize your guests are upset, don't respond with rudeness and attitudes. Offer a free drink or desert. Make up for the bad experience so that you will have return guests!",

Hey, and with sooo much meat in my system they know to keep my water filled so I don't dehydrate from all the salt intake.  As for the meats, I was lucky enough to sit near the kitchen and had first cuts right off the skewers!  I kept going back for garlic steak, prime rib and the house special.  Can't really go wrong with the other meats.  I was also slightly surprised that the flan for dessert was of very high quality.  Not too sweet and not that crappy bready texture some flans end up being.  An all around great dining experience from service to food to decor.",

    "text": "I try not to hand out 5 stars until I've consistently had a great experience. But this place is on track for the extra star, as based on our experience this weekend, the fella' and I will be back.  When trying to pick out where to eat, I could tell that steak was what was calling to my dinner partner. He picked out this place, and we went on a whim. So Saturday evening, no reservation, we just walk up to the booth and ask for a table. Gal doesn't bat an eye, and offers us a table immediately. She does pause to check and make sure we're okay with a high traffic area next to the buffet, but we aren't picky and it was next to a beautiful towering wine rack.    Due to the odd location of our table, I think we were overlapped on our server, as we had two different guys coming by to check in and joke with us. They didn't overlap too much though and it just meant we had great service!   I've never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse, so I can't compare with other places. But generally, the servers were super welcoming and informative, the salad bar average to good and ohmygosh the delicious meat just kept coming. They had certain items that kept swinging by, but the guys would also check in to see if we wanted to try anything specific off the menu. We had purchased the shorter list of meats, but we didn't even make it through the whole taster list. What I did try was delicious.  I didn't knock any stars off for this next bit. I know that I tend to be a perfectionist, so don't expect any place to completely satisfy me. But, just in case, here's my 'eh' list.   =The salad bar had some delicious items. (Charcuterie board/endive goat cheese) But there was a lot of stuff that I didn't try because I didn't want to fill up on average looking stuff. Not bad looking at all, just higher end average. Of what I did try, the only eh was the Greek Salad roll thing , which was kind of odd. The meat was actually kind of an afterthought and sort of hamburger like in consistency.   =The Brazilian Sausage: Compared to all of the delicious cuts of meat, it was kind of tough and not worth the room it took up in my stomach. I think if it were part of a breakfast meal or an appetizer in another style restaurant, it would be really good, so this one's just a major personal preference. I can see why it's on the menu, it's just not for me.   = The chicken was just a hair on the dry side. This is being super nitpicky though, as it had great flavor. Like, I wish that we weren't so full so I could have had a full piece instead of splitting it with my fella'.   Now that the 'eh' stuff is out of the way, the great list:  =The cuts of meat were tender, flavorful and even though we didn't bother getting any sauces, they stood well on their own. I especially loved the tri-tip, but everything we tried was a well made presentation of the cut. I enjoyed that they were easily able to give me medium rare and my fella' could get the disgustingly rare slices that he loves as we've had many struggles with those requests at lesser restaurants. Also, the bacon wrapped turkey is an unexpected treat, so even though it isn't a red meat, I'd highly recommend trying it.   = The 'courtesy breads'/fired mozzarella, as well as the grilled mushrooms that we ordered as a side were tasty. I only regret that there is so much food I had a hard time eating more than a few bites of anything and tried so little from the side menu.    =The Rigatoni Ala Vodka from the salad bar was spectacular. I love Vodka sauce and have had an 'eh' experience with a few higher end chain Italian place lately. My first bite was an entirely unexpected delight. I earnestly wished that I was just in an italian restaurant so I could devour a plate of the stuff, but sufficed with the token amount I'd procured to taste.   = Service was amazing. I never lacked for food, water or attention. I also really loved the decor. Something about the large open space and pseudo-Greco Roman accents just vibed with me. Plus, in our little odd table, I felt like I had the whole place to myself and it was refreshing.   =The dark Brazilian beer had a rich, full bodied taste. I was a little sceptical of a bottled beer, but I didn't regret choosing it over a glass of wine, as it had a great flavor that complimented the meats.   =MMM! Passionfruit Mousse. It was the perfect end to the rich meal. Light, flavorful and it melted in my mouth. I was glad I had restrained myself from digging in so I could have a little space for a treat at the end.",

I've been to every Brazilian steakhouse in town on more than one occasion to test out service and selection at different time of the year. Now I went here on a whim with my brother. I figured I have to give it a go even though I was really craving another fine steak Resteraunt. I must say it's definitely not bad. They salad bar has a nice selection, the meats are nicely prepared and the side dishes are suitable. Really the only thing lacking for me was depth of flavor in the meat selection.  My rating is strictly based on flavor. Texas de Brazil has tastier meats and bananas as well as some sides that are lacking on this menu. But that's just personal preference!   I definitely would go back and I would take a friend or family member. It's worth a try.",

The cuts of meat were very small compared to Texas de Brazil. The speed at which the meat was coming around was really slow. At one point we were all sitting there with empty plates waiting for someone to come around. The Filet Mignon was fatty. The side dishes were mediocre. The ambiance did not feel like other steakhouses.  Bottom line is, this place is worth maybe 19.99 NOT 50 bucks!  For 49.99 you are MUCH better off spending it at Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chau. I will never be back here nor will I ever recommend this place.",

    "text": "My hubby has a birthday coming up and he wants Texas de Brazil for his special dinner. Since we had been to TDB before, and not tried Via Brasil even though it is in our area, I figured we could give it a shot. I did have an A-OK experience, but I am glad it wasn't his actual birthday dinner or I would have been disappointed we didn't go to TDB.   The \"Rodizio\" dinner is priced at $45.99 per person. A 50 plus item salad bar is included, and you get to try 18 different meats that meat carvers bring to your table on skewers. You can choose if you want what they have and how much. If pink meat isn't your thing, you can request any of the meat be cooked to to your liking. They give each person there own round paper disc that you turn to green when you are ready for more meat and then you turn it to red until you are ready for more or are simply done eating. I was impressed by the fact that the side dishes were included with the meal. They had like 16 to choose from and you can pick as many as you like. That is a nice touch! They ask that you tell them your sides when you first get there so they can start preparing them.   So I am not a vegetarian at all, but I don't eat a whole lot of meat. Tonight was my night to shine as the carnivore I am not. I absolutely succeeded! I first went to the salad bar. I wasn't impressed. There were a lot a seafood options which is great, but not for someone like me who doesn't eat seafood. I didn't feel there was a lot of options for a salad however the veggies they did offer were fresh and delicious. I put some \"Caprese Salad\" on my plate and that was actually very good. As we finished up our salad, the sides we ordered arrived. The \"White Rice\" paired nicely with the \"Sauteed Mushrooms\" and the \"Fried Banana\" was good. Then the meats started coming! I have to admit that the \"Top Sirloin\" known as \"Pichana\" that they claim is the star of the meal was not good at all. The meat was tough and flavorless. The \"NY Strip\", and \"Prime Rib\" were the same, tough meat and flavorless. Then came the \"Bacon Wrapped Turkey\" and THAT is delicious. I'm a huge fan of bacon and the bacon really added a nice flavor to the turkey. Then came the \"Garlic Filet and \"Bacon Wrapped Filet and these two are the star of the meal to me. The filet was so tender and flavorful. I like my meat cooked well done so the server took note of that and made sure to bring me pieces with no pink. I liked my meal, but can't see coming back and paying full price again. Maybe if it were a deal they had going on or something. The meat at first was not good, and the salad bar was not great. I know this isn't TDB, but I do have to compare it because they both have the \"churrascaria\" thing going on. And the salad bar at TDB is worth just eating that alone. The sides were decent, but I only enjoyed a few types of the meat so I'd rather spend the extra to have TDB.   There is a Happy Hour here at Via Brasil Monday - Sunday from 5-8 pm in the patio/bar. Every Sunday they have a \"Sunday Brunch\" from 10 am - 2 pm and have different specials for the brunch so you might want to call and ask if there is a theme for that day. They have several options for events and banquets too.",

There are no menus to make it simple, the salad bar has a great variety of salads, pastas, fruits, cheeses and condiments.

I like my veggies.  I am not a connoisseur of meats, but I think I had sirloin, turkey wrapped with bacon, sausage and skirt steak.   I didn't like the garlic beef which wasn't as tender as the test.   It was all tasty and the service was top-notch.  Everyone from the main host guy to the beverage servers were very polite and attentive.   It is a bit pricey if you order drinks and dessert, but my husband is a bbq fanatic and I let him have his day.  Overall, it was a good off-strip find, but make sure you are hungry so you can make the most of the price.",

Honestly, the servers kept scaring me because I would be in the middle of a conversation and BAM! A sharp rod filled with skewered mouth watering meat is in my face! A sliver of lamb here, a piece of rib eye there and an hour later, I probably consumed an ungodly amount of Brazilian BBQ  that I feared I would never look at meat the same way again!   Didn't have room for desert though. But that's never a bad thing!  I want to go back.",

Am I the only one who thinks dragging in someone to pay full price is dumb. I thought that my companion would pay the same. So I explain to Anna (the manager) she tells me to get out if her restaraunt and dont come back. Its 430 in the afternoon. There was a better way to handle this. It is my birthday dinner. This is bad customer service. Next call to groupon. I will say that I wasnt expecting anything for free. The coupon should state that its only good for one person per table per reservation. No confusion there.  Bait and switch Groupon should choose better when attaching a brand to a business. Anna should learn better manners. Word of mouth is bad advertising when treated poorly.",

The salad bar is ok, the tomato soup is very good! The salads are plain but still good for a snack before the meat comes in, it was my aunts birthday and I asked them to make it special and they made a little cake for her they also sang a happy birthday song! For desert I recommend to order the mousse cup both flavored the chocolate and fruit. I love this steakhouse and I RECOMMEND for you to go here it's beautiful in all ways!",

We'd arrived early for our reservation and had waited outside on their patio. They'd gotten confused with our reservation because we found that we had 1 more child so a party of 10 instead of 9 so they switched our reservation with another party and didn't explain the confusion or switch. There did seem to be a bit of disorganization which was quickly remedied when pointed out. All in all, a good experience but with some room for improvement.",

As soon as we were seated, without being given 2 seconds to look over the menu, we were bombarded and uncomfortably rushed to order. We asked for time to look over the options but the lady ignored our request and forced us to make decisions right then and there.  She wanted our food order before we even had a chance to pick our wines / drinks. She spoke in a rude and demeaning manner so we decided to walk out before the water even got served. We let her know her customer service was the reason why we were leaving and the amazing thing is.... she was surprised. Like she didn't know she was sounding like a b****.

I tried them about 12 year in New York city  and when they open their location in Las Vegas, me and my husband  became great fans of it.  The weekend brunch is great and inexpensive. Their happy hour is probably the best one off the Strip....great food selection (especially the tri tip skewers and yucca fries). Additionally,  the caipirinha is FANTASTIC.....during happy hour seat at the bar and let Raymond (bartender) do his magic with the caipirinhas....he is Awesome! Highly recommended!!!",

You can still bring a vegetarian to a place like this be cause their salad bar area is really good they have all kinds of grilled veggies, cous cous salad, spaghetti stuff like that. I do eat seafood though so stick with ordering shrimp a la carte and eating some of the sides. I didn't order the salmon because it's farm raised Atlantic. Farmed seafood is usually unhealthier than wild. The service is good here and they are on top of it when bringing out all the meats all the people I was with got the rodizio.

We loved the garlic churrasco, the bruschetta was way too dry and way too sweet. The ceviche was good and fresh, but I didn't care for the flavor much. The lobster tails that came out varied way too much in size. Two people in our group got huge tails prompting two other people to order it too, only to be served mini tails that were about a quarter of the size of the first offering. The manager did bring out additional mini tails after we brought it to his attention and gave us some free dessert. Great customer service!

We went there for brunch, and I believe the cost was $25.99.  I didn't think the cost was bad considering all the options of food.    I was able to order a fresh made to order waffle and omelet, and I was also able to try different meats, and ordered blueberry mimosas, which was good.  I really liked the Garlic Steak and Brazilian Pork the most.    Everything was overall good.  Nice service, clean restaurant, and good food.  I would definitely go back to this place whenever I'm back in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I enjoy the multitudes of meat at a Brazilian steakhouse as much as the next guy, but personally prefer other options to Via Brasil. The pricing is reasonable for what is offered, and I appreciate that salad bar-only ($26) is an option (and it includes a few hot dishes), but the main choices are Prime ($40) or Sterling ($50, +$10 for 7 additional meats). Assorted sides are included but dessert and drinks are extra for each package, a la carte available with HH at the bar/lounge. Management and servers were very nice and came by frequently to check on us. Interior is dark and upscale, with a large private area available for groups; gameplay discount menu available ($20 min).  We opted for the Sterling dinner. Salad bar was okay, with chicken marsala and marinara mussels available in addition to cold items and soup. The meats were all fairly good, but I was somewhat annoyed that we had to specifically request some of the additional featured meats for our category. We were able to try the NY steak, grilled shrimp, and rib eye but had to request others like the lamb chops. I would have tried the lamb leg and salmon if they'd been offered but the menu outlining our selection was not on the table and frankly that should be handled by the server not my memory. Meat quality was fairly good, with the garlic steak and bacon-wrapped filet being standouts. but most options were on the tougher side. Sides of asparagus and fried yucca were solid.   TIP: Sign up for their mailing list for the occasional $25 discount coupon.",

However, I've been there twice in the past month and have noticed and appreciated a definite change. Keep in mind,  this is not Texas D' Brazil, however, to their benefit,  they've stopped trying to be. As compared to their competition,  Via Brasil offers different menus for varied wants and tastes. Yes, there are still Gauchos bringing savory meats but some items are by request, keeping them fresh. The salad bar is okay (again compared to the competition) but they've been hitting where it counts, with flavorful additions and service. Management is attentive and the waiters make a great effort to personalize your service. If you have a chance to do so near happy hour, take advantage and grab a great dinner.",

    "text": "I went for the brunch special at Via Brazil steak house, I was completely satisfied with every aspect of this experience. The protein servers were all professional and well spaced out. I don't like it when they stack up on me at the table. The salad bar had a great selection of brunch favorites and classic Brazilian cuisine. The Mimosa girl was a great addition and was a joy to have table side. Waffle and omelet station was also a great addition. Though a temporary set up, it looked professional and the staff stationed there were neat and the waffle toppings were awesome. The bar and wine display are really nice and looks very upscale. The waterfall by the private banquet area is also a great touch of class.  I have only one criticism about this place. The main dining area does have too much of a cafeteria feel. It is too open and bright it loses something in the dining experience. Maybe a darker flooring and window treatments can tie it all in.   Besides that, if you want a great table side experience with great staff and food then this place for brunch is a great option with a great price.",

    "text": "I don't even know how to start this. It was my Anniversary. So we made reservations here. Glad we did. As others had to wait no more than 20-30 mins at about 6:30 so not bad.  When we got sat it wasn't the most desirable table, come to find out it was amazing. We were right next to the Salad Bar. Wasn't bothered by others going to it.  Our server was amazing. We had the 25.00 off coupon, and it was applied no questions asked. She recommended drinks that were amazing. When you get some of them, you are in shock how small they are.... Trust me take a drink. They have a punch, yet still very well balanced. Our server asked if she could surprise us with a round. Let me tell you, the drink was amazing. It was Passion Fruit, Mango, X-Rated... amazing. Just ask they will know.  THE MEAT: All of it tasted great. Though we only saw two different kinds of meat that were exclusive on the Sterling Menu. Though if you ask, they will get it out to you. Huge plus. Everything was exactly what you asked. If they noticed you eat your meat more well done they will try to get some more of your taste out.   Salad Bar: great selection. The whole time I was there, there was someone changing out plates, even if they weren't empty. They stayed in top of it. I just wished they had the Muscles on the hit plates. Though it just shows how they rotate what they have.   In all it was an amazing experience. The only thing is the front of the house staff, as in the host stand, and such. Need better communication. It seemed they were the only ones running around with their head cut off. Still polite though. You have Open Table use it. More so with how large your restaurant is. It makes you feel uncomfortable when you are sitting right there.  Food and Service is so worth it. My side comments are just from being in the food industry.",

    "text": "I have come to this restaurant many times, and I have seen it go from barely ok, to good, to great... and it may now be sliding back down to just \"ok\" when it come to their service. And please don't get me wrong, I will be brutally honest in this review, but this is only with the intention of helping the leadership team at this restaurant identify some disappointing shortcomings I saw during my last visit.   As mentioned earlier, this restaurant has worked hard to become a really great churrasqueria in Las Vegas, but yesterday's visit left much to be desired. Let me explain. Hosting several family members for the holidays, I was torn as to what restaurant I could take them to so they could experience a \"wow\" dining experience, so I chose Via Brazil since they had previously earned my business with great service. In fact, Felipe (our usual waiter) is one of the friendliest and most welcoming waiter there.  Having said that, this visit was disastrous! It started with a long wait for meats to come to the table, then the waiters were slow, uninterested in serving us and borderline rude. For example, after trying to cut a piece of meat off the skewer onto my plate, a waiter spilled steak fat onto my shirt... No big deal as it was an accident. What really upset me was the waiter was completely unapologetic and only asked me if I wanted something to clean myself up with.  With an obvious YES as my response, he walked away for close to ten minutes and the sent a different waiter with a rag to clean up the mess. Really?! You spill food on a customer and this is your attitude?  The second disappointing mishap was their digital frequent diner program. I have been a member for a while but this time it seemed I annoyed the waiter when I asked him to credit me with the visit. In fact, he denied the free desert I had earned (despite there being no disclaimer on the promotion) and then proceeded to give my family members grief about using their frequent diner app because it was \"downloaded on the same day of the visit\". Are you telling me this restaurant spends money in a rewards program only to have its staff discourage diners from using it? That's a shame.   Lastly, here are some other turn offs from the visit: dirty coffee cups, table was not bussed throughout the visit and waiters' appearance, service standards and demeanor left much to be desired.   Please fix this!",

    "text": "Like most Brazilian steakhouses, Via Brasil features an elegant dining room with excellent service. I usually skimp over the salad bar, but the appetizers were really good. The spread had the perfect mix of charcuterie, salad, and vegetables. I enjoyed the crab ceviche, beef carpaccio, and the various assorted grilled items. But, in all seriousness, I was here for the meat, not the salad bar.   Via Brasil jumps to the top of my list for one of the best Brazilian steakhouses for their meats. I loved that the skin of the chicken drumsticks were perfectly crispy. All of the beef (top sirloin, tri-tip) was perfectly medium-rare. One of my biggest gripes about Brazilian barbecue is how salty all their roasts are, but I found all the meats to be well-seasoned without being over-seasoned, especially the crusts. The flavors were amazing. Also, baked cheese? Love it! The cheese paired wonderfully with the meats.   What didn't I like? The rotation of meats didn't come frequently enough and at one point we were at a standstill. There were no ribs, lamb, or fish offered that evening. The other disappointment was the cheesecake for dessert. They actually ran out and I got one of the last slices, but it was far from what they labeled \"NY cheesecake.\" It was heavy and generic. I should've gone for the Brazilian doughnuts with ice cream.   I'll end with a positive note. The tableside basket of cheese-baked bread balls were simply amazing. Single-most addictive item on the menu.",

I was expecting to get $20 email signup coupon from Texas which I never got.  Based on reading reviews from yelp, I decide to go to Via as I don't like \"special\" treatment given by pampas when people use coupon (won't give you the high quality meat and cut). I got the $25 discount from Via right after I confirmed my email address.  I made the reservation online the night prior to my visit for Friday 5pm (they don't offer weekdays lunch, only dinner on weekdays).   Based on how I was granted at the front door, I believe they expect you to make reservation for your visit.  We were lead to a table at the far end, I asked if we can sit closer to the salad bar.  We actually ended up sitting couple steps outside the kitchen where we got all the fresh cut.  I got the sterling dinner ($50 each). It was not busy when we arrived, we are the second table with the BBQ grill. We got all the attention we want, different meats pilled up on my plate. I have tried everything except  BBQ Pork Ribs, Salmon, Brazilian Pork, and Chicken Hearts.  Conclusion: - Services (I showed them the $25 coupon, and I told them it is my first time in their restaurant, I get special treatment, server and manager visited our tables multiple times to check if everything is ok, how is the food).  My husband does not eat pork, they make the filet without bacon for him and with bacon for me.   - shrimp was offered without asking  Must try:  Beef Ribs, lamb chop (juicy and tender) Great: Tri-tip, Filet, Prime Rib, shrimp, asparagus, fried banana (crunchy and not soared with oil).   Good / try one first but don't stuff your face with them: Picanha, garlic steak, flank steak, turkey wrapped in bacon, chicken kabab (too sweet for my taste), sausage (taste like hot links) OK: Ribeye - I had high hope for it since that is my favourite cut, however I do not like the seasoning (not sure if that's the sage/orgeno, too strong for me) I told the meat guy that ribeye is the only thing I am waiting for, he got right on it and brought the ribeye out and cook it in front of us (and ask us how well we like the meat). OK to skip: chicken drumstick  - I wish they offer dorma and grilled pineapple for sterling dinner.   Tip: if you are looking for a certain cut of meat, let the meat server knows, they will bring them when it is ready (that's how I got the garlic steak and ribeye)",

Brunch is 24.99 pp normally however I joined the on line e-club for free and was immediately sent via email an invite for 19.99 pp, hell yeah! FYI kids under 5 eat free. All you can eat/AYCE!  Wow, I came across this restaurant and brunch info by accident while browsing the web and I am sure glad I did!  The description of the brunch was mouth watering and I have been dreaming of going for four weeks now, was just waiting for a Sunday that my boyfriend did not work.  Complimentary drinks, fresh squeezed pineapple, strawberry and orange juice are available for $3.50 per glass.  They have a beautiful super fresh hot and cold Gourmet salad bar, that includes lobster bisque soup, bacon, sausage, hashed browns, cheese blintz,  and many homemade salads and a delicious ranch dressing! I really enjoyed the Caprese salad mmm yum and they have bottles of the best Olive oils around that you can use. My boyfriend really enjoyed the roasted peppers and eggplant. This is just listing a few as they have close to 35 items in their hot and cold gourmet salad bar!  Fresh omelet station, eggs benedict or eggs any style for your own creation made to order, and Belgium waffles made fresh as well!  You are given a rodizio marker for your table and when you want meat brought to your table you place it on the green side, and when you have had enough or are working on what you have then you flip it over to the red and they will not come to your table.  Mmmm yum they also give you a side of fresh mashed potatoes and some delicious fried bananas which were the best I have ever had in my life!!!!!!  They have a cart of fresh banana bread and another bread,  however once she said banana I knew I must have and did not hear what the other was. It was the best banana bread I have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had seconds on that for sure!  The brunch is rodizio style so there are 6 choices of meats coming around at all times to make the rounds to your table. They are generous and are constantly on the move making sure you are satisfied and have everything you need or could ever want!   List of meats cut table side. Top sirloin, tenderloin wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, prime rib, chicken drumsticks, smoked ham and pineapple. Keep in mind this selection is only for brunch, their dinner service has closer to 16 meats.   The bacon wrapped turkey was an explosion of flavor all up in my mouth! The prime rib was delicious and melted in my mouth like butta!  The service was Amazing, everyone on staff catering to our every need, refills of iced tea galore, my glass never even had the chance to get half full at any point!   They cleared plates, brought plates, folded our napkins back up every time we left the table, they were on it! This restaurant for sure values and appreciates their customers!  Heather was an Amazing Server by the way, her smile and sweet, helpful, knowledgeable personality was refreshing. If I owned a restaurant I would love to have her on my staff!  This was a real treat for my sweetie and I also was my first time for rodizio style meat service it sure was a winner!  We will be back because I know I will be dreaming about this place and be itching to get back really soon!  The best service ever in all of my dining experiences I swear! I told my boyfriend that I feel like a Queen totally treated like royalty in every way! They totally spoiled us with anything and everything, I am still Amazed and super happy with our experience.   Top quality food and very tasty and creative!",

I finally asked them to bring some of the meat on the selection and took another 15-20 minutes for it to come.  When the manager came by and I explained what was going on, she started to argue with me.  I explained it was my daughters birthday and I did not want to argue.  I actually had to ask her to leave 3 times.  The food itself was a 3 out of 10.  The meat was tough, over cooked and low quality.  I will agree with other reviews here the other two Brazilian steakhouses in town are light years better than this place.  Don't waste your money.  The management of this place is an embarrassment.  Never again!",

Have tried their Rodzilian dinner with beautiful salad bar and lovely meats, Sunday Brunch  (includes the same menu) and Happy Hour..  Beautiful room - more restful than the competition and very attentive service and friendly bartenders. .   Happy Hour customers agree with me it's the best one in Las Vegas even with their recent price increases. .  Beer, wine, well drinks, mojitos and Capirinhas  range  from $4 - $6 dollars during HH.   HH Food is generally  small plates with some entree alternatiaves.   . Very large HH menu.  Some of my favorite dishes: Caesar Salad 4.50  (best in town and good portion) you can add chicken or steak to make it a meal.  Beef Carpaccio 6.50,  Asparagus Risotto  6.50 (large portion), They also have small portions of the steakhouse options which are yummy.  Restaurant has a lot of options for group events as well (Private dining room etc...)  This is a family run operation. The son and his wife manage this location and are always welcoming and friendly.  Friendly customers. This is my go to spot in Vegas.

First off, they started bringing out the meat and even though we all had our card flipped, weren't offering it to all of us. The waitress never took our order for side dishes. She claimed to put them in and they didn't come until asked for them repeatedly. Even then, we got 2 trays of mashed potatoes, one fry, and one tray of plantains. There were 12 of us. Also, they have this grilled mozzarella that is to die for. (The only thing I'll miss there.) Well I asked for it no less than 5 times. Finally, as we finished up, someone walked passed with a try of it and I had to grab the guy so I could have some. THEN, the kicker! I left cash on the table as a tip and wrote cash on my receipt, the waitress literally ran after us in the parking lot saying there was no cash on the table. What?! The entire experience was just bad. Go to Texas de Brazil. Everything is much better there.",

We went for our anniversary and I have to say the staff at Via Brasil made it much more special. We were greeted by a very nice girl working as a hostess. When we got to our table we were quickly attended to. We ordered our food and got up to go to the salad bar. Everything was fresh and hot. We had already unfolded our napkins and when we arrived back at the table the napkins were refolded and looked like they hadn't been tocuhed. Our drinks were also refilled. When we finished eating from the salad bar the meats began arriving.  Every thing we had was hot, fresh, juicy and absolutely amazing. I have not one complaint about this place. The waiters were SUPER friendly and very attentive.  We will absolutely be back",

Brunch was a very different experience, grilled meat was very good of course but service was way off. Nobody explained the brunch menu and there is no printed menu; waiter forgot drink orders; waiter was very slow to check on table - not enough waiters appears to be the problem. I never did find out if they serve their vegetables for brunch in fact I'm still not sure what defines this as brunch. There was a waffle station, the salad bar with some non-brunch type hot items in the bar and the grilled meat. Really didn't meet up to our expectation. Also 30 minutes late in seating us from our reservation time. Fix the service, create a real brunch menu and add waiters. And fix the problem with not honoring reservations at the reservation time.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed with this place after our visit last Sunday for my grandmothers 75th birthday. There were 7 of us and we all ordered the Sterling dinner which is $49.99 per person. The Sterling, which is the more expensive choice, offers 21 meats including bacon wrapped filet, porterhouse, lamb, strip steak, etc. All the meat you can want plus unlimited sides and salad bar, sounds good right? WRONG!   I'll start off with the salad bar. It was very tiny compared to its competitors. There was a small section of lettuce and toppers to make your own salad, some specialty cold cuts and cheeses, a few hot items and some cold salads. Blah. Nothing stood out, but obviously the salad bar is just a filler. Skip this if at all possible.   The sides. They have a good selection, but again nothing really stood out and these are also fillers. We got the steak fries, which are not the thick fries they are actually skinny so I don't know why they call them steak fries, fried banana, mashed potatoes, yucca fries and sauteed mushrooms. All served with your meal, and unlimited.    The \"rodzio\" style dinner left something to be desired. As I said we all got the Sterling dinner. Of the 21 meats on the menu, we may have tried 15 and that's because they did not offer the others. We were offered shrimp, garlic bread, and flank steak a ton of times, yet the expensive meats such as the filet were offered sparingly. When they finally brought the filet to the table everyone opted for some. It was wrapped in bacon which was hardly cooked, so it made the filet chewy and overly salty. Most took the bacon off. When they came around again we asked if they could make the filet without bacon, and they said sure and it would be 10 minutes. No problem. I am not joking when I say we did not get the filet for a good 40 minutes even after we talked to a manager who said she would get it out to us asap. She did mention that the filet had been offered to our table 3 times, which is interesting that they keep track of that. I guess to throw it back in your face when you complain? I'm sorry.. Is $50 a person not enough to warrant more than 3 trips to our table with the prime meats? Disgusting.   Side note the place was not busy at all, we went Sunday night at 5:30 and there were maybe 8-10 tables so I am not sure what the deal was. Most of the meats we did get were good. I enjoyed the top sirloin and the filet without bacon. I can't look past the bad service and the fact we weren't offered all the meats that we paid for. Looking at their menu now, I never saw the lamb shank, pork ribs, tangy chicken, salmon, or Brazilian pork. They sat us at a big round table at the back of the restaurant in the corner, I kinda feel like we were just shoved off to the side and ignored. Oh and another thing is be prepared to eat in the dark. They have the lights down so low, you can't even tell which meat is which and what your eating. Super annoying. I get wanting to have ambiance, but they go a little too far.   And finally the icing on the cake is that we told them it was grandma's birthday and wanted to get her a piece of cheesecake, her favorite dessert, and they brought caramel flan. What the hell! She doesn't even like flan. It's like they didn't care to accommodate any of our requests at all. We were paying for the dessert, although it should have been comped after spending $350, but they still couldn't get it right. Extremely, extremely disappointing. After expressing our concerns to the manager she did take $10 off everyone's dinner, which is the only why I gave them a star. But that won't save them. Texas DE Brazil from here on out. I'll never step foot in this place again.",

My husband paid the extra $$ to get the \"best\" meat, of which he got none. Our waiter was amenable until my husband started asking where the chicken hearts and Leg of Lamb were, then he was conspicuously absent. After asking three different people for these items the manager showed up. Things went from bad to worse. He proceeded to make inane excuses and argue with my husband as to why the chicken hearts etc were not being served. About this time the \"leg of lamb\" appeared. Leg of lamb it was not. My husband knows leg of lamb. It got so ridiculous we ask for our check, with still no apology, and proceeded to leave. On the way out I stopped to get the name of the owner so I could complain. I noticed the girl was looking over my shoulder I turned in time to see the manager gesturing to her! He rushed over at this point and told me he was the owner and to take our business elsewhere! No problem $158 down the drain. If this gentleman was the owner I feel sorry for the employees and anyone who dares to venture into this ripoff, sorry excuse for a Brazilian Steakhouse. Would we return? NO!",

    "text": "I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.  I'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.  After you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!  Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the \"Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic.\" Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.  If I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.  Oh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!  One thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.  OK this is long enough. Way too long. FOUR STARS!",

They will carve a delicious portion of meat right off their skewer and directly onto your plate. All of the selections are hot and fresh.  Charles and the flank steak are my favorite, followed very closely by Rodrigo and the prime rib.   There are so many tasty meats to choose from, the price for lunch or dinner is well worth it!  Be sure to try the signature Pichana (top sirloin), sliced rare to medium rare. So delicious!!  Carol is a delightful hostess and always has a warm smile and a friendly word for us.  Adam in the dining room is so warm and genuine.  We love all of the staff at Via Brasil, no matter how long it is between visits, we are always treated like family.  There is a reason we keep returning. It is not just the food but it is the staff!  Thank you for being so awesome to us and Charles, thank YOU for honoring my special request on Christmas.   Regardless of how busy you are, you always seem to find time to bring me some melted mozzarella and I adore you for that.  Merry Christmas and a happy, safe, prosperous new year to all of our friends at Via Brasil! See you all again very soon!",

They even remembered what temperature meat each of us preferred and they go out of their way to ensure you get more of the meats you like or want more of. The red sangria is absolutely delicious too. Happy hour prices are available at the bar (not at your table) so I recommend getting there 10 min early if you want happy hour prices and just bring them to your table. Love this place!",

Via Brasil has a fresh and fabulous salad bar. I saw them filet a fresh salmon. A giant reasonably priced porterhouse. The endless meat and seafood tableside service is expertly served by personable staff. The owners come to your table. And it's just great!  Not to mention,  this is the only one with a happy hour and outdoor seating!  Love it!",

    "text": "Impeccable, attentive service is always a big plus, but it really just comes down to the food in the end, right? Well, Via Brazil does not disappoint. I probably don't have the stomach capacity for this place, but even though I had to skip a few of the selections, I cannot complain. Even the salad bar items were top notch and had more than just the typical carb fillers. I took small portions of mozzarella, mushrooms and roasted peppers as my sides and sampled a couple of the \"hot\" items like asparagus risotto and coconut chicken (both excellent).  I tried most of the meats, bowing out at times because the service was almost too fast! I could barely keep up, having to temporarily flip my coaster to \"red\" to avoid plate overload. Everything I tried was tender, flavorful and served up hot and fresh from the skewer. Definitely bring your appetite and a lot of cash- this restaurant is not cheap. Bill for two, with tip, easily topped $100 AFTER the $50 Groupon certificate. Worth every dime. I wish I could have crammed down more than two bites of flan and a small Cappuccino for dessert.   Atmosphere was chic and ambient and I cannot say a single negative thing about any of the staff. Nothing was \"over the top\", but it is definitely a nice place for an excellent meal.  I have not tried any of the other Brazilian steakhouses in town, but I've been to a few on the East Coast- Via Brazil tops them all so far. Be sure to try a Passion fruit caipirinha- dang, that's a good drink. I only needed one, I assure you.",

This visit was for my wife's 40th birthday; I told them why were coming when I made the reservation.  The restaurant was about half full when we arrived right on time for our reservation.  The hostess welcomed us, and wished my wife a happy birthday.  The service, as usual, was spot on.  The head waiter checked on us on a regular basis, making sure we had everything we wanted/needed.  The wait staff refilled our drinks without being asked to do so, and despite what others have said, the \"premium\" meats came by on a VERY regular basis.  The meal is definitely a splurge, but WELL WORTH IT!!!",

I've eaten at a place similar to this on the Strip called Pampas Brazilian Grill in Planet Hollywood but Via Brasil is so much better! They have more buffet options here like: Seafood Salad, Mushroom Ravioli, Asparagus Risotto, Tabbouleh just to name a few. They also bring warm side dishes to your table like fried Plantains, fried Yucca root ..(tastes just like a french fry..it tastes like it's good for you too), broccoli, and mashed potatoes. They also bring out their warm rolls that taste like soft warm Cheez It's ..those are addicting! You must keep control of yourself or you will be too full to taste their wide array of meat that they bring to your table. Some of my favorite meats were the sirloin, prime rib and I don't usually say this but the lamb was very tasty! The Pineapple Sangria that I had with the meal just enhanced all the flavors in the food. This was so worth it!",

    "text": "Like a recent Yelper's review of Via Brasil, I dont give 5 star reviews often but Im thrilled when Im able to.  In my book, to earn 5 stars means a restaurant has mastered its niche.  That is, a hamburger stand could certainly earn 5 stars like a fine french dining experience.  Its all a mater of context.  That being said, Via Brasil is definitely a 5 star Palace of Food.    I have eaten at plenty of Brazilian Churascarrias over the years and I can say Via Brasil takes the cake over all them.  I recently went on a weeknight with my nephew to celebrate a new job and we were immediately taken back by the amazing synthesis of upscale and casual in the same environment.  The restaurant is beautiful or being in a Summerlin strip mall.  They have their salad bar in the center of the restaurant and a small, but comfortable bar off to the side.  The restaurant is ringed by windows and while there isnt much a view, it does get beautiful colors and light during the sunset.  The staff immediately sat us, described how the restaurant worked and the fun began.  The first thing we were greeted with was this soft, warm cheese bread that was fantastic.  We then approached the salad bar and soon found out that salad is but a small component of the overall spread.  This \"salad\" bar had warm dishes as well like Ravioli, scalloped potatoes, stroganoff and a sort of seafood Ciappiono, all of which were delicious.  As for its cold selections, there were pasta salads, fresh mussels, beef carpaccio, caprese and a host of other amazing & fresh foods.  I had to be careful, otherwise I was going to get full just on the salad bar so I limited my intake although I could have easily just partook in the salad bar all evening.  In fact, I think its an option for around 20 bucks for those not inclined to enjoy the rodizio selections.    After the fabulous salad bar, we began the meat parade.  Using a small disc thats green on one side and red on the other, we flipped it green and a constant delivery of protein was soon ambling its way over to our table on skewers where the waiters slice it off table side.  For a couple items, like the suckling pig and the salmon, they actually to table side carving off a cart.  The meats were amazing with special recognition going to the bacon wrapped turkey, salmon, garlic sirloin, parmesan pork loin and flank steak.    As if the meats werent enough to chew on at this time, more waiters flooded our table with a selection of side dishes like mashed potatoes, fried plantains (bananas) and broccoli.  They have more sides like beans, rice and fried Yucca should you want them as well.  I cant recommend the fried Yucca enough as it was a perfect compliment to the meat.  Think of it as a less starchy, slightly sweeter steak french fry.   The total amount of meats that made it to our table was 16 and once you get through the whole roster they invite you to request any of them to come back out for more.  No mas for this guy...if I didnt have gout before, Im sure my body was one more bite away from developing it!  While there is a desert menu, I couldnt even think about it.  All I wanted to do was get home and throw on some elastic pants.  While I may have been in pain, it was a good pain and worth the effort.  The staff at VIa Brasil is top notch and took time to explain every dish for us and the preparation.  I found the prices to be reasonable for the Brazilian Churascarrian dining experience and especially for the quality.  Its essentially 40 bucks a person for the full shabangabang.  I cant wait to get back and explore their wine menu next time (nephew is under 21 so we decided to go the soda route) and I hear they have live music on the weekends!  It may take 2 months to digest all the food and once it is, you can definitely bet  I'll be back.  As a bonus:  its so refreshing to have a restaurant of this quality in the neighborhood without having to deal with a casino/resort!",

    "text": "This place was much better than Texas de Brazil and not to mention a little cheaper.  The BF said that all the meats were really good and not as tough as TDB's meats.  The salad bar had a little less selection in the vegetable area, but there was beef carpaccio (better than Brio's apparently), mussels, and other seafood selections not offered at TDB.  The passed meats included picanha, rib eye, flank steak, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, bacon wrapped turkey, chicken, baby back pork ribs, beef ribs, salmon, and Brazilian sausage (I couldn't stop laughing when the BF told the guy with the sausage how much he \"love[s] Brazilian sausage\").  The sides that the AYCE Rodizio dinner comes with are mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, cheese rolls, cinnamon sugar bananas (yum), and others upon request (just ask your waiter) all included in the set price.  The only thing that wasn't included was dessert.  Before coming I visited their website and signed up for their weekly newsletter and received an e-mail for 20% off  their Rodizio dinner for up to 4 people - awesome, now we can do a double date with our friends.  The service here was really good.  Our water glasses were always filled, and they asked (before we had to ask) if we would like more Coke - a very rare experience.  We were looking for the lamb so we asked the flank steak guy and literally 1 minute after he left, the lamb dude showed up - amazing.    Also they have a mini-Rodizio offering AYCE 5 meats (picanha, ribeye, lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon, and salmon) for only $18.95 (Available in the bar and patio area only).  Might go back to try this option... too bad they don't offer the Brazilian sausage.  haha",

    "text": "I've gone to this place a number of times now, and wow. Just wow. Unless you're a vegetarian, this place is amazing.  If you've never gone to a Brazilian steakhouse before, it's quite an experience. It's all you can eat and you are given a card that's green on one side and red on the other. If you want them to bring more, then green side up. If you're full or just want to take a break, red side up. Of the 18 different meats on the menu, almost all are carried around on what can best be described as mini swords. If the waiter sees your card is green side up, he/she will stop, slice you off as much as you want, and then make way for the next waiter. A few of the bigger items, like beef ribs and salmon, are brought around on a cart, but the same principles apply. The service style is called \"rodizio.\"  I've found that the skirt steak, top sirloin, and leg of lamb are the best, but it's entirely subjective. Most of the steaks have a similar seasoning, which has a slight salty taste, but everything is very good.   The best way to approach this massive intake is to focus on the meats first, then finish off with the salad bar, because let's be real here...you aren't going to get your money's worth if you do it the other way around. The salad bar is well stocked with dishes ranging from meat and seafood entrees to various veggies to appetizer-ish items. They usually have calamari salad and hearts of palm, so I'm always satisfied.   The drinks at this place are top notch too. There is a respectable wine selection and an assortment of Brazilian drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The two worth mentioning are the guarana and caipirinha. The first is a soda that tastes like Red Bull, and the second is the national drink of Brazil. I was expecting the second to be more of a, well...drink, but it turns out it's just straight liquor with a splash of lime juice and sugar. It's got a really good flavor, however, it'll definitely wake you up if you're aren't expecting something so strong.   The dessert cart merits a look before you decide to call it a night. I'm sort of a tiramisu pig, and theirs is worth trying. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but I also have impossibly high standards in this field. Theirs is, without a doubt, more than good enough to warrant ordering again. They have creme brulee, cakes, mousses, and a few others too. Come to think of it, their desserts are pretty much what you would expect at an Italian restaurant.   I would rate this place as one of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas, but I can't really go there too often since it's a little cost-prohibitive. Dinner for two with drinks and dessert will run you about $120 after tax and tip. That said, they do offer some specials that will appeal to more budget-conscious diners. Mon-Thurs from 5-7, they have a limited (meaning only 5 meats without the salad bar) all you can eat special for $18.95 per person, served in the bar area and patio only. They offer the same special on Sat and Sun from noon to 5:00 as well, so you don't really have an excuse not to try this place.    Make sure Via Brasil is on your radar for your next special occasion. You won't be disappointed.",

I was not expecting the staff to be Brazilian but I would say 75% of the people we interacted with were.

The quality of meat was just OK, and the taste was not too flavorful as I would have imagined it to be.   The service though was good.  They were courteous, and quick to serve the meat.  But, it took an hour and a half before any salmon came out.  The skirt steak was too thick, and I like it better a little crispy on the outside.  The ribs were good, but the top sirloin was kind of flavor-less.  The bacon wrapped turkey and bacon wrapped tenderloin was good of course because anything wrapped in bacon is good. LOL.  I had to use the typical A1 steak house with a little bit of tabasco to add some flavor and spice.  The salad bar was just OK too.  I enjoyed the portobello mushrooms, and seafood.  But other than that, the salad bar was just OK.    Overall experiences was just OK.  Fancy place, romantic atmosphere, great two person band, but the food did not impress me much.    The cappacino and tiramisu helped to replace the flavorless-ness of the food.    Unfortunately, I cannot really recommend this place.  Sorry.",

My Fiance likes her meat rear so we asked the server if they could do that and within a few minutes we had rear meat being cut infront of us. the atmosphere was amazing, adults and kids dancing infront of the DJ and party favors everywhere. I look forward to our next visit. Know body takes better care of us then Via Brasil!",

The staff was very supportive and encouraging to all of us. The food was delicious! I do think their buffet bar can add some more variety, but in a Brasil restaurant it's all about the different meats they send your way anyway. The best thing I took away from the experience was the excellent service and delicious food. I would recommend this place to anyone who's planning their wedding reception.",

    "text": "So damn good! Better than any buffet we ever had! It's about 15 min drive from Vegas but trust me, it's worth the drive!  Pretty much everything here is good. My favs were the turkey wrapped in bacon and the filet wrapped in bacon. There's 16 different things that they bring around. I got to try 14 out of the 16. Didn't get a chance to taste the chicken breast and the salmon. But trust me, our stomachs weren't missing the last 2 items. It was pretty much at max capacity about 15 minutes BEFORE we stopped eating!  You also have access to a salad bar that includes items with shrimp and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was a bit watery to my liking, but I can't complain since it's free! At the beginning of your meal, you also get bread cheese balls (YUM!) and brocolli and mashed potatoes. I would recommend eating only 1 cheeseball and skipping the veggies. You will thank me for it later when your stomach is maxed out and you've only tried 10 of the 16 meats :)  Did I mention that they have IMPECABBLE service? Everyone from the sommelier, the water boy, the waiters, and the roving meat holders were incredibly attentive and accomodating. And it's not like we were high rollers either. We were your regular run of the mill folks. But they treated us just like we were VIPs.  We will be making a visit out here on every single Vegas trip!!!",

The deal is like this, for one person it's about $43.00, so for me and my husband was about $86 for all the meat that we can fit in our belly.   We decided to order some drinks - I had a Passion Fruit Brazilian drink and my hubby a Remy Martin on the rocks. Those alone were $36 so if you don't want to get a hefty bill, order water! Definitely recommend it to any of my friends",

Too me it's almost the evidence I would need to change my belief and become part of the faithful.  The salad bar is excellent. The meats seasoned and cooked perfectly. The deserts look magnificent but sadly I was too full to have one.  My father ordered a steak sanwhich which was too much for him and he took half of it home.   Most importantly is the food, service, quality to price ratio and again Via hits the mark. I don't have any reason to rate this place lower than five stars so I won't. Top marks. Worth it!",

However, the salad bar leaves a lot to be desired.  They also don't have very many choices of beef cuts.  Being that it's steakhouse, I was expecting more than what was offered. So basically, the menu is quite limited in my opinion.  I honestly don't see myself going back on my own dime - it's too pricey of a place to casually waltz in just to satisfy a craving.  Overall, I remain team Texas de Brazil.",

They also offer omelets but that too I could have made better myself.  Salad bar was ok but no grilled eggplant and lobster bisque was like water.  It took forever to get our sides and cheese bread so I had to ask twice.  Meats were good but they shave off so little each time.  This was our 2nd time--I doubt we will return because it just isn't worth it.  I've tried Fogo de chao, pampas and Texas de brazil and TDB still wins because of the quality of meats and the better salad bar and lobster bisque.  Brunch was $24.99 and drinks are not included....",

    "text": "OMFG.. this place was a meat-fest!! I find myself not knowing where to start as I did when I sat down to start eating!   First off, it is a pretty fancy restaurant. My boyfriend made reservations for his mom's birthday and he told us that we needed to dress \"smart casual\" which was on the website or something. We were all like.. \"wtf is smart casual?\". Anyway, it definitely isn't a jeans and t-shirt type of restaurant. The atmosphere is very nice and they have some nice waterfall type thing. It wasn't too busy for a Saturday night but it the live jazz music really set the mood (versus the corny christmas music they played while the two musicians took a break I'm guessing).  I started off at the salad bar which isn't only limited to \"salad\". They had rice pilaf, beans, beef carpaccio, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, ravioli, risotto, and more. Everything was delicious and I was quite excited to try the beef carpaccio since I have never before. Really good and the saltiness of the parmesan cheese made it more palatable, in my opinion. (I love raw fish but always iffy when it comes to raw meat)  The waiters come around with their sticks of meat. My favorite was the sirloin.. omg.. it was soooo juicy and delicious. The flank was tough, dry and had no flavor. The prime rib was excellent. I have never tried lamb before and boy, that was goooood. I didn't get the chicken but I did try the bacon wrapped turkey which was ah, okay. Nothing special. But boy, that sirloin was winnahhhs! I'll be dreaming about that for a long time!  For dessert we got passion fruit mousse (too rich and sweet for me), creme brule, and flan. I am not a dessert person whatsoever.. so to me.. it was all too rich and sweet.   Service is beyond excellent. They are very polite and quick! Always a \"your welcome\" when saying thank you. We asked one of the guys (manager, I'm guessing -- he was wearing a suit) for the fish since we hadn't seen it yet, and not even one minute later, the salmon came around. The bf's sister asked for the dessert menu and again, the desert cart came around within just a few seconds!   Overall, their food is awesome and their service is even more awesome. Since the bf and I are poor college students, we can't afford to eat here too often.. but I'm glad that we decided to take his mom here.. the experience was definitely worth the money!",

There were 8 people in my party for happy hour.   I have been to this restaurant several times for Happy Hour in the 3 years I have lived in Las Vegas.  They have recently advertised their restaurant quite aggressively.  I will not (nor will the other people in my group) be going back again.  After sitting there for almost an hour and repeatedly asking waiter for a drink (even water would have been nice), we finally got our drinks.  I ordered a Corona with lime and was brought a Stella something or other...not what I ordered.  Others ordered wine and were served something  other than what they ordered. The food orders were all mixed up. Some people got their food right away and were finished eating before others even received their food. Then when we tried to pay our tabs and leave, the waiter brought the wrong credit card to the person asking for hers (scary!)  We asked for the manager who took 30 minutes to come to the table.  We were trying to explain our frustration, but she was looking over our heads at the table next to ours because they were complaining to the waiter as well.  She never once tried to make things right.  I asked for my credit card and my check.  She said she had to run my credit card first.  I told her I never I intended to use my credit card for payment, that I was paying cash, and that the waiter was holding my credit card \"hostage\".  All in all, it was a terrible experience and neither I nor my friends will be back to this restaurant.",

Also, the facility is beautiful but the service is \"okay\" overall everyone is very nice but I was very disappointed the last time I was there. On 11/7/14 (Friday night) I made reservations for my a birthday dinner for my boyfriend and his father... I called the day before making the reservation. Lets just say it was a process. I was put on hold for a moment after letting them know I needed to make a reservation, all fine and dandy right? A moment later a woman got on the phone with a very thick accent. As I was giving my information she could hardly understand what I was saying. I had to spell out every word. She started to get frustrated and I could tell so I asked if there was someone else I could talk to, she put me on hold without saying anything and another woman got on the phone. This lady spoke better English and the process sped up. Near the end of the conversation I let the second lady know that it was going to be a birthday celebration and specifically gave her the names of the two men.  We arrived there early so decided to have a seat at the bar before dinner. The bartender was very nice and told the boys happy birthday after I had mentioned it. (2nd person I told)  Then we went to our table and the dinner was very good as usual. After dinner they bring around a display of desserts that you can choose from. I thought maybe you have to pick a dessert then they put in a candle or something. I then loudly announced \"birthday boys what would you like\" as the waiter was standing next to our table. I casually said maybe some cheesecake? The waiter left & we were waiting for the celebration, instead the waiter brought the check which in total we spent over $300 and told us to have a good night... As you can see there was no birthday celebration, candle, song, or anything of that nature.. VERY DISSAPOINTING. When we were walking out my boyfriends mother and I approached the front desk person and let them know that we did not receive any birthday dedication and we were sadly disappointed seeing how I specifically made the reservations for this occasion and not to mention spend over 300 dollars!!  She then said \"im sorry, next time\"........ Next time?? We did not make a scene or call the manager but I know now not to use this place for celebration. The customer service overall was rough and I thought for a higher end steakhouse we would get some type of acknowledgement.",

I walked into our house and walked straight into the bedroom (get your head out of the gutter!) where I had to take a nap until 8:00pm.  When I  woke up, I wondered \"what the hell happened?\"  Meat Feast is what happened.  Yes, that is a True story.  Yes, as someone referred to it below as a \"food parade\" is True.  Did I love it?  Absolutely.  We had a group of 8 people.  I did not know what to expect about going there.  But the waiter explained everything to us. They have a salad bar thing- salad, pasta, etc. so I went over there and got a few things.    And then the meat came.    It started at a slow pace and quickly picked up to where I had like 10 pieces of meat on my plate, but didn't want to pass up the meat guy when he came to the table.  Eventually, I had to turn my thing over so they didn't offer me any more meat.   And it was damn good meat.  I say meat, because I had so many different types, its very hard to remember all of it.  We have some friends that are Asian and from Hawaii and they asked about chicken hearts.  Within 10 minutes, the meat guy came to our table with chicken hearts.  (not something I would ever try again)  But how accommodating!    Everyone was really nice and willing to answer any questions!  Recommendation: wear stretchy pants- you'll need it.  It's been a year since I have been there... I think it might be time to go back!",

So the owner called undercover mystery diners to find out.  I could not hold my curiosity and visited the restaurant with my wife for dinner. This is an upscale Brazilian steak house where they bring in various types of meats to your table and you serve the side orders from a buffet like table.  Environment is trendy, upscale, food pretty good.  You can get different cuts of beef, pork, chicken, sausages and even lamb.  You have full bar and service is good. I recommend you get reservation during weekends but wait time is not bad either.  Price is typical at par with other Brazilian steak house not wickedly expensive and not cheap either.

If you like you're meat rare, VIA If you're really into the awesome salad bar, Texas If you love lambchops, Texas, VIA does NOT have lambchops...be forewarned  If you don't want to wait at least 15-30 min every-time you go, VIA  Its a tough choice but if i HAD to chose one, I'd have to go with Texas, a few more selections at the salad bar and Lamb chops trumps all for me",

    "text": "After multiple weeks of craving a churrascaria or..rodizio....we flip-flopped between Texas de, which was a twenty minute drive, with a birthday coupon for $25 off...and the five minute drive to Via....we made same-day resos on OpenTable at Via for 3 @ 7:15pm on Friday night.  Hello beautiful unabashed protein fix!! We were sat next to a wall and asked to be moved to a different table. They easily honored our request, even the Hostess helped us move our drinks to a center situated table.  We all ordered the Sterling level.  The cheesy rolls, pao de queijo ... ehh, I have certainly had much better. They were a bit too gummy and seriously under baked inside. The salad bar, again...ehh. Much to be desired. As a ranch dressing fiend, it did taste housemade which was nice. But many items from the salad bar were overly and unnecessarily salty, imo. The beef carpaccio has two dabs of green olive puree, not sure why. I was told the lobster bisque was adequate, not great.  Service -- really was very good. All of the servers, runners and the meat skewer guys were helpful, informative and stopped to check on us the entire evening in a not-so intrusive way.  Looking at their menu posted online, we pretty much had every option at some point in the evening. Including leg of lamb -decent enough, baby lamb chops, sooo cute, but overcooked. Brazilian pork was moist if you asked not for the crispy part, melted mozz - all of the good parts of a pizza. Sides were okay, mashed potatoes, asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, fried bananas. The spinach was not completely wilted, perhaps that was a cost savings procedure?  We all opted for dessert and espressos and cappuccino...passion fruit mousse - not my thing, but not terrible. Flan, no caramelized sugar sauce, but again not terrible. Chocolate mousse....slightly disappointing. It is one of my few dessert weaknesses...almost could not taste the pudding that was definitely whipped in. In all, disappointed especially because of the proximity. Brunch or happy hour seem to have better reviews, perhaps would have been a better visit. :-/",

    "text": "Hmm. I'm conflicted. I likened this restaurant to Texas de Brazil in my head... We went on a Sunday afternoon and there was one other table occupied. The restaurant is clean and the hostess and waiter, both very nice. We started with the salad bar and the selections were \"okay\". Nothing spectacular, except the asparagus risotto- that was tasty. My picky toddler loved the lobster bisque (she ate free). The meats started coming and maybe because it wasn't so busy it almost seemed like they were trying to get rid of the meat. As for the taste, some were nice while others were tasteless, too salty or very over/under cooked. Maybe we should've spoken up, but at that point- it didn't really matter. For the equivalent price of other establishments that provide the same service, I expected more. There was nothing really wrong... It was just like visiting Olive Garden as opposed to a truly authentic Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "It's sad but I have to knock off a couple of stars for Via Brasil.  First, they would not take my groupon, claiming that the Sunday before Valentine's Day was a holiday.  If they are going to have liberal interpretations of holidays, they need to put the exact dates on the groupon.  It's not like the groupon lasts forever, like <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificates do.  Just figure out the dates for the period that the groupon is valid and put them on there.  Voila, problem solved.  In addition, they had the server give us the bad news.  The manager needs to step up and deal with those things, not leave it to the poor server.  I contacted Groupon and, fortunately, they gave me my money back.  Groupon is so nice about stuff like that.  Second, the service this time was slow and strange.  It took a while for our server to notice that we were out of drinks.  Meanwhile, the same guy kept coming by over and over and over again with lamb chops even though we had refused over and over and over again.  He was seriously acting like a zombie.  A zombie with lamb chops on a very sharp metal stick.  Third, at the end of this month they are adding an all-you-can-eat pasta option for $22.95.  I think this automatically makes this place less classy.  It also shows me that they are getting a little greedy because the food cost for pasta is so low.  It's going to be like a pricey Olive Garden with people running around with sharp metal sticks with meat on them.  Plus, if the servers can't handle drinks consistently, I'm not sure they can handle AYCE pasta.  Unless the pasta comes on sticks.  :)   On the positive side, the salmon, which is served from a cart, was excellent.  Nicely cooked with a tasty mango sauce.  The man serving the salmon was really enthusiastic and nice.  He even remembered when he came back a second time that we had already had the salmon and appropriately asked if we'd like some more.  Also, the woman operating the dessert cart was super nice and helpful.  I'm bummed that I had a mediocre experience after so many good ones.  Via Brasil, I think we need some time apart to work things out.  Hopefully time heals all wounds.",

I was dressed down because I eat better when I feel more relaxed.  I made it a point to eat everything on the menu and I told our host/server that.  Certain items on the menu have to be requested.  The salmon and passion fruit sauce was so good.  I enjoyed every piece of yummy protein and they still have the best salad bar evaarrrr.  I really enjoyed the prime rib also w/a side of horseradish.  The cheeseball bread cleared my taste buds/pallets each time.    After that, we saved room for dessert and they brought the cart around.  I got a passion fruit mousse and my friend got creme brulee.  After paying for the meal and leaving a $30 tip we stayed and caught up a lil bit longer.  I saw the salmon cart go around and had to get another piece.  =]  Good stuff good stuff, haven't been here in over a year and I believe the price may have jumped.  The restaurant was clean and spacious but somehow feels it could still improve.  I don't know how but I'm still waiting for it.  De-Lish!",

Decided to try Via Brasil and head for a food coma early in the week. So glad we did. After debating going into the bar for the happy hour we both decided to eat in the restaurant instead. Food coma notwithstanding I am so glad we did.  The food was perfect and nicely timed, we never felt rushed and the staff was some of the best I have ever seen. I like rare meat ( ok stop making faces!) Our waiter figured that out pretty fast and started bringing me the nicest meat on a stick to taste ;)   My absolute favorite was the flank steak! One little snafu misunderstanding about the Yelp check in if it was for a desert each or only one per table (how we even decided to try desert after all that deliciousness!) and they took both off the ticket.  Absolute great place and will definitely find another reason to go there again!",

Extremely helpful if it is your first time at a Brazilian steakhouse.   Now, the food: everything in the salad bar was delicious. The salads, the mushrooms, the pasta, the soup; excellent. Along with Fogo de chao, this salad bar is quite possibly the best in town. The meat...now, I am not a connoisseur of steak, but I could tell a difference in not only quality of the meat, but also the taste from other Brazilian steakhouses. The overall quality of the meat seemed lower than at other places; I felt it to be quite rough, even though I asked for medium cooked slices. By comparison, fogo, and even Fleming's, was very tender. It was okay at best in terms of quality. In terms of taste, I found the ribeye (sniffle) to be salty! The RIBEYE! I literally had to spit it out, it was that bad. The lamb was salty as well and it irritated me. The New York strip steak and filet mignon were dry...VERY dry. This saddened me even further :(  However, the top sirloin was amazing, I could eat that all day...  All in all, via is a good place to eat... But for the price, I don't think it's worth it; for $50+, fogo is the better choice.",

Let me remind you, it was a party of 4 with drinks totaling more than $250 plus tip.  No effort was made to apologize for not having the menu items in stock. Now, if they were charging $20 a plate, they would have got 5 stars.  But for $50 a plate, I expect better service. I do understand that things go wrong, however, no effort was ever made to correct it.  We had no interactions with the manager whatsoever.  Shrimp was never served until begged for.",

    "text": "A great place for Happy Hour!  Its crowded enough that there isnt really any bar stool available or tables but not busy enough that there were people standing around.  Happy Hour is daily from 5pm-8pm in the bar and patio area.    FOOD:  Caipirinha's (Kiwi and Strawberry) $5 each - their kiwi flavored sugar can liquor is so good!  The Caipirinha is Brazil's famous drink and I love it!! Its sweet and super strong.  I really liked the two separate flavors and it didn't hide the kick that you get lol My only problem I had with the Strawberry was that I would have loved if they strained the strawberry bits out.  Its kind of hard to drink when every two seconds I have to clear the straw.    Chicken Tenders $5 - The chicken tenders are tender and moist ^_^ they make good tenders lol And they come with a side of Yucca Fries which I love.  I am a great lover of french fries and every time I have Yucca fries, I wonder how come other restaurants cant make them too!  Brazilian Fish and Chips $4.50 - The fish was extremely moist and flakes really easily which is a good thing.  My only issue with this is that it has a fishy taste to it which makes me wonder how fresh it is.   Brushetta $3.50 - You get four piece of brushetta topped with feta, tomato, and top with lemon dressing.  Its pretty good and the size of each brushetta is pretty large when most restaurant serve you something pretty small.  The only thing that could make this really good was that they need to toast the bread.  I love bread, I love bread that i just eat straight up with their crunch exterior and super soft chew interior... their brushetta was that but its not very stable when you're trying to lift it up to take a big bite when the lemon dressing is soaking through.    Sausage & Yucca $5 - Yucca fries are the bomb! When we place this order, i thought were were going to get these chubby little sausages (no idea why i thought that lol) but what we got instead small little sausage slices (about size of nickels) that were sauteed crispy.  The flavor was good but was surprise that the form they came in.  Whats really good is if you take the slice sausages from this place and put them on the brushetta lol  SERVICE: The staff are very attentive ^_^ Since there wasnt any cocktail tables or bar stool open, they had set up two of their patio table behind the bar (small corner hidden behind the waterfall bar).  I think because we sat in this corner, we got better service lol cause the waitresses had to always remember to stop by.   Anna, one of the owners and event planner, walks the restaurant and the bar area and checks on the guests as well.  She is actually the reason why my fiance and I booked our wedding dinner at their restaurant.    The table next to us (the only other patio one in our little corner lol) had 3 guests that got their food quite quick but was missing their Caesars Chicken Salad (which looked pretty good and the size was large which I must remember to try next time).  The waitress apologized for the delay as there was a mix up in the kitchen and brought the salad ASAP.  Anna came by and offered them complimentary dessert for their delay on their one order.  I thought that was pretty nice since the guests didnt really seem to mind and that Anna was so quick to hear about it.

Two servers tried to take care of me and were nice but still think the wait was ridiculous... now for the food: I ordered the Caesar salad, shrimp scampi and filet sliders during happy hour. The salad was good and huge. The scampi is nasty and dry. The sliders are good. Cooked to temp and seasoned well. My drink (limeade with rum) was good but too hot. Needed more ice. Overall I am unsure if I will return.",

Well I didn't get a call so I called them today and to my surprise I was told that they could not find my name in the system. On top of that they are all booked up for brunch so this is very disappointing since now I have to scramble the last minute to find another restaurant to celebrate a special day. I'm a loyal customer and have dined here many times before and but this is an epic failure. Dining/restaurant experience goes beyond food, it's a whole experience to include making sure reservations are properly handled. Needless to say the person I spoke over the phone didn't offer any other solution. A good friend of mine is huge Las Vegas food blogger and I will be submitting a review for his consideration to publish an article online.",

They charged us $12 per person for entry because they had a brizilian festival in the parking lot, but when you sit in the resturant you can't see the show, and they have a band inside singing conflicting with the festival music outside for salsa dancing. It's was so noisy and uncomfortable. And they have a no \"re-entry policy\".  The salad bar is ok. The meat is not that good. They didnt have filet mignon or lamb althought its on the menu. It's the one of the worst resturants I have been to.  I don't write negative reviews, but I wouldn't want anyone to have this bad experience.",

Anytime I've beenn to Fogo their Fejuada was all beans and really sparse on the meat.  At Via it was full of sausage and pork...delicious. The meats on the Rodizio were perfectly seasoned and just kept coming.  The entire family had the meat sweats by the end of the meal All in all this is now my #1 Brazilian steakhouse.  Why it took me so long to try I can't explain.  I will definitely be back.",

If you are going here just for the meats, then I highly recommend of course. Their pork, bacon wrapped turkey, sirloin, and prime rib are all delicious. For Easter, the salad bar and dessert section was disappointing. There were only 2 dessert options which neither tasted very good and the salad bar was small and minimal choices. For $36/ person it is worth it for brunch if you are eating a lot of meat, otherwise don't expect to have a good choice of sides.",

Please visit McDonalds, Taco Bell and other fast foods if this is too expensive for you\"  It took me a minute to figure out what restaurant he was referring to, but when I found 20 photos for Via Brasil, I figured it out  Congratulations, guys, I will never return to your restaurant and will make sure nobody I ever talk to does either.

    "text": "It was like night and day from coming here twice. The first time it was just my husband and I, the food and service were amazing. We came on a weekday when they first opened for the night. The meats were delicious, the salad bar was completely stocked and our server and his helper were great. He answered all of our questions, as I was also inquiring about the king crab legs for my kids; whom we wanted to bring at a later time. Our sides and sauces came out as ordered and they both would pop in from time to time to check in and see how we were doing and make small talk.  Fast forward to the second time coming here. What a let down to say the very least! We came on a weekend, had reservations for 8:30 and brought our kids and daughter in law (a party of 6) after totally talking this place up. I was surprised to see that it was a ghost town for being the weekend. No problem tho. I figured we would just get exceptional service because they weren't busy at all...wrong!  First we got bum rushed the minute we sat down with like 3 waiters (or 1 and his 2 helpers?) the vibe we got right off the bat from them was, hurry up an order, eat, and get out. They were not friendly at all. In fact, the main waiter acted like he was in a rush, was super busy or was trying to get off early. We all ordered the sterling with 3 orders of the king crab legs and headed off to the salad bar...Which by the way was half empty, like they didn't bother to restock it. I thought paying these kinds of prices only to have the salad bar be pretty much empty?! Get back to the table and literally 4 meat guys are already standing by our table about to bum rush us like our servers did. None of them were friendly at all either. The meat this time, had no flavor or was super salty. We ordered sides and sauces and did not receive some of them. The only drinks they refilled was our waters, didn't bother to refill our sodas or tea (nor did they even ask if we wanted it refilled). The kicker, was when our 3 orders of \"supposed\" king crab legs came out. It was a complete joke! It was crab alright...but NOT king crab legs. They were the skinniest legs and smallest portions I've ever seen. When we questioned our waiter about it, he bought the manager over and even he looked embarrassed. Of course he wasn't going to say anything bad. He just stated, that's how they are and left. Knowing we were unhappy our servers attitudes got worse and they started rushing us even more. Like they wanted us to stop eating, pay and leave. By this time, that's exactly what we wanted to do. The food nor service was good at all. One of the servers got cocky and said, is there anything else or are you guys done? (While rolling his eyes at us) I told him, no that's it...but it would've been nice to get the sauces and sides that we asked you for. He straight turned around and left. When he came back, he plopped the check down on our table and put the sauce and side dish right in front of me and said here you go. Just like that, I couldn't believe it! Manager ended up coming back around, took our check and took off 2 of the orders of crab legs, which we thought was nice and reasonable. About to sign the check and cocky waiter is literally standing over me and mean mugging me. Word of advice, as a waiter, never ever stand over the person signing the check while giving them an attitude (especially after screwing with them), because you will more than likely get nothing for a tip! Funny thing is, we were still gonna tip too. Just not our normal 20+% but something. After that stunt...pshht forget it...He got nothing!  Needless to say, we won't be back here again. Paying these kinds of prices, you expect to be treated decent, the food to be phenomenal, and to receive what you ordered. We got none of that our second time around unfortunately.",

I've been to other Brazilian joints and it's been good but the staff setting and the salad bar were above the others.  A great selection of wines are displayed front and center. I don't have a great knowledge of wines but it was from the ceiling to the floor. We had a fantastic table just in front of the chefs skewering all the fresh cuts. And Fidel being well knowledgeable made many suggestions and took care of our 17 person party. Some of our party was getting missed on meats and within two minutes they had a selection of all the fine meats. Great night. Bathrooms clean everything clean and this is the spot if you want to feel local and exotic. Great job guys!!!!",

From walking in and being immediately greeted, prompt drink orders, etc.   I was impressed that the manager continued to circle and make sure that we got to try everything we wanted. She made sure to send servers over if there was anything we wanted to try.   We hit the salad bar first. I wasn't really impressed. I probably would not just do the salad bar, personally I don't think you can compare their salad bar to Texas De Brazil. Not nearly as many options and the food felt kind of picked over and lackluster.   The meat was great. Well seasoned and delicious. I loved the cooked mozzarella! For dessert we shared three kinds. An incorrect dessert was sent, but the server did take it back and bring out the correct one. The creme brulee was just ok, the crust wasn't fired enough. The panacotta was delicious! The donuts were ok.  Overall, we had a nice time. I would definitely try back, but would probably skip the salad bar and dessert.",

    "text": "Superb service and mouthwatering choice meats at Via Brasil Steakhouse! I have been here several times. The restaurant is always clean and beautifully adorned with plants. The bar is located near windows with a great view. They have tables that are privately located for special occasions or centrally located near others and the cold bar. The cold bar is kept fresh and immaculate. The presentation is artistic - the chef's definitely take pride in their work!  I absolutely love their daily gazpacho. It is usually served in a small shot glass as a sweet sampling as they are generally made with a fresh seasonal fruit like cantaloupe or watermelon. I generally ask for a teacup to be sent to me tableside, so I can enjoy a bit more without taking five or more shot glasses. The cold bar has a hot section as well where they serve some seafood pastas and seafood soups. Their hot soups are very tasty. I don't partake in the pasta dishes since I am there for choice meats.   I love the system typical of all local Brazilian restaurants that allows servers to know when you are ready for more meat. A circular color-coded yes/no card indicates when food should be offered or when servers should bypass the table. This allows the guest time to eat some of what they have before going back for more or from being bothered when full or not ready. It also allows the service to flow throughout the restaurant as serving staff carries choice meats that are hot and sometimes heavy.  The choice meats are broken into two categories of prices. There is something close to six select meats on the higher priced selection than the lower one. The price difference is $10.00, and it is worth the experience. Prior to service of meats, you can select from sauces and sides you'll want with your meal, and these are unlimited. I usually order sauteed mushrooms and the plantains. These are great choices.  I love the lamb chops, salmon, shrimp, and filet. They are my favorites! My favorites require more of the server's attention because most of these are not usually items that just make the rounds randomly. The lamb is cooked to order, so when you are ready, they will make it. The salmon is also typically not out often because it gets cold quick and is served on a wooden fire plate for flavor with a sweet sauce that makes it like a finishing selection to lead into dessert. I usually get the salmon last for that reason. The shrimp come out on a sizzling hot plate. The filet is well... a well seasoned choice meat. Although it is not meat, one item that is served is fresh hot mozzarella! I can be absolutely full and have a least two of these! This is a must try!   What stands out among the other Brazilian restaurants in town are the service standards. The restaurant expectation is that any guest that gets up from his/her seat should come back to a folded napkin and their seat pushed back in if left out. I love the concept of dining and being treated like a valued guest. I wish more restaurants invested time in winning my patronage. Additionally, there is a managerially presents that is not obtrusive to guests. They use hand signals and eye contact to keep watch on staff and draw attention to details. This is excellent training because when a guest motions, the servers are more observant. I have dined in restaurants were eye contact and body language was ignored due to ignorant waiting staff, foreign customs, or poor training. This prompts guests to get out of their seat or call out in a restaurant - tacky.  My favorite server is Fidel. I usually ask for him when I visit. Although all the servers in this restaurant work seamlessly together, Fidel stands out among the rest. When I ask for something like my lamb chops, he puts that order in and checks back with me as to when I can expect them. When I am done, he asks if I want more. When I tell him I am ready for my Salmon, he goes to the kitchen for that as well. He makes sure my water is never less than half-full, he pushes and pulls my chair out when I get up or sit down, and he never seems to act as though he is rushed or bothered. He never makes me feel like I am eating the entire restaurant out of their lamb chops or shrimp. He truly makes me feel like I am his only guest.   Definitely come to this restaurant hungry! Five-stars well deserved.",

    "text": "Absolutely phenomenal. First time eating here but I've heard so much about it. After eating tonight, I booked two more reservations with this place for this month. It's that good. The staff is incredible and take care of your food cravings.  ASK FOR THE TOP SIRLOIN. It's amazing and tastes even better when you add the fried mozzarella on top.  All of the meats taste good and the buffet station is great and all, but don't get stuffed there cause the meat is all you can eat. After eating so much, they bring a few desserts for you to choose from. The creme brulee is to die for, seriously. I promise if you go here, you'll never want to eat at another fancy steakhouse again because for the price, you'll get a single filet somewhere else. Remember to take it slow.",

    "text": "We came here a few weeks ago. Our experience was sub par at best. We noticed several tables around us unhappy and voicing their concerns to management as well. The problems we encountered were as follows: 1) quality of the meats was not very good 2) they offer a larger menu for an up charge but then take the menu away and don't explain you need to ask for the expanded choices by memory 3) the sides for the table are gross 4) the meat takes so long to get to your table that you become full before you get your money's worth 5) you have to ask repeatedly to get your sides or special meats from the up charge and then they come cold to the table by the time they make it  In comparing this place to Texas de Brazil- go to TDB over this place and don't give it a second thought. Very disappointed with my experience at Via.",

On top of that, I recieved a coupon to use for a future visit. Since I had friends coming in to town I thought what better time than brunch today. Now I've read this coupon several times and in no part of it, did state it must be used at a certain time of day or hour. At bill time, I present the coupon to our very \"courteous\" server who advised me that I could only use it for dinner. I asked her why since nowhere  on it did it say \"Not valid for brunch\" anywhere and after several nonsequter comments I asked for her manager who also said, unyieldinging \"No\". Now at this point, I would of been fine with even $5 off under the circumstances but I just got another rude end and in front of my guests no less. Needless to say.. I will never be back.",

We've gone to Fogo De Chao before and had always enjoyed the Brazilian steakhouse concept but the last time we had gone, we had a less than desirable experience. So we decided try Via out since we live around the corner and found a good deal on living social.   Our server Bre was wonderful. She was funny and attentive. She let us know about the brunch that host on Saturday and Sunday, which we are absolutely coming back to try! The food was impeccable with great service to match!",

    "text": "I am one of the very first clients of Via Brazil, in fact, I have bought a house in the area exclusively so I could have access to a authentic Brazilian barbecue restaurant. Of course that was not the only reason for me to buy that house, but it was a True consideration.   At Via Brasil, you will find a classic luxury environment with tons of meat, salads, desserts and cocktails. I have some tips for you if it's your first time at Via Brazil. They offer the \"all you can est deal\" called \"rodizio\" in Brazilian Portuguese, which is the best deal.   Via Brazil always throws big parties and play sports on a 120\" screen. Dining at Via Brazil is an incredible experience, always. I really enjoy how the staff and management takes care of you, and honestly this is one of their strongest points. The food at Via Brazil is incredibly tasty, it not only tastes good, but it also looks good! I love taking pictures at their dishes and sharing it on Instagram :) you can follow me on Instagram:  \"vegaslifefood\".  I'm not here to judge anyone, I'm here to state the facts, and the facts. At Via Brazil, they work really hard to serve you with the best quality food and customer service. What's better than listening to some Brazilian MPB songs while eating authentic fresh Brazilian food, while drinking an incredibly tasty caipirinha? The music, the food, the service, the parties, everything comes together so well, I love dining there!  Via Brazil also takes really care of their locals, remember when I said that I purchased a home near by the restaurant because I liked it so much? That was a True statement, and if you don't like something on the menu, or if they are too busy to give you enough attention, make sure to tell the management! They will take care of you! Trust me, I'm an engineer ;)  Ok, so you have convinced me that they serve fresh yummy food and that they have good customer service, but what should I order? You must have:  - Caipirinha (Brazil's national drink) - Picanha (cap sirloin steak) - Fraudinha (flank steak) - Salgadinhos (surprise for you :)  Dessert - Flan - fried banana (included on your all you can est rodizio deal)  Expresso,  Bed.",

    "text": "Best AYCE Brazilian BBQ in town   I've been to multiple Brazilian BBQ joints including the Texas and Fogo, and this place was the best by far.   When you're paying these prices, you want quality. They deliver on the quality but they also delivery on variety and flavor.   Pro-tip: If you are a medium-well or well-done dude, get it medium. Trust the Process. You'll be much happier embracing the pink than chasing the brown (phrasing, boom). But Seriously, using the word \"well\" is something you do at your own risk here, you'll have a better experience if you trust their medium to be done enough. It's certainly tasty enough.   So they have a premium menu that really sets them apart. I forgot the name of it, but baby back ribs, ribeye, shrimp, and salmon, make it well worth the price, and everything I tried was delicious, well worth the price in addition to all the other goodies you get from the main.    My table seemed to love the lobster bisque, but I almost recommend completely avoiding the salad bar aside from that. Just stick with the made-to-order sides. A lot of mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and spinach was consumed during our trip. Other memorable items from the standard menu were the Filet mignon and the sausages. I remember having lamb and tri tip etc. They weren't bad. They just didn't stick in my mind several days later.   One thing: They don't really have a hot sauce for people who love spicy food. The closest thing to it is those peppers at the salad bar. So if you're a heat lover like me, throw one in with your bite of whatever for the kick you crave.   Service was good too. Very responsive. Never made you feel bad for asking for more. Things might take some time to come out because they're going to try to bring it out fresh for you - unless a fresh batch is already circulating.   We reserved a table for our group, but I noticed plenty of empty spots when we arrived around 6:30 on a Friday night. Because this place isn't near the strip or directly inside a major shopping center, I think it's a bit easier to get a table.   Generally, I've been recommending this place to everybody following this last visit. I hope your experience is 5-star (at least 4 star) as well.   More Pro-tips: I'm not sure there are free refills on anything. Just something to keep in mind. And dessert isn't included with the meal, but after all that food, I didn't feel like throwing down dinero on a dessert. I believe a buddy got the cheesecake and was underwhelmed.",

We, normally, go to that \"other\" place on the southern end of the Strip, but the service there has been majorly lacking the past few years. So, we decided to try Via Brasil again (we hadn't been here in years).  Well, Via Brasil's service was OUTSTANDING! And, the meats (selection and quality) were awesome...perfectly cooked, hot, and delicious. Our server, Rampal(?) was totally on point...tending to our every request. It was churrascaria heaven!  I highly recommend Via Brasil and I look forward to our next visit.",

The salad bar had things for salad but also choices like apple pancakes, eggs, bacon, clams, asparagus soup, etc. The bacon was very crisp and the asparagus soup had a nice thick texture to it.  The staff is so polite and accommodating. The maitre d' was a man this time and I'm used to a woman but he still did a fine job. Sadly I have to admit this wasn't my finest moment as a yelper. The meat kept coming and I couldn't keep track of whats what but this applies to most of the meat... It was all juicy, it had a nice crust on it, and it melts in your mouth. Now I love all my beef medium rare to medium. It was a lot of prime cuts of meat. Would recommend 100% cause I'm always in meat heaven here.",

Did our Grub Hub driver swap our food out for something along the way?  No that was not the case instead we were treated to some of the worst cuts of beef ever, we could not cut through them.  One order of tri-tip was wasted and we forced down the remaining two orders out of sheer hunger, we waited 45 minutes for the food, and will pay for it as digestion is sure to be a task.  An utter disappointment.  When we called the restaurant the young lady wanted to know what was wrong and then put us on hold for about as long as we waited for our food.    They definitely had the grade A Brazilian flavor with the grade C beef and grade C+ service.  Follow Up: Received a call and they offered to make it right.  But it is not about money it is about quality, time and service.  Things happen and perhaps we were the unlucky recipients of a bad meal. It happens.  However I cannot give three stars and two and a half is not an option so I am bumping them one star for the courteous, if not delayed response and offer to do good.",

The meat served is definitely better than the salad bar but don't be fooled; the list of meats served on the menu is incorrect.   They rotate the same mediocre meats on skewers but if you want shrimp, lamb chops, or filet... good luck! Your table will be visited with offerings of sausage, sirloin streak, pork, and chicken. We specially asked for lamb chops and waited 15 minutes. Once they finally arrived they only had one small chop for each person. Shrimp also came out once after requesting it but we were each only given 2 small shrimps.  I did not dislike my experience but I also feel like I did not receive a meal worthy of the money we spent. I do not recommend this restaurant and I personally will not visit again.",

If you want a less sweet cocktail, try the lime caipirinha. My fav cocktail was the fortified sangria (it's spiked with brandy and rum)...mmmm",

I was told I would have to wait an hour from my reserved time. I'm sure the hour would have turned into ninety minutes. We left the restaurant and found another place to dine. To the owner of this place...it's amazing you treat people like cattle by over booking thereby ruining our dinner plans.

Most of the people I have talked to about Via Brasil said it was way better, so why not try it.  Salad bar: They had lobster bisque soup, white rice, salad, sauteed mushrooms, and yummy delicious items to choose from. (Beware: as tempting as it is don't go over board because you want to leave room in your tummy for some meat)  For all you meat lovers they have many different types of meats to eat. The Prime Rib and top sirloin was my favorite. Also, they do have Salmon, which I enjoyed. You also get to choose 3 sides to eat with your meat...we ordered the grilled asparagus, broccoli, and fried plantains.   I would totally recommend this place!

His fellow service people were just as attentive.   We've experience Brazilian restaurants like this in the past and the meats were on par if not better than other establishments.  The service we received from Fidel was far superior than previous experiences at other places. Every member served with a smile and gladly accommodated any special requests.

Yes they have a salad bar with a lot of nice items but vegetarians will never get full value out of this place.  With that said, I have been to other Brazilian places in town and this is probably the best.  It looks nice inside and the food quality is quite high.  The price, while \"high\" in a general sense, is pretty competitive within the Brazilian market.  So why not five stars?  To be sure my last visit was quite recent and quite good.  But, in the past, I have experienced some of the knocks others have noted.  Specifically, waiters that seem to walk right by my table while I sit there, sometimes for a long time, waiting for more meat.  Also - in the past I have also experienced a certain level of \"grief\" when trying to use a coupon that this place sent me!  If it's a problem, don't send it to me!    Hopefully these things have been corrected, I did not experience them on my most recent visit I am glad to say, and I probably will be back in time.  I also want to make a special note about the mother/father's day brunch:  Really good and also worth your consideration!",

When we arrived, the party was hopping! They had hors d'oeuvres set up, and the bar was packed. I asked a waiter if the setup was all for us, the party goers, and he said yes. So, we grabbed a plate and some snacks and found a table. I went waited in line for the bartender,  who had to be flagged down by no less than three people, since I'm apparently invisible, even in full Victorian garb. Once I finally got our drinks, I returned to our table only to find a bill for $58 - for a freaking salad bar! Sixty bucks for a salad? Are you kidding me? I had yet to take a single bite, so I called over a waiter and asked him what was going on. Same one that told us the hors d'oeuvres were part of the party, only now he acted like I was dumb. Told him no way in Hell was I paying $60 for a salad bar. Especially since I hadn't even found the salad, only the hors d'oeuvres for the party. He called over a manager, and he told me that they weren't for us. What? We asked first!! Bitchy waitress chimed in and said we were picking food off other's plates. Um...we sat down with a party of people who offered us hors d'oeuvres. WTF? Ended up telling them to take the plates, now it's principle. Rude bartenders who ignore you, waiters who lie, $60 gold-plated salads, and mean waitresses. Damn.",

We came in on Valentine's Day and were pleasantly surprised by the pretty and inviting ambiance (they had a live singer serenading guests) however, sadly, this was the most impressing part of our visit. We paid for the sterling menu, which consisted of supposedly, 21 meats. During our 2 hour visit, we tried about 8 meats. The gauchos continued to bring chicken, turkey and sausage to our table and we saw very little steak. The cheese bread was nothing special, which I guess worked out for us, because after 4 pieces of bread, our waitress just stopped bringing it altogether. The fried bananas were too hard and lacked the sweet, cinnamon flavors we are used to. Once we decided we've had enough, we asked for our check and we were not even offered dessert. For the price we paid, we were pretty bummed that we didn't just go to our usual (Texas De Brazil.) The flavors, variety, and service of this \"steakhouse\" just doesn't compare to Texas De Brazil.",

Service was great and the food was steady and delicious. The server was so friendly always offering refills for drinks when they were at 25% or less.   Where they lose 3 stars with me is the nondisclosure that refills were not included. Never have I been to a steakhouse that does not inform you that certain basic drinks do not come with refills. I spent enough for another person to come join us for dinner!. The proce was not the issue, the fact this eatablishment charges for refills shows me they are more jnterested in padding thier pockets and just being greedy. At least at Fogo de Chao, they will ask and inform you of the drink you have will be an additional charge. This was my children's first and last trip to this establishment. Fogo de Chao will be my place to go from now on and the place for our 45 person reunion, as well as any future groups gatherings. Its the little things that make a difference.",

    "text": "So it's Christmas. I HATE posting bad reviews, it takes a lot for me to post them. But this placed earned this one.   For the first time ever we decided to eat out as we didn't have any guests in town. We made dinner reservations for 7:15. We arrived at 7:00. The place was so packed people were crammed in every available space like a can of sardines. The hostess (a brunette) told us it would be about 15 minutes after our reservation as people were hanging out and they were clearing tables. Well we stood in the entry way with our 3 year old for over an hour. We watched person after person come in that had a reservation and they were all given the same exact line. There were two hostesses, I happened to hear the brunette hostess tell the blonde one the line to tell everyone. It went along the lines of \"we are waiting for people to leave but also clearing our empty tables. We will get you seated as soon as people clear out\" When the poor girl got asked literally every minute by a different person (not exaggerating) how long until they'd be seated or how many parties were in front of them, she nervously played with her tablet then delivered the line she was told to give. She clearly was under trained. I felt badly for her. And if her or her manger is reading this, you did great (hostess, NOT manager) and it's your manager that is to blame for putting you in that situation completely unprepared. Whatever you made tonight, wasn't enough. You couldn't have paid me enough to do your job. When I left I could see the tears in your eyes and I should have said more than Merry Christmas to you.   We waited over an hour for our table to seat myself, my husband and our toddler. A lovely man with his family waited an entire hour longer than us. Well until we walked away. As we were enjoying our food, I looked to the hostess stand and saw this poor man and his son still waiting for a table while an empty table sat directly next  to us. It was so bothersome that I sent my husband to invite them to our table! It's Christmas for goodness sake. He told my husband he'd finally been given a table, they waited for 2.5 hours! Here's my major complaint. If you're going to take reservations, seat them at least somewhat close to their actual time. This was complete lack of planning, experience, or a thirst for greed. Regardless of which (or all three) someone made a MAJOR mistake and I suspect it will cost you a lot of bad reviews and future business. The only reason you didn't get 1 star is your wait staff was amazing. So to you, the owner and/or manger, you get one star for being incompetent.   To the rest of the staff, 4 stars. It would be 5 if the people next to us hadn't waited literally 10 minutes for a plate so she could begin eating a meal she waited an hour and a half after her reservation to get. But don't worry, to make it up to the sweet ladies, WE bought their dinners.   I doubt we will be back. Texas De Brazil will get our business from now on. Or any other Brazilian steak house in town. Your food is great, with the exception of the lobster bisque, it for the lack of a better term, sucks.   Figure out how to take reservations you can handle. In the long run you'll make more money because you'll get return customers and positive reviews.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of coming to Via Brasil Steakhouse once before for a Yelp Elite Event earlier this year. This visit was strictly for their happy hour! I made reservations originally through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> because I know how packed this place can get. Upon arriving my friend and I decided that we instead wanted happy hour. I couldn't do an all you can eat meat thing that late at night... The tabletops are seat your self kind of thing and our waitress was super nice! I loved how honest she was with certain items on the menu that we would get ready to order. Proceed with caution on a few of these things because it's not made the normal way you may think because they Brasil way has a twist. For example the crab cake that they offered is prepared in a way that isn't necessarily the cake form most people are use to. The Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail which reminds most people of the mojito! I'll tell you what, It's no drink for the lightweights! This drink offers a nice punch so be prepared if you want to indulge in a few because they WILL sneak up on you!  Happy hour has a wide variety of finer foods and also some entrees. The drinks though are limited to just the Caipirinha's.. Our food choices consisted of a few sliders (Angus & Filets) the Brazilian fried chicken and the blackened salmon dish that came with sauteed spinach. Everything was delicious except the Brazilian fried chicken.. Overall everything was great and I have no found a new spot to add to my list for happy hour deals during the week!",

We were most impressed by the flavors and temperatures of every meat we tasted! Honestly, the food (both salad bar and meat) was much better than any other Brazilian steakhouse we have visited.

    "text": "I usually hit Fogo de Chao when they hit me with 50% deals to my inbox and because of that, I truly forgot how good this place is.  Since I've hit every Brazilian place in town I'll point out the pros and cons of deciding on this place vs. heading elsewhere further down below...  THE OFFERING: They give you two dinner options. One is $39.99 for 85% of the menu. The other is $49.99 and you get to add on unlimited rack of lamb, shrimp, filet mignon, table side cut ribeye, salmon, etc. Since it's main competition is Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brasil which are both $49.99, we all decided to do the premium dinner anyway and get the full experience (note, Pampas and Bertollucci in town are garbage. AVOID).  PROS: -Excellent quality meat, very tender and flavorful. Better than Fogo and way better than that Pampas dump, about as good as Texas de Brasil (town square). -Great service, they're friendly, you tell them what you want, they'll bring it cooked exactly how you like it, even if the entire table likes it's meat cooked differently. -Beef carpaccio on the salad bar! -was very good and all you can eat. No other place has this. -Lobster bisque on the bar was excellent, actually better than the bisque at sterling brunch. -Grilled shrimp had a nice scampi flavor and they are generous with it as they come around. -Fried, melted mozzarella with oregano, takes me back to the beach in Rio. Delicious and no other churrascaria in town offers this as well. It's good! A must try... -The atmosphere is nice and the tables are well separated so you feel like you have your own space as opposed to some of the madness at Texas de Brasil. I like the smaller dining room feel and private space. -The rack of lamb was large and meaty, bigger than most and cooked perfectly.  CONS: -The pao de queso (cheese bread) wasn't totally hot and fresh and fluffy like I'm used to. My advice is to limit yourself on this addicting, cheesy ball of dough anyway, so not a big deal. -The banana that I requested them to bring at the end of the meal desperately needed more brown sugar and perhaps a little caramel and a touch of cream. It wasn't sweet like the ones at Texas de Brasil. -The accompanying sauces are hard to find and should have their own place on the salad bar to grab. I had to ask for mint jelly, the Brazilian style orange colored traditional steak sauce was no where to be found. There wasn't any horseradish (I forgot to ask) and the chimichurri sauce (which was on the salad bar) had next to it such a tiny, yet deep condiment dish that all the good stuff settled to the bottom and it seemed I was dipping the meat into oil rather than being able to dig into that good green stuff. Advice for next time would be to ask for all 4 sauces up front before the meat parade starts your way. -Seldom do they offer discounts like Fogo de Chao and the occasional ones I find for Texas de Brazil.  OVERALL: The quality of meat, the grilled shrimp, the lobster bisque, the beef carpaccio and the melted mozzarella are what puts this place towards the very top of the Brazilian steakhouse Vegas cluster. I was very pleased with the service and food and we all walked out a perfectly happy, bloated mess.",

Via Brasil service & ambiance:  Contemporary and classy steakhouse decor makes for an attractive dining experience.  The beautiful salad bar is showcased in the middle to get your anticipation up.  The staff is great with keeping the table stocked with plantains, mashed potatoes, asparagus, etc to pair with your meats.  The servers were pros with cutting the meat they brought to your table.  Via Brasil cuisine:  Everything at the salad bar is very fresh and I made sure I didn't eat too much here to save room for the meats.  The cheese selection on point and definitely check out the delicious seafood medley salad.  I sampled a ton of the meats but my definite favs were: Prime Rib - Medium rare to perfection Garlic Steak - It had the perfect amount of garlic seasoning. Top Sirloin - Juicy and packed with flavor. I ordered these 3 numerous times until I had to tap out to meat sweats.  Overall Via Brasil is a great Brazilian Rodizio steakhouse option off the strip.  Their brunch options happen to catch my eye so I'll definitely plan a visit for that.  Cheers!",

    "text": "Wednesday evening, I took several work colleagues out to Via Brasil Steakhouse. 3 out of the 5 party members had never been to Via Brasil Steakhouse.  I really enjoy going to this Brazilian steakhouse. In the decor inside is quite intimate. The atmosphere is very laid back and upscale. There is a beautiful wall that is a waterfall that you could look at for hours! This location is a great date spot, or location to celebrate a family member.  We didn't have a reservation and walked right into Via Brasil Steakhouse on a Wednesday night at 6:00 P.M. We were provided a table in the back of the restaurant. The hostess and waitress was absolutely amazing! Our group was provided drink menus and a walk-through of the Brazilian steakhouse.   The team opted to go for the salad bar first. I ended up getting the following from the salad bar -  Rice Alfredo Pasta Bruschetta with Tomatoes   I came back and immediately flipped over the meats. I like my meat well done and all of the meats - chicken, pork, steak was amazing. The following cuts was what I ended up selecting  Meats: Ribeye Special  NY Steak  Prime Rib  Filet  Flank Steak  Brazilian Pork 1 Chicken Drums  Tangy Chicken  Chicken Breast   Tri-Tip  Garlic Steak  Sausage  Now, there are items that are not directly listed on their menu that may be served. Two of those items I ended up getting was the following  Filet wrapped in Bacon Melted Cheese  The two items that is not directly listed on their menu was actually the part of the meal I liked best. The melted cheese was delicious, and the filet wrapped in bacon was perfect. The meat was tender, delicious, and the bacon just enhanced those flavors!  For dessert, I selected their chocolate cake with whipped cream. It was absolutely delicious, but I feel that it was lacking in flavor to a certain extent. If they had swapped out the whipped cream for a vanilla ice cream on-top of the chocolate cake, that would be a perfect ending to a great dinner.  The meal was pricey for 5 people and drinks, however, the service and food quality was impeccable. Great Brazilian steakhouse in the Las Vegas valley.",

Booked a reservation for 5 and that was perfect because it was not busy yet.   Our waitress was BRI and she was awesome! So friendly and helpful. The menu was different than last time I was here. So much easier to order. Everything is AYCE now. No more additional fees for sides. We ordered a bottle of wine which was delicious.   The salad bar was full of so many great choices. I loved how it wasn't so carb heavy. Lots of light items and plenty of things for people who are eating Keto.   The guys bringing around the meat were on top of it. Never had an empty plate. If you want a specific piece of meat, just ask your waiter and they will be sure to get it to you. The meats were all so good. But I think my favorite was the sausage. It was amazing.   The manager came to our table at the end and told us all about the new breakfast they are serving. It sounds awesome and also sounds like it blows the other breakfast restaurants away. Can't wait to back and try it. It was a great meal with great service. Definitely going back soon.",

Add all their usual foods and you have a great meal.   We've eaten here many times. Food and service is always great. We've always been in the main dining area next to the salad bar, tonight, even with early dinner reservations, we where seated in one of their side rooms. A bit cramp, plenty of people dining in, but had a big screen right across so we could enjoy the cowboy game!   We really enjoy their salad bar. There are many choices from crab meat salad, cold beets, spinach, Caesar and stuffed cream cheese jalapenos! All fresh and tasty. The lobster bisque today was a bit 'lumpy' they needed to blend a little more as it had small clumps of flour. Previous visits, the lobster bisque has always been creamy and smooth!  The meats range from prime rib, filet, garlic steak, lamb chops, garlic shrimp, turkey wrapped bacon as well as table side carved roasted turkey, and so many more. All great taste of flame grilled.   Food was good, service was good, Meat's could have come more frequently, but we did get our fill! Overall, a great way to spend our holiday and we got a $50 gift card for dining in today! With the other rewards program they have, we have plenty points to have a couple more meals at a great savings!",

    "text": "I like Via Brasil, cute the hostesses up in the front :) Foreal though I like Via Brasil. Been here a couple times and for a local business I think they're an excellent option if you want Brazilian steakhouse but don't want to go to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil. Their meats are pretty good, though I hoped it was a little more saltier, just use to the saltiness from the others.   What I like about Via Brasil is that their atmosphere is a lot quieter and low key than the two mentioned above. You can enjoy a nice dinner. They also offer a Brazilian steakhouse experience at cheaper prices. You can have AYCE for like $25 during Saturday and Sunday brunch, or during Monday and Thursday night NFL games. The choices of meats are selective but the main meats are there like the Picanha, my favorite. On regular nights dinner is in the $40s-50s, similar price as Fogo and Texas.   On my last visit, during Monday night football, service was friendly and for most parts good but they couldn't keep up the my hunger. I was constantly looking at an empty plate. They eventually understood my frustration and took care of me. It just meant those I was dining with had to wait and watch me keep eating.  I'm still going to pick the chain restaurants, Fogo De Chao and Texas de Brazil. It's hard to compete with them. They have an army of workers so food is constantly being served and a better salad bar. I'll be back eventually, as long it's still like $25 during the NFL games.",

We brought in friends and the wife had never been to A Brazilian Churrasco  Steakhouse and furthermore eats like a bird, she absolutely LOVED it and it's the most I've EVER seen her eat!!!

I highly recommend trying this place out anything in the menu will satisfy. You have to do the all you can eat! I love the lamb chops here can't get enough. Don't even get me started in the bacon wrapped shrimp.   Doesn't get 5 stars because the service isn't all there. There's a manager with a man bun I notice every time he is on his phone and doesn't care about the guest. It doesn't fail that he is doing something other than helping deliver good service. One time I heard him talking about other team members out loud which isn't professional. I go there so much and he probably doesn't even recognize me because it seems like he's there to just hang out and kill time. The servers are the ones that keep me coming back. Management needs adjustment. Be friendly!",

It was the usual Brazilian steakhouse with the meat brought tableside but the buffet was different, there was breakfast and lunch options as well as an omelette / waffle / crepe station. You could also get an egg benedict brought to you.  I was surprised by the bottomless mimosas using fresh juice. I didn't drink as I elected myself as the designated driver but everyone enjoyed the mimosas and they were able to mix flavors like strawberry pineapple or orange strawberry.   I will definitely be recommending Via Brasil to everyone and visiting again for brunch or dinner. I have signed up for their email list too!",

I mean, I'm gonna go back and just order three of these and stuff my face because it was THAT AMAZING.   Piccanha steak- 3 Stars. It was good, but not as great as when you get it at the buffet.

This place allows you to buy items al a carte and has one of the BEST happy hour in town and it runs EVERY day which is great and they have fantastic drinks :). So not only are you getting premium food but the prices are unreal and the menu is 3 pages for the happy hour so there are just so many options. I must say the lobster Mac and the sliders are beyond good and it keeps me coming back and I have almost tried 75% of the items and I have yet to be disappointed. It's rare that a high end place has a happy hour let alone has one every day . As you will see below I go ham when I'm here and order a ton of EVERYTHING. You will thank me for educating you on this place but your waist line may hate me lol",

    "text": "This is an update to a former review I had written. I have come to this restaurant at least six times with my family since our first visit.  Yesterday I took my husband there for Father's Day, what a huge disappointment..  We kept returning because the service was always so nice and of course the food is delish. But yesterday the service was nothing short of TERRIBLE. The waiter stopped by only a few times. That meat service was only coming around every so often. Not constant like before. They were rotating the pineapple around like crazy though... The meat service was VERY slow. We tried to order the sides (mashed potatoes, etc) and the server tried talking us out of it since he said the kitchen was taking forever to get them out. We ordered mashed potatoes, asparagus & fried bananas. We were brought out asparagus and mashed potatoes, no bananas. We did not get our sides until the end, after we were done. We were so fed up with the service that my husband asked for the check and wanted to leave. The meal took 1.5 - 2 hours (and not due to the fact that we wanted it to last that long) to get our slices of meat to fill our bellies.  The check was $160 for 4 people (brunch prices, we typically spend over $200 due to dinner prices) and we felt so ripped off. We expect a certain level of service when we pay that amount of money for a meal... not to mention it ruined my husband's Father's Day meal.  Don't think we will be returning.",

    "text": "I will never eat here again!  Dear Adam Gomes, General Manager, Via Brasil Steakhouse,  Las Vegas, Nevada  8917  I have been a customer at your restaurant for many years and my wife and I, frequent your establishment at least four times a year for dinner in addition, at least that many times and enjoy your Happy Hour. I thought I should reach out and contact you before I post my commentary on my experience at your restaurant on New Year's Eve. I was contacted by your representative a few days before New Year's Eve and I was instructed that payment was required in advance in order to secure our 9:30 PM reservation. I was also told that a higher than normal price will be charged.  I was fine with that and agreed to pay in advance. I was told that you were serving dinner, at a lower price to other patrons that were served earlier that evening and for those that wished to attend for NYE, would be served in a party atmosphere with music, desert bar and a champagne toast. Per the request of your representative, I arrived at your restaurant just after 9:30 PM.  I want told I had to wait for a table.  I was not pleased I had to wait to be seated even though I pre-paid for a reservation at your request. You did not accommodate me upon my arrival as expected. I was not seated until around 10:10 PM!  Your service and planning worked to collect payment in advance but you did not provide the service you demanded advance payment for! You usual sumptuous salad buffet was lacking in some of your normal variety and, even more disappointing, was the fact that many of the dishes remained empty. The music that was played by your DJ entertainer was not matched with the demographics and age of your clientele that was in attendance.  It was an obvious and blatant error and was further evidenced by that lack of your customers on the dance floor.  How anyone as a professional can be so far off, is beyond belief.  This should have been recognized and immediately corrected.  Nobody seemed to be in charge and more importantly, nobody seemed to care. At this point in time, I feel like I need to find another restaurant to take my steady stream of business to. As a courtesy, I wanted to voice my experience to you in advance of posting this on any social sites. Hopefully you will learn from this horrible failure that evening and make changes in the future.  I wrote to Adam Gomes and his obnoxious wife, Anna, on two separate occasions in order to elicit some response.  They never responded and that only indicates that they do not care about customer relations!  I will NEVER eat here again! I suggest you do the same!  They don't care about their customers!  There are too many other great restaurants nearby.",

Then they start bringing out all the meat and chicken and lamb and the servers swarm around you all the time, even though you put the stop sign up. Very annoying and not comfortable and the food was just so so and not to mention how expensive it was. Too many other wonderful restaurants to eat at. Will not be going back.",

I found this restaurant online and they were AMAZING. They arranged transportation for our entire party from the chapel to the restaurant, and back to the strip. We were in the private room and it was perfect. The staff was attentive, fun, energetic, and so polite. It was almost like I wasn't in Vegas anymore. For 89.99 a person we had unlimited meat....excellent, yummy, and a choice of 20 meats....and unlimited premium drinks for 2 hours. The food was phenomenal. The experience was fun for all our guests and everybody had a wonderful time...it was perfect.  Anna, the event coordinator, was so great! She was there to greet our party, explain how the process works, and made sure every need was met. I can't recommend this restaurant enough...it was the perfect way for us to celebrate our wedding with all our family and friends.",

However, our reservation is at 12:30, we were seated at 12:35, and we are still waiting to pay the bill. The food quality was okay, not as good as Texas de Brazil in Town Square.  The salad bar left a lot to be desired. The sticking point has been the service, which has been tediously slow, and inconceivably so.  The restaurant had plenty of empty tables for brunch. We finally gave up and set our credit card on the table.  The manager finally picked it up, our server then told us that was a problem with our bill, and proceeded to take another 15 minutes to try to bring us the check.  We ordered a bottle of wine and to brunch menu items. I don't understand how this creates a problem. Via Brasil, you seriously need to work on improving your service.  This was a disappointment for us.",

A person (that none of our group knew) ordered food and drink.  After finishing her food, she left without paying her bill.  None of us knew her.  One by one, our group members individually paid for our food/drinks.  One member stayed behind to finish watching a game.  He had given the waiter $20 and was expecting change only to be surrounded by a group of people demanding money for that person that skipped out without paying.  NONE OF US KNEW THAT PERSON.  He explained that he did not know the person.  The employees of the restaurant were literally holding him there encircling him - and threatening to have him arrested.  Finally he paid (out of fear) for a meal and drinks of a person he didn't even know and has never met.  The management did not return my phone call.  Not only did he lose money for this unknown person, the waiter didn't give his change back from the $20 (should have been around $8).  The restaurant should hold credit cards if they are fearful of people not paying.  They should not make someone pay for and UNKNOWN person's food.  I would never go to this restaurant again.",

Not good for kids at all or picky eaters at that since the variety was limited. (Think alot of cheeses and weird pasta dishes...) I wouldn't come here again unless some else paid, and the desserts and drinks were extra. So a family of four (2 adults, 1 child and 1 free/infant), with drinks came to $160+ tip.

Here's my honest opinion:  The salad bar: 4.5 stars The sides (bread/plantains/mashed potatoes): 4 stars The beef/meat: 3.5 stars  I was left a bit disappointed with the meat.  Most of the meats too tough for my liking.   Add that with the slow service -- I was left waiting for more options with a green card flipped over.  As a result of the waiting, me and my friends ended up eating the sides (and bread) and filled ourselves up.    I was used to a Brazilian BBQ  like Fogo de Chao, where you get plenty of people serving you meat almost immediately when you flip your card over to green.    Therefore, I was left a bit unimpressed.",

    "text": "We came here for a paint night/happy hour event.  There was four of us in our group & this was our first and probably last time we will visit this place.  One of our friends ordered the chicken skewer appetizer and it was severely undercooked.  It came out half pink and white with pink juice dripping off the chicken.  Our friend thought the pink juice was from the sauce so she took a bite.  She tried chewing it but she ended up spitting it out cause she said there was something hard in the chicken making it inedible.  So she took another bite but ended up not being able to chew that piece either as she then realized it was still raw.  We flagged down the server who was beyond busy trying to accomodate our entire paint night group of around 40 guests by herself, which was ridiculous.  The server was notified and took the undercooked chicken back and our friend ordered some more bacon wrapped shrimp and fries which were both good but took quite awhile to get as was our drinks.  I ordered a white wine sangria, which was pretty good but took about 20 mins to get.  At the end of our paint night event the server brought us our bills and failed to take off the undercooked chicken skewer.  We brought it to her attention and she said \"oh, you wanted that off your bill?\"....Uh YES since it was RAW & inedible!  So she said she would check with her manager.  She comes back with another server and let us know that the manager could not take it off since some of it had been eaten.  We all stood there dumb founded and informed her that two bites were taken however both bites had been spit out since they were raw.  Our friend then asks to speak w/ the manager.  The other gal that was w/ our server comes back and informs us that she was able to get the manager \"to bend\" and was able to get it removed from the bill.  WTF...\"to bend\" to remove undercooked chicken that was inedible!!!  First off this entire experience was rather poor to begin with.  Clearly they were understaffed and management should know better than to have one server handle almost 40 guests by herself w/ one busser, hence the reason my freaking sangria took 20 mins to bring out.  Additionally the manager should've come out and apologize personally for the undercooked chicken, thats a health hazard & just plain nasty.  And lastly, the servers need to bring out itemized bills to all their guests, as we were all given just the credit card signature receipt only.  I had to ask for an itemized receipt.  Perhaps this business should invest in hiring qualified management instead of cutting corners by inadequately staffing the restaurant during peak times resulting in poor customer experiences.",

Having a buffet style dinner works really well for large groups but unfortunately many buffets are sub-par.  I read other positive reviews of Via Brasil and I must agree the food is awesome and you get value for the price.

The gourmet salad bar offers grilled Portobello mushrooms, seafood salad, beef carpaccio, fine cheeses, and many more.  My list of absolute faves you should try! Meats: Garlic Picanha Tenderloin Wrapped in Bacon Picanha (Top Sirloin) Prime Rib  Side Dishes: Salgadinhos Fried Bananas Grilled Cheese ...And if you want to end your dinner with a huge smile on your face, ask for their Cappuccino!

    "text": "I must admit, the first time I ate at Via Brasil I probably would have given 4-stars, but after my second visit I gotta go with 3 instead.  Let me begin first by saying I don't think VB is a bad place to eat. In fact, I think it's a very nice restaurant with very nice wait staff (including bussers, hostess, waiters, everyone!). On both of my visits I was pleased as punch with the service and the arrival of the meats/cheese bread/condiments/beverages.   However, on my second visit some of the magic wore off from the first visit. I went here for a birthday dinner with my fiance. On a Saturday night I made a reservation, expecting the place to be busy, but it definitely was not. Kind of a plus for us, except for the fact they sat us out in the middle of the floor. I was kinda disappointed with the seating and hoping we could have been seated in a more secluded part of the restaurant, but it was okay...  As for food. The meats were okay, minus the salmon, which was delicious. I tend to skip the sausages and chicken-type meats when I come to a Brazilian steakhouse. I must say though, I think all of the meats were overly-salty. Cooked well? Yes. But just salty. I went through three glasses of water.  The salad bar I think is okay, but not as good as Texas de Brazil.  Overall I'm saying it's an okay place. It is cheaper than Texas de Brazil. It is more intimate than Texas de Brazil. I enjoy the ambiance here. I wouldn't NOT reccomend Via Brasil, but it will probably be awhile before I go back.",

    "text": "Holy meat!   I discovered this place during an off-strip trip to Las Vegas.  This place is very much in the vein of Fogo de Chao in Los Angeles and other major cities.   Our visit occurred during Carnaval season and as a result we had a great time with all the dancers they brought in and all the beads and decorations at the tables.  It was a very festive atmosphere the night we ate dinner here.     The biggest piece of advice I can give about this place to newbies is \"don't eat for a day prior to going.\"  Cuz, you are going to want to gorge yourself on all the yummy meats.   Everywhere you turn there is a waiter carving up some kind of yummy morsal of meat.  If you haven't been to one of these meat fests, the general idea is that you sit and waiters bring meat to your table and carve off what you would like to try.   They keep coming until you tell them to stop. When you are seated each person is given a set of green and red cards.  You put the green card out when you are ready to eat and you put the red card out when your pants can take no more.   With chicken, beef, pork and more, you simply can't go hungry.  If you need some veggies they have the greens covered in a large salad bar which you can visit to your hearts content.   The food was really enjoyable and I would go again.    If you make it out of this place hungry then surely hell has frozen over.  Good eats, good times!",

My daughter loves the salad bar and goes just for that.  Tips: The Sunday brunch is the best deal out of all of them. It is $25 with many of the same meats along with breakfast items.  If you sign up for their email newsletter they will send you $5 off coupons for brunch. They will also send other coupons now and then for dinner.",

    "text": "We did Mother's day brunch at Via Brasil. The experience of dealing with incompetent hostesses and a staff with no knowledge of a proper restaurant reservation system deserved 1 star. However, the experience consisting of the food and the waitstaff service (after waiting 50 minutes and then finally getting seated) was 5 stars. So to balance it out, my rating is at 4.  A little delay and backup of seating times on big holiday weekends is understandable. However, the Mother's day brunch reservation system was highly unorganized and every single party (whether a 2-top, 4, 6, or very large party 10+) waited on average one hour after their reservation time to be seated. Many people were very upset, some left, some (like us) stuck it out and the feeling was very chaotic.  That said, the waitstaff and the quality of the food really came to the rescue. Once you were actually seated it was business as expected. The quality of the food was outstanding and some of my favorites were the beef carpaccio and turkey wrapped in bacon.  I will also give management credit for giving us several gift cards and complimentary desserts as consideration for our extremely long wait.  I'm not sure if I have confidence in Via Brasil's reservation system to go back for a holiday weekend meal, but for a casual meal with family or friends, I absolutely would.",

Had family out visiting us and they also left disappointed. No apology from anyone and what should be really embarrassing to you all is that I am in the restaurant industry and I actually wanted to take charge of your restaurant and apologize to your guest. And I bet no one even apologize nor gave anyone a discount for such service. What really sucks is that no one from your company will reach out.",

    "text": "Horrible start to our New Years Eve 2014. Took nearly 50 minutes to get seated after our reservation time. We finally had to point out a table that had been sitting empty for over 20 mins to the host team. One of the main hostesses just rolled her eyes at the other hostess for not seeing it. We were finally seated at 11:10pm. We watched as one other lonely couple also waited as long as us because the hostess gave away their reservation. We witnessed \"cousins of a waiter\" (a party of over 15 people) getting sat without a reservation long before us. We gazed at three empty tables in the bar- which would've suited us fine- but nobody was smart enough to come up with an easy solution. All we really wanted to do was sit down and eat and enjoy time with our friends that were visiting. Where was management in all of this? I started to feel sorry for the staff, all of whom seemed entirely overwhelmed and tossed to the wolves. A staff member told us that the Manager was too busy waiting on tables and leaving other waiters high and dry with very few tables on this incredibly busy evening. A manager never checked in with us at all the entire night, even after we expressed our dissatisfaction to our server- Girardo. He did the best he could and was pleasant enough.  The food was okay but the $80 fixed price NYE meal was a big joke, and I would not recommend it to others. The sides were pathetic. The top sirloin was very good. The whole experience was rushed, which was unfortunate as we were trying to spend a nice evening out with out-of-town guests. We had to rush and get everything we wanted from the salad bar before they took it all away right before midnight and changed to desserts. One of my friend's is a vegetarian, so she was counting on another trip up but before we knew it it had been whisked away. Very hard to justify a $360 bill for four people after the bad start to our dining experience. Over half the restaurant brought their children and they were all running wild all night long. I understand that some families want to be together on NYE, but would you let them go crazy like that on a normal visit to Via Brasil? The music was entirely too loud, we couldn't hear each other at the table. All in all, we couldn't wait to get out of this place and never come back. Definitely leaving Via Brasil in 2013. We won't be back- EVER.",

The guys serving up the meat actually ask if there is any specific meat you want to try and brings it out as soon as it's ready, straight to your table! Ask for the chicken hearts - it was great! Since it's less crowded, the meat comes around a lot quicker (I went for dinner on a Friday). Lobster Bisque from the salad bar was delicious with actual bits of lobster. My cup of ice tea and water never went empty. Lots of hot food options included if too much meat makes you sick. The only con was the spinach was too buttery.",

I was trying to figure out just how to make a regular ol' salad with baby gerkins, radishes, and lettuce...is that a salad?  Not to me.  There weren't even any onions!  There were quite a few flies though.  Several were buzzing around the salad bar.  A few visited us over at our table, too.  Salmon and clams were very fishy smelling.  Even after drenching my seafood in lemon, I couldn't eat more than one bite of each due to the overwhelming fishiness.   I feel bad fo the staff here.  They are trying very hard at this labor intensive set-up.  It's not their fault they have to serve such horrid crap but they do it with a smile.  $40 per person on this low quality for the Prime Rodizio is WAY over the top.  If they had more volume, they'd be able to turn the quality up and the price down. I had a $15 gift card that I got in the mail, so we tried it.  Not worth it, even with the discount.  I am a foodie and regularly spend anywhere from $20-$200 per meal with no alcohol.  I can aslo handle McDonalds.  I could not handle Via Brasil.  I got a severe headache the next day, rare for me, which I believe is from the abundace of salt that I ate at Via Brasil.  Fortunatley, it went away after I guzzled lots of water. I won't be able to go back to Via Brasil and I cannot recommend it.",

It's a big shopping center so we parked on the other side. We came just a couple minutes before our reservation at 6:45 and the male manager rudely told us it would be a ten minute wait. Okay well I guess we will go to the bar. The bartender was very friendly and efficient. We waited closer to 20 minutes for our table.  Out server Dante provided really good service as well as his two assistance. He had one guy who only seemed to do beverages and another one who picked up our plates and bring more side dishes. The sides were okay, a little under seasoned. The fried bananas were so good. They had the right amount of sweetness. There was constant stream of meat but it seemed be a lot of the same stuff. The sterling meal promises an upwards of 20 or more meats but I didn't feel like that was the case. The meat were well seasoned and delicious. The salad bar was okay, probably on the lower end of the spectrum. The salmon and chicken Marsala seemed to have been sitting there awhile. It was not very good. I wanted to try the flan but I was stuffed.",

    "text": "So, my fellow yelpers -   Both my hubby and I have a tradition - since we both have b-days in September, we usually will just go out to a nice dinner to celebrate \"our\" days.  Hubby suggested this place, after doing some research, and also hearing the word from co-workers. So in being a yelper, I of course came to yelp to check the overall rating. Then I happened to see the word 'buffet' in the description, and instantly had this nail going down the chalkboard kind of sensation. Stomach kind of lost its appetite a little, and I held my breath about what this meant - but being a good trooper - said nothing and just went along for the ride, figuring I'd at least give it a shot before saying anything.  Soooo, we pull into the plaza where this little gem is hidden, and I was taken back by the very fancy appearance of the building. And from the exterior looking in, I could see a little waterfall feature, so right away my mind was thinking - this is gonna be interesting!  Right upon entering the hostess was very pleasant and very happy to chat it up with my little one in a full blown conversation about her markers! (mind you my little one was the one having to show it off to begin with, but i give kudos to the hostess for entertaining my little one's need for discussing her markers)  Our hostess went and placed us right next to the waterfall, as my daughter kept talking about the waterfall behind the bar too, so we were very happy all around for seating.  Then came the onslaught of attention - really - i mean talk about being pampered little pooches - you name it, there it was! (I have been to some top rated restaurants (names will remain anonymous - not into bashing anyone here), and the service rendered tonight seems to just put some of those other restaurants to shame!!!!) A gal could get used to this kind of pampering for EVERYTHING! Back to the subject - the service. Let's put it this way - short of having a personal massage at the table to throw me into utter 9th heaven, I was well on my way heading there!  For those who have never dined here: you are assigned a table 'captain', whose sole job is to make sure your service is being met for all needs. He will explain to you how things work for the food. You get two cardboard chips, one side says \"no meat\", the other \"more meat\". You flip the chip according to wether you want meat or not. If you don't want it - there is the 'salad bar' you can visit, to get your delight of heaven: sauteed mushrooms, grilled portabellos, shrimp ceviche, lobster bisque, varieties of risotto, salad, fine cheeses, bruschetta, beef carpaccio, and a few other items.  Seriously though, service is impeccable. You drain your water cup, it is refilled before you know it (and sometimes without you even realizing it). Drop a napkin, a new one magically appears before you. If you even have a slightest bit of a question on your face, suddenly there is your 'captain' ready to assist you. These guys (and gals) are good! You finish your appetizer, they are ready to help clear your table to bring on your entree.   If you wish to feast on the meat side - well then just flip your chip to \"more meat\"! Then comes the never ending (unless you flip your chip) selection of meats! Prime Rib, Turkey, Sausage, Chicken, Lamb, Tri Tip, Sirloin. Here's a great part - you are given at your table setting a pair of tongs (originally thought it was for picking your own bread out of the basket, but nope was wrong), to help grasp the meat they are slicing for you off the oversized kabob sticks! (sorry best way to describe them). The meat is all roasted on large skewers in open flame, which is then brought from table to table, and you are served table side. All I can say is YUUUUUMMY!!!!  Oh and let's NOT forget the sides you can order as well!:  Grilled Asparagus (hate to admit, but these guys were a little on the scrawny side, no where's close to what you would see in the grocery stores) - smeared in  olive oil mixed with garlic. Hmmm. yummy! Fried Bananas - cinnamon, sugar, and something else all nicely fried up! I recommend this towards your dessert end. Yucca Fries (pretty tasty! Never had it before, but I liked it!) There was more for sure, but can't remember them all at this point. My brain is clouded with all the good eats I had!  And juuuust when you think you can't stuff anything else into your bulging tummies - the DESSERT cart winds its way to you upon request! By this point my belly is bulging, my eyes are bulging, my brain is on heavenly overload, and yes I'm getting dessert by golly (special celebrations only come once a year!)!  I dove for the chocolate cake. My daughter picked out the blueberry cheesecake. Neither of us regretted our choices! (ok hubby had no input cuz we felt 2 deserts was best, and our little one was already pining for her blueberries (thanks to Dora the Explorer).) Trust me, YUMMMMMM. Yelp is telling me I'm out of space (NEED MORE SPACE DARNIT!!!) P.S. Kids under 5 are FREE! :)",

    "text": "Sweet i've found me another happy hour that is both enjoyable and not wallet busting.  Started out with a Passion Martini (Sky Passion Infused Vodka and Muddled Strawberry) Very girly looking drink with the reddish pink color and bits of muddled strawberry but it's light and has a pleasant sweetness to it without any bite from the vodka. Well balanced but not very pronounced in the passion fruit flavor. I tend to order drinks slightly on the sweeter side and this caught my attention because i have a soft spot for passion fruit. Had i payed attention and actually read the rest of the menu i would have ordered the Passion Fruit mojito.  We came from another nearby restaurant taking advantage of their happy hour and someone suggested that we hit up Via Brasil's since it's pretty close by so i didnt order very much.  Grabbed a Asparagus Risotto that was decent at best. It tasted more of a rice in a heavy sauce with some asparagus bits instead of an actual risotto.  Additionally while browsing the menu (regular menu not happy hour) the Brazilian style kale soup caught my eye and i ordered one of those. The broth was very bland and the sausages they threw in had no flavor at all. Also the kale was julienne so there was no big chunks of kale instead there was a huge mess of kale slivers. I was in the mood for a soup and this one didnt meet my expectations but then again who orders soup in a Brazilian style steak house?  I plan on coming back here in the near future. Since it was my first time here i didnt know i can order the same cuts of meat by the ounce and pay for it that way instead of doing the entire Brazilian steakhouse dining experience",

Service was decent, just not as authentic or friendly as Texas.  Pros: Food good, not great. Convenient location.  Cons: Pricey, not as many options as other similar restaurants, service just okay.

    "text": "Brazillian Rotisserie.  I know it tastes great, I know it is a somewhat unique way to dine, but I can never get past the 44 dollar or more price tag so when I received my father's day $29.99 coupon I had to go and take the whole family.  The salad bar was fresh and the lobster bisque was ok, if a little flat.  But we don't come here for the salad, so I turned my card up and said bring on the meat.  The favorites were the pork loin (surprisingly tender and flavorful), the lamb, the pork ribs, and the fillet wrapped in bacon.  The fails were the chicken and turkey which were dry and appeared overcooked.  Also the salmon was bland.  The rest of the meats included beef ribs, sirloin, strip steak, and sausage.    They come around often and mostly ignore the button, asking you anyway.  The sides are not very good and you don't really need them as your salad bar should give you the illusion of eating something healthy.  Pace yourself and don't be afraid to say no or come back later.  Of note: Kids are 14.99.  Happy Hour is 5-8 pm daily and includes a selection of appetizers and drink specials.  Thursday night is locals night and women are 29.99 and men 39.99 plus the appetizer specials are for the entire restaurant.  Sunday Brunch is 24.99 and includes some of the meats as well as an omelet station.  Bon Appetit",

The server pulled my seat for me and pushed it to the table and placed my napkin on my lap. At one moment, I had dropped a few crumbs and was going to clear them, a server came over with a special rake to take care of the crumbs.   The food was delightful. On the salad bar, I loved the aspargus risotto, scalloped potatoes, grilled asparagus, fresh mozarella, and marinated arthichokes. The grilled items: corn on the cob, mozarella, pork tenderloin, sirloin, tri tip, baby back ribs, beef ribs, and prime rib.   The service here is a cut above some of the others, in my opinion.",

    "text": "I love me some churrascaria. I would like to take a brief break from this review to let you know how much, to the tune of \"I Gotta Feelin'\":  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday (Do it!)  Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday, (Do it!)  Get, get, get, get, get with us you know what we say, say  Churrascaria every day, churrascaria every day.  Now that I've gotten that out of my system, let's get to the food. I went to this place with my cousin, Paolo D. and we yelped while we were eating. How cool are we? As a result, I have a pretty sweet record of what we ate and how much I liked it. So let's get it started (another BEP reference in 1 review. Score!)  Non-meat items that I thoroughly enjoyed: - Asparagus risotto - rich, creamy, just wish it spread on the plate more - Fried bananas were delicious and subtle in their sweetness - Cheese rolls tasted great when they first came out.  - Caesar salad was really good just add garlic oregano dressing. I love salad.  On to the main course (aka, things that I love): - Chicken drumsticks were the first thing I had, really flavorful and I highly recommend them. - The Seafood in the salad bar was in desperate need of salt. Good thing they have the salt and pepper shaker handy. - Skirt steak was surprisingly amazing and tender - Garlic steak was not tender but really flavorful - Beef Ribs were delightfully fatty and tender - Parmesan pork was dry but had a nice crust - Service was very attentive  So this is where I get annoying and nit-picky (not to worry, this is still a 5-star review): - The \"Brazilian Mashed potatoes\" were really fluffy. Almost too fluffly. They tasted instant to me, although I am sure they are not. Is it possible that you can make something so well that it gives the impression that it comes out of a box? Possibly. - I wish they had fruit or something sweet to break up the heaviness of everything. And no, I am not going to pay for dessert after stuffing my face with 20 kinds of meat. - Salmon was okay but the passion fruit vinaigrette really brought a nice break to the meal - Bacon wrapped turkey was meh  Overall, I think you should go here.",

You're better off going to Samba or Fogo de Chao where the service and food exceed Via Brasil's by far. This awful and regretful experience began as follows (this is a short version of what happened as I've omitted several other problems we experienced).  I had a fairly large party bringing in a fair amount of business into this unprofessional establishment.  When it came time to pay for the check, methods of payment were provided.  The waitress came back to my table and hand selected her choice of credit cards (neglecting the ones she didn't want to use) and OVERCHARGED each card by over $60 per card which EXCEEDED the check amount.  When I asked why she conducted the transaction this way she simply said, \"that's just what I was told.\" I immediately asked her to correct the charges and provide correction for the wrong doing.  She came back twice still charging credit cards incorrectly.  To make matters worse, the manager lied and ended up charging me an unauthorized deposit.  The manager said the money would be placed back onto my credit card in 24 hours.  To this day, the money has yet to be refunded AND they charged an amount different from what was said would be charged.  The manager was rude, unprofessional and incompetent. She clearly doesn't know how to correct her wrongdoings so  she unprofessionally rushed my party out the door. This was by far the worse dining experience I've ever had.  If I were to rate this negative stars I would.  I highly advise anyone who is thinking of going to Via Brasil to avoid it and spend your money elsewhere. I would also urge the owner to fire the current manager who was present during our dining experience and hire a manager who is capable of handling and conducting him/herself in a professional and intelligent manner.",

The brunch is a great value ($19.99 for adults if you join the e-club) and the Brunch has: Breakfast food, Salad Bar.....and of course the MEATS! They also have grilled pineapple which is awesome. If you do the Brunch.....ask for a \"Filet Mignon Benedict\" and be prepared to have a little slice of Heaven. This place is very similar to Texas de Brazil, but I think its more affordable and the atmosphere is more laid back. Dinner is a little more.....around $40 per adult, but the food is always GREAT and I have been here many, many times.....never a bad experience.",

Took our drink order, water w/lemon, which he never brought. I had to ask another server to bring over. He followed up with very dry service once and asked if we needed anything else. I found myself pulling upon busers to assist for more water and bread basket. In fact, in closing of our meal, the buser is the one who asked if we wanted dessert as opposed to our servers closing of, \"all done?\" My daughter wanted to order a Shirley temple the entire course of our meal, sadly he never followed up after the water he never brought... Disappointing. The food however was enjoyable. A bit on the pricey side for poor service.",

The only slight negative is that the salad bars at the two other places were larger and had a better variety of stuff.  That is the only reason I did not give it five stars.

You will not regret it after tasting the amazing selection of meats (we all especially loved the lamb!)  And our 2 kids were free.  We will be going back for special occasions.  Oh, and they told us over the phone \"formal dining but you can dress casual\" so we did...next time I will dress up  just a bit more as everyone else was in suits/dresses.  Awesome customer service!",

We all ordered the Rodizio dinner It was a little difficult for the servers with the meat to get around the corners of our table, but overall did a great job.  The salad bar is pretty large with a nice spread of items to choose from.  A wide variety of meats and cuts were available.  Initially, it was hard to enjoy the food due to the interruptions from all the different meats coming out.  It is a bit overwhelming for the first-timers to this type of dining, but I would definitely go back.  The bacon wrapped turkey, the bbq pork, and the tri-tip are among my favorites.  I had the Creme broulee for dessert and it was very good too.",

I would like if the cuts of beef were in rotation more or equal to the other meats (turkey, chicken, etc.) The lighting and mood is very dark but still has a nice feel. This is definitely the place, I feel for a more casual and slower paced dinner vs the hustle and bustle of some other restaraunts. I have also attended the Sunday morning brunch, surprisingly that was much more busy -- make reservations!!! The Waffle and omelet station was tucked at the end of the cold buffet, one lone cook with a Waffle iron a few topping and a pan for the omelets. As busy as it was there should have been more people to help, the guy at the table next to us eventually cancelled his order because it took way too long. All in all this place isn't on the top of my list but it's not too bad.",

As a traditional brazilian girl I love rodizio style and this restaurant offer so many types of meat, my plate was always full of meat and the side dishes are amazing, I almost got all of them because I miss brazilian food so much and in Vegas is so hard to find a good and authentic food. The salad bar had a good variety as well and a lot of hot dishes like chicken milanese my favorite.  The servers were amazing, my table was always clean, my water glass was never empty and the wine was perfect. An amazing combination for a perfect dinner.  Coming back soon to try the brunch that sounds really attractive, Rodizio + Breakfast. Will stay there for at least 2 hours",

    "text": "You had better like meat to truly enjoy Via Brasil.  The atmosphere is lovely and the staff is quite attentive (more on this later).  If you are not familar with the concept these brazilian steakhouses are an all you eat motif with a salad bar and then meats on long skewers are brought to the table and you can have as much of them as you desire.  Most of the meats were hot (not all) and flavorful.  There was prime rib, steak, chicken, sausage and some I am probably forgetting.  They also include in the price all of the side dishes you want, served in a family style fashion, meaning enough for the whole table.  The sides were OK but not that special.  I actually found while the salad bar had many choices along with soup that making an old fashion salad was not an option.  But if the salad bar is your thing you are going here for the wrong reason and paying way too much.  We were celebrating a 60 year anniversary for my girlfriend's parent and they made us feel special and catered to the 80 year olds well.  My biggest complaint and one which really lasted with me was that the servers and our waiter while seeming polite were actually rude when it came to interrupting on-going conversations at the table.  None of the servers or the waiters seemed even remotely aware that when they come to the table with questions or food to say \"excuse me\" or wait until they were noticed and instead they proceeded to talk at us with no regard to what was going on at the table.  In some ways I am betting they see this as being attentive but if the same thing happened any other place it would have been classified as what it was, rude.  In my opinion and this is what Yelp is all about, the staff was poorly trained in this one area.  They were otherwise quite gracious.  One last issue and while it was only $7, we had purchased a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate for $3 which was to cover the first $25 of the bill.  They informed us they were no longer accepting the certificates and offered us a $15 discount. How you can decide to cancel an offer we already paid for is beyond me and they tried to appease us but ended up cheating us out of a few dollars, just not cool.  For those who love beef and who can afford over $40 for dinner this place is still a great experience and be aware as others have written that unless you want to pay dearly for water be specific and ask for tap water.",

Everything was cooked perfectly and we had excellent service.  So no complaints about that.  What knocks this review down is the appearance of the place and of our table.  We had a reservation yet were seated at a tiny little table in the back next to a temporary station that had high chairs,  a water station, extra glasses, etc.  There was no table cloth or any type of decor on the table.  It rocked back and forth.  The floor looked a bit dirty - not deep grime but the type of dirt brought in from outside on your shoes.  Our table was so tiny we barely had room for all our side dishes plus our drinks and main plate.  Our table looked like a temporary inexpensive piece of furniture that was utilized for overflow and for the price of this meal the restaurant should have nicer and larger tables for customers. Because we were seated next to a high traffic wait staff station there was a lot of noise from that area.  It detracted from our meal.    Via Brasil, please give smaller parties as much attention and consideration as larger parties.",

My advice is have ur events and do not open your restaurant for the public because you cant handle it. From the moment we sat to the moment we left. The meat came every 15-20 minutes (only had picanha once...extremely upsetting for a Brazilian like me), we ordered sides that arrived when we were already done, and the waiter responsible for our table was completely lost. Thank God they had a salad buffet with an amazing crab salad otherwise i would have left starving. Today is was not worth my money!",

But when you're \"CAMPING\" a table having an endless talk either take it to the bar or somewhere outside the dining area.     Hence our experience X-mas dinner. I've visited Via Brasil plenty of times busy and slow to see the wonderful intelligent hostesses that worked that night do their magic (holiday and non-holiday);NOTE: these host specifically DO NOT GET POOLED TIPS manager Anna shared with me in the past, which still amazes me the loyalty these lady's have to the position. When overhearing them inform every guest \"we're waiting for tables to clear up...\" was NO JOKE. I traveled the dining rooms and viewed many tables Couched in their seats with No plates, No spec of food or drink and a checkbook pushed aside of their table acting as if there's no one else that's going to use their table after.    When finally sat to our table with no rush from the hostess despite the commotion , we were greeted by our Server seconds later.  For the hardworking loyal staff of Via Brasil on delivery great service and accommodating our picky needs. And for the strong hostesses, sad I am to witness their spirits crushed by ungodly rude uncourteous people who refuse to understand/see the hardships of working in the rest. Hospitality field especially on holidays! Where's your Christmas spirit or human kindness?  For the management/owners who rather than bending employees, stepped in to assist their team. ThAts where they were rather than wasting their time hearing your complaints of a problem that they are hands on solving. Shake it off and keep up the great work Via Brasil.  To those reading these rough reviews from people who expect their but to be kissed. Spare your judgement on regular days and stop by yourself. Experience REAL hospitality and customer service the way it should. Holidays are never easy. VBS isnt the only one with low reviews on a holiday. Unlike Texas and Fogo or any restaurant who see guests as $$$$ Via Brasil go above and beyond seeing you as friends/family.",

The most redeeming part is the bartenders who even though they had a crowded bar tended to everyone promptly and had conversation.   The hostesses weren't polite at all. We were sat 30 mins after our reservation, which overall isn't to bad considering other people were waiting over an hour past their reservation time with walking being seated before all of us. When asked an approximate wait the hostesses would immediately grab the phone and try to ignore the large mass of people with the same question. When asking for the manager, everyone was told \"she's to busy.\"  After finally being sat we looked at the side order menu and when then told the only two available from the list were mashed potatoes and asparagus. The salad bar was very lacking. The bread was delivered with raw dough centers. The medium and medium rare meats has a leathery skin. The bacon wrapped filet had raw bacon where the meats touched on the skewer. The waiter was only seen twice in the hour we were seated. The meat servers while polite seemed to come all at once or not at all. The side dishes were a children's portion for a table of four and they would not bring more than one at a time.   Overall. If you're looking for a nice decor for drinks at a bar I would recommend it with the courteous and excellent bartenders as a Brazilian steakhouse. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.",

A selection of 8 different meats plus 3 types of made to order eggs benedicts, made to order waffles and omlettes, and a salad bar all for $20-$25. This is so much better than fighting it out in the casino buffets. I always make it a point to eat here when Im in town.",

    "text": "Bring your appetite!  I got a coupon from Groupon so I took my son for two of their all you can eat dinners. I'm sure they have more dining options but I can't speak to them. The decor is classy but not stuffy. Overall I'd say its comfortable with a touch of elegance.  We were seated, given a quick once over on the way to dine (the stop/go button), the salad bar, the free sides, etc. From there we grabbed plates and dove into the salad bar.   This isn't the usual buffet salad bar, not by a long shot. The quality of everything there stood out. I highly recommend loading up a separate plate with their grilled portobello mushrooms. These go so well with the meats to come that you'll want to have a plate there as a side.  Back at the table, the meat on a skweres started to arrive. They had salmon, beef ribs, top sirloin, skirt steak, lamb and I'm sure I'm missing one other. Different parts of each skewer were cooked to different temperatures so if you preferred medium rare and someone else at the table likes medium well, they can accomodate this without a problem.   All of the meats were excellend but for me the best by far is the skirt steak. Be sure to save room feel free to request it, they go out of their way to be accomodating.  The only minor criticism is that my son felt the meats were a bit on the salty side. I didn't notice this but he's always been more sensitive than I to salt.   Overall, highly recommended. At $45 it may be a bit pricy but if your a dedicated carnivor with a good appetite, you'll be glad you went.",

    "text": "OH....MY....GOSH..... sooooo AWESOME! gal pals Susan and Justin went with me to eat at Via Brazil. We started by ordering a pitcher of PINEAPPLE SANGRIA.  The glass was 9 bucks and the pitcher 23.00  didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out which one to order.  It was delicious, so tasty , remarkable white wine and fruit sangria that really went well with what was to come.  Since I am a carnivore, and this is a carnivores dream- I have to say it was amazingly good. The salad bar had so many tasty items - I don't suggest filling up on these ... because the main attraction is the meat.  and ohhhh the meat was soooo good.  They start your meal with these little cheesy rolls .. they are like a hot chewy cheezit. YUM! Then the salad bar... Parade of meat.  Our server was completely awesome wish I could remember his name.  We had a great time and even a fit of giggles from being so ECCLECTIC!  Pricey so this is a once in awhile treat - but have to say it is worth every penny. I would go back just for the sangria... but the meal is so yummy I would HAVE to stick around for that too.  Vicious Cycle.  I suggest trying it ... eating is believing.",

First and foremost the place is casual...saw people in t shirts and flip flops on a Friday nite. :) The \"salad/appetizer\" bar is a meal in itself and the place to start off. Be careful NOT to overeat at the salad bar because it is easy to do with the 25-30 items !! When you are ready to begin the main course, you simply turn over a coaster to \"green\" and the servers with skewers of 15 plus meats come by and you can say yes or no. When you want to be left alone, turn your coaster to \"red\" and they won't bug you. Look at staying around 2 hours and pace yourself !! Excellent choice for special occasions..",

    "text": "Recently, my family of 4 (my wife, two kids-9 & 6, myself) celebrated my wife's birthday at Via Brasil.  She had been there once before, but this was the first visit for the rest of us.  I had trepidations from reading so many comments about how \"formal\" it was, and how it was not good for children.  Both of those comments could not be farther from what we experienced!  When I made reservations online, I clearly indicated that we would have two young children, maybe just to see if the restaurant would give some indication of their reaction...but within 10 minutes, I got a phone call to confirm the request and welcoming our children to dine with us.  At that time, I also mentioned that it was my wife's birthday, and they graciously said they would \"do something\" as a surprise.  Yes, I know this is becoming perhaps an all-too-familiar 'perk' for restaurants as well as many diners (to have to hear Happy Birthday chanted several times during their meal!).  The decor is upscale and suggests the kind of place with some snoot appeal, where people may come to be seen, but let's face it, this is a suburban restaurant, and what restaurant would risk alienating the down-to-earth folks with an overly haughty attitude these days?  Via Brasil gets it just right in that the 'hardware' is upscale and formal, but the staff and service is engaging and friendly, without any pretentiousness whatsoever.  When we arrived, I immediately noticed many parties with children...although I couldn't help but note that they all seemed to be seated in the front section of the restaurant, and that maybe the staff was consciously trying to keep the back part of the large open dining area somewhat kid-free and quiet.  It didn't matter to us - the entire dining room is beautiful, and the food is the same regardless of what GPS cell your table is in!  As for the food, I rated it 4 stars and not 5 just because there were some items that were not quite as superlative as others.  Everything happened as others have mentioned:  you sit for a short while, order drinks, and build up a little more anticipation, but then it's a bee-line to the buffet, which had more variety than the average casino/hotel buffet.  Salads, soups, and various hot dishes (stroganoff, a curry dish, a risotto, seafood paella, etc.), along with appetizers that were presented well and tasted great (carpaccio, asparagus,  etc.).  NOTE:  The captain had come over shortly after we were seated to let me know that our 9-year old would be given a very reduced price for the entire meal (around $15, I think), and she would be able to eat anything she wanted (all meats, etc.), and that our 6-year old would not be charged at all.  While I don't know if that's their standard policy, I felt that was more than fair, and certainly goes a long way to encourage \"family dining\" at this restaurant from time to time.  The waitstaff was great in handling our children, too, always stopping at each one of them to see if they, too, wanted to try whatever cut of meat they were offering on each round.  Even as we were coming back with full plates of appetizers, freshly grilled meats were being 'walked' around the tables, and the noshing (if one can 'nosh' on meats!) started right away.  Before we knew what hit us, we had cuts and slices of so many different types of meats...and most of it was excellent.  All of the beef offerings (rib eye, picanha, flank steak, garlic picanha, and the prime rib; we passed on the ribs because they were too huge and wouldn't fit on our plates at the time) were fantastic.  My wife enjoyed the lamb chops immensely, though I wish we had stuck around for the leg of lamb to make its rounds.  The other offerings - turkey, pork, and salmon - were a little hit-or-miss, probably because I prefer my meats less 'garnished', and these were typically crusted or sprinkled with parmesan or wrapped in bacon.  Actually, I enjoyed the salmon, though many may find its smoked flavoring a little washed out and bland, and its texture a little pasty instead of flaky (imagine cooked small roe!).  The sausage didn't do anything for me...but then again, I'm not a sausage fan.  Before we knew it, almost 2 hours had elapsed, which is saying a lot when dining with 2 children!  They had sampled quite a few meats, too, and while it may not become their favorite restaurant, I think the \"bigness\" of the experience kept them from becoming restless, and they both said they enjoyed VBS.  I'm running out of room here..so I'll just say LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  They also remembered my quick comment about my wife's birthday, and delivered birthday wishes as requested!  Definitely a place to consider for all occasions, but do plan on spending a good deal of time and money (around $150 for the entire experience, even with the generous discounts for the kids, and we aren't wine drinkers).  I hope this place stays around a while!!",

The bacon wrapped turkey was overly salty.  The restaurant was practically empty, could have been because it was a Thursday? But the buffet was still fresh and the meats still came out as if cooked just for us.  Overall this place fulfills your need for variety without giving up too much in terms of quality.  Atmosphere can use a little work, I know its Vegas but this place is borderline tacky.  Wine recommendation was fabulous.",

    "text": "I cried on my wedding day, and no, they were not tears of joy. I had dealt the entire time with Anna, who was in charge of event management. We agreed on all of the prices and everything was set in stone for my wedding reception. I gave her my credit card and asked her to charge the rest of my balance after I knew the final count. She responded to my email thanking me for giving her the credit card information and said she would charge my card. I was coming from Delaware so I wanted to take care of all of my payments before I arrived in Vegas so there wouldn't be any surprises.     All seemed to be going well during the reception. Everyone was having a good time and the waiters were attentive. All up until my brother comes up to me and tells me how they asked him for a credit card to pay. EXCUSE ME?? I went up to the manager and told him I paid Anna before I left. Oh, and where was Anna by the way? Not there of course. She didn't even show up to oversee anything. I told him I didn't bring my credit card with me. I thought all of this was already taken care of and my credit card info was in Anna's email. In the end, my parents had to give THEIR credit card info because I didn't bring mine stuffed in my dress (and mean, what did they think?) It was very upsetting and embarrasing. After emailing Anna the next day she tells me they don't normally charge your credit card until after the reception in case more people come than you plan. So why the hell didn't she tell me this?? Then I would bring my card with me!! The Dj ended up eating (and he was the only extra person we had) and of course we had no problem paying for him, but if they had just said that night \"We need (so and so) money for your DJ it would have been a hell of a lot easier than them saying \"We need thousands of dollars to pay for your entire reception party. It was very disorganized and handled completely incorrectly. And I still have yet to get a sincere apology out of anyone.           I regret having my reception there and wish I had gone with Pampas on the Strip or El Segundo Sol. Both had excellent communication and were very helpful. Honestly, even if it's a little more expensive it's worth going with somewhere on the Strip because after paying for transportation for all of your guests to get all the way to Via Brasil it evens out anyway! Also worth noting, we had our welcome party at La Salsa Cantina and it was EXCELLENT! Great service, the sweetest people to work with, and we had a blast! I even paid a little too much on my deposit because we had less people than I anticipated and it was refunded within a day.      Oh and one more thing...They still owe me $100! They had me down as having an extra guest that I didn't have. After emailing them 3 times to tell them this I don't feel it's worth my time, but just thought I would note that screw up too!           STAY AWAY!!",

The food selection and quality are simply perfect for anyone who wants to have a True brazilian steakhouse experience outside of Brazil. The buffet options are also very good.

I've been to all of them and the last one I went to is Via Brasil - I wish I had gone there first. The price is not that different from the other options in town and the quality is undoubtedly better (meat quality and presentation, amazing cheese bread, good buffet and larger variety of cuts - which composes a more accurate representation of brazilian steakhouses). They also have some traditional brazilian foods that I thought I would never find outside of Brazil (like bolinho de chuva for dessert and chicken hearts).

The hostess and staff are always friendly, on-the-spot and very professional as well as personable and fun - yet it is not expensive.  DO YOURSELF A FAVOR - if you haven't yet, go in and see for yourself how amazing Via Brasil Steakhouse and everything about it is! I have visited many times and have had the wonderful and always perfect rodizio dinner, which is ridiculously beyond words and well worth the nominal price; I'm going to focus on another aspect of this paradise in the south Summerlin area of Las Vegas - their happy hour.   SATISFACTION - It began with a group gathering reserved in their private room, and I was so impressed with the hospitality, service, food and prices that I decided to arrange with the owner a happy hour with a social group.   Since then, I have held the same get-together there at least monthly, and I am a regular there on my own. Here is why:  TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT - Every menu item (over 30) is specially priced during happy hour, which lasts longer than most \"bar\" happy hours: 5pm-close, Sun-Thu; 5pm-8pm, Fri-Sat. Everything I have tried is spectacular, and our members love the place, so we continue to return. The selection of food, spirits and wines from around the world and all this restaurant has to offer is a reflection of the owners, who are awesome, kindred people!  YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED - Dressy or casual (respect yourself). The list of what I have always enjoyed at Via Brasil Steakhouse is too immense to list. Here is the link to their website:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fviabrasilsteakhouse.com%2F&s=03ee1e7b0a96363f1496de207bb6e7c9e00247a3ca770c18a275889590abdd8a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">viabrasilsteakhouse.com</a>",

It's a huge restaurant so to see such attention to details really made me a fan. The food was terrific, a meat lovers paradise. I enjoyed the atmosphere, however was a little too warm. I will certainly return and save room for some dessert and maybe try one of their many wines.",

There is a very good selection of appetizers for $5-6, and a lot of them are very, very tasty.  I've tried the sliders, empanadas, asparagus risotto, and beef carpaccio.  Everything was great, and  I can't wait to go back to try everything else.  The salads look delicious. The $5-6 drink specials are great too.  They offer mojitos (classic, or muddled with fruit), and also caipirinhas.  The caipirinha is a pretty strong drink made with lime juice, sugar, and an alcohol made from sugar cane juice (tastes kind of like light rum).  You also have the option of having this with muddled fruit.  It's great with kiwi, and extra lime. They do get really busy, so service can be a little slow.",

We had calamari, lobster bisque, asparagus lemon risotto, Brazilian cheese rolls, and a sampler of fried goodies including meatballs and shrimp empanadas. We also sampled red sangria, passion fruit mojito, caiphirina and wine. And topped it all off with chocolate mousse.   $54 for 4 cocktails and loads of food with leftovers to take home. Everything was delish. The fried items were slightly indistinguishable from one another but tasty nonetheless. Calamari was cooked perfectly with two yummy dipping sauces. Bisque was salty, rich and dreamy. The cheese rolls are especially delightful soaked in the aforementioned bisque. Chocolate mousse was rich and creamy.   We had a lovely cushioned sofa and table on the patio. The service was great. Very friendly and over attentive.   We will definitely be back, and soon!",

    "text": "Better than Fogo.  I have eaten at 8 different Fogos. I have eaten at 20 or more off brand non fogo style places. Generally I always come away thinking \"should of gone to fogo\".  Via Brasil is the first place where I have come away thinking \"better than fogo\".   I will assume you are familliar with the concept of a churascaria and not explain the concept and what not, here is a point by point break down of item/winner. The service at both is excellent blah blah blah  Cheese bread- Fogo. Via tends to be a little drier and the individual cheesey poofs are smaller. They are also not served as piping hot.  Lime aid- fogo by default  Black Beans- fogo- actually has linguica/pork in it.   Other sides- Via and it isn't close. They have way more options (including Yucca fries, street food etc).  Caipirinha- Fogo. It is more consistent, comes in a nicer solid feeling glass, and they dont have fruit flavored options which is a plus.  Meat Picanha- this is just about the only meat that fogo wins. While picanha at Via can be great, it is inconsistent where as every single god damned time it comes around at fogo it is life altering.  Beef Rib- Via. It is never dried out, and since this is one of my favorites I view it as pretty important.  Bottom sirloin- my other favorite- fogo. They have similar cuts at Via occassionally but no salt encrusted cheap ass bottom sirloin... god its so good  Top Sirloin/Alcatra- Via- it comes thicker here which means you can still get more slices that have a crust and are medium/rare  Sausage/Linguica- Fogo  Pork Ribs- i never get these at either place, mediocre always  Parmesan Pork- Fogo by default  Frango/Bacon rapped- Via- oftne when i get these at fogo the bacon is not cooked/crisp but the meat is over cooked- a sure sign that they have been left in too long away from the fire. Not so at via  Lamb- I don't relaly eat this either when there is so much beef available but dining companions tell me fogo is better  Ribeye and Garlic Beef- these are very similar and both are better at Via",

    "text": "Ugh, Valentine's Day service! So many reasons to HATE this place. Here's why:   Arrived in time for our dinner reservation at 9pm, only to be lied to constantly about the wait time. Wait time? With a reservation??? Apparently so. We hung out at the bar with a lot if other angry people with delayed reservations. Management came and went, never really providing much of an update and obviously had little concern for what was going on. We heard cuss words. Not very professional at all.   Since we were seated about an hour late, the salad bar was beyond picked over. There wasn't much left and it was messy.   The side dishes were skimpy. The spinach was salty. Other sides were ok but very small.   The meat servers never seemed to make it to our table. They circled through the tables on the same pattern, and always ran out of meat just before our table. Awesome. In an hour, we had only been served meat three times. Wow.   I checked in on Yelp, which offered a free dessert, only to be told that they would NOT honor the free check in coupon because it was a \"holiday\". Well....THEN WHY DO you HAVE a check in coupon?!?! The dessert we did have was disappointing (watery Tiramisu).   We have been to all the Brazilian style steakhouses in Vegas, and loved it. Viva does NOT do Brazilian steakhouses justice. In fact, the poor service and bad food make the other steakhouses more appealing. Viva makes McDonalds look appealing.   I can honestly say that we will NEVER be back and we will tell all our friends, family and coworkers about our horrible experience here. Cannot believe this restaurant will be in business much longer treating customers like this. HORRIBLE.",

    "text": "Holy crap, I hit 100 reviews on my last review and didn't even notice??  And I did my 100th reveiw on some sub-par establishment?  Shame on me!  To make up for it, my 101st review is on someplace stellar!  Via Brasil is on point!  Really a very good place to have a protein-filled dinner!  Calories?  Who cares!  With over 14 types of meat to choose from and a stocked salad bar with over 30 hot and cold items to choose from, you're gonna wanna get a taste of everything Via Brasil has to offer!  We started our meal with their warm Brazilian cheese buns which were gooey and tasty.  Our server also showed us that with each meal besides the all-you-can-eat salad bar and the meat, we also had unlimited choices of any of their side dishes that came from the kitchen.  I can't remember the entire sides menu but we ordered:  -Sweet potato fries -Collard greens -Fried bananas   We placed our sides order in before we were escorted to the salad bar.  This was another treat.  It seems Via Brasil is on par with Texas de Brazil on salad bar selections, and there was many high quality items to choose from:  -Caesar salad  -Grilled peppers -Marinated portobello mushrooms -Hearts of Palm -Caprese salad (pretty good, creamy) -Seafood salad -Fine cheeses  Along with the salad bar are six hot dishes that are offered, on this day we tried:  -Mushroom risotto -Fish in lemon butter sauce -Rice & beans  All the salad bar items we sampled were fresh and pretty good.  I love a good salad with marinated fresh grilled veggies, brings on a sense of balance before you attack the meat like a t-rex!  Via Brasil's beans were super good, I loved the smoky flavor with the addition of the hamhock in the mix.  I had two bowls!  The only thing I missed from Via Brasil's salad bar versus Texas de Brazil's (and I should be ashamed in saying this) is that at Texas they have California Roll sushi on the line.  'Faux-shi'...for shame!  I dunno, I guess I just like having the option of eating it if I want to!  Shortly after we got our salads our side dishes arrived.  I enjoyed the tart of the collard greens, and both the sweet potato fries and fried bananas were good.  We finally flipped our little marker to green and off we were to the meat races!  We sampled just about everything on Via Brasil's menu that night:  -Garlic picanha -Sausage -Flank steak -Tenderloin wrapped in Bacon -Beef Ribs -Prime Rib -Leg of Lamb -Salmon -Chicken drumsticks -Chicken hearts  Just about everything was excellent!  I noticed that Via Brasil uses a bit less salt than the folks at Texas which made the flavor of their meats a bit more appealing to my palette.  I loved the garlic picanha and their flank steak, juicy and tender.  The prime rib was great, just be sure to ask for a thicker cut!  The beef ribs were very good with their house BBQ sauce, I was eating part of a slab like Fred Flintstone!  The leg of lamb was not 'lamby' at all.  I had a small issue with the salmon, it was on the dry side.  But the surprise of the night was the chicken hearts, man were those good!  Reminds you of a Japanese izakaya because of that grilled flavor.  We almost ate an entire stake of these ourselves!  I am no stranger to exotic food!  Give it a shot and try it...you just might like it!  And don't forget to ask your server to bring their chimichurri sauce for your table!  It's a must for your meat!  The mix of olive oil, garlic, lemon, parsley and other herbs gives your meat that punch of flavor which will ignite your taste buds.  Super good!    Via Brasil also does offer various dessert choices but after the meat attack we went through we were too full to order anything, I'm thinking maybe next time?  And yes, there will probably be a next time.  Service was very good here, our server was attentive, kept our glasses full, and answered any questions we had about the salad bar or the types of meat they served.  And don't forget to join Via Brasil's e-club!  You receive news on special events and promotions, as well as possible BOGO coupons on your birthday or anniversary!  Always a plus in my book to save that dough!  I missed the old Makino that used to be in this space, but Via Brasil has done a great job taking over.  We left happy with joyous memories, and our bellies full of food.  Food that alas, will force me to work twice as hard in the gym to burn these meaty calories off.  Uh...I work out!!",

Super friendly and always willing to help you when it comes to ordering. My husband and I were debating on changing out drink order and the beer our waiter recommended was amazing! Will definitely order from there again. There has only been one incident in regards to wait times on a holiday (we had reservations) and they quickly resolved the issue along with treated us with free desert.  They are always on top with treating their guests like superstars!  And the food! Always amazing! The speed is perfect and always coming back when they knew which meats we preferred over others. The salad bar has a wide selection but it's perfect to start you up before a big meal.   For some people they might say this dinner is too expensive (I think it's well worth the price for the quality they serve!!) but every so often they offer specials that help you out when on a budget! :]",

    "text": "Our initial trip to this highly rated (Zagat) Churrascaria did not begin well when the greeter did not seat us immediately or even after 10 minutes despite the fact that we had a reservation.  Three parties who arrived after us were seated ahead of us. Explanation given was that they wanted to clear a nice table for us....hmmm.  A comped desert from the manager soothed our feelings however.   These style of Brazilian steakhouses which have sprung up around the country in recent years charge about $40 -$50 for an endless serving of 20 or 30 different types of grilled beef, lamb, chicken and fish. You basically strap on your feed bag and let 'er rip.  Quality of the meat in these establishments is hit or miss and quantity comes before quality here.  Lots of sides are included.  The meal is actually pretty good if you contain yourself and select the different cuts of meat wisely. At Via Brazil, we liked the filet mignon wrapped in bacon, the NY strip, the chicken drumsticks, the beef ribs, the flank steak, and grilled asparagus.  Suggest you avoid the garlic steak and tri tip -- tough and chewy during our visit. Some of the meats were over seasoned -- too salty -- and the cooks need to have slightly gentler hands on their salt shakers.   A salad bar is included and I would say it was average at best and inferior to what we have experienced at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, two competitor chains. The selection of cold and hot salads was not as varied and numerous as we have seen elsewhere. The selections they did have were tasty and fresh however.   Our party of three ordered the Sterling meal and the Prime meal plus an ala carte salad and fish entree.  The Sterling meal costs an extra 10 dollars and there are premium meat selections (lamb chops, shrimp, NY strip) that come with it. In my opinion, worth it.   A pretty good meal and pretty good table service and I recommend Via Brazil without reservation.  Decent value for a good meal, not perfect but a nice restaurant nonetheless.",

We had a great conversation with one who is from Brazil and everyone I encountered was very friendly.  The atmosphere and people working there seemed very authentic.  The salad bar included pasta, chicken marsala, rice, cheeses and bruschetta.  The meats were served hot and juicy.  At one point I forgot to turn over my card and the meat kept coming and coming.  I've never had so many types of beef cuts in my life.  The salmon and shrimp were cooked perfectly and very delicious.  I can't wait to go back for brunch.  My only complaint would be the chair, it looked like there was some cushion but was not comfortable and my butt checks started to hurt after awhile.  Could've been just the one I was sitting in. I would've preferred a booth but If they had booths they were in the rear of the place and not being offered.",

One of the dinners has 14 meats and the other has 21 meats. If you havent tried this place and you're a fan of these types of restaurants it this is a must try... im sure you'll love it!!!",

I heard good things about this place so I called on Saturday to ask questions about the menu, pricing etc.  The girl was very friendly and convinced me to swing down.  The friendly hostess greeted me when I arrived. She remembered talking to me on the phone.  She promptly sat me and said that someone will be with me in a minute. A few seconds later I was greeted by another staff member who explained how things worked. She didn't leave me the little red/green card however.  Finally after getting a replacement card, I turned it green. Within seconds, food started getting delivered to my table.  Unfortunately, there was a few times, my table was passed by even though the card was flipped to green.  The rest of the staff was attentive to my needs by refilling drinks, getting replacement silverware, etc.  I was not impressed with the salad bar. The meat on the other hand was delicious!     It's unclear as to what the lunch pricing is. I was told $25. Then I was told $19.99. Then was told the price is going back to $25.  There should be some consistent pricing.  I was also charged $4.50 for a Coke. That's higher than what other places charge-even though you are offered free refills.    I would like to try this place for dinner. There are more meats added to the dinner menu and I would like to try them out.  I rate this place 3 1/2 stars.",

I just wanted to box up ONE plate. if I had known the Brazilian Steakhouse was cool with throwing away loads and loads of perfectly good food, I would've just ordered a bowl of lobster bisque.  Lobster bisque was good but could've been thicker, the bread rolls were ok, the top sirloin, turkey wrapped in bacon and sausage were my particular favorites but most of the meat was excellent. The side dishes were an absolute joke. We ordered fried bananas, the asparagus, the spinach and the rice side dish with the intention of sharing amongst the seven of us, which turned out to be impossible because they're single serving side dishes only. Restaurant was Pricy and ambient noise was loud enough to drown out companions waitstaff and others.   Atmosphere was pleasant, the company was great so I did have an enjoyable time but I will not be returning, nor would I recommend via brazil",

It was more average than anything compared to their major competitors.  The pros were the shrimp, salmon, side dishes.  I also liked the spaciousness of the restaurant and the tables not being too close together.    The meats were okay but nothing special. My lamb chops were very small and very over done. The salad bar was also pretty small compared to the other places.  I found the constant upselling and pressure to buy drinks and dessert a little annoying.  It was okay at first but then became constant.  The assistant waiter and support staff was very good.  The speed of service was very good also.  I'm not sure I'd go back and have mixed feeling about this place.",

There are lots of different meats to try (lamb, sirloin, steak, meat, meat, etc) and unlimited sides (broccoli, garlic bread, corn on the cob, etc etc) as well.  The meat is served to your liking; rare, medium, well done.  There is also a dessert cart with creme brule, chocolate cake, etc all ~$7.50.  They also have a drink cart that makes special Brazillian drinks.  The food bar has salad, rice and potatoes.  Overall, this place has good food and service.  Plan to leave here stuffed!",

    "text": "Wow!  What a great meal! The waiter comes to your table with a bread basket with several doughnut hole shaped buns.  They are Brazilian cheese buns dusted with parmesan cheese.  There were excellent!  I started with the salad bar and took items sparingly.  I tried the cold, sliced portabello muchrooms, one tomato caprese, asparagus risotto, two small artichoke heart halves, and two large shrimps and a piece of fish from their hot seafood mixture.  This was the extent of my salad bar foray as I didn't want to fill up on salad.  It would be a great dinner in itself.  I turned the coaster to the green side meaning bring on the meat.  Before they started that, a waiter brought three dishes to the table - one with 3 fried plantains, another with mashed potatoes, and a third with green beans with garlic.  These were my vegetables to go with my meat.  A lot of food to accompany a lot of food.  I didn't try all the meats as I was filling up before they had a chance to bring everything to my table.  I liked the small sausage, the first meat I tasted and it was excellent.  Beautiful seasoning.  Then I had two thin slices of rare prime rib which was excellent also.  I had both the chicken breast wrapped in bacon and the tenderloin wrapped in bacon.  Both were very good.  The seasonings were perfect.  I am a salt user extraordinaire, but I salted nothing except the mashed potatoes and green beans.  I had the garlic picanha (top sirloin) and it was superb!!  I also had one slice of beef rib which is sliced from a rack of rib (large--not baby back) and served on a separate small plate.   Since there were only two tables occupied in the restaurant, there weren't several guys walking around distributing meat like rodizio restaurants.  Two guys were tasked with the serving.  I didn't get the pork loin and I forgot Tony's mentioning of chicken hearts--damn, damn, damn.  Well, something to look forward to next time.  After all this, I did hold back so I could try some dessert.  I had a slice of peanut butter, chocolate chip cheesecake.  Oh yeah--great!  Service was impecable.  My iced tea was refilled often, staff was always around to answer questions or see if you needed something.  I was greeted at the door by a delightful young lady and she also bid me a kind, smiling farewell!  The place is very nicely done.  I love the wine rack that goes almost to the ceiling.  I could see the super ladder inside to extend and reach the highest shelves.  This is a great deal with a Groupon.  The Groupon was $21.  The regular price for the rodizio is $42.95.  I'm not sure I'd be back for the full price, but the Groupon certainly makes it a great deal.  Come on Groupon--let's get anohter Via Brasil.  And you know, I'll probably go back and pay the full price if one of my friends from out of town who loves rodizio comes to Las Vegas.  We'll go together!",

The filet was tender, fresh, & delicious! Anything wrapped in bacon is good, but the shrimp wrapped in bacon was AMAZING & it came on a small bed of rice w/ a simple sauce. The fries were ok & a bit greasy. This was our first time trying food here so we didn't see if it was being made fresh or not, but it tasted as if it was fresh & not sitting like other booths. If it tasted this good there, I can hardly wait to go eat at this place in person to get a full sense of the food & atmosphere. Def a place to check out for the food!",

    "text": "I'm not sure who you are, as the owner we spoke to was a man and the only other person we spoke to was the hostess. I was trying to keep the other review short but here is a little more detail to clear up a few things. We didn't have too big of an issue with the wait. We were told 10 minutes, not 15. The hostess even at one point said it should be soon. We said ok, thank you that was fine. I did ask her if we could sit behind the large plants in front. She said it was closed in the afternoons. There were a couple tables occupied in that same area. But we said ok. Even when the 2 topper was seated before us we didn't mind, as they were a smaller table. My family has all run and owned restaurants, we understand how it works. When the larger party walked in and was sat immediately we asked if they had reservations. No answer. She just smiled and giggled. That's when we got frustrated and said I'm sure you can understand how this looks and why we are upset. At which point we were worried about being rushed. She told us we would be taken care of. So we asked for a manager. After hearing our story he apologized and said that a table had paid 40 minutes ago but was still there. At which point still didn't explain why the other party was seated first. Now if they said yes, when we asked if they had a reservation it wouldn't have been a problem. But the hostess didn't answer and the owner said it was due to a paid table not leaving. So that's when we stood and said we are leaving. The owner said have a nice day. I won't allow anyone to treat my employees like this. We were so confused by that statement. We asked him how we did such a thing. Once again he didn't have an answer. Just said have a nice day. Therefore we were never asked to leave. He decided to say those things once we stood and said we were leaving. As we passed the hostess we thanked her. So I'm not sure where you come off accusing us of berating and saying we were asked to leave. Our issue was with the owner. I even asked him if he understood that our frustration was that this other party was seated first and that had nothing to do with waiting for a table to leave. His response to me was he doesn't want to hear my explanation, have a nice day. Which was a total disregard for me.",

There are plenty of delicious rodizio meats to choose from, but if that's not your thing, there is also a soup, salad, and hot food bar, plus a waffle/pancake bar. Everything is delicious and the service is outstanding. I highly recommend the weekend brunch.",

    "text": "I went here on a date with my boyfriend and ate here for my first time the other night and everything was absolutely incredible! We walked in without having any reservations and were greeted and seated right away. The hostess was super friendly and informative.   Shortly after being seated we were greeted by our server. He had a charming personality and thoroughly explained how everything worked.  We then headed for the salad bar and they had so many wonderful choices. They had options between salad, appetizers, meats & cheeses, pasta, chicken, soup, and more. I got the Alfredo pasta, potato sald, seafood salad,  and bruschetta. My favorite thing was the seafood salad. It tasted so fresh and was just simply amazing.   After eating the salad bar options, we then started the meat service. (We also had the Pao De Queijo brought to our table as soon as we sat down-which is bread with a cheese center). The meat was absolutely phenomenal and so many options. I got things like beef short ribs, grilled shrimp, lamb, new york, rib eye, filet wrapped in bacon, turkey wrapped in bacon, pork, Brazilian sausage, picanha, and there was so many more that I can't entirely remember. My favorites were definitely the turkey wrapped in bacon and the grilled shrimp. All of the meat was juicy and full of flavor. We also got some side dishes of friend bananas and sauteed mushrooms. They were incredible.   Our server made sure to check in on us to see how everything was, made sure we always had water in our glasses, made sure we had certain meats brought to our table (and at the exact temperature we requested) and brought out our side dishes right away. The manager also personally stopped by and introduced herself and made sure everything was to our liking as well, she was so sweet.   We finished off our meal with banana flambe, and it was just spectacular.   For the price of the meal we got we received meats, side dishes, and we were able to eat from the salad bar all you can eat, it was definitely worth it.   I will be returning multiple times cause everything passed my expectations. I also plan on booking a private event here in the near future as well.   If you're a meat lover, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND checking this Brazilian steakhouse house out. You won't be disappointed",

Lately, when we don't want to cook and we feel like eating healthy (veggies and protein), this is a great option.  I order the roasted vegetable salad which has vegetables of all different colors(sweet potatoes, eggplant, red peppers, and spinach) and is very tasty! For protein, I order the turkey wrapped in bacon ( ok so there's some fat but I'm sure you could order it without the bacon) besides the picanha, it's the best thing in the menu!  When I don't feel like eating healthy and not spending a lot of money, I order some slider with French fries. My favorites are the angus sliders! Those are amazing!!   Whether you want to splurge and get the rodizio, save money, or watch your diet, Via Brasil is the place!",

They brought out a single lamb chop with shaved cucumbers for $12.99. The menu said 5oz but was served maybe 1 oz. When I confronted the waiter about the serving size all he could say I will get the manager. It turns out the manager was the owner. There was no apology, barely an acknowledgement the portion size was wrong and said he would go check with the kitchen if the order was correct. He returned with 2 more chops but did not offer to cover the meal. This place is a total bust. Nothing like it used to be. We will not be returning. What a disappointment.",

Well not tonight, We ordered two steak and fries $24.99 each. It came with sauteed mushrooms and fries. We received two steaks, two containers of ketchup, two containers of red wine Demi glaz, and one container of fries. In total there was 12 fries. I called the restaurant assuming one order of fries was forgotten. The manager informed me that I got all I was supposed to get.  He was rude and extremely disrespectful. Why was everything packaged separately except the fries, according to him they very conserving containers, no the truth is you forgot one order and didn't want to have to have someone bring it. If you review the picture on grubhub it show 22 fries that I can count and there is more since it piled on top of each other.  Stop screwing over customers it's really a shame. We will never dine with you all again and definitely not order for delivery. Also, I almost forgot teach the cook to let the steaks rest before placing in the container,  since having it arrive in a pool of blood also isn't very appealing. Save your money if you want a good steak don't get it here, heck Outback would have been a better choose for sure this night.",

It was odd to pay more to make sure that you could have every type of meat that came by. We had 6:30 reservations and arrived almost a half an hour early to sit in the bar for a bit before the rest of the party showed up. It was impossible to put a drink order in at the bar. In the 30 minutes we were there, the bartender apologized several times and finally just told us that we would probably be at our table before she would be able to get us a drink. Again, it was just odd.  The salad bar had a lot of different options and was pretty fresh. I had to laugh at the \"clams\"....when you open the serving dish labeled clams you are greeted with a pile of clam shells and not a clam in sight. The server was friendly and the meat was well prepared.  In all, everything was ok....but I am not super excited to go back.",

Oh because you can get a cheap brunch for $29 but you get what you pay for.   They have zero business serving Brazilian meat.   Their meat is flavorless and they obviously cook the meat super cold. The meats are never red nor pinkish they are always a dull brown.   If you get the filet mignon eggs Benedict the hollandaise sauce taste of just lemon. The filet has zero seasoning.   Their salad bar is even worse.  The cous cous over cooked, the soups just everything here is POOR QUALITY.   I honestly feel like only older people enjoy this place because of the price and those who do not really have a refined pallet.   Has the owner or manager actually ate this food? If so and you still serve it #SlapYourself",

First off service was awesome George our waiter was on top of everything split the tickets for us and was constantly keeping up with us.   Happy hour prices are fantastic, just amazing deals and two pages of items on the happy hour.   The food was excellent no one had any complaints or issues and I have to say we will be back on a regular basis. Excellent food and service and incredible prices. Saturday happy hour was from 5p-8p no one does that in Summerlin.   With so many new places opening up and many with big names this local neighborhood place which has been there for years outshines them all. Highly recommended for happy hour for sure and I'm willing to bet the dinner is just as good.   Also the manager came over to say hi and that was a nice touch. We are losing the good service in Summerlin and this was very refreshing.",

The first time we came for the AYCE, and their selection as well as quality was way below par compared to the other Brazilian steakhouses in town. Very little to choose from at the salad bar, and the taste was bland. The meats didn't taste very fresh and everything was super chewy and salty.  The next couple times we came for their bar menu with groups of 8 to 10 people. The food took over an hour to come out, and this last time it took an hour and a half for everybody to receive their meals.!!! There were only like four other tables with people so we couldn't understand why the kitchen was so slow. On top of that the pao de Cajo bread came out stone cold 2x and when they served them the third time they felt like they had been microwaved. The \"plain\" rice was insanely salty, The Churrasco steak was so salty and chewy I had to return it. The Angus sliders Were so dry they were not edible.   This place is a far cry from Texas de Brazil. If you want good Brazilian barbecue, it's worth dealing with the strip traffic and wait (unless u have reservation) to eat there. That place is awesome on all levels.",

Both the food and service were phenomenal and at a price of $25.99 (we had a special promo from their email club making it only $19.99) it is well worth it. There is a salad bar that has a bunch of salad items, fruit, cheese, charcuterie, pancakes, bacon, the list goes on; in addition to the salad bar there is an omelet station, waffle station and a crepe station. Then of course there are all the meats that they come around with carving table side and everything is all you can eat. BONUS you can also add on unlimited mimosas, bellinis and blood marys for $18.99 (I think a la carte the drinks are around $8).  Our party was somewhat staggered, with some joining later than others and I believe we were there for almost 4 hours with everything said and done. At no time were we rushed or hurried along; they were very attentive with great customer service throughout. It was a great experience and celebration and can't recommend this place enough. We will definitely be back again for brunch and will be trying dinner sometime soon.",

It was our first time here, so we weren't sure what to expect but everything was perfect! Our waiter explained the fixed menu and the couple's packages they offered as well.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed trying the various meats. The waiters were constantly coming around with new and fresh meats (chicken,  beef, pork,  steak--all of it was great!)  The appetizer bar (which is also unlimited)  has a good selection of items that complement the dinner very well.   The sangria is also very yummy and I reccomend the tres leches cake!   We also got a bogo coupon for our next two visits!  We will be back again!",

The bar is to the left of the entrance and it's a great size. Good amount of seating and little tables around it as well. They opened the side on the restaurant next to the bar where you can feel the perfect spring breeze while enjoying appetizers and drinks. There is outside seating if you want to enjoy the outdoors. The salad bar was not too overwhelming. They had your salads, one type of soup, little bite size refreshing appetizers and some amazing chilies! We got the \"sterling\" which is $50.99 per person but you get all the meats on the menu. You can request some meats that you don't see coming out with your waiter and they'll make it for you in the back. Which I think is amazing! Fresh and ready for you in just a few minutes while the cutters come walking around giving you other choices of meats. They are super generous and all of the workers are so kind. We met one of the owners and she is great! Super sweet. My hubby's favorite meat was probably the beef short ribs and I think it was garlic steak. I love the shrimp, chicken hearts and the salmon. The best side was probably the fried bananas! The breading was perfectly done and it wasn't greasy at all. It's amazing! The bartender is awesome too. Ask Miguel to make their special Brazilian drink. Tip him well! He's awesome!! Tip your waiters well too. They do all work hard to make your experience the best. Cheers! Happy eating my fellow Yelpers!",

We had a dinner reservation for 7:30 but did not get seated till like 8:15ish. I love the flavor of all the meats but service was sooo slooowww. Nobody really checked on us during or after we were done we waited and waited for someone to give us the dessert menu. I guess since we are a big group the tip was already included in the bill they don't feel the need to give us good service? Mind you our bill was 1K+. So we got good food but bad and slooowww service. Probably not a good idea to come here if you're a big group.",

Not nice about it at all. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We did not even have dessert yet. So after a brief discussion we were able to get dessert. Food was excellent as always. Then we received our check. They billed me for the whole table and again for my half of the bill. I understand it was busy but to try bully us out and then screw the check up. The check was over $250 plus another $125 not including the drinks we had waiting to get our table. We had our firm party here last year. Guess who is not coming back.

Our party of 14 people were charged 200$ per card without our consent when it should have been 126.00. The manager wasn't apologetic at all she kept sending her server out to deal with us. After messing up the bill not once but twice they still over charged my sister. They placed a 70$ deposit which was promised to be returned to her account which never happened and completely overcharged her by $275. After over an hour of waiting for the corrections to be made on our cards the manager finally made her way out and blamed her own server for charging everyone incorrectly. It was down right inconsiderate and poorly ran, you would think they would comp a meal or take something off however a thing.  When calling back a day later to have them correct the charge the host said there were busy and couldn't take our call. They are also RACIST, when calling back a 3rd time the person who picked up referred to our party as the \"big black polynesian family\" and was so rude.  Still a week later and nothing has been credited back to my sisters account. We will continue with legal actions and report this restaurant to the better business bureau. No one should have to be deal with such ignorant people and be charged for the incorrect bill.",

    "text": "Disclaimer:  we were here for a seminar, so we didn't pay for the meal.  But we still got pretty much the full, regular treatment.  The restaurant is really beautiful, and there is a long, but very narrow, outdoor patio.  Of course it was too cold to be eating outside, but I wonder how this would work with the Brazilian rodizio concept.  I imagine it would be more trouble than its worth.  We really liked the salad bar, with its huge assortment of items, most of them pretty tasty, and I tried very hard not to pig out.  But with such a vast assortment, even a minuscule tasting of everything adds up to a substantial portion.  The meats, though, left a lot to be desired.  The first one served to us was the turkey (or was it chicken?) wrapped in bacon.  It was so salty that I couldn't eat it, and it wasn't just the bacon;  I took that off, but the salt permeated all through the meat.  The rest of the meats were mostly tough, oversalted, and lacking any flavor, except for the beef ribs, which were really good.  Service was difficult; it was hard to get a waiter's attention, but this could be attributed to the group set-up.  I wouldn't downgrade the restaurant because of this, since it may not be totally valid.  This wasn't the first Brazilian rodizio restaurant we've been to, so we have others to compare it to.  It's fine for the money, and we'll likely come back.  But first we'll try some of the competition in town, which seems to be growing weekly!",

Every time we've come in, the service has been great and the food is incredible. Tonight we decided to celebrate Valentine's day here, BIG MISTAKE. We made our reservation 3 weeks ago, for tonight at 7:45pm. We arrived and weren't seated until close to 8:20-8:30pm. After finally being seated, it felt like our table was invisible, a server never came over until a manger passed by and we had to ask for someone to serve us. I wish I could say the lack of attention ended there but for the continuation of the night, it seemed like we had a sign over our heads that said \"Avoid this table\". Every time we needed a clean plate, a refill, or any form of service we had to grab an employee to grab our \"server\" (who seemed to be a manager or something) to help us out. Our \"server\" was awful and acted like we didn't exist, which is funny because I think she was a manger of some sort. She kept calling us table 69 so for anyone that cares, she was serving us at table 69 at around 8:30pm. The meat was really really good like usual but it was very upsetting to be completely ignored the entire night on this special holiday. We finally got fed up and asked for the  check, which surprise, she forgot to bring so we had to grab her and ask again. The whole experience was very disappointing as my boyfriend has spent a lot of money at this restaurant over the years and has recommended this place to so many people. Highly, highly disappointing and honestly considering not coming back because of the disgraceful service we received tonight and the lack of care that was put into our Valentine's Day dinner.",

    "text": "Terrible! My wife and I ate here after a crossfit competition. We were starving and in need of some protein. We chose to give this place a try as we've tried several other Brazilian steakhouse throughout the valley.   The salad bar was horrible. The selection was small and they were removing hot foods as they were checking the temp of the water and the burners/warmers weren't working. I appreciate the fact they removed the food that wasn't being kept warm...it just further reduced the already minimal selection.   The meats weren't well seasoned, sides of yucca and fried bananas were underwhelming. I ordered black beans and rice but my waitress never brought it out. I didn't even remind her as my wife and I didn't want to risk yet another poor tasting dish at that point.   The only good tasting food was the sauteed shrimp. Save your money and go to Texas de Brazil or anywhere but here.",

    "text": "Made Mother's Day Brunch reservation. Worst mistake!  Not only did they overbook & fell way behind, long over an hour in seating, but the Lead Hostess played favoritism in seating some customers that had reservations 15mins later than us until the hard working (clearing tables) Manager approached her & asked why \"John wasn't seated yet, you have to seat him now\". He should have switched places with her and made her clear & wipe tables!  Finally got seated over an hour an half late & then noticed there were numerous empty tables?  What????  The advertisement made it seem like there would be a good selection of breakfast items at salad bar, omelet  station Etc. No one was manning Omelete station. Only one pan & burner sat there unlit until sometime later. No waffles till later, no pancakes. No pastries to speak of. No sausage, only scrambled eggs & bacon.  Before making my reservations I was told of these various stations & that the Omelete station would prepare eggs to your liking, like over easy Etc. Big disappointment!  The meat items were good as expected but that was the lunch part.  Near the end of our meal our waiter brought small side dish of plantains & mashed potatoes for 4 of us. We were told the increased price of $37 would include a good selection of Desserts?   Really Sad selection. The increased priced also Did Not include any drinks!  If you want a real brunch and expect breakfast items, I would not go to Via Brazil.  If you don't care to eat a lot of meat but want a decent balance of breakfast & lunch items this is not the place to go for Brunch. Not even for the regular price of $20.  I still tipped 20% & now, not sure why other than to help the innocent workers.   I would never go to another brunch here again, anytime, nor dinner on a holiday unless I see a big change in brunch menu & service along with less overbooking reservations.",

    "text": "I can not give this restaurant anything less than 5 stars. The food is phenomenal and the service is top notch. We've been there at least 3 maybe 4 times and the food is always fast, hot, abundant and incredibly delicious. The waitstaff is very friendly. And very attentive. On slower week nights, the staff will almost hover around you. Like the minute your glass is less than half full, here they come to fill it up. On our last visit we ordered the signature Brazilian drink the caipirinha, delicious by the way, and when the manager came around to check on us, she noticed our drinks were not being drunk, and asked if they were made to our satisfaction, the truth is with all the food; the amazing salad bar with its impressive variety & the yummy side dishes you get to choose from & the parade of seemingly endless meats served by friendly gauchos, the drinks got overlooked!! We forgot all about them!!! But major points for noticing that there may have been an issue with them.   I know this isn't the only churrascaria in town. There are several to choose from. Texas De Brazil in town square, good. Same exact concept but different vibe. Very hustley & bustley. A very different pace than Via Brasil. And certainly not as friendly. And I once used the restroom there...to wash my hands before my meal. And it was not a good experience. Someone had some major issues in one of the stalls and I couldn't get the horror out of my mind all through dinner. There is also Fogo de Chao which I've never tried but can't imagine it to be better than Via Brasil. Via Brasil's location scores points too...not in a busy mall or on the strip.  Great brunch & happy hour specials as well. If you like meat, this is your place!! And if you don't, you can order just the salad bar portion which has a good variety of hot food too! Last time they had steamed clams on the bar!!! Jackpot!!",

The meat was \"slowly\" coming toward us and it got cold all the time. With my complaint the \"capitao\" that is the nickname of the Chef he then made sure that the meat got to us warmer. The only kind of meat I wanted came just 1 time. Picanha. The only piece of meat that I can say was good was caw ribs. The pork was coming with a weird sauce. Rice ok, beans cold and without any juice. The yuca was undercooked and oily. Salad bar was poor. Again was ok if you don't know the real taste. I hope they can improve. Send the chef to Brazil for a 5 day training camp. Good luck",

Amazing salad bar with a variety of veggies, cheeses, meats, soups, and entrees for you to eat in addition to the Brazilian style meat service.  The veggies are fresh and delicious and the area is always spotless.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  The food quality is excellent.  The meats are perfectly charred and seasoned and the server will cut you a portion depending on how cooked you like it.    Sides are great too.  We always get mashed potatoes, broccoli, asparagus, and the plantains.  I'm surprised more people don't go.  The price is actually very reasonable for any restaurant let alone one that serves you so much meat (expensive) and has the level of service they do.

The food is delicious and if there is something you want that they are not bringing around, all you have to do is ask and it will be table side in no time. The options on the salad bar are definitely more then just salad my family enjoyed the clams and the goat cheese stuffed jalapenos. The Parmesan and mozzarella bread they bring before your meal is very good and gluten free since it is made with yucca instead of flour. Must try, highly recommended!",

The servers and hostess and staff went out of their way to make sure we felt comfortable and knew what to expect. The salad bar was incredible! I could have just eaten that and been totally happy...except that the meat was amazeballs! First the salad and starters bar- great selection of veggies, bruschetta, dips, awesome cheeses and olives, pastas, and more. They kept the bar clean and stocked! There were a number of made to order sides too - we tried the asparagus, mushrooms, plantains, broccoli, fries, mashed potatoes and everything was very nicely cooked and seasoned. We ordered a bottle of wine to go with dinner - their selection was large, and the prices ran the gamut from inexpensive to crazy! The meat was, as I mentioned, amazeballs. We tried just about everything, and they were awesome about serving well done meat to my daughter and I and medium well and my son and hubby. Our favorites were Tri tip, New York strip and the lamb. Make sure you try the special of the day. Eight big thumbs up from our family!",

Managers came to ask us for specific items we want and ensure they come out quickly. We did not have to wait. Plates were replaced often since there are more than 16 kinds of meats to enjoy. Food - 5 stars. The steaks beats Sls, Lawrys many expensive steak houses on the strip and in the casinos such as Bellagio, Encore, Aria. I prefer this place over Texas the Brazil due to their very selective salad bar. You have to try the beef capaccio and many other items from the salad bar. Other steaks worth trying like NY, Tritip, Garlic steak, etc... they all come juicy, hot and delicious. I will never go to a regular steak house ever since their steaks will get cold half way due to the large steaks they serve. This is the inherent advantage of brazilian steak house. Ambience - 5 stars. It is cozy and family oriented. It is not a bar. We always feel very welcome here. This is our 5th time in 3 months.",

I have always felt that the energy is very frenzied at Texas de Brazil--they are always very crowded and interested in turning over tables.   Via Brasil never stopped trying to feed us and constantly made sure our experience was positive.  They pay attention to fine details.  For example, they periodically bring you a clean plate to start over with when you have meat scraps littering your plate.    The meat quality is excellent and the servers always tell you that if you aren't ready for a meat they have, they will be sure to bring it back around later.  Additionally, one person at my table wanted one last piece of filet at the end, and they fired up a fresh skewer of them, just for him.  We went without a reservation, which was refreshing.  GO to this place!  You won't regret it!",

Otherwise the meats were good. Some kind of bland. Salad bar was nice but don't bother eating too much over there and wait for all those meats. Earlier the better. It gets a tad crazy there and you have to wait for the good stuff. You can request something on the list but dont hold your breath. They never did get back to us once it started getting busier so we just paid and left. Was an experience but just ok. Lamb chops were my favorite.",

As soon as we enter we were kindly greeted by the hostess and taken to our table. Then as soon as we sat down the waiter was already filling our water glasses and welcoming us. We then made our way to the appetizer bar which is full of tons of different appetizers, soups, and salads. My favorite from the appetizer bar was the chicken marsala and the lobster bisque. Once, we were ready for meats they brought out so many different flavorful meats and all of them were exceptional ! Once we were so stuffed from all the food, they brought us out cheesecake with a candle in it and sang happy birthday. By far the best birthday dinner that I have been to. Since then, my mom and I go to their happy hour every other week and we absolutely love it.  Such an amazing restaurant and we absolutely love Anna!",

    "text": "I had a horrible experience there Sept. 26, 2013 during happy hour.  I was in a group of 25 people from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmeetup.com&s=077f03ca6fcbacbd8626f92bdc3557d252b3b93aff296ea2aa3ca0c4cf2ca2c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">meetup.com</a> that met there that night. Everything was going fine till at the very end as I finishing up my final drink.  We ran individual tabs and I already paid my tab.  Apparently because I was one of the last to leave the table I was accosted by a Via Brasil employee about someone else in the group whom I did not personally know who did not pay her tab and the employee demanded me to pay her tab.  I told him I already paid mine and I shouldn't be penalized because of a deadbeat I didn't personally know.  Then I started being treated like I myself was a deadbeat because the whole staff subsequently circled me and threatened the police on me if I didn't pay.  I looked around and noticed everyone else in the group was gone.  I had no choice but to pay and I ended up doing so by slamming the money to pay for the deadbeat's tab on the table and I let them know that they were over the top on me and they don't care about potential future business they could have received from me.  I let the group leader know by email about the experience later that night and the next day she did meet me and paid me back, which was nice.  Over the next several days I called Via Brasil to speak with the owner to discuss my bad experience because the staff was so hard up about collecting the money from me even if I did not personally owe them that money...I was told each time the owner was not there and I left messages that went unreturned.  The same occurred with an email I sent to the owner.  Via Brasil should be ashamed for hiring people who will use extreme measures to get their money even from people who don't personally owe a tab left behind by someone else.",

    "text": "**Summary**        - They bring by skewers of meat and cut it right in front of you.        - All the meats we had, with the exception of the lamb were perfectly cooked.        - The top four you must try, in order of deliciousness is Beef Ribs, Top Sirloin, Prime Rib, and the Grilled Salmon with Orange Creme Sauce.        - The garlic steak and flank steak were good, but a little bland comparatively        - The pork tenderloin with Parmesan cheese is another thing that you should try.        - Ones to avoid taking up unnecessary room in your tummy for the good stuff would be the Chicken Drumstick, Leg of Lamb, Beef Tenderloin wrapped in Bacon, Turkey wrapped in Bacon.        - Decor/Mood - Classy and expensive **Price**        - $42.95 for Rodizio Dinner **Ordered**        - Salad Bar               - Cheese Ravioli in Mushroom sauce - I usually don't like ravioli, but this was perfectly creamy and velvety               - Seafood Mix - All the seafood you'll find in paella without the rice/chicken/sausage               - Beef Carpaccio - Brio's is better               - Salad - I'm allergic to chloroplast so I didn't really try it        - Sides               - Mashed potatoes - Seasoned and salted perfectly.               - Cheese rolls - Who doesn't like cheddar biscuits.               - Broccoli               - Fried plantains - Best plantains I've ever had. Large, not too sweet, lightly crisp and not soggy.               - French Fries/Onion Rings/Asparagus by request only.        - Beef Ribs - So meaty, they cut you a piece off the bone. It's perfectly seasoned and is the only meat I had thirds of. It has just enough fat to melt in your mouth.         - Top Sirloin - My second favorite meat. However, the edge slices do tend to be a little salty. The inside slices are just right.        - Prime Rib - Very moist. One of the juiciest pieces of meat I've ever had. No homo.        - Grilled Salmon with Orange Creme Sauce - I usually hate cooked salmon, but the orange creme sauce was delicious. It must of been made with fresh oranges because it tasted like freshly squeezed orange juice, but as a creme.        - Flank Steak - Juicy, but a little bland next to the other meats.         - Garlic Steak - Same as the flank, but with a garlic flavor.        - Pork Tenderloin with Parmesan cheese - Thin layer of fried cheese around a normally bland meat. It was definitely something I didn't mind trying.         - Sausage        - Beef Tenderloin and Turkey, both wrapped in Bacon - Mostly just tasted like bacon.        - Leg of Lamb - A little dry, but it could of just been the piece I got.        - Chicken drumstick **Recommendations**        - I would definitely recommend this place for a nice evening out or a special occasion. The price is a bit steep, but you're paying for food and an experience.",

    "text": "They only get 2 stars because the owner needs to learn some serious people skills! I have eaten there twice, the first time was on a week night and there were only about 8 tables seated. Everyone bent over backwards for us, which I expected because they had the time to do it. We liked it so much that we decided to book their New Year's Eve Party. We were 5 minutes late to our 10:30pm reservation and then stood for almost 10 minutes waiting to check in because a large party was standing in the entryway. The hostess (turned out to be the owner) saw us standing there and ignored us. When we finally got to check in she told us that they had given our table away so we now had to wait. After waiting 10 minutes I asked how much longer it was going to be because we had been told the food service stopped at midnight. I couldn't understand her answer because the DJ music was so loud. When I told her this she started screaming at me that I could stop yelling at her and that if we didn't like it we could walk out because she didn't need people like us. When I tried to explain that I was speaking loudly because of the music she cut me off and screamed at me some more. The other hostesses and guests were in shock. So I decided to ask her name. Her answer was that she was the owner and I could call her the owner or I could get out. Since there were no other options for dinner at that point I asked how long it was going to be and she said she had to find somewhere to \"put us\". We were finally seated last after she seated 6 groups that came in after us. We reached our table at 11:05 and then sat for another 5 minutes before anyone came to the table. There were at least 5 open tables in the section we were in so it was pretty clear there shouldn't have been a problem \"finding somewhere to put us\". The hostess who did seat us apologized repeatedly for her behavior and said she was sorry there was nothing she could do. It was clear from our conversation with her and other staff during the night that outbursts like this are a regular occurrence and the staff are used to trying to make it up to guests who do stay and eat. I guess it should have been a warning when I saw her grabbing party favors out of a guest's hand and yelling at the woman that she could only have 1 item per person.  Our server was wonderful once he realized we were his table. However it was clear the staff bringing the meat around had no idea how to navigate a full restaurant. My plate was constantly empty and we spent half the night craning our necks trying to find the closest meat server. The salad bar was the usual which surprised me for a party that they were charging so much extra for. It is tiny compared to other Brazilian Steakhouses we have been to and both times they have hit a big pet peeve of mine. They put the salad dressing in front of the tray of salad so lettuce drops into it during the night. By the time we got to the salad bar the dressing was full of lettuce, which is a health code violation. It has happened both times we have eaten there, so it is clearly not something they care to keep neat. The meats were so salty that I had to ask for center cuts. And after being promised they were serving food until 1am, they stopped bringing meat around at midnight. They put out a dessert buffet at midnight. By 12:20 there were about 20 items left and they were all stale like they had sat out all day before being served. The worse part was they didn't have any more so several people didn't even get dessert which was included in the higher price for the party. We finally had to ask for more fried bananas. Once the server realized we hadn't gotten any dessert he brought us something from their regular menu.  The last thing that bothered me was on the check. The check had been rung up under a different server's name. When I asked about it we were told that our server was the \"second\" on a team and the name was the \"leader\" of the team. I asked where the leader was, and was told she had already left the floor for the night. I thought it was tacky that I was expected to tip a \"team\" of servers when only one person had spoken to us all night. I am not talking about leaving the bussers and such out. I don't think someone who never even spoke to me should get a tip from me. Especially someone who has already gone home even though we are still seated.  We won't be going back unless someone else is buying for certain. If you do go, make sure it is on a slow night so you get good service and pray you don't cross paths with the owner.",

Delicious!! Great wine selections too! The meat of course was varied in selection, perfectly seasoned, dripping with juices, tender as all hell, and some of it is wrapped in bacon. The service is perfect. I almost feel like they had too many people there to cater to my every whim. For about $50/person it's not \"cheap\", so go when you're hungry. When you leave you won't regret a single dollar you spent there.",

And here is my verdict....The salad bar at Texas de Brazil is better, fresher, tastier.  However, the meats at Via Brasil are superior to Texas.  The meats are not as fatty and just taste better.  My favorites were the prime rib, top sirloin and beef ribs.  Both atmospheres are very nice, clean, and beautiful.  Another observation I made was that the staff at Via (the waiters, the guys that cut the meat, the managers, hostess) were much more professional, courteous and all around nicer than the staff at Texas.  I really liked this place.  I went on a groupon so I ended up paying $50 for 2 people.",

The lamb was juicy tender and cooked to medium rare just how I like it thinking about that that is how all the meat is perfect in my mind much more flavorful than texas de brazil.

Our experience, my wife's first at a Brazilian steakhouse, was memorable, positive, and romantic. The quiet and relaxed atmosphere was well complemented by excellent and attentive service. The meats that were brought around were all excellent, but we both especially loved the bacon wrapped turkey. The selections on the salad bar were extensive, varied, and everything we tried was delicious. The chimichurri sauce must be mentioned, and was bursting with flavor. If there was a single downside as a visitor, it is that the restaurant is a good distance off the Strip, so the cab rides were expensive, but we left feeling it was money well spent",

    "text": "Went for Mother's Day Brunch, which was $34.99 each. It was okay, the only disappointments for me were their salad bar and the sides... both were just eh. Salad bar seemed small to me. Especially after my only other Brazilian Steakhouse experience being Fogo De Chao, which was absolutely mind-blowingly amazing. Anyway, Via Brasil's meats were delicious, and I didn't need any extra seasoning or sauce. The service was decent, and the restaurant itself looked clean and classy.",

    "text": "Valentines Day Dinner, Although we were seated on our reservation time, the wait for service was terrible. We were greeted and pretty much left alone after that. So we didn't have any drinks until we flagged the waiter 30 mins after we first sat.  The food was ok. Although we were there for quite some time, it was the same meat choices  (Brazilian sausage, Chicken Hearts, flank steaks) that came around.... Where was the Shrimp, Picanha, ribs, filet migon, NY strip, Prime Rib, Blackened fillet, other traditional Brazilian meats, etc? We accidentally spilled gravy  on the table and even though it was seen by some employees, they did not assist us.  We didn't even get a refill on drink unless we asked, and when we did, it would be at least 15 mins before we got the drinks. We were getting frustrated and so we just called it quits for the meats and ordered our desert, I actually timed it and it took 36 mins to get desert. With that's said, we went ahead and asked for our check as soon as we got our desert in hopes to get the check back sooner than later. We also noticed the table service was horrible, there was at least 3 to 4 tables that were empty for at least 30 mins or so. We started to wonder why they didnt clear the tables sooner as we saw the large crowd at the entrance waiting frustrated. In my opinion, I believe they had plenty of personnel working, I think the problem was with the leads or section managers not managing their folks.",
