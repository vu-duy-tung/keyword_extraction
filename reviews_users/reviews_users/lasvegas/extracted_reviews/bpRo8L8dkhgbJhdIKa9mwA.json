Through some terrific connections, I was able to get in pretty quick both times I've been here and have been extremely happy each time.  And what better location than the Cosmopolitan, making it a perfect pre or post-dinner drink location.  Had the petite filet mignon which was perfect, and can I say how good the creamed corn is?   In a nutshell:  great vibe, good music (it was 80s/90s night), mostly-trendy crowd, and most importantly an awesome meal.",

    "text": "Do not go with a party if 6 or more! My wife and I just had dinner with two other couples at STK. The food was good, exactly what you would expect for the prices.  However, the service was shameful! Half of our group ordered salads and they all came out together perfectly and were delicious. For the main course,  4 of us ordered steaks and the other 2 ordered a seafood platter. All of our steaks were brought out at the same time but the seafood platters were not included or mentioned. After about 5 minutes I was able to flag down a busboy and inform him that we were missing 2 dinners. It took him a few minutes to hunt down our waiter and a few more minutes to bring out the food. Now our steaks have been sitting on the table for over 10 minutes while we waited for everyone to be served. And to top it off the waiter hides from us for the rest of the night and never apologizes. But you can be sure that our bill included the 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more. I guess since our tip was locked in the service was not important.  I also want to mention the hostess Lily and busboy Rupert were very helpful and should  be commended, they were the only ones who cared enough to apologize.  To top it all off we were charged a $50 corkage fee. I know that this is the strip, but that is $20 -$30 higher then other comparable strip restaurants.  Finally, for the price, the service should have been much better.",

Luckily my gamble paid off and this restaurant was absolutely amazing. My fiancee and I each had steak, she had flank steak & I ordered the porterhouse. Both were cooked to absolute perfection and literally melted in your mouth. We also ordered a few sides, one of them being truffle butter, which we used on the steak which added to the perfection. The other two sides we ordered (macaroni & cheese & creamy spinach) were nothing short of amazing either.  I highly highly recommend this if you're looking for a perfectly cooked & amazing tasting piece of red meat!",

No waitresses ever asked us if we wanted drinks while we were waiting. I had to go ask after 20 minutes if we could get drinks. They told me yes and to look for the waitress myself. The whole 45 minutes we waited she didn't bring all of us drinks. Some of us didn't even get our drinks till we were seated at our table eating appetizers. The waiter was not helpful whatsoever. Also, our \"private\" table that we waited so long for was practically on top of the tables next to us. We couldn't talk to each other because the music was so loud. The food was absolutely incredible though and the girl at the front was very pretty. I will not go back because of the lack of service despite the fact that the food was delicious.",

Truly, everything about this place was phenomenal. The service was on point, the food was amazing and the atmosphere was so much fun, I mean, really, a DJ spinning at dinner? OK!  Our service was wonderful. We were checked on at all the appropriate times, our server was attentive but never pushy and clearly knew the menu very well.  I started with the shrimp rice krispies and then had the classic filet with a side of mac & cheese for dinner. Everything was amazing. I still can't get over the taste of the mac & cheese. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and literally melted in my mouth. Oh, and did I mention the bread? Yeah, amazing. We also had a few desserts to share with the table and as it was my birthday my dessert was jazzed up a bit! They were very good!  Finally, the atmosphere was so much fun and the people watching was phenomenal. I love people watching and there were lots of interesting and unique people to watch while dining at STK. There was also a DJ spinning but the music was kept at a very reasonable volume so that we could enjoy our dinner company.  I would definitely make reservations and recommend checking out one of the bars before or after in the Cosmopolitan!",

    "text": "STK  was a solid meal.  I loved the music which was old school stuff you could sing to.  We hung out in the bar after just to sing along with the music.  The place is beautiful, as you would expect in the Cosmopolitan. The beef tartare was actually pretty flavorful (which isn't always the case), their verson of tomato/mozzarella was luscious, their crab ravioli appetizer had a thick, yummy sauce.  Their bread was definitely one of the most inventive I've seen where it was warm out of the oven, you tore it off and had a sort of blue cheese pesto sauce for dipping.  The filet was cooked beautifully and we all agreed we loved it.  The sea bass special was cooked well, but it needed more of a sauce and more salt.  The truffle mac and cheese was slamming and the bok choy was surpisingly spicy.  The bread pudding dessert was also received well.  I would come back here anytime since it isn't just a steakhouse.  It has enough other types of food if you don't want to just eat a steak so it will satisfy a foodie and it has a fun atmosphere that got our night off correctly.  I wish more clubs had this type of music because it is way more fun than the typical house music.",

It was girls week in Vegas and my friend and I ordered the 20oz RIb Eye. It was super delish! Tender, juicy and delectable! We couldn't finish it! We also had the creamed spinach (super yum!!) and the mac and cheese which to be honest was pretty bland/boring. I would not order it again, nor would I recommend it.  We also had the special dessert of the night which was chocolate cake crumble and chocolate ice cream. Really good.   All in all, I will definitely try the NY location. When i am back in Vegas, I will probably go back, but there are other steakhouses I want to try. Price was fine, but I live in NYC so all the same to me. lol!  I will definitely try the sweet potato doughnuts next time! Enjoy Vegas STK if you want a party and good food!!",

The food all looked insane, but we decided on the salmon starter. YUM!! They also bring you this crazy cinnamon roll tear apart gig with warm icing to dip! Wth!  My husband had the steak and eggs which sounds so simple, but the steak was perfection and the potatoes super yummy! I had the pork belly Benedict with a ponzu hollandaise. AMAZE!! We had a bottle of Veuve served by their beautifully charming and knowledgable Som, Raquel. What a sweetheart! Our sweet server was Stephanie, darling and super helpful! She was assisted by Elmer who was an absolute doll!! Everyone so nice and professional..loved it all!  See you next time!!",

It was alright though since we were able to hangout by the bar, had some great drinks and enjoyed the ambiance.  Now the food. I really liked the complementary bread but I didn't think it was enough... maybe it was just cuz I was really hungry. I had the Colorado lamb chops, and man oh man that was definitely a winner. The meat was very tender and what I loved more about it was that their lamb didn't taste gamey at all. You can still tell it was lamb but it didn't have that strong lamb taste to it. We also got a couple of super delicious sides, the truffle parmesan fries, which comes in brick form, and the very creamy corn pudding. Oh yeah, and a plate of asparagus too, which was pretty much mediocre at best.   Overall, STK has it going on. The ambiance, people and food made our dinner worthwhile. By the way, the DJ was really good too.. if there was a dance floor I would've been on that real quick.",

    "text": "Appetizer: Foie Gras French Toast - $24 = this dish did not work for us. I've had my share of Foie Gras and was thoroughly disappointed. While you do get your money's worth, the thickness and chunkiness reminded me of three pieces of spam stacked on one another. Foie Gras is just so rich. It should be enjoyed as a delicacy, not a monstrosity. And while foie gras is typically served with toast. Being mixed with sweet french  toast and caramelized apples, was  like an episode of Jersey Shore - a hot mess with just too much going on.   Main Dishes:  7 Oz Skirt Steak - $25 12 Oz Skirt Steak- $32 -- for the quality of the steaks, not worth it. The dipping sauce reminded me of A-1. Really, nothing spectacular.   Sides:  Foie Gras Topping - $15 - Tip - this worked better with the steak. However, it was the same amount as the appetizer (2.5 ounces). Do yourself a favor if you do want to try the foie gras appetizer,  just order the appetizer and not the topping as well. you'll have more than enough to save some for the steak probably.   Truffle Fries - $10 -  the fries are extremely thick jenga style sized fries. I think truffle works better on shoe string fries. I could not really taste the truffle.   Mushroom Pot Pie - $10 - the server takes the fun out of a pot pie. I was excited to dig into it, but they go ahead and do the fun part for you. The server will cut the top open and spill the mushroom filling out and over the crust which will become a soggy mess. the little pastry you actually get was extremely salty.   Ambiance - Decor and service was great. Music is REALLY loud. Being a music lover and person who does not mind night clubs, I actually didn't mind. But I can understand how many people would be put off by this. So be forewarned: not a romantic or quiet dinner spot.   Overalll - great place to grab pre-dinner drinks/meet up with folks before headed out, but not a great place for an actual dinner.  If everything was about $5-$10 dollars cheaper, it would be okay.  Quality and price of food did not match up.",

Fortunately, I had fois gras as the steak itself was a bit dry and much closer to a full medium as opposed to the medium rare I ordered.  The biggest highlights were the sweet corn pudding side, it was absolutely incredible. Also, I'm not a huge dessert person, but the peanut butter pie was very solid and came with a variety of textures and sauces.",

Till next time.",

We made the mistake of going on a Sunday night, when, as the GM said to me, \"we like to get in the \"'hood\" on Sunday nights. So their annoying, pip-squeek of a DJ was spinning his foul mouthed gangsta rap music, which pounded our heads right out of this place.   They need a new DJ, and a new manager who promotes this crap. BTW, there were no customers we could see who where enjoying this \"music\". only the DJ was into it.   There are WAYYY to many other choices in Vegas to worry about STK again.",

    "text": "I ate here with my wife and her sister and brother in law the last time we came to vegas. We were given some food credit at the Cosmopolitan so we decided to use it at STK. We ordered the tuna tartare as an appetizer. It was pretty small to share for 4 people but is pretty good for 2. It tasted very delicious for the small portion it was. The house bread they offered was really good. For the main course, I ordered the bone-in rib steak. The steak was to die for. The steak was really tender and full of flavor. You didn't need to have extra sauces or toppings. It was fine as is. We also ordered the 3 mac and cheese side and also the brussels sprouts. The sides were pretty bomb! Just beware, the 3 mac and cheese side was around $55. It isn't on the menu but it was really good and glad we ordered it.  The inside of the restaurant is really nice. The decor is very modern. It is located inside of the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor. I'd definitely eat here again if I could. The steak was amazing and definitely worth trying!",

Service was really good. I liked the swanky and upbeat environment. So if you want a more relaxing and quiet setting this may not be your place.   Got the dry aged bone in strip, mashed potatoes, and crab tortellini. They crisped up the edges of the steak a little but other than that, that steak was delish.   The blue cheese tear away bread they select while you wait is bomb too. Loved this place. Reserve a table with confidence.",

We had asparagus appetizers that rocked too.    The atmosphere is off the charts.  The roof is Suede for goodness sake!  You can't stop rubber-necking the place because it is so modern and posh.  But don't bother giving them any special instructions such as \"It's my wife's birthday, can you bring something out with a candle\" because they might forget, like they did with me.  Our server was short with us, never smiled, and rarely dropped by our table.  We had to flag him down to get assistance, to ask for a different wine, and for our check.  It was embarassing.  I was trying to impress my wife and make this a special night.  STK blew that for us.  I spent $300 and wish I had gone somewhere else.  Honestly.  But the food was amazing, I will give them that.  I hope they read this and write me a reply telling me they are sorry for ruining my wife's surprise.  I was pretty bummed.  But the food was DELISH!!!! hahah  (no, it was - really - get the steak!)",

When we got to the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was the very chic vibe, hip music, and dim lighting. The energy in STK was very fun and exciting. We were seated shortly after arriving, but the first thing that came to our attention was the very cramped seating arrangements. My boyfriend was very uncomfortable since the tables were set very low (his knees easily hit underneath the table making any movement difficult).   We decided to start the night off with two glasses of Pinot Noir after noticing that the wine menu was extremely limited, which definitely surprised me. We then asked our waiter if he would take a picture of us, and he rudely told us he would do it later. The service was not up to par to say the least.   I ordered the Filet with King Crab Oscar. My filet was really good, but it was definitely not the best I've had. For sides, we ordered Bok Choy and Mac and Cheese with lobster. The Bok Choy had a nice, salty flavor; however, it was way too chewy to enjoy. The Mac and Cheese was probably some of the worst I've ever had. The flavor was horrible and there was one piece of lobster in entirety.   My boyfriend's Bone in Filet was very fatty once he got closer to the bone. He did like the flavor, but only half of the filet was edible due to all of the fat.   After dinner, we ordered more wine, along with cappuccinos and our waiter couldn't have been more thrilled to see that he had to continue serving us. He was pretty pissed.   I won't be in a hurry to return. It seemed that the workers were more worried about dancing and talking to each other than serving their diners.   Highly overrated!",

I extend my trip one more day and attend this amazing dinner. The skirt steak I had was cooked to perfection. Nicely seasoned and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Some of the apps were delicious as well. We ordered a bunch of desserts to try which were so so they actually eliminated some of the old school desserts I remember them having that were pretty delicious.

Granted it's an accident, but they didn't clean it up, the coffee started spilling off the table while we were waiting for someone to clean it up, I had to use my napkin to keep it from staining my dress. The service was not good, but since we were a group of 6 and the tip was included they didn't even try, it seemed like they were in a hurry to get us to leave. Definitely will not come again.",

Every bite just melted in my mouth. The vibe in the restaurant is fun and hip. Ppl were loving the music so much, some got up to dance! We did have one hiccup during our meal tho. One friend ordered the pork (I know who orders pork in a steak house) had to send the plate back twice because it was literally bleeding when he cut into it. Our server Brandon, who was very attentive and friendly, took care of it and took care of my friend by Comping his meal and a drink, which was expected.  When we left he gave us drink vouchers for everyone which I thought was above and beyond and much appreciated. Thanks for the memorable meal STK! Will definitely  be back.

    "text": "I love trying new steakhouses, so I had a lot of past experiences to compare to a new steakhouse experience. STK wasn't the best, but certainly not the worst. I quite enjoyed my experience there. The best thing I could say, it was an experience I have never had before at a steakhouse.  When I think of a steakhouse, usually it involves older white men as servers wearing doctor white coat, dark wood, calf skin or some type of homage to the steer, and the place is usually filled with business people or couples.  This place had none if those above!! It was like a club! It was very modern. There was a DJ, and people dancing around. It was hard to talk as the music was so loud. When you wait for your table at the bar, people may try to pick you up or some lady's boobs were on your face as you turn some other directions. Well, it is Vegas after all! So the atmosphere would be considered \"fun\" unless you hate clubbing.   I was there with my business associates and one more plus was this meal wouldn't cost me a penny. Before I knew it, wine was flowing, seafood tower and beef tartare were gracing the table. Yum yum yum.. All were delicious!  I ordered a regular filet with foie gras topping. I was pretty happy. The foie put it over the top for sure! I loved it but I had better tasting steak before. I wish I ordered the boned in filet but I was trying to not take advantage of the opportunity. After all, I already topped it with foie gras. It was rather cheap however, $12 for the topping. What a deal.  Some of the guys ordered the boned in filet and porterhouse. They seemed very pleased.  Next to our table, there was a paralyzed guy in an elaborate wheelchair. I guess he was a loaded poker champ that got injured from some accident. Around him, there were at least five scantily clad women dancing around him, worshipping him. They looked hired but whatever, he was having fun and good for him. It was quite a show for us too!  Lastly, our cool server bought our table a round of shots of 1942 tequila and he did the shot with us! How cool.. Never in my life.  So.. See...?! The experience at STK was nothing I have ever had. Not sure if I would go back though, as once is enough.",

It was seasoned well and the soy honey sauce really stood out.   Then for entrees my friends and I shared steak, lobster Mac and cheese, parm truffle fries, cauliflower gratin and the polenta fries. Everything was decently good but there is really nothing I would crave and go back for.   On another note, the ambiance is cool in the Cosmo so it gives the restaurant a nice vibe.

    "text": "My experience at STK was a disappointment especially because it came highly recommended by my coworker and the raving reviews I read.   Started out with not being able to book online because it kept saying \"reservation not available within 2.5 hours of your requested time.\"  Before giving up I thought it was worth a try to call the restaurant directly.  I was beyond thrilled when the host said \"yes we have a table available\"!!  On the day of my reservation we arrived 30 minutes early but we were seated promptly so that was good.  Our waitress Leslie was pleasant and helpful with giving recommendations.  We ordered and our food came out quick.  I estimated it took no more than 15 minutes after we ordered. We ordered the scallop for appetizer, the lobster Mac and Cheese, and broccollini for our sides, and I ordered the special of the day ribeye.  Although they told us to be careful the plate is hot, nothing on our table was \"hot\"!!! From the plate to our food!!! I mean it was \"warm\" but not hot!! I paid an extra $12 for the topping for my steak, and honestly that topping is included at other restaurants. But at STK you pay for the steak and the topping?!?! And as for the steak.... it was just OK.  The ambiance is just OK as well; Normal restaurant atmosphere.   The one thing I agree with most reviewers is that this restaurant is a $$$$ (four $ sign) because it's expensive.  For the money I spent, I am sure I can find a restaurant with better food in Vegas.",

    "text": "Nouveau riche 20 or 30 something or just wanna be a baller for a night?  STK has all the tools needed to make it happen.  An excess of foie, truffles, and caviar to golden bottles of Armand de Brignac Ace of Spades champagne; heck, there's even a live DJ to negate conversation (except for yelling or hand gestures) giving the excuse to text or checkup on one's social network fame.  Oh, the food is good.  Starters are upend takes on classics. The beef tartare packs a flavor punch, mixed with black truffle and served with peppery, sliced, crisp radish and a sweet and earthy soy caramel.  The flavors blend well.  The foie, indulgent.  Large slice, pan seared, served with almond brioche French toast and a sweet, woodsy, sherry gastrique brightened by tart apples.  Finally, one of the most decadent sliders (lil' BRGRs); American wagyu burger topped with foie and black truffles.  Pure decadence.  I'll leave the flavor to your imagination.  Good selection of steaks in different sizes and cuts.  Servers claim the beef is USDA prime.  Seems correct.  Good texture, marbling, well trimmed, good sear and properly cooked to temperature.  The Bone in rib steak, bone in fillet, and porterhouse excellent.  There is a selection Wagyu cuts.  Never tried them since their country of origin unknown.  Maybe the word \"Wagyu\" is baller enough?  Do not pass on the foie or truffle butter.  Both add a great flavor boost.  Tuck the compound butters under the steak so the heat releases the aromas trapped within.  Excellent.  Add a slab of foie and / or shaved truffles to kick up the flavors even more and increase the baller status.  Steakhouse standard sides.  All meant to be shared.  Very good wine list.  Passable service (it's difficult to communicate with the servers thanks to the music).  Simply put, it's Vegas baby.",

This was definitely a special occasion meal for us, and we kept it simple. Both of us enjoyed our steak thoroughly. i highly recommend getting the flavored butters for the steak - it adds a very special nuance to the meal that was delightful.   service was prompt and attentive enough, although it was very busy.  We do not drink so i cannot comment on the beverage selection, but i believe it was extensive.  The staff was very knowledgeable about all the offerings which i found pleasant. If i hit big, i would definitely go back here!",

It was True and I did feel bad for her - that's too many tables!   Moving on...the food was fantastic. The steaks were prepared perfectly and I also had a beet salad with a pistachio pesto that was probably the best beet salad I've ever had (and I get them every time I see one).

    "text": "Friend of mine and I ate at STK last Sunday in LV.  Other friends we were traveling with opted to catch a Beatles show elsewhere in town, and after hearing their \"review\" of that show, I know my friend and I had the better evening.  Two guys at a steakhouse for dinner, so it stays pretty basic:  drinks, salads, steaks and a few sides.  It was ALL GOOD at this place.  I'll admit to having some reservations based on prior reviews regarding the noise level in the restaurant, and am very pleased to say we didn't experience that at all.  Maybe those running STK have read the reviews and toned it down?  Granted it was a Sunday night, but it didn't seem like either the Cosmopolitan hotel or STK restaurant was particularly jumpin' that night.  We got a table right away, and were able to carry on a normal conversation throughout the dinner.  I started with the wedge salad while my friend had some kind of bibb lettuce roll-up special, and they were both good.  A pleasing amount of bleu cheese in my wedge, which I think is the perfect setup for our steak entrees that followed.  I had a large NY Strip steak, cooked perfectly medium rare, which my friend opted for short ribs, which he said were fantastic.  Our two sides were also terrific, a dish of sauteed spinach and another side of fingerling potatoes roasted in garlic.  I know the potatoes were all gone before we left the table, while there was some spinach left, but think that was more because our appetites were satisfied than anything else.  Couple of dirty martini's with bleu cheese stuffed olives over the course of the evening, and we were quite happy.  My friend picked up the tab so I didn't see the final tally, but I'd estimate easily $100 - $150 each, as I think everything was ala carte.  But I'd go to this place again in a heartbeat, next time in Vegas.",

    "text": "To celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday, we travelled to Las Vegas with two friends of ours. While there, I wanted to treat him to a stellar dinner and picked STK. I was a bit hesitant as a lot of reviewers have had mixed feelings and said that it's a loud spot for a nice dinner, but I'm really glad I went with my gut and picked STK. It wasn't romantic but definitely sexy.  When I made the reservation, I noted that our dinner was to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th. We arrived for our 8pm reservation time but were told that they were running behind and it would be about 25 minutes, so we were welcome to get a drink at the bar. (I suspect they tell everyone this to beef up their liquor sales.)  We were actually seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by our very pleasant server. For dinner we picked the shrimp rice krispie squares, macaroni and cheese and the much-recommended mushroom pot pie. I ordered a filet medallion and he had the 16oz. striploin. All was incredibly delicious - especially the mushroom pot pie! It was to diiiiiie for!  While my boyfriend was in the washroom, I asked our server if we could get a dessert with a candle and she responded \"yeah of course - it's your boyfriend's 30th birthday, right?\" I was stunned! For the restaurant to pay attention to that reservation detail, remember it and relay the message to our server was highly impressive.  Apart from the food and dessert, we also had wine and cocktails. The selection is solid but not overwhelming.  While the noise level isn't exactly \"intimate\", STK had a lively vibe with most-excellent tunes. Every song that came on excited me, including '80s Madonna, UB-40 and even Tom Cochrane (being a Canadian, I was stoked). My only complaint might be the hostessing staff - there was something about their attitude that left a sour taste in my mouth, so thankfully the rest of our STK experience more than made up for it!  At the end of the day, we would most definitely find ourselves at STK again. It's not your everyday place to grab dinner (for the two of us for two glasses of wine, one martini, two steaks, an appetizer, two sides and a shared dessert it was $220 with tip), but most certainly worthy of special occasions. Believe the hype.",

I think the overall Yelp Rating might be low because of the price, but this place is not any more expensive than other steakhouses or upscale restaurants... and for Las Vegas, it is very reasonably priced.",

    "text": "For me at least, a decent steakhouse and a nice element of the array of restaurants in the Cosmopolitan.  Pros: -The menu is pretty customizable. This means that if you know what you like and want, you can get it, and if you don't, you'll probably end up picking something that doesn't hit the spot for you. They divide the cuts of meats into small, medium, large, and \"special\" categories, and to those you can add your choice of rubs/special add-ons (I chose to get my skirt steak peppercorn-crusted, for example). Then you can order sauce to go with it as well (horseradish!) -Sides were also surprisingly tasty...the green beans were a hit at our table, despite everybody thinking we got them just because we needed vegetables -Great service  Cons: -Will cost you a bit. This is more expensive than the average nice steakhouse in other cities (as you'd expect) -They will enforce their dress code to some degree...which is a bit surprising given that you see people in all sorts of attire on the casino floor one floor down. They'll stop you if you're wearing swimwear, and you're walking the line if you're in shorts and flipflops -For some reason they turned the music up pretty loudly in the middle of dinnertime, to the point where it felt like a club, given the very dim lighting. -The \"special\" dishes sound absolutely amazing, but a couple people at our table got the wagyu (the \"less expensive\" special, which was still ~$100 a plate), and the portion size was almost laughably small (which I guess is what you get for ordering something \"premium\" in Vegas)",

I am not exaggerating when I say that our waiter had to *yell* at us.   That said, all the food we had was great. My rib eye was cooked perfectly and super tender. The mashed potatoes were excellent as well. Despite having to scream, the service was very good, too.   I wouldn't go back, but if you don't mind really excessively loud environments while you eat, you'll get some very good food. Prices are ridiculous, but I guess that's to be expected at a Vegas steakhouse.   (one small other thing... 'full bar'? No. They have no draft beer! Which seemed to be really common in Vegas. I mean, its a steakhouse, so I'm having a nice cabernet anyway, but why no draft beer? If I want beer I have to have a $9 bottle of Blue Moon? Maybe it's because I'm from Portland and live in SF... but I expect good restaurants to have a few good drafts. Some micro-brews or a nice Belgian or SOMETHING!)",

When we sat down, I could feel the very vibe and trendy atmosphere and listen to the very cool music in the background.  For starters, we had their warm bread with cilantro dipping sauce and their shrimp rice krispies bisque.  Their bread was super yummy........and the shrimp bisque was awesome......a thick creamy bisque with a spicy kick.  Just as good as the Palm's or Craftsteak's lobster bisque  For dinner, we had their bone-in rib eye steaks and sides of creamed spinach, corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and truffled fries.  The steaks were perfectly cooked and prepared.  The sides were all excellent, especially the corn pudding.  For desert, we had the coconut up-sidedown pineapple cake......totally awesome wiith a wonderful coocnut/pineapple blended taste.  Overall....I loved STK.  I normally do not enjoy these  trendy steakhouses that are full of fluff and short on substance.  STK is a trendy, hot steakhouse that cooks steaks like the old boys do!",

Shame on us for ordering it without asking the price, shame on them for serving a little white ramekin dish of mac n cheese with very little lobster and charging $50.00!!!

The food was delicious, but our server Beccs (Rebecca) deserves most of the credit for our experience.  She was extremely personable and had great recommendations.  She let us try the wines that she suggested before committing which I always appreciate and hit it right on based on what we said we liked.  She also didn't steer us to the most expensive as other servers tend to do.  She came off as very geniune and made us feel like we've been friends forever.   We will surely be back!",

To sum it all up, everything we ate and drank I could have prepared at home for quarter of the price and better service. No one came to our table for over 10 minutes upon first being sat. I ordered the medium sized filet medium rare, which was bland, over cooked and dry as ever. My husband ordered the bone in ribeye which was slightly better prepared but not worth the money overall. The Mac and cheese was probably the best thing we ate but we ended up sending back the broccoli as it was cold, dry and bland. When I asked the waiter to send it back, he said he agreed their veggies lack in taste so he was unable to make a better recommendation for a replacement. I don't get it- what are you going to pay $15 per side for cold and tasteless veggies? Again, I could have prepared all of this at home for wayyyy less money. For the price, so not worth it- really wish we would have gone elsewhere given all the options. Very disappointing- don't waste your money!!!",

Food: We started off with a seafood platter that had oysters, scallop ceviche (my personal fave),and shrimp. Then came the sliders, yellowtail sashimi, and this mushroom ravioli dish.. All really good! By that time I was honestly really full lolll! Then the steaks came and OMG the fillet Mignon was AMAZING!!! They also gave us an array of sides but my personal favorite was this corn dish... I don't remember the name.. but the best way I could describe would be a crossover between mashed potatoes and cream corn. For desserts they served us with a cookie skillet with ice cream, flourless chocolate cake, and doughnuts.. the doughnuts was the better one out of the two.   Service: The service is amazing! Our waiter was so attentive and made sure our table was always clean! Chef Hopcraft did amazing job! I highly recommend this place!",

My husband and I want to some day try all the reputable fine steakhouses in the city. I even have a top 3 y'all!!!! I'm so torn because I don't want to boot any of my current top 3 spots, so I decided I'm going to have a top 4 favorite lol. This now includes STK!!  I love how intimate the seatings are. We were able to cuddle up around our dinner. Our waiter was on top of everything, as we usually expect in these nice restaurants. I usually don't like how dim it is at restaurants, but the highlighted halo that drops perfectly to illuminate the center of our table was perfect lighting.   We ordered a medium 22oz bone in rib eye, their mashed potatoes (forgot their name for it), sauteed mushrooms, king crab legs (opted for the warm, drawn butter version), half a dozen of oysters, and the sticky toffee pudding. You guys this was the other night, and I am still mesmerized.   The perfectly flavored and charred of the steak to it's perfectly cooked in medium state - amazing! The king crab legs were so thick and juicy, when dipped in butter and splashed with lemon juice, was just a delightful, pleasant gift for my taste buds and my body as a whole. The oysters were so fresh and sweet. Mashed potatoes weren't anything extravagant, but the sauteed mushrooms made up for it.   Lastly, for dessert we had the toffee pudding. Dessert is my favorite meal, and this is by far the best dessert I've had my whole life lol. Omg i sound extra, but that is my opinion. The warm, sticky toffee base with this gooey, chocolatey, toffeeish, cake on top, then this nice scoop of freshly made sweet cream ice cream as a topping was just all so decadent and well-balanced.   We are definitely referring everyone here, and coming back again and again in the near and far future.",

Our server, Brandon, came through big. The fact this is even a three star review is a testament to his level of service.  This is not your traditional steak house. It is more of a club combined with a steak house. It is loud and full of energy. The music helps. I enjoy the break from the normal experience.  As always the food was good. The bread and appetizers were all tasty. For my meal I ordered the filet with foie gras. The filet was prepared as requested and was satisfying all on its own. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. The foie gras gave it even more flavor and depth. It is by no means necessary, but well worth it.  For our sides we chose the creamed corn and the creamy yukon potatoes. The potatoes were good, but the cream corn was the star. You just never expect much from creamed corn, but it was fantastic.  I chose the STK donuts for my dessert. They were quite good. I was stuffed and did not need them, but I certainly enjoyed them.   This place should easily be a four star or better. I can handle being sat up to fifteen minutes late, things happen. Forty five minutes is unacceptable. Because of our server i will go back again. He came into a bad situation and made the most of it.",

    "text": "Tried out this steakhouse during my Vegas trip last weekend. Made reservations for 2 on a Sunday around 730 and we were seated within a few minutes of arriving.   The ambiance is different than most fancy steakhouses. It is definitely a Vegas style restaurant as there is upbeat music playing in the background with dimmed red and blue lights throughout. Nothing to complain about when it comes to the service as we had people passing by every couple of minutes either checking in, refilling our drinks, or handing us our food. You feel like you are really being taken care of.  My boyfriend and I decided to share the rib eye steak and portion wise it was just right for the both of us. We honestly could have eaten a little less. We topped it off with the truffle butter and flavor wise it was perfect. Pretty good marbling on the steak with just the perfect amount of char. We love getting steak medium rare and I would say that my only complaint with this steak is that towards the center, it tended to get a bit too chewy for my liking. Ultimately not the best steak I've ever had.  The lobster Mac and cheese on the other had was pretty amazing. The perfect amount and cheese and cream in this dish that there wasn't a single flavor that overshadowed the others. There was a good amount of lobster in the dish that was cooked to be the perfect texture and not too tough.    The truffle fries were good too. If you like more shoestring type of fries this is not the side for you. There are about 10 pieces of fries that are thick and square shaped. It was too much potato for me but it didn't lack in flavor. You can see in the picture I post how thick these fries are. Overall 3.5 stars for the steak but since both the lobster Mac and cheese and our service was outstanding I gave the place 4 stars.",

    "text": "My review might be a bit biased because I'm not typically the biggest fan of steak (came here with someone who is). First off, the complimentary bread was very unique and delicious, and it definitely rivals the best bread I've had at a restaurant. We got the lamb chops and a 10 oz. steak as well as sides of the grits and the truffle fries. For the appetizer, we shared a beef tartare. The tartare was wonderful, definitely above average among all the tartare I've tried. The lamb chops were good, and my date seemed to really enjoy his steak. The grits were very good, and went well with our meat. However, the truffle fries were average - the flavor of the truffles did not infuse into the fries but merely coated the top. The service and ambiance were also very good - typical of a nice restaurant.   I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the astronomical price tag. For the price, I feel 4 stars is fair.",

The down side and only reason why I didn't give a full 5star was because our dinner reservation was at 830 and we didn't get seated till 930. Also management as well as the hosts did not seem very friendly at all. One of the managers walked past us almost knocking on of my girls over from bumping into her and he didn't say sorry didn't turn around just kept walking away. When we asked how much longer for a table they kept saying about 10more mins. But it took a lot longer.   I was getting irritated special because I felt at that point customer service was horrible. However, once we finally were seated the waiter was amazing!! If I can find a receipt and get his name I will edit the review to add his name in. He was very friendly, attentive, and fun!   And again food was DELICIOUS !",

You must order steak! A ton of appetizers Two ribeyes Two filets Two sea bass  Accompanied with lobster Mac and cheese Lobster mash potatoes And the house bread they serve was a big hit two!  Service:  Our server suggested that we just order two of all the sides as well to make sure we have enough and it was perfect. He made sure to have half the neat prepared medium and the other half medium rare and it was placed on the table in a way that we would know which was which.   If you're having a birthday make sure someone orders the dessert with sparklers because it's not a party without them! It was a total surprise and we were the center of attention!

Not only is there their staff super friendly and accommodating, their food is absolutely delicious! The complimentary bread they give before your meal begins with their house made chive oil was the start of something new and different. I have never had anything like their chive oil before. It is so good and inspires me to make some on my own! went on yelp to see what foods looked yummy and wanted to try the bone in rib-eye steak, cut, medium rare. It does not disappoint. Our waiter recommended the mushroom pot pie and the rich creamy mushroom sauce was heavenly.   I almost forgot the best part. The beef carpaccio with pesto pasta in the middle is probably the best thing I have ever had in my life. It was very different, very beautiful, and very very delicious. Finally, the strawberry pistachio cake with ice cream was so good I almost cried.   I had such a great dining experience here at STK. If you want to try something different, that has quality, and will leave you feeling very satisfied, then I highly recommend STK. The food, our waiter, and the ambience surpassed all of my expectations. I felt very relaxed, comfortable, and full after my meal. Thank you STK. I'll be coming back again!",

We will give it a second chance because of this and hopefully have a better experience!! Thank you for your customer service !!!   This was an OKAY STEAK HOUSE . I order a medium sirloin and the steak was charbroiled on top when I didn't request it. I sent it back and received another steak and it was done right but not too much flavor!

I didn't care so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. The bar was filled with trade show guests. (I mean we were lucky to find seats, people were literally hovering over us) I then realize it's 7:50 and we still haven't been sat. Mind you we had show tickets at 9:30. I then went to the host desk, not angry, but worried that we might miss the show. The manager Bryan then let me know as soon as a 2 top become available we're the first on his list and he'll come grab us personally. We decided to just order the food at the bar and hope for the best with our table. The bartenders could tell we had been waiting a long time and offered a round on them. Almost 15 min later Bryan came to get us and informed us the meal was on him and he had a table ready for us. It was a smooth process transferring the bar order to the table and the server was informed of the situation without us having to tell her. Normally I would be pretty upset having to wait an hour for a reservation already made but I felt completely taken care of and heard by Bryan as well as the two bartenders that never once rushed us to leave the bar. The food was excellent and I expected nothing less. I'd like to go back just maybe not on a night so busy.",

The environment was fun, interactive and had a great setting.  The quality of the food was superb. I had the 10 oz rib eye and it was cooked to perfection.  The meat had a crusty outer layer and then it was really tender inside. Amazing flavor too!!!  My wife had the lamb chops entree and they were also cooked to perfection with great flavors.   The negatives were that there was no sides with my steak that came included in my plate. My plate was around $60.00 and it did not come with a side lol.  I think I would of loved it if they would of even thrown some steak fries on my plate to not make it look sooo empty.  Instead, they through some light garnish in the corner of my plate to add some color to my steak.  Each side averaged $15-20.00. I had to order a salad just to have my brain think it was having a fine dinning experience and to not leave hungry. The only reason i am not giving it a 5 star experience is because of the overall price I paid for the amount of food.  I paid $235.83 for the lamb chop entree, 10oz plate of rib eye and a salad.  My wife had a glass of wine and I had two Glasses of whiskey.",

The atmosphere is always upbeat w the music and people watching or what celeb is sitting next to you is a norm. Staff makes you feel like you have been coming for years from the start with the hostess to your server. Date or party this is the steak House to experience.",

    "text": "STK is located in the Cosmopolitan and dining here is like eating dinner in a straight up club. It's pretty dark, there's a DJ in the corner, scantily dressed girls dancing in the bar, and people even dancing in their chairs. If you don't want to talk to your date, friends, server, etc., but you want to dance in between courses, then I highly recommend STK.  We arrived around 7pm on a Monday night thinking we could just walk in, but we were dead wrong, and didn't get seated until 9:15pm. Pretty insane, but that's Vegas for ya.  Ambiance aside, the food is decent, but pricey. We started with their house made buttery garlic bread, drenched in cilantro oil and bleu cheese, which was delicious and hot upon arrival. Five mins later, it had cooled and became hard as a rock. We both had the skirt steak, cooked a perfect medium rare, and shared sides of foie gras and truffle fries. The foie was super rich, and the truffle fries were cut extremely thick. Overall, we were happy with our meal, but could've done without the long wait and the club-like atmosphere.",

It almost has the vibe of a low key club, but while eating dinner. Very fun. The food is great too. Our table split a salad to start and it was a good size for 4 people. I ordered the small skirt steak for dinner and Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as sides. Of course it is a little pricey, but all good steakhouses are. So so good!",

Hire a DJ to pump loud music throughout the place to simulate a club atmosphere. Because I always want to savor an expensive meal while lip reading companions at my table. Because I always wanted to experience bass tones vibrating my organs while I try to enjoy a meal. It's a challenge. It's different!  Look, I'm obviously not the right demo for STK Las Vegas. I'm 50, and I love good food. I want to enjoy a quality steak without it vibrating off the plate. To each his own.  The food was OK, the service great but I just couldn't hear what all the praise was about.",

Had the restaurant give my son a dessert with candle for his BD. The Manager of the restaurant came and introduced herself and wished him a great BD. The service was impeccable as well as the food. The crowd surrounding us also sang Happy Birthday, which was freakin awesome too. I would definitely come here again for a Fantastic Meal!!",

I took my teenage son before a concert and he loved it. The steak was cooked perfectly ! We had the yellowtail crudo and crab legs as an appetizer. The yellowtail is delicious ! It was wrapped around green apple matchsticks with hearts of palm and fennel on top !  For a side we indulged in the Mac and cheese which is one of the best I've ever had.   Can't wait to come back !  Monday nights with DJ Mike Attack are my favorite !",

I came with a triple bachelorette party (12 girls total) and made a reservations one month in advance for our big group. Our reservations were @ 10pm, we came a bit early since we were staying @ the cosmo but they didn't take us back until about 10:20pm. It was fine, some girls were restless (us small girls get hungry!) We had a nice big booth in the back that fit the 12 of us. The booth beside us had 6 guys, who nicely sent over $500 of booze to our table (whomever ya'll are we greatly appreciated that!). The food and portions were lovely and everything tasted great! Our server was very nice and kindly took his time with our orders and serving our table. We all loved the music! So many great old school classics! Definitely can't wait to take my fiance here, he would love it! Great restaurant, small or big groups welcome!",

Pacing was awful.  We waited 15 minutes to get water.  We waited another 10 minutes after order wine.  The time from the time our salad plates were taken away to the arrival of our entrees was pushing 45 minutes.    This was a Wednesday night at 9:30 p.m.  It was not busy.  I would never eat at STK on a weekend.    The other thing that I have to mention is that this is a reasonably large restaurant with a single, private bathroom for men and a single, private bathroom for women.  I don't know how that meets building codes--but if you go to STK and have to use the restroom, do yourself a favor and leave the restaurant.  There are large public bathrooms just across the hall.  You will save yourself time and frustration...and you'll be waiting forever for your food, so you might as well get in a little exercise.",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night. Made phone reservations -- only slot was for 10:45pm. Given that we were staying at the Cosmo, decided to stroll by and see if we could push it to 9:00pm, and voila~ done.   1. Oh. My. God. This place is unnecessarily loud. Music is blasting like you're in a club - takes away from the food (which, btw, is DELISH (see 3., below)).  2. Service was awesome.   3. FOOD IS DELISH (but see 1., above):   a) Bread: soft, moist, and cutely-shaped;  b) Oysters: yum, can't go wrong;  c) Filet and Ribeye: YUM, perfectly cooked as requested (medium) (FYI, they bring out an assortment of sauces for your meat -- never used them, but thought it was neat);  d) Mac and cheese: pasta shape threw me off (very short tube-shape); other than that it was delicious; e) Mashed potatoes: creamy yumminess; and f) Asparagus: meh, these were so-so and under-seasoned. They throw on a weird butter cream on top that doesn't add anything, except fat to your thighs.   4. Our table was too small for what we ordered, so our waiter used our forks as tongs, grabbed our filet, and placed it on our ribeye plate -- is this normal? (Also see 5., below).  5. Our steak came out cut in strips -- is this normal? (Also see 4., above). Maybe our waiter thought we were sharing (?).   6. People are not dressed for a fancy shpancy steak dinner. There are dozens of hooched out girls at the bar in club attire and 5 inch heels.   CONCLUSION: (1) I'd come here again for the food; (2) I could do without the excessively loud music; and (3) I'd never bring my parents here.",

Our server was clearly a professional in every way. Her recommendations and description of the menu items couldn't have been any better. We took her up on the drink and side dish recommendations, including the truffle fries which were out of this world. My 10oz filet was cooked to perfection, exactly as I had ordered.   I have one complaint: My boyfriend ordered a GLASS of house red wine. $21?! For house?! That's ridiculous. My vodka drink was $18, which is steep but marginally understandable. But $21 for a glass of house wine? Screw that.   We were never rushed, courses were timed appropriately. Yea, it's not cheap, but it's worth every penny, IMHO.",

We came 5 girls for their monday night comped dinner + 1 drink, you just pay a tip of $15-20 each which of course is great. However most of the food were half cooked sliders w/ground beef and the salmon. It seems like everything was cooked in a rush. Not sure if it was because the dinner was comped but I wouldn't come back here again to pay full price for a meal.",

    "text": "I would say, you either hate it or love it. Why hate it? Because its just steak after all, and I can get a good steak any city so why should I pay the price? Well here is the skinny:  I  personally loved it.   If you are an absolute steak fanatic, STK might seem overated, you could probably argue that for the same money or cheaper, you can get the same thing in (insert your city here) easy. The steak was good, however, and the sides were even better. Not the usual potatoes.   If you are into formal service \"Good afternoon sir\", white linens, traditional service that comes with steak houses, this is not the best place for you. The waitstaff here are awfully contemporary /modern, not informal or casual like quacky and annoying, just..contemporary and unfussy for what is normally associated with pricey steakhouses. They have a way of putting you at ease.  If you are into atmosphere - this is the place to go. Its like a club with steak on the side. The music is pretty much like Marquee, Top 40 messed up into electronic, the DJ plays Loud, libations are good all around, and you get pumped up without having to go to a club if thats your thing.  There are no cheap restaurants in the Cosmopolitan, in my opinion, so you're dropping at least $50 a person before tax any which way. Most people would edge toward $100 per person after all said and done. A small steak and a drink for two people ran $150 after tax and tip at this place. Was it worth it? It made for a fun evening, so I can recommend.",

The hostess selected a really crummy table, but there were lots of other better tables available, and the place was not busy at all.  Having none of that, I asked for a better table and got a little better one.  The thing is, they seat you cheek by jowl, and it isn't comfortable, and certainly doesn't seem like fine dining.    Atmosphere?  Granted, it was still early, but there was no DJ playing, and the place seemed dead.  Under those conditions, the concept of this place doesn't work.  It felt like eating at CPK at the mall.    The food?  The food must be amazing, right?  Not so much.  The food was in the ballpark, but I've had better at lots of places.    The service?  Apart from the clueless hostess, the service was good.  The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing.  They handled the meal fine.   All in all, I'm in no hurry to return to STK Las Vegas.",

We had a reservation at 730 and was not seated until 8...that is my biggest pet peeve. Why make a reservation if you show up 5min before and are not seated until well after your reservation time? The music is loud and anything but relaxed...our waiter wasn't that friendly to start and seemed to get annoyed when we asked him to repeat himself because we couldn't hear a thing! I am not a fan of having to get up close and personal with a stranger to order food. We spoke to a manager who was extremely professional and seemed to have a lot of practice with dealing with the noise level complaints...yes I get it that it's vegas and restaurants are loud. Our appetizers seemed to take forever. They were worth the wait though. Seemed to be that this place relies on the food to make up for a unpleasant atmosphere. My steak was perfect and sides were great. I haven't decided if I would return but if you are someone who likes a loud club like scene with food by all means...I think there are better places to eat more my style.",

The decor is dark and sexy with quite a good music selection. We started off with the seafood tower. The freshness was unbelievable. We asked the server for his recommendations and we decided to go family style with the Seabass, Chicken, Short Ribs and Bone in Ribeye. All were made to perfection. We also had the spinach, truffle fries and cauliflower. I would recommend those sides to anyone. We didn't get to try the Mac and cheese but I will definitely be back for that. We were told Monday nights it was the place to be and we definitely were not disappointed. I will be coming back more then once in the future. The best part of the meal is that the managers were walking around the room greeting the customer and giving the personal touch. That touch will make me recommend STK to anyone I know.",

We sat at our table  20 minutes before we even knew who our waiter was and another 5 minutes before he came back to take our order.  My husband's steak was over cooked, the waiter came back once to check on us, and then he never came back again until we waved him down to get our bill. The music is so loud you could hear what one another was saying, the table next to us was yelling in order to be heard by one another which was annoying. It was the worst dining experience ever!!!! My Daughter came into town the next night not knowing we went to STK the night before,  She went to STK, She shared this with me the next morning at coffee. Another horrible experience, she and her friend ordered all appetizers asking that they come out one after another but they brought them all at the same time and again the music was a problem way TOO LOUD!!! Her friend said I can hear anything your saying. They left never needing to return. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!! IT APPEARS THEY WANT TO GIVE THIS RESTURANT THE NIGHT CLUB VIBE.

It's a total bar setting with people hunched over tiny tables cutting into their steaks. The meat is decent but also very expensive. The sides which you have to pay for separately are very small and bland. Also the drinks are the same price as they are downstairs at Marquee, yes...$500 for a bottle of Goose. Really? Why?",

    "text": "I walked into STK around 845pm on a Thursday night and the place was busy. The bar was full and the wait was about an hour.  The restaurant is very trendy, \"yuppie\", and a typical Vegas restaurant. By this I mean you walk in and the 16 year old hostess is dressed in a mini skirt and hooker heels acting as if she's doing you favor by putting your name on the waiting list.  The entrance/bar area was blaring with Top 40/Alternative/Techno music which I thought was probably only confined to the bar area, but I thought wrong.   When we were seated the music only got louder, thats when I noticed there was a DJ in the middle of the restaurant (only in Vegas). It was quite difficult to enjoy my $50 steak and glass of Pinot Noir with My Chemical Romance blaring over me. I definitely wouldn't describe this restaurant as an intimate setting.  My conversation at the table was minimal or straight yelling at one another.  The reason why I gave this establishment 3 stars, versus 2 is because the food was actually very good. Fresh baked bread with blue cheese melted on top is served with this basil/garlic? infused oil. It took awhile to get our bread, but well worth the wait.  I ordered the 12 oz. bone-in rib eye  medium rare and man-friend ordered the skirt steak, which both came out perfectly cooked.  The sides are ordered separately family style.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery, I highly recommend it if you like it smooth, no lumps. Service was friendly and casual, with the exception of the hosts.  Awesome food, ok service, but I wouldn't recommend this place if you want to converse with the people at your table.",

    "text": "Went here the other weekend to try since my friend who lives in Vegas made a reservation for our group since we were going to hit up Marquee that night.   1) Food I have to admit, the food is pretty good here. I had a bone-in rib eye that was cooked almost perfectly medium rare. The taste was excellent too but the consistency could have been just a bit less chewy(I'm used to eating rib eyes that melt in your mouth.) I also had a caesar salad which was a couple wedges of lettuce mixed with caesar dressing and light cheese. It was exactly how a caesar salad should be, the dressing was not over powering and was not too sour and the lettuce was crisp. We also had the mac and cheese which was really good, but it was a bit sweet for mac and cheese. I don't need that much sugar in my mac and cheese. We also had the brussell sprouts which were just OK, nothing special. The restaurant also gives some kind of bleu cheese bread with dinner, and although I do not like bleu cheese, it really does not taste anything like bleu cheese, but the olive oil dip that comes with the bread is really really good. The bread by itself was just OK but with the olive oil it was excellent. Lastly we received three different plates of dessert because my friend knew the GM. The dessert was excellent, one plate had three types of cheesecake, the second had a couple different types of mousse and creme brulee, and the third plate had some kind of apple cobbler with captain crunch and vanilla ice cream which was outstanding. The captain crunch was interesting but it actually worked with the dessert!   2) Ambiance This has to be the loudest restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.  It is basically a club with a restaurant built inside it. I didn't see the club speakers as they must have been well hidden but the music was really really loud. So loud that you have trouble hearing people at your table, even the person sitting next to you. Our waiter even got one of my friends orders wrong because he heard him wrong. The DJ who was playing the music, his booth was right behind our table which was kinda funny. Some of the music was questionable, such as Informer by Snow, or Blow the Whistle by Too Short, and some other ghetto rap. He might as well have played Jump by Kriss Kross and Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice.  Don't get me wrong, I was born a hip hop fan and DJ but I don't really want to eat a $100 meal with bass shaking my table and chairs with music so loud that I speak less at dinner because I don't want to have to shout at my friends just so they can hear me.  If the music was about 5 - 10 decibels lower, I think it would have been much better.  Overall, it is definitely worth trying for the food.  Just be prepared to yell at your friends so they can hear what you are saying.",

    "text": "The Setting:  Group dinner Saturday night, no res (but had a Vegas hook-up in our group), sat after ten minutes.    The Vibe:  3.5 Stars True to the theme at Cosmopolitan, this place is swanky.  Fancy finish out, pretty people, and music that is a bit too loud for dinner.  I assumed the loud music had to do with the hour, but some guests that were leaving as we arrived said it had been loud the whole time.  Seemed a bit aggressive, even for a restaurant one door down from Marquee...  The Food:  3 Stars (Appetizers), 5 Stars (Entrees) This is literally the first meal I've ever eaten where the entrees outshined the smaller bites by a big margin.  It is usually the other way around! The GOOD:  1.  10oz Filet, Truffle Butter topping - melted in my mouth, amazing!  One of the better steaks I have had in my life, yet it was topped by.... 2.  14oz Bone-in Ribeye, Foie Gras butter topping - If I could rate something 6 stars, this would get it!  Our friend who got it gave us each a bite, and then had to fight us off stealing the rest of it.  I got one more a couple more bites to evaluate for this review, but didn't need them.  The entire table was salivating, and they liked their own steaks!  Perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked (medium rare - ), it was worth every penny and probably more. 3.  Dover Sole - got strong reviews from the group even though we wondered why he ordered a non-steak... The OK:  1.  Foie Gras French Toast - nothing against this dish itself.  The Foie Gras was quite good and the toast tasted fine.  But getting about 3 bites of it for $24 was pretty much a waste. 2.  Caesar Salad - our buddy didn't care for it, his friend who tried it said it was nothing special.  The Service:  4 Stars This would have been 5 stars if he hadn't messed up one guy's drink and another guys after-dinner drink order.  Water glasses were kept full, he was highly knowledgeable about the menu, and he basically got carte blanche for any mistake he might have made just for recommending the bone-in ribeye with teh foie gras butter.  The Bottom Line:  If you don't mind the music/ambiance being loud, this is a great steak place, honestly one of the best I've ever been to.",

If you have an issue with it why are you in Vegas?! This place was great! The hostesses were friendly and very pretty i might add. We got sat and our server was amazing. She was a pretty blonde. We ordered an array of entrees and each I was blown away by! Their steaks are top notch and literally MELT in your mouth. Their lobster was so fresh and yummy! and dont get me started on their mac and cheese. I died and went to heaven! Be careful though, it is VERY expensive. But it was sooo worth it!",

It was pretty busy in there too for a weekday.     We came here for a friend's bday that wanted to check this place out.  The bread, was pretty darn delicious.  It came as pull apart bread, with melted blue cheese atop and you dip it in the olive oil/chives (I think) sauce.  It was so good we had 2 servings.    Entree: I'm at a steak house so I ordered myself a bone in rib eye steak topped with foie gras butter at medium rare.  It was 20oz, and it was good.  It was priced at $56.  Was it all worth me coming back, eeeehhh.  Las Vegas has a lot of options, but still yes it is worth a try to compare.  Our table ordered a whole bunch of sides and the favorite seemed to be the sweet corn pudding and the mushroom pie.  We also paired it with a bottle of red wine to share.  If you are looking to splurge, sure, why not.  Would I come back, omg, not after I saw the bill.",

    "text": "I have no idea what all the fuss is all about. I have been to many better steak places than this one. The one thing this place has going for itself (in my mind) is that it is young and hip. Great people watching, but that's about it.   We came on a Tuesday night, the place was quite crowded. We waited for about 45 min for a table. They seated us (8 people) on a round table that fits 4-5 comfortably. I thought this was unacceptable. When you are spending $200 a pop, you expect to be seated comfortably. It's very loud (music). Quite tough to have a conversation at the dinner table.  Food is very expensive. They charge for everything extra, e.g. a little sauce on the side. The side dishes are tiny and $12 each - very pricey. There are no fries, the asparagus and spinach were very bland, both were cold by the time they got to our table, the potatoes with cheese and truffles on the other hand were quite yummy. There are no fries. The cheapest wine is $85, the most expensive $13,000 (for a bottle that retails for $200)  However, what is really the worst: the steak isn't that great. I had the sirloin medium rare. It was served on a cold plate and by the time I got my steak it was cold. It's sad to get a cold steak when you pay $200 a pop for a meal. The cut wasn't that great - quite stringy. Did I say already that the steak was disappointing??? One of the people in our group had the tuna. His verdict was \"not edible\" apparently strange texture and weird sauce. He is the least picky person I know, so it must have been quite unpleasant. But I guess you don't go to a steak house to eat tuna...  Service was mediocre. We constantly had to ask for water refills. There was no salt / pepper on the table and it took a long time to get some when our steak was there. While less trendy, the food at the Capital Grille is much better in my opinion.",

Check check! The music here is loud, so get ready to stay in the party atmosphere!  We started off with the shellfish platter which included oysters, pickled shrimp, alaskan king crab, and a huge lobster claw...all of which were very good. It also came with this green dipping sauce (lime?) that was out of this world.  I ordered the bone-in filet steak - medium rare - topped off with foie gras (VEGAS BABY) and asparagus on the side. It was delicious. She ordered the special sea bass not on the menu that came with these REALLY good mushrooms. I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and this was just fantastic - omg all day every day. Oh, and the fish was well done too haha  The bread crumb dessert combined with a lemondrop martini and smooth scotch on the side made this one heck of an evening to celebrate. The STK in LA is more well known, but I like this place just the way it is.",

There were not many people in the restaurant since it was early, so we had plenty of attention.  We started with a couple of their beautiful cocktails.  I don't remember the name of mine, but it had basil and jalapeno in a vodka martini styled drink....amazing.  Hubby had one that infused cucumber and mint in a vodka martini style....his was good too.  We started with salads - I had the burrata with tomatoes, and my husband got the wedge.  They were both very good, but I tried not to eat all mine so I would not fill up too fast.  We then each ordered filets - 6 oz. for me 10 oz. for him - and with a recommendation from our server, mine included blue butter and his included truffle butter.  Both were indulgent add ons, but boy were they good.  The steaks were so tender you could almost cut them with a fork, and they were prepared perfectly medium as requested.  We also had the jalapeno grits and grilled asparagus as sides.  Now, we are southerners, and I make a mean bowl of cheese grits, so maybe that's why we were so disappointed in the jalapeno grits....they just didn't have much taste.  I have to say though, it was the only thing we were disappointed in all night.  The grilled asparagus was perfect too.  When our server offered dessert, we were hesitant because we were pretty full.  But we had heard so much about their desserts - particularly the donuts - that we were not sure we could pass it up.  So, at the urging of the server, we ordered the donuts and a coffee for me and an aperitif for hubby.  O - M - G!!!!  Those donuts were like heaven on a plate.  Warm and light and flavorful....it was sinful!!  I think I dreamed about them later....haha!  Overall, our service was outstanding....maybe because there were not many people there when we arrived, but it was filling up fast.  The food could not be beat.  It was not inexpensive, but we felt like it was completely worth the splurge.  With so many restaurants in Vegas, it's hard to commit to going to the same place again, but you can bet we will visit STK again when we're in Vegas next time.",

It barely came with a side- I think there was like beans or something underneath.   My aunt and I ordered a side of mashed potatoes to share - big mistake. It was literally half a cup of mashed potatoes, if that.   We left still hungry and ended up getting pizza later that night.

Practically had to scream to talk. As I'm reading other yelp reviews looks like STK DOES NOT HONOR RESERVATIONS, like they didn't honor mine.  Food:  5/5 Skirt Steak 7oz.- Surprisingly my girls think I'm weird because I actually really skirt steak, if its cut right. Medium rare with a nice sear. Super juicy and flavorful. Yummy 1/5 Bone in Rib Steak 20oz.- I didn't really care for this, It was delicious but a little tough. A lot tougher than the skirt steak which is surprising.   Sides: 1/5 Asparagus- not sure if this was cooked properly but It tasted a little cold.  2/5 Parmesan Truffle Fries- Very Fluffy and yummy but it had a strong over powering taste of garlic powder. Totally ruined it.   Service: HORRIBLE!!! 0/5 We had reservations at 11pm, I understand they close at 12am so you would think they would want to seat us right away and take our order, NO. The hostess kept us waiting telling us our table wasn't ready. Finally seated at 11:30pm, I wasn't going to rush for them but wow no server no introductions, no water or drinks offered. We had to ask our busser who our waiter was. I've never been so ignored.",

It arrived medium well plus. Because we had somewhere to be to meet some friends I didn't send it back. I hate being that guy at the table.  The fries were meh....  I will not be back.",

I had the filet, asparagus and some kind of potato. Although I cannot say this is the best Filet I have had it was better than most. The 4 stars is because we got right in and my wife loves this place. .. ..  As it got later the interestingness (made up word) of the people got better. Cougars, pimps, college kids, transients, sugar daddies. they were all here fraternizing in a friendly fashion.",

I don't think this place was as good as, say Mastros... But it was good. A bit overpriced, nice atmosphere. Kinda loud, but the music was fun. The sweet potato donuts were good as well!",

    "text": "I've been to this STK at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  Compared to the one in Los Angeles, the Vegas STK seems to win in every category.  For starters, the decor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  We started at the bar and ordered a cocktail before getting seated.  There were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  Shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  As usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  We ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  This is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however I wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  It's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10K in bottle service over the last couple days.  Anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and I must say it's probably the best out there.  That is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in LA and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  But seriously this is beyond delicious!   The tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  It wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of a candied wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  The mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  Also, by adding the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  Next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  Although everything was amazingly delicious, I did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  Since we were on our way to another club I didn't want to over stuff myself so I ordered the petite filet; a couple of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  We ordered them medium rare but I noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  The lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so the center can stay cooler while charring the outside.  Anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  A few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  For sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spinach and some garlic potato wedges.  For me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  Crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  The spinach and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but I think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  To finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and a couple chocolate peanut butter bars.    The whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why I go to STK every time I'm in Vegas.",

I was more than a little concerned this trip. The food was very good but I ordered my steak peppercorn crusted and after a couple of bites realized it wasn't. The waiter asked what I wanted to do about it. He said he could put it back on the broiler.  After I had eaten on it?  Lo and behold that is exactly what happened. The same steak came back with a mild apology.  At the end of the meal, I was surprised to not have the bill adjusted in any way or to even be offered a comp of dessert. Not sure I will return when I return next month to Vegas.  Lots of coetition in this field in Vegas makes it unlikely.",

We had reservations for 7:45 for 3 people which we arrived promptly for only to be informed they had us down for 7:30 and that they were running at least  1/2 hour behind.  When you have tickets to a show in Vegas, having your restaurant running 1/2 behind is no bueno.  Little could be done, you can't just walk into another restaurant and be seating so we waited. They had no empathy and frankly had an uppity attitude about the whole thing.   I decided to get a glass of wine while we waited.  The girls behind the bar completely ignore female patrons.  I actually had to get the wine list from the gentlemen beside me.  Finally, a male bartender surfaced and I got my glass of wine.   Once seated, the entire experience changed and turned into what we were expecting.  Great vibe, great food, great wait staff, ready with info about Gluten free options.  Now if they could just get the front of their house and the bar in order, they'd be a premier restaurant in Vegas.",

Way over staffed...which I'm sure had everything to do with the holiday and opening week...but they were just standing around like flies and chatting away...including management.  Didn't look professional and felt crowded. There were only two restrooms that were unisex.  The attendant was not tending to them adequately.   The seats were wet and toilets weren't flushed.  Some interesting food items on the menu but only a couple lived up to their hype.  Sauces were disappointing in comparison to their house sauce and some proportions were off for the elaborate or eccentric culinary menu items they were trying to accomplish.  The steaks were cooked to True temp and very good quality and the blue cheese dressing was gourmet.  I didn't have a chance to look at the wines and the desert menu was minimal and not very creative.  Overall. Think they need time to grow but then again...its Vegas and I hear that it is a fun late night place...but anywhere with cheap cocktail waitress dresses usually is.  I may try it again....but mainly because it is at my new favorite hotel!",

We went for a friend's 30th birthday, and they were able to accommodate 9 of us in a booth at an oval table, which was great because we could all converse fairly well, until the club music was turned up around eight.  Everyone already had drinks so we dove straight into the appetizers, we had the tuna tar tare (decent, had better in Dallas) and the hamachi (very fresh). For dinner I had the small skirt steak with the jalapeno onions on top, it was a little over seasoned especially considering I ordered a topper. Perfectly cooked though and was more than I could eat. My S.O. had the seared big eye tuna, which he thought would be a tuna steak, he was seriously disappointed with the eight small pieces of tuna that had half a cup of sauce on top. Not worth the price. Dessert was so so, but their cappuccino is amazing! Skip the desserts and have one of those instead! Our server seemed very knowledgeable and was on top of everything all evening, and we were there 2.5 hours. The music got a little too loud for my taste, but all in all a good time.  I wouldn't return, just because there are always up and coming places to go, but it's a great place for a birthday dinner.",

I ordered the shrimp rice crispies (yum!), strip streak and topped off dinner with the cheesecake lollipops (sigh, so good!). Our server, Amy, was extremely knowledgable about the menu items. The environment is loud with a dj spinning a pretty good mix of hip hop/top 40. Its not for the faint of ears. Then again, I arrived at 10PM when the music was at its loudest, it could burst both eardums. But if you're aware of the loud music, then don't act surprised when you can't carry on a meaningful conversation with your dinnermate(s). Its just not the time and place for that. Its a party crowd, with really friendly/upbeat staff who even sit with you at your table. I love it! There's a lounge with dance floor in front of the dining area and a full bar where you can order from the full menu. Great food, fine dining prices, high-energy atmosphere.... I'm going back in a couple weeks for a friend's birthday party. You will leave there with quite unique memories.",

They have a DJ playing so you're sure to enjoy this place even more. I ordered the 6oz filet medallion. This may have been the best steak I have ever eaten. It was mouth watering. We ordered the mac and cheese, truffle fries, asparagus, broccollini, and creamed corn for the table. That was enough to feed 8 people.     The only complaint I had was the long wait for the restroom that is a single. I know this is random but that was the only thing I disliked about STK.",

    "text": "Came here Saturday night before the start of the Lenny Kravitz concert. The vibe of this restaurant is disco style nightclub/lounge with loud music. The staff were nice, but some make you feel like they are more important than you the guest. This is an attitude you usually see in Vegas nightclubs, not something you see in top restaurants where the guest is the most important thing.  The cocktail I had with grey goose and jalapeno was really good as was the wine.  The chopped salad and beet salad were both really good. For a steak house, I thought our server Jack would focus more on talking up the steaks and know much more about them. I asked which ones were grass fed and he gave me a confused stare.  I went with the Wagyu with Jalapeno onions and my wife got the Dover Sole. The Wagyu was as good as you would expect from any steakhouse. Nothing special, and the jalapeno onions provided a kick, maybe a little too much. The Mac and cheese and spinach sides were also good.  The $58 Dover sole wasn't impressive at all. We were expecting it to be flakey, but it had a rubbery texture and the presentation had it drowning in some sauce. I would recommend the Dover sole at Bellagio's Michael Mina. It blows this one way out of the park.  The sweet potato doughnuts were fantastic and were enjoyed immensely.  While our server Jack did a good job, my only complaint which put a damper on our evening was the aggressive busser. I understand the importance of turning over tables, but this guy made our dinner feel rushed. He kept trying to clear out table while we were still eating. He then offered us a box, after we said we were still eating.  At the end of our meal, we asked for a glass of water, while my wife finished her wine. He didn't even respond and got an attitude. Even though we had spent over $400 on our meal, this guy made us feel like we needed to leave now, so he could clear the table.  Unfortunately, after this. I don't think we will come back.  Other than the doughnuts, the food is standard, not stand out. The location is good if you are going to a concert, but this is not a place I would go out of my way to eat at. For a stand out steak dinner, I would go to Bavettes at Park MGM.  If we go to the Chelsea again, we will look at some of the other restaurants nearby.",

After I received a phone call confirming our reservation I told her we are attending the vegas hockey game and we will have jerseys on is this ok? She said absolutely no problem come in in and enjoy a great meal before you go.  So we get there and the hostess asks us to remove our jerseys. I then tell her I specifically asked the lady who called to confirm reservations if we could wear our jerseys into restaurant and she said yes. The hostess then said \" your not wearing a Vegas jersey so you have to remove it\". Well we are not vegas fans even tho we live here. We were fans of the opposing team and cancelled our reservation and turned us away at the door. Very disrespectful and disappointing and I will share this with everyone I know.",

When we arrived we were seated in the front, crammed into a small table - I was very unhappy, but hubby talked me down so we could enjoy our meal, which was excellent as usual. Our server Paul was just great, attentive but didn't feel rushed for a Saturday night.  Hubby started with a Gimlet and I had a G&T. For appetizer we had the shrimp cocktail, which was very good, and they served 6 shrimp which was unusual.  For dinner, I had the 6 oz filet, cooked a perfect medium rare, and Hubby had the larger filet, also cooked perfect medium rare plus. Sides were truffle fries (YUM, YUM, YUM!!) and asparagus.  The night would have been perfect if we had the table I requested - in hindsight I wish I had said something, we had been as the Cosmo for 7 nights, so dropped some coin at the hotel.  That said we would go back to STK - a hip vibe, but be prepared to open up your wallet - in our opinion, worth every penny.",

The environment is one of my favorite things about this restaurant!  In Vegas a good steak is pretty easy to obtain, so although STK has great food I was looking for something more.  They always deliver on environment.  I love that they have loud music played by a DJ.  If you are looking for a fun restaurant for a group party I would highly recommend!  The service is always good as well.  I actually thought the food was not as good as some of the other locations, but this could have just been an off night.  The experience is still such a great one and I would highly recommend for birthday parties, bachelorette parties or girl's trips!",

My steak was good, cooked the way I requested, but my husband's was a little more done than he wanted.  The Parmesan Truffle fries could have had a little more Truffle...it was more of an essence of truffle.  The Iceberg Wedge salad was delicious though.  The restaurant is loud...loud music and loud conversations.  Not the type of ideal atmosphere if you are looking for romantic, but there was good energy! Service was good, our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive.  Overall, a nice meal, but I was hoping for a little more for the price tag.",

Not even close I am so thankful I made reservations which where at 7:45 we arrive right on time and and it was booming in there, great loud music club style they have a DJ and the staff is constantly going but are also very nice and friendly.    After about ten minutes we were seated, and then shortly greeted by our waiter who was awesome. We were brought fresh baked bread with chive oil which was amazing could of had so many. more of those, then we started off with Beef Tartare - Italian capers - whole grain dijon, poached quail egg, truffled croutons, it was so flavorful and perfect amount of each flavor spread out on toast. The other starter we had was Lil' BRGS - waygu beef, special sauce, sesame seed bun. Everything we we have had is excellent and so perfectly crafted.   Then as the main meal the boyfriend had 6 oz A5 Kobe New York and a side of Mac and cheese, the beef was so light and flavorful some of the best I have tried.   Then I had the Colorado lamb chops - carrot glaze, mint lava bean ragout, pomegranate vinaigrette, I would have to say it was some of the best lamb chops I have ever tried and I have had a few. It was so tender and light the flavor was perfectly even and so juicy every bite was amazing and melted in your mouth.   We will definitely be coming back here I do recommend making a reservation first, you will not be disappointed.",

We started with a seafood tower which we added more shrimp and ump crab to it.   The lump crab was more like a crab salad with more filler than crab and it was a letdown.  The crab in the crab legs was too soft and lacked flavor.    Three of us ordered the bone in strip and one ordered the filet.  All four of us found out steaks to be under seasoned which detracted from the steak considerably.     We ordered a slew of sides.  The mashed potatoes were awesome.  The truffle fries were delicious.   The mushrooms were perfect.  The asparagus was uninteresting. The creamed spinach was soupy and awful.     Our server was great and we enjoyed his humor.  He was the bright spot of the evening at STK.  I doubt I will go back due to the steak being boring and lacking proper preparation.",

The bread was a definite slam dunk.   My steak was just eh. Not seasoned too well.  If I'm being honest,  the dessert is what made me give 3 stars, because I was going to give it 2.

However I just don't understand why the management feels the need to have extremely loud music playing and that is why my rating is so low. Our group of 4 was there from 5:15 to 6:30. I love a good dj and loud music but not when I'm eating a meal at $150 per person. It just came off as if the restaurant was trying too hard to be the 'trendy dance club/restaurant' because it's Vegas.  I know it's been proven that customers order more alcohol when a restaurant is loud but this was ridiculous! Honestly I liked all the songs being played and if they had even turned it down a little I would have enjoyed my meal and the music.",

Of course I had to continue my love affair with a sidecar cocktail ( ok I had 3).   My other half always orders dessert first!

    "text": "Fine dining prices means a fine dining experience!  I did not get that experience at this restaurant.  My experience went as follows: To start, there are 4 hostesses at the front that do not give their attention quickly. They finish their side conversations before acknowledging you.  I check in for my reservation 45 minutes early, so I know I'm going to sit at the bar. But before I can mention that to the hostess, she quickly interrupts me to inform me \"they won't be able to seat me until closer to my reservation time.\"  So, we are at the bar, and our bartender Sara was AMAZING. As she starts our drinks, the hostess shows up to seat us. This is way earlier than I thought they'd be able to, so I ask if I can get our drinks first and she says \"ok, just come find me when you're ready to be seated.\"  I did just that and had to wait an additional 5 minutes at the front waiting on her. Then, after taking us to our table, makes us wait as we arrive for her to find another chair for the table.  Once finally sat, we order appetizers. They arrive, and we don't see our server again until the appetizers are complete.  We finish our meals and enjoyed every single bite of it!!  As we leave, I look at these same 4 hostesses for a farewell, but do not receive one.   Now, on a more overall note, the music (done by an in house DJ) is VERY loud. We had to basically yell to speak to each other.  The place is very small, so it felt very cramped.  The food was absolutely, hands down, AMAZING!! That food is the sole reason I'm not giving 1 Star. It was to die for.  This entire experience felt more like a good meal in a club setting. The prices are extremely high, and I was okay with paying that if the experience would have matched the price.  I doubt I'll return.",

The food was carefully prepared and very delicious. We had a fairly large group, so tried a bunch of side dishes.  Lobster Mac and cheese, mushroom pot pie, summer chopped salad, Parmesan Truffke fries and creamed corn. Wow toall. I had the Colorado Lamb Chops.  Two chops with a braised lamb crepe.  An amazing  that reached for the sky and hit on all notes. Service was super and very attentive to all requests.",

We didn't really care for the green dipping sauce which had very little taste but the bread was outstanding. The shrimp cocktail was fresh and it came with a very delicious spicy cocktail sauce but not too spicy. We then got some scallops which were perfectly cooked. We had the salmon and steak. I chose the cowboy steak which I took to go and it lasted me 3 days. The mac & cheese was amazing! We especially loved the crispy topping! But, the creamed spinach wasn't that creamy. Overall, it was a great evening!",

If the bar up front is too busy remember there's a smaller bar towards the back left.  Overall, be ready for a over-the-top night when the DJ is on point at this type of Vegas hotspot.",

Our friends were coming to visit, so we kept our reservation for 9pm at STK and they joined us there for two apps and drinks. At first our server was friendly and accommodating to my food allergies which I sincerely appreciated. However when he realized we were celebrating a birthday but just getting apps and drinks and no entrees his entire demeanor did a 180. Opportunity area for this location would be to train your employees on facial expressions and emotional intelligence.",

I was told the wait would be up to 15 minutes, but by the time I got to the bar and ordered a drink they were ready to take us to our table.   During my short bar visit I ordered a Paloma, which was one of the most refreshing drinks I've ever had. A quarter of a fresh grapefruit was muddled into tequila, mixed with light carbonation - perfection.  They brought over a break-a-part bread that was covered in a blue cheese butter that tasted heavenly.   We got a couple appetizers to kick things off - the tuna tartare & the pork belly. My favorite was the pork belly, which was thick, crispy, and juicy.   I ordered a rare 8oz Filet, which was also perfection with added peppercorn. We got a variety of sides, which included the lobster mac and cheese, creamed corn (tad too sweet for me), and broccolini. Side note - I also consumed 3 other Paloma's during this feast.  We ended up ordering the warm chocolate chip cookie for dessert which was a la mode. Came out in a mini cast iron skillet and was cooked to gooey greatness.   Overall, highly recommend this place. Wonderful atmosphere with great food.",

It was slightly difficult to get a reservation due to their hours of operation and for some reason online reservation system wouldn't accept us. We were able to get in at a desirable time.....5:00. Upon arrival we were greeted by hostess and seated. The ambiance was nice. Chic decor... no complaints. We looked over the menu and wine list. Decent selection on both. The waitresses lacked the welcoming spirit that I'm used to at a semi high end restaurant. The staff moral over all was a bit low . Our server  was not bubbly, enthusiastic and treated us as if we were an inconvenience.  Within 30 minutes the place was packed and got very loud. They play really upbeat music that keeps you singing and wanting to get up and dance while dining. Although it was a nice choice of music I'm not sure how I feel about the noise level while dining. Not conducive for conversation.  The food arrived and was ok. Brussels sprouts were almost burned , my salmon was just ok. My friends felt the same way about their meals. Just ehhhh.  Will try other restaurant next time.",

This place made it to my list of places to try because there was a picture of Kobe Bryant eating here and holding a diamond encrusted pink sapphire steak knife. (You can thank him for the referral) STK lived up to all the expectations that I have of any steak house on the strip in Vegas. My girlfriend and I had salad, steaks, and mashed potatoes. Every bite of my steak was perfect.   The atmosphere of this place felt like a club/lounge. I wouldn't expect to stay long after you're done eating. Usually during prime hours you can tell they're trying to get you in and out of the place by the vibe of the atmosphere. The pricing is just like every other steak house on the Vegas strip.  I would definitely recommend to try this place to any of my friends making a trip to Vegas!",

Anyways, let's go over the positives. The service is good, friendly waiter with strong knowledge of the menu. Not pushy, and gives you time and space. Other goods were the bread, the corn, and the dessert. The steak for some were better than others, mine was slightly charged (the cowboy steak). My favorite part of the meal was probably the dessert: we got the donuts and the cheese cake, both really good. Oh yeah the truffle fries were pretty good.  The negatives: portion size of the sides for $13 - two people won't be full on one. Also, pricing for drinks (might have been $13-15 per well drink?), maybe a little bitter about the alcohol portion of the tab since I was in a casino and can get drinks for free (or while losing hundreds)! Lol. Another negative as stated above, the partially charred steak, my friends said theirs were really charred. The Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes were meh! Guess overall slightly disappointed for a $750 meal for the 7 of us.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to a STK restaurant for quite a while and finally had the chance.  This restaurant blends the nightclub atmosphere with a fancy steakhouse and does it well.  It is not very large, so if coming on a weekend, you need a reservation but if you happen to be in town during the week you shouldn't have an issue finding a table.  The prices here are what you'd expect at a fancy steakhouse and will run you about $100 a person on the average.  I had the bone-in rib eye and it was cooked a perfect medium and melted in your mouth.  It was one of the better cooked steaks I've had in a long time and tasted delicious.  I chose the Cauliflower Gratin which was just OK.  It just didn't have much flavor.  I feel maybe some salt would have helped, or perhaps using salted butter instead would have given it enough of an oomph it so desperately needed. We also had the Mac & Cheese at the table as a recommendation by the server and while it was creamy (I always like my mac creamy), it still didn't wow anyone.  Both our sides fell flat on all 3 of us at the table and we agreed we should have either had no sides or picked others.  We didn't even bother boxing the left overs to go.  This is where this place loses a star for me.  Service was great!  Everyone was on their toes refilling waters and delivering food on time and in order.  Would I come back here?  Not sure.  With the amount of amazing steakhouses in Las Vegas, it is a very tough decision on where to go each visit.  If I stayed at Cosmo again, I'd definitely consider it.",

It was well seasoned and had a beautiful crispy sear outside of the steak with a prefect medium rare meat inside. I also ordered a corn pudding on the side, which was good but it was nothing special compared to the steak I had. Prices are reasonably for the quality of food you are recieving and the staff were professional and attends to your every need.",

Came for a friends birthday with a party of....hmmm, maybe 25...and got the private room =) Which was really cool because we were told Oprah and JayZ ate in that room. Hip hop music was blasting; the walls were padded and sound proof; and there was a flat screen in there. Really interesting ambiance!  Anyways, our waiter was super funny and good-looking. (Wouldn't expect anything else from STK/Cosmo). Service was great because he was fun, informative, and even took a couple shots with us...of which he paid for! I'm not sure u can drink on the job nor why he paid for them but, we'll take it.  Their bread was delicious!!!!! The bread's dipping sauce was amazing...looked like pesto and olive oil... Their wine list was second to none. They had my favorite tequila! And their oysters were pretty fresh. I had lamb. DUH! And it was \"eh..\" I mean, maybe I should've had s-t-e-a-k at a steak house but, alas, I've had better. And ordered their \"famous\" mac and cheese as my side....and I was really disappointed =( It was salty. Sadly, I tried friends' mac and cheese and theirs were really good. I should've gotten the mushrooms.  Their birthday cake is...gourmet, of course! I think they order the cake from Cosmo's bakery.  All in all, I'm glad I ate there..just to say I've eaten there. But, it's not someplace I want to eat at any time soon.",

We had a 6:30pm reservation, so there was no music for the majority of our time eating. The music came on at the end of our meal and was a good playlist, but soon became loud and like a club. It became difficult to talk across the table and impossible to hear the waitress. We were seated in a booth that was so crammed in that we could hear the conversations of the nearby tables.   The food was very average. We ordered the scallops as an appetizer but found them very bland and chewy. We both ordered filets which were also bland and overcooked. For sides we tried the asparagus and potatoes. Our waitress brought over the wrong type of potatoes and we decided not to complain due to our frustration with the experience thus far. The asparagus was limp and had a tasteless, greasy brown sauce. The wine was great and the service was decent.   Overall, I was very unimpressed and wouldn't go back on my next trip to Vegas.",

Never saw a manager at any of the tables or I would have brought some of these items to attention.  This place is EXPENSIVE... But you're in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it's a great venue to eat.

We arrived 10 minutes before our scheduled reservation but there wasn't a problem we were about 18 people they seated us and very efficiently,the waitstaff was very accommodating and explained anything that we wanted to know about the menu, The Decour I would say is Modern The noise level wasn't bad at all it was easy to converse without screaming some of these restaurants in Vegas tend to be very loud but again that's Vegas! Now for our meal we started out with a cold fish platter consisting of oysters on the half shell shrimp ceviche alaskan King crab and clams on the half shell (little necks) The presentation was very nice the Alaskan King crab all cracked open for you,the drinks from the bar were very good and they served us within 15 minutes remember we were 18 people, Now to the main course I had a peppercorn crusted bone in ribeye 24 ounce I received my steak and it was prepared just the way I like my steak medium rare! My wife ordered Chilean sea bass which was excellent! The parmesan fries is a must-have!! Also the corn pudding if you don't have it you will definitely regret it!The prices are a little on the high side but that's what you expect in a good steakhouse and this is a good steakhouse!

We both ordered steaks, mine a 6 oz & his a 8 oz which the steaks alone costed $100 & then any side dishes you chose was additional $15 each which we ordered the Yukon potatoes which reminded me of potatoes out of a box & the asparagus we ordered had a horrible taste.  Then to top it off our side orders were given to the table next to us so we sat with only our steaks in front of us for approximately 5-10minutes.  After tasting them they should've just left it in the kitchen.  We thought the staff at the front desk acted like they were above the customers who pay their wages.  Our suggestion to anyone thinking about eating here is please rethink your choice.  It was my husbands birthday so we thought we'd have a nice dinner...it was anything but.",

Pros: If you instagram with #unmistkable you get a free glass of champy The bok choy is to die for  Cons: 5 of the 7 steaks that we ordered came out under or over done. 5! I expect this at Outback Steakhouse...not STK where I am paying $50 for a steak. Management was very quick to send them back to the kitchen, and while everyone was pleased with how theirs came back, mine was still overdone. I didn't want to hold up the group even longer (we were dining pre-concert) so I just ate it as-is.  That being said, management was very good about providing us with new sides (so they were warm when our new steaks came out), free dessert and a % off the bill. Much appreciated for sure. It was just a disappointment that we had to experience that in the first place, when we were out for a big night. I can understand MAYBE getting 1 out of the 7 messed up.......but 5? Really?",

The bread we got was so hard so I asked for another one. My waitress responded with that's because it's the end of the night and the kitchen is closing soon. Are you serious?1! It's Vegas! And so what we get bread that's been sitting around all night. So she brought out another one and said that this was THE very last bread of the night...and it was just as hard. I use to love that bread. Immediately were rushed to order drinks and food. My strip loin was perfection! But that was the only thing. The jalapeno grits had no flavor, but that's the first time I've ever had them. The mushroom pie thing was so disappointing. I swear they must have run out of mushrooms because once I cut into it the top deflated and the inside maybe had 4 mushrooms and 2 pearl onions. With the rush we didn't have time to order dessert. We spent a good amount on food and drinks and to not really be able to enjoy was a buzz kill. I doubt I'll come back to this location again. Sad.",

And the remaining 3 who did not get overcooked steak, had a great, great meal.  The appetizers and salads were nothing to write home about and I would honestly suggest skipping them. They fill you up, cost more than they should (seriously, it shouldn't cost $15+ to simply cut a head of lettuce in half, that's crazy).  I got the skirt steak which was fantastic. It was a LOT of steak, when it comes out and you see those two lengthy strips lying next to each other you think you'll never finish that much steak. But, I have to say, mine was just soooo damn good. Full of flavor, cooked well and after each bite I found myself savoring for the next one. I would definitely go back just for the skirt steak.  The sides we got were fine, mac and cheese probably the best of them, but simply what you'd expect.  We didn't get dessert, opting for some shots instead. The shots were watered down which was honestly totally unnecessary and disappointing.  I rarely do this, but I have to say, the atmosphere at STK is simply incredible. Really sets the mood for the rest of the night. It's on the darker side, not high ceiling, interesting wall/table/seat designs. I'd say it has the best atmosphere of the Vegas steakhouses.",

    "text": "I realize that STK is some hyper-cool, vowel-free play on the word \"steak\", but I also hoped that it might also be an acronym for something.  Perhaps \"Sexy Trendy K____\", but I couldn't think of an appropriate K-word.  Oh well.  Linguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.  I had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)  I ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:  ** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.  ** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.  ** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)    ** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.  ** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!  Service was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect \"Vanderpump Rules\"-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.  I was definitely impressed by STK.  The whole experience was PRFCT.",

The inside was the perfect redness but once you get in there, the steak is DRY. We got one side - the creamed spinach... and it literally just tasted like spinach with cream on top of it. Go to any other steakhouse - Gordon Ramsay Steak, Mastros, Cut, and they will show you what real good creamed spinach tastes like. Definitely will not be returning and I will be telling my friends not to go too.",

I'll give you the goods first: it's in the Cosmo, they had good drinks/wine, the atmosphere is fun, the music they played was awesome. The bad: the food was just ehh, nothing special at all, and all of my food seemed to be overcooked. The service was pretty bad, and it was so extremely overpriced it was almost comical. Overall the food is not worth coming here for. If you are just looking for a fun night and club type restaurant, this is it-just don't expect the food to wow you.",

Obviously Cosmo is a hot hotel making this spot better. I'll be back im sure but will try others first.",

Sauteed spinach cake in a beautiful Staub cast iron, but was completely cold. Complete and utter disappointment. Wish I woulda skipped this meal....and the bathrooms are gross.

The mushroom pot pie, which had rave reviews, was too rich and not enough pie. Mashed potatoes were gross. My client had a $20 martini that was served with a bitchy attitude by a bartender with fake tits.  Typical of Vegas smoke and mirrors bullshit.

Only thing that sucks is parking. As most of us locals know, getting in/out of the Cosmo is a pain in the rear. Other than that, place rocks.  P.S. Not kid friendly, in my opinion.

I ordered the Romaine Salad and a Braised Short Rib.  Well, they brought out the wrong salad.  Instead, I had a cottage cheese type of salad.  However, I have to say that the Braised Short Rib was EXCELLENT.  Let me say that again, the RIBS were EXCELLENT.  Just of note, Salad was $12, Ribs was $39 bucks, $10 for asparagas (?!!), and wine was another thing!  Ouch.  Now, why I gave it a 2 stars.  For a fine dining restaurant, it was not an intimate nor refine setting.  Rather, it felt like a rock concert where the guests are SQUEEZED into as many tables as possible.  The seats were soo uncomfortable.  Shoot... we felt like sardines crunched into our dining seat.  To put this into perspective, imagine the table next to you, you would be literally be 2-3 inches away from their elbow.    Forget holding a conversation.  Many times, I just ended up yelling and screaming to try to communicate.  No wonder my waiter got my order wrong.  He could not hear me.     Overall, it was a bad experience.  Food was good, service was average, environment was the pits.  For a fine dining experience where it is over $100 a person to dine (meal and wine), nah, I look for something better.    Pass....",

Other reviews claim the music is extremely loud, but we did not experience that. The DJ was awesome! 80's & 90's hits had people get up and dance next to their tables. We were seated close to the DJ and held a conversation with ease. Our group ranged in age from 30-42, and all of us agreed the music definitely added to the experience.   Waiter was great, didn't rush us even when the place started getting slammed. You MUST have reservations. Not cheap though. Four of us, appetizers, cocktails + dinner- $500. We go to Vegas twice a year for 15 years- this was our favorite restaurant experience so far.  We sat across from Dave Chappelle, who even came over and spoke with us for a bit.

It's the typical side by side seating in the lower dining area. It's obnoxious trying to have a conversation during a special dinner when you're listening to the people next to you. The music is loud. Again, for the price, more intimate seating should be available. Our server didn't go over any of the specials, we listened to the server at the table to our right, he messed up the entree, and we were checked on once. The busser took our bread without asking if we were finished. Portions are small so the bread would've been nice to fill us a little more. Typical steakhouses give you decent portioned sides, this one does not. Side portions are individual servings. We didn't even know the servers name. There was gum stuck under our table. Who does that....Our total bill was 189 and change. For that price, I expect better service and a decent portion. We left still hungry.",

They might have only put tiny tiny tiny bit of truffle, can't even smell it.. :P  The desert was super sweet, proabably more for kids than adults.    I guess I gave it 4 stars because it was such a fun experience for us thanks to our waiter.  There are simply too many steak houses in Vegas that rocks.  Btw, this is my 2nd try on STK.

    "text": "I've only eaten here once and I have to say it is just a tad-bit overrated.  I don't think the food is their specialty and the ambiance of the restaurant is definitely not for everyone.  It is super \"trendy\" and \"clubby\", which is weird for a steakhouse, but can also be a really fun pre-party place.  Pre-party as in, pre-Marquee..however, who wants to go clubbing on a full stomach?   Anyway, the restaurant is really dark and they have BLARING house music on so that you canNOT hear anyone who isn't directly in a position where you can shout into their ear during conversation.  The table we were sat at is one of those U-shaped booths, so that your entire party is facing into the restaurant, not each other.  I hate those booths!  So with the seating arrangement and the loud music, I ended up only talking to 2 of the girls I was with in our party of 8.  Lame.  The food was really just okay.  Midway through dinner the girls at a table near us started dancing on their table and the counter behind their booth and swigging champagne out of the bottle.  Classy.  I would say that if you're part of a younger crowd just looking for a fun pre-party dinner, this is a good spot.  But if you're looking for a real nice steakhouse and meal, try somewhere less clubby.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here without a reservation on a Monday evening and were seated right away...  We were greeted right away by our server, but I felt rushed when she asked for our drink orders. I hadn't even had the chance to touch the menu to open and browse it. She comes back and takes our drink order and asked if we're ready to order. Come on!! I've only been here 5 minutes! Just let me look at the menu for a little bit... If I wanted fast food, I would've gotten fast food.  She returns with our cocktails, my husband orders an Old Fashioned and I get the Black Rye Affair (both really good and strong) and asks if we would like a bottle of wine. I'm like WTF at this moment, but I stay calm and collected. I answer, No thank you. While she is still at the table, I asked her how the Foie Gras was here at STK. She asks if I've ever had Foie... Well, Hun, I asked how it was here at this restaurant, NOT what foie was or was like.   We order...   We started with a salad \"Romaine\", I think it's their version of a Caesar. It was pretty good. I liked the Parmesan lemon dressing.  Shared the Bone-in Ribeye (med rare), Parmesan Truffle Fries, Asparagus, Cauliflower Gratin. We order the Foie Gras to be topped on the steak, but it did not come out with it. I had to ask the food runner for it. He apologized and said it wasn't on the ticker but will have it right out. She forgot to put it in.. :-/  The ribeye was grilled perfectly to temp, the Foie Gras was a little \"veiny\" I could not cut/break apart. Everything lacked seasoning.. I was disappointed! We didn't not finish anything, but our salad and drinks.  The gentleman cleared off our table and looked at me kind of weird.. Probably because of all of the food that was still left. There was no salt or pepper at the table for me to season my food. So, I just didn't want anymore. I don't care how much it costs, if I am not enjoying it, I'm not going to finish it.   15 minutes passes after getting our table cleared, we are still waiting on our server. We were ready for the check and she has not come by. My husband had to stop another server to go find ours. She comes by about 10 minutes after asking the other lady to find her for us. We ask her for the check right away when she gets back to us. She offers dessert and coffee to us right after us asking for the bill... We  were mentally out of this restaurant 30 minutes ago! No thank you on dessert and coffee!   We were excited about trying STK based on the reviews, but instead ended up feeling this place was entirely over rated. At least the food and service was.  I would come here for the atmosphere and drinks at the bar only. Not what I expected for $200 and \"nicer\" restaurant,",

    "text": "Overall good experience at STK Las Vegas. 5 star food without a doubt. The blue cheese butter bread was amazing, and the best filet mignon I've had - cooked to perfection. Variety of sides that did justice too, highly recommend the parmesan truffle fries and mac&cheese.   Have to deduct 1 star for the service. Hostess was vert friendly but the waiter not so much. Our reservation was quite early and the restaurant was fairly empty yet the waiter struggled to put on a smile and with every question/recommendation we asked, it seemed like we were an annoyance. Regardless, the most disappointing part was that I booked this reservation way in advance informing the restaurant that I was celebrating an anniversary. I was expecting some sort of acknowledgement in the form of a dessert (like pictures in other reviews for birthdays, etc.), but nothing! It was evident that the restaurant was not going to do anything and I knew this was the case when we were asked if we had room for dessert.  Overall, I'd come back to STK again, however would be interested in trying other steakhouses and restaurants on the strip. Great food and menu, but service sub par.",

    "text": "STK is on par with everything the Cosmo does - trendy and over-the-top, prices included.    We arrived as a group of 8 for business on a Wed night, at one of the earlier seatings.   Restaurant was pretty empty, but we had to wait at the bar for the full group to arrive before they'd seat us.  If the rating was based on the hotness of the hostess, this place would be a 5 and then some; alas, it's for food and service.  We were promptly seating by our svelte and sauntering hostess in one of the back booths, loud 90s dance music blaring in the background.  Our server was nice enough, helping with the menu where it was needed.  She offered us the daily specials, which I couldn't remember any of.  Put our orders in and brought out the wine, as well as the bread.  Didn't recall the name or type but the buttery goodness I do remember distinctly.  Very yummy.    My peppercorn encrusted filet medallion, medium rare, came out perfectly seared with the right amount of pink hues.  Very tender and flavorful.  We got sides to share - creamed sweet corn, potatoes puree, asparagus, spinach, and potato al gratin.  Nothing really stood out as unique or overly amazing, but there was good flavors throughout the meal.    I didn't get a look at the final bill, but I assume it was easily 150 a person, which put it around 1200 or so; kind of outrageous considering the food was average.  Not sure I'd revisit with all of the other great steak places in town.  1.5 for the awesome server and bus service, and .5 for the overpriced food, and 1 star for the hostess... :P",

The atmoshpere is fun if not a bit too loud on the music.  I'm not a big fan of yelling across the booth to speak with my friends.  The service is not bad but not good either.  It just sort of is.  They did mess up on our carpaccio.  We ordered 2 and they brought us only one.  Instead of bringing us another they took the one on our table back and brought out another which still is just one carpaccio.    If you like star gazing then this is the place for you.

    "text": "I must admit that at first we were a bit hesitant in giving this place a try. There haven't been too many reviews yet for this restaurant, which made us a little uneasy about choosing this place. All we knew is that we wanted to try a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and both the vibe & menu of STK got our attention.   We checked out the Chandelier Bar & managed to lose some money on the tables before heading over for our 8:00 reservation. My first impression of this place was that it was a bit smaller than I expected, and other reviewers are right in saying the music is bumping.   We sat at the bar for about 10 mins. before being seated. Although I would have rather sat back further in the actual dining area we were seated in another dining section right off the bar...I guess it made for some good people watching at the bar (like guys with lucky poker pants...see pics)! Also, I thought it might be a little hard at first to hold a conversation over the music but to my surprise it wasn't at all...but maybe that's because the more I drink the louder I naturally get, and so goes for my spouse and probably just about everyone else out there, haha ; )   The bread is amazing, so amazing I took one bite and just stopped so I wouldn't get full off of just bread.  For starters, we had their foie gras french toast and beef tartare. Both were exceptional....the foie gras french toast had a very interesting flavor while being sweet at the same time and the beef tartare was actually the best I have tasted. I have only ever tried like 3 in my life, but it just surprised me how fresh, light, and tasty this one was!   I ordered a filet, which was a bit over cooked for medium but I didn't want to send it back and just enjoyed what I could of it. My husband's ribeye was cooked a perfect rare and he just about ate the whole thing! On the side, we enjoyed maple glazed carrots and sweet corn pudding. The sweet corn pudding tasted like a dessert to me, almost not like a side at all. We passed on actual dessert and just enjoyed our wine.   Our server was great! Usually, when we go to restaurants we are often attended to by a team of servers. And, sometimes it's even hard to figure out who the head-server is, but at STK our server stayed with us the whole time, which we enjoyed.   One thing I wanted to note was that the music was definitely bumping and other reviewers are correct in saying if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner for two...this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for an upbeat space with some great service & food then you STK might be just what you are looking for.",

The crust was thin and salty and the mushrooms were sliced thin in a thick cream sort of more like a cream soup than a traditionally thick pot pie. The brussel sprouts w/bacon was a bit hard but had flavor. The haricot vert was really tasty. Hard to make green beans that special but I really liked them alot.",

The drinks are good, but if you go here, know that you are eating gourmet steaks in a bar like atmosphere.  Very noisy, not intimate at all, and that's okay if that's what you want.

    "text": "It's an upscale steakhouse that conveniently located in the heart of things - so you can grab you dinner here and be close to all the nightlife events right after.  You pass the Cosmo's Chandalier Bar before you hit the entrance to STK so it sets up just the right mood.  The interior and atmophere is what I expect from an upscale Vegas restaurant.  It has unique decor, feels open, and has a clubby vibe to it.    We got seated to our table as soon as we got there for our reservation (which doesn't always happen).  The waiter was also very patient and helpful in getting our drink order - not the easier task when a group of 8 girls is trying to decide which fruity drink to get. Haha.  The drinks were all fantastic, but I've never really had any complaints about drinks that I've gotten from Vegas.  The food, on the other hand, was a hit or miss.  Here's what we got:   BREAD FOR THE TABLE:  O.M.G!  I'm sure all the other yelpers have commented on how amazing this bread is.  It even looks amazing - coming out in the shape of a muffin glazed with deliciousness with a green side dipping sauce that takes you back for a moment because it's green.  When you get over the awe and actually dig in to eat it, it just melts in your mouth - one of those crispy and buttery on the outside, and soft on the inside.  And that dipping sauce!!!    FOIE GRAS Appetizer: I indulged with Foie Gras ever since California banned it (not necessarily banned it completely, but it might as well have been with the restrictions).  I ordered both the appetizer and the side to go on top of my steak.  The foie gras was excellent - cooked perfectly - tender - juicy - fatty!  Unfortunately it was paired with a sweet element - I can't even remember what it was (applesauce, berries? no clue) - all I remember was that it DID NOT compliment well.  I separated the two and only focused on the foie gras.    FILET MIGNON with FOIE GRAS: Have already commented on the awesomeness of the foie gras and it didn't disappoint.  However, the piece that came with the entree was much smaller than the appetizer.  If I could go back, I'd order two appetizer ones, and save one to eat with the steak.  Unfortunately again, the filet mignon was overcooked and chewy.  Yes, you read right, CHEWY!  FILET MIGNON!  I was very disappointed.  STK is a STEAKhouse and their steak was actually the only thing I would not get again.  Maybe they were having an off night or an off-piece, but how do you mess up such a fine cut like filet!?!    MUSHROOM POT PIE:  This side dish was the highlight of our side dishes - a MUST GET!  It's a combination of probably 4-5 different mushroom type, baked under some dough to soak in all the delicious sauce.  It was one of those unique dishes that are not offered in many places, but tastes super awesome!    If you have a big group and are celebrating an event, this place is a good option.  Be prepared to pay some big bucks (but hey, you're in Vegas!).",

Our server was spot on. The food on the other hand was okay. One thing that really annoyed me that if you want your steak to taste super yummy, you can order an extra sauce to be cooked on it for $2 extra. I did not order the extra sauce since I figured this expensive steak must be amazing without extra sauce. The steak was actually just okay. I would compare it to a steak that you would find at a diner. Also, it annoys the crap out of me when I feel I am being nickeled and dimed. $2 for a steak sauce??? Just add $2 to the price of each steak and call it a complimentary sauce. I so wanted a special dinner for my birthday but it didn't happen. At least the company I was with made up for it. Would not recommend this place.",

We asked for the sliders well done they came out almost raw. One of the food runners was a little testy with us. The sides are ridiculously small even compared to other high-end restaurants like Mastro's.   The one thing that makes STK stand apart is the DJ. Its. super entertaining....makes for an awesome atmosphere ,would probably go back for drinks just for that.   I really like the manager Clayton of the Las Vegas location super cool guy came over to the table to make sure everything was great.",

The mood of the restaurant is romantic, sophisticated, and hip. Yes, the music is a tad louder than normal but it just adds to the playful atmosphere, and hey I like a little extra stimulation in Vegas. We ordered a couple appetizers, the beef carpaccio and fois gras waffles. the Fois gras waffles were absolutely spectacular. The creamy fois gras melted tenderly with  You must order this. The beef carpaccio was great as well, it was served with a bit of pesto angel hair pasta. Very fresh tasting compared to the savory fois gras waffles, so it was a good balance.  For main course, there was a Thanksgiving Prix Fixe menu available, but really I came for the steak, so of course I ordered the bone-in ribeye with truffle butter on top. It was the tastiest steak I've had in Vegas so far. The meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasonings. You don't actually need the extra toppings. My friend who did order the Thanksgiving prix fixe dinner enjoyed it just as much. It came with a main dish of turkey served two ways; traditional turkey breast and delicious breaded dark meat. It came with generous servings of all your favorite sides.   Please do not skip dessert. You must order the sweet potato donuts. They are  ridiculous. I would eat an entire basket of them if I could afford the calories. Overall a solid dinner choice. Highly recommended!",

The steak was too charred for my taste, so it felt over-powering and I couldn't really enjoy the tenderness or quality of the beef.  I was at Flemings a few weeks earlier and actually enjoyed their steak a lot more.    I came with a large group and we tried practically all the appetizers and sides.  The favorites of the night were the beef tartare, pork belly, and mac & cheese.  Everything else was bleh.  I didn't come to the steakhouse to eat sides and appetizers though, so the steak was the biggest let down.  The cocktails are pretty strong.  I had a strawberry cobbler, which is very martini like and definitely left me buzzed at the end of dinner!  The restaurant is really pretty though and the service was great.",

Long story short, we arrived at 10:05, and the hostess said they only hold reservations for 15 minutes but that we could try to find room at the bar (which there was none).  The last reservation slot was 10:45 and they don't take walk-ins, so I'm not sure how they didn't have a table available in a later slot, or one that wouldn't turn in time. The hospitality business would be so much better if it weren't for the guests, right? No effort to accommodate us--we would have gladly waited.  Also, it's more of a nightclub that serves steak. Crowded, loud, and great for people who don't want to talk to each other.",

The food itself was pretty good - was it the best steak (10oz filet) I ever had - no, but definitely decent.  It was a Saturday night, and the DJ had this 80s/90s thing going on, so it was fun reminiscing down memory lane.  A lot of the folks in our general vicinity were singing along and having a good time, including us.  Service was excellent, the waiters are quirky - they try to be your \"pal\" as well as serve you.  All in all, it was a fun night with decent food.  We were glad when a table near us cleared out so we could actually gain an additional 12\" of space.

    "text": "Wow!  This is what I have been waiting all week for in Vegas!  You can't help but feel just a little bit cooler for having eaten at STK.  From the moment you walk in, the hostesses, the managers, bartenders, servers, and diners are all outgoing, excited, high energy, beautiful, and cool people.  In fact, I was probably the most uncool person in the place - haha.  Top it off with some delicious food and some great beats coming out the speakers and a night out at STK is better than a great night in the casinos.  OK - not really, but it is a whole lot better way to spend your money than a bad night at the tables!  Since STK is in the Cosmopolitan, you would expect it to be a little on the hipster side - and that is not meant in a bad way - and it does not disappoint.  The Chandelier may be the coolest bar on the Strip and STK complements it well.  As I mentioned, the atmosphere is on the loud side with mostly old skool hip hop playing - probably not the best place if you are looking for a quiet romantic or business dinner.  Our service team was very attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating.    I had the petite filet, which was done perfectly.  The table had all kinds of sides, but I particularly enjoyed the truffle fries, mushrooms, and creamed corn.  For dessert, the server whipped up a little sampler plate for the table, which was excellent.    One downside is that they only have single bathrooms so the line was a little long - although I imagine you could find one just outside the restaurant.    Be sure to make reservations because the room is a little on the small side and be sure to bring the credit card because the bill will be a little on the big side.  If you are in Vegas to celebrate something special or you just want to live like one of the beautiful people for the night - get dressed up and head over to STK.",

Our waitress was lovely, and even though the DJ was blasting amazing music, she managed to give everyone attention and spend time reviewing our options. The petite filet was the perfect size and the best quality steak I've ever had. Better than most famous steakhouses in NYC. Then the chef came over and gave us a complimentary plate of king crab legs, which must have been cooked with butter and some kind of illegal drugs because it was the best thing I've ever tasted in my life.  Also: must get the size of jalapeno grits.  Huge recommendation if you want to have a quality steak dinner in a club atmosphere.  Note: it is very loud and crowded in here so I do not recommend this to someone looking to have a calm and quiet gathering",

This would have been ideal for dessert. The french toast was huge- a meal in itself. I then ordered a filet mignon with seared foie gras on top and bernaise sauce on the side and cream spinach as side dish. The steak was heavenly- I had an orgasm at my first bite. - the bernaise sauce was ok. and the cream spinach was very light. Not your typical cream spinach.

    "text": "STK was great!    Yes, it's a loud environment but if you're getting a bite to eat before heading over to Marquee, it's a great way to start the night.  The waiter was nice but he was doing a bit of the upsell (which is rather typical for Vegas anyway).  If you keep an eye on your budget, it will be expensive but not outrageously so.  We drank good old Las Vegas tap water, shared a bunch of appetizers and sides, didn't go with any of the expensive appetizers such as the seafood tower (something like $40/person?), etc.  The steak was great.  I generally eat a lot but at steakhouses, I like to try a lot of appetizers and side dishes and usually get really full about halfway through my steak so STK is great in that they have small, medium, and large steaks.  Yeah, the small steaks (i.e. the 7 oz filet that I got) is usually for girls but oh well.  We had a group of 10 and they were able to accomodate us in one of the private dining rooms.  It was excellent and allowed for table conversation.  I was celebrating my birthday so it was a great room for that.  With lots of drinks flowing, and everyone eating steak, sides, dessert, etc...the bill came out to roughly $150/head.  Not cheap but it would have been double that if we had gone with all of the waiter's recommendations.  Anyway, great place and an awesome way to start a night in Vegas!  P.S. It is not kid friendly because of the noise but they do not have any actual age restrictions.",

I'd also like to mention this was a Sunday and our reservation was around 9:45pm, so perhaps it was just an off night.  Bar Drinks   We arrived about 5 minutes before our table was ready and had cocktails at the bar. I had the cucumber basil drink - it was amazing!  My partner had an old fashion- it was good.     Ambiance   This place is very trendy with purple uplighting and a live DJ.  I really liked the vibe.  There isn't a view, so if you're looking for that, go to the Eiffel tower restaurant - amazing views of the Bellagio fountains there.  Food  We ordered the tuna tartar to start with.  It was good, but nothing out of this world- good presentation though.  The serve it with homemade taro chips.  They were good, but get stuck in your teeth.    They serve completely bread with melted blue cheese and an oil sauce on the side.  It was okay- a bit cold.  For our main course we each ordered the filet with crab on top and the mac n cheese side dish.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium throughout the steak, however... it lacked any sort of flavor.  Number one thing is season the food!  I've had better steaks at Outback - not joking.  The mac-n-cheese was good, but again, nothing that wowed us.... then again we're spoiled with The Porch mac-n-cheese in Dallas.  Waiter   He was... okay, but not very attentive.  I hardly ate my steak which one would think he'd ask if everything was okay, but he lacked sense in that department.  We were ready to pay up and it took awhile to get our bill.  It was our anniversary and they brought a complementary dessert with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate sauce... the waiter put his hand in it when he set it down, so no photo-op for the anniversary dessert.  Restrooms   They have one stall for men and women, and apparently when it's later in the evening, the attendant lets anyone go in the stall.  A man came out of the men's ... so I used it.  The attendant looked inside (maybe to see if there was toilet paper) and walked out and said okay it's good.  I understand that men's restrooms are ... less than desirable, but I'm in a nice restaurant, and would think the attendant would have put the seat down and cleaned the urine off the seat... but no.  I just hovered.    Summary   Perhaps l they were  having an off night, it happens, but we were highly underwhelmed.  It will take a lot to get us to go back to the Vegas location for food again.  I really wanted to like this place too- my gf said it was awesome when she went a week ago.",

My husband ordered a filet, which he said was good the menu said 8 oz. looked like a small 8 oz. (and I worked at a major steak house for 5 years) anyway the sides were just OK, totally ediable but nothing worth returning for. WAAAAAY to many other EXCELLENT options in Las Vegas.

We sat at the bar and our server/bartender was friendly, engaging, and really knowledgeable about the menu and food in general.   We split the beet salad (beets, arugula, pistachio pesto goat cheese) and the burrata salad (heirloom tomatoes, basil pesto, burrata, aged balsamic). These salads were so delicious and fresh. I can't decide which was my favorite because they were so different. The burrata was possibly the best I'd ever had.   We also had the parmesan truffle fries, which were moreso like truffle wedges - but nonetheless, very good and flavorful.   Lastly, we had the STK donuts, which were made from sweet potatoes and had a maple pecan glaze on top. I just...can't.   I should mention we had prosecco, Hennessy mojitos (don't overthink it, just get one or 5), and some other concoctions the bartender made.   Great experience and I would gladly come back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Honestly this place was subpar at best. I'm a foodie, when I travel I try to hit all the spots. I'm at pastry chef at Uchi in dallas, we base our flavors off \"umami\" 5 taste bud for deliciousness; we want every single one of our dishes to taste beyond phenomenal to every guest. I admit I look young, but the service was awful, i asked our server if they had sparkling, he said yes, \"that's our bottled water\", he came back with regular bottles of fiji water, that ended up costing $9e for something I didn't want. Money has never been an issue for delicious food, I'm also not one to complain because I've never had bad service at a fine establishment (I've waited tables in fine dining as well) First thing I noticed was the table seats from one set against from across the table to the other were so far apart, my guests across from I couldn't even hear them speak over the music and we were practically yelling..   He took forever to come take our food order, the food was basic, expensive for what you get, literally no flavor in everything, the whole table of 4 all thought the same! Everything tasted like the bare minimum amount of seasoning, I cook better at home which is the whole point of why we go out. I had the wagyu tartare, something I strongly enjoy when present on any menu, still bland, I had mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, asparagus, everything bland, I had a chicken dish, bland... this place was a disappointment, sadly chain restaurants like OUTBACK is way better.  Then, we never got checked on after we got our food, we sat there waiting after we finished for a solid 5 minutes atleast, hoping our server would at least look at us. Nope, finally I stopped an employee while they were walking past us to get our servers attention. Server comes back and I bring up that we haven't been checked on this whole time, his response, \"the person that prebusses is supposed to\" he stops, probably noticethat we haven't been prebussed and our dishes from our appetizers are still present, including our bread plate which you receive as soon as you sit down. I've never wanted to get a manager in my life at a restaurant no matter how bad the service but this time I almost did, wish I did and wanted to so bad!  I would not come here again, and anybody I know that goes to Vegas, I'll strongly tell them to not come to this place.   I also wish I got the servers name, it was Sunday night, service by the bar, maybe Latino guy, with long brown hair pulled back in a low bun.",

    "text": "Edit: After I posted my original review below, we decided to give it another try (yes, the very next day). This time we order the 10oz filet and mashed potatoes. Though it took MUCH longer to get our food this time, it was nice because it didn't feel as rushed as it did the night before. It was also much quieter and easier to talk to the person sitting next to me (this was a Tuesday compared to a Monday).   The filet was extremely tender and cooked perfectly. I ordered mine medium rare plus. Again the flavor left something to be desired (and I already knew going in that the filet isn't the most flavorful cuts but it was still better than the Sirloin which you can briefly read about in my review below).   I upgraded my 2 star rating to a 3 star because the second night was a lot more enjoyable but I definitely want to give a different steak house a try upon my next trip to Vegas. Oh yeah, the mashed potatoes were pretty damn good but could have used a little pepper and a tiny by of salt.  -------------- My 1st review from Monday evening: I had STK for my birthday a few years back and it was the best steak I had ever had. Hands down.   Decided to try it again last night and the sirloin just wasn't what I remembered. It wasn't too flavorful and the tenderness was just average. It was averagely moist and cooked a tiny bit underdone but nothing I would have complained about.   It is one of the nicer restaurants in the Cosmo and the atmosphere is terrific but it was fairly loud and crowded last night (but that is to be expected at a lot of the more popular restaurants). The noise level more or less caused my date and me to shout at each other the whole dinner. Again, nothing I would have subtracted points from my over all score over, but something to keep in mind.  The Mushroom Pot pie wasn't bad but it's basically a bowl of liquidy mushroom filling with a layer of baked dough over the top. Nothing special, and frankly a little bland.   I posted a different review saying I'm not so sure I'm going to come back to STK, but I know some restaurants have off nights so I will most likely give it another try.",

Im sure youve read about the atmosphere and i gotta say, i loved it. No other restaurant has the balls to stick a DJ in their steakhouse and play Kanye's 'youre such a f*%* hoe, i love it\" track. Its an expensive place, be ready to spend.  I got the bone in rib eye and mashed potatoes which costed like $95. The potatoes were crack and the steak wasnt too bad. Overall, i felt like it should have been like $40 -- but i get it. Perception of value. The girls i was with had tuna tartare and something else i forget..they didnt like it though.  Overall, i like it. The ambience is only something you can get away with in vegas i think. The cotton candy sparkler looked fun. Everybody seemed to be in a good mood. I'd go back but try something different. A $70 steak should have been on my top 5 but it wasnt.",

The steak was cooked perfectly and was plenty for two to share. The mac and cheese was pretty tasty. The bread that they brought out to snack on is really good too.  My only complaint is that it was too loud and too dark. It was hard to hold a conversation and we couldn't read the menu well.",

The manger gestures with his arm and hand toward my direction to give the chick a clue to help me.... but she continued her conversation until she was done then proceeded to help me with my beverage. It was kinda tacky on her part and the manager for not being more assertive to patrons standing RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!  Any ways on to my dining experience.....   This place was awesome! The upbeat atmosphere, great music, fabulous wait staff and amazing food was a dining experience made to remember.  I had a reservation made at 9:00pm, they were fast and seated us within 10 min of arriving.... the server was very very attentive and made great recommendations and was able to answer any question we had on the menu. The food came out prompt, hot and made perfectly! The desert was wonderful ( sweet potato doughnut type thing) the whole experience was really awesome and I'm glad I was able to try this place out! It's pretty busy so I would suggest a reservation a few days in advance.    If your looking for a club type dining environment this is the place no questions asked!",

We had a great time and everyone's food was delicious! I had the porterhouse and lobster tail. It was pretty pricey, but I could see why for this type of restaurant. They also came out with a complimentary dessert that said congratulations for my friend who was getting married.   Prior to coming, I was told over the phone that they can only split up 4 checks per table. So when our server, James, split up and provided everyone a bill, I was surprised as I told each girl to bring cash to avoid any confusion. It didn't totally cross my mind at the time, but I was staying at the Cosmo at the time in a wraparound suite and am also an identity member. I forgot to save my receipt and I also paid for my friend that was getting married. I could use those towards my identity reward member.   Called Cosmo to speak to them about it and they suggested I call STK to have them email me my receipt. It's been nearly 3 weeks now and have called several times and just getting the run around. Therefore the 4 star review. Other than that, it is a great atmosphere here and the food is good.  Just hopefully they get this issue for me resolved fairly soon.",

The decor was stunning, the DJ was awesome, the service was shop, but the food was severely lacking.  We ordered salads for appetizers (ceaser & wedge)... both had wilted lettuce and pretty boring taste.  Not to mention they were about $25 each.  The menu is a la cart, so we ordered filet ($60), chicken ($39), and a side of asparagus ($15).  The entrees were just ok, certainly not what you'd expect for that price point and the asparagus tastes like tree bark.  All glitz, no substance!",

I asked for his recommendation and he literally named everything on the menu.

    "text": "We arrived on time for a 9pm reservation to the loudest restaurant I have ever been in.  I'm not an old man, but I'm not a 20 something steak-loving show-off either.  I think this place was made for the latter.  Because it just isn't possible to have a meaningful conversation and once the meal is over you just want to leave so you can preserve whatever hearing you have left.  This is a noted trend among restaurants and one I don't love.  So they are \"running behind\" and we are recommended to wait in the bar and have a drink.  Drinks are not cheap here.  I'm not going to reward them for running behind by drinking more of their overpriced booze, so we waited next to the hostess stand and watched the indifferent millenials sulk around.  Now.  The steak was good and the salads were excellent.  The sides were merely ok.  I scale the wine costs by known quantities and almost everyone carries either Caymus or Silver Oak.  They had both and the Caymus was $240 a bottle.  It retails around $80-90 and is reasonable at $150-$180 in a restaurant.  $240 is insanity.  The wine by the glass was ridiculous too.    Bottom line, I just didn't feel too excited about getting my eardrums busted to eat 30 minutes after my reservation and have decent food and overpriced wine when many places close by can do a lot better by me.  Won't be back.",

The coupons by the way, look exactly like gift cards and we had no idea they ever expired.   This left a bad taste in our mouth and we probably won't be returning because of it.

The food was very good (we had filet mignons and few sides). Cocktails were delicious. Service was great as well. Ambiance is nice.  What I found surprising, is that if one would like to order a bottle of wine to split with friends, it would not make sense to order it if you would like to save a few bucks. Better off ordering a glass each of whatever you like. Unless you are picky wine drinker and want something unique.. It's not cheap place to eat for sure! But if you are on the Strip and want good steak it's worth it.  It also becomes more of a club scene later in the night. DJ was playing music while we were dining there and it definitely became more Lou's as the night went on. Just FYI if you are looking for something more quiet...",

The only reason I am not giving STK 5 Stars is I thought it was a bit pricey for what you get.  $19 Caesar Salad - yup!  I guess that's what it costs at a top tier restaurant on the strip.

After some convincing of the bride and a simple phone call, STK was easily able to seat our party of 9 for quite possible one of the greatest steaks I've ever had.   - Rib cap special: top it with truffle butter. Worth every. Damn. Penny. This steak meets me in my dreams on the regular.   - Truffle Mac and cheese: Also a regular in my food dreams. Best Mac I've ever had. Ever. Ever. EVER.   - Truffle Lobster Risotto special: decent flavor but small serving and not worth the price. A bit bland and could use more parmigiano.   The ambiance is like other STKs - very hip and lively and the perfect spot to dine before hitting the club. Only weird thing about this place is their lack of bathrooms (there's only a couple). But I guess since this is located inside a hotel casino you could easily leave the restaurant and go to bathrooms not too far outside the restaurant anyway. But the food and service here far outweighs this minor convenience. Also, if you say yes to bottled water and they start pouring you water out of FIJI bottles, that's an extra $10-15 a bottle (I don't remember exactly how much, but just be careful with this because they'll be sneaky about this).",

What makes this place unique is the dj blasting music throughout the restaurant (don't go for quiet conversation or a romantic dinner).  I wasn't there for either and enjoyed the old school r&b while dining.  The vibe was further enhanced by the great visuals.  This spot is pretty popular so there's no shortage of great looking women.  Unfortunately the food and service didn't live up to the hype.  Like so many popular restaurants in vegas they overbook like crazy.  Our casino host joined us for dinner and we still waitied an hour and a half to get seated despite our reservation.  The rib eye was just average (I prefer the rib eye at botero - especially with their chimmichuri sauce).  The tab came to ~$450 for four and that included a bottle of wine.  Good thing the meal was comped by the casino.  Wouldn't pay to dine there.  note: I dined there 2/4 which was a very busy super bowl weekend.",

The greeters at the host stand were the first indication that we were not going to have a good dining experience.  They were very generally curt and insisted our entire party was present before seating us even for drinks.  At just after 6PM seven of us were seated at a table that would have held six people comfortably, seven acceptably, but not enough room for eight yielding steak knives and talking business.  We asked the hostess to be re-seated at a table that could accommodate us once the eighth arrived.  She said the manager wouldn't allow us to be re-seated. We told her we would leave if she couldn't find a bigger table.  She seemed disinterested so we left, passing through a mostly empty dining room.

    "text": "My husband and I frequent the Cosmopolitan and ALWAYS have dinner at STK when we are in town.  This most recent visit did not disappoint, as usual.  We always ask for our \"favorite\" staff when we are in town and this time were able to see Rima, but Brenden and Grayson were not working.  Oh well, we had the pleasure of being served by Krissi (sp?) this time and she was just as fabulous as the rest of the staff!  We love STK so much not only because of the food, but the service is impeccable and the staff takes the time to get to know you and always treats you as a VIP (maybe because we are? ;)) So just a few comments about the food.  I ordered the sea bass and cleaned my plate!  It was delicious!  My husband always loves the bone-in filet and said it was amazing as always.  My husband tried the cheddar jalapeno grits and can't wait to order them again.  As for dessert, the sweet potato donuts are a must have.  We can't wait to come back!    We are planning to dine at the Los Angeles STK on September 5th as my husband will be celebrating his 50th Bday.  I am so excited to have this fabulous restaurant in our backyard and hope that the staff here is as wonderful as the staff in Vegas!  See you soon!",

Just what a Prime steak should be. The sides were also excellent, Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. The cookie with ice cream is a nice sweet dessert to end the meal.Great staff and the Hostess Valerie does a great job",

First of all she raved about the pink berry drinks. Which I believe is a rhubarb-strawberry infused vodka w/ a splash of something amazing. Definitely a good-looking ambiance.... more guys that night, which was good for the singles in our group.  We had reservations, but still had to wait, which I guess is sort of understandable since it was a Sat night...  I have to say I thought it was very cool when the manager came to our table with this enormous bottle of Cristal champagne from my friend's fiance... one of the girls asked how much the bottle was... pretty astronomical. The food was phenomenal; my friend and I shared the filet mignon.  Absolutely delicious!  I have to say that I enjoyed the vibe of the place and people... outstanding food but also a super cool place to hang out with friends for drinks. Love, Love, Love this place!  Can't wait to go back! I would have given this place 5 stars, but because despite having reservations, we still had a painfully long wait.",

As others have noted, the looks is sleek and cool - very vegas but the music is unbearably loud and we ended up having to shout at each other to be heard. The tables are a joke, way too small and uncomfortable.  Food was terrible, meat was dry, tuna fishy. Wine list was overpriced and underwhelming.  I've been to the Beverly Hills location and it's wonderful, so this must be a Vegas thing.  My recommendation, try Mastro's in the nearby City Center - far superior atmosphere, food and drinks.",

The food was great too! They serve warm bread with a green pesto oil sauce. I ate the creamy mashed potatoes, risotto and grilled ahi. The mashed potaotes were so rich and delicious.

I wouldn't mind this if the fries & lobster mac & cheese had any extra pizzazz compared to their normal versions, but this wasn't the case. just a regular old mac and cheese with hardly any lobster! needless to say, i was very unimpressed by STK. this place is stuffy, overpriced ($600 for 6 people, 3 girls & 3 guys), and not sufficiently yummy...best part about it was the bachelorpad-yacht feel of the interior...if you're into that kind of look.",

    "text": "We had one of the most fun dining experiences here last Saturday night.  We were celebrating my friend's Bachelorette and dinner at STK just kept the party going for us.  STK is definitely NOT a quiet steakhouse.  It is a straight up PARTY!  We waited in the bar area while our table for 7 was getting set up.  We had a couple drinks and within 3 tracks I was in love with the DJ.  Yes, a DJ, spinning in a round booth smack dab in the middle of the restaurant.    After about 10 minutes a hostess seated us at our booth.  Not long after our waiter Martin came by.  When Martin was explaining the days specials I literally stopped him as JAY Z starting pumping through the speakers and I belted out to him while waving my hands up and down... \"TURN MY MUSIC Hi-Hi-Hi-Hi-GHER!!\"  It was epic... but you had to be there!  We all had a chuckle and proceeded to order.  Some of the tasty craft cocktails we had throughout our meal were the Cucumber Stiletto, the Lemoncello & raspberry martini, a Champagne with hibiscus flower in it, and Iced Tea Cocktail.  A wonderful warm bread was brought out to the table.  It was soft and warm and yummo.  It had a light dipping sauce with it. Soon after our starters came out.  The Heirloom tomato and Burrata with pesto was good and i was very surprised at how good the Crab and Avocado salad was.  I was not even thinking of ordering it but I'm glad we did.  It was reminiscent of a spring roll almost.  It was fresh and wonderful.  I wish we got two.  Our main courses came out and mine was the crowd favorite.  I got the short rib and it was lovely.  There were a couple orders of the sea bass,  a filet, and the tuna tartar.    I LOVE sides... see my \"last meal\" in the about me section.   STK's side dishes were delicious.  We shared the corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, the fries, green beans, and mac n cheese.   We had a really fun experience here, somewhere along the ride, \"SHOTS!\" was played by the DJ and servers were coming out with trays full of shots of alcohol and handed them out to our table among others.  There was also an older white guy that was getting DOWN on the couches.  He literally hoped up on his booth and table and was rocking out to \"Play that funky music\"  Super Fun, Super Pricey, but it's Vegas Baby.... \"You're so money and you don't even know it!\"",

    "text": "This time that I went back the food was just mediocre. It wasn't as good as all the times that I had been back. The quality of the food was a little lackluster and the service was really bad this time around.  We started off with the the seafood platter and it seemed like they gave us some really small pieces of king crab legs. For $40 per person... I expected some lobster and some bigger king crab legs. There were a ton of shrimp on the plate so we were over the shrimp.  We then asked our waitress what the special was for the night. She told us that it was a Chilean sea bass special topped with 2 giant shrimps. We thought that was a weird special...seafood topped with seafood? It was around $60 something per plate which was a little pricey, but we did order 2 of these.  We also ordered a tomahawk steak for 4 to share and then some sides to go with our dinner. Everything else was decent. I thought our tomahawk ribeye was a little tough compared to the other steaks that I had before at STK... For $100, I expected it to be better.  We ordered mushrooms, corn pudding and Mac and cheese for our sides. I wished that the waitress told us our main dish the Chilean Seabass came with mushrooms so we could of picked a different side, but she didn't.  When the bill finally came. I noticed that the Chilean Seabass was charged and then there were those 2 shrimps that were charged as add on's. I thought that was very fishy. I think she told us that it was included in the special so she could charge us more and make more tip. She charged us $6 per shrimp as an add on for 2 Chilean Seabass specials. That's an additions $24 that we didn't even want. We didn't touch any of the shrimp because we already ate so many of them on our seafood platter.   We did end up complaining about that and they did end up taking it off...but next time be careful and watch of for their tricky ways to add on things to you bill!   She was super slow and we had to flag down people every single time to get even our water or drinks refilled!   For a $500 dinner for 4 people that didn't drink. It was just an okay experience this time around.",

From the sounds of everyone else, they enjoyed their food a lot more than I did.  The house bread was great, I tried a salad that was very good, but the steak itself just wasn't anything to write home about.  On top of that, the restaurant had a club-like atmosphere with a DJ spinning some pretty good tracks, people were dancing, and I even saw sparklers when someone bought a bottle.  I gotta say it's weird when you're trying to eat a meal and talk to your friends to be yelling.  That said, this would be a great spot to go to if you were looking to party with your friends but didn't want the crowds and super overpriced drinks of a club.  Probably won't be back anytime soon, but I don't think I'm STK's target market.",

The food was great to be fair and the waitress was great but the bad taste had been left by the wait. Overbooking when there are a bunch of trade shows in town is not cool. Also having strippers from crazy horse walking through restaurant was poor taste.",

    "text": "I LOVE the ambiance of this place! It seems to be a pretty happening/tredy restaurant! This is probably my 2nd time going to a steakhouse... but the difference between this one and some other establishments like Morton's is the music and atmosphere. You definitely feel like you're already in a club dancing away, but you're at a restaurant at the same time which is a pretty cool idea (they have DJ's playing live) Love how they gave us their delicious bread that was served in their steal cast irons with a side of their Pesto Basil dip - seriously addicting, I think we had like 3 orders of their bread before our entrees came in hahaha.. can't help it if it's super good!  I shared the Short Ribs with Carrot Butterscotch, Celery, Cipollinis and the side Parmesan Truffle Fries.. the Short Ribs were very tender and flavorful and the fries are not your typical fries you get at some bar. They're cut almost like steak fries but in almost a perfect rectangle.. You can totally taste the truffle oil goodness! Both were served pipping hot (which is a major plus!)  Just keep in mind that since this is a steakhouse, it's going to be pretty expensive, that's why it's good to share some of the dishes so it won't cost you your wallet ;)   Servers were pretty attentive, filled up our waters, and anything else we needed.. but what was even better was how our waiter gave us all complimentary Lemon Drop shots as dessert! Super sweet of him! :)",

I think it's perfect for a date night...perfect if you're hung over, it's overall perfect if you look amazing or look terrible because the lighting makes anyone look fantastic lol.  We did not have reservations, we just went right around the time they opened and was taken to our table immediately at walk in. The servers were dressed kind of slutty, which threw me off a bit because the joint seems \"classy\"...a lot of working stiffs sitting at the bars and tables with suits on and the waitress comes by with a short, black tacky dress on....kinda throws you off but whatever. Our waiter was actually great; very attentive and laid back so it made the experience overall much better. The food was the star of the show though....I like how the menu was set up. I was in the mood for seafood so I opted to try the seafood platter with cheesy jalapeno grits ( yes it was a perfect combination). It was absolutely delicious. My husband had the duck con fit and it reminded me of duck bacon ( yum) so It was like a party in my mouth. I recommend trying everything on the menu if you can afford it lol",

The club sandwich, and salmon were my favorites. The hostesses were attentive in holding my cell phone behind the counter while I was taking pictures, I had thought someone swiped it, but the girls were observant enough to notice I was not paying attention as I had my picture taken. Thank You for holding in a safe location for me!! The manager with the short black hair, was too sweet and took time to take our pictures as well. A fun vibe after church .",

    "text": "Got here yesterday, 6PM reservation with my girlfriend for her birthday. We have been seated right after we got there, and unlike other people said, it was not as loud as I thought, not as dark, and it really provided the great lighting with seating. What we ordered was Blue Cheese Iceberg, Fillet Mignon Medium Rare, Sirloin Medium Rare, Doughnuts for the dessert. I was been served by Chrissy, and bussed by Carlos, they were both attentive and happy. They were very informative and gave us some suggestions and recommendations. As other review said, complimentary bread came out, hard outside, but soft inside, it really was great starter to appetite me and my girlfriend. Iceberg came out, but I am not really a fan of vegetable, so I would not really rate this since it was my girl's choice anyways.. Main steak came out, and I would say, IT WAS COOKED INTO PERFECTION! My sirloin was juicy, crispy outside, soft and tender inside, which I was really willing to have. My girl's fillet was as well tender, and just cooked perfectly. Considering that fillet is the part that is only meat without a lot of fat or muscle, it did not have as much juice as sirloin, but it was just great. It definitely can be the best steak that I have ever had. We were bussed consistently, and Carlos gave us some suggestion to have doughnuts for the dessert, and I really am thankful that he has recommended me that, cause that doughnut was the killer for the meal that I had; I know it sounds funny that steakhouse sells doughnuts for dessert, but trust me, you won't ever regret.   Overall, I had perfect experience. Great ambience, not too loud, not to crowded, amazing and very attentive server and the busser, great food, till the dessert. Was it worth 150 for two? Hell yeah it was. It was a bit pricy, but I mean, we are in the strip and we are in fine dining restaurant with fine dining experience. I would not be able to come here as often as chipotle or TGIF, but if I have any special occasion, this place will easily become my first option by that time.  Tips : If you do not like loud music, make a reservation for the time right after they open the door, from 5:30PM to 7:30PM. DJs will be coming out at 7:30PM.",

I wanted her I have a nice dinner at a nice place and she likes steak so I figure STK seems like a nice place and has good reviews on yelp. Well, yelpers did me wrong. The food was so bleh. The steak was nothing special. I mean it was very bland and for being a steak house the filet mignon was just whatever. We couldn't even eat it without sauce. And I mean all 5 of us. The sides were ok...we got the potatoes, creamed corn and broccolini. The ambience is as most yelpers stated...very loud, very dark. I didn't mind that aspect at all, but the food was so sub par I felt like it was a waste of our time and money. The service was pretty good but that's about it. If you're looking for a nice steak house that has good steaks, don't come here. Try craft steak or something.",

    "text": "Completely undeserved top 10 best steak houses in Vegas.  Cool, dark, modern twist on the classic steak house.  Arrived on a Monday night at about 7 to a virtually empty restaurant only to be told a high top would be available in 15 minutes or over an hour to sit at one of the many empty, albeit supposedly reserved actual tables.... The tables remained empty the entire time we were there.  SMH.  Terrible hostess faux pas.  We actually walked out but by wife convinced me to stay due to the reviews.  So we stayed.... and sat at a high top (IMO an incredibly lame seating arrangement for a steak house).  A fairly appealing menu with some eclectic twists to the classics.  The single loaf blue cheese and butter topped bread was delicious.  Blue cheese is a risk but it was well balanced and offset nicely by the texture of the warm bread.  Drinks were extremely expensive (19/per if memory serves) and, while technically well executed, just didn't scream 'elite martini'.  Don't remember the name, something floral.  Apps weren't memorable enough to review.  My wife got a garlic butter steak that was beautifully cooked to a near perfect medium rare.  The symmetry of the cook could have been better, and it what I would expect from a $50+ cut at a top 10 restaurant.  The mac and cheese was robust and had a bread crumb topping that was present enough to add a bit of texture but not so much as to take away from the sharpness of the cheese.  Another well done dish.....  Then came the single most disappointing things that can ever, ever, ever happen in a high end steak house..... a nearly raw del monico cut that looked as pitiful as the skill with which it was cooked.  An embarrassingly poor cut of sub-quality meat clearly cooked too hot for too short a period of time.  I was appalled.  I LOVE steak... good steak.  This was as far opposite of good as steak can be.  Sadly, I have had a more satisfying steak eating experience at Sizzler.  When I finally expressed my disappointment after far too many minutes of not eating the bovine disaster, the delightful waitress whisked the steak away.  After several minutes some guy brought back the re-fired (re-fired 76.00 14-oz cut of meat) and waited...with a flashlight for me to cut into it.  Completely frustrated and not wanting to cause any more of a scene (you should have seen my wife's face) I acquiesced to consume the now woefully overdone and charred piece of now flavorless protein.  When the waitress came back she saw the steak and (bless her heart) grabbed it off the table and walked angrily back to go give the chef a piece of her mind.  Absolutely awesome way for her to handled it (yes, it was reflected in her tip).  So what I was so desperately wanting to be the crown jewel of sustenance from a Las Vegas staple turned out to be a grossly overpriced disappointment.  I am envious of those that had a great experience there.  I left dropping over 250.00 for the two of us (yes, they took the steak off the bill....and it was still pricey).  My expectations were not at all met and really wished they were.  The meat failure earned it a one star but the other items and the waitress added a (reluctant) second star.  How in the hell can a steak house screw up a steak that badly???",

    "text": "From when we arrived we should have just left. The hostess sets that initial mood. We arrived 30 minutes early. We were told we couldn't be seated until everyone was there, it's one of those policy places. Bad. Ok so we have 30 minutes for everyone to get here, which wasn't mentioned when they left a message in my room or when I called them back to confirm that day, so please prepare our table so at our reservation time there's no waiting longer. Right? Wrong! 30 minutes later we were sat. No room at bar to get a drink or sit so it was an agonizing hour since all is ladies were dressed fab wearing 6 inch heels. After all, we are staying at the Cosmo, short walk to the restaurant. Guests of the hotel don't receive special treatment FYI.   I ordered one of the suggested specials,  filet topped with Bernaise, king crab and asparagus. Also featured was a risotto with shaved white truffles and mushrooms, it was yummy but too salty. My steak was so dry and Paine it was over cooked, asked for Med rare, got Done all beige inside, I sent it back. Very nicely I asked but when it came back a pretty big guy with a bad attitude asked me to cut into and show him if it was ok. I guess they get jerks in here so they need a bouncer to intimidate them so you get the same, awkward! I'm with 3 other couple all not on a budget so wasn't trying for 2 extra bites of a dry steak! Came back perfect! Yay!   Ok so where's my King Crab legs?? I asked our server when I chose this featured dish are they split so I could just pull them out of the shell, I'm in a Versace dress I don't want to man-handle a crustacean! She smiled and laughed and said of course!! We do all the work. Perfect! Nope. When I reminded her I didn't get my crab legs she said yes you did, they are in the Bernaise! Silly me. Those couple of little specks of unidentified, because they were tasteless, was actually the crab! Huh?! We discussed split shells, perfect chance for her to say theres a teaspoon of chopped crab, probably canned, in your sauce. I usually don't do sauce if I expect a great steak, no need to smother natures perfection right!?! It was the crab legs I was after, oh wait, now I think about it!!!! Omg, they even called it Surf N Turf!!! Damn, if I'd remembered that then I would have asked to speak w management. So that is sooo misleading!!!  The best thing about dinner was the company of good friends, the funny server assistant, and the 2 bottles of great wine I brought. I won't be returning. STK used be a great dinner but this third visit tells me it's now a typical spot in Vegas that gets popular and goes cheap. Time to turn it over Cosmo, need a new steakhouse!",

My girl and me were contemplating where to find a great steak in Vegas for our vacation and found this spot. Very trendy place with a simple, but eye-popping menu.  Recommend: Seafood Platter Appetizer. Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, and lobster tail. Really good. Also, Filet steak(med/rare) with foie gras.   Stay away from: Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Taste like plain mac-cheese with frozen pieces of lobster mixed in there. Good, but not worth the $30 price tag.   If you are a late diner, they have a DJ so the restaurant is loud. We went during opening dinner hours, around 6:30pm, so we didn't have to battle the noise. BUT, ITS VEGAS, SO PARTY UP!",

    "text": "Warning: LONG REVIEW. SORRY =)  I was surprised to read that a lot of people think this place is \"overrated\". It is Vegas and a restaurant in one of the fanciest hotels on the strip so what do you expect?  Great service and a great atmosphere comes with a price.  Maybe I am bias because I didn't take care of the bill though =)   Definitely a vibrant bar scene, drinks in hand and socializing. The scene here is kind of confusing though.  I would say a mixed crowd, definitely older.  It is a nice getaway from the typical Vegas scene with the large groups of barely dressed girls club hopping and shuffling from guestlist to guestlist.  It seems like a great place for romantic dinners, great for girls night, good for groups, \"CHEERS\" with the guys, but then you have some people dancing on chairs and tables as if it's a club?  The music and live dj adds to the whole ambiance but it's interesting when people get kind of rowdy.  But alcohol does that to all of us huh?   Food.  Everything we had was delicious.    wine -- great recommendation  bread -- love the green sauce  beef carpaccio -- thinnest slices of beef I've ever had!  Great texture and the flavors mixed well    foie gras french toast -- if you eat this wrong, it'll taste wrong.  you have to get a little bit of everything in the same bite and chew it all together.  it's surprising, i loved it  pumpkin ravioli -- some people might not like the texture of pumpkin, but i love it!  it's a refreshing taste in my opinion  organic filet mignon and bone in filet -- both were delicious and cooked exactly how i wanted it, can't complain, i think the bone in is better, but both were great   lobster was good, but not stand out in comparison to the rest of our meal  sides: we got the mac and cheese, sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie, and spiced maple carrots.  the standouts were the mushroom pot pie and sweet corn pudding  dessert: the sorbets come out in small scoops and small cones (SO CUTE, but careful, i dropped the scoop a few times), the cheesecake pops and chocolate mousse were okay.  I don't remember what else we had, but none of them were standout or maybe we were TUMMY STUFFED.   Recommendations: mushroom pot pie, foie gras french toast, bone in filet.  Also the music seems to get louder as the night got later so take that into consideration, like an earlier dinner date vs trendy rowdier scene later",

But I must say that for the waiting time it was SO NOT WORTH IT. The steak came out burned and it had fat.. YUCK and the service was Super Slow. You would think that for the amount of money that you are paying you could at least get a good steak. I must say. I enjoyed my Steak and Lobster dinner WAY more at TGIF at NEW Orleans for 13.99 the next day.. Would highly recommend.. there instead of STK..",

Anyway, ordered the ribeye steak (one of the more expensive steaks in the house) which was very nervy and fatty with very little flavor. One of my other girlfriends did too and had the same to say! The side dishes- mac n cheese and creamed spinach were ok. The mushroom pot pie was pretty good. The feedback from the rest of the group was that the less expensive plates were pretty good. The service was also pretty good and is the reason why I'm giving STK 3 STARS. I don't plan on going back though the next time I'm in Vegas. Gallagher's in New York New York is much better n the prices are comparable.",

You can be a restaurant or a loud nightclub,  but surely not both at the same time.    They also don't honor reservations. Our reservation was for party of 9 for 10:30 pm, at we showed up at 10:25 pm.  They unapologetically told us it would be a 25 minute wait, and then seated us at 11:05 pm.  So we walked out and ate elsewhere.    There are much better places to enjoy a good steak in Las Vegas... N9NE, CUT, BOA, Charlie Palmer, to name a few.    In summary, I would consider STK a huge waste of time unless you are literally stranded at the Cosmopolitan and already slightly deaf.",

    "text": "Well, I live in Los Angeles and we go to the STK here all the time so when we took a weekender to Vegas we decided to try the STK at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Our reservations were at the opening hour of the restaurant since it was a busy Saturday and we got squeezed in last minute. Upon arrival (10 minutes early for our reservation) we were told by the hostess that the restaurant was CLOSED and she advised us wait OUTSIDE until she opened the doors. REALLY?? There are a ton of lounge chairs inside for patrons waiting to be seated... i.e. US!!! Well we were shocked when we FINALLY walked in to see about 12 people that were enjoying cocktails at the bar inside that had OBVIOUSLY showed up early too... It just ruined our entire meal that this HORRIBLE hostess pulled such a stunt. (btw, STK, this took place on the evening of February 25th, 2012).  The ambience was great the music was groovy and the crowd was beautiful like usual, but after being treated like that we were we just really didn't have a great experience.. We will N.E.V.E.R. come back to STK Las Vegas again, in Los Angeles our service HAS always been remarkable, I find it hard to swallow that this little girl would/could treat customers that are willing to pay $80 for a steak in this fashion... I will say that the food was good, but DEFINITELY stay away from the \"seafood platter\" complete letdown..",

I ordered the blue cheese salad, carmelized asparagus and Kobe sliders as my entree which was met with icy silence from our, admittedly, awesome server who went to NECI. The asparagus was wonderful, the salad was salad-like and I was embarrassed to ask them to burn my sliders and they came out 'medium' if medium means purple. Apparently this is how you're supposed to eat these, so no deduction for me being a shut-in. We said no to dessert so our server brought a platter with fried sweet potato doughnuts, salted caramel gelato and ginger snaps. This increased her tip by twice what the dessert would have cost us so props to NECI. The people at my table who more closely resembled adults all were thrilled with their Filet, Sole and pumpkin ravioli. My seasonal boycott of all things pumpkin prevented me from sampling. I had three vodkas to close.",

This is one of those places that would be enjoyable for a birthday bash or a special occasion (not a romantic dinner with your loved one). The food is actually pretty good.  I would definitely recommend the truffle Parmesan chips and tomato with burata salad for entrees/sides. For a main, I had the fillet medallion which was cooked to absolute perfection.   I love the Cosmopolitan and have stayed here for the past 2 years whenever in Vegas. STK is a must visit for anyone in the area. The concept of a steakhouse in the middle of a nightclub is novel and something that needs to be experienced at least once in your life, but warning this is NOT for everyone...my boyfriend was not a fan of the loud music.",

    "text": "I honestly do not understand the negative reviews. if you are looking to have a quiet and boring dinner experience then I'm not sure what you are doing in Las Vegas and this restaurant is definitely not for you. We had an amazing time the food and service was incredible. Eddy was our server and he was so awesome! So energetic, fun and knowledgeable. We started with the shellfish platter the flavor of all the seafood was all so good, so fresh so succulent mmmm... this honestly was so filling it would have satisfied us for dinner. Did we stop there though? Nope! next we got the Wagyu, I have never had Wagyu before and OMG!!! Now I know what I have been missing it was incredible!  It literally melts in your mouth! Honestly if you have an opportunity to order this, do it! You deserve to treat yourself! We all ordered a steak as well I got the 10 oz filet, medium rare with king crab Oscar topping. The steak was cooked so perfectly it honestly did not need the topping but the crab was very delish as well. All of our steaks were so perfect we all like medium rare but my brother in law ordered a bone in and Eddy our server suggested he ordered medium due to the bone it would come out a little more on the rare side if he were to go with medium rare. Eddy was on point with his suggestion. We also got the creamy Yukon potatoes, green beans and sweet corn pudding. We were so full with all the food and wine we were consuming! But we were having a blast and kept moving our bodies because the atmosphere was so fun they were playing the jams! A mix of 80's 90's and 00's, I have seen complaints of the noise level of the music and honestly I could hear what everyone in my table was saying and even our server. Okay so we are singing along to our fave songs dancing while our plates are being removed from our table and we are so in the moment I did not notice they were laying out small plates in front of us we had a confused look on our face, what Is this for? And then Eddy brings out 2 shots for each of us and then they bring out desserts!! Omg!! Donuts with this glaze, whip cream and pecans! And a Panna cotta with strawberry topping! I think we all said at the same time \"Eddy! What are you doing to us!!\" Lol, We were so full how are we going to eat this! Well those 2 shots that were brought out,I am not sure what the first was I just drank it and the second was ginger beer, Eddy said this would help make us feel less full or something to that effect I had a lot of wine by now :) it must have worked because we dug right into the desert which was so incredible it was like a party in my mouth.   Our whole time there we just were amazed with each bite, each sip, each song and each encounter we had with Eddy. We were headed to the club later that night so we had to run but I honestly did not want to leave and I had so much more fun at STK then I did at the night club. Thank you so much Eddy and STK for the amazing experience!!!!",

However, as a waiter or server, I think it's important to keep your composure with somewhat of a smile on your face (even if you're dying on the inside).  Unfortunately, our waiter seemed incredibly flustered and utterly miserable from the minute we saw him.  I felt bad for the guy!  Service, I can forgive more easily.  Quality steak at a steakhouse, on the other hand, is a different story.  I ordered a small Filet Medallion cooked medium rare.  It came out just seconds away from being medium.  The meat was decent but not as tender as I'd like it.  It was just...okay.    The Parmesan Truffle Fries were a lot better.  I should have just ordered this and a salad.  They were crispy and rich in cheesy truffle flavors.    For the price tag of the evening,  I'll pass next time.",

    "text": "What a Supper Club in Vegas should be.  Had a ball here celebrating my Birthday!    SMH at the folks fighting a huge line to get into the \"Club\" nearby. Me and my buddy strolled into STK, seated ourselves at the bar and proceeded to have a nice dinner and lots of bubbly while a DJ kept the place jumping.  Ambiance is cool if you are there for dinner or just want to be a barfly or just lounge. It may be too noisy if you are planning on a quiet dinner on a weekend night due to the DJ, but you were already expecting that because it's STK, right?  I like this location as much as STK L.A. and more than STK ATL (FULL DISCLOSE: I do need more trips to this one - only been here twice) .  Definitely recommend this place for your pre-game festivities, or your whole game if you don't wanna do the high-end club thing in LV.",

    "text": "Food is amazing and delicious. Also very expensive, so don't let that catch you by surprise. Notable things on my last visit, their mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese side dishes were extremely yummy. I also really enjoyed their shrimp appetizer (I forget what it was called). I had the skirt steak and my boyfriend had the big eyed tuna. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly. The seared big eyed tuna was only good until we asked for some lemon slices and squeezed those onto it, then it was delicious too haha.  Service is great. Super attentive and helpful. Ask for anything and they'll probably bring it to you.  One star off though because both times that my boyfriend and I went, we went after 9pm and I guess it turns into some sort of club/restaurant place. I'm not a fan of extremely loud music playing while I'm eating that gets in the way of talking to the people I'm eating with. The waiter literally had to shout at us in order to be heard, which I think is just absurd. I'm all for a young, hip, and party atmosphere but I really think the music could be turned down just a little to make it a little easier to hear the people around you while you eat.",

    "text": "Chose STK as a nice birthday dinner for our friend. Of all the nice steakhouses I've eaten in Vegas, STK is the only one who did not acknowledge the special occasion reason noted on our open table reservations.   I had the 7oz filet medallions medium which was not cut so it left me a bit confused. I figure medallions would be sliced when served. It was nothing special. Not juicy. Not melt in your mouth delicious. It was just a piece of filet.   Birthday boy had a 10oz filet medium rare with the foie gras topper. The foie gras was a pretty generous portion. He savored his meal saying it was nice and buttery.   The other 2 guys eating healthy chose the ahi tuna rare which was a big portion. It could've been shared between the two of them. They said it was good and fresh.   The sides: first off the server told us we should all order our own bc it was too small to share. At $11 a side you wonder wth? Not family style like most steakhouses?! So we got the broccolini, green beans, and mushroom potpie. When the sides came out I admit they were small but not so small you couldn't share. So the guys felt hustled by our server haha. The broccolini wasn't bad, the jalepeno gave it a spicy kick. I liked the soy glaze on the green beans. Then the mushroom potpie... Oh man! Yes I have to agree with other reviews this is a must order for sides. Another item on this trip that was worth one of my diet cheats. The cream sauce was rich but not overpowering and the mushrooms are a mixture of various kinds which was neat. The crust was flaky and light.   Overall I will not be going back to STK. I'd prolly only go back for the mushroom potpie. Nothing spectacular but a decent dinner. Birthday boy enjoyed it. He also enjoyed the complimentary bread and parsley butter. I had a tiny piece and it was good!   So there you have it. STK was only good for mushroom potpie and free bread hence the reason for no pics bc it wasn't worthy. Ha!",

I remember the server saying something about the steak being $60-100.  kind of forgot.  all I remember was she said minimum 4oz so I got 6oz.  Chilean sea bass - was very good!  the texture was great and the mushrooms and veggies was good.  I didn't get the truffles on top so that saves about $20.  lobster mashed potatoes - IT WAS THE MOST DISGUSTING THIG I'VE EVER HAD.  it didn't even taste like potatoes.  we didn't even eat it. I should have asked to return it but my friend said it was weird.  and when I saw the bill it was $30!  ughhhh waste of money.  I also looked at the bill and the Kobe was $240!!!!! OMGGGG DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BE THAT MUCH.  it was so tiny (as you can see from the pic).  good though but Mastro's has their kobe $125 for 10oz.  I think that's wayyyy more worth it than STK kobe.",

However, i still have to give props because the manager allowed me to show our birthday boy the cake and let him blow the candles out. But was unable to serve my 300.00 cake . I was so angry, the manager could tell so he compensated my party of 14 free shots.  Which is why I'm doing 4 stars. It's not questionable the service is absolutely perfect.

I am talking about loud music, girls in short skimpy dresses, and a DJ spinning and scratching the record (do they still play records at nightclubs?). Imagine taking a bite of your steak and then getting up and shaking your hips and throwing your hands up in the air (while holding the knife and fork). Then you go back and cut a piece of your foie gras and repeating the process. Oh yaaaaa.. boom boom boom, chew chew chew. :)  Their in-house made bread with blue cheese and cilantro oil is delicious. It comes all warm and gooey. But if you don't eat it in 3 min, the bread will be as dry as an old woman's .... umm ya it gets super dry.   Seriously though, STK has a pretty decent food but expensive. The cheapest cut is their skirt steak which starts around $40. All the sides are extra. Tiny piece of foie gras is $18. I am not a big fan of truffle fries but we tried them and they were pretty good. As I said before, the atmosphere is very loud. To the point that you have to yell for the other person.   Oh and it's usually pretty busy at around 7, 8 ... We went there on a Monday at 7 and we didn't get a table until 9:15.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. I had really high expectations for STK, especially at their price point. Overall, I was not impressed. The seating is pretty crammed together and the music was so loud that you could hardly have a conversation with the person sitting across from you without yelling at them. It almost felt like we were eating at a nice cafeteria. We tried the Tuna Tartare, which was fantastic and our steaks were okay, but nowhere near worth their $70 price. We tried the notorious donuts for desert and they didn't disappoint. They are different, but very good.  It also felt like they over-bussed the tables. It made the meal feel rushed and definitely took away from the experience.",

The first issue could be that I don't eat steak but ... ah ... sue me.   I started the night off with a glass of wine. It wasn't bad but not my favorite because they really didn't have a sweet wine. Next the waiter bright out bread with a pesto sauce. The bread was very good. The sauce added a nice touch to it. After wine and bread we placed our orders for entrees. I had fish( the fish itself came with small diced potatoes with a lemon caper sauce) with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. The fish wasn't bad. The creamed spinach wasn't that good. I absolutely love Ruth's Chris Creamed Spinach and when I saw it on the STK menu I got really excited. I guess I assumed it would taste like Ruth's Chris and it didn't and I was disappointed. The mashed potatoes were just mashed potatoes, nothing special.   Overall STK was just mediocre for me. It was nothing special. I feel for the amount of money you spend its not worth it. I like a expensive meal every now and then but I want it to be good as well. I doubt I would come back.",

Cosmo is one of my favorite casinos and STK is one of my favorite restaurants to frequent when I get the chance to! I've had soooo many amazing meals and memories at this location! The whole staff is great! From the people who great you as you enter to the servers, food runners, bussers, bartenders, I feel like everyone seems happy to be working for this restaurant. Rebecca has been helping me book my reservations, she's amazing! The last two times I've went waitress Leslie has been our server and was awesome! She's so friendly and easy to talk to! She has great suggestions for the menu! Our food runner was awesome too! His name is Markus and always seems to be working when I visit. They are both great people! I've literally never had a bad dinning experience when coming to this must stop Vegas restaurant! Always leave satisfied with a full belly  AMAZING",

I asked for a side and was given cold blue cheese. The lobster Mac and cheese was luke warm and the creamed spinach was not creamy at all. At the competitor's, the plates are hot, food is hot and the drinks are plentiful. I would not recommend this place. Go to Mastro's or Cut for a really great steak and amazing side dishes. The lobster Mac and cheese was a waste of money. Small noodles and barely any lobster.",

It certainly fits right in with the character of the Cosmopolitan and I will say that it did not let me down.  The music was a little loud, but not unreasonable considering  you are in Vegas where everything is over the top.   The food left a little to be desired. Great variety in the menu for a steakhouse and priced at the very high end of what one would expect but I certainly did not get the wow factor I was hoping for. Service was good, but I did not feel like it was personal or close to over the top....almost like we were just another table of 4 on their assembly line for the night.   Also, a little annoying is the fact that the bathroom is a single. It's not cool when you are at a supposed high-end restaurant and you have to wait 10 minutes (even longer for women) standing in a dark, back hallway to take a leak b/c 4 others are ahead of you in line.",

We started with the tuna tartare which was average at best. At 19 bucks that tuna should have rocked as loud as the music they are play. I had the sirloin steak which was tough and fatty. Sounds like a girl i dated in high school. Ughhhh The side dish was the Mac n Cheese which was good. I will say the service was very good. No complaints there.

It was light and fresh and the melon added a very unique and delicious element to the crab. A must try!  - Beef Carpaccio: (special of the night) Thin slices of beef, shaved parmesan cheese and a balsamic drizzle - Melt in your mouth delicious! The balsamic balanced the saltiness of the parmesan cheese.  - Wagyu Filet: (special of the night) - Medium, and cooked to perfection! The crustiness of the outside was a great compliment to the tenderness of the inside.  - Chilean Sea Bass (special of the night) - The sea bass was perfectly flakey and laid on a bed of wild mushrooms.   - Mushroom Pot Pie - This was DIVINE! The textures of wild mushrooms and the cream sauce was great with the crustiness of the pie shell.  - Mac and Cheese - I have to admit, I didn't think this would be very special, but to my surprise, it was phenomenal! It came out with a bread crumb/cheese crust and because I'm big on \"texture,\" the creamy, cheesy shells were a great balance.  - Bread Pudding - Rich and Decadent! The best part were these little crunchy things added on top. They looked and tasted like Cap N Crunch cereal :)  Service was top-notch and we were treated like royalty!",

I enjoyed the atmosphere, got a really comfortable both for two and was surprised with a beautiful birthday treat at the end of it all. Sparklers and everything! It was such a beautiful experience, especially after enjoying some filet and drinks. It was extremely memorable and that made me really happy for doing so.  I came back again last night and made a reservation for my boyfriend's 25th birthday. He's never been to STK before and I was excited to have them go all out since they asked if the reservation was for a special occasion or not and I confirm through the phone and in person, it's his birthday.  The service was great. We enjoyed our food! He ordered the filet 10oz and I the Colorado lamb chops with a salad and yellowtail starter. I also selected their strawberry cobbler cocktail, which was really sweet and not too strong. Just how I like it.  Everything was great! Our meal was perfect and just right. My boyfriend enjoyed the place! Towards the end, I was hoping for that same experience I once had, but it didn't happen so we just asked for the check.  I don't want to sound entitled to anything, but I wished they went out of their way to have surprised him with a small treat. That's mainly the only reason I choose this place to treat him out for his bday dinner. I was kinda bummed out it didn't happen. I wanted him to feel extra special, but it's okay. At least everything else was good.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband for dinner while we were on our honeymoon. Our reservation was for 9:45pm and we checked in about 9:15pm. We were sat fairly quickly to a table. Our server was nice, I don't remember her name.. she helped us pick a glass of wine.   Pros: The steak was delicious. My husband ordered a ribeye and I ordered a filet. Mine was ordered medium and it came medium rare, almost rare in some spots. I ate it without complaint and it was still tasty. They played music (very loudly I may add lol) but it had a nice vibe to the place. It kinda felt like a club to be honest, my husband and I joked that we had to read lips to understand each other but we did not mind.  Cons: The food is expensive, but I am sure you would know that going into the place. Our sides were stone cold. We ordered mashed potatoes and lobster mac. The lobster was raw and we did not eat the mac. Service was very mediocre. We were there an hour and a half before we got our food. People that sat near us came and left before we even ate. For the price, I was very disappointed.   I would not return based on the price, service, the cold food and wrong temp of my steak. I would expect much more for spending $300 on 2 glasses of wine, 2 steaks, & 2 sides to share.",

Our server Brandon was great with all his recommendations on the Dry Aged Delmonico, Paloma, and desserts. The Peacan donut is fire! You have to finish your meal with the donut!  The entire staff and management are very hospitable and welcoming. Highly recommend to everyone!",

The bread that you get before the food comes out was AMAZING! Blue cheese on top while dipping it into the olive oil was to die for. We also ate the jalapeno cheese grits and lobster Mac. Both were really good. And of course we drank, and the tequila cider was so tasty. Our server was fast and knowledgeable.",

I ordered the steak medium rare with no sides. Oh man the steak was phenomenal. I enjoyed every single bite as it was cooked to perfection. I've never had a Delmonico steak... But this was just amazing. One of the best steaks I've had in my life. One steak was enough to fill me. (5/5)  The second night I ordered the 18oz dry age rib eye. The rib eye was good, but it wasn't as good as the Delmonico. I'm not sure why the Delmonico was better... Especially because they are both the same cut. The rib eye was a 4/5  The third night, I went back and ordered the Delmonico again as I loved it that much. Again, it tasted phenomenal!  The ambiance was great, the music was nice, the decor was classy but hip. Nice place to go if you can afford it!",

I also ordered the lobster Mac n cheese. Maybe I'm s mac n cheese snob but feel they missed the mark with this dish. Noodles were cut into small little bits I could barely pick up with a fork. Lots of lobster but just wasn't up to par with others I've had. Over all, STK exceeded my expectations and Isaac was amazing. Will definitely be back.",

It had a tough tendon running the length of it that I couldnt cut with the dull steak knife I was given. Didnt care for it at all. The broccolini was bitter, didnt care for it. My gf liked her cream corn and truffle fries.   People saying this is the best steak in Vegas are lying. Fix at Bellagio and Gallagher's at NYNY will both serve you a way better steak than STK.

Aside from the phenomenal food with flavors that explode in your mouth I was really diggin the 90's throw back tunes that had us all dancing over dinner. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. I would also like to note that everyone who worked there did an incredible job getting everything out quickly and making sure we always had drinks and whatever else we needed...they were also extremely patient with our table who maybe got a little too excited after drinks and throw back tunes.   Not a fan of the bathrooms. I needed to fix my lipstick after dinner and the mirror is in front of everyone (men and women) waiting in line so they just kind of awkwardly stare at you. Ha!",

    "text": "I hate to knock off a star but hopefully the STK folks will read this review and fix things.  I'm staying at The Aria, my wife the entire day is saying it's not too late to change the reservation to Jean George...  No! The reason I chose STK is the club vibe. I want to have a Vegas fun feeling, sipping cocktails while nom'ing on a Porterhouse for two. I can get Jean George back in NYC, let's rock it tonite!  We walk in, I see the DJ booth. The DJ, she's rockin' the vibe. It's dark and sultry. We order our drinks. My wife orders a beet salad split for us both (I wanted the Caesar) many different kinds of beets. STK sexy beets. Oh baby.  Porterhouse for two is ordered along with Brussel Sprouts mixed with the best bacon in the world, Nueske bacon. STK sexy bacon. Yukon Gold mashed potatoes as well. I forgot we're in a hotel and can't bring it back to the house. STK sexy mistake.  Now here's where things snap me out of the vibe: *$16* for steak sauces?! I know it's dark and I'm buzzed. Are you folks high with those prices? I figured, the natural juices will be enough and I'll keep my $16 bucks. It needed sauce.... there were no extra juices from the meat  *One* bathroom?! In a club? Those Brussel Sprouts left me gassy, I had to let one rip in the worst way. I had to wait on a line.... uncool  This is also a club, there's no dress code or security?? I'm from New York visiting the hottest hotel on the strip. My wife is wearing a smokin' dress and I have a suit on. I see a schmuck in shorts and flip flops?? I wanted to tackle him while security tossed him out. There's an STK Orlando, I'm sure some tourist will walk in wearing a Mickey tee shirt, it's kind of expected. I bet STK NYC doesn't put up with this BS. Hey, I spent over $250 on dinner, have a damn dress code.  It would have been nice to bring home leftovers but we're on vacation. I ordered too much food, I could of left off the mashed potatoes. Our waiter was awesome, he knew it was our anniversary and sent over a small dessert we shared.   Beef up security, have a damn dress code and this place would be 5 stars",

    "text": "1. Walked in at 5:25 for 5:30 reservation and were told to wait outside until they opened their doors (they were unlocked but apparently they needed to be opened to enter the restaurant). Not able to sit at their bar 5 minutes before the reservation so went to another restaurant across the way to get a cocktail.  2. Came back at 5:40 and the restaurant was basically empty, however we were told to go wait at the bar until our table was ready. Thinking this was ridiculous, we did not order drinks. We just wanted our table and to see their wine list. We watched other parties walk in and think exactly the same thing. 'Why are we waiting when this restaurant is empty and we have a reservation?' There were like 4-5 hostess so it wasn't like 2 girls were overwhelmed.   3. When we finally got a table we were sat next to THE ONLY two other parties of two in the restaurant. We were one foot apart from each table. There were 15+ other tables for two available in that section.  They continued to seat people right next to the last all through night as opposed to staggering guests for more privacy. Most people asked to be moved and many just said they would sit in the bar, confused. We eventually made conversation with the other two tables beside us because it felt like we were eating with them. It would not have felt like this if the restaurant was packed, it was the fact that it was so empty and we were squished together for no reason.   Overall:  This first 20 minutes at the restaurant made us so surprised, it was difficult to get over. We discussed getting up and going back to the oyster restaurant where we got our drinks, assuming this experience could only get worse. We spent $300 and were treated like we were eating at an Applebee's. The food wasn't bad but I would never recommend to a client or friend.   Get new hostesses who know how to properly treat and seat your customers. It really isn't that hard.",

    "text": "The world consists out of two types of people: those who do believe it is worth paying decent money for a good steak and those who don't. STK manages to cater to both.  I certainly belong to the first category, I love a good steak and I try to include a high-end steakhouse whenever I visit Vegas. After a friend's recommendation and as we were staying in the Cosmopolitan anyways, we booked STK for 9 of us during our latest Vegas trip. My 14 oz dry-aged Delmonico was perfect, the taste was sublime and it was seared just like I requested. Although the waitress recommended one side per person, we went for 5 sides for 9 people. All of them were very good, especially the truffle risotto and the asparagus were big hits.  Some of my friends are not as big of a meat lover as I am and ordered a non-steak entree. I would call you crazy if you ordered something else in a steakhouse but all the dishes looked really good, even the fish dish (Dover Sole) looked great and my friends seemed to enjoy it. So kudos for STK to also please people who are less fond of steak.  All of us, both steak lovers and non-steak lovers agreed that it was one of the better or even the best steakhouse experience in Vegas!",

When you call around dinner time to make a reservation the same day most likely there are no more table, or after 10 pm which is way past my dinner time.   we had a bottle of veuve cliquot which was perfect with our appetizers tartar, and sea food platter (king crap legs, shrimp, crab salad, and oysters) the oysters r omg so small, they're like miniatures but they are absolutely flavorful and fresh. Also my friend keep on telling me their special house bread (blue cheese bread) was amazing with their olive dressing. I couldn't eat cheese so sorry couldn't give you my opinion, but I did tried the olive oil dressing that came with it wasn't bad at all.  I had 7 oz skirt stake medium rare with truffle butter on the side which I took more than half to-go, I know 7 oz is really small, but I think it was all the appetizer, champagne, filled me up. Truffle butter was good, I never had any type of butter with steak, in my mind I saw \"truffle\" I just assume it was black truffle tapenade (maybe they do have off the menu in the kitchen somewhere) if that's the case.. you must have the black truffle topped on your steak. I tried my friend's filet mignon medium well it was perfectly done. I'm not very into red meat, but once a while it can be amazing especially when its done right like STK. It'll be perfect to pair with a glass of shiraz, but champagne was enough, I still need to able to walk in heels without wobbling and be able to fit in my tight clothing so that was that, no more drinking for me!!!....   I rarely give 5 stars, but I had to because I had an amazing time & great company with me. It was laughter, happiness, and amazing dinner.",

I'll start with the worst parts and then the few good parts.  My second time here I ordered a Bone-in Rib eye medium rare.  It came back a tad on the rare side (in the middle), which I don't really mind.  But the main issue was an extreme amount of gristle.  I'm normally able to down even the tough parts of steaks.  Every single bite had something I could not get down.  Halfway through my steak, I gave up.  I did not complain or return my steak because I don't want to be that guy.  Instead I'll just learn my lesson and stop coming here.  2/4 of us had inedible steaks and the other 2 did have quite a bit of gristle, but not as bad.  My first time I ordered a filet mignon medium rare.  It came medium well and that is a no-go for me.  The good:  The buratta salad was delicious.  Obviously the heirloom tomatoes have amazing flavor and go well with the cheese.  I've had a few other appetizers and they were also very good.  So don't go here for a steak.

Later as I waited for the restroom the attendant allowed a female customer into the male restroom because the female one was busy. When she finished I tried to use it also and he stopped me and said I could no longer use it since there were male customers waiting. Ladies first doesn't apply, even for a 5 month pregnant lady.

The only complaint was the provided menus to choose from (pre fixed with groups over 15) were quite poor and only included one main beef choice for the most part. I ended up adding a second beef cut for a fee per person, regardless of if they actually ordered the second option. The sides were fantastic. Great service. Good ambiance, however, we were seated at the high tops for a large party (19) and it was a bit difficult to converse- as expected. Pricing was high but we had a great experience and all left completely stuffed. You get what you pay for and this meal was fantastic. Table was ready within 5 minutes which I appreciated on a busy Saturday night. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

My wife and I both ordered the filet mignon while the steak itself was great both of our plates were served with a different sauce on each plate. I ordered the side of Parmesan truffle fries and my wife the mashed potatoes. I was not a fan of the flavor of the fries themselves and the mashed potatoes tasted like instant mashed potatoes from the microwave and were completely unseasoned. During our dinner our waitress rarely checked on us and when she did she seemed less than happy to be there which seemed to be a trend among many of the servers there. The decor of the restaurant was high end and looked great however is not enough to offset the poor service and lack of good side dishes. For a bill totaling $169 for two people the food quality should be much greater.",

When you first enter, it felt like a mini club lounge. It's a very trendy restaurant that's dimly lit. There is an in house DJ and it gets pretty loud in the restaurant. So if you're thinking first date, maybe not. Ordered the cowboy rib steak 34 oz. mash potatoes and mac and cheese and the doughnuts. The sides can be shared as it is enough for two. My friends ordered a bunch of sides and we all shared. So the items that stood out for me were the complimentary bread, the truffle fries and jalapeno grits. The cowboy rib steak was not good. The steak lacked in flavor and it didn't wow me. I was pretty sad about that because I was hoping for an amazing juicy buttery dish. Honestly, the sides and that bread was amazing. So the doughnuts aren't consistent. We ordered two orders of the doughnuts. One was super oily and one was amazing! Overall, I didn't think STK lived up to to all of their hype.",

Service was great he explained the menu and made great suggestions I think his name was Eddie?   I started with the hamachi, it was fresh and melted in your mouth.   The bread was to die for steaming hot and fresh out of the oven.   Entree I got the filet medallion, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and I had the mushroom pot pie!! Amazing.   The only thing that i didn't like was the two tops tables where we were sitting it was too close to the other tables so it didn't feel Intimate as if the other party could hear on our conversation.   And it gets super busy so walking out was a struggle as everyone crowds the bar and here is no easy walkway.  I will return",

The ribeye was prepared well, but the meat had a ton of connective tissue and a good part of it was inedible.

Servers were very helpful and knowledgeable. Food howveer was subpar, to my expectations at least for this price range. For apps, we ordered two different tartares, a few salads, and a crab tortellini.  The avocados were a little overwhelming, covering over most of the taste. The crab was okay, but it seemed a little dry. Good combo with the sauce though. For the entree, a few of us got the special, a 16 oz ribeye. Imo, it seemed a little small, and wasnt exactly cooked to what we ordered (medium rare for most). You would expect them to get that right..granted,  they were quick to recook a different piece, which we appreciated. I've definitely had better steak, but this was a great place nonetheless. Sadly, hard to take pictures in these dimly lighted place.. :/",

    "text": "Went here for a corporate dinner. They sat 12 of us at a table for 10. Crammed in like sardines!  Loud deep bass music, not conducive for conversations.    Appetizers were good. Then the steaks came. As my steak arrived last, the waiter asked, medium?  I replied no, medium rare.  I then watch him walk around the restaurant with my steak, and return saying medium rare.  Of course what came back was an over cooked piece of crap.  The problem was that I was sitting with my entire Executive Management Team, and I would not be that guy that calls the waiter/restaurant out. So 3 bites later, I sent the plate back and was done.    There must be 50 great steak places in Las Vegas, think Prime or Capital Grill, but don't think STK!",

    "text": "Updating my previous review posted on September/2014. I had given it 5 stars then and will give this restaurant 5 stars now. This restaurant and its menu is world class. Once in a while, one may run into service hiccups which normally happen between 9PM and 11PM. This is the restaurant's busiest time with every seat occupied and every server to go along with it all. We started with an appetizer of Alaskan Crab Legs. You only get two however they come glazed with garlic butter sauce and I had ordered them warm and not chilled. Huge hit with the Pinot Noir that we were paring these with. I had the delicious 14oz bone-in Filet Mignon along with the 1 1/4 lb lobster tail to make it a Surf n Turf. The steak and lobster tail was prepared to my liking and was complimented well with a side dish of Truffle Fries. If you haven't tried their Truffle Fries then please do so since it beats the standard potato sides in my opinion. I think that the sprinkled parmesan cheese combined with thick slices of potato arranged perfectly on a plate makes this a good side to have. The filet was as soft was butter and tasted amazing with very little spicing. I had declined additional sauces or garnishment for the steak as well.  This restaurant can only have one challenge and that is service and that too because it will always be compared with the world class food and ambiance. It appears that the only thing that may slip here is service.",

There was a DJ playing a great set and it was classy and lively at the same time.  Service was quick and friendly.  I ordered the 20oz and it was cooked perfect with some horseradish on the side.  We ordered Mac and cheese, fries, and sauteed mushrooms (not on menu) as a sides.    Con't be surprised with whatever amount comes out on the check, you're eating at a high end steak house and hopefully having a couple drinks as well.  I definitely recommend for a nicer dinner in Vegas.",

Everyone was professional and knowledgeable especially our server! Wish I remembered his name. I had already eaten a few hours before so I was really full but I enjoyed some of their famous bread rolls and creamed corn app. Creamed corn is my absolute favorite and this hit the spot! I shared some steak with my friends and it was cooked to perfection. The alcohol wasn't watered down and just a few drinks will give you the right buzz. The STK establishment of course is really pricey but if you want to treat yourself you won't regret it. Make reservations because upon walking out by only 8 pm on a Thursday night there was a huge line out the door. Turn time could be as long as 3 hours so don't come on a time crunch.",

    "text": "What an outstanding brunch at STK.  I came during restaurant week so the menu came priced at $30 with options from starter, entree, and dessert sections.  The choices were kale salad and salmon bites to start, brunch club sandwich, pancakes, and prime rib hash for entrees, and cookies and milk or donuts for dessert.  We decided to try as much as possible so we each ordered differently, excluding the pancakes.  We began with a complimentary champagne and the bread basket that came with an icing dipping sauce.  Unique bread offering, especially giving it a dessert feel to begin and end the meal.  The portions are enormous at every stage of the morning.  The kale salad was easily a meal on its own and as good as it gets.  The smoked salmon crackers with cream cheese had a full fish with the amount of lox they plated.  And these were just the starters.  The club sandwich came with plantain-like sweet potato fries and four double decker cuts.  The avocado was a great addition to this dish.  The prime rib hash came with a couple of poached eggs and some hash browns underneath with a nice sauce.  Out of those two, I would recommend the hash, especially since STK is still the Cosmo go to steak house, brunch or not.  But both are great options and enough to take home for a meal later in the day for sure.  The dessert - just plain ridiculous.  The donuts come 6 to a plate and are just well made, fresh offerings.  The milk and cookies (get this dessert!) comes with a medium sized vanilla milkshake (one of the best I've ever tasted), and 10 cookies.  Ours included gingerbread, chocolate chip, and powdered.  I believe it is based on chef's choice though.  Their dessert game is spot on from the opening bread to the ending platter.  I usually don't order dessert at restaurants, but I am really glad I came during restaurant week to experience this treat.  The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very clubby with an active DJ during the 11am-2pm brunch time.  It didn't seem like a too crowded restaurant for brunch (maybe Eggslut's opening was taking some buzz) but it really should be.  I will most definitely be back to try other brunch offerings or for dinner to stuff my face once again.  It's not your typical high end, classy joint ambiance-wise (prices are on par, however), but still a fantastic meal.  Portions unbelievable and definitely a sweeter alternative for brunch in town.",

My wife had the filet, while I had the strip. We ordered the jalapeno grits and the macaroni and cheese as sides, and both ordered a few drinks. My steak came out medium though I ordered medium rare, but it was still good. The Mac and the grits killed the game though. I'm from GA, so I judge Mac and cheese and grits very harshly....These were some of the best I've ever put on a spoon. The only thing better than the food was the service. Our waiter was knowledgeable, prompt, and personable. He asked us if we had a show or plans to get to after which we did (Zumanity). I really wish I could remember his name, but that's what happens when you write reviews days later.   With some drinks Dinner can get expensive, but it's Vegas and this place won't disappoint.",

We went to dinner on Sunday and drinks on Tuesday and it was extremely busy both times with well dressed, attractive people.   The food is very good with consistent quality to other STK restaurants. Our table ordered a seafood platter which was delicious and very fresh and everyone ordered a steak for the main meal. I had the 10oz filet cooked medium rare, which was perfectly cooked. A number of people at our table ordered truffle butter on their steak, which was recommended by the waitress. They said it was amazing. We also ordered creamed spinach, asparagus, Mac and cheese, and the corn side dishes which were all very well done.   The cocktails are good, and slightly unique takes on classics. The wine selection is also quite good; I really enjoyed the rose champagne as a pre-dinner drink.   The food is good, but expensive. Although when going to high end restaurants in Vegas, it is to be expected. I think this restaurant has the best vibe in all the restaurants at the Cosmo hotel.   The restaurant only has 2 bathrooms - one for men and one for women. Could definitely benefit from another one as there is often a line.",

I picked STK cause it it was one of the best steakhouses recommended on Yelp. I like the photos everyone!!! The steakhouse had a dark setting and a bit of light shining down at the center of the table. The music is pretty loud and I do feel a bit claustrophobic. The setting is tight.  For starters we had Hudson Foie Gras and Oysters on a Half Shell. The foie gras was well grilled. Really creaming and buttery taste. The Oysters were small. I don't think my husband felt anything. The lamb and flank steak was really tender and juicy. We really enjoyed it with the side dishes. The dessert presentation is a work of art. The S'mores and cheese cake were delicious. The marshmallow was a bit sweet for me. I was impressed with the management at the restaurant. When the table next to me had left, the stuff would clean the table and whip the chair. Just 2 mins later I saw a gentleman came over and used the flashlight on his phone to check the table and chairs to make sure they did not miss a spot! There were some small pieces of food on the set and he had them clean it right away. That was great to see their management was on top of things.",

The music was pulsing and the vibe was good. The DJ played quite a few tunes from the early 2000's - which was fine with me since I'm in my thirties and it brought back fond memories of when I wild and mortgage-free. The servers were friendly but were a bit difficult to get ahold of for drink refills.  Hubs had the beef short rib, which was good. I started with the Steak Tartare with black truffle, sliced radish and soy caramel, which was fantastic. It definitely put the tartare at Comme Ca to shame in a big way. For my entree, I had the seared big eye tuna with wasabi potato, maitake and sweet miso jus. The ahi was great and full of flavor. I was hoping for a bit more potato to  soak up all of the wine; however, my dish only came with about 2 small tablespoons of it. Luckily hubs and I ordered a side of mac and cheese to supplement our starches. However, the mac and cheese was just ok. It was bland. I'll be honest, Kraft mac and cheese from a box tastes better. I wish they had the option to add truffle oil to it...that would've done the trick. The portions were small but the food is so rich, we probably couldn't eat any more than we got.  Near the end of our meal, we remembered that we never got any bread so we asked for it. It was warm, fresh and came with this delicious pesto-like dipping sauce. Wish we got it at the beginning of our meal, but unlike other restaurants, again you have to ask for it.   In any event, we left the restaurant full and happy. We would definitely return.  Expect to spend about $100 per person.",

It's because they offer and serve smaller cuts so that women would be more inclined to eat a steak. They still had larger cuts and the usual hearty sides. The Kobe sliders were amazing though very pricey but worth every dollar. I say this is the closes thing to a meat-meat market I have ever seen and I have to say I enjoyed it all night.",

First off, skip everything on the menu and go straight for the steak, the biggest one you can find!  Holy cow, fan f*cking tastic, excuse my french but my steak literally melted in my mouth.  Be sure to dress up cause everyone is on their A game.  If people watching is your scene, this is the ultimate!  You never know what you will get.  We ended up dining next to Kobe Bryant and let me just tell you, watching the scantly clad groupies attack was quite the show.  They have a DJ so it tends to be very loud so I would not recommend coming here for an intimate meal.",

It's a fantastic steak, but no better than a Flemming's or a Ruths Cris.  On the other hand the bread, the mushroom pot pie, and the service were all pretty impressive. Our waiter was phenomenal. He was extremely attentive, completely knowledgeable of all the food items and wines, honest and candid about his opinions, and darn amusing. He made the 4th star.  Would I go back?

    "text": "Listen..Let me just start by saying that i have NEVER in my life been treated with such disrespect from a \"classy\" restaurant\". I have heard such wonderful things about STK and I figured I'd give it a try to see what's all the talk was about. Long story short I had a cousin visiting me from Wisconsin and he was here to celebrate his 21st birthday! While booking my reservation I made sure it was known that the reason for dining that night was to celebrate. Now normally at these types of places, they give you some sort of small cake and ice cream etc and wish the person a happy birthday. Upon arriving I even reminded the hostess about the birthday, she replied \"yeah ok\" with a smug face. That's the first point off. What's with the attitude? Next when it was time to order food we had a waiter come over who from the get go was STANK. For a person who's never ate at this place I expected some sort of recommendations or just to at least be more friendly. He was unbelievable! One person in my party never really ate steak and he wanted to just get a small appetizer and a side of crab. Well guess what when this crab came out it was on a little petri dish with maybe an OUNCE of crab?  $25??? GTFOH! So when i told the waiter about the size and let him know that it wasnt exactly what I expected he got an attitude and snatched the plate, and at that moment I had to stop myself from snatching HIM! unbelievable! After that situation occured he never returned to the table which was fine because it would have been a situation if he came back with that attitude! Now on to the food.. The food was a different story! I ordered the Bone-In Ribeye steak(medium well) AMAZING! My Cousin ordered the Skirt Steak(Well Done) AMAZING! Another person ordered the Filet(medium). So as you can see the food wasn't the issue it was the service and in a place like this that wants to charge the prices they do, they need to make sure they have respectable people working for them and learn how to not judge people. Nobody in my group was not dressed for the occasion but because you see a group of black guys you off the bat treat us like we aren't suppose to be there? I make PLENTY (legit) MONEY $$$ and eat 5-star meals on the regualr, so fine dining is NEVER an issue. My RED BOTTOM Christian Louboutin loafers cost more than the hostess and waiter's paycheck COMBINED! So.. With all that being said I would NEVER return back to this place even if somebody paid me.. Know That!",

    "text": "Cliff's Notes version: The worst service we have ever had in our lives. Some of the best meat we've ever had in our lives. Calculate the risk in going here.  Just as other reviewers said, cool vibe (DJ = good but loud), had to wait 30 mins after our reservation at 10:15 to get seated and came within moments of losing our table service at the club we were going to after. We, unlike other reviewers, were given no special treatment. We, too, were a bachelorette party.  In fact, we had the oddest, worst service any of us have ever had. There were 10 of us, all living/ having lived in the 3 major cities (NYC, Chicago, and LA) and it was literally the worst any of us have had, to the extent where several people wondered if our waiter was high on something. He was rude to the point of disbelief. At first we thought he was being snarky/funny, then we thought perhaps it was a shtick like at Ed Debevic's, but no, we realized as the night went on, it was just horrible.  I want to be crystal clear - we were not your typical bachelorette party. We were a more mature group, and there were no boas/ genitalia accessories/ strippers whatsoever. Just looking to enjoy a good meal before going out for the evening. We all ordered quickly and did not ask for substitutions. Sincerely, we were an easy group.   I also want to be clear that all of us are by no means strangers to having to wait to be seated/ put up with service issues in the \"hot spot\" du jour.   Among the complaints/ comments he made to us were: - I GUESS I can go ahead and bring you a drink menu (after a friend asked for one, and he suggested a signature cocktail and she said it sounded a little sweet for her) - as if he shouldn't have brought one to begin with just in general, much less at 10:15 on a Saturday and to a group of 10 people who were also celebrating a bachelorette - Do you even know what you just ordered? (when a friend ordered a glass of wine) - Nobody's ordering ANYTHING (when a friend ordered a salad first, and he asked whether he should bring it out first, and she asked whether others were getting starters) - Other outwardly aggressive stuff, like when two friends said they were splitting one of the larger steaks  He also pushed doing bottle service immediately without even asking if we were interested, and kept trying to push us to order more. Again, we all had tabs of about $60+, on which he automatically got 20%. Sorry that we don't want to each get 20 oz. filets before heading out for the night in tight Las Vegas club apparel??? Looking back, perhaps the guaranteed gratuity meant there was no incentive for good service.  The food was delicious. We had several veggies, all fresh but nothing spectacular; the macaroni which is highly touted and good, but again not the best I've had; steaks which even the most elite foodies in our group said were the best they've had, and the waygu sliders which were mind-blowing. No one got the signature cocktails, as they were all coated in candy and $18 apiece, which is absurd for a non-artisinal bar cocktail. I've had drinks at Grant Achatz's Aviary for less than that.  We left without complaining as we had to physically rush to make sure the rest of our night's plans weren't messed up.  Would go back as the food definitely warranted a second shot, but I'd be weary.",

    "text": "Soo this place was just ok for me. Kind of silly the fuss they made about being so busy they only take reservations, no walk ins...well we walked in 30 mins late for our \"well try to squeeze you in \" reservation and the place was pretty dead. So we obviously got in no problem. Nice vibe, loud club type music, which we enjoyed. Had 2 shots of patron to get our night off to a good start;) $36. Our waiter was crazy funny, and all the staff were really nice and friendly. And everyone looks like a model here, including the bus boys! Dress code is definitely enforced here. It's pretty snazzy. So my husband ordered the seared tuna which the waiter said was very spicy so my husband jumped on it. I ordered the filet and mashed potatoes. They sent us bread and an interesting dipping sauce that reminded me of a wheatgrass shot. No bueno. So our food arrived I was excited, the steak was good. Not amazing which I expected for a 6oz. $40 steak from a place known for steak. My husband, a True spicy freak was sad his food wasn't spicy at all. So he asked the waiter for hot sauce which got us a really dirty look. Apparently we offended him. Mashed potatoes were ok. I ordered another $16 drink and we were ready to go. Got our check, put our cash down with at least $50 due in change and I guess the waiter expected that as his tip? Once again when we asked for our change we got the glare and some sarcastic remark. Needless to say, don't be rude to your customers...he definitely didn't get the $50 tip he was hoping for. Probably will spend our $150 on another place next time.",

Not to mention, I have worked in MANY different restaurants and bars and have NEVER seen an issue like this where they wouldn't split the bill.   Due to tax and inclusive gratuity that was hard to estimate per person, we ended up short over $200, that someone had to foot the bill for.

When they said \"not your daddy's steak house\", what they should have said is we got rid of all the good stuff from your daddy's steak house and kept all the bad.  Yes it has a sexy vibe, after all the hostess staff and female bar staff will remind you of Coyote Ugly, you have club music playing at club decibels and its dark.  What this means to you, is bartenders with attitude, hostesses that only pay attention to the men in your group and an envirnoment so loud you can't hold a conversation.  The saving grace was our server and the food.  Our server was top notch and very personable, the food was good, but not good enough to put myself through that experience again.  The manager could care less about his hostesses behavior, there were no apologies just excuses and he even lied to us.  If you have to entertain your in-laws and you HATE holding a conversation with them, then this is the place to be.  You can easily ignore them through the meal because you can honestly tell them you can't hear a word they are saying and eat in peace (as long as you can ignore the hear shattering music).  Also bring your ones with you when you use the bathroom and when I say bathroom I mean as in ONE AND ONLY ONE stall per ladies and one for men.  Get ready to wait in line or you have to leave the restaurant to use one.  If you STILL want to come to STK make sure you have the truffle mac n cheese.",

He wasn't rude but just very very busy and with the loud music playing it made it even harder. I really enjoyed their choice of music but it was just too loud for restaurant. Especially a resturant where the waiters don't really go above and beyond to make sure you're party is ok.   The food was actually pretty good not the best but pretty good. Our bill was about $600 but for that price I really wish the waiters and servers would've went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves and had everything we needed.   Oh! Also, they charged us $25 for the birthday sparkler and a slice of cake I assumed it was free but it definatly showed up... I wish we knew ahead of time. Might of skipped it.",

Torn between the risotto or king crab we went with the king crab legs .. We requested it to be steamed w/ melted butter .. Portion was so so,  but the intense fishiness we tasted from one of the legs was no good .. I asked prior as to how fresh their seafood  was and was told that it was flown in daily fresh ..   My wife received the worst of it as the crab leg left her  nauseated  and unable to finish the rest her meal ..  The service was impeccable .. They were very attentive and replaced the appetizer with a short rib ravioli that was excellent ..   I decided to go large and order the Delmonico steak ..  It was cooked medium rare as requested and the lobster topping was excellent no fishiness and fresh ..  What I was surprised was that a good portion of my steak was inedible as it was too tough to cut and very fatty.   They did not charge us for the ravioli do to the crab legs issue and were nice enough to provide us each w/ bday desserts but my wife's nausea was overwhelming leaving her unable to finish her glass of champagne and crippled her for the evening ..   An unfortunate event .. All n all STK WAS $O $O expensive for the standard of quality food we received.

We had a reservation for 930 - we show up and are told they are running 20 minutes behind. We inquire what the point of having a reservation is and the hostess just stares blankly back at us. I ask her how we will know when our table is ready and she says\"someone will come find you.\" Mind you, there are so many people congregated by the doorway that I don't think she could find us if she had to. We wait for 30 minutes and watch people come out and watch them head back in. No one appears to actually be leaving.   I head back in and ask her how much longer and she says \"I really don't know - we are waiting for the tables to clear out.\" I push for an estimate of time and she says \"I would guess 20-30 minutes.\" This means on top of my reservation I might have to wait an additional hour!! No thanks.   If you are looking for a nice dining experience look else where - this place is all about being cool. When I'm hungry I don't care about cool - I want to eat!!   Long story short - we left after 30 min (on top of our reservation) I am not giving hundreds of dollars to a place that doesn't value every customer. No food is worth that. We travel quite a bit and have been to many restaurants and this one took the cake (in a bad way) in the Customer service department.   Would we attempt to come back again (perhaps at a less busy time?!) - NO WAY!!",

The cost was more for the size than the quality.  i would opt to get something smaller and more delicious.  Porter house:  Decent, would get it again.  Wagyu:  so-so for this grade meat, try something else.  Bone-in Filet: Winner of the bunch.  Bone-in Ribeye:  Good, but for the first time i thought the filet tasted better than the ribeye.  We actually had a 3.5 hour dinner, because our steaks didn't come out for 2 hours after we ordered.  I'm not kidding....   Manager gave us a free bottle of wine as an apology.  Besides the ridiculous wait for our entrees the service was good.  However in the end, everyone agreed Del Frisco's was more impressive.",

    "text": "So I have been to the STK in LA, thus I knew what to expect in terms of atmosphere. I still laugh when I read review by people complaining about loud music - this is not Denny's folks!  The music is actually not too loud, but perhaps louder then what's typical.  Anyway, I love the vibe of this place. It's trendy, fun, and happens to have great food.   Speaking of food...  Wedge salad:  It's good, but nothing too unique about it. Smaller than most wedge salads out there although we shared it. I might try a different salad next time.   Ahi tuna tartare:  Very good flavor and presentation. Just wish they gave you more of those fancy chips on top. I would order this again.   Steak:  We had the medium filet and bone in filet. Both were high quality and cooked to perfection. On par with most high end steakhouses in terms of quality and price. I would order the bone in filet again.   Cream of spinach: Not sure if it was a bad batch, but there was not enough cream. I would not order this again.   Mac and cheese:  It's a good Mac and cheese with four cheeses. However, it needed bacon or something to make it more unique. I would try a different side next time.   Chocolate chip cookie in a skillet with vanilla ice cream:  Yummy!  It was good as expected and is always my go to desert.   Service: excellent. Our server was very on top of everything and made good suggestions.   The only con is the seating for couples is to basically jam everyone as close as possible to maximize seating. It didn't bother me too much, but I like a little more room for a $300-400 dinner.",

Here are my recommendations:  Likes:  Steak: Bone-In Rib and Fliet with Truffle Butter  Corn Pudding: sweet and yummy!  Dislikes:  Foie Gras Butter: tasted like regular butter - no foie gras taste whatsoever  Brocollini: $9 for blah brocollini? No thanks!  STK Bold Sauce: GROSS!

We had a terrific experience.  We preordered a birthday cake, which was seamless.  We had a 7 pm res on a Saturday and got seated after about fifteen minutes....just time enough to get a round of cocktails.   Much of the seating is semi circular booths, which works very well, allowing privacy and the ability to look at the other patrons.  The music was loud but never too loud.   We had a really great server, Jeremy.  He was terrific and really looked after us.  The food very very good.  Foie and waffles, excellent.  Steaks and dipping sauces, terrific.  Oysters were excellent.  Salads also very good as well as the creamed corn.  And the bread service was really really good.   Highly recommended, and ask for Jeremy !",

    "text": "For a fancy dining experience/steak house, particularly one in a nice hotel like the Cosmo, I would have expected better. My buddies and I came here because I had $500 dining credits (you know, being the big casino donators we are), and was left feeling less than satisfied on many fronts.  First, the place was loud and dark, and frankly, pretentious.  Secondly, the food took quite some time to come out and when it did, let's just say I've had better Rib Eye at most other steak houses I've been to.  Really nothing much to rave about here. What really got me upset was the service and how they screwed that up royally.  Since the meal was covered with casino dining credits, I tipped out of my own pocket.  $100 for a $500 meal seems reasonable.. until I realized I was charged $200.  When I called the STK to correct this and provided my receipt as proof, apparently I was told this error in credit card billing has happened before and they can't do much about it.  After a few days of dealing with the manager who's quite hard to get a hold of, I finally just said screw it and left it with my credit card to deal with.  With many other steak houses available on the strip, I don't anticipate coming back here anytime soon.",

We had no reservations but managed to get a 4 top at the bar since we had friends joining us.  Tables were close together but everyone around us was having a great time.  The DJ that night was spinning all my favorite tunes and then some!  that set the tone for being in Vegas!   Not a place for a quiet romantic evening..., your in Vegas for crying out loud in the Cosmo!!!  The bread they serve is awesome, best bread I have had in a while!  food, drinks, service and atmoshpere was the best!  Next time we are in town, this place is the first stop for dinner!! Think we will even stay at Cosmo next time.",

    "text": "Came here for a work dinner while at a conference in Vegas - we had a private room... which was very small and had black padded walls... We were told that the room could only accommodate 16 guests (which was the size of our party)... they probably should have scaled the maximum down to 12 - we literally were sitting elbow to elbow, with a couple people actually sitting at the corners of the rectangular table.  Service was very attentive while we were in the room, and we were able to adjust the volume of the music (which was good, as in the regular dining room the music was on the level of techno club blaring), as well as the temperature.  On the whole, the food was very good.  We started with several trays of cold seafood - jumbo prawns, chilled lobster, and raw oysters.  Everything was very very fresh.  I had the king crab salad with with melon, mache, and i believe some grapefruit.  It was beautifully presented, but in terms of taste, just okay -  strangely a little on the salty side with not much actual crab flavor.  I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter, cooked a perfect medium rare.  We all ordered different sides, and so I got to try a whole variety of them - some of my favorites were the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with lobster, mushroom pot pie, and the garlic truffle fries.  We went through several bottles of good wine (I sampled some chardonnays and a couple cabs), and I ended the meal with an incredibly flavorful mango sorbet, which was the perfect finish to such a large meal.  Overall, I would give STK a 3.5 rating -- the food is very good for the most part, although it is definitely on the pricier side.  The service is attentive as well, however the ambiance of the restaurant overall is a little strange (although I guess it IS Vegas).  I would recommend for a party of 8-10 (to snag a private room, but have enough room to eat without having to sit on top of your neighbor) - I can't imagine being able to have any sort of conversation out in the regular dining room since the music was blaring so loud.",

Maybe I am just getting old, but when I am eating dinner, I would prefer not to have music blaring in my ears, to the point, where we had to try and shout over it to speak.  OK.  Yes, I am getting old!  The food was just OK.  I think they may have been having an off night, because my whole party seemed to have the same opinion of the food, which is very different from the glowing reviews I heard from friends.  Our server was good, not great, but really can't complain too much about him.  I will try it again on another trip to Vegas,m but first impression was not great.",

The fois gras was superb, leaving you wanting for more. My bone-in fillet was aged sufficiently and prepared exactly to temperature, with a delicate crust. The sides were excellent, especially the Brussel sprouts which were baked with tiny cubes of smoked bacon... wow. Service was good and not pushy, and there were plenty of beautiful people to look at all night. The half moon booth seating creates more of a clubish feel, but may leave some diners uncomfortable if sitting in the middle or on the straight edge. But the booths are large so there's plenty of elbow room. I've enjoyed other steakhouses more but I give this one 5-stars because the setting and atmosphere makes for a distinct steakhouse experience.",

When I protested, I was given a table with a waiter who was none to thrilled to have a solo, non-drinking diner. He was very curt and appeared to not have the time of day for me. Having read reviews on yelp, I knew the bread was a must have. Holy Moly! The bread was divine and really made the meal memorable. In fact, I am still thinking of that bread a week later. The  creamed corn was also delicious and a thousand times more appetizing than my overcooked filet mignon with a runny bearnaise sauce. After ordering, I never saw the waiter again but you could tell he clearly wanted me out of there because I was offered the check before I was even asked if I wanted coffee and dessert, which of course, I did. The dessert, a peanut butter s'more would have been much more delicious if served warm/hot and it did not leave me wanting s'more.  Would I recommend STK to a friend? Only if they were allowed to order just bread and creamed corn.",

The waiter was fantastic and attentive and gave us ample time to look over the menu and just relax a little instead of trying to push us through our meal.  We both ordered salads that were large and fantastic.  Our entree's were both bone in rib eye steaks cooked perfectly the way we ordered them.  One of the two side dishes was great which was the yukon potatoes that tasted like you were eating warm butter they were so creamy.  The second appetizer was mac and cheese that was baked with a generous amount of cheese on top, except for the fact that they were made with tiny noodles that resembled more like something you would give to a child which I asked if they were meant for a 5 year old.  The combination of tiny pasta and a large amount of cheese made it soupy and not worthy of the $10 they charged for it.  STK, get rid of the mac and cheese or make it so an adult would enjoy it.  The sideshow of the obliterated drunk girl across from us was priceless though, with all of the nose picking and messy mashed potato eating she couldn't make into her mouth with consistency made the night for us though.",

I ate at the upper-level bar, and despite it being a very busy Friday night, I received excellent service from the delightfully-chatty bartender who probably burned 500 calories an hour hustling behind the bar.  I actually enjoyed the loud 1980s music; they played about 4 of my favorite songs in a row.

Let me tell you, it was probably the strangest dinner I have ever been to. I felt like I was in some type of music video or commercial. The patrons and servers were so over saturated with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yelling \"action\" from the top of his lungs! I mean, he had to yell because you couldn't hear your own thoughts over the music the DJ had streaming over every table and like clockwork he had an ultra-annoying horn blow ever few minutes. As if that were not enough, every few seconds there was a voice reminding us that the guy controlling the sounds was a \"world-class DJ.\" There were girls fist-pumping, servers dancing while pouring wine, and people grinding between tables. I think I actually rubbed my eyes to make sure I was not dreaming! I grew up in Vegas, by way of the military (my dad was in the Air Force). I don't know if Las Vegas has always been like this or I can now see how semi-cheesy it is... Whatever the case, people were having fun and that was nice. More pics on my blog",

The only reason I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 is that I found the knife to cut my steak was not strong enough.  I did get a cheaper end steak but it was by no means a cheap steak, and if I'm at a fancy steak house, I shouldn't have to mildly struggle to cut my steak.",

It is the single greatest thing I've ever tasted and I don't even know if it's good Foie Gras. It's the only Foie Gras I've ever had. But I will be having it at every opportunity. Thank you STK for the memories.",

The dj was phenomenal and had a great way of playing music geared toward everyone. The ambiance was perfect for dinner. The service was exceptional, I just felt a little rushed with my food. Plates that weren't finished were being removed from the table here and there. The food was amazing. I loved the Cherry Pie Merlot (Or Cab, I cant remember) was amazing and I hate red wine usually. I can drink a whole bottle. The filet sliders and tuna tartare was delicious as well. I would 10/10 recommend.",

I'm going to save everyone the food review because  people are going to come here whether or not I liked the steak. My experience was a 5 star experience because of one of their waitresses, Amy. My girlfriends' dress was literally bursting by the seams and Amy took a safety pin OFF HER OWN SHIRT to give to my friend to mend her dress. She then promptly excused herself to her locker and brought more safety pins. This is an example of someone who will \"give you the shirt off their back\", or the safety pin off their shirt. This awesome example of girls helping girls needed to be recognized. Next time you're at STK Vegas, ask for Amy",

STK Vegas did not disappoint in any way. During our business dinner we enjoyed STK ( which is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel) We skipped the apps we were there for the big boy cuts..Rib Eye (34 oz) Most of the table ended up getting the Rib Eye and 1 had the NY Bone in Strip which was fantastic Oscar style. Blue crab was a nice touch. To finish off the dinner we shared the cookie sundae and the STK donuts...Mmmm. warm fluffy and oh so good. A great place for dinner while at Vegas amazing steak cuts with a contemporary environment, music and vibe was great. Make sure to make RSVPs as it gets packed. We went on a Monday night and would had waited an hour or more! Enjoy",

Located on the third floor of the Cosmo hotel, you'll see dim lighting and hear poppin' music, and feel like you're going to have the best night before even checking in with the hostess.   If you're here just for appetizers, the seafood selection is AMAZING. I recommend the oysters and the yellowfish crudo if you're feelin' raw. Oh, and the sliders are so juicy - you'll forget you're eating just a baby burger.   Sit at the bar or ask for a table. Big groups or small groups, young or old. Anyone would have a good time here. This is my go-to spot now whenever I'm in Vegas.",

Mashed potatoes were downright runny (like powdered).  I'm sure they weren't.  Mushrooms - fine. Asparagus - eh.  Spinach - whatever.  They did have a great wine list - but is that unique in Vegas?  Ruth's Chris, Fleming's, and Capital Grille all better food.  If you want to actually talk to your guests - those options are much better.    However, if you want a loud, crowded, eclectic, contemporary atmosphere with music like a night club - this is your place!   The look is outstanding and unique.  It looks and sounds like a dance club.  The playlist was exceptional.    Just not the atmosphere to eat a fine steak.  We'll have a few drinks there and then go somewhere else for dinner next time.",

The simple reason is that these are the only two Vegas steakhouses I've been to that have never messed up my steak, which is just an unforgivable sin at the price point that these places are asking.  I'm also a huge fan of STK's appetizers and sides. The mushroom pot pie is to die for and the lobster mac and cheese is among the city's best. I also love the beef tartare and crab tortellini appetizers.  One aspect in which I think they've improved immensely in the past year or two is the wine selection. They have some really great selections and vineyards featured that aren't typically found in most Vegas restaurants. On a recent visit, for example, I had a phenomenal offering from Moone Tsai.  The restaurant can be noisy and even rowdy especially on weekend nights, but I'll continue to forgive it for the consistent execution and great food and wine quality.",

The only issue you will have is that your entire part needs to be there in order to be seated so plan ahead.  If you love seafood then you must get the seafood platter.

Our waitress was really nice and attentive and I was impressed by how often the servers came by to refill our waters, remove our plates, etc.  The blue cheese buttered bread was soooo heavenly. And I don't even normally like blue cheese! I ordered the 8 oz wagyu flat iron steak, and shared the creamy yukon potatoes and brocollini as our sides. The steak was cooked PERFECTLY. Probably the BEST steak I've ever had in my life. I got mine medium rare and it was just red enough and sooo so tender and juicy. The steak had so much flavor!  I ordered a side of the red wine sauce but honestly, I barely even touched it because the steak was sooo flavorful on its own. The potatoes were a nice consistency and the brocollini was delicious.  Probably one of the best meals I've had in Vegas. Can't wait to find an excuse to come back again!!",

I ordered the steak in a medium, and my husband got his medium rare. They came out perfectly cooked. The pot pie was hearty and flavorful. I don't ever see a mushroom pot pie anywhere, so it was a pleasant side option. The bread that comes free is also tasty. We didn't do any dessert but would love to try something next time. I also want to take a moment to appreciate the DJ! The music was amazing. He had a lot of the diners dancing in their seats. I loved the vibe at STK. It's like a classy lounge with ah-mazing food. That's a winning combo. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food and ambience.",

STK has a party like atmosphere that just sets a great positive and upbeat tone to the night. It's on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo, so it kind of gets you in the mix of all things happening around there. Again, great place to start the party!",

You would think that they would make sure the very first people you interact with are welcoming and inviting... but no. On all occasions, the hostesses have left me feeling like I should not be dining there.",

    "text": "Upscale restaurant and nightclub? Only in Vegas baby! Very unique!  I did not do my research on this place before visiting. All I knew is that it is one of the more popular upscale restaurants in Vegas compared to Prime and others. We were staying in the Cosmopolitan so we didn't have far to go. We had a reservation for 10:15pm and we were seated about 6 minutes after we arrived. This place is not as big as it looks in pictures. Everything is very close and when it's packed, it's hard to move around. Our server (I don't know his name but he looks like John Cena to me) was amazing! He care over and talked to us a few times until our food arrived and he made sure we were well taken care of. My boyfriend and I both ordered the filet...I had a lobster tail...and mashed potatoes. Everything was perfect. Absolutely delicious! The complimentary bread was great although I hate blue cheese. We were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary so they gave us a free mini dessert (chocolate mousse and whipped cream with a macaroon and a strawberry). This place is expensive but the food is worth it!   My only complaint is....IT IS LOUD. EXTREMELY LOUD. The music is loud (great DJ) and everyone is yelling to hold a conversation over the music. It is impossible to hold a conversation in here. If you are looking for something romantic and intimate for a date night, this is not the place. If you want a place to eat expensive food  and get turned up before going to an actual club, this is perfect!",

By the time I arrived, they were just wrapping up dessert and I knew I didn't have enough time to eat. However, I requested for a glass of water and to see the menu from our waitress Max (I was interested in seeing their menu and pricing for a future visit). At first Max appeared to be kind by agreeing to providing the requested items. About 20 minutes later, I didn't get a menu or my glass of water, but we were told we needed to leave because a group of people have been waiting on our table for 45 minutes. Needless to say, I was highly disappointed and upset at the lack of professionalism of that waitress and the establishment.  Though I was told the food was good, I DO NOT want to spend my money where it is not accepted. Period.",

    "text": "After my last visit, the assistant GM kindly reached out and asked me to give STK another try. This past weekend I did just that and WOW am I glad I did!   We (party of 4) were promptly seated in a spacious booth. We were attended to by a fantastic waitress, Allyson, who made our night even better with incredible service. We started off with the crispy lobster tails, burrata salad and beef carpaccio. The lobster tails came with an excellent chili sauce that really gave off some good heat. The burrata salad was just as delicious as the last time I had it. The carpaccio and pesto noodles were my favorite. So tender and flavorful, the beef practically melted in your mouth.   For mains, my husband and one of our friends each had the 16oz sirloin while myself and our other friend each had filets-mine the 6oz and hers the 10oz. The gentlemen devoured their sirloins without offering us a taste so I can only assume it was good. My filet was once again, just ok. Great char on the outside and perfect temp on the inside but not as tender as I would have liked or expected. I would skip that next time and try one of the other entrees.  I will say the horseradish sauce and STK bold sauce were both amazing. Not overwhelming on the heat but just enough kick to wake you up.   For sides we ordered the mushrooms, yukon mashed, truffle fries, and the corn pudding. Overall, the sides were just an afterthought to me. I wasn't blown away by any of them and the mushrooms were incredibly salty this time. The mashed would've benefited from some salt and pepper or garlic. Our friends enjoyed the corn and fries but neither of them were impressed. I would definitely still recommend the jalapeno grits and I wish I had just gotten them instead.   After all this food, somehow we managed to order dessert. The table split the freshly baked cookie and sweet potato doughnuts. I didn't even get to take pictures of either of these dishes because my tablemates literally inhaled them both. I was able to steal a few bites of each and I can absolutely attest to them both being incredible. The cookie was so soft and just barely baked so it retained some of that raw cooke dough flavor in the middle. The doughnuts, which are something I never in a million years would have thought that I'd like, were beyond delicious. Moist with a beautiful glaze and accompanied by a silky smooth quenelle of ice cream. The perfect pairing if there ever was one.   While there were just a few let downs this time, I'm so glad we gave STK another try. Impeccable service and excellent food really combine to make the full experience here. I would definitely stop by here the next time I'm in town (if only to have more of those doughnuts!).",

The truffle mushroom was very salty. Ehh, only had two scoops. We were there on Christmas Day, and they were pretty busy, so we gave understanding to the chef for maybe under par performance. They had a DJ, so the ambiance was pretty hit. And the staffs were nice, friendly and energetic. So we will come back to give a second try. At the last, when we see the bill and credit card receipt, we thought it was funny: because they already charged 20% tips (not service fee), and they still want the customers to leave gratuity. Haha, maybe for some happy gambler. Hey, it's Vegas, anything is possible!",

    "text": "This restaurant is not bad by any means. I came to STK wanting to compare to other steakhouses I have visited on the strip.  My previous experiences of similar steakhouse include Ruth's Chris (Harrahs) and The Striphouse (Planet Hollywood).  My visit to STK was the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. It was busy and nearly impossible to get a reservation at a decent time. But we found a way, and got in at 8pm. It was packed.   Me and my buddy were walked to our table and the immediate difference of STK to the other above mentioned was the environment.  There was loud music playing and the bar area was filled with people standing. Felt like a restaurant within a small club.   The menu was similar to the other restaurants, with STK seemed a small percentage higher in price. Maybe because of its location in the Cosmopolitan. As me and my buddy enjoyed steaks at the competitors very much, we decided to order a comparable meal. Between us, we ordered the filet, sirloin, mashed potatoes and corn (actual names I do not remember; you can refer to menu).  Filet- tenderness 8/10. Soft, but doesn't melt like Ruth's. Flavor 5/10. Flavor was absent entirely. Appearance/presentation 7/10. Looked fine, but was not served hot, but rather warm.   Sirloin- 8/10 overall.  Was obviously not as tender as the filet, but it had much more flavor. This steak was good for a tougher steak of course.   Mashed- good, but nothing spectacular.  Corn- a bit too sweet and pasty for our taste. Maybe it's a preference thing, but seemed as it should be on dessert menu. My buddy wouldn't eat more than the first bite.   Drinks were solid in taste. At just under $20/drink I am happy this was spot on. Tried three different ones.  Don't remember all their names, Enjoyed the Cucumber stiletto. Sunset (tequila drink) and strawberry cobbler.    Service. Everyone was friendly and delivery was quick. Took a bit to get our check with empty glasses, but they were slammed on MDW and wasn't much of an issue.   Return? Not by choice; maybe if a friend insisted. Taste and quality goes to Ruth's.",

Definitely make a reservation well in advance. We did so we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes.  Very nice ambience in the restaurant and they placed great music. Outside of the restrooms a man in a bow tie had a table full of all sorts of toiletries, for a tip, of course. I was surprised they only had one male and one female restroom stall for the entire restaurant. When the line got longer, the gentleman did inform people there were more restrooms outside of the restaurant in the hotel -- but, I for one, didn't want to make that trek out of the restaurant through the hotel in my heels.  Expect to pay top dollar ($$$$). My friends thought the food was great but I just wasn't super impressed and thought it was A-OK, especially for the price. The bread comes warm and is served with a yummy oil dipping sauce. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. Steaks are $50+ dollars for small cut of meat. Steak was good but not the best I've ever had. Everything is a la carte. The $12-15+ sides are family style and to me, the mashed potatoes and spinach were pretty average. I've had better and I could make them more seasoned and delicious at home myself.   It's Vegas so for a nice steakhouse I expected to pay top dollar - I just wasn't head over heals in love with the food.",

    "text": "Question to STK: what's the point of having a reservation if it still takes another 45 minutes to be seated? Running 15 to 20 minutes late I can understand, but 45 minutes? That's just a terrible look for STK.   Another question for STK: do you find it acceptable that none of your hosts, servers, or managers ever acknowledged that they seated a party 45 minutes after their reservation? No offers to buy a round of drinks or appetizers as an acknowledgment that your guests waited so long? Heck, I would've settled for a simple heartfelt apology. We didn't get that either. It was almost like your staff couldn't be bothered to show minimal courtesy or empathy. I used to be a host and server myself. If I treated anyone like we were treated I would have been fired on the spot.  Bottom line: the way STK treated my party was incredibly disrespectful. My friends and I were really looking forward to this dinner, and as good as the food was, I still have a very bad taste in my mouth.  UPDATE: After the response below, Lilli sent a direct message asking for my email address so someone can reach out to me. I thanked him and gave him my address. One week later and I still haven't heard a word. Can't say I'm surprised. This place does NOT care about its customers. Don't let them fool you into thinking that they do.

My friend and I split a 10 oz filet ($48) and a 24 oz porterhouse ($65).  The porterhouse was an immense cut of beef, even after splitting it up, but the ten ouncer was the star of the show.  Not gonna lie when I'm saying it was one of the best steaks I've had.  The medium rare filet was nice and bloody, but not overly rare in the middle of the cut.  It was really THAT good.  Each bite was, well, pretty damn amazing.  For a high-end steakhouse, the price to quality ratio was pretty reasonable and hands down one the best cuts of cow I've ingested to date.      Top notch service.  Top notch cuts.  Top notch steakhouse!",

We thought this was a missed opportunity for the restaurant to sell us drinks and appetizers.  Once seated, the service was great.  Staff was friendly and attentive, but the food was subpar.  Unfortunately, only one person was pleased with dinner.  She ordered the short rib.  Others ordered steaks and complained they weren't cooked as requested. I ordered the kale salad and fish special ($58). The salad was okay, but the fish was underwhelming.  It was bland and wasn't cooked through.  Sadly, I enjoyed my $8 breakfast the next day more than my $115 meal at STK.",

We were about to leave. - Tiny bathroom! long waiting line for ladies and men! - the worse part is the music! WAY TOO LOUD! I did not enjoy the restaurant ambiance at all because we were not able to talk and hear each other.  I DO NOT recommend this restaurant",

The wait to be seated was not long because we had reservation.  The wait for our food was very long.  The line to the restroom was also long.  The music was extremely loud and inappropriate for children under age...I asked the hostess if that was the norm and she said YES!

We got a wedge salad and foie gras as appetizers. Both were absolutely amazing. The broccolini was delicious but too much oil on it.   Now here is why only 4 stars and not 5: 1)The in house Dj was so loud you really have to raise your voice to talk to someone.  2)The steak is average quality. I've had better at other places. I got the bone-in filet. It was still delicious but I was expecting amazing.  3)The wine is over priced even for Vegas in my opinion. Also the variety isn't great, the low end wines ex: chateau st Michelle Riesling was about 65 for a bottle. They definitely need to revamp their selection.",

For sides, we had the sweet corn pudding, truffle fries and lobster mac n cheese.  The lobster mac was by far the star.  Not as rich as other macs I have had, but the flavor was excellent.  Big pieces of lobster throughout and a nice crusty top.  The truffle fries fell short and were the least favorite of the table.  Needed more seasoning.  The little big macs and shrimp cocktail were excellent appetizers.  Service was great.  Our wine/water glasses were never empty, but we didn't feel like they were hovering around us.  An excellent meal and would recommend it.  Wine list is pretty good for the strip, but pricey as all places are.  They also have about 15-20 choices by the glass.",

Service was really nice, although there were some servers who thought they were entertainers and clapped in my ears really loudly to the beat of the music every time they passed by.

Expect to spend $100pp+ if you want an adult beverage along with you app & entree.  Worth it, just set the right expectations in your mind...it's an experience!",

They have a DJ (but not too loud) who plays upbeat music to keep your energy high if you're planning on staying out afterwards.  Not necessarily a place for romance, though.  The food is pretty good and the cocktails are outstanding.  I definitely recommend topping your steak with the truffle butter.  Service was a tad slow but when our waitress was around she was knowledgable and friendly.   You MUST try the sweet potato doughnuts for dessert!",

Most recently I came here for dinner and my friend and I shared the 20 oz. bone in ribeye (cooked perfectly medium rare, but underwhelmed on flavor), beef tartare (small portion but good quality and flavor), truffle mac and cheese (yum!), and cauliflower gratin (not bad; I'm indifferent on cauliflower so not the best judge of this dish). We also received a complimentary cookie and ice cream dessert from the waiter - super sweet of him (and no, it's not because he messed up on or order or anything like that, his service was IMPECCABLE). One downside, we brought our own bottle of wine and found out corkage was $50. From my experience, I usually pay around $30-$35 for the corkage fee in nicer restaurants (we went to Scarpetta the next night and corkage was only $35 there). I thought $50 was pretty steep. Overall, good experiences at STK though. I would come back again. Not my favorite restaurant for steak, but would come back mainly for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for STK and unfortunately they were not quite met. We went on a bustling Friday night and were immediately seated in the bar area. I love the look of the place; from the white washed brick to the cool slotted walls. The decor is very hip and trendy. There is even a DJ, but beware it does get quite loud in there. The lighting was also a little weird, my husband basically had a spotlight on his side of the table and anytime something white (a plate or napkin) hit the light it was blinding.   After taking in the scenery, we were greeted with melted bleu cheese bread with a chive dipping sauce. Bleu cheese is one of those things that you either love or hate and unfortunately I hate it. I found it an odd choice since it does have such a strong flavor, but I was able to enjoy the middle of the bread and the sauce was very different from anything I had tasted before.  We started with the foie gras french toast and it was disgusting! It is literally french toast, a roasted apple, and a giant slab of foie gras. I can see how it would work for some people but it just didn't work at all for me. We went out on a limb on this one and we fell out of the tree!  My husband got the bone in rib-eye and it was heaven. It was the perfect combination of fat and meat. I had the small filet and it was also spectacular. It was tender, even though I like my meat on the well done side. We didn't opt for any toppings but we did try the chimichurri sauce and it really wasn't worth it. The steaks came with a small side of onions and they were an unexpected highlight. I had regular sauteed onions but my husband had spicy onions that were delicious with the steak. They absolutely know how to cook a mouth-watering steak here!  We also tried 2 sides, but both were disappointing. The mac and cheese would be absolutely stunning if it had any flavor at all. It has a perfect crispy topping and is cheesy but there is really no flavor. Even a little salt would have taken the dish to the next level.   We also tried the mushroom pot pie. When the server brought it out I was so excited to dive into it, but then the unthinkable happened, he cut the top off and dumped it on a plate! I wanted to scream out, but resisted the urge. The mushroom flavor was so overpowering and I love mushrooms. It really needed more pastry, we only had the thin top and it was buried under all the filling. It was so sad.  Overall, the service was great and the steak was delicious, but what's a steak without sides? There are many other places in Vegas that can cook a great steak and provide me with excellent side options. Sorry STK you and I are just not meant to be.",

Visiting Vegas for the week from NYC where I have had great experiences at their midtown NYC location. This restaurant had sub-par food, steaks, sides and overall prices really didn't justify the costs.   Coming from someone who lives in NYC, I'm not one to complain about things that cost more than usual, it's just that when our steaks came, they weren't rich and flavorful like they tasted at the other location. I asked my three other dinner companions and they all agreed whole-heartedly that it was a pretty big disappointment.  My last comment is on the restaurant itself. Compared to other locations, it seems like they really didn't invest much to pump the ambience, it's lit up bright.",

The whole dinner could be ruined but that drink will not be. The steak and mac and cheese were orgasmic. Not happy that they charge $5 for a ramekin of horseradish cream sauce.   Had a gift card that could take care of the whole dinner and the idiot couldn't process it. He made it sound like it was my problem. It was issued by your restaurant, not sure why it was my issue. He actually asked it I wanted to use the gift card or pay by other means. I just about lost it. I still have nightmares about the stupidity of that statement since gift cards are just as good as cash.   If you work in the industry you'll get 25% off on Mondays after 9 p.m.",

We ordered our food and the wait staff continued to ask if we were finished with our salad multiple times even though we were still working on it. I know it is tough for a wait staff to get stuck with a 10 top but you shouldn't feel like you are being herded through a chow line.  We ordered creamed spinach as a part of our main course and when they served it, they conveyed it was sauteed spinach.  When my wife asked if it was creamed spinach the other waiter conveyed he wasn't sure since he didn't serve it but given he had worked there for 5 years it looked like it to him. I conveyed that if he believed it was, that was fine, we just wanted to check.  His response came off snarky when it was simple/innocent question.  In total, the bill for my wife and I came to $300 and for the price we felt extremely rushed and hurried to leave.  Las Vegas prides itself on its service and this experience left me extremely disappointed.  My wife and I have eaten at a lot of higher end restaurants in Las Vegas and this was by far the worst experience for the price.  If you're looking to spend a lot of money only to leave disappointed than this is the place for you!",

If you go as a twosome then you'll likely be sitting right in between two other couples in fairly close quarters. It's loud and busy. I enjoy going in a larger group, 4 or more, and sitting in a booth. Not the place you want to go for a quiet dinner. This is more of a pre party type of dinner or celebration dinner, in my opinion. You can see stars here if your timing is right. Halle Barry, Kevin Hart, Christy Mack and the list goes on and on. I always stay at the Cosmopolitan hotel when I visit Vegas and it's nice to have one of the most fun and beautifully decorated steak houses on the strip right there in the hotel.

It was crowded with good music you can dance to. #1 bread is amazing. #2 caprese salad was not on the menu because it's new: for cheese lovers only. #3 I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the market fish.. both were absolutely delicious and went perfectly with white wine :) Yes it's pricey but very much worth it! Very classy and friendly environment.",

Went with a group of total of 5 girls. They brought a magnum bottle of Moet for the table, we were VERY happy girls. Had the organic chicken for dinner but I wish I would've gotten the tuna.   Only thing I didn't like about the restaurant was the music was SO loud, especially for a dinner. It was almost as loud as a nightclub. Good music but we had to scream to each other to be able to hear what we were saying",

People were dancing near the bar. It was a great place to hang at. The DJ was playing awesome music.  Unfortunately, I wanted to talk to my dinner guests a little more, so this wasnt the right place for that. Plus the food was just ok. Steak was mediocre at best.  I would say some here for the great music and have a few drinks and light appetizers. But for a real steak house, there are much better options on the strip.",

Negative 1 star; Not honoring a reservation made 2 months in advance until an hour after the reservation time...Negative 1 star; Taking a reservation for 12, when not a table in the place is big enough for comfortably sit 8...Negative 1 star.  OK, I won't be going back to STK.    It's way too loud for anything except a dance club, let alone a (theoretical) steak restaurant...they're trying too hard to be cool.  This means not even a two person table could have a diner conversation; but if a dinner date without talking is for you, then this could be the place.  Might as well bring earplugs...the 80s music isn't worth listening to anyway.  Not a place for large parties.  I planned on a nice dinner with a group of friends and celebrating a birthday.  Shame on STK for even taking a reservation for 12 and confirming it 24 hours ahead of time, if the restaurant isn't set up for large groups.  Almost all of the tables are fixed booths, so there's no re-arranging...and the booths are pretty much 6 to 8 people comfortably.  It would have been nice to have known, before everyone is sitting in each other's lap for an expensive dinner.  The waiter was pleasant and efficient, the food was OK.  Host staff was useless.  I was a guest at The Cosmopolitan, but STK is the worst part of the hotel.",

Made reservations for 4 and were seated quickly with prompt service and a personable wait staff.  The food was as expected and worth every penny.   The bread was hot and delicious and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I was adventurous and ordered the jalapeno onion topper on top of my filet and enjoyed every bite.  Mac was cheesy and the asparagus had a nice kick of zest. The music was great and brought back memories of years past.  Props to the DJ for his mash-ups.  My only disappointment was that our Moscow Mules were not served in copper mugs due to customers stealing them. STK was where I first was introduced to that drink and raved about them to my brother and girlfriend only to have them served in a highball.",

Ask for Brian - he was awesome.  Top notch service!    I ordered Bone-In Rib steak and it was perfectly cooked to medium rare, perfectly seasoned.  I ordered the red wine sauce... and it was just okay, but I didn't need the sauce at all.  (I usually eat my steak without sauces though).    We also ordered 3 different sides.  My favorite was Mushroom Pot Pie.  It tastes like truffle bisque soup trapped in a...  pot pie.  Hard to describe this one but man... it was awesome.   Grit and corn were great as well.    Very highly recommended.  Ask for Brian!",

The waiter rushed us and asked \"are you done now?\" Didn't ask if we wanted to take any food to go and just grabbed our plates while one of my friend was still eating. So we took our time to order and eat desserts and left 10% tip instead of 20% on 400$ tab. No need to be rude when you're making minimum wage, idc if you're busy, they shouldn't have booked 100 ppl in a 50ppl max capacity room.

We always go to the Cosmopolitan and blindly search for a restaurant. I say this because, there are so many incredible options there that you really can't go wrong. We decided on STK because we were all in the mood for some good old-fashioned, American steak dinners. The ambience is so cool there. You automatically feel like a trendy 20-year-old when you walk in. All of the servers look like high fashion supermodels, it's playing the latest pop music, and The light scheme and overall ambience really adds to the trendy mood. Now, to the food. They serve you a delicious bread bun, with pesto sauce. There are a lot of great food options, but you can't go to Italy and not eat pasta, or go to France and not eat cheese, or go to America and not eat a steak... Get my point? Get the steak! Literally any one of them will be amazing. We got the ribeye and his parents got The fillet. We drank a fancy glass of Italian wine and also shared the Barada salad. As you can tell by my recent Yelp posts, I'm really into Burrata salad lately. The service was great, the only hiccup is that my wineglass had lipstick prints on it. Our server seemed embarrassed about that and got it taken care of right away. Of course, it was an expensive dinner, but we were celebrating and on vacation. It was well worth it, now I am excited to try the one in Los Angeles.",

The oysters they were serving last night was my favorite, Kusshi oysters.  The Mac and cheese side and brocollini side also are fantastic to go with your steak.  I ended up getting the bone in filet, which was cooked to a perfect medium rare and I topped it with foie gras which complimented the steak perfectly.  For desert, we got the chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream on top, this was mouthwatering.  We also got the sweet potato donuts which was also really good.  The drinks are also good.  Overall, great spot to take a date or go with a group of friends.  I recommend getting a bunch of sides and sharing them.",

    "text": "I came to Las Vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. It is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"Sex and the City!\" It is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd.   Everyone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. I felt like I was in that movie \"Oceans 11\" with George Clooney..  I came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.  Appetizers:  They give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. It comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. It is really a tasty treat.  Salad: They have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. It is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.  Entrees:  I ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. My waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. When they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. I ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. It was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.  My colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees.   We ordered several different sides and I would rate them as the following:  Creamy Corn:  This was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. It had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robust corn flavor.  Jalapeno Cheese Grits:   Green Jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. It had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.  Mushroom pot pie:    This is a great dish to order on the side. Its basically mushrooms sauteed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. I enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. The flavor combination was intense.  The wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. I forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.  DESSERT:   They have a pistachio and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. It is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its AMAZING! It is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.  This is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in Vegas for a special dinner or night out with friends. One of the better Steakhouses in Las Vegas!",

Even BLT from Bally's is way better then STK. worth to try once but after once you will look for a real steakhouse. Prime at Belagio is my choice",

I ordered the creamy yukon potatoes with the 10 oz filet. My guy ordered the 20 oz bone in filet, if I'm not mistaken; it was HUGE. We literally could have shared his steak and the both of us would have been more than satisfied.",

    "text": "My last review of STK LV was not as favorable. We had a really awful experience and when the management read my last review, they reached out & wanted to make things right.   Last nights experience was a complete 180 from the last. We were SO grateful to all of the staff that made everything perfect & us want for nothing. You guys went above & beyond and I am truly thankful.   We were greeted by Manager Clayton who lead us to our table and assured us that things would be totally different. Our server Brad, was nothing short of AMAZING. Seriously great personality and SO on top of his game, he puts all other servers from all other restaurants I've been to, to shame! We loved Brad!   Clayton was kind enough to offer us drinks, champagne to start and then we ordered apps. Specifically, The Burrata, the BRGs, & the Beef Carpaccio. (I had to sample everything) and WOW! The flavor combo's, freshness & inventiveness of the dishes were SO good. The Burrata was not all skin like a lot of places, the tomatoes & sauce were so fresh & delish. The angel hair that was paired with the beef carpaccio was excellent and let's not forget the BRG's, those little burgers were flavor packed, not greasy and SO tasty! I almost forgot their signature bread in the beginning, so indulgent but oh so good. The pesto was divine.  In between a very busy night with tons of orders in the kitchen, the chef was kind enough to come out and personally introduce himself and apologize for our last experience. (which to be fair, was not his fault, it was mostly due from a very nasty server we had) He really didn't have to come say hello, I know how busy it is in the kitchen and we really appreciated that gesture. Very nice.   (the Dj playing top 40s and mixing in oldie's made the atmosphere really fun)  On to the Mains, we each ordered a steak, how can you not at a place that's well known for their meat? Mine was the porterhouse done medium, the temp was perfect, the flavor was great, the jalepeno onions had a nice kick to them which topped my steak. The sides I ordered were broccolini, creamed spinach-YUM, mashed potatoes-good, and I didn't sample the others...I was getting full. The best side for me was the one the chef specially prepared. There is an entree with Spaetzle, a favorite indulgence of mine that isn't easy to find anywhere. They made sure I had a a special side of Spaetzle and Chef's twist on it was SO good! Very talented I have to say ;)   Brad & Christian (his assistant who was also on top of it & awesome) made sure we didn't even ask for refills & kept all of our waters/drinks replenished. They made sure all of the dishes were exceptional & their graciousness was so appreciated!   After almost having to unzip my dress, it was time for dessert. The choc chip cookie was recommended as the best and it was certainly tasty, but the donuts??? OMG, if there was one dessert I could chose for a cheat meal, this would be it! I was so full, but managed to indulge a little more.   One last cheers, thanked our gracious hosts & the night concluded with us feeling so grateful that we had been so well taken care of. It would have been one thing for STK to cover apps or a main each but they completely took care of the entire bill to make up for our terrible time last. They went well above & beyond.   The people at STK are committed to providing not only excellent food but superior service and gaining repeat customers...which they certainly have in us. Thank you all again! Until next time!  Cheers!",

Beautiful people, beautiful bartenders and some bomb ass eats. Good times to be had all around.   So, on to the black out moments. Well, Sunday brunch, not so much a blackout, hence why I remember the experience. Tara was our server, she was awesome. A bunch of us gals got together and she succumbed to our every whim. She was very accommodating, patient, and gave spectacular service. **And we all know, waiting on a bunch of beezies is rigorous** Everything was awesome. Short rib hash was the tits and the Bloody Mary bar was epic. However, I think they no longer do brunch and this makes me wanna cry like a teenage girl who has had her heart broken.  The other night, another ratchet Vegas night to start at STK. No carbs, one too many shots and an uber ride home later, thank you STK. Dinner was amazeballs. Michael and Ed took care of us,  and one of them suggested the rib cap special. Oh. Em. Gee. Melt in your mouth. Then the brussel sprouts on the side, mind blown. Washed down with Not Your Daddy's Manhattan, granted I don't have a Daddy but I felt like a Sugar Baby for a hot minute. The guys were great, almost like I wanted to invite them to rally with us after they finished their shift. Fun and made sure our menu choices were legit.   Finished with a cocktail at the bar with Kevin. Sounds basic but I wanted an espresso martini. #basicbitch Seriously, an amazing espresso martini. Enough juice to get me through the night...",

Always loved the food, atmosphere, service, etc...But my past few visits have provided extremely long waits with reservation (45mins!) and food that seems to get more mediocre every time we've gone recently.  Maybe they are getting complacent because they are still packing them in all these years,  or being that the quality and food choices of the other venues at Cosmopolitan -like Zuma or Beauty & Essex is just better is up for discussion.  But with Vegas having so many great dining choices, one would hope STK steps it up because it sure is a fun spot. p.s. Bartenders (esp Stephanie) are above excellent.",

    "text": "STK is how I imagine it was like dining in a fancy restaurant in the 80s. Its decor has a subtle \"Miami Vice\" look and feel.  Oh, but forget that and focus in on the food. Much of the menu items might sound familiar, but STK interprets these dishes their own way.   A friend and I dined here for an early dinner. We were seated by the hostess at a tiny table, which was closely situated next to other tiny tables. It was impractical and not intimate to say the least, but we dealt with it.   Appetizer - Bread: Compliments of the restaurant, we received pull-apart bread slathered with blue cheese butter, served in a small cast iron plate.   Appetizer - Seared Foie gras: This was like eating breakfast for dinner. The foie gras was accompanied by three miniature pancakes and marmalade. Delightful.   Entree - Seared Big Eye Ahi: This was heavily seasoned with a Japanese spice that proved to be too hot for my gut to handle. Our server gladly had my dish remade without seasoning, and served with the wasabi mashed potatoes and miso sauce on the side. Overall, my meal  was exceptional, and I especially liked the wasabi mash.   Dessert - Chocolate Chip Cookie with Ice Cream- This was one hot cookie topped with vanilla ice cream that can be shared by two people. The cookie was baked and presented in another  mini cast iron pan. It was a delicious way to top off dinner.  STK has become one of my favorite restaurants at The Cosmopolitan. I do recommend coming here to experience dinner. The downside, as I've mentioned, is the seating. Reservations are encouraged.",

    "text": "Few meals in Vegas stood out but this one definitely did.  Why it's STKastic +'s: + Bone in filet. Get it medium rare PLUS otherwise it just won't be bloody enough. + Cocktails are strong.  + Garlic bread served in break-off molds. Perfect! I love just grabbing a piece off rather than cutting through it. + Side that stood out: parmesan truffle fries are all the rage and the thick cuts are perfect. + Fun DJ on a Saturday night that got guests out of their table to dance. + Great friendly service.  Why I'll slip out -'s: - Wines start at $80 per bottle. Not my thing. - Sides are $15 extra each. - Forgettable sides to pass: burrata, romaine (meh it's alright), lobster tail because it's $30 and mushroom pot pie because crust was paper thin.  Before tip we hit $800 for five persons that included steaks for all, two bottles of wine, round of cocktails, 5 apps, 5 sides and no dessert.  Overall I'd return because it was a fun atmosphere with a good crowd. Gets loud and raise your voice to be heard.",

    "text": "While in Vegas, I would recommend a number of other steak houses before recommending STK. The first sign should have been the apathetic hostess that let us know know our reservation was 25 minutes behind which quickly turned into an hour later than our reserved time.  Once in, the atmosphere was fun and energetic. The DJ was able to keep the entire restaurant happy with an upbeat vibe. Thought maybe this would turn around our experience. And unfortunately it stopped about there.   We all ordered steaks and each steak was cooked incorrectly. The medium came out rare and the rare was cooked to a crisp. How do you incorrectly cook steaks at a steak house? Not one, but four slabs of premium meats that you are expected to pay a premium for. This part still baffles me. The variety of sides came out far later than our steaks which was not ideal, but we accepted it. After being the most excited for the lobster Mac and Cheese that was off the menu, it was beyond a disappointment. Lacking all flavor and the sauce was too runny for my liking. We paid the tab and went on our way.  Maybe I feel like there should be a baseline of service and quality when the average ticket is in excess of $100 per person. STK missed the mark by a long shot. Do yourself a favor and check out any of the other restaurants surrounding it or look at other properties for a proper steakhouse.",

Traffic on the strip was a nightmare so we were 20 minutes late, and I called on the way to let them know, and they said no problem.  But then when we got there, the guy in charge of the hostesses was rude about it, and even marked me absent for Open Table.  It was my birthday, and I love going to STK, but this was not the best experience.  We were sat at a lower table - try to get on the upper area with the carpet if you can - and it was super, super loud.  I recommend the tater tots as a side; they were delicious.  The bread is also good.  And any place that has Justin as their house Cab, is nice in my book. Overall, it's a cool place but if you sit near the bar, it's waaaaay too loud, and the place is over-priced even for Vegas standards.",

    "text": "Arrived around 8pm and there was a at least 20 people in line reserving a table for their individual parties.  Some dressed to the nines and other in shorts and T-Shirts.  STK may not have a formal dress code but the ambiance deserves the common courtesy of looking presentable at the very minimum.  I of course decided on my blue pin striped suit with colorful pocket square to add that bit of splash.   I went past the line and straight for the bar since you have access to their full menu. They have two bars here. If the first one is full continue towards the back and you will most likely find an open seat.  The bar tenders were absolute dolls and very attentive, making you feel at home.  With the DJ spinning tracks in the background and with dim lighting, it sets you up for an evening out on the town.   First came out the bread which gets mad reviews from Yelpers across the board. I thought the hype was over the top, turns out it live up to it and plus more.   I started my dinner with a field greens salad which I didn't expect much other than a common mixed greens salad.  It was amazing and definitely worth a try if you liked feta cheese. Beside the vinaigrette which was full flavored it had candied pecans which were succulent.  On to the main course, their Colorado Rack of Lamb. Ordered it medium rare as any respective lamb lover should.  It was seasoned to perfection and sinfully marbled. You are almost forced to gnaw on the bone and since I was at the end of the bar counter, I couldn't help myself and sneaked in a couple of nibbles. It was simply that good.   For desert, on recommendation from the lovely bar tender, I went with the sweat potato donuts with caramelized walnuts. Mind you I hate anything sweet potato but after being referred to as honey, sweetie and babe the whole night I couldn't refuse the recommendation.  I'm glad I did because it was epic and in the top three deserts I have ever had in Vegas. I paired it with a latte and it was to die for. A definite must have.",

Zaban the manager also stopped by to ensure that everything was amazing (which it was)! The atmosphere of STK is chic and trendy with a live dj who played great music during our entire meal. Decadent blue cheese bread with a chive oil is provided and I ordered the filet with truffle butter. The macaroni was our favorite side dish. The baked cookie dessert and sweet potato doughnuts ended our amazing meal. We will definitely return and cannot say enough great things about our experience!",

It was towards the end of our trip where we found ourselves checked out of the hotel but waiting for a later flight sooooo steak it is!  We got here too early to really get the feel of the place but it seemed to be like the NYC STK, a trendy steakhouse.  Ordered a salad and a sirloin as I've been known to do...    Service was solid, server was nice enough and attentive without being overly good or bad in any way.    Salad was a bit of a dissapointment, was sort of a hodpodge between a regular salad and a blue cheese wedge.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  The steak was very solid though.  Ordered rare + and it came out medium rare so that was fine.  Sort of underseasoned but I was able to fix that with the ton of pepper and salt the waitress brought over.  Overall the steak was good to very good but not Del Frisco's/Sparks level.    The sides were pretty good as well, creamed spinach was nice in particular.   There are entirely too many options to ever head back to this place again but I would say if you're in the hotel and hungry it is a solid choice.  Boarderline 3/4 star I'll give it the bump to 4.",

The server recommended we add FoieGras and Truffle butter to top the steak. The steak was common even with all that foie and truffle butter.

What I really disliked was the poor customer service from the manager. I watched as he tried to stop a father and son from entering the establishment. He claimed there was a dress code and they didn't fit it. That would be fine if it was True, but I was sitting next to a guy who looked like he just came off a farm...jeans, t-shirt and cap.  It appeared that the manager had a personal bias towards these two patrons based upon ethnicity, but who knows.  Maybe the guy was just a moron and having a bad night.  Fortunately the manager was extremely unintelligent and was no match for for the father.  He eventually allowed these two guys in when he ran out of excuses. I listened how the father explained to the boy that this type of bias still exists in America but to not let him get discouraged.  This is the story I will be sharing when people ask me how the restaurant was.  Shame on this establishment for hiring such a disgraceful man.",

The tables and booths are crammed together and it is a chore just to get to your seat.  Extremely loud DJ'd music fills the place which was actually pretty fun if this dinner is kicking off your evening in Vegas.  My only real gripe is the food.  I guess I had some high expectations with the overall presentation of the place.  The filet had middle of the road flavor and all of the sides shared by the table were forgettable: creamed spinach, parmesan truffle fries, asparagus...  I will say the mushroom pot pie was pretty good, but that's about the only thing I recall enjoying.  After a bunch of cabernet I believe the bill was large, but who cares about such things when in Vegas?",

    "text": "Went here on a business trip with 8 others.  Probably the loudest \"nice steakhouse\" I've ever been to...  and they said it was fairly calm as it was only a Wednesday night.  The funny thing was that we all agreed the noise became less noticeable as we got drunker lol.  But, if I'm going to a nice place, I'd prefer it to be a place where I can at least hear the people with me.    Drinks and wine were great.  We had the seafood platter appetizer which was the best I've ever had.  Jumbo Shrimp, crab legs, crab, claws, lobster, oysters, and some other stuff.  This was the highlight of the evening for me.    I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye.  I have to say I was a little disappointed in the cut of meat.  I mean, it was huge and it was cooked well, but, for an $85 steak, I expect prime quality.  This did not taste \"prime\" to me.  This is the only part of the night (besides the noise possibly) that keeps STK from getting 5 stars from me.  It cold be that a steak this large is tougher to find \"prime\" quality?  Not sure, I might advise trying the medium cut and seeing if that's any better.    Overall, very good experience though.  A little pricey for me as our total bill came to over $2k for 9 people, but, had a nice time nonetheless.  (Luckily our company paid for it.)  To me, it wasn't worth  $225 per person, probably more like $150-$175 range.  But, then again, we did drink quite a bit.    Also, I have to say that the service was top-notch.  They had 1 main waiter and 2 other people taking care of us.  They did a great job.  One other semi-annoying thing was that they only have 1 single restroom for men and women.  2 stalls for the entire restaurant.  This seems absurd to me.  As I said at the start, they told us it was a quiet night for the place...  But, there was still a line every time I had to use the restroom (which was quite often as we were \"indulging\").  I can't imagine the lines on a weekend.",

This place is a meat market through and through, from your plate to the numerous plastic women and GQ guys walking around.  This is a great place to go, enjoy a real nice steak (I had the cowboy), and see and be seen.  They also had a couple fantastic apps, the beef carpaccio and tuna tar tare really stood out.

We had to yell across the table to make conversation and I lost my voice by the end of the night.  Food was spot on delish! Tried the French Toast and Foie Gras and loved the grilled apple on the side. So good and just enough for our small table to share.  The bread and butter they serve is very yummy, so don't pig out on that before your fabulous food arrives.  I had a filet and it was PERFECT! it had a beautiful char on the outside and melt like butter inside your mouth effect! I usually love to eat my steaks with truffle butter but I opted for some simple horseradish sauce this time and it was bomb. The table also ordered filets, porterhouse, bone in filet.  All good.  Sides: carrots that were sweet and plenty, the mushroom pot pie was not as flavorufl as I was expecting but it was a huge portion as well.  The mac-n-cheese was average but the asparagus was the True winner!   I have to give a big shout out to the STK family for making the night extra special when they went out of their way to arrange the dessert we brought on our own (an order of PYP cupcakes) to celebrate my baby bro's 3-0!  We were going to just order drinks at the Chandelier and eat the cakes on our own but they so graciously offered to arrange them on syrup decorated platters and light the candles for a big birthday display.  Above and beyond these guys!   Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Losing my voice and giving me a splitting headache from the loud music is what only took away from what could have been easily 5 stars.",

    "text": "So this is a 5 star review because if you order the right things-it is amazing.  My husband had bone in ribeye,  and it had great flavor and perfectly cooked.  I had the ahi tuna entree but didn't care for it at all-room temp and pretty sweet-might have been more appealing served cold. But it was my mistakes for ordering it as it wasn't something the server specifically mentioned.  Next time I would go with a steak for sure.  Neither of us cared for the mushroom pot pie but again nothing wrong with item necessarily -just not something we were crazy about.  The tomato and mozerella salad was very tasty. I hate to say anything negative about STK cause we really had fun and enjoyed the drinks and the steak- just wishing I had a do over on my menu choice.  Service was A+ and The atmosphere is fun and loud-great energy for a Vegas Saturday night.  Definitely Get dressed up and check it out.",

Service is hit and miss. My drinks are quite simple and straight up. I don't do a lot of mixers. But I hate being told by someone that the drink is *supposed* to taste that way because we use fresh juice. We ordered a flippin' apple martini and it tasted like crap- twice. Give us the sugar- filled, preservative, bottled mixer because someone who's ordering that probably isn't looking for a handcrafted cocktail.   Save the attitude and your precious squeezed juice.  With that said, I do enjoy coming here as a bar stop on my cruise through the Cosmo.",

The vibe here is amazing. Plenty of attractive people...women dressed up to perfection. It's loud, but not too loud. There isn't actually that much room to grab a drink and hang out without being in the way. However, none of the waiters/waitresses have an attitude about passing through. They very politely ask you to move with an \"excuse me\".  The music was bumpin, and some diners even got up and started dancing in the open areas or, like one woman, on the table behind her booth. I was even more impressed with that. Security was on the scene, but just monitored to make sure she was okay. It wasn't like bouncers in the club who get upset and yell at you to sit down. They assessed the situation, saw that she was in control, and let her (and everyone else) enjoy her dance. Again...customer service goes a long way, and they did it right.   Only minus is that drinks are ridiculously expensive here. I bought a round for 4 people, nothing fancy, and it was about $80. So be prepared, but you'll be sure to have a good time here.",

The DJ goes live daily after 7 spinning the hottest hits creating a very fun atmosphere.  As for the food .  There are so many great selections on the menu it's hard to choose.  I always get the beef carpaccio, beet salad and I'm a sucker for the shrimp cocktail and that's only the starters.  For the main course I would highly recommend the filet mignon as well as the Dover sole.  Don't stop here because you definitely need some side dishes to compliment your dinner.  Do yourself a favor and opt for the truffled Mac n cheese and the sweet corn pudding.  If you have any room for dessert go for the delicious sweet potato donuts..... Yummmmmm.  Magdalena is the best  Wine list is great ... Cocktails are delicious.",

    "text": "This should be a one-word review--Blaaah!  However, I'll give STK it's due. Great atmosphere with sleek chrome and black leather. The service was great but the food was lackluster. We started with salads and I had the baby beet salad which was perfectly presented and the best thing I had this evening.   My colleague and I both ordered the 10oz filet and we shared the Yukon mashed potatoes, the Mac and cheese, and the asparagus with orange jalapeno glaze. The steaks were very tender but lacked any real flavor, they were cooked to an exact medium rare. The Yukon mashed potatoes were a bit on the soupy side and had no form. The Mac and cheese was just that. It was like they took cooked macaroni and topped it with some cheese and baked it. It was not at all creamy and rich. My colleague and I both commented that we tasted neither orange nor jalapeno in the asparagus sauce.  On a side note-I tried to go to the restroom but the line was so long that I was told to come back later. I'm not really sure if the guy who told me that worked there or he just had to go really badly.  Finally, there these three huge bouncer type guys who looked like they were in charge. As soon as the waiter brought the check I was signing when I heard one of these big mooks say to a group of four standing behind us, \"Yeah, these are your seats. I'm just waiting for these guys to get outta here.\" I thought it was very rude. From sit down to exit we were there an hour and five minutes. We spent over $120 each and we only had iced tea to drink.  I'll be back in vegas next month and STK is on a list for us to consider for dining. I will strongly suggest that we spend our time and money somewhere else.",

This time, they were painful.   Last time, we had a great server who wanted to party with us during dinner, AND after. This time: we had a guy take our drink order, presumably take a nap, take our food order, and presumably take another nap. Later,  some random runners brought our drinks and food. The next time we saw our waiter was about 90 mins later when he brought our check and apologized for the drunk guys sitting at our table, hitting on the hooker that was there with their boss, at the table next to us.",

We stood there for 15 minutes as we watched other parties of two being seated ahead of us despite the fact they checked in after us AND we had reservations. Finally went back up to the desk to inquire and the girl working there asked why we hadn't checked in. I told them that we did 15 minutes ago and they bro-manager at the desk muttered \"It was like 10 minutes.\" At any rate, they quickly realized that no one had checked us in and seated us promptly after with no apology for the mix up.   Our server on the other hand, was delightful. Very friendly and attentive. We started with the tartare and the beet salad. Both were yummy. The tartare had truffles shaved on it, so win in my book. My husband got the filet and I got the ribeye. He loved his filet, my ribeye was nothing to write home about. Definitely not the best steak I've ever had. The truffle fries, while good, were over hyped by the Yelpers on here. We also got the carrots and while they were good - they weren't amazing.   I did love my cocktail. It had a bit of heat to it, which I really liked.   Overall started out with a bad experience at check-in followed by a mediocre meal. We also got a stern email from Open Table as \"no-shows\" for our reservation. Icing on the mediocre cake.",

Those times were just too early and too late. We passed by the place around 4 and tried to bribe our way to get a table around 7 and the hostess told us that there was a section (the tall tables) that are first come first serve and they usually fill up by 7. So, we left and two of us came back at about 6:20pm and got a table easily. Out of about 12 or so, after us, there were only 2 tables left and they filled up in 10 min...so if you can't reserve a table, arrive around 6 to get a tall table!  Service was great all night by the busser and waitress. Cleared dirty dishes out quickly and checked on us often. We did bring a bottle of wine ourselves and was told that there was a $50 corkage fee. My friend complained to the waitress saying it was BS to charge that much to open a bottle and politely asked if she could ask her manager to not charge him (since he was a Cosmo VIP guest) or at least reduce the fee. The manager reduced it to $25.  Atmosphere was cool, they have a live DJ playing and he was spinning 80's music the whole time, that was dope. Definitely an upscale resto. They say you're supposed to dress formal/\"nice\" but I came in jean booty shorts, a cropped top and black flats. Other girls were dressed like they were going to a winter formal.   We started off with a dozen of half shell oysters, they were pretty small. Ordered the mac and cheese, it was alright (not a huge mac and cheese fan but the others loved it). Ordered the truffle parmesan fries, these were thicker fries than I thought but they were really good! And for my entree, I ordered the porterhouse to share with my friend because it was such a huge dish. Also got the red wine bbq? sauce on the side, and omg, it was sooooooooo good!! I dipped everything in that sauce! haha. Also ordered the stiletto cucumber cocktail, it's pretty minty, it was good. Friends ordered the chocolate cocktail, not a huge fan of chocolate..but if you're a chocolate lover, this one's for youu!  Overall, everything was great! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Would def come back! Bill came out to about $400, yes very pricey. The best part of it all, the whole meal was comp'd. #WIN.",

I saw a lot of complaints on here about having to wait a long time before being seated, but we were sat within 5 minutes of arriving for our 8:00pm reservation.   The bread that they bring out for table is absolutely amazing. There's a blue cheese glaze that the covers the bread and its fresh out of the oven. We literally plowed through the bread in about 10 minutes.  I then ordered the Kobe sliders for the main course. They were very small, but absolutely delicious. I was still full from lunch, so the small portion was perfect for me. My buddies all enjoyed their meals and one even said the chicken dish was some of the best he ever had.   The music was loud and we loved every minute of it. This is Vegas and if you're looking for a low key experience, you're definitely in the wrong place. The vibe of the restaurant is upbeat, trendy and gets you warmed up for the night ahead. It's definitely expensive, but you're paying for the atmosphere and crowd that comes with it.   It was my friends birthday as well so I mentioned it to the staff and they brought out a complimentary piece of cake for him with a bday candle.  Overall I had an excellent experience at this place. Definitely a must for a group dinner in Vegas.",

Wasn't sure what to expect since the only other high-end steakhouse I've been to is Alexander's.  I don't remember our server's name, but I do remember she was a Dodgers fan but since she was excellent we let that slide :)  I also like it when the servers don't write down our order.  Food was absolutely delicious.  We ordered: *Carpacio appetizer, some of the best I've had and it melted in your mouth.    *10oz. filet with foie gras topping - this is the first time I had foie gras since it is illegal in CA and oh em gee... hella glad I ordered it  *hubby had the bone-in filet - it was rather large, cooked how he wanted it, but couldn't finish it.  I tried it too, and was sooo good  *bread with melted blue chees butter and chive oil - never had anything like it and would love to have it again  Overall, STK was great and when we're back in Vegas, I'm making another reservation!",

Second, I love the hostess and the servers here. Last night I was sick and asked my server for some tissues or napkins. He said he couldn't find any but went to the bathroom and pulled out some toilet paper for me. It was actually really cute and endearing. He didn't want to come back empty handed so he gave me what he could.   Next, tonight I'm here dining by myself with my laptop and working. I asked for a booth for one and normally there are no booths for one---two is the now minimum. They totally made it happen.  And all of my servers were excellent tonight.  Finally, I have to add that the sea bass (daily fish) with the risotto and mushroom were EXCELLENT.",

Good for a hangout but NOT the food. Service was good but would not eat here again.  I don't mind paying for good food, even if it's 500 per steak but paying for over cooked steak is not worth it.  You would think for a place like Vegas they would know.  We had a table of twelve and all agreed the quality was not what was advertised.",

The steak was exactly what I expected, delicious but not especially noteworthy.  As was the wedge salad.  The standouts were the bread and the lobster mac & cheese.  The bread looked like balls of dough had been stuck together in a dish and baked, and then had blue cheese butter drizzled over.  I don't even like blue cheese and I LOVED this.  There was also a chive oil dipping sauce.  The lobster mac & cheese needs no explanation, apart from that it was phenomenal.        I wouldn't say this place is worth a long wait for a table, but it's convenient to those staying in the hotel, and definitely money well spent.",

    "text": "A long & overdue review to a dinner with great company...  Righteous dudes in Vegas (don't even try to make sense of it).  As we were in Vegas for various birthdays, one of the birthday boys decided the group should have one nice dinner together.  Most of us stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  My friend and I looked at the menu and thought this would be a nice place for dinner.  Knowing that you have to work with a coordinator for any parties over a certain number, I contacted our celebrations contact at the Cosmopolitan who said she'd pass on my information.   GROUP RESERVATIONS: *For parties of 13+ guests, you must make a group reservation. I worked with Rose *I believe I was put in the Tempest Storm Private Dining Room - $2,000 food/beverage minimum *A contract will need to be signed & a credit card will need to be put on file *There are 3 set menus to choose from - $85, $100, and $125 options (sides an additional $10) *Note: Prices do not include 8.1% tax or 21% service charge  FOOD: From the set menu I chose the following items: *Hearts of Romaine - Good, it's their version of a Caesar Salad.  You may want to ask light on the dressing as mine seemed tossed in dressing and another layer of dressing added on top of that. *7oz Skirt Steak - Good with great flavoring and cooked medium rare as I requested.  It was served over mashed potatoes and a couple pieces of asparagus. *Molten Chocolate Cake w/Vanilla Ice Cream - Yum! Extremely chocolaty rich and a perfect amount of sweetness to end my meal.  Additions we ordered: *Short Rib Ravioli - Ok. I wish there was more than just shredded short ribs in the ravioli to add a bit more substance to the dish. *Mac & Cheese side - Yum! Extremely rich, creamy, and cheesy. *Truffle Fries side - A must order!  The fries had the perfect crisp to it and the truffle oil and cheese added a delicious touch!  One disappointment?  We didn't get candles on the desserts for the birthday boys. Oh yeah, don't forget to try their bread with the olive oil/chive spread.  It's delicious!  SERVICE: Amy aka A Booty (you'd only know if you take a close look at your bill) and Mark were great.  For once I didn't join in with the rest of the lushes and sipped on one glass of wine the entire dinner (hey, someone had to make sure everything went okay).  As my friends ordered and ordered, Mark & Amy were sometimes missing but one of the various servers in our room was more than happy enough to help.  STK is a hip, modern restaurant with louder than normal music which may make it a bit harder to hear your date.  We had one of the private dining rooms which for whatever reason has padded walls.  The private room was great so we could all hear the speeches we had the birthday boys giving.",

With that being said, this steak might not even cracked the top 10 steaks in Dallas.",

I hate when you have to take the waiter/waitress to the side and tell them it's someone's birthday after explaining over the phone/online prior.  We had a superb waitress, Jax. She knew the menu very well and was very helpful!  The food was excellent!!! Even though I like my steak well done, it just melted in my mouth. Although their truffle fries were not the best I've ever had (that's not what she said, lol), the creamy yukon potatoes made up for it.   So I encourage you to come and check out this spot!",

It's better than Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, Bourbon Steak, BLT Steak, Ray's the Steaks, Charlie Palmer (yes, there are a lot of steak places in DC).  I'm a bone-in ribeye type girl and won't hesitate to ask for the fattiest cut every single time.  STK gets it right every time.  The last time I was there I even added bacon butter to my ribeye.  Yum.  Ambiance is great.  Most of the tables are half booths with spacious chairs on one side of the table.  Plenty of room for everyone.  Decor is as you would expect...dark wood but this place is very modern.  The only thing that would've made me happier would be to have more grass-fed steak options.  Definitely make a reservation.",

The sweet potato donuts are AMAZING! I'm going to try not to sneak back down later this evening for my very own plate :) make sure you save room for those. Or start with them. Might as well insure you have room. For dinner... We ordered the filet rare. It was tender and delicious.  The fish of the day was sea bass and it was buttery with a crispy outer layer. Amazing! We ordered 4 sides The creamed corn, my husband said it was his favorite. It was a little more like a souffle in my opinion. Good taste, sweet but a little fluffy, not like southern creamed corn. Mashed potatoes- Creamy and delicious. Macaroni and cheese- Flavorful. Broccolini- tasty. The other dessert we had was the pana cotta. Hmmm, not great, sadly.   The sides were good. Not to die for but yummy. Usually the sides have me oohing and awing. The main courses were very yummy.  This was probably my 2nd time here in Vegas and we probably dine at the LA location yearly. So I'm sure we will be back.  It's a great restaurant for special occasions. I love the atmosphere, very fun. By the way, we weren't able to get a reservation but if you go to the first seating at 6 they can easily accommodate you.",

She had a great time at the STK in New York a couple weeks ago and wanted to check out this one.   Maybe I'm just getting old but I hated it overall. Music was so loud I could barely hear my friend right next to me and couldn't hear a word our server said. I get that they're going for a fun atmosphere, but it's a restaurant not a club. I go to nice overpriced dinners to enjoy my friends company, not listen to blasting hip hop and the drunk douchebags next to me.   Petite filet, mac & cheese and corn pudding (creamed corn) were good, but not exceptional - you can get the exact same meal at any steakhouse in Vegas. Probably for a little less.  Cocktails were good but not worth $18-22/drink.   Avoid the foie grass French toast appetizer - love them separately but the flavors together with cooked apples is a big fail. Especially after factoring in the ridiculous $24 price tag.  Really mediocre service from the Asian dude server too - we had to ask for the wine list and saw him 4 times - took order, brought wine list, took drink orders, brought check. Not sure if there were no specials or he didn't feel like telling us. To be fair, maybe he's just accepted the fact that nobody can hear what the eff he's saying because of the music.   Mastro's next door in Crystals is so much better then this place - classy and beautiful restaurant, exceptional service and food. It's not stuffy so you can still have a good time there. But if you're wanting to be a loud obnoxious group, please go to STK where you'll fit in with the crowd.",

Filet was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the horseradish sauce.   Drinks - I am a little embarrassed to list all of the ones we tried so lets pick one ... the espresso martini (times 2) after dinner was the perfect ending to the experience and the perfect start of what was still to come!

I ordered the filet mignon. My steak came over cooked. I like mine medium. I sent it back and they brought back the SAME steak even blacker than before. I called the waiter and he said he misunderstood me. By this time I have not had a meal and my group was finished eating and the wait was on me.  Even with the inconsistencies, I was still billed full price and was never apologized to. I had to ask and point out the issues again to the waiter, and they gave me a free side. Big whoop. Still billed. I was ready to get out. I can't wait to go back to Gordon Ramsey's. Much better overall experience and food.",

    "text": "So let's start by saying the only reason for this review is because I would love to respond to a prior review of someone by the name of \"binzer\" because I know that it is not socially correct for the business to do so.    Always love when I read reviews and people criticize others but they themselves can't spell or have the basics of grammar correct.  At the same time when did everyone (especially you binzer) become a food critic and an expert in service.     You say your not a fan but you keep finding yourself going back... I say to you as you say to them that you REALLY love this place but are too big of a douche to admit it and maybe the tool yourself .   If there are 100 better options than name them.  And if the bass is loud and you are afraid of vibrating well then go back to the McDonalds that you gave 4 stars   STK has always treated me right, food is great and service is even better!!!!    Enjoy your happy meal and super size it perhaps if your feeling frisky!!!!!",

Wine list good but waiters did not know much about wine or care.  This is Vegas shuffle you through the crowd.  I must say food was great and this is a trendy place to visit.  I would recommend reservations any night except Monday or Tuesday unless there is a convention in town.  If you have a large group, try and get a dedicated room.  And, demand more than one server or you'll wait too long for service.  The steak are awesome I must admit!",

I ordered a glass of Malbec which was corked and all they did was not charge me for the glass and get me a new one. No apology from a manager or anything. On top of all this my gf and I still have stomach issues the next morning... waste of money",

Bread was brought to the table but removed before main meal.  Overall a very average dining experience with a final tab of $238.00 for two people.  You can do much better.",

I've had better, I've had worse. My scallops (the \"special\" of the day) were undercooked with a ton of sand grains in them. Unacceptable for the price. ... and for the price, I expected more of a wow factor, but must remind myself, I knew I came to an over-hyped LA joint in LV and should know what to expect by now (mild disappointment). So, if you want a hip dinner at a fun new hotel, enjoy! If you are expecting knowledgeable service with some serious cooking, try elsewhere like Nob Hill or Mastro's.",

Expected Smith & Wolensky (sp?) service since prices are as high, and it did not live up to it.. Not a great value.  Not sure how they get away with only 2 bathrooms for a restaurant its size. You could be waiting three deep for the bathroom (men & women). It just should not be the case at a place that has a $125 8oz. Kobe steak on the menu. Also after a time it gets way too loud. A place this expensive should not turn into a night club while people are still eating. Anyway not sure how long its been open but I am sure if they keep the chef and get better wait staff and figure out there portions, and mange there music volume it will be a great Vegas steak house.",

    "text": "Finally getting around to reviewing this place... Came here as part of a bachlorette party (in June!) and this place definitely set the mood. The decor is modern and very different from traditional steakhouses. The atmosphere was on the clubby side and the music was pretty loud. But from where we sat the music wasn't too bad, but we still did have to talk louder than usual.   The bread was amazing! And it was in such a cute shape. And the sides were good too. My fave were the truffle mac n cheese and the mushroom pot pie. I wish we had more of the pot pie because between 7 girls, there wasn't much to go around. =( I shared lamb chops and the beef short rib with another girl and both were really good, although I love lamb so I have to say the chops were a tad better. And I really liked my Strawberry Rhubarb Cobbler. If you thought it was my dessert, you would be wrong...it was my cocktail! And it was delicious: fruity but you could still taste the kick. It came in a martini glass rimmed w/ graham cracker crumbs. I think most of the others liked their entrees too. Unfortunately a couple of the other girls didn't like the steak they ordered. I tried a bite and agree that it was overcooked.   Our server was great and attentive at first (as most places are) but it dropped off a bit after we got our food (like many other really busy places). I knew this place was super pricey but I was disappointed that the portions were on the small side. The sides are smaller than I would have liked and the entrees i shared could have been larger as well, although we were both full at the end, so i guess you can say it was just right. I would go again if there was an occasion to, but if i wanted to have a really nice expensive meal at a steakhouse in the same price range, I'd rather go to Mastro's.",

I had the Sirloin Steak medium size since they are known for their great steaks.  All the steaks come with one side sause.  I had the peppercorn sauce.  Additional sauces are an extra charge.  I must say that the steak was really juicy and tasty.  We ordered two sides for sharing.  One was the sauteed mushrooms which was really tasty and the other one was the spinich was great as well.  The steak also comes with a few vegetables on the side which was decent.  They also give out fresh bread as an appetizer.  Luckily they ask if you want the Blue Cheese with it because the bread is really stinky with the Blue Cheese and really good without it.  So I recommend no Blue Cheese and just ask it with a side of butter.  Service was really good.  Highly recommended.",

The decor is white brick walls with outrageous decorations and a trendy purple lighting scheme, and it's a fairly dim restaurant. I felt like I stepped into a futuristic lounge. The wine selection is thorough, and the waiter was knowledgeable about each of the wines and the recommended pairing. They have a delicious appetizer cheese bread!! I wanted to scarf down a couple of loafs before the steak!  The main meal came approximately 25 minutes after ordering. The steak itself (strip steak, medium) was cooked exactly as specified, and the flavor was excellent. I decided to order it au poivre, but I think some of the steak's flavor was lost in the peppercorns. I wouldn't order it again this way. The sides come separately but I ordered the asparagus which was phenomenal.  I would give 5 stars but we were made to wait 5 minutes for a table for an unspecified reason. No one else was waiting at the reception desk and the restaurant wasn't crowded. 4 stars.",

    "text": "I've eaten here twice so far, and I really love the atmosphere if you are trying to eat a nice steakhouse type dinner, but have a club like feeling at the same time. It's a fun, cool vibe if you are having dinner or drinks with friends. The music is always on point, but extremely loud, so if you're looking for an intimate quiet date night, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. The first time I went here, the food was good and a gf and I shared the medium sized ribeye which was cooked perfectly from what I can remember. The whole group of 6 girls shared about 3 or 4 different sides which were more than enough.  The second time I went here though, the experience was not at all the same. Since we came with guys this time, I was going to share the cowboy ribeye which is on the larger side. The waitress told us it would be a bit of a wait of about 30-45 mins since the cut was thicker, but said she would tell them to rush the order so the food would come out the same time as the rest of our group. We told her we didn't mind waiting, and we understood it may take longer. The food arrived....all at the same time. Now that wouldn't be a problem normally, but when I got my steak which I ordered to be cooked medium, the inside was ok, but the outside was COMPLETELY burnt, like I mean, charcoal burnt! When we ate it, I couldn't even taste the flavor of the steak, all I could taste was charcoal...bleh! Even my friend who likes burnt food, actually couldn't take it anymore. We realized after, that they were about an hour from closing time and were rushing to get the orders out. An hour to closing when I got my food, not when I put my order in btw. I mean, if I'm going to pay $85 for the steak alone, please take your time and cook it correctly! That left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) so I probably won't be making a trip back. I did leave 3 stars since my first experience wasn't as horrible, our server was super friendly this time, and the creamed corn was REALLY good! However, for a place that specializes in steak, they need to make that their priority.",

Service Horrible... Drinks Horrible... Ambience Horrible. You sit right next to the next diners as the seats are so close that the mans arm next to me kept touching me! YUCK!   We spent over $400.00 for two dinners with two drinks each for sizzler quality steaks. The steaks had a liver taste to them and were spongy to chew. How anyone could rate this place a 5 star place is beyond me! Save your time, money and taste buds! Don't go to this place no matter what!!!!!  Eat well my friends!!!",

We made a reservation and after waiting 30 min past our reservation, we realized we were never going to be seated. Every time we asked for an update we were told, \"It will be ten more minutes.\" The hostesses were very rude. This was at 11:00 at night. People who showed up after us were seated before us. It felt like a personal attack.",

At one point the waitress got out her cell phone to help us. I understand ambiance but help your patrons out a little with some candlelight or something.  We ordered 2 filets and had to send them both back because they were raw.  Our waitress, Carmen, seemed disinterested at best.  Ordered tator tots as a side item out of curiosity.  $15 got us 9 tator tots with parmesan cheese.  9. Ordered the mashed potatoes side for $15  and it wasn't even enough for 1 person.   And $12 for 1 pat of truffle butter per steak.  That's $24 for 2 pats of butter.   Very disappointing",

Beyond the delicious entrees, fresh ingredients, and potent cocktails, the STK LV waitstaff has a knack for going above and beyond to ensure that all of their patrons are taken care of.  On multiple occasions, I've seen one of the floor managers, Zaban Furness, walk from table to table introducing himself, shaking hands with each guest at the table, and striking up brief comedic banter. Coming from someone who worked for Nordstrom for 5 years, I know very well the definition of real customer service and rapport building. Not only is Zaban and the rest of the STK staff the epitome of customer service, they are the embodiment of relationship building in the modern cuisine dining industry.",

For a restaurant that specializes in steak, we weren't expecting an overly charred piece of filet. Not for the price paid. It was apparent that some form of leadership was around since we saw people scrambling. Two many servers serving us and the consistency lacked because of it. Drinks were not refilled.

The group I was with has been there several times over the past few years--enough where the staff recognizes us.   On this past visit, the food was excellent (as always), the bartenders/host staff were great (as always), but the problem?  The DJ.  The Thursday night DJ fell short for us.  The Friday/Saturday night DJ always plays everything you want to hear and always leaves you wondering, \"Did he steal my playlist?\"    The Thursday night DJ needed a little help.  We handed her a list of 4 songs with a nice tip.  The first two requests said, \"Anything Britney and anything Michael.\"  Not to needy, right?  In the two hours we were there, we only heard 2 of 4 requests and with the second one we had to beg.  (And I mean seriously beg).  We were sweet and nice and completely reasonable, leaving a 25% tip for our servers (we had to ask them to beg too).  Note to the Thursday night DJ:  when one of your patrons has the entire upper floor clapping and cheering to her dance routines, play what she wants to hear because it's not about you.  Unfortunately, our group won't be back on a Thursday night again.",

Menu: No gluten free menu.  Few options to \"make\" gluten free.  Some servers are cool about making vegetables without sauces, steaks without sauces, but if you don't get the right server, you'll end up with my meal as the boyfriend said looked like it was from Long John Silvers. (Plain tough fish, with potato chucks. No ranch to dip)  Now that I took all the fun out of eating, this place wasn't as awesome as it used to be. It still is for the non-celiac though.

All were fantastic! Prices are a bit high but it's Vegas and the food was worth it in my opinion! Service was good as well!  The bread for the table was outstanding it almost looked like monkey bread and tastes like garlic knots!

Each time I was with a large party and we would have to scream across the table and even then we could barely hear each other or were repeating ourselves multiple times.  Other than that the customer service is phenomenal and so is are their menu items.  I really wish they offered something else with their complimentary bread other than blue cheese or just plain.  I, nor many others who I dined with, were a huge fan of blue cheese.  I ordered the same filet mignon medium rare with truffle every time.  Each time better than the last.  We decided to try every sauce they have.  All seemed a bit bland to me.  My favorite would have to be Bernaise sauce but it just wasn't as flavorful as I have had.  With my steak I either ordered shrimp or lobster.  The shrimp are abnormally large but none the less very flavorful. Our table shared a bunch of sides including creamed corn, mac and cheese, etc.  All very tasteful.  The only thing I have to say was the worse I ever tried would be the foie gras I got as an appetizer.  Not sure what flavor they were going for but the pairing was way off for my taste buds and the foie gras seemed to be cooked totally wrong.  Other than that I will definitely be back.  Stick to steak and sides and you definitely won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "So when we first arrived to Vegas my boyfriend kept saying... Boyfriend: if I do good on the tables I'm going to take you to STK! Me: What's that? Boyfriend: A steakhouse. ..get it STK...steak...isn't that cool. Me: Yes, that is so clever. Anyways it must be really expensive if you're depending on doing well on the table.   So all week he's talking about this place and loses a good chunk of money on the table the night we were supposed to go. Well I played my $10 ( im afraid to gamble), and walked away with $50! I said, \"Well it looks like I'm buying myself dinner at STK, you're not going to talk about it all week and not let me go because you're mad at your bad luck.\" Lol  It was 10:30pm and before going back to our hotel we went to the 3rd floor of Cosmo to check out STK. We heard the great music coming out of STK and they we're playing all the hip hop jams. It was the best music I heard all week ( esp since it was EDC WEEK). The hostess said they could reserve a table for 11:00pm, so we hung around since the music was good.  Atmosphere- Def looks like where all the trendy people go, Cosmo feels like that anyways. All the women were beautiful, the men dressed nice. There were a lot people hanging around the bar. Restaurant dark and music loud.   So around 11:10 we were seated and our server was pretty cool. We looked at the menu and I studied what I could get with my $50 winnings. I only went here to spend my winnings as planned.  Well after looking at the menu I saw I could get salad, dessert and maybe water for $50 lol. Most steak dishes were around $50 minimum, chicken dish around $30, all desserts $12, sides $11, side salad $13, and most appetizers and small plates close to $20. Cocktail/Drinks $15 to $30.  After some quick calculations I ordered a field green salad, an appetizer, and the sweet potato donuts. I saw that shrimp was $6 so I said,\"Can I add shrimp to my salad?\" The server then asked, how many pieces? I said,\"How many come in the $6 order?\" He said...one piece. I was like, 1 piece? What kind of prep goes into that shrimp, $36 for 6 pieces? Ok nevermind adding shrimp. The server then kept asking if I wanted a cocktail, and in my head I was like ,\"hell no\", keep the free water coming lol.  The blue cheese bread with chives was a little too strong for me, I'm not a fan of it.  My salad was ok, better than a lot of places but it needed craisins or nuts or shrimp lol...something.  My beef appetizer dish with pesto pasta was light and tasty.  The beef was sliced so thin it melted in my mouth. The sweet potato donuts were sooooo good. Definitely try those.  Sweet and fried fresh.   My poor boyfriend still had the poop face about losing $400 in 10 min, and he didn't want to try anything. He was at least trying to get into the music to feel better. A girl next to me was there for her birthday and her boyfriend ordered her every dessert on the menu. They all looked so good! Especially the skillet cookie. She actually offered me some, but I heard my boyfriend jokingly whisper...\"if you say yes and take some of her food, im gonna slap you.\" So I told her,  no thank you.  My bill came to $49 without an entree, but I was still satisfied.  I'll def come back for the full experience when we have more time and money ;).",

    "text": "I've been to STK Las Vegas several times, and it never disappoints.  Although I've heard about people having reservations and them not being honored in a timely fashion, I've personally never experienced it.  In fact, we actually had reservations for 7:30pm, we called to move it back to 8:30pm and they gladly accommodated that request.  Well, we called again to have the reservation moved back once again and that was accommodated as well, with no hesitation.  To make this short, we called again and ended up with reservations for 10:30pm.  Upon our arrival we were promptly taken to our table and the server immediately asked whose birthday it was.  I know it isn't much, but that little attention to detail from the notes in my reservation was pretty awesome.  Most places actually never catch that.  Now on to the food.  I had the 7oz Filet Mignon with Truffle butter and it was delicious.  The steak literally melted in my mouth, and the fact that I like my meat very, very well done says a lot.  Their creamy Yukon Potatoes we also on point and very tasty, however, their truffle fries were pretty bad.  That being said, the service and the rest of the food was so spectacular that I couldn't knock them any starts for their really, and I mean really bad truffle fries.  They literally tasted like they were left in oil for a couple of days.  Obviously I know that isn't the case, but nonetheless, that's what they tasted like.  The place itself is very trendy and loud.  It's my kind of place, but if being able to hold and intimate conversation is your thing, then  this probably isn't the place for you.",

Upon ordering a scotch I was rudely informed that you have to spend at least $30 in order to get a large ice cube, this was odd as most nicer bars usually throw them in no questions asked, even at a small extra charge.  As it happens my order did meet the minimum and I received a large cube, but to my surprise it was made from tap water which defeats the purpose of ordering a better ice cube in the first place.",

    "text": "My party of 4 came here for dinner and was greeted by great service. Our server was friendly, and attended to our food complaints professionally.  Bread with blue cheese sauce and chive olive oil - This was rather adventurous and I really enjoyed it since I'm a fan of blue cheese. Unfortunately, my friends didnt enjoy it quite as much :( To each its own!  Beef tartare with black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel - Love how the fragrance of the black truffle brought out the freshness of the beef. The potato chip was also very fresh. Really enjoyed this.  Pork belly with soy glaze, pickled radish and ginger - The first time this was served, the pork belly was over cooked so much that it was tough and chewy. Not great. Had to send this back. The second time was much better and more well seasoned, though still a little too tough for my liking. I'd give this a pass.  Lil BRGs (wagyu sliders) - Super good!! We didnt add truffles or foie gras, but if I had the chance to do this again, I'd definitely try adding both!  Medium Sirloin steak - The best steak of the night. Steak was beautifully cooked, soft, easily cut, and had a layer of fats making the steak not too dry. Definitely recommended.  Medium filet with foie gras topping - Steak was slightly too dry for my liking, but foie gras was beautifully cooked.   Medium Rare Filet Medallion - The first time this was served, the beef was way overcooked. It was so cooked that it tasted overly-charred, and the beef was definitely past medium rare. We had this sent back and the beef was perfectly cooked the second time round. Recommended!  Sides: Mushroom pot pie - This was yummy, but way too salty. There is no way the pot pie can be this salty. We contemplated sending this back too, but by then have given up on having our food sent back so we just ate it anyway.  Truffle fries - OMG SO GOOD. MUST ORDER. Freshly cut potato with truffles. Can't go wrong.  Mac and cheese - Decent but ok to pass.  The bill came up to be about $330 before tips, including a bottle of riesling, which is pretty OK. Ambience was nice with great music.   4 stars for food (after they finally got it right), but unfortunately having to send food back twice is unacceptable for a fine dining restaurant, hence -1 star. Thankfully, the waiter handled it professionally and made sure we were very satisfied with our food.",

Meet was not seasoned properly and spinach was bitter, I had to ask for salt for the steak so I could eat it.  I would not recommend this place.",

The only thing I don't like is they make you wait at the bar even with reservations and even when your table is ready I'm assuming so they can make extra money from drinks.   This meal will not be cheap.  $400  But it is worth it.   We ordered a delicious bottle of goldeneye wine to begin.  I've had the strawberry martini w graham cracker crust that is so yummy also.   The lamb was really good but they had a better lamb months ago.  Our waiter told us the menu changed to corporate.   So now all the stk's in the country has the same menu which is slightly disappointing.  I've been to the NYC location and didn't like it at all.   The burrata and tomato salad is a 10.   The sides are decent but for $15 each it's a little steep.  Fries should not be $15 unless they are coated in gold.    Be prepared to have a fun and expensive time there.",

Cooked perfectly with a ton of flavor. Can't go wrong with foie. There was a side of...what looked like pickled onions and chives, totally flavorless and the plate could have done without it.  - Sweet corn pudding - it reminds me of a Filipino dish that was one of my favorites as a child, Maja Blanco.

The portions were tiny, the food was extremely expensive (even for a steakhouse considering the small portions they give) and the food was decent at best. The service was great. We had a friendly waiter & everything came out quickly. I had the special which was a 7oz filet Oscar style ($77) & lobster mac & cheese ($36 for a small dish). The Oscar crab was flavorless & runny. My cousin had the steak & mashed potatoes which were runny & bland as well. I left hungry & underwhelmed. Won't be back. For the money, Capital Grill or Del Friscoe's will get my business.",

I was a little peeved with this.  After awhile, we were sat down and promptly given water and bread.  Now the bread is given out is some type of blue cheese bread and it was yummy!!!! I think they pair it with some type of chimichirri  sauce and I loved it.  Now for the main event.  I looked at the menu and was a little overwhelmed.  Luckily our waitress told us about the specials for the day.  I ordered one of the specials which was a \"Prime Rib Cap\". The other one was some type of steak with crab meat on top.  I can't eat shellfish, so I just decided on the other.  When I got the prime rib cap, I thought it was pretty good, but not for the cost.  I think it was like $55-65, but I guess I've had better steak for that price.  Along with my steak, I ordered the truffle mac and cheese.  Er man gawd, this thing was amazing and I literally had to stop myself from eating the entire thing.  Sooooo worth the extra cost to add on the truffles.  Fair warning, you might keep the entire thing for yourself.  I ordered some type of drink and totally forgot what it was.  I think it was some type of jalapeno drink from their menu and it was ok.   Just me alone, I spent over $100 without tip.  So, prepare yourself to pay some $$$ for this place.  I think there's more hype to it than it's worth.  Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but I've had better.",

The food though, especially for the price, was a huge let down. The food was extremely bland. The only way I'll believe other reviews aren't lying is if the restaurant just so happened to run out of seasonings tonight. I ordered the medium filet mignon medium rare and it was quite dry and bland. My side was the jalapeno grits... Which weren't horrible but the grits had large clumps in it and lacked jalapeno flavor. My husband ordered the aged bone strip steak which was a tad better than mine however that's not saying much. His side was the Yukon mashed potatoes and to be generous it tasted like well made boxed potatoes.  This isn't me trying to be rude, I'm just being honest when I say we were very dissatisfied that we paid $200 for such a bland tasting meal. We love food and love flavor and this just wasn't that.",

My husband and I went to celebrate my 30th birthday, I found it a bit odd that the waiter/hostess never mentioned it-radio silence. At an expensive restaurant, I would think they would be used to having people celebrate special events here. It was noted on my Open Table reservation that I was there to celebrate my 30th birthday.  Now to the food. We started out with the Oysters - they were really good. We then had the Heart of Romaine salad and it was delicious. My husband had the ribeye and I had the filet. Both were cooked to perfection. For our sides we had cream spinach and macaroni and cheese. Both were good, nothing special. NOTE: the lobster mac n cheese was $22 dollars more than regular mac n cheese $14. This blew my mind. Overall, it was good. I wouldn't go there to celebrate a special event in the future as it's not acknowledged.",

    "text": "I came here for Mother's Day with my friends and we were spoiled! We are from Hawaii and were in Vegas for a conference so we were away from our kids this Mother's Day. The staff here surprised and delighted us with free champagne, a free cheese platter, a free huge cinnamon sticky bun AND their fresh baked cookies and milk shake platter.  It was just one wow factor after the other.   We ordered the bottle of champagne with fresh juice to have mimosas. You get to choose two Flavors. We had pixie which was pineapple, guava and oj as well as the pipe cleaner which was ginger, lemon and other juices ( sorry I forgot but both were refreshing and amazing! ) my entree was the steak and eggs ( perfect) while my friends ordered the rib scramble and the frittata. All dishes were perfect!  There was live music and the atmosphere was just right. It was a cool vibe to be there and the service was amazing! You gotta check this place out for brunch, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Here's a great example of fantastic food with crappy service... the steaks we all had were fantastic and the sides were incredible. He overall food experience was excellent.   Considering the prices of this restaurant the service was subpar. Started with water and bread taking far to long, followed up with a waiter that refused to bring the drink one of my dining partners ordered (a Manhattan) telling him that he will bring him \"something he would like better\" followed up with a long wait for taking orders and another waiter override when another dining partner ordered a specific up-charge sauce and another \"I suggest and will bring this\" ... it went unused as it wasn't what he wanted.   Other little issues to many to mention but suffice to say not satisfied at this price level which we were willing to pay - but as a customer we are the ones that call the shots not an over zealous arrogant waiter!   Be prepared for about &150 per person with a drink and glass of wine -- again the food is wonderful sides are rather overpriced at $15 for a smallish serving size . But if you go have the Mushroom Pot Pie side -- excellent!",

I informed her we were having drinks at the bar downstairs (Chandelier) and if they were running behind, we can stay there until the table was ready. She assured me the table would be ready at 10:30 but the entire party would have to be there. At 10:30 I checked with her again and she said it would be an additional 25 minute wait. We were not seated until well after 11pm. Standing in heels for over 45 minutes will put any girl in a bad mood! Our server was good, the food good, the bar scene vibrant. However, with so many options, I would make reservations elsewhere next time.",

Decent food, Great atmosphere, but terribly overpriced for what you get.  47 dollars for a sirloin steak that was probably equall in taste to a steak on the chain restaurant longhorn or outback steakhouses menu. Way overpriced, but i guess thats what you get in a vegas. nothing comes with that 47 dollar steak either, everything is all a la-cart so you can rack up that bill even more. at 10+ dollars per appetizer and 10+ dollars for deserts, side salads and drinks, you will be way over 100$ per person in no time. sad because its NOT worth it, but since its in vegas and in a nice hotel, people Will pay for it.   Service was Good, but not exceptional and at that price per person, good doesnt cut it. the server didnt even read us the specials or go over the menu until we asked her too.",

For the main course I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet mignon. The steaks were quite average compared to what we have had at other steakhouses. We also had grilled asparagus and mac and cheese on the side.  Not sure what cheese they used in the mac and cheese but it was not to our liking.  But this is not your typical steakhouse as its part club/lounge and its in Vegas. So from an experience perspective STK gives you the Vegas party vibe while you dine but I would not go there if I were looking to have a great steak. Also I would not go there if you want to talk to anyone over dinner because the music is pumping. My rating is based on the food.",

    "text": "I'd give it 2.5 stars but someone needs to fix the music issue and hopefully a low side vote will encourage it.  (BTW, there is a big frackin knob for the volume. Turn it counter-clockwise)  Like many of the reviews on here, I was hoping for awesome and I got moments of cool with whole smattering of  average. I have eaten at 90% of the steakhouses here in town and I have a pretty good feel for what is hip and cool.   Ambiance- The music is WAY to frackin loud. It's bad form to have to yell at my wife who is 3 feet away from me during dinner.  I have 6000 watt home theater with 4 18 inch subs so I'm not in the \"If it's too loud your too old club\".    But for an upscale steakhouse in an amazing casino it's just amateurish. I get concepts and this one just sucks.   Nor is this the place to bring clients to discuss business. It is however a good place to bring inlaws because you won't be able to hear them.  Annoyance factor minus 2 stars  Food- We asked for a heavy peppercorn rub on our steaks so much so that the steaks would be \"ruined\" with pepper. They brought our steaks cooked perfectly to temp and with a thick coating of peppercorns.  PERFECT! I had the STK Bold Sauce and my wifey had the creamy horseradish. My sauce was good if not a bit too sweet and the horseradish cream sauce was blah.   We had the truffle fries (LOVED), Asparagus (good as it can be) and mac and cheese(Eh, cheesier and more crunch please)  If I had to find fault It would be that food came out a bit too quick. It was about 5 or so minutes after the apps were completed.   Overall N9ne, Botero and Brand have a better product.   Minus .5 stars  Staff-  The FoH girls were cute, dressed well and very friendly.  No complaints here.  Bar staff was interesting- My bartender told me her signature drink was a cucumber and basil martini. She said was it amazing and I asked, is she so sure that she will buy it if I don't like it? She said no.  Fair enough, except the bartender next to her had a group of folks come in. Couldn't tell if they were friends or business but there were 8 of them in the group and he proceeded to make them all drinks and then tell the group that the whole round was on them.  Hmmm.... I joked to my girl if I could be part of their group. She didn't get it. Oh and the cucumber martini at union is way better.   Our waiter was awesome as was the buss staff.  He was polite, fun and knowledgeable about the menu.    I probably won't be back as I'd rather go to N9ne or Botero for the same price and not have to deal with the frackin music. Plus N9ne has a cool vibe that is way more  my liking than \"Steak at the Roxbury\" feel of STK.",

    "text": "Ah STK the place to be seen and to mingle. As soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. The hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. You order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. But is it worth all the hype and the $$$?   Service - Our waitress was awesome. She was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. She was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. I was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. They also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. Side note: Just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. Tap & Sparkling do not mix well.  Food - Within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with a complimentary Parmesan Garlic Roll and it's dipping oil, which I can't remember what it was off the top of my head. The roll wasn't bad.   We order our cocktails and appetizers - Tuna Tartare & Foie Gras French Toast. Phenomenal! Both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. The Tuna Tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a taco shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. The Foie Gras French Toast was balanced excellently. The toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a poached apple made happy time in my mouth! I highly recommend these two apps.   We then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of Parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed Alaskan crab legs. The fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if I say so myself. The mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. They bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. The Alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how I miss the Northwest!   Now for the main entree- for being a steakhouse I was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. It was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! A little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. Maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. However, I'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. The waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly I wasn't impressed by them. The flavor was so bland. The mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still lacked flavor. Word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. I couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (Best Mac & Cheese: StripSteak's truffle mac & cheese).   Wait still not done! We had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole STK experience. We ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pudding. If you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. I did like the bread pudding but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in the caramel syrup. The Captain Crunch addition to the bread pudding was quite interesting.   When all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. We easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full STK experience. Overall, a cool place to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have a couple hours to kill...our dinner lasted over 2 hours.   Side notes:  The timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. I feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. The steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. Be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. Make reservations as it can get crowded.",

We walked right in and the place was busy but not packed.  The music was low, the service was friendly and our waiter Ryan Schuler was a handsome information center. As the next hour passed the room became much busier and the music volume became club loud.  I would not have minded until I heard Whitney Houston's \"How would I know\".  I might be getting older but not that old.  We dressed up a bit and felt comfortable, but we noticed a few older couples from Iowa in their sweatshirts and jeans (they stood out in not a good way).  We ordered the $40 seafood platter that had 2 oysters, 2 prawns, 2 tuna & I think yellowtail. DELICIOUS! I enjoyed a White Orchid & a Cherry Cobler drink & my honey had the Cucumber drink (reminded me of being at a spa).  We ordered the 2lb lobster ($75 MP) & I had the Filet Medallion 7oz that was wonderful at $29 & my fiance had the 10oz Filet at $44.  Each was as good as the Steakhouse at Circus Circus or SW at Wynn. We didn't even use our sauces.  A side of the maple carrots and the Yukon creamy potatoes finished the meal off for us.  We were stuffed but left happy.",

My fiance and I went to this \"restaurant\" and it was are first time at the cosmo, we were on vacation and it was her first time and mine as an adult and this was about a year ago and this encounter has bugged me ever since which is saying a lot because I never write reviews and I also never hold grudges. As interesting as the previous reviews stated is why we decided to check it out. Upon first entry NO ONE seemed happy to be there (staff that is) we were not greeted, we were asked if we had a reservation right off the bat with great attitude from the hostess (she should have started with at least Hi!). When we mention we didn't have a reservation she became even more sassy with us and stated if there is seating at the bar its first come first serve, which of  course was packed. We went back to the counter and asked if we could make a later reservation and the simply said \"no\" did't bother asking for a time or date she assumed we meant that night. We saw a few people leave and we thought we'd take one more look at the bar, followed by a rather large \"manager\" asking us if we had a reservation in a gruff and an intimidating tone in hopes to steer us away because we didn't have a reservation. With the the 10 min we were there looking for a place to sit and enjoy our night we were made to feel unimportant, unwanted, and we weren't given any respect what so ever. This place as the food may be good ( although we never go to that part, so i can't say it is or not) the customer service or lack there of has made me want to write my first review. This place needs a serious work up on staff and management, this place regardless of circumstances needs to reevaluate their support for the costumer. I will never go back to this place even if I was able to eat there for free because of their horrible staff and customer service. Needless to say our experience there was the worst I've ever encounter in my life, especially to bother me for about a year and I'm not easier angered.",

    "text": "Still a winner in my book.  There's a DJ so it's super loud in here, but sets the mood for a perfect starting point in going out in Las Vegas.    It's trendy, classy, packed, the food is great and the atmosphere is superb!  I always get the bone in filet it never disappoints. Occasionally, I'll add the foie gras topping to it which is out of this world!   The tomato and burrata starter salad is another crowd pleaser.  Brussel sprouts are surprisingly VERY good, broccolini was tasty too albeit not my absolute favorite, creamed spinach is a winner always, the blue cheese bread they serve to start is a must.  Like I stated earlier, another great place to get the party started and the food is too die for :).  ps-they also have STK's in the meat packing district & in South Beach, both of which I've been too and are equally as good.",

    "text": "This is hard for me to write! I gave STK Las Vegas 3 Stars ONLY because I'm such a huge fan of the one in LA but I have to say I was very disappointed at my dinner at this location.  My husband and I frequent the one in LA and ALWAYS receive excellent service and the food is amazing so we decided to go to the one in LV for our anniversary and were extremely disappointed.  We waited for our table for almost a 1/2 hour with reservations and that wasn't such a huge deal because the restaurant is super fun with a DJ and happy partying people from Vegas but our wait was so in vain as we were seated in the very back of the restaurant near the kitchen. Again, I wouldn't have really thought much about it but I saw the Hostess seat at least three parties that came after us at nice tables before she sat us and it felt deliberate! What is this 1959 where you seat the colored people in the back by the kitchen? I was not a happy camper but so as to not completely ruin my anniversary dinner with a big nasty attitude, I just tossed back a couple of strong drinks back and made the best of it.  I was hoping our dinner would make me forget all about the Hostess segregating us in the back but to my disappointment, the food was really just OK!  I can't imagine how the same dishes can taste so different but they paled in comparison to what we're used to savoring at the LA STK.  Lastly, they did not acknowledge the special occasion note that it was our anniversary.  My husband had to remind them but they did then bring us a pretty yummy Bread Pudding!  Would I recommend this place you ask?  Absolutely because its in the Cosmopolitan Hotel (check), plays awesome music (check), has decent drinks (check) and the food is edible.",

The DJ was one of the best DJs I've heard anywhere in a very long time (hilarious that it was... in a restaurant).  Did a wonderful job of appeasing people of all ages.   Anyways, service was excellent, wine was VERY good, and the food is always delicious.  Had a filet, mashed potatoes and spinach. Friend got the mac and cheese which was soooo much better than my spinach.  Make a reservation for sure and if you're trying to eat around prime dinner hour, be prepared to wait (even with a reservation).  If you're not up for super loud music and a party atmosphere, go earlier in the night. If you're down to get down, then go late night and have a good time!!  I'll definitely be back next time Im in Vegas.",

We had a variety of sides, including rice pudding and asparagus...I wanted to lick the bottom of the bowl- but that would have been classless and common. My companion had a porterhouse steak and refused to leave the table until the entire steak was devoured...what an epic fail that was! We definitely left with doggie bags, and attempted to solicit a wheel barrel or two.  It's extremely pricey! So be prepared to spend on average about $60 p/p without factoring in adult beverages. The sides are served family style, but it's a stretch to feed more than 2-3 ppl from the smalll side portions. This restaurant is located inside of the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel. After dinner, we had a full on photoshoot in the lobby in the Vintage telephone booth. Love love  love!",

The food here is subpar in comparison. The porterhouse was cooked well and huge, but flavor was lacking. The sides of duck fat fries, bok choy, Mac n cheese were all forgettable. The bread was good as well as my crab salad. If I had to pay for this meal, I would be very unhappy. Luckily it was comped so all is good. The vibe for younger patrons is nice though.

The bar is well staffed and courteous, and their cocktails are unique enough to be interesting.  I had the 7 oz hanger steak with the potatoes and spinach as sides.  They drench their sides with butter, which is an all too common sin in chophouses.  But this is more than made up for in their perfectly grilled steak.  I cna only imagine the huge industrial size furnace grill they have in back to serve this many steaks at this rate and at this quality.  The chefs are superb.  That being said, this is a consistently happenin' place, with a lively crowd to go with the DJ spinning tunes and the casino two escalators away.  I recommend it if you have saved up for a great night on the town.",

    "text": "Brace yourselves again for yet another long review, we ordered a lot.  I was confused when told STK was a nightclub with food. We arrived around 7 to a restaurant lounge vibe and left around 10 to loud club music and dancing around us. This place definitely changes atmosphere so pending your intention of the meal, don't expect good conversation later in the evening... it gets loud. Our server was very personable and lovely, over all wonderful experience. Perfect place to dine before heading out to dance, high energy.   PEAR & ENDIVE SALAD - 14 I'm pretty sure I got punched with a block of blue cheese, which for me was mortifying. If you're a blue cheese fan, you'll die and go to heaven with this salad... otherwise you'll just die.  ***** TUNA TARTARE - 19 My friend (and chef) was right in highly recommending this (as do I for you). A wake up call to my mediocre tuna tartare experiences. The grade of the tuna was sushi status. I can't explain how smooth, silky and fresh each bit was.   FOIE GRAS FRENCH TOAST - 24 This combo had me tilting my head but surprisingly enough, it worked. The green apple, almond brioche and sherry gastrique were a tasteful medley.   BUTTERNUT SQUASH ANGOLOTTI - 15 Great little pillows of comfort food like happiness.   COWBOY RIB STEAK 34 oz - 85 PORTERHOUSE 24 oz - 65 True to our medium rare request -- savory and seasoned minimally as a great steak should be. Fantastic. SAUCES - We chose Chimichurri & Au Poivre. The Chimichurri was my favorite but both went well with the steak. Great in complimenting but not covering its natural taste.   MARKET FISH - Market Price A trio of seafood is served with this dish - the two fish were cooked traditionally and well. But the scallop. Oh the scallop. That heavenly luscious sweet thing of a scallop. Served on a little bed of peas and bacon pieces, seared perfectly. I was made fun of for chasing a pea around for what seemed to be 5-minutes, my laughing with everyone didn't help as my fork was vibrating with giggles (stubbornness kicked in as well on getting the damn thing) .. but if you manage to cut a piece of scallop, snag a bacon and spear a pea on the same fork ... it's a magnificent thing to behold.  ***** COLORADO LAMB CHOPS - 39 Don't mind me while I sway to the now turned up club music with my lamb chop in hand. I mentally restrained myself from literally picking up the bone to attack the last few nibbles. Thank God the server took the plate away, I was growing weaker to temptation with every sip of my manhattan. Possibly my favorite lamb experience, which is huge as if I had to choose one meat for the rest of my life, it'd be lamb. Ordered and served at medium rare. Their pomegranate vinaigrette was subtle yet so perfect in bringing out hidden flavors seamlessly yet distinguishably.   ::: SIDES :::  BREAD Everyone gets this. It's smothered in cheese and to be dipped in a green sauce. Messy to eat but very good! It reminded me of an oversized muffin. A couple of us (as we had 2 loaves brought out) did get hit with the stinky sock bite due to concentrated cheese.. so be careful of the piece you grab.  SWEET CORN PUDDING I grew up loving cream of corn. This reminded me of it but way, way better. For such a simple dish, I loved it.  CREAMED SPINACH Almost a tad bit too creamed for me but the flavor was good.  CREAMY YUKON POTATOES Really great side dish to cut the meats and intense flavors.  :::ALCOHOLISM:::  MANHATTAN When you think of this drink you think of an old guy. Let's ramp it up and drop this old guy in the middle of Manhattan rush hour with this cocktail in hand trying to cross the street at a green light, no spilling. Yeah -- it's that strong and intense. And the cherry at the bottom, pretty sure it soaks up 25% of the liquor so be weary of the face you make while consuming. With that said... definitely my kind of drink.  WINE We ordered a bottle of a full bodied dry cab which blew my mind. Paired with the meats it really pulled everything together. We also ordered a delicious bottle of pinot gris for paring with the seafood. Solid wine list. You'll be happy if you're a wino here.",

Nothing in LV ever is, but I will say, it comes close! The food is what you expect from an STK, expensive but worth it for a memorable night out. The music is loud and infectious.

    "text": "Let's talk about the big sirloin, seafood platter, drinks and dessert. It's been a week to this day that I got the pleasure of trying out this contemporary restaurant w/in house dj.  The music was so loud you could barely hold a conversation unless you were two inches apart, which I think is a little on purpose.  ;)...but enjoying such good food, who would mind?!  In fact, I was enjoying it all so much, I should've had my own table.  All I can say is, that was one of the plumpest, juciest meats i've ever had.  My friend ordered a scotch whiskey to accompany it. Not a bad choice and his wife, venison chops, which were delish. I started with the pear/endive/arugala salad/walnuts/blue cheese crumbles ...very light and tasty followed by a shared plate of carpaccio, which I had heard of..maybe 6 years ago.  Very tasty with the pesto pasta..don't have it any other way!  The Seafood Platter for $40 which included: 2 oysters/ 2 pickled shrimp with jalapenos and red peppers/ alaskan king crab/ 1/4 maine lobster.  It came with the horseradish and usual side sauces but there was another with a little vinegar..you hardly tasted it (and i'm not sure what else was in it) to add a little flavor.  I made the right decision there, as I was trying to keep my dinner as 'natural' as possible..just adding a little kick to it.  I enjoyed my main meal, which is more of an appetizer for me, with a rum/basil/cucumber cocktail.  I could not have been offered a better suggestion.  The dessert was a berry mousse.  Topping it all off with a glass of champagne. One of the best meals of my life. I could not even fathom tainting all the good flavors in my mouth by touching the parmesan truffle fries, which I hear...are the rage. I can't wait to go back, even if it's by myself, at own little table. The pleasure will be all mine.",

The place is very much a scene, but they don't deliver on the food.  we started with the foie gras french toast which was pretty good. i had the NY Strip which i ordered medium rare, it came out med+.  no biggie, if the steak is good, it will stand up to being overcooked.  now i said 'if' and this one did not qualify.  It was under seasoned and really lacked any intense beef flavor.  I'm assuming that at the prices they charge, that the beef was dry aged, but it really didn't taste like it had been.  very lame for a $50 steak.  the wine list was horrifically overpriced, even by vegas standards. we had a bottle of Justin Cabernet which is about $25 retail...it was $100.  4x retail is just absurd.  Basically, go if you are into the scene and the ambiance and don't mind overpaying for a sub par meal.  If you are looking for a great steak, there are a ton of other options!",

Donovan's, Ruth Chris, Morton's, Maestro's...i would never wait more than a few minutes before a waiter or waitress would introduce herself.  Service is terrible Extremely disappointed. There are better steakhouses. Try Joe's. Service was wonderful.  Steak was incredible. We ate there at the same time of night as we tried to eat at STK.",

Was told over the phone that they don't accept reservations for party of one's so it's my own fault and I should have known. But I figured that was just for reservations and if I showed up they would seat me like usual. WRONG. I was told by the host they they have no tables that seat 1 (obviously, I could have taken a two or four seat table but I guess that's not policy at this location) instead I was told I could sit at the bar. I reluctantly agreed, again - my fault. But I was hungry and love STK so there you go. Service was fine, food was good but being told I HAD to sit at the bar and couldn't get a table just didn't sit well with me. Perhaps whoever reads this for the company will review this policy and realize it's wrong to treat guests like that. After all, I paid full price. There was no discount even though I could not enjoy a full experience. If you're dining alone, I suggest you pick somewhere else.",

They also bring out a small pot of bread for each person, which was tasty and cute. Service was very good and the waitress even bought us a round of shots because it was a bachelorette party, plus I think she thought the group was a bit too quiet for what we were celebrating lol. I would love to come here again and try the other steaks and entrees.  Tip: If you're driving here, park in the East garage because it'll be a shorter walk to the restaurant.",

But the talk is not just talk; the talk is all True.  We ordered a little bit of everything as all foodies do, in attempt to reveal the man behind the curtain (or kitchen) and see if the popular restaurant was what it was all cracked up to be. The steak was amazing; the chicken was delicious, but my ultimate favorite were the donuts. I have not, I repeat, HAVE NOT had any dessert quite like it. I actually have foodie remorse that I didn't eat dessert for dinner...hey, when in Vegas!   The Brussel sprouts were not my favorite rendition of this beloved veggie, but they were still better than I expected. If you're looking for a few sides, feel free to pass on that one.   But our server Collin and now favorite Las Vegas person alive, really set our experience over the top. I've never had a fun, talkative, experienced and attentive server like him before--anywhere. If every server were like him, every restaurant would be enticing.   Until next time STK; your donuts will be in my dreams.",

    "text": "I dined at STK a couple years back, and I remember thinking, it was just OK. It was on my birthday and I enjoyed the company and celebration. I didn't let it bother me. When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not?  Either I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!?  My boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert.  First, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that.  They staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me.   Another downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic.   I get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy.  Vegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God.   Overall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys.  However, Vegas has a place for everyone, this is just not mine.",

We were hooked up with a private room, so we didn't have a problem with sound level. You can actually adjust the music volume and the brighness. BTW, the music was a really good mix.  The service was really excellent. Our busser was in very frequently and our waiters checked-in very often as well.  Now to the food:  I got the 34 oz Cowboy Ribeye with Fois gras topping. Maybe it was a mistake getting such a gigantic cut of meat, but what's done is done. The steak has some black char surrounding it. This is very different from any other steak house that I have been to. The char wasn't my favorite but for the larger cuts it does help break up the soft texture of the meat. THe body of the meat was perfectly medium-rare served with two side sauces (one sweeter, one more savory). THe fois gras was delicious and is a DEFINITE must-do, you can't get fois gas in California!  So yes the steak was great, but the char brought it down. Fois gras topping was excellent. Private-room made it very comfortable, but I don't think I would have liked it in the main areas. Service was excellent for the private room. Bathroom was crazy small, single stall!  I would probably give closer to a 4, but some unusual things (the super char and the bathroom) brought it down for me.",

I've been to other steak houses that claim to be sexy, modern, different, but they usually fall flat or are underwhelming. STK was quite the opposite. It was a Sunday night, granted we were in Vegas, the dj was spinning and it was clear that despite our late reservation of 9:00pm, the party wasn't over. The stage is set, great vibe immediately and as if the environment wasn't already perfect, our fantastic server, Jill lights up our table with her smile. Not only does this girl know her menu, but her service is efficient, her timing is impeccable, and her recommendations were on point. I started with the Kale salad, the exact light, refreshing predecessor my steak and potatoes entree needed, more props Jill. And the addition of truffle butter, again Jill's recommendation,  didn't feel like an upsell because she talked foodie to me and, duh, won my heart through my stomach. The final taste? Donuts. Mother-f***ing donuts. I love donuts, Jill loves donuts, cue angelic choir, naturally we order donuts. The menu description doesn't do it justice, \"STK Donuts\"? What they should call them is 'perfect bites of heaven.' Crisp, lightly fried on the outside, delicious, melt in your mouth warm pastry on the inside, glazed with maple and candied pecans for a sweet and savory firework in your mouth. Yeah, they were good. Jill sensed it as the food coma started to induce, and knowing we intended to rally after dinner, she brought over two espresso shots. I don't recall the name, but they were also a digestivo. BAM, we were back in  the game to party all night. I'll be visiting STK every Vegas trip I have.",

It was my first time dining at STK and we came in for restaurant week. $80 for a three course meal was a deal I could not surpass. The food was delicious and service was only okay. I found my server to be rude at times, particularly when questioned about menu items, but the other staff members were very friendly and helpful in any way possible. As for the food, we had the dayboat scallops with Osetra caviar, sirloin steak topped with king crab oscar and then strawberries and cream and doughnuts with a glass of champagne. I loved every bite of what we had, but it was what ensued that was regrettable. We came down with food poisoning about an hour after the meal and it was horrific. It honestly looked like the scene out of Bridesmaids and has been this way for over 24 hours. I have tried calling the restaurant to speak to a manager and have been told several times that the managers are unavailable and will try to get back to me in the next 3-5 days. For a $250 tab, I expect to enjoy my meal once instead of having to suffer through it a second time. This is absolutely unacceptable coming from a restaurant of this caliber and I shall be taking my business elsewhere.",

    "text": "A friend and I came here about a week ago for a nice evening out on the town!  Our server, Paul, hands down made our experience.  If we had anyone else it wouldn't have been the same.  I work in F&B and would hire him in a heart beat!  We started off with a nice bottle of Chardonnay.  We were given the bread which had a nice bleu cheese spread on it, not too much, just right!  This came with some oil for dipping.  We also had the beef tartar & borracha salad.  The cheese on the salad was to die for.  The beef tartar was good but not the best I've ever had.  The server did inform me that the Carpaccio is a better choice but I don't like Carpaccio's as much.  We then had our entree's.  I tried the special which was a 7oz filet w/ crab & asparagus.  It was prepared to my liking, medium rare and the flavor was excellent.  I also got a side of bearnaise.  My company got the fish on the menu which she loved.  We shared the truffle mac and cheese which was top notch as well.  Paul was very attentive during the entire meal.  He asked for our names and addressed us by them during the meal.  He was an honest server and didn't just say that everything was great however when he knew of a similar but better dish he offered that which is a wonderful quality.  We finished with the donuts which was a recommendation from the server.  I 100% will dine again at STK and ask for Paul.  Even overhearing the server at the table next to us their experience was so different.    The environment is ambient and perfect for any special occasion or just a business dinner.  The only thing I disliked was that there was a bathroom attendant.  Being a female I don't really care for you to stand there and open the door to the restroom for me.  I expect that in a nightclub but not in a restaurant.",

Love it )   Our waitress was nice , attentive , she made our dinner perfect !   Restaurant is gorgeous ! Lil bit high volume music ! But it was fun for us !   I order dozen oyster , 2 order $90 ? Big Rib eye ( it was perfect for 5 girls )  Mac n cheese , mushroom soup , mushpotato , asparagus , and bottle of wine .....   Total was lil over $400 ???? So we paid like $100 each .   Maybe expensive ! But we had fun experience so we are very happy ! And definitely I will be back when I have a special occasion !",

Mario, the Busser was amazing as well. We asked for wet towels after eating our seafood platter and he went above and beyond to squeeze lemon juice in our hands and serve us fresh hot towels . Amazing service , overall !",

Overall menu items are enticing with some good variety. We had the ceviche to start, fell short of what we expected not enough lime, I guess we just grew up with a more sour-tasting ceviche. Followed it up with a 10oz filet paired with a Malbec which were amazing. Wine was just right, the steak was cooked perfectly at medium temp. Tons of flavor, tender and we both chose truffle butter and chimichurri on the side which complimented the steaks well. We added some mashed potatoes and asparagus on side which were just as great. Service was very good, really appreciated that - great conversations and timely check-ins.",

But I really can't say anything bad about my experiences! STK is on this level as well.  I got this amazing cauliflower au gratin - heaven!! And the mushroom pot pie was so big - I could have eaten just that. It was just so rich and delicious. Who would expect that from a steakhouse, huh?! And I just had to get those sweet potato donuts to go - that's the main reason I came! I swear to a higher power - those are the best donuts I've ever tried in my life. So fluffy and sweet. Uggghhhh I am craving them now, just thinking about it.   This place is worth the high price. Oh, and the waiter was knowledgable and friendly as well. And bonus - at least at the time we came - it was hardly noisy at all. Lovin' it!!  Oh and when I was starving I had some of the steak and fries leftovers of the friends we went with - also equally amazing. Oh yeah, and the bread and oil they served beforehand was also tasty - but had a tad too much oil for me.",

For a dinner for two we payed $300+ which is ok for a fine dining restaurant but the food should be impeccable.  I got the lobster $150 it was alright.... it's stuffed with salmon that was way too salty. Mac n cheese was cool.. and then the grits? Green grits, weird.. tasted more like a weird mash potato definitely not grits . What killed it for me was that they only have 2 restrooms one for males one for females.. if I'm paying all this money for dinner I should not be standing 10 minutes waiting for another person to come out especially because if I'm at a fine dining restaurant I'm probably wearing expensive heels ( uncomfortable ).  On my way out the restroom the restroom guy shouts out dayumm girl, you looking good tonight.. I'm from the hood I'm used to that but not at a fine dining restaurant.  What killed it ultimately was the waiter !! He had a attitude when we left! We tipped $60 is that not enough? Too many good restaurants in Vegas I will not be back",

We asked for seconds to take home too. :p   We ordered..  6oz Filet Medallion $41 -perfectly cooked to medium rare! I added truffle butter ($12) and seared foie gras ($18) to it too. -oh gluttony!   20oz Bone in Rib Steak $57 -perfectly cooked to medium, topped with caramelized jalapeno onions ($6) and seared foie gras ($18).   ..and our sides $13/each   Mac n Cheese -good, made with ditalini shaped pasta on a cast iron skillet. Came out super cheesy and bubbling! (they had a lobster mac n cheese special too)  Parmesan Truffle Fries -soo disappointing. They looked so crispy..appealing..but nope, when I took a bite, it was like biting into an undercooked baked potato. It was extremely dense and lacked any seasoning. I didn't taste the truffle either! :(   Mushroom Pot Pie -the concept was cool but the puff pastry on top didn't do much for the dish. The mushrooms were perfectly cooked in a nice, creamy sauce.   Jalapeno Cheddar Grits -extremely green, jalapeno flavored and cheeeesy!   We skipped out on the appetizers since we had so many sides. I do want to try the crispy lobster tails, hamachi crudo and seared foie gras next time around!  BF loves this place and wants to go back on his trip next month.

I LOVE THIS PLACE and plan on going every time I'm in LV.  I ordered a fillet medallion 7oz and it was the best fillet I've ever had. Also ordered the dungeness crab salad which was so damn delicious. The  BF and I wanted to kill the chief for being able to create such a great damn crab salad.   The drinks  were great. Our waitress was so nice, super fun and very helpful.",

I don't know how to describe it other than it was just perfect!  Oh, let me back up - the bread they give you before your meal was declious topped with melted blue cheese paired with truffle oil and chive.  OMG, I would have pick that little cup up and take a shot of it.  Must have the mac and cheese and mushroom pot pie, oh man..OOo and the creamed spinach.   I was in heaven.  I wish I had room for dessert but by the end of the meal, I was already in food coma and couldn't wake up from it. Maybe next time.  STK, Thank you.  I can't wait to visit you again.",

    "text": "I had a dinner meeting that I didn't have to pay for, so we tried to reserve Gordon Ramsey and they were booked, so we decided to try STK as my experience at eateries in Cosmo has been good so far.  The decor is modern, hip, a little loud, not as bad as Nine or Switch, but a bit loud for my taste.  I don't think there was a single female employee there who didn't have fake tits.  It must be a prerequisite for working there, and overt tatoos are probably a plus for them, neither of which I care for very much.  I had 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell which turned out to be kushi oysters from BC.  Oysters in May?  Is Alex S losing his frigging mind?!  No.    Oysters actually taste the best in Spring time.  All of the snow melt bring rich minerals from the mountains/forests into the ocean where they get fat and plump before the breeding season in the summer.  Don't eat oysters in months that don't contain \"R\"?? completely bogus, but I'd probably avoid July/August after breeding season, but as many of the oyster farms grow triploid oysters that don't breed, that's becoming irrelevant these days as well.     I actually liked the fact that they had sauces off to the side so that I could choose what to put on my oysters, as I like them plain or with lemon at most.  They were good oysters.    I had bone-in rib eye and it was solid.  Very well executed as I expected from a good steak restaurant.    Overally, I didn't care for fake tits, tatoos and loudish environment, but I believe that their food is solid.  It's even nicer that I didn't have to pay for it, and I don't mind going back there at all.  However, does it stand out among many great steak places in this town?? Not particularly, but the food was good and I can't complain.",

I didn't have a dinner reservation, but I don't think that should be an excuse for my unpleasant experience. I took important clients there to enjoy the fine dining they have to offer.  Usually I receive a well mannered and qualified service to match the high priced dining.  Instead we were rushed to finish our meals and the meal quality wasn't the same as with my past experiences.  All my courses came out too quick.  The service was very fast paced, which is not the norm for $125 dollar per person.  Fine dining at that price usually allows you to enjoy your meal with adequate time and patient professional waiters to attend you. Instead I received fast food delivery and fast food waiters at my service. It was extremely unpleasant, unenjoyable, and unacceptable for \"fine dining\".",

While waiting for our table, we started off for drinks at the bar and the bartender was incredible! He made the best drinks and I guess he overheard us talking about how we were celebrating my birthday so he made us a round of blueberry kamikaze shots on the house. Seriously...one of the best shooters I've ever tasted! Amazing!   We were then seated and although the server took a bit long to welcome us, he made up for it through the night. I think his name was Collin? Definitely request him, if you can!   I got the seared tuna and usually tuna can be dry even if it gets just a bit overcooked but this tuna was perfection! One of the best tuna dishes I've ever had! Can't really comment on everyone else's dishes but they look yummy and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  Overall we had 3 rounds of drinks at the bar, 2 bottles of wine, 4 entrees, and 1 side dish between 4 people. Luckily, it was my bday dinner so I didn't take a look at the bill but I wouldn't hesitate at all to come here again!  The vibe of the restaurant was so fun too! I've been to many steakhouses, even a few Michelin awarded ones but they're usually dreary. STK was so fun though! The music was great and honestly, every table looked like they were having a blast! Good drinks, good food, good music, good company...what more can you ask for?!",

Our large group had reservations for an early dinner, and it didn't take long to get a table.  If you have an option, sit in the elevated level with booth tables.  It is more private, and not down in the noisy bar level.   The wine by the glass list is tiny, with only one Pinot Noir option (wait, this is a steak place?).  Not very many beers on tap either, and those in the bottle were not impressive.   I ordered the small filet medallion medium.  It came out very WELL done, and dry.  At this point it had been over an hour and I was starving so I just ate it and didn't say anything.  Even the blue cheese butter couldn't save the meat.  My co-workers bone-in ribeye was decent so I would say go for that. Sides are served family style, and each side could serve 2 to 3 people.  The parmesan truffle fries were a winner, crisp and flavorful.  The creamed spinach was ok, but not as good as other steak houses.  The sweet corn pudding was more gravy with little bits of corn occasionally.  Rudy's BBQ in TX could teach this place a thing or two about corn.   Food was WAY overpriced for the level of quality and service.",

More importantly it is a good value, especially for Las Vegas.  I had a group of 4 we need some apps, each had a steak, shared a few sides and had 2 drinks each and dessert.

As for the food, AMAZING.  Bone in rib eye is a must..and since I live in California..the best part is you can top add a nice piece of foie gras on top of your steak...along with some truffle butter if you really want to splurge!  Also get the lobster risotto with white truffle shavings while you can for a side!  Corn pudding is amazing here too.  For dessert, captain crunch bread pudding!! what more can you ask for!!

We got to our table right away and were greeted by our waiter, Teddy.  Teddy KILLED the presentation and specials for the evening.  I think that our entire group was sold from the minute that we sat down. the place was hoppin.  The environment was like a party without any sort of craziness.   As for the food, I had the wedge salad.  It had huge chunks of bleu cheese and bacon along with these funky pickled tomatoes.  It was really good.   I then went with the 16oz sirloin with shitake mushrooms on top.  I love red meat and this thing was massive!!  I felt like John Candy in \"Great Outdoors\" eating the Ole '96er.  Although I didnt finish the steak, i enjoyed every single bite. As for the sides...we went with the truffle fries, mac/cheese, yukon potatoes and the sweet corn pudding.  I would have licked the bowl of the pudding, if allowed. Man, it was good. After dinner, everyone was stuffed until Teddy introduced dessert.  Ok, get this...Sweet Potato doughnuts with maple glaze and crumbled walnuts.  I'm a foodie, and these were the most ridiculously good doughnuts we all ever had.   Our bill for 8 with wine and cocktails AND gratuity came out to about $100 a person.  To me, that's a splurge but my wife and I would spend it again in a minute.   There are a lot of fine restaurants in Vegas.  STK on an all around perspective could not have been a better dining experience for us.",

Atlas, there's a steakhouse that has a more feminine feel. The dining room is very dim, and has a very sexy style. My only complaint was that some of the tables are too tight. The table next to ours had three large men with round bellies who had a difficult time squeezing into the booth-like table. Actually, another gripe I had was that the A/C was blasting, but the temperature at night was in the 50s. Apparently, the casino controls the temperature, so dress accordingly.  Now, the food was exquisite! I had been eyeing Lil BRG for several years. They were everything I had dreamed of and then some. My husband ordered the short rib and I selected the filet mignon. Both were seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Usually steakhouses give you a steak knife; instead we only had butter knives. Our steaks were so tender that a steak knife was not necessary. Our sides included creamy Yukon potatoes and a mushroom pot pie. Both sides were out of this world! As a rule of thumb, I always order dessert, but we were too stuffed. The entire meal came to $160 (no alcohol) which is a bargain on the Strip.",

For main course we got the demarco (sp?) Steak, short rib, grilled salmon, porterhouse and platter of Mac and cheeses. The steaks were very solid. They got mixed up unfortunately and some were clearly better than others which were sort of dry. Overall the food was very well done and I would recommend.

Cosmopolitan  First of all this place has hands down an amazing DJ (October month) who plays really good R&B, 90s and all the new stuff of course. Yet jam after jam this DJ was able to mix and pick the best beats! Thank you so much since our table was right next to the DJ set.  Right when you walk into STK you get a super neat vibe with the bar in front. They seat you and start you off with an amazing garlic chimichurri dipped monkey bread (savory)!!!   What did we order? We all started with the Filet Medallion and I added a shrimp because surf and turf?  Then you choose two sauces. The chimichurri sauce was my favorite.   We all shared some sides including the yukon potatoes, jalapeno grits, asparagus, and broccolini. The sides were alright could be a little more tender. The steak was really good though! Oh also cannot forget we ordered the millionaire's chocolate bar...so good with all that texture!  Overall check this place out for the vibe, and music from DJ! The next time I visit I'd try the roasted dover sole.  And if you wanted to know my friend got married to the love of her life!!!",

Our server, Edward gave us great service and good recommendation. Initially, I want to order filet medallion but end up going with wagyu flat iron.  Here is our order:  Wagyu Flat iron with truffle butter-omgerd! This was excellent! I couldn't complain about anything!!! Very flavorful and tasty.   Bone in filet-hubby's order. He says it was \"pretty good for what it is.\"   Amazing bread with chimichurri sauce- Great start! We are foodies and it was fucking delicious. It taste like the outside of a flaky pate chaud.   Parmesan truffle fries- so good! We will never eat plain fries again.   Complimentary dessert-we came as a congratulations to my husband's job promotion. I'm not sure what the dessert consist of but there was a macaron (taste like lavender and blueberries or fruit loops) with whip cream, piece of chocolate and some other stuff in a glass jar. It was so good.   I want to note, I've been to STK in Ibiza and it is comparable! I'm definitely looking forward to trying all the STKs! The music played a role in our dining experience and took it to another level! I absolutely love this place and would recommend it to anyone!",

The beef tartare and ceaser salad was good, Th Lobster mac and cheese was really good but it didn't have much lobster. Ordered the Ribeye and it was incredible and yummy.

It was also close to medium for a $70 steak in Las Vegas.  Bacon-wrapped Scallops ($25 - 2 stars) Dry-overcooked bacon overwhelmed the large scallops and underwhelmed my wife and me.  Fresh Pull-apart Bread (Complimentary - 4 stars) Blue Cheese Butter and Chive Oil plus the fun of tearing off a piece from the muffin-size bread make this food more interesting than not ... and it's free.  Grilled Asparagus ($15 - 3 stars) If average was a flavor, then the asparagus at STK was full of flavor.  Cream Corn ($17 - 2 stars) This side was recommended by the server. I would not recommend it to you because it was too much cream and not enough corn.  Cucumber Stiletto Cocktail ($19 - 4 stars) My wife liked this STK martini with Grey Goose Citron Vodka and St. Germain Liqueur although I thought it needed more vodka and less cucumber.  Gin it to Me Baby Cocktail ($19 - 3 stars) Botanist Gin was the star of this drink heavy on raspberry & lemon. I switched to Hendricks Gin & Tonic ($17 - 4 stars) for the last couple rounds.  The service at STK was like the food ... hit & miss. Our server was cool (& hot), but I had two long spells with empty cocktail glasses ... sigh.  Overall, we should of just come for drinks and to hang-out at the hip & busy bar because dinner at STK was just A-OK.",

My girlfriend got the dry-aged delmonico ($78) and I ordered the dry-aged bone in strip ($80). We also shared two sides: tater tots and mashed potatoes.  We waited an hour before receiving our meal. Tables adjacent to us arrived 20 minutes after us and got their food well before us. During our 50 minute wait our server didn't check in with us until about 10 minutes prior to the arrival of our meal.   I will say our steaks were very good. But both our potatoes and tots were bland and disappointing. The most exciting moment of the evening was the earthquake.",

The DJ played 80's music when we were there on a Sat night and we were all dancing in our seats. Everyone is looking good and you feel the euphoria and decide it only makes sense to give them half of your paycheck.... I will be back when sugar daddy is flipping the bills :))",

The music is fantastic if you are at a dance club, but you will come out of the restaurant with your ears ringing.  You cannot have a conversation with your dining party.  The food?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it was so loud the server got one of the orders wrong.  I have had bone-in filet at other restaurants and this one did not come close in size or flavor.  Not great.  The fois gras was virtually raw.  The best thing was the pear and endive salad.  Very upset that the server said the salad portions were single serving.  So we ordered one each per person and one salad could easily feed two people.  She was padding the bill.  And she didn't want to take the incorrect order back.  The place was packed on a Wednesday night, but I would never go back.",

I will get to the point, here is what we had.  To start out, we had the truffle butter fries, which was excellent, the texture and taste was memorable.  Next we had the foie gras french toast with slices of apples, which too was excellent, all the flavors together made it a memorable experience.  Now for the main course, I had a bone in rib eye with truffle butter and foie gras on top of the steak.  I got it medium, I usually do medium rare, but I decided medium that night.  The quality of the steak wasn't what I expected.  I was definitely expecting more from at top notch steak house.  The steak tasted dry and was overcooked.  Adding the foie gras and truffle butter really enhanced the flavor, but couldn't help a dry piece of meat.  My other buddies got theirs medium rare and they said the steak was a little dry, not as dry as mine, but dry.  Service was ok, took a long time to get the food out, the Maitre de was rude and shouldn't judge people by how they're dressed.  If you want to eat at a good restaurant, more often than not, they do have money.  BTW, I was wearing a casual button down and shorts.",

Found on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is the steakhouse to be scene at. The vibe definitely matches the hotel being swanky and trendy. The service was attentive and good for a steakhouse. The food - overall a good meal and price was reasonable for a steakhouse. Appetizers and salads - they are big on blue cheese here so if you are not a fan (like me) make sure that you ask that they do not include it on your dish. The bread and dip they give you is great (the bread has a blue cheese butter, but you can't taste it so I was ok with it - the dip is some herb based olive oil and it was phenomenal). The steaks - bone-in rib eye medium rare is excellent and pair it with the foie gras - definitely a luxurious meal with all that rich fattiness. This is definitely a steakhouse to come to celebrate a birthday or just hang out with some friends - I would not say its for a romantic date since the do play music (fairly loudly) and the crowd itself is extremely lively.",

The arugula pear salad was perfect to split and well balanced with fruit, nuts, and balsamic dressing. The lobster cocktail was tiny but super fresh and served with a great cocktail sauce. The cowboy steak was large enough for three (yes three) people to split with a side of mushrooms - delectable. And the truffle fries were perfect. A bottle of Faust and our meal was complete. A great place for a fun night out with an amazing meal. Can't wait to return!",

Pumping with club beats and complete with a boozed up bachelorette crew, the scene was definitively Vegas. I was brought back to home when the fresh skillet of bread with side of chive olive oil arrived. I kept it simple and ordered the hamachi, the pear salad with endive, and beef tartare with black truffles to start. Delivered, as usual. I finished it up with the organic chicken breast and a side of asparagus. Skipping the dessert was hard to do, but satisfaction has to end somewhere! I highly recommend STK in Vegas, and a big thank you to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FVegasGoodBuys.com&s=368404fe8d26a141f48e006cd46aa16f9acd50c445bc51ff365a61f304e4e3cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">VegasGoodBuys.com</a> for always leading me in the right direction for anything Vegas!",

The food was good, but I was not wowed by anything. It is really about the atmoshere I guess. I read someone called it an assembly line, and that it is. The only thing that I did not like was the server. She was efficient, but REALLY snooty. Give me a break, that is barely tolerable at stuffy French restaurants. Secondly, after we finished eating she told us we had to move to the bar to have more drinks. We weren't allowed to sit at the table and finish our champagne either. So, we just left and went somewhere else to spend our money. (chandelier bar) I guess when you are this popular you don't care about this. But the novelty always wears off! Not sure if I would go back. I did enjoy the music and people watching. I don't like being asked to move before I'm ready. We were on a comp which normally gets better service too.

We arrived at the bar to have a drink and maybe an app before we went to a lounge at another hotel. He promptly greeted us with a wine list and a smile. Unlike all the other Vegas bartenders who are too concerned about their eyebrows or their pending American Idol audition, Michael actually cared about which glass of wine we ordered and didn't try to convince us to get the over-oaked California cab du jour that the management was pushing. So we sat down and decided to get cozy. After perusing the menu for a minute, we told Michael to pick out some of his favorites. The secret is... the people that work there always know what's best. We're hungry. While we waited, Michael introduced us to some of the other bar staff and guests. While we ate yummy, warm blue cheese bread we talked to young, sexy people, listened to fun music and ordered more drinks.  The food arrives. Carnivore heaven. The centerpiece was a bone-in ribeye, sliced to share. Side of bearnaise. Parmeasan fries. Spiced carrots? Who would have thought spiced carrots? Utterly, ridiculously good. Everything was SO good.  Only problem was that there wasn't MORE.  No dessert, just more drinks. Come here if you like to have fun and have a good time. You just might like it. Michael and the bar staff were amazing, unforgettable. Thank you. Can't wait to come back. Cigarette please.",

Hostesses, waitress, bus boys, food runners were all really nice and good at their jobs. Food was fine-- like all steak houses. The wine list? Maybe the shortest and most over-priced I've ever seen. They had, maybe 12 Cabernet's. Total. They ranged in price from ~$90 on the low end to $1,000+. Really? I'm used to seeing 12 pages of literally hundreds of Cab's at most steak houses, rather than 12 total. So weird and out of character for a high end steak house. The desserts were just so so, btw. Steaks and sauces were outstanding! I thought the music was great.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Las Vegas from Miami and can honestly say this is the best restaurant Las Vegas has to offer. The seafood is fresh, specialty cocktails are made with care & the steaks are cooked to perfection!   There is a DJ right by the bar and it really adds to the great atmosphere. I have (almost ) tried everything on the menu and can happily recommend:   Tuna Tartar: Highest grade of tuna Seafood Platter: Freshest ever! Coming from Miami I am a seafood snob and this platter always surpasses my expectations!  Dover Sole: The brown butter sauce is A+++ Bone-In Filet: Lean yet flavorful Truffle Fries: Thick cut so different from other restaurants  Lobster Mashed Potatoes: Self explanatory as to why these are a must Sweet Potato Donuts: Made fresh and melt in your mouth :)    What really makes STK stand out from most restaurants is that the management touches base with the tables. For such a busy restaurant to do this is nothing short of amazing and such attention to detail is what keeps me coming back for more.   Throw on a cute dress, grab your girlfriends (or significant other) and treat yourself to a night at STK. Order the Cucumber Stiletto, people watch, and enjoy a filet; you'll thank me later!",

We ordered a nice bottle of red. I've ordered the same bottle many times when dining out and the price per bottle here seemed excessively high compared to other fine dining restaurants.   The service was great!  The atmosphere was fun & energetic. They have a DJ playing all the best jams. It was a great experience all together. Never been to a fine dining establishment and have a DJ playing booty shaking music before. It was a blast!",

We chose STK as it was close to our hotel. We arrived at 5:30pm but we told that the restaurant didn't open until 6:00pm so we waited outside for 30min until it opened. At 6:00pm, the doors opened and we were seated promptly. Our server was amazing and made dining here a great experience! The house bread was so delicious - it was served warm and I loved the drizzled blue cheese topping! Seriously - so good!! I ordered the blue iceberg salad which was good but my friend ordered the chopped veggie sale which looked amazing! For the main, we both ordered skirt steak which was so tender and cooked perfectly. On the side, we ordered the truffle fries which were good but I wouldn't order them again. We didn't order dessert because we were too full but I'd definitely come back to try other things on the menu.",

Making a reservation here was a bit difficult as I understand it, but we had a nice big table for the 7 of us. Service is definitely slow, though. I don't think our waiter came over to greet us let alone find out if we wanted alcohol, water, or anything for a good 15- 20 minutes. If this were my parents' dinner, they'd have walked out. But we were slightly more patient, instead asking the bus boy to bring us water. A few of the other girls had time to go to the bar and order cocktails and seat themselves again before our waiter decided to come on over.   Food wise, we shared a variety of appetizers. The scallops were yummy, but the toast they sat on was soggy. The carpaccio was very yummy. The burrata salad was nice, but super salty. Entree wise, I had the sole and it was nice with a light sauce and capers. I also sampled the sea bass, which I actually thought tasted a lot better, though. And the steak was sort of this sad hunk of meat on a plate with no sauce to finish it or any garnish. I realize veggies come on the side, but couldn't they make the steak at least look appetizing?   All in all, the food was nice but it wasn't amazing. And the service was just slow. If I can walk to the bar across the room, order a drink and get it before a waiter decides to even check on us, that's not a good sign. I do recommend the people watching, though.",

Mushrooms were a bit dry, seasoning was really good. Very classy mac n cheese, but kind of dry. Lastly, the jalapeno grits might have been sitting out for too long because it was room temperature. Luckily, what I really liked about this experience was the star of the show, the porterhouse steak which was delicious beyond words. Seasoning was done just right, medium well, it was juicy and melt in your mouth good. I was extremely impressed with this Omaha based steak and I can proudly say I've eaten Omaha steaks in Omaha! This steak was done perfectly, I couldn't have added one thing to make it better.  Seating is a little tight, I felt like the atmosphere was too intimate, we were sitting so close to other tables. It is loud inside also, nevertheless, very friendly staff, professional and on top of everything. I liked the overall experience and wouldn't mind coming back here again!",

Sides (ala carte) weren't anything special, but were ok Cauliflower gratin and Brussels sprouts. I wouldn't order the sides again though.   This is a LOUD restaurant so beware if you're looking for a quiet intimate setting because they play music reasonably loud.   Finally, it's Vegas so it's gonna be expensive. You're looking at $200-$300+ for two people easily, especially if you drink. Two dirty martinis were $41, dinner with two additional drinks, two sides, two salads and two steaks was an additional $269.00 before tip. All in all it was around $350 for dinner and drinks.",

    "text": "Ever trip the hubby and I take to Vegas we like to try at least one really expensive steakhouse restaurant and have a nice romantic night out. I should have listened to my husband when he said he hasn't heard the greatest things about this place (we have an STK in Washington, DC). But the reviews were higher at this location, so I thought it was good to go. I called a couple of days in advance and made a reservation. When we arrived the hostess had our reservation, but she said they needed a minute before we could be seated. This place was pretty packed on a Thursday night, and there was really nowhere to sit. So we kind of had to stand around. We also had to wait 10 minutes or so before we were seated, which I didn't think it was cool--since we made a reservation. We were seated in the lower bar area-- which again was a disappointment since we made a reservation --I really wanted to sit up stairs in the less crowded seating area. But I didn't make a fuss and we sat in the lower area. The water waiters served us water a few moments after we were seated. After 5 minutes or so of patiently waiting we finally received our waiter who gave us an overview of the menu. He explained things that were off of the menu, and I was really intrigued about the lobster macaroni. He gave us a few more minutes to look over the menu. Finally when he came back we placed our order. The hubby and I ordered a steak, lamb chops, asparagus, the lobster mac and cheese, and a side of crab legs. After we ordered the hubby and I noticed everyone had bread while they waited and we didn't -- and we had been seated at least 30 minutes or so. We finally tracked down our waiter and I asked him do we receive bread? He said oh yea and it would be out shortly. About another 5 minutes later we finally received the house bread. The bread was ok, but it tastes even better without the cheese and garlic they put on top --- you can request it without the cheese and we did. So how was the food?  1. My husband thought his steak was pretty good but he said he has had better-- I wasn't impressed by his steak but I'm the seafood lady not the steak lady.   2. My lamb chops were amazing!! Very well prepared! My chops were so good my hubby took a break from his steak and finished my plate.   3. The asparagus was ah ok.. We like are asparagus soft and not crunchy and they could have used more time in the steamer-- in our opinion.   4. The lobster mac and cheese was ok. I wasn't really impressed-- this dish also really pissed me off when we got the bill because it was $30 dollars!! My waiter didn't explain the price of this and if I had known this side dish was going to be so much, we would have left it in the kitchen.   5. The side of crab legs were delicious! I really enjoyed! --worth $30 dollars  The vibe in here is more New Yorkish-- as in really loud and seats close together.. I think they are going for a club/restaurant vibe... The female DJ they had was on point, I have to give them props for hiring her. With the service, the wait, and the surprise pricing of food- I left with a full belly but a little annoyed about this place.",

The one flaw was that our drinks did not come at the same time and my water wasn't refilled until our entrees came. For appetizers we ordered the beef carpaccio, and the burrata salad they were both to die for. I ordered the filet medallion with foie gras on top DELICIOUS!!! For sides green beens are a must along with the potatoes and mac cheese. Our waiter was great we asked him to deliver a desert that said, \"Congratulations on your engagement\" because my brother and his girl he brought along wanted to prank our mother. So our waiter was great and basically just the best. I hope I will be back soon!!",

Maybe I was too distracted by the music and atmosphere to notice the service but I have been there many   I LOVE the bread, some of the best bread I've ever had, served in a cast iron skillet and it makes my mouth water thinking about this, with the chive oil dipping sauce too, omg. Skirt steak is good. Foie gras, is some of the best I've ever had. The pies I think there is chicken and mushroom are both good but on the rich side. Creamed corn is incredible! Yum, mashed potatoes are good.  On a side note I came back recently and it's really loud in there, but I like that they have a DJ also the steak and lobster was OK, not that great. The sides and small dishes are better. I wouldn't recommend the entrees here.   Foie Gras best I've ever had.",

The atmosphere is trendy and upbeat, so if you're looking for a quiet cozy atmosphere this probably isn't the place for you. We started with cocktails which were delicious, I had the strawberry crush and it had the perfect mix of fresh muddled strawberry and alcohol with a graham cracker rim. My husband and his friend had the stk mules which were spot on, and another friend had the ginger mojito, also fabulous. They did forget our appetizer, but as soon as the waiter realized he instantly apologized and brought it out on the house- the crispy lobster tails, which we were glad we didn't miss out on! I had a filet with the red wine sauce, and it was perfectly cooked and very, very flavorful. My husband and his friend had the rib eye, and he thought the flavor was up there with the best he has had! Another friend had the chicken as well which looked fabulous. We all shared the truffle Parmesan fries, Mac and cheese, and corn hash and it was the perfect complement to our meals in the perfect serving size. They brought out shots for us all and dessert on the house as well for my husband's birthday, which really impressed me. We all shared the bananas foster cheesecake- a perfect ending to a perfect meal. Our waiter and busboy and the staff were all phenomenal the entire evening. I would absolutely come here again!",

This is a lounge/club that serves steak. The music is club level loud and never stops. If you're in the mood (which I was) it's great. As we waiting for my table we drank and danced.   But, you can't really have a conversation, so if you're looking for initmate, avoid at all costs. If you're looking to warm-up before the club, this is perfect.

The music was a bit loud but they were playing all the old hits so it was like fine dining in a club.  Even the bathroom had a staff person who offered all the toiletries and then some.  There was a line for the bathrooms, only one per gender.  Luckily there were more stalls outside of the restaurant.  The steaks were tender and cooked the way we ordered them.  The dipping sauces were a nice addition.  All of the side dishes were great to share and they had a good variety.  The mac n cheese sampler was probably my fav.  If you're coming here to celebrate a special occasion, be sure to let your server know and they will end your meal with a special treat.  We got a cup of fruit with a light whipped cream topped with a macaroon.  It was definitely a nice, happy ending.  Drinks are a bit pricy here.  We ordered 3 mixed drinks while we waited for our table and that bill alone came out to $60.  I'd definitely eat here again but maybe after some pre-drinking elsewhere.",

We can tell he was a tad annoyed because attitude changed when we told him we were in no hurry and we wanted to take our time. It was clear to us he wanted to turn tables.

The Colorado lamb has just the amount of fat, lam from Australia and New Zealand are way too gammy for my taste. We finished it all with warm bread pudding!   The environment is young and very cool.

    "text": "This is the place to go to if you're looking for a steakhouse that isn't stuffy, conservative, or quiet. Other places around town try to pull off the same \"cool kid\" vibe but, unlike those spots, STK has some great food. I've heard from others how loud it can get, but we dined on a Tuesday night and, while it was busy, the music was at a decent volume -- low enough that we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. I was hoping to sit in the main dining area where they have nothing but booths, but we were seated in front of the bar in a loungey-type area with mostly 2- and 4-tops.  The bleu butter bread that they start you out with was warm, fresh, and delicious. The half-dozen Kusshi oysters ($18) we had next were mild, meaty, and excellent. The pea agnolotti ($15) had an overpowering pea taste and, unfortunately, not enough of the goat cheese or pistachios that accompanied it.   The final appetizer we had was their tuna tartare ($19). Sure, it's a common dish found in almost every restaurant these days, but their version is very good. Fresh chunks of tuna were sitting in a corn tuille, which added a bit of sweetness to the dish and a crunchy texture. The avocado cream under the tuille had cayenne pepper (I think?) that added a kick.  My wife has been eating less and less lately, so we split the 14 oz. bone-in filet ($52). Wow! You had me at \"bone-in\"... drool-worthy, nom-worthy... hell, it's even sponge-worthy. One of the most tender and amazing filets I've had. We got the blue butter sauce with it, but really there was no need to put anything else on the steak.  We got a side of haricot vert ($10) -- or green beans as ordinary folk like me call it -- that was tasty and firm. Not the slightest bit overcooked or soggy. The portions are large, so plan on sharing among three or four.  Service was a bit spotty. Our waiter was nice enough, but he had at least six tables and was constantly running around. Meaning we didn't see him often. We sat around for almost half an hour before ordering our food. A little help for the wait staff might not be a bad idea.  For all you Top Chef fans, Stephen Hopcraft (formerly of Michael Mina's Seablue) is the executive chef. But, whether you're a fan of the show or not, the bone-in filet is reason enough to stop by.  4.5 Stars",

    "text": "So, Saturday night in Las Vegas and I got reservations at STK, which I made 2 months ago for the girlfriend and myself. We arrive early for our reservation, 7pm, 15 minutes early. We had a 7:15pm time reserved. Here's where it gets good, as we check in with the hostess, we are promptly told by the young lady at the host stand after we check in that my reservation isn't till 9:30pm. So I reply, no my reservation is at 7:15pm and further more, a member of your staff called me at 11am today to confirm it. So then the young lady reply's, well we have you for a 9:30pm reservation. Again I reply abut my reservation at 7:15pm and the follow-up call. The hostess then replies that I made my reservation on Open Table and not directly from STK, and that there system shows a 9:30pm reservation. So, since I save everything, I pulled out my I Phone to prove that here is the confirmation email of 7:15pm to her and the gentleman who was standing there the entire time supporting this young ladies goof up. After looking at my email she relied, \"Oh\" and said please have a seat at the bar while we \"find\" you a table. Not sorry, or I made a mistake and we apologize for the error. Sorry young lady, I've worked in upscale dining while an undergrad during college, the Ritz Carlton, and I know how the game is played with slipping the host a $20-$50 for a table even though one doesn't have a reservation. So after this exchange at the host podium, we went to the bar for 2 strawberry mojito's. Very good, even for $18. As we are finishing the cocktails, another hostess finds us to seat us. Still within the 7:15-7:25pm range. Good to go. Out server, Paul, was right there. Very informative and friendly. So we first ordered 2 more mojito's. When they came and we tasted them, ouch, they didn't taste close to what they tasted like at the bar. We called Paul over to tell him how bad the mojito's tastes and that they taste nothing like the 2 we just had at the bar. Paul stated that the way the mojito's where made was the correct way to make the mojito's and that what was made at the bar, with Bacardi rum, was wrong. So there's no consistency in the process to make mojito's at STK, although STK is charging a premium price? Anyway, Paul made it right and had the same bartender we had made initially make a new mojito. For dinner, the food was good, except for the creamed spinach which was bland. I'll stick with a 2 because of Paul being good with service after the mojito exchange, and the steaks, 2 filets, were very good. Can't say I'll be back after this though. I like to know that when I make a reservation, and it's confirmed the same day on the actual reservation date by the restaurant, that I know I'll be greeted with respect. There are too many steak places in Vegas to tolerate behaviors like STK hostess.",

There was a miscommunication on the time of our reservation but the staff worked with us and we ended up waiting 15 minutes while they figured it out - no big deal there.  The waiter was top notch, enthusiastic and engaging - charged my phone for me too. The vibe is very loud, if you're looking for a great steak dinner in a formal environment this isn't it. What this is, is an upbeat, club-like dinner. The music was great, the decor is awesome and overall the experience is very unique.  The food though left a bit to be desired. The filet I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The sides though were where the star falls off. We ordered a wide array and nothing really stood out. The mac and cheese was adequate, the broccolini was pretty tasty, the fries I had an issue with the texture while the seasoning was good, overall it was lackluster though.  Regardless of the sides letting me down, I would definitely come back. The experience epitomizes Vegas and the scene itself is well worth a visit.",

    "text": "I'm going to bottom line this and then do the review. Will I go back? No. But that's mostly because this place isn't for me. This is a place for someone looking to drop some serious coin on a very good (maybe even great) dinner before heading out to the club. Being as I haven't been to a club in this millennium, and driving house music isn't my bag, I won't be back. That's not to say that this is a bad restaurant - it's just not for me.  Now, as for the review.  Well - the only way for me to review this place is to tell a quick story. My wife and I stopped by looking for a nice dinner before heading out for a show. We were suited/dressed up, and quickly realized we were well overdressed, despite what the prices on the menu would seem to hint in regards to dress.  We were seated at a booth/table combo with the booth facing out to the restaurant and the chair facing the wall. I, being the gentlemen (on occasion, really), let my wife have the view of the restaurant while I chose the view of her. And that was the defining decision of the night.  Unbeknownst to us at the time we were seated next to the rejected cast of the Jersey Shore. Or at the very least the mother/daughter combo. Thick Jersey accent, drunk, and full of drama. The daughter went on for a good 15 minutes about how awesome it was that I let my wife have the view of the restaurant and what a gentleman I was. The mother didn't say much - I'm assuming she was simply too drunk to communicate. The daughter was interrupted by the brother coming in (for apparently the third time) to start an argument with the mother/daughter about the fact that they needed to leave and he was tired of waiting. He came back once more during dinner to do the same. And having to watch them eat (they were seated right next to us, so you couldn't avoid it) was both comical and disgusting at the same time.  Fortunately they left before our appetizers arrived. The waitstaff, who really should have thrown them out, made it up to my wife and I with champagne. Fortunately, I'm a man that can be plied with free alcohol. The little adventure gave us a great rapport with the waitstaff. They took great care of us for the remainder of the night.  As for the food, we started with the foie gras French toast and the shrimp \"rice krispy treat\", which was really a bisque with toasted rice. The bisque was fantastic with just a bit of a spice to it. The foie gras French toast was very good, but the bread was a bit thick, which overpowered the foie gras.  For dinner my wife went for the filet (peppercorn crusted), and I did the ribeye with the same preparation. We both went rare. The filet was perfectly done. The ribeye, well, it was bordering on medium. When the server came back over to ask how everything was, the fact that I didn't immediately say \"it's great!\" let her know something was wrong. She immediately scooped up the plate, apologized, and had the kitchen fire a new one. The second one came out cooked perfectly. In fact, when they came out with the second steak they brought out a new thing of potatoes, which was our side. I give them full props for fixing the mistake instantly.  As I mentioned at the beginning, I don't think I'll go back. That has more to do with the music/atmosphere than with the Jersey Shore rejects. If you're looking for a club dinner before a club outing, stop by. If you're looking for a reserved steak dinner, this is absolutely *not* the place to go.",

I had the 13oz Skirt Steak with bacon butter which I highly recommended. Others in my group order filets and bone in rib eyes and all were more than satisfied with their meals. For dessert I would encourage you to save room, so that you can sample the deliciousness of the sweet potato doughnuts! They were out of this world good!   So if your in the dessert and have some money left over from the tables definitely try STK at the Cosmo I doubt you'll be disappointed!",

The place was fairly empty when we went but got a hard time initially about switching to a more comfortable table/booth. The service was terrible. Our waitress didnt smile once or ask how we were. i felt like she did not even know the menu. It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. I tried to joke around a bit to lighten her mood but she just stared at me with a deer in the headlights look.  The food was good, no complaints there really but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left like judging us or something, not one said good bye. Really awkward experience. I will never be back. If I am going to spend that kind of $ I will go somewhere more welcoming. We are well dressed (suit/dresses) and always tip at least 20% if not more. We were treated like we were not welcome and the staff seemed miserable.  If you want to go to a place with better service check out N9NE Steakhouse at Palms, Mortons off Flamingo Road or Gordon Ramsays in Paris Hotel/Casino.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am not a big steak eater. I don't usually order steak unless I have a mad craving AND I am super hungry (because I generally have a smallish appetite).   But when we decided to go for a nice dinner in Vegas for a friend's birthday, I made sure that my appetite was ready for some STK.  I was not disappointed. They offer several portion sizes for all appetites. I ordered the small skirt steak with (upon recommendation for Yelpers) with the truffle butter topping.  Whoa. Who thought they one little slab of butter could open up a whole set up tastebuds that I never knew existed!   Between the 4 of us, we shared four sides (Mac and cheese, Yukon whipped potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and creamed spinach). All decent accompaniments for our steaks. But I def think we could have gotten away with only 3 as we were so full even from our steaks!  Tip:  Brussels sprouts and whipped potatoes brushed in your truffle butter drippings...do it.  The ambiance has a cool vibe...dark room, live dj. The best part - the music is awesome! We were there on a Saturday night and he played all 80s and 90s old skool hits! It was like a mini karaoke sesh with our dinner.  The downside to STK: it's not cheap...but then again, good quality food is priceless. And hello - it IS Vegas. Also, we were so full fr dinner we didn't have room for dessert which looked amazing.  I will def prepare myself to go again and this time, save room for dessert!",

Cause they are all here.    Be sure to bring your wallet, an empty stomach (awesome portions), and a drink tolerance because you will be swept away by culinary amazingness.  The music in background is so lively.    Definitely don't blow all your cash on tables before coming here. This place is so worth it. Buddy and I dropped $200 each and didn't even think twice about it cause it was so worth it.    A very wise tip!!! Definitely get a reservation, this place is the place to go and everyone wants to get in. Plan ahead....and then enjoy!!!  Cheers!",

Our sever did an excellent job until she became enamored with a table of slightly tipsy businessmen - potential big tippers. Then, she forgot to give us our credit card back!

    "text": "Went here for dinner on 3/7 Friday as a party for 3.  We called our host that day to help make reservations.  She said that this restaurant was pretty hard to get into, but was able to get us in at 5:30pm.  We arrived and found the restaurant at 25% capacity, but that changed to about 75% by the time we left.  Great experience over all. Ambiance:  Great modern steakhouse decor.  Lighting was initially bright when we arrived, but got dimmer as the night wore on.  There was louder music than expected at a steakhouse, but it must be part of the vibe that they are aiming for.  No kids were there (unlike strip house at PH).  We were seated in the center of the restaurant in a serpentine-like booth. Unique set up that could still put you right up against another party.  We were seated next to a party of 2 and we had plenty of room.   Service:  I thought it was really good.  OUr server came right away and was very friendly and attentive throughout.  Water, bread, food, etc. all came out at a decent pace.  She seemed to have pretty good knowledge about the menu and made decent recommendations.   Food:  The menu was decent in offerings, not too big or expansive.  They had a variety of different items.  Bread was good and had a nice tasty blue cheese butter on top.  Also went well with the chive oil.  I ordered a customized \"surf n' turf\" with Alaskan crab and the loin steak (medium rare).  Actually came out different than I envisioned it (I thought it would be crab legs next to my steak) and was lumps of crab on top of the steak.  Either way, it was really good. I was a tad pessimistic about \"Loin steak\" but couldn't imagine finishing a rib eye.  So I was very surprised with the flavor of the loin.  The sides of Lobster mac n' cheese, asparagus, and fries were also decent.  Highlight of the meal was the Kobe Wagyu.  We ordered 5 oz (pretty damn pricey, think it was around $40/oz) and it was awesome.  Like eating butter...Dessert of ice cream was also good.  We had a great time and the food was good.  They didn't have as many choices of meat quality that they did at CUT.  I would still return if given the opportunity.",

At times I could not here my girlfriend who was right next to me. If I sent the steak back I thought I may never see it again!  We ordered two entrees, a couple of appetizers and a salad. We split a bone in filet and our guests split a ribeye. We all shared the appetizers which were good. We ordered a bottle of Cab. Wine list ridiculously over priced. $50 bottle of wine at home $160 there. Total bill $600. Anyway, we really wanted to enjoy the place but the DJ was blasting the music so loud it killed our enjoyment. My suggestion would be to lower the music so people can talk during dinner hours and at 9 when they convert to a club, blast it all you want.",

First of all the lady in the front was very nice to accommodate us even though we didn't have a reservation. It was very sincere for her to do that for us. We walked in and we were already enjoying the music they were playing with their Very own DJ. I was already feeling this place already. We had to wait for about 15 minutes at the bar. We ordered a cocktail which cost about $20. It was a strawberry daiquiri with graham powder around the brim of the glass.   We finally sat down in our table, with a good view of the restuarant. Our server was really nice and recommended a lot of delicious food.   Our list of orders we had: 1. Truffle fries-8/10- good portion and very crispy for about $13 2. Beef carpaccio pasta-8/10-very thin slices of beef with a slight amount of pasta. Decent taste of the flavor. 3. Foie gras-10/10- super delicious and I recommend. All he flavors balance so well and it was my first time trying it. 4. Oyster 1/2 dozen-8/10-very small but super fresh and well worth it. 5. Steak 20oz-10/10- never had a delicious steak ever since I came to this place. Very juicy and easy sliced.  6. Wild mushroom-9/10-big portion, good side with your steak.  If you are willing to spend a lot for a good dinner, come to STK. not really a fancy place to dress nice for. just be decent when coming here. I would come back again for any other occasion. You won't be disappointed coming here.",

Burrata cheese plate and kale salad for appetizers.   Then we split 24 ounce porterhouse and a 7 oz filet.  All the food was excellent.  The cheese was great.  Had chimichuri sauce on side for steak which was excellent as well.  Had old fashions, bottle of wine, and espressos.  Service was great.    Prices were similar to other top steakhouses in vegas.  Definitely one of the top 5 steakhouses in vegas",

My boyfriend and I ordered our steaks medium well and when we cut into them they were still bloody. We told our waitress and they brought back the steaks well done. Very disappointing that we paid $55 for each steak to get cooked twice.  The sides were mediocre at best. We've been to several other higher end steakhouses and have never had such a disappointing experience.   Even though we experienced more negative than positive, I'm leaving 2 stars because the service was good and the bread with blue butter was enjoyable.",

    "text": "In Vegas for some R&R with my wife and we were looking for a great steak place for Saturday night's dinner. We were staying at Aria, and STK is in Cosmo (not even a 5 min walk)....so we decided to give it a try! We showed up at 8:50pm for our 9pm reservation. The hostess welcomed us in and said they'd be with us in just a minute,  but didn't get seated until 9:40pm which was a little frustrating and we were seated right near the bar. Not the best location, however our server was super friendly, and attentive throughout the meal. We ordered a Hearts if Romaine (a Caesar salad) and a Blue Icewedge to start and they both showed up quickly with STK's signature Blue Cheese bread with chive oil (2 DIE 4!). The wedge was excellent, but the Caesar was almost tasteless and watery. The server sincerely apologized, but our food was coming out so he just comped the salad.  I had the Hangar Steak and my wife the 6oz Filet.  Both were cooked and seasoned to perfection and super flavorful!  We also got the Mac & Cheese and Creamed Spinach for sides.  The Mac & Cheese was ooey & gooey with a great crunchy topping. The spinach was meh....nothing special and not very flavorful.  Overall, I would say it was a good meal...not great. While there were some really great elements, and the music was awesome, STK had too many misses to make it a truly memorable meal.",

    "text": "i have been to a lot of steak house in las vegas, i think STK is the WORST, Was there last night for a christmas dinner. Not with the ambiance, not with the service but with the FOOD. As consider as one of the high end steak house in town i expect good taste and amout of food. First noticing the couple on the next table they got big lobster it looks amazing so i told myself  gonna have that. to summarize it my husband drinks when it was serve theres a small white thing floating on it, we were like what the heck is that, so we call the waiter and change it and get him another drink. I think every restaurant especially if its located in one of the high end hotel cleanliness of the plate, utensils, napkin, FOOD & DRINKS is very important. So my husband ask the waiter about the lobster if its good amout the waiter say YES named PAUL, as it was stated in the menu its \"MP\"(market price) so we ordered small amount of steak and lobster, it took almost an hour to serve our food and when it arrived it was a dissapointment. it is a small amout of steak (which is given) and a small Out of the shell OBERCOOKED lobster. So my husband call the waiter PAUL and ask him why we got a small lobster as it was stated in the menu markwt price and normally in a restaurant when u say market price they will automatically give you a big portion of it and the most expensive, so the waiter paul explained the one that we saw was a main entry and it cost like $125 and we were like we dont care paying! anyway then when he left i realized its our mistake too i told my huaband well maybe beacuse it just only a topping so i think that side i will take the resposibility for that, but the waiter should explain to us clearly as we already asked what kind of lobster we want as we already make an interest in the lobster on the next table, he didnt even ask us if we want that!!!! ok tasting the food now i was telling myself i hope it was taste good atleast. Like what i said the lobster looks very dry and overcooked and the steak is SUPER SALTY, i was telling my husband this is a mistake i didnt even finished my food i just ask my husband if you want more you can have mine, i didnt even ordef for another drink as im not satisfied with the food i ordered. Then he gave us 2 free desserts a chocolate fudge with vanilla ice cream on top which is not bad but didnt had much as im not in the mood to eat their food, the other dessert is a doughnut with glazed something which is not good. At the end of thw night we still give a 10% tip which they dont deserve as the reataurant didnt meet my expectation. SO I WONT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT AS THE FOOD IS NOT GOOD AT ALL...if you want to find a good steak in las vegas go to CUT@palazzo, MICHAELS @southpoint, STRIP STEAK @mandalaybay or just go to LAVO or ZUMA OR NOBU if you want a good food. AVOID STK @cosmopolitan X gh",

So it was all the employees plus one and here is the thing about big groups it means crappy food right ? Wrong! STK did a great job and the food was bomb. All of the appetizers were delicious we had salad, shrimp, sliders and then for dinner I had the stake with potatoes and macaroni and cheese so delicious. The most impressive part was that there were so many of us but that didn't affect the quality of the food which is a huge deal for me.",

Service was very attentive and the servers were ever present yet not annoying.   We shared crab cakes, chicken skewers, crostini, and seafood platters to start. After the kale salad with crispy quinoa, I delved into the 7oz. ribeye with lobster tail. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium. It was tender and minimally seasoned, allowing the natural flavor and juices to really shine. This was accompanied by a few sides that we shared - mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and green beans - none of which were particularly memorable. Clearly their focus is on the entrees.  The salted caramel budino was huge, too large for me to finish after my meal but it was topped with cookie crumbles and whipped cream, making the few bites that I was able to take delightful.  Down the hallway to the restrooms is a guy manning a table full of bathroom essentials. Again, one more odd thing but I guess this is Vegas.",

The ambiance is beautiful - its so chic and trendy with fantastic music and service. It truly combines fine dining with high energy lounge/nightlife. This is the perfect scene for a group of friends or couples.   Our group had a reservation, and we were seated on a Thursday night as soon as we arrived. For food, all of the steaks, toppings, & sauces were incredible - I highly encourage you to ask your waiter for recommendations on what to pair together. For sides, the Lobster Mac & Cheese and Creamed Spinach were my favorites, but all of them were very tasty.   It's obviously very pricey, but the food, cocktails, and experience are all worth it. Given you're in Vegas, go big or go home! Highly recommend.",

Like why not go to some other places like a hotel instead of a restaurant lol  Anyways....  Out of all the things we ordered I loved the foi gras, wild mushrooms and the steak the most!!! The fries is also great!!! The foie gras is cooked to perfection and so is the steak!! The beed carpaccio is usually my favorite but not from this place.   The customer service was also great!!!

We went basic and ordered a cheap red wine, Some basic science truffle fries and broccoli knee and a bone in filet and a bone in New York. The truffle fries were somewhat like something I get from red Robin, not good and I would not recommend them fat and not cooked enough. Broccoli knee was trenched in some kind of oil sauce not good as well. The bone in New York was fantastic, the bone in filet I had to send back because of the gristle and fat. They did bring me a 6 ounce filet which was delicious. Just an OK experience and I give him credit for the service and the redo..

It is probably one of the places I for sure will put on a black dress and heels for. It is similar to Mastro's but more pop and trendy and louder.   For drinks, I always get the strawberry cobbler. It is very sweet and they make the drink pretty strong which I like.   For appetizers, we ordered the lil brgs and added foie gras, it was good nothing to die for and kind of pricy ($35) for two sliders. We also got the yellowtail crudo which I didn't like at all, the sashimi didn't taste fresh. But we did get the beet salad which was great and refreshing!    For entrees, I ordered the dry aged Del Monico 14 oz in medium plus between medium rare and medium) with chimichurri sauce and my boyfriend and I split it and it was great. My boyfriend thought it was too red still but I enjoyed it. I liked the steak a lot because I personally love fatty parts of the steak but if you're not a fan of fat I wouldn't suggest getting it. We also got a side dish of the lobster Mac and cheese which was probably our favorite part of the meal.   Our waitress and service was great! I would come back on a special occasion.",

One of the best I've ever had, it was rich with a lemon sauce and the meringue on top was a nice touch.  The drinks I ordered were also very good.   Now for the negatives: I ordered a bone in filet, medium rare.  It came out closer to medium and was dry and severely under seasoned.  I've been to a dozen or so steakhouses in Vegas and this was probably near or at the bottom.  It wasn't terrible, but I've had much better.  Also ordered the creamed corn and it wasn't what I was expecting; more of a corn pudding than your traditional creamed corn.    Overall, I wouldn't recommend STK as a steakhouse, but I'd definitely go back for just drinks and dessert",

Having been to ruth cris as well as Mj's steakhouse and many others in various large cities..   Being a las vegas local, doing a staycation for my 30th birthday. We decided to go try out a new steak house! The photos on yelp looked fantastic, and the atmosphere was very cool!! So thats why it gets 1 star. But the steak...... never have i ever had to send a steak back at a top dollar steak house. My wife and i both got a dry very bland tasting steak. Rven the one that was cooked correctly was still very bland.. Honestly the spinach had no flavor, the mac and cheese was pretty good.. but this was the worst steak I've ever had. I will never recommend or come back. $300 for honestly an applebees quality steak.. skip this place.   We also were seated in a large row of seats for a big party and then they attempted to sit another couple right next to us.. when there were tons of open seats at that time. Made it very awkward and we had to complain and then got moved. Overall crappy experience!",

I normally don't really eat red meat but I ate 4 of their delicious sliders over the day! Juicy, with onions and veggies and a delicious dressing! They also had some bomb lobster skewers with an amazing sweet drizzle. There were mushroom skewers, lamb chops, cucumber veggie cups, tuna tartare... the food just kept coming during the day. This whole Rebecca made us feel so welcome. From beginning to end she was an amazing host, friendly and even gave us an awesome shirt and water bottle to take home. No shortage of food and hospitality, good job by STK.",

    "text": "Mother: One person who does the work of 20 for free...  I brought my mom to STK for Mother's Day. If my mom wants filet mignon then we are getting her filet mignon. I heard STK knows steak so it was only the best for my mom. Funny, I know nothing about steak because I don't eat it, but I was glad to see they had other choices on the menu for me. When I first made my reservation the host asked if I had any food allergies which I do. I didn't even need to tell my waiter when I arrived. He already knew and was ready to fend off any items on the menu with ingredients I couldn't have! Finally a restaurant not trying to kill me!   I must say STK knows how to start things off right!  They began our meal with their complimentary famous STK Popover bread. It was fluffy, super soft inside and most importantly delicious! I mean bread and butter is never a bad thing but this one was extra delicious.  The bread was dripping with butter, blue cheese, and chive oil...it was pretty incredible!   For my main meal I ordered jalapeno cheddar grits and the Kale salad. The Kale salad had organic red quinoa, cranberries, and apples. It tasted basic but just like a salad so I how could I complain? On the other hand, the jalapeno cheddar grits were Aaaamazing! They tasted like polenta with a twist. Highly recommend! I wanted the Mushroom Pot Pie but my waiter informed me I couldn't order it because of my food allergies. My body is always getting in the way of good things. As for my mom, she's no fool. She got what STK is known for...filet Mignon with a side of the creamy Yukon potatoes. She loves mashed potatoes and I couldn't help but notice her scraping her bowl clean.   Normally I would have got dessert but I didn't see anything too appealing so I decided to save all my calories for the buffet in the morning. However restraining from dessert ever is tough enough.   Overall what made this place 5 stars for me was our waiter. I'm so mad I forgot his name. He was so nice and attentive. He even cut my mom's steak for her, like in little pieces, like she was a kid. She loves being babied and that's ok it was Mother's Day. It really made me happy how well they took care of her! Thank you STK... see you next time I'm in Sin City!",

Loud music, packed peoples parties were blocking the walkway as we were taken to our table. Others dancing in the isles. I know its Vegas but if I wanted to go to a club, I would. We thought we came in for a nice dinner.   Our waiter seemed nice. He took our orders right away and first asked if we had been there before. Since we had never been there before he gave us some recommendations, which I love, when waiter do that.   We ordered some 16oz rib eye steaks, with truffle butter, broccolini, mashed potatoes, asparagus and a glass of Merlot.   Complementary garlic butter freshly baked bread was served at the beginning. It was amazing soft inside and crusty on the outside. Although good, I was saving my petite for the steak and wine.   Once we got our steak it was AMAZING!!! Cooked medium and oh so good! Every bite was so soft, juicy and it practically melted in your mouth good! $ 70.00 for a rib eye bone in steak alone, I would order it again and again. The broccolini and the asparagus was simply prepared, roasted with garlic and butter. Simple and delicious, with a bite just like I like my veggies. The mashed potatoes on the other hand had no texture to them whatsoever; I would have rather had anything else and at $15.00 for a side of mashed potatoes, we should have ordered something else. We ended up leaving those there. What a waste.   At the end, our total was a little over $600 for our dinner. Although a bit steep but my steak was sooo good, the best thing from that dinner! Next time I'll go in just for the steak.",

My takeaways are this: loud (but really good) music, dark lighting, crowded, average service, average meal for a LOT of dollars.  Highlight was the spontaneous restaurant singalong to an 80s anthem.  Side dish recommendations from server fell flat - 'uhhhh, I guess I always like mashed potatoes with steak'.  Bone in Ribeye was unevenly cooked and served on a giant plate that allowed it slide around on as it was served. I think I almost lost it as the server set it down. Mashed potatoes, despite their unenthusiastic recommendation, we wonderful. The garlic sauce with the complimentary bread basket was tasty, and unusual. I know I tried more dishes, but I can't remember if that tells you something. Definitely disappointing and with so many other restaurants around to blow my mind I won't be back.",

    "text": "I was very fortunate to be invited to join some of my company's best and brightest for an evening at STK, and to get to try so many items.  We got some mixed results overall both on the food and the service. Our waiter disappeared for long stretches of time, but to his credit always had a sense of humor and personality and he would own up to the fact that he was gone too long. Great that he's self aware but I know that the other guests I was with were not as patient as I was.  For the sides: Overall you come to steakhouses for the sides, right? I'll immediately call out that the tuna tartare was by far the best I've ever had. The. Best. Delightfully bright with some heat and textural complexity as well. Very cool!  My scallop was over cooked, which is unfortunate since I recently had enjoyed a perfectly cooked scallop just around the corner at Beauty and Essex.  The grits and the Mac and cheese were both very yummy and helped make up for many of the overcooking going on elsewhere. Ironically, the table bread may have been the star of the sides show; it was quite good!  For the steaks: One of the specials was a rib cut (8oz portion of their ribeye). I ordered it medium rare and while it was probably 30 seconds past medium rare, the pepper crusting I requested meant the flavor and seasoning of the steak was DYNAMITE. Went down great with the creamy horseradish sauce as well.  Tragically, both of my neighbors who ordered the same dish (also medium rare) got theirs cooked medium and well done, respectively. I'm sorry, but for the prices you're paying at a joint with this reputation, the cook on these has got to be PERFECT. I'm just glad they didn't order the full ribeye, because they would have paid $100 for an over cooked steak! Although, since that 34oz behemoth is the traditional size of the cuts they're cooking, the fact that 8 oz cuts were being ordered is probably why the steaks were over. I have some empathy for that, but again, when you are a place like this with prices like this and you advertise this as your special, you've got to nail it.  Ambiance & flavor were mostly excellent. Everything else was less successful. With Beauty & Essex and Rose Rabbit Lie just a few doors down, I'm not sure I would choose this place first.",

    "text": "We very recently enjoyed an excellent meal here with friends on my son's and daughter-in-law's generous Xmas gift card.  One time before we were seated near the restaurant entrance, but this time in a large booth in the rear of the packed restaurant, which I liked much better.  The pulsing beats put out by the DJ in front were fine, but I prefer a more quiet atmosphere when I am fine dining in an elegant setting, as here.  We began with a very good Shrimp Cocktail sporting 5 medium-sized shrimps, and 2 pricey soft Divers Scallops that were tasty but really not that special or big enough for all of us.  We also destroyed an entire loaf of excellent complimentary pull-apart Bleu Cheese Bread with Olive Oil with Chive Sauce, as well as another complimentary plain tufted Bread that we separated into sections and slathered with butter.    A Caesar Salad featuring Hearts of Romaine was so big I shared it with two other members of our group.  It was also a delicious classic Caesar Salad.    This time I was more in the mood for seafood, so I ordered what turned out to be a perfectly cooked and moist Grilled Salmon situated on a base of Arugula and Wild Mushrooms, with a Wine Vinaigrette sprinkled on top.  Meanwhile, Diane enjoyed a buttery medium-rare Ribcap with Bearnaise Sauce.  As sides our foursome shared soft and creamy Tater Tots, seriously lobster-filled Lobster Mac N Cheese, and grilled Brussels Sprouts.  Service by Isaac and several assistants was very good and responsive, but to my surprise I was told by a manager that this STK did not participate in the promotion whereby we held two $25 off coupons.  I expected that at least one would be honored.    But the manager said he would do something special to make it up to us, and he most decidedly did.  For, at meal's end we were presented with a complimentary platter of 4 Fried Doughnuts and Whipped Cream adjoining a large, nicely melted Chocolate Chip Cookie topped by Vanilla Ice Cream.  I hadn't planned on ordering any dessert, but it turned out to be a highlight of a memorable meal.",

Highlights were the foie, house bread, truffle mash, and the porterhouse.

    "text": "Last visited in 2016, shortly after Pastry Chef Brigette Contreras accepted an offer to re-imagine the Restaurant's Dessert menu, it was on Wednesday night that STK was found predictably packed, an ongoing situation for the concept originating out of Los Angeles and now spread across the globe.   Serving Sin City since The Cosmopolitan's grand opening,  one of several Restaurants that has survived the property's sale and most certainly the most successful, it is on the third floor that STK opens its doors at 4:30pm daily, Executive Chef Stephen Hopcraft manning stoves focused on Steaks and Sides while a good looking staff serves an even more attractive crowd.  As serious a Steakhouse as it needs to be, the \"see and be seen\" aspect of a place lit such that everyone appears a little sexier impossible to ignore, it is passing by a bar often three-deep that diners find banquettes built for small and large parties, the music loud enough to create a pulse and eventually best described as \"thumping\" once the place is full.  Energetic with servers to match, professionalism plus a bit of witty banter generating several laughs across the course of ninety-minutes, it was declining Cocktails that dinner began with the first of two Brioche Loaves,  arguably Las Vegas' best complimentary Carbohydrate thanks to soft morsels slathered in Blue Cheese Butter abut still greedy to sop up fragrant green Oil.   Unafraid to be creative, though luxury items frequently come with a price-tag to match, it was having already tasted several STK Signatures during a prior visit that Dinner began with Chef Hopcraft's Foie Gras Pop Tart, the seared Liver inside still sporting a few veins but otherwise delicious inside crisp Pastry topped in housemade Jam and a equal drizzle of Icing.  Onward next to Entrees and additions, mixed seasonal Mushrooms and Cream under a golden dome still one of the best Steakhouse sides in town, it was in addition to crisp Tots with Remoulade that $100+ Market Price Lobster was presented, a generous two-pounds nicely poached in Butter and bolstered by Morels with a \"Thermidor\" feel, though the Croquettes were filled with King Crab as opposed to Potatoes.  Saving plenty of room for Dessert, a bottomless cup of hot Coffee cleansing the palate between bites, it is at $15 each and $20 for #THECLOUD that Chef Contreras' work is offered, the hashtagged new addition torched tableside to reveal delicate Strawberry Shortcake imbued with a bit of Booze that plays well off wisps of Sugar while Sweet Potato Donuts dripping in Maple Glaze remain an STK signature for good reason.  Using Cremeux in place of Ganache to lighten Flourless Chocolate Cake, a clever maneuver that allows each layer its own identity and the dish as a whole unexpected levity, it is even creamier that guests will find Cheesecake splattered by Blueberries and perfumed by Lemon, though night's sweetest bites came by way of \"Banana Bread Pudding\" served Sticky Toffee-style with a crisp Feuilletine and Vanilla Ice Cream helping to mellow locally-made Banana Whiskey.   FOUR STARS:  In a city full of serious Steakhouses it may seem surprising that STK continues to pack 'em in nightly, yet despite being trendy before everyone had Instagram the brand has remained relevant by sticking to big flavors and fun presentations plus some of Las Vegas' most under-discussed desserts from Pastry Chef Brigette Contreras.",

I would return just for the bread itself-drizzled with warm blue cheese butter whaatt??",

What we had - dry, overcooked chicken breast, overly charred steak cooked rare, not medium, an extremely runny lobster Mac and cheese and cauliflower gratin all of which was lukewarm and under seasoned. To me the food tasted like it sat under a heat lamp since both of the sides were not hot, just barely warmed through. The chicken tasted pre cooked, under seasoned and came without any sauce whatsoever; server told us chicken was made to order, but it's impossible to roast a bone in chicken breast in 5 minutes - server took our order and brought my chicken and hubby's steak out within 4-5 minutes! The bread is freshly made and delicious served with basil dipping oil, the atmosphere is fresh and on point, background club music is good and the servers attentive.",

I made a reservation in advance since I figured Monday would be busy since it's their weekly industry night. I was right. Even with the reservation, we had to wait a bit but the ambiance was fun so we didn't mind. Being a member of the industry, our dinner automatically got 25% off; one of the servers brought us three extra sides (and refused to take them back or charge us even though we told him we hadn't ordered them). All of our steaks (three different temperatures) were cooked PERFECTLY, and everything else was in a great sharable size. We got the cheesecake lollipops and the creme brulee trio for dessert to split amongst us. Everything was fabulous, the food was great, the music was fun, the atmosphere was not at all what we expected and we loved it. Would definitely come back!",

    "text": "LOVE this place. LOVE it! Came here for a Bachelorette Party dinner for my bestie and I made my reservations as soon as I found out we where going to Vegas. I was just at the Cosmo a few months back and wanted to have the girls have dinner here and enjoy the lounge and atmosphere of STK and the Cosmopolitian. Because I'm a planning nazi, I downloaded the menu and picked out what I was going to get 2 months ahead of time (I'm a little picky). I quickly saw that it was a pricey place, but I checked they YELP reviews and decided it was worth the try.  We arrived on time for our reservations and we were asked to wait in the \"lounge\" which was a couple of tables beside the bar that was already taken by other parities that were waiting. We stood around for a brief minute and was ushered to our table on the second level of the restaurant. First thing I have to say is how beautiful this place was. It was hip, artsy, dark colors complimented by white, all that frou frou Cosmo/Vegas stuff.  We met our server, Isaac, who was SOOOO GREAT, which is a relief because I was a little worried that since it was so busy that the staff would be subpar on the service front. But Isaac totally showed us that he is excellent at what he does, and my girlfriends loved him! THe food was fantastic, I got the Shrimp Rice Crispies, a few people got steak or tartare. The sides were good too, esp the Lobster Macaroni! YUM! Again, it is a bit pricey but you are paying for the service, food, ambience, and location.  If you are visiting the Cosmopolitian with friends, on a date, etc, I would highly recommend going to the Vesper or Chandelier Lounge before dinner and have a drink! Take the time to enjoy the super beautiful hotel! Then have a great dinner at STK!",

Other than that, the people running this place are completely unqualified and have no business in the service industry.  I had a 9:30pm reservation last week.  Needless to say, this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I've been dining out in Vegas for over 10 years and have always had exceptional meals and experiences.  These were the most pretentious, obnoxious, rude and unprofessional people.  I don't mind waiting 15 minutes for a reservation, but we didn't sit down until 10:45pm.  No one at the host desk apologized, offered us a round of drinks, nothing.  They just ignored us. When we finally sat down, the woman who sat us didn't even apologize.  We had a very nice waiter who was apologetic even though it wasn't his fault.  He got the \"manager\" for us and some guy named Josh came over, apologized and offered to \"take care of us\" during our dining experience.  That never happened.  So fake!  Folks, if you want to eat here, go early, expect to wait and expect the hosts and managers to be inattentive and rude.  I think they are there to look like they are in control, with their headsets and designer suits and skimpy outfits.  They are pretty much useless.  If you need to eat in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, go to Blue Ribbon Sushi, these guys know what they are doing, service is great and the food is crazy good!  If you really want an STK experience, go to the STK in NY, at least they know what they are doing there.",

The music was a bit loud and made casual conversation with my party near impossible although the mix of music was excellent. Considering I'm a bit anti-social this actually suited me fine. The bathroom situation is a bit rough - there are only two restrooms (men/women) and each is set-up for one person to use at a time. Needless to say, there was quite a line and it didn't help that women kept walking into the mens room. Overall my visit was good but considering I dropped over $500 for a party of four it could have been better, quieter and taking a leak shouldn't have required so much effort.",

    "text": "An atypical steak house. We had reservations for dinner and they were running about 45 min behind... No big deal because we went to the bar. However, the entire place was very loud and had thumping music like a dance club so conversations were impossible. I liked the atmosphere but unexpected for what we thought would be a nice dinner. The food was excellent, loved the fillet and side dishes. My beet salad was just ok but beautiful presentation.  All four of us were happy with the food but not expecting the noise. I thought the prices were reasonable except for wine.... Big reds were about $35 a glass. Service was pretty good too. I would recommend this place if  you love steak, but beware the noise level.",

As we were seated we acclimated to the environment and quickly ordered a cocktail to forget about the stressful journey on the I-15. The vibe is great and I love the House DJ added to mix things up, Vegas we have arrived. A quick glance at the menu and our orders were placed. We chose the Tuna Tartar to start, followed by the Filet and Pan Seared Organic Chicken. The decision on the sides was the tough part; offering a mouthwatering spread of Lobster Mac & Cheese, Sweet Corn Pudding, Mushroom Pot Pie and Spiced Maple Carrots to name a few. I went with the Parmesan Truffle Fries...you know me and Truffles! Hats off to the Chef, we finished everything on our plates. If you can't make it to Vegas, I highly suggest visiting their location in LA.",

The room had a lot of energy and very attractive people. Our server was very entertaining and friendly, but a little slow. His personality made up it.

Shene (the serving assistant? bus boy?) fortunately delivered on making sure we had a great experience and made sure we were paid attention to.

And, it's a good thing we had reservations, too, because this place is quite a hot spot and we otherwise would likely have had a substantial wait for a table.  The atmosphere is lively and the crowd was generally very attractive and the music gave the place a nice vibe.  And, I must say, the wait staff - all of them - were very pleasing on the eyes.  Our server was quite hot and she was very friendly and relaxed.  And, she was very attentive, while remaining unobtrusive.  I enjoyed everything I ordered.  As others have mentioned, the complimentary bread with blue butter is just delicious, but don't fill up on it.  You'll need the room for everything else.   The Beet salad with goat cheese was quite refreshing and all of the veggies beautifully presented.  We enjoyed two dozen of the oysters on the half shell with an assortment of sauces nicely arranged over ice.  I had the 14 ounce filet on the bone and it was succulent, tender, cooked to perfection and topped with truffle butter - absolutely delicious.  Along with the steak, I also had parmesan crusted truffle fries.  This is a cool place to party with your friends or a nice place to take a business associate.",

We were greeted right away by our server, Chris, who gave us a crash course in the menu and offered a few recommendations. Chris was knowledgable and very personable, and his expert service was nothing less than exceptional.  To start, I enjoyed the beet and arugula salad which was wonderful and finished the course with their 20oz bone-in ribeye (med rare, of course) topped with bacon butter, because why would you not? Happily sampled a bit of my friends skirt steak as well which was likewise, outstanding. Oh! And a quick side note; if you're a manhattan drinker, you'll be pleased to know they carry Carpano Antica... And yes, it absolutely matters.  Anyway, I only visit Las Vegas once or twice a year but I'm pleased to say with certainty that I will be coming back to STK.  So, a quick recap?  Ambiance - 10 Food - 10 Service - 11 (We were a five top and water glasses not ONCE went empty.)  In short, STK comes with just about my highest recommendation. Well done.",

When we got there, there were only two other tables with people the rest of the restaurant was empty!  We all started with a cocktail: french martini, dirty martini and some sort of whiskey drink.  We then ordered a bottle of champagne (we were celebrating our friend getting married!).  Appetizers: - Heirloom Tomato Salad ($20): burrata, tomatoes, olive oil & balsamic. *this was my appetizer and it was delicious! But I'm a sucker for anything with burrata. -Blue Iceberg Salad ($15): smoked bacon, blue cheese, picked tomato. *Friend ordered this one.  I tasted it.  The blue cheese dressing was yummy an so was the bacon. *Beef Tartare ($20): black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel *Friend ordered this one and loved it! *Foie Gras French Toast ($24): green apple, almond brioche, sherry gastrique *Friend also loved this one!  Main Entrees: -Skirt Steak, 7 oz. ($29) *I ordered this cooked as medium rare plus.  I have never ordered skirt steak from a restaurant but this was delicious!!  Great flavor, perfectly cooked. -Filet Medallion, 7 oz. ($37) *Friend ordered this medium rare.  I tried a piece and this was my favorite out of the three steaks. -I don't remember the third steak, but she got it with the peppercorn crusted, which was tasty.  For the side, we had the parmesan truffle fries ($11).  They were cut like steak fries, but crispy and oh so yummy!  Our waitress was great and brought out some desserts for our celebration: little cheesecakes, 3 mini ice cream cones and their bread pudding.  OMG their bread pudding!  So yummy!!!  I think our bill came to $498 total.  Would definitely head there again!  Fun atmosphere; it got louder as we left (around 8:30pm) and the service was fantastic.  *Note: everything is a la carte, but enough to share!",

    "text": "A lot of people I know consider Vegas a True desert when it comes to finding outstanding food. Food that blows you away and makes you want to come back to Vegas just for a particular restaurant. They say it's glitz and glamour, expensive and flashy, and food takes a backseat. No where else is this more True than STK.   It's a great looking restaurant. It's hip with loud music and good looking servers and bartenders. You're definitely not at a loss for eye candy with the patrons. Actually not a bad place for the fellas to have a group dinner if they want to drop some coin on a place where food isn't the emphasis. Unfortunately I was here dining alone on business and food was my only friend.  I don't think I need to go in to detail because I've personally never cared for detailed reviews of mediocre food.  I will say this.... at some level a place like this does have to get certain things right.. I mean, people do have taste buds and people do come here. So as long as food isn't the emphasis and there's some other reason pulling you here: another person chose it, you want to oogle at hot bartenders, you like dining in a club atmosphere, you can probably get outa here satisfied. Just know whatever you order isn't going to be on any of your bests lists.",

So I started at the south end of the strip and thought I'd walk until I found something to suit my mood. Stepped into a few spots and kept walking. I swung through Cosmopolitan and an irresistible steakhouse aroma clutched me. I asked a hotel concierge to tell me the source and in a short walk I was sliding on to a stool at the STK bar- fine for a solo. I liked the atmosphere which was lively and busy with a great DJ mix as a backdrop. The volume issues that I've read from others was not an issue for me because I wasn't engaged in any challenging conversations.   I had the foie gras french toast, bone-in rib and a moscow mule. I enjoyed everything about them.   I will say that I can't appreciate the rest room format. Get in line outside? Wait your turn? Follow the attendant's commands? Sir, may I use the bathroom? NO! What? Fix that.  I'll be visiting Vegas again soon to celebrate my son's birthday and I'm pretty sure he'd like it as much as I, so I'll be back.",

The filet medium well, was amazing! Also the sides are family sized! We ordered the regular Mac & Cheese also amazing! Will definitely return as well as check out STK L.A.!",

    "text": "If you're in California, your foie gras eating days are numbered. It seems that my home state will outlaw the selling of the delicacy in a few weeks. Anyhow, with that in mind, read on...  While visiting over this past Labor Day weekend, a few friends and I decided to give STK a try.  Stymied in deciding what to eat for dinner one day, we went online and found out it was actually Restaurant Week in Las Vegas the weekend we were there.  After going through the list of participating restaurants, one of my friends indicated that he always wanted to try STK and that he only heard good things about it.  We then made a reservation for four and actually planned the rest of our day in getting there on time.  We were split during the good part of the day, but as the reservation time approached, we started arriving at the Cosmopolitan to go upstairs to the restaurant.  The service was very professional and it was good to see waiters who can joke around, make good recommendations and still be attentive.  The funny thing was that I asked the hostess for a Restaurant Week menu all around, but after glancing at the actual dinner menu, we abandoned that pre-fixed menu pretty quickly and went all out.  I ended up getting some filet medallions with bleu cheese spread, and others had the prime rib. Though the portions were on the smaller size (definitely not Lawry's or Mastro's sized), it was well made and actually left you wanting more...which is probably the whole idea behind the smaller portions anyway.  The brought out our sides on ironcast bowls, which helped keep things hot. The mashed potatoes were really whipped well...to the point of it being almost a thick liquid. It was buttered, which was nice.  One of the items we got was foie gras to be spread over slices of baguette. I've had foie gras sparingly, but I have to admit that that was pretty good. Good smooth texture and a crunchy bread created a nice combination. It gives that duck-ish aftertaste, but I recommend it, if you don't really mind that. This was one of the better instances of it, and I'm disappointed that California will be placing a ban on serving the delicacy. I suppose I can only really have it if I go back to Las Vegas in the future (which happens often enough, I guess).  The truffle mac and cheese was okay. I actually used it to clear the palate. It was definitely cheesy, but I felt it lacked a bit of salt or richness.  For such a classy steakhouse, being in Las Vegas does have its downside. The highlight of the evening had to be leaving STK. As the four of us were walking out, right outside the restaurant was a dude dressed up in only his boxer shorts. Nothing else. I could tell the mater d' and the host staff wanted to say something to the man, like GTFO, but since he wasn't technically inside STK (just outside of it), they couldn't do anything. It was just such a contrast to have this pretty much naked man greeting the well-heeled people entering and leaving the place.",

Our waiter said the cowboy steak is good for two and that the steak would range from medium rare to medium well. When we got the steak; it was too rare for me. So he grabbed a couple pieces and brought it to the kitchen to cook for me. I thought that the gesture was extremely guest satisfying. The mac and cheese and shrimp cocktail are worth getting!   Cons: chairs are too close and the Parmesan fries weren't the best.",

The room is the reason that this isn't a five star review. It was very small and confined--there was padding on the walls that made it feel very claustrophobic. I would have preferred a bit more space. That said, the rest of the evening was great. The service was impeccable-no issues with getting anything! We started with a pan-bread and shrimp cocktail-both were excellent and extremely flavorful. We then had sliders which were out of this world. I had a quinoa and kale salad that was perfectly dressed as a starter. The star of the show was the halibut with brussel sprouts. I have never had a piece of fish that I have enjoyed so much. Dessert was a decadent mousse with fresh berries- also out of this world. I cannot say enough good things about the food and service here and would highly recommend to anyone in Vegas looking for a great meal.",

After you order your food, they bring out some house bread which was pretty good. For appetizer, I shared the Tuna tartare. It was so good but the portion is pretty small.  It's good to share maybe with 1 other person. I shared the bone in rib steak (20 oz) and good thing I shared because both me and my sister couldn't even finish our own half!  The steak was sooo good. It was so flavorful without a topping or sauce. It was charred perfectly. Probably one of the best steaks I've eaten.  We also ordered the trio mac n cheese which was off the menu. It was regular mac n cheese, lobster, and truffle. This was good enough for 4 people. My favorite was the truffle mac n cheese.  We also shared the Brussels sprouts with bacon, also off the menu, and it was delicious. Just an FYI, the trio mac n cheese is $55.   We also got drinks which were on the pricey side.   Service was on point. Our server was really nice and the food came out quick.",

We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!    All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.  Another reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner.   The only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!",

FOOD: (5 out of 5 stars)  -BREAD - omg the bread is so delicious and the green olive oil dip thing was good!! I feel that other places over do the olive taste in the olive oil dip, but this was amazing and so good. The bread was also so tender and soft yet crunchy and warm on the outside. DEFINITELY enjoy your bread!!! -STEAK LOIN STRIP - so tender and juicy and delicious!!! omg this was amazing. -MAC N CHEESE - omg i love their mac n cheese. GET IT!!! definitely worth it.  -PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES - these are not like your typical fries. they're short and chunky, but they bring them out and it has just the right amount of parmesan topping (some places over due the parmesan). Its super warm and crunchy on the outside while warm on the inside.   DRINKS (5 out of 5) -strawberry cobbler graham crackers drink - if you're a girl, and u dont like the taste of alcohol and like sweet drinks, definitely get this!!! this was one of the better drinks i've drank in my life from a restaurant place.  -jack and coke - SUPER strong. they definitely give you your jack for your monies. -stk orgy shot - $15/shot or something like that, but it was GOOD. esp for a girl who doesn't like the taste of alcohol. if you're here celebrating a special event and you're with a girl who can't take regular shots, definitely order this one!  ATMOSPHERE (4 out of 5) I liked the atmosphere, but the one draw back was that the music was a lil loud. They were playing up to date music and nice remixes / mashups, which is nice. I'm not complaining about the music selection at all!! But the volume could have been turned down, especially for a Sunday night dinner.  The waiters were incredibly social and super chill. They were having the time of their lives while serving us and dancing around and clapping while on the job.   Perfect place to go for a pre-clubbing pre-outing atmosphere. If youre going to Marquee,  or a similar club , this is the perfect place for a pre-game dinner and drinks.  Also recommended if you're looking for a non-buffet, nice sit down restaurant to celebrate a special occasion with good music and good food (as long as you don't mind the volume)",

    "text": "STK is AOK!  Service at this place is phenomenal!  Great hostess, terrific waitress (Ashley?) and super support team.  The only off note was the douchebag bartender who was at least honest when he said that if you want good beer you can't get it there but lose the attitude bro; you're not guest starring on an episode of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" yet.  Food is amazing...we had oysters, french toast foie gras, steaks, mac and cheese, parmesan fries, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  My steak (at 10 oz strip) was well prepared and the accompanying horseradish sauce was epic.  However, for $41 I thought it was a bit pricey.   The sides are all about $11 or $12 and they are Delicious (mac and cheese, asparagus and mashed potatoes were standouts) but the portions are not that big.    So you see me use words like \"phenomenal\" and \"amazing\" and you're thinking \"But Bill, you only give this place four stars.  What's up with that, yo?\"  Let me break it down for you.  The things that keep it from being five stars are:  1. Limited beer options -this is a steak house, not some OB/GYN office, right?  I mean do you want to give me a Brazilian while you force me to drink a cosmo?  Sheesh. 2. Extraordinary prices.  OMG this place is expensive. 3. The one person per use bathrooms.  There was always a line and for a men's room that's unnecessary.  We can use troughs, for heaven's sake. 4. Bathroom attendant.  Since you have to stand in the hall to wait for the can, you're sort of forced to make small talk with the guy who is awkwardly blocking the en trace to the loo.  Just not my cup of tea. 5. Great music but loud and thumpy (sort of like a date I had once).  Is this a club or a restaurant.  Prepare to be hoarse from screaming and deaf from the music after eating here.  Those five quibbles aside, this is an awesome place.",

We told the server, she took them back to the kitchen and gave us new ones.  The second time, they gave us rare (but we want medium rare), meat were still cold inside! Super disappointing!!!!!! Totally NOT worth that price!   For side orders, wild mushrooms, mac and cheese, mushroom hot pie were good with no suprise. For the asparagus, they were just plain! I think they just boiled the asparagus with water then put several drips of something like soy sauce on top. They didn't even grill them or putting some seasoning on. And it costs $12!   We went with all excitements after reading all those good reviews. After this experience, I WON'T go back for sure.",

I really expected more when I came here to dine considering the relatively expensive prices for all of their meats (compared to other the higher priced places in Vegas), STK did not compare. Prime has much better steak at better prices, quality and portions. Also tried out their tuna, it was alright very much on the bland side even with the sauce, I felt like asking for soy-sauce (but that would've been weird). The only part of the entire meal that stood out were the parmesan truffle fries which were perfectly done to the right crispiness.   The ambiance is quite loud, not the best place to take someone out for a romantic date as it's hard to even hear yourself. Fun place to hang out with friends to drink and eat though.   Service was spotty, it was often times hard to flag down someone to refill waters or to even request simple utensils which was a bit frustrating but it was jam packed at the time so I'll cut them some slack.",

Inside of the Cosmopolitan, it's located on the restaurant level in an area away from all of the commotion of the casino. Everything that I've ever had here tastes amazing; you'll fall in love with food if you're not already a foodie.  Even though you can show up in jeans and a t-shirt, to enjoy the full experience, you'll want to dress up a bit. The professionalism of the service is excellent - you're never left needing anything.  From time to time, there's a bit of a wait (if you don't already have a reservation) so just outside there's a pool table you can hang out at and a few trendy lounge chairs to chill in.  This is one of our favorite steak houses on the strip and we will definitely go back soon!",

    "text": "For the price, I was not impressed with this place at all. It was very hyped up for me as the best steak in Vegas, but honestly, I would've preferred the steak at Bacchanal or at Bellagio. Actually, I had steak the night before at The Henry and THAT was amazing.  I ordered one of the most expensive steaks on the menu here at STK - an 8 oz cut of wagyu. Got foie gras on top as well, and a side of mashed potatoes ($12 for a small cup...). Also ordered the sliders they're supposedly famous for.  The sliders were very good, but overpriced.  The wagyu was not tender and flavorful at all. My friend got the ribeye and it was significantly better, but still not as good at The Henry's (so I still wouldn't come back to STK even to get something else). The foie gras wasn't very good, and we sent it back to cook further, which improved it but we've still all had better. Finally, the mashed potatoes were good, but at $12 for such a small amount, it wasn't worth remembering.  Overall, our meal was nearly $160 for 2 small sliders, 8 oz. wagyu which didn't even taste like wagyu, foie gras, and mashed potatoes. Was totally not worth it.",

Atmosphere is supposed to be laid back with the Severs in pjs and a live band playing (which we never saw when we were there...only a loud DJ). They start out your meal with monkey bread and cream cheese dipping sauce. I found it to be sickening sweet but my husband thought it wasn't too bad. He liked it. For entrees we ordered shrimp & grits and short rib hash. Both were good but rather small. The shrimp & grits could have been served in a martini glass because it was the size of a shrimp cocktail. The grits looked like a lot but they were spread so thin on the plate you only got a few bites. Same with the hash. Also, my husband asked for egg whites that he did not get. Service was good but we felt rushed. We were only there 30 minutes! Talk about trying to turn over tables fast! We thought brunch would be leisurely & sit back and enjoy ourselves but oh well. Decided to get another drink somewhere else. So for our meals, 1 glass of champagne, & a beer it was just under $90 plus tip. Too expensive for what you get. We both agree we wouldn't recommend STK to anyone or go back.",

It was crazy loud and practically like a club. Wasn't a big fan of that. Our waiter was super polite and friendly. Checked on us regularly.   Yellowtail appetizer was yummy. Fresh and it surprisingly goes well with apples. It also has a citrusy sauce that comes with it.  My boyfriends bone-in ribeye was okay. Wasn't juicy enough. Had better.  I got the bone-in filet. Asked for medium rare. Was slightly over cooked in my opinion. But the portion by the bone was amazing. We both got the STK sauce. Their house steak sauce was sweeter than I expected. The boyfriend wasn't a big fan, but I thought it was okay. I think the STK bold would have been a better choice.  We shared the cream corn pudding. That was a favorite. Tasted like a sweet mashed potato with pieces of corn.   Overall, the food was okay.",

We made a reservation for dinner and was seated near their bar area, which made for interesting people watching. Our waitress was upbeat and friendly. Everything was going well... until the food came.  The steaks that were supposed to be spectacular were dry, chewy, and lacking in flavor. Even without shelling an additional $2 for sauces, steaks should stand on their own merit.  I had the seared tuna. The tuna itself was fresh, but the sauce used was way too heavy and overwhelming for such a delicate, 'lean' fish (as opposed to another type of fish, such as salmon). Did not hold together as a coherent entree at all.  The mushroom pot pie was the star of the show, and the fries were thick cut, and while crispy, was inundated in truffle oil flavor. I am starting to agree with Gordon Ramsey who says that truffle oil is the one ingredient that is reserved for amateurs. Way too much reliance on truffle oil to make the side 'great.'  With the price we paid for this meal we could've gotten an amazing steak dinner off the strip. Perhaps it was my mistake to expect good food from STK.  3-stars still, because I liked the ambiance and the service. 2 stars off for mediocre and disappointing food at a price point and location that should have guaranteed quality.",

On the menu for happy hour you'll find apps for $10 (slider with fries, small salad, prawns, oysters, beef tartar) with a selection of beer for $5 and Belvedere cocktails for $8. My husband decided to try the slider, which came with delicious truffle fries and we both ordered Belvedere cocktails. Service was great and the ambience was romantic and inviting. The dinner menu looked good also but a bit on the pricey side (which is to be expected for STK). Highly recommend grabbing a quick drink here if you're in the Cosmo and have other dinner plans.",

The Brussel Sprouts and beef tartar are phenomenal and I highly recommend them.   I got to enjoy the 14oz Bone In Filet for dinner and I was more than pleasantly pleased. The steak was seared medium rare to perfection topped with the most amazing tasting truffle butter. Add a couple of glasses of wine and you're all set!

Kind of hard to swallow. We were seated and Steve was our server. He wasn't the most welcoming server I've ever had, but his team was great. First off, this place is higher priced than any steak house I've EVER been to! (Del Frisco's, Mastro's, Delmonico, Cut, Vic & Anthony's, Envy...) You get my point. My three stars has EVERYTHING to do with our server hurrying us and the prices. They start with seasoned butter and brioche seasoned 2 ways. Delicious! We split a beet salad that was outstanding and had one of the specials, an 8oz filet Oscar Style for $77! Our dinner was served while we were still eating our salad! Unacceptable! That's on the server! They were great and split them in the kitchen and everything was plated beautifully. However, Oscar Style is asparagus and LUMP CRAB or at the very least, pieces. This looked like tuna flakes in butter over the filet. I will say that the steak was a perfect medium rare and flavor was phenomenal. If you can get away with that for the money...who am I to argue. All sides are minimum $15 and they say, \"Shareable for 2.\" They're shareable if you order more than one! Mac & cheese was yummy, as were the regular mashed potatoes. One of our diners is vegan and they made a beautiful veggie risotto that she absolutely loved! It was my husband's birthday and they brought out a really nice dessert. Oh, their desserts are all just a mere $20 each. I have no problem spending the money if you get a decent portion and good service. If I have to compare apples to apples, any of the aforementioned restaurants is getting my business before this one.",

The Parmesan fries and corn pudding were highlights as was the peppercorn crusting on the meats. I had the filet which was cooked perfectly. Plus they do bone-in as an option.   Now STK isn't cheap. In fact it's a tad overpriced relative to portion size. Plus the appetizers were not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. But...

Ordered their special of the night: Chilean Sea Bass (on a bed of porcini mushrooms and topped with shaved black truffle): So tasty! The Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked and the bed of mushrooms were DELICIOUS. However, because of how flavorful the porcini was, the delicate truffle was lost. However, I was amazed by the sheer quantity of truffle. This dish was swimming in it.   No meal is complete without sides: *Mac & Cheese: I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use but it was more white/mild? Eh. Skip it.  *Sweet Corn Pudding: People rave about this and I can see why. It's sweet, creamy and kind of like mashed potatoes! Probably not any healthier than mashed potatoes but still tasty *Haricot Vert: Pretty standard but gotta get your greens in!  *Broccolini: Super salty.  Overall, great Vegas dining experience. Upbeat music. Cheery staff. Good food!",

It was during CES so very entertaining crowd watching. Nestled in a great spot in the Cosmo. Great atmosphere.  So of course, it being Saturday night, the place was packed. Reservations were made days before so we were solid.  For starters, we had a dozen Oysters and Burrata. Both were great and the Oysters were from the PNW - so pretty delicious.  For the main course I had the bone-in Ribeye at med-rare. Topped with truffle butter, though it did not need that. It was rich, flavorful and cooked perfectly. Very good. My wife had the Roasted Dover Sole which was out of this world and is something that she is craving, even now. So mad kudo's for doing the fish perfect for her!  We didn't do desert cause we wanted to try David Chang's newly opened Milk Bar on the floor below!  Great place and is a solid option if you are dining on the strip! Yes, it is safe to say that we will be returning here for dinner in the near future! Enjoy!",

They has this dark sexy vibe going on with really great music ! And I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu ! With Yummy food,a great wine collection and friendly staff ( specially the super nice gentleman standing by the restrooms ) STK gives you the perfect VEGAS dinning experience !!",

This place should have amazing food because it's pricey and they have everything else going on. The vibe is a lot of fun, eye candy everywhere, some are even interesting which is a bonus, it's dark & sexy, the seating is perfect for groups, the music is great, the food is good but in my opinion needs some work.   The issues - my steak was pricey and was very salty & had too many grisly parts. My goddess salad lacked in flavor & creativity. I also tasted my friends Caesar and it was pretty boring. As I mentioned I expect more when paying prices like these.   The good - my friends seared tuna which was perfectly cooked & very flavorful. My friends skirt steak which was more tender then my sirloin and less salty. Our sides were very good, the perfectly cooked asparagus, decadent mac & cheese and the really great jalapeno cheddar grits that were super rich & creamy with just a hint of kick. Dessert was good but nothing amazing. I definitely didn't have any magical moments and I really wish I had. I also need to give a shout out to the complimentary hot buns that come out of the oven in an iron skillet with a very flavorful dipping sauce.   The best part was the company with a large fun group and just having a good time together before the weekend begins! This place is great for larger parties and the service was good too.",

Other than that, the people running this place are completely unqualified and have no business in the service industry.  I had a 9:30pm reservation last week.  Needless to say, this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  I've been dining out in Vegas for over 10 years and have always had exceptional meals and experiences.  These were the most pretentious, obnoxious, rude and unprofessional people.  I don't mind waiting 15 minutes for a reservation, but we didn't sit down until 10:45pm.  No one at the host desk apologized, offered us a round of drinks, nothing.  They just ignored us. When we finally sat down, the woman who sat us didn't even apologize.  We had a very nice waiter who was apologetic even though it wasn't his fault.  He got the \"manager\" for us and some guy named Josh came over, apologized and offered to \"take care of us\" during our dining experience.  That never happened.  So fake!  Folks, if you want to eat here, go early, expect to wait and expect the hosts and managers to be inattentive and rude.  I think they are there to look like they are in control, with their headsets and designer suits and skimpy outfits.  They are pretty much useless.  If you need to eat in the Cosmopolitan Hotel, go to Blue Ribbon Sushi, these guys know what they are doing, service is great and the food is crazy good!  If you really want an STK experience, go to the STK in NY, at least they know what they are doing there.",

And Shady has to admit, with all the scenery the food is actually very good. This year Shady took down the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and delicious on one night, and the sirlion on another. Coupled with some nice red's, the great girls behind the bar, and the scenery all around, STK is just a great night out in Vegas. Shady has been a regular here since it opened 3 years ago, and as long as Shady's ladies are there, so is Shady.

Tuna Tartare- OMG. the Tuna was insanely good. I have never tasted tuna so fresh before.  (We had the opportunity to meet the Executive chef and he actually showed us pictures of the Tuna before they cut it up. It was so great to meet him! He made awesome recommendations!) Skirt Steak- Medium Rare w/Foie Gras Butter - I died and went to heaven   The Chef sent out a sample plate of all the appetizers and desserts so we got to taste a little bit of everything. The Cheesecake Lollipops and Mini Ice Cream Cones had the best presentation and were the perfect way to end our dinner!  The music is super loud, but it's Vegas so it was a good way to amp up our energy before hitting Marquee downstairs, but it was a little difficult to keep conversation at the table since we all had to yell over the music.",

Watch out, though - the management has decided to put some of the bitchiest, snottiest, unfriendly 20-something girls as hostesses, and they have let the power go to their heads! Still waiting on some of your party? You'll have to wait. Want to get in a little earlier than your reservation? You'll have to wait (even if the place isn't crowded). Want a different, larger table? You'll feel the disdain in the roll of their eyes as you ask for that \"special request\".

It got louder as the night progressed, but it wasn't too loud where we couldn't hold a conversation.  We ordered a bunch of stuff since my bf and I decided to share the 20 oz. bone-in rib-eye.  Which I must say was the juiciest and flavorful steak I've ever eaten.  AND it was big enough for the both of us.  For appetizer, we ordered the Foie Gras French Toast and ordered the jumbo lump crab salad, side of roasted carrots, asparagus and mushroom pot pie.  Our friends ordered the 14 oz. bone-in filet, and tuna tartar for their app.  We shared the sides which were the perfect amount of sides for 4 ppl.    The dessert was amazing too!

    "text": "STK isn't for everyone. It's hip, chic, expensive, and loud.  The food is very, very good. Interesting menu choices, prepared with care.  And the service matches the expertise in the kitchen - knowledgeable, attentive, and professional.  I ordered steak with the bleu butter. Yum-my. And my heirloom tomato salad that preceded it was fresh and delicious. Our table of four split two desserts. Each were excellent.  I struggled with the wine list though, in that wines that I normally bypass as \"not good enough\" cost more per glass than I would normally pay for a bottle. I had a hard time justifying the expense of most of them, eventually settling on a $80 Malbec, which may have been the least expensive of the lot.  The dj and his music selections help keep STK moving. He's responsible for a lot of the ambiance of the place but the loud music did make dinner conversation tough.  If STK isn't in your budget for dinner, consider it for a drink or dessert. It's a neat place, worth experiencing.",

If you're a lesser man who's planning to go out after your meal, you might have some difficulties.",

    "text": "My parents who live in NY wanted to treat me to a birthday dinner while I was in Vegas celebrating so they put their credit card on file....the waiter who knew this information was trying to shove every menu item and every type of alcoholic drink known to mankind down my throat and kept reminding me that my parents were paying for dinner which pissed me off so much. Not very classy STK.   The waiter recommended the 20 oz steak, I don't eat steak that often (only on special occasions) so I don't know how big these things are and I'm a tiny girl so when I saw that steak come out I'm like are you serious? Do you see how tiny I am, I can't eat that whole thing! It was too fatty for my liking and I also got the foie gras on top which was delicious but with a 20 oz fatty steak too it was just overwhelming. I was also severely disappointed in the fact that when I got there for my dinner reservation at 6:30 there was NO MUSIC.....I wanted to go to this place because of how lively I heard it was and there was NO MUSIC...is this \"not your daddys steak house only between hours 10-close?\" I don't understand. The bleu cheese bread tasted like popcorn to me..don't ask me why or how just next time you try it think of popcorn before you eat it and i guarantee you'll see what I'm talking about. The $20 tuna tartare appetizer was so tiny that my boyfriend and I had one bite each and we were done...for that price I was expecting way more tuna. Not impressed with the character of the wait staff (or atleast the particularly slimy fellow I had the displeasure of dealing with) or the lack of atmosphere which this place is supposedly all about. All in all a disappointing experience.",

We split the porterhouse steak that was cooked and seasoned to perfection and had asparagus and lobster Mac and cheese that was fabulous but a little pricey.

It was very busy, had to sit in the bar area which has a full menu.    the serves was a bit slow and it felt that if we were rushed out.  the expensive price tag isnt the problem, its you expect a little more than hi, may i take your order, heres the bill good night.

It was ok but really small portion and I wasn't wowed by the flavor - too much spice masked the natural taste of the lobster.  They also plated it atop so much ice that by the time it came to our table some of the ice had melted and ended up overflowing onto my lap:  downer, considering I was dressed up to go out after.  A couple people at our table got steak, which I'm assuming is what STK is known for, and the unanimous opinion was \"meh, ok, but not great\" -- their thoughts not mine so i would still try their steaks for myself.  The dish that stood out to me the most was the Mac n cheese-- delicious.  But the side should not be the star.    And I hate to call them out on this, but after we were done eating and we were sitting, enjoying our wine and coffee, we were rushed out.  Like \"oh we need this table now\" kind of rushed.  I understand they may have been busy, but rushing people out who barely put their forks down was in poor taste and slightly rude.  Granted they offered us free shots at the bar to make up for it....but what if we weren't big drinkers, recovering alcoholics or god forbid, pregnant?  Disappointing.  This was our first time dining here, so I won't be quick to completely dismiss them and never dine here again.  I'm willing to give STK another shot, I just hope next time they're a little more professional.",

We had two orders of Fois gras french toast $22., tuna tartare $18., tuna sashimi $18., half a dozen oyster $18., and a caesars salad.   For dinner we had the sea bass - no good because it's not Chilean sea bass. , bone in ribeye - prepared great, seared big eye tuna - tasty, beef short rib - my friend said very tender and good.   strawberry cobbler $16 - fruity flavor with cracker crusted rim  dirty pearls $17 - vodka & blue cheese stuffed olives. It's different!  White orchid $16. - not a sweet drink, smooth, vodka & slight gin   We weren't going to have any dessert but was talked into ( in a good way) so we ordered the Warm Tres leches cake; Dulce de leche - coconut sorbet - crispy macaroon.

It was stringy on the outside and raw in the middle. The sides we ordered were cold as well. They rushed us through our dinner, served us and had check in hand in 30 minutes. Gave us our $175.00 bottle of wine in solo cups to go. Ummm... Not impressed. We did not bother to complain because we will never be back.",

So we sat around the bar area starving and kept asking if we could sit and order. It was just one person. After about an hour they sat us. They seemed very young and pompous management.  Then they told us we only had 20 minutes left to order because the kitchen was closing. That was their fault for taking so long to seat us. They were not very friendly with us. But our wine guy and bartender were very nice and hospitable, i think they saw what was going on and and felt bad for our situation. One of them even apologized for the management. The food was good but very expensive. But one of the sides were cold. We tried to make to best of it and thanks to the waiter and bar guy it went ok. It was also very very loud in there. We had to yell to speak to each other at the dinner table.  If it was not for the loud music and rude management i would recommend it but whats up with these young punks? We are customers you morons, not homeless bums off the street. We ended up sending around $500 and definitely not worth the price.  We joked about that place all weekend.",

    "text": "A mediocre restaurant with poor service staging as a nice steakhouse slash night club.  I understand lounge music while dining, but having a DJ and the volume on full blast is just way too much.  When I'm at dinner, I like to be able to hear the people I'm sitting with.  It's ridiculous, even shouting my mother and I couldn't hear each other.  STK is a place \"to be seen,\" however it wouldn't hurt them to lean more towards restaurant and focus less on trendy.  STK, are you for pregame drinking or are you for fine dining?  Luckily, I suppose, we just stopped in for a snack at the lounge area.  It's situated so you sort of have to be on the couch next to strangers-- but that's okay.  When the cocktail came around, we ordered the hamachi sashimi and beef tartare.  The food took a little while to come out, but it was busy so thats okay too.    The music I can live with but the service was really why STK is 2 star to me.  The hamachi was good, nothing to rave about but still good.  Instead of receiving beef tartare we were given beef carpaccio so I let the waitress know, and she rudely said \"Well you said carpaccio not tartare but did you want me to take it back?'  YIKES it's not my fault you can't hear me, the music is really loud!  She took it back and we were promptly delivered tuna tartare.  Closer, but still wrong- we let her know and she kind of just walked away.  When she came back (we hadn't touched it) she asked us if we wanted to keep it... confused if she meant keep that instead or keep that also, we just said no just the beef tartare please.  Finally the beef tartare came out from an apologetic busser and it was like the hamachi, good but not the best.  Everyone in the lounge seats next to us had that supposedly amazing bread that everyone keeps yelping about.  Is it complementary?  We never received any... was it because she found us to be difficult?  I also ordered a beet salad to go.  When it says that it comes with arugula, it means a few sprigs.  I would call it more of a side order roasted beets.  I would try STK again because I feel like I need to try some steak and that amazing \"complementary\" bread, but are they open for lunch?  Because I could live without the DJ and that girls attitude.",

The other downer was that I wanted to bring a cake for our 5 year wedding anniversary but when I called to check, they said they did not allow outside cakes because it was against food code.  Ok fine.  Then they offered to have their pastry chef recreate it but they wanted an arm and a leg for a tiny cake.  This is why I give them 4 stars instead of 5.    Our server on the other hand was wonderful!  She had great recommendations and was really friendly.  We went with the beef tartare, hamachi, foie gras french toast, bone-in rib steak and the sweet corn pudding.

Lots of booth seating, which is nice for an intimate date or small group.   The menu is average (steaks, salads, mac n cheese, fish dishes, etc). Our service was good both nights, however 3 of us ordered steaks and they were a little over done. 2 of us didn't mind, however my husband sent his back.

I give two starts only because the both stakes were good! I also tried ceviche and that was a mistake. The shrimp was made with shrimp cake or something, it was not good at all. The ambience was good if you like bar setting.",

The area they moved us to the music was entirely too loud, you could not carry on a conversation with anyone at the table. After the move the food got all messed up. Honestly it's not worth the money. My steak was medium and it was very dry. I definitely can cross this one off our list.  On my most recent trip to Las Vegas we decided to give STK a second chance.  I am so glad we did. The steak was fabulous. And no matter how full you are you MUST HAVE the sweet potato donuts. They are to die for! Emil Chamie the manager did an outstanding job. Thanks",

He was nice, attentive, can't say enough. The food is on my list of best ever. Get the truffle butter on your steak. Sooooo good. And so worth the money. That said, female staff at the hostess area could be a bit friendlier and so could the female bartenders. Maybe it was just the other night but that did stand out.",

The service was solid and the drinks were on point. Truly an amazing experience. And I expect to pay a premium. But $12 for #truffle #butter is just silly. It wasn't shaved #blacktruffle , it was a small round pad of butter. Butter with most likely a miniscule amount of truffle oil. I think STK should donate the $11.50 or 96% of profit they make on their butter to starving children. Or just charge me $5 for your butter an I'll make the donation. Or I just stop being a glutton and put my money towards helping others. Or I shut up and just enjoy my fatty steak and butter. #foodie #instafood #steak #martini #vegas #vegasbaby #fat",

The food is always top notch and we continue to eat her because we know we won't have a bad meal.  I finally had the famous donuts, and TBQH, I'd come here just to eat those.  Everything was wonderful per usual, the only reason I'm writing this time though is I wanted to point out that other restaurants at this price range in Vegas have servers that are extremely informed on the menu.  Our server, who was really lovely in all other regards, couldn't tell us what the specials were (if any) and couldn't really talk about the steaks or their flavor profiles when we asked.  So really this is just nitpicking, but it stood out.   And I want to reiterate that he was a really good server, the food was amazing, but the 4 stars is for not really knowing the menu being presented.  This won't stop us from coming back.  I need more of those amazing donuts.",

If you're a fan of fine dining with an amazing ambiance, check out STK in Vegas. Service is bar none, Jill was incredible! The manager, Emil went over and above to make sure we were taken care of.

Based on my visit to the STK in Vegas last weekend, I can see how that reputation is earned.  The food wasn't amazing, but they did prepare the bone-in filet rare as I had asked.  The wine list is expensive, and $105 for a 2012 Freemark Abbey Cabernet was among the better \"value\" (i.e. less marked-up) bottles on the list, although this is common to most steakhouses.  Overall, a dark, loud, fun, energetic restaurant with high prices and decent food.  With so many options in Vegas (and in Chicago, where I live), I'm unlikely to choose to return before trying a whole bunch of others, yet I would go if I were in Vegas again with others who insisted.",

From everything that I've read and heard, the loud head-pounding music can be a turn off for those who yearn for a romantic candle-lit dinner, where you can actually hear each other conversate and not just pretend to be. So my tip for you would be book your reservation at a really early time, our was for 5:30pm.   I requested a booth so that we could have more seating and arm room. My request was readily accounted for. Our server was really sweet and genuine. I had to wait for a cocktail for over 30min even though the place was not quite packed yet, but I guess they had to go fetch a watermelon, so she told me the cocktail would be on the house. I appreciated the nice gesture, and that my cocktail was being freshly made.   We started off with the beef carpaccio w/ pesto angel hair, fried lobster tail and crab salad w/ honeydew and grapefruit. Everything was delish, and balanced each other very nicely.   The hubby chose the porterhouse and I ended up w/ the bone-in-filet topped w/ Foie gras. Sides were truffle Parmesan fries, brocollini and corn pudding. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, but the Stk sauce that we chose didn't complement it very well. I wished our steak was seasoned just a bit more, so that no sauce was needed. After our request for A1 came, it made everything so much better!! The corn pudding had too much fillers and not enough corn so I would skip out on that next time. I loved my thick cut truffle fries, but it was way too pungent tasting for the hubs.   As for dessert, we just had to get the sweet potato donuts! We were so full, but luckily the donuts were light and airy. We had an enjoyable evening, but I'm not sure if we would be back w/ all the many Vegas options there is that we have yet to try.",

The flavor was good and the service was a little slow but good. The wine presentation and pour was correct. The presentation of the food was very bland. It was also overpacked. 6 people at a table for 4. They added chairs to the tabke, which were very uncomfortable.

The delmonico was delicious. It was seared well and was the perfect amount of juicy. The tater tots were yummy although not super memorable (they were basically mashed potatoes within a crunchy shell). The sauteed spinach was good but maybe could use a few more flavors. The lobster Mac n cheese was perfect - just the right amount of lobster in the nice cheesy macaroni.   We also had a bottle of cabernet which wasn't super impressive for what we paid ($95) but was good.   However, the star of the show - weirdly enough - was the salad. We ordered the chopped vegetable salad and it was absolutely perfect. It had nice crunchy veggies like peppers and cucumbers, and it also had olives, a few grapes (random I know but it worked), and asparagus. All of it was tossed in a wonderful, light balsamic that added the perfect flavoring. I'm seriously still raving about this salad the next day. It was wonderful.   Overall, it was a great meal. The ambience was fun too, with lots of pop songs and great people watching. Our server was sweet and attentive. My only complaint is that the table we were seated at had a booth that was super far away and I had to have my back bent at an unnatural angle for most of the meal because we were so far away. Other than that, perfect dinner and I'm looking forward to going there again!",

Oysters, baby scallop ceviche (excellent) and king crab with large shrimp. Also try the Wagyu sliders, hard to beat.   Followed that up with the beef tenderloin filet and KILLER Mac & cheese. Perfectly done to order. My wife had the fish special of the evening which was also perpaired to perfection. Now desert. #1 here is the donuts. Oh my goodness.....most likely the best donut we have ever had. Glazed sweet potato donuts with crushed nuts.  Yes, this was an expensive evening. I knew that going in, I have been there before. The only thing that can ruin an expensive experience like this  is poor food, lousy service, and poor attitude. You will not find any of that here. Super service (Sean), super attentive to your table, killer food, and very friendly  management.   Personally, worth every penny.",

    "text": "On the evening of May 5, 2016, I visited STK for the 3rd straight year in the month of May as I travel to Las Vegas for the Interop Trade Show.   As usual, the ambiance was on point, music had the mood set perfectly, it was Cinco de Mayo (which typically I do not celebrate) but what can I say? It was a great day - until my food arrived.  I ordered a Filet Mignon prepared Medium Cajun Style (which adds Cajun Rub on top). Medium is a Pink Warm Center. When the food arrived, I added some sides to it, Confit Potatoes our waitress recommended and asparagus. I tasted the sides on my plate. They were really good. I cut into the Filet. It unfortunately was prepared Medium Well Plus. The waitress understood and replaced the overcooked steak with a Medium prepared Filet Mignon about 6 minutes after I reported the issue.   The replacement Filet Mignon arrived perfectly prepared on an empty plate. Gone were the sides I had on the plate. I proceeded to eat the remainder sides left from the table that were somewhat on the chilly side as they had been sitting. I enjoyed the steak and my somewhat chilly sides and kept it moving.  It was a total of 5 Men in our party. 2 White, 1 Mexican, 1 Asian, and I am Black. A diverse crowd - in a good mood because we were scheduled to go to Spearmint Rhino afterwards (Holla!)  Anyhow, we ordered dessert after eating. We ordered the doughnuts with candied walnuts and caramel sauce. It tasted like a gourmet crispy creme without the frosting. It was one of the best desserts I had eaten.  So why the Meh review? Here's why.  1) I had sides on my plate prior to cutting into my overcooked Filet. Those sides never made it back to my plate with the freshly prepared replacement Filet.  2) The dessert, when presented to us, did not have new silverware. We all received eating dishes and ended up using the same silverware we used for our meals. The dessert was served with no silverware to serve. It also was presented with thick whipped cream that if you turned upside down, did not fall out of its dish. With contaminated silverware from our meals, we could not dip into the whipped cream. We also dug into the doughnuts cautiously since our silverware was not new. We dealt with it.   3) The next table over with 5 couples (10 people) ordered 2 of the same dessert we had. They all received eating dishes and spoons. I thought to myself, here we go.  4) I raised awareness to our server regarding my sides being eliminated from my overcooked Filet plate and the lack of silverware for the dessert.   4a) the waitress indicated that due to food code, food cannot be transferred. I thought great! So why not transfer my sides to a dish at the table until their overcooked food is replaced? She then added, I should have brought out more sides. I thought to myself, Yeah! You Should Have!   4b) the waitress argued with me that the table that received the desserts did not have serving silverware with the doughnuts. I pointed out okay but each person had new silverware (spoons) to use. After which, I stood up and pointed at the table and their new silverware. It took me to do this for her to agree with me.  The waitress did not deduct ANYTHING off of the $570 bill we accumulated. She indicated that she would educate the servers that brought out the dessert and educate the crew that cleared the entree meals.  Wow.. And sarcastically, Good Job.   I'll go somewhere else to dine next time. Our client expensed the full bill. I paid $0 and I was dissatisfied. That tells you the service was less than sub-par.  My name is Theron. My nickname is Via I give legit reviews from my life experiences..  * If a representative from STK wishes to contact me, I can be reached at Seven-One-Four / Six-One-Five -- Seven-Four-Six-Six.  ** If I am not contacted, I will be mailing STK a copy of this on stationary letterhead.",

    "text": "Tourists: Come one, come all! If you're looking for a hip, contemporary spot to grab a nice dinner before a night out in the town. Then this is your spot to grab your girls or fellas and come out for your not so usual loud, music bumping dinner to get yourself hyped to go paint the town red. Couples order room service or go to Scarpettas at Cosmo for the romantic feel. I highly recommend this place for some good eats with a group to set the mood for the night. Perhaps even, a great way to unwind from a long day at the convention with your mentors! Every STK has their own DJ in the mix to set the tone!   I came here with a group of 8 for a friends birthday on a weekday. Ive always seen this place around however never really had the desire to come. Like I noted above its great for groups and definitely not your old fashion kind of steakhouse. I'm not sure what fell through the cracks with my experience but for our $1100 tab I expected a bit more. More customer superior customer service, more flavor even if it meant more $. It could've been the server who wasn't as enthusiastic and accommodating as the $160+ added on gratuity he was granted hence the size of our party. On to the more Yelp appropriate opinions, the food was mediocre. I never pass up Mac n Cheese with lobster from any almost any where but the cheese here was equivalent to box made Kraft Mac & Cheese and well I'm more of a Velveeta type of girl if we're talking box Mac & Cheese. It was gross and of course hardly any chucks of lobster. The steak was made to perfection and I wish I would've tried a couple different sauces or rubs for the lovely charge of $2 but passed it up. The Yukon mashed potatoes were \"basic\". The pot pie mushrooms were delicious. We order 5 appetizers and they all were bland. Steer away from the shrimp ceviche and beef tartare and beef carpaccio but do order the lobster tail and bite size oysters! Overall, it was just average! Maybe for another birthday or event I'll try it out again... Just maybe.  P.S.  I heard the sweet potato donuts here with Nutella are out of this world. They were out last night so I can't confirm or deny it. I might have to come for that too and the bread was something to rave about.",

For a restaurant that was named after steak, I was a little disappointed with mine, because I thought it was over cooked for medium rare, however it was still tasty and tender. Our waitress was awesome. She never made us feel rushed and checked on us frequently. I know I could have sent the steak back, but it wasn't a big deal. I ordered the side of wild mushrooms and they were really great!! I also tasted a friend's delicious mac and cheese which was definitely shareable for two bc it was so rich. Another girl ordered the truffle fries which weren't great. The texture was off, it almost reminded me of yuca fries. I wouldn't say this is a shareable side either. I also think we had almost every dessert on the menu. Everything was good but extremely sweet.",

    "text": "Such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to Vegas.  I wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday dinner and this was perfect.  PARKING: It's located in Cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  If you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.  ATMOSPHERE: The inside is dark and trendy.  With hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  I made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to the club early and it was slightly crowded, but I'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  It was perfect for a fancy birthday dinner.  We got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  For attire I could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  You can't be overdressed here.  I heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the dinner experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  I think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.    FOOD:   STEAK - Their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak I wouldn't come here.  My suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  My boyfriend and I shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  The steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 each!) We got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  Beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  You can get \"toppings\" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  The steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.  SIDES - Truffle mac n cheese - The mac was the round short pastas usually in macaroni salad and I really liked that.  A good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.  Truffle parmesan fries - They are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  They are stacked like Jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. They were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.  Mushroom pot pie - A weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and a creamy sauce inside.  It tasted like truffle but I don't even know if it had truffle.  The top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.  Bok Choy - Weird for a steak place but it was kinda spicy.  Very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  Not bad actually for some greens.  Overall very impressed with STK.  I thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! They even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with a candle :)",

Cool vibe, with a DJ positioned in the middle of the restaurant cutting some good tunes from the 70's-present. Music was louder than avg, but not overbearing.   This was stop #2 of our foodie tour of Cosmo, so we were planning on a cocktail maybe, and an appetizer or two. We settled on the Lil BRG sliders and a side of their Jalepeno Cheese Grits. Both were great. The sliders had excellent flavoring with a nice sauce. The star was the grits rhough. Phenomenal with just a hint of jalapeno. Also, be sure to get a loaf of their complementary garlic bread - awesome!  We were tempted to order an entre, but were saving room for the best dessert in Las Vegas served next door at DOCG - the Caramel Budino.",

However, when I went to the host, she was able to seat us right away.  The decor is modern and its lively.  Loud music which is what we were all in the mood for.  The waiter was super friendly and got us cocktails and red wine right away.    Bonus, bathroom attendant was super nice and I realized I had forgotten my chapstick and he gave me a new one right away.  Nice!  For an appetizer, I had raw oysters and for dinner I had the filet medallion cooked medium rare.  I've had better oysters, but they were fine in the moment.  As for my steak, it was cooked correctly and exactly what I was looking for.  My husband, on the other hand, was disappointed in his steak.  He didn't think the quality was up to par.  I thought everything was fine...  So why the 2 star review?  My friend and I exclusively ate the raw oysters and we both got sick the next day.  I eat raw oysters often, so this is a rare event for me to get sick.  Fortunately, it was nothing serious, but its disappointing.  It was a fun, lively dinner.",

I would given 2 stars, but our server was really on top of it, so I'm giving it 3.  $49 for a ribeye, I would hope that it would be tender, but it was really grainy and hard to cut into. My husband's first ribeye was half fat!  But the server noticed right away as he cut into it, and without hesitation took it back and got him a new one. The highlight of my dish was the foie gras that was on top of my filet.  I'm from California and foie is banned here, so I was excited to find a place that served it.  I know it's cruel, but if you missed my point of \"we eat a lot of steaks\", you can take it that I'm a True carnivore!  I would go ahead and skip this place, but it's good for drinks and lounging with friends.  They have a dj here nightly and depending on the night, they play good music.  They have \"magnum mondays\" like Marquis, where you buy a bottle and they bring you the Costco size!",

    "text": "My first experience with STK was at the NYC location, and I was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an STK to my current digs in Los Angeles -- a city that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that lack culinary inspiration. Suffices to say I was less than shocked when I heard the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas would also feature an STK restaurant.   My experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. The NYC location boasted good food and a classy atmosphere in the Meatpacking District (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (I moved out of NYC shortly after it opened so I wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). While the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. I'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from Texas.   When the Los Angeles restaurant opened, I was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \"trendiness\" quickly declined within its first year. STK LA's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other LA nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off.   Fast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in Vegas, the Cosmopolitan, now boasts its very own STK. A group of us made up of my closest friends from Texas, New York and California were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out STK. I tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. Getting a reservation was easy enough -- I called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. Our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. Disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you.   45 minutes later, we were seated and STARVING. This is when things got exponentially better. Our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. Throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as a celebratory dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. Crisis averted. Be sure to request Raquel M. as your server -- Raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. The restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet the chef, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. The kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly.   The giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (I'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were actually better than the ones I had at the NYC and LA locations. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and the cut and flavor were excellent. Still not on par with Texas steaks, but as far as the STK chain goes, I really enjoyed my meal.  Net/net, while the steaks at STK restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the Las Vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. If you are staying at the Cosmopolitan and/or looking for a fun/trendy place to eat before you head to Marquee, this is the place to go.",

I selected this restaurant because I'm always reading about it on Twitter or Us Mag, etc., and maybe I would get lucky and see a celebrity.  LOL.  Anyhow, we had an early reservation before our Vegas show.  When we got to the Cosmopolitan hotel, we had to go up 3 levels on escalators to get there.  I just felt that the restaurant was part of a mall... not the hotel.  It was kind of awkward seeing all the other restaurants on the same floor, like a Food Court!  We were seated right away and served the baked bread with blue cheese butter and chive oil.  I wasn't a fan but it was okay.  I think its more of an acquired taste.  Our waiter was very nice and gave good recommendations.  We ordered the caesar salad (it's standard for us), which was good.  I had the Filet Medallions and my husband ordered the Skirt Steak with a side of Mac and Cheese (good) and the Mushroom Pot Pie (excellent)!  The dinner was okay, not to die for or anything.  By this time the restaurant was definitely filling up with parties, bachelorette parties, etc., so it was fun to people watch. It was a cool restaurant but I wouldn't rave about the food, its more about the ambiance IMO.",

To the restaurant's credit we did not have to wait and we're immediately seated.  the problem was a very strong vomit odor at our table.  All four of us could smell it.  They moved us to another table, but smelling someone's barf was not such a great way to start the evening.  I ordered lobster, two others ordered fish and the entrees were excellent.  My Hamachi appetizer was also excellent and so were the other's salads.  The fourth person in our party ordered a rib eye steak and it was tough and difficult to chew.  To the restaurant's credit, they took the rib eye off the bill with no charge.  The only other negative is that everything is extremely expensive, which is OK, if you don't have to smell barf and get excellent service with excellent food.  So a few negatives, but mostly positive.  Might try it again.",

I have this guilty feeling that I'm missing out on something, however this time around, I'm genuinely pissed at myself.  STK is perfect for a late meal before clubbing, or for a lively group of people that don't mind eating dinner in a loud atmosphere. We walk in and the place was jamming. They had a DJ spinning AWESOME 90's R&B and Rap and all the servers were on their A game. The food was fresh, delicious and came out promptly - but not so fast where you think it's not being cooked for you.  The coolest part about STK is going to the kitchen and seeing the chef's line with their amazing view. The chefs are having just as much fun as all of the guests. I'd highly recommend STK and will absolutely be visiting my next time in Vegas.",

The music being played parallels that of the clubs in the vicinity. The interior and the decor of the restaurant itself was modern and chic.   The menu offered a variety of choices all depending on your appetite. The filets (7 oz. & 10 oz.) were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. We ordered the mac & cheese and yukon potatoes as side dishes and were not disappointed with either. I recommend those sides over some of the others, especially the broccolini. The table next to us ordered it and it looked weak. Skip on an appetizer and snack on their great with chive olive oil. It was a pleasant surprise.  Dessert is not to be skipped. Their bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream, covered with Captain Crunch was a perfect end to the meal...and I'm not even a fan of bread pudding.  FYI the busboys and waiter worked their asses off throughout the meal.   The not so good...  They have a MASSIVE wine menu. The type that will make you wish you had a Cliff Notes version of it. The wine list was not the issue, their lack of quality beer was. Their offerings included the usual watery light beers and my choice for the night Sam Adams Boston Lager. I have nothing against Sam, I actually enjoy it very much so, but I was underwhelmed with the lack of attention the beer selection received in their menu. Craft beer is turning into what wine was years back and I was surprised their menu did not convey that.  The bathroom situation isn't ideal. It is a one-at-a-time procedure and the unisex line can get crowded. The bathroom hall monitor loudly lets you know when someone has left the bathroom in case you happened to slip out of consciousness and need assistance.  Bottom line, will I eat there again when in Las Vegas? Answer, yes.",

    "text": "BEST DINNING EXPERIENCE EVER !! Came here for my girlfriends birthday and had the best time. We had the tuna tartare and the King crab legs to start. For entrees, the porterhouse and filet bone-in steaks with Mac and cheese, Brussels sprout and truffle fries for sides. Absolutely flawless!! You can order different sauces and butters to put on the steaks too. JEREMEY, our server, took it above and beyond with shots on the house . 2 rounds !! So friendly and knowledgable of the menu! For dessert we had the sweet potato donuts with pecans. So incredibly good :))) can't wait to come back for more !! Thanks again Jeremy!!! And STK LAS VEGAS team.",

    "text": "CAme here after the Magic show and I thoroughly enjoyed myself! It felt more like a bar than a restaurant with music blasting but I didn't mind because hey... its freaken Vegas!   We had the pear endive salad, beef tartare, bone in filet, and a few sides that I cant really recall. I'm not usually a big meat person but the bone in filet was melt in your mouth goodness!!! The pinot noir (forget the name) was excellent and the service was top notch. My water was never empty and the busboys came around often to check up on us. I was very happy with the service as I never had to call over the waiter for anything (def adds a star).   Even though I had steak the night before and wasn't too excited about STK the following day, it definitely blew the previous night's dinner away. I would recomment if you are taking in easy and aren't planning to party after. Trust me.... you will get food coma and since it's trendy and lively, you won't feel like such a loser going to sleep before 12 :)",

The truffle fries were so good. The italian meat appetizer was delish to. The steaks were cooked right as well. The DJ played some fun tunes. Has a loud club type feel yet thats part of its charm. If you want quiet its not for you. But if you want a racous uptempo glamour type of nite i highly recommend STK!",

It was incredibly loud but you are  dining at a nightclub--- what should one expect.... The music is loud and its obvious that this is where one should go if they want to be scene ie; they have a photographer taking pictures of different tables/ groups around the venue. Music is a good mix of mashups and top 40.   Service is really good-- no complaints.   We ordered the beef tartare, carpaccio, and iceburg salad to start and then filets for dinner. The meat was delicious--- The pesto pasta with the carpaccio was amazing!   I wouldn't recommend bringing a date to this place unless you are trying to get wild.....",

    "text": "Ok bachelorette party night #2, we went to STK. This was much more fun than the prior evening. Partly because the restaurant was located in the convenience of our hotel, the Cosmo. Atmosphere was tame, noone was obviously drunk or falling out of their seat. The night was off to a good start. All of the waitstaff were gorgeous, including our busboy, who got shamelessly hit on by several of the girls at our table. No not me. I was focused on the food, which was amazing. Our server was prompt with our drink orders and complimentary bread for the table (out of this world good!) It had chive butter melted on the side. I ate so much I was not too hungry so only ordered the tuna tartare appetizer and romaine salad. That was the perfect amount of food though and the tuna was awesome. The salad tasted like it had caesar dressing which I love so it was all good. Other favorite dishes at the table were the crab legs and shrimp rice crispies. If I came back I would probably stick with the tuna again but get the pear/walnut salad.",

    "text": "First the good things. The beef tartar and the Serrano ham appetizers were excellent. Really, just awesome. The beef had a good flavor and texture, served with potato chips that were good. The Serrano ham appetizer was also great, soft, tasty, the melons, figs and jam tasted great.  Now the bad things.   Service was spotty - not attentive enough for a place like this. They were friendly but inattentive at times.  The sommelier was more of a wine waiter - not warm and fuzzy at all. Many wines were out of stock, including the three least expensive Cabernet, the wines were brutally overpriced (well over 2x retail), and lists started at very high price points (most over $100). We only ended up with two bottles for the table, they were so so wines and were $80 each, and I've never until now not really enjoyed wines at this price point.  The steak - the can do raw steak just fine apparently, but then they go and cook it, what the heck? They were out of several steaks. The Australian Kobe steaks were priced OK, but I didn't get them (12 oz @ $140). Fillet Mignon was out. Annoying. So I got the porterhouse. The porterhouse on the strip side was not trimmed properly and the meat seemed to come from a bovine weightlifter. The fillet side was very good. But I was upset I couldn't just get fillet, the beef was trimmed wrong, and how un-marbled the strip side was.   Lines at the restrooms, very annoying. There is clearly a problem with this restaurant handling the volume of people and their restroom needs. Build more restrooms.  Extremely loud. The DJ, the moron he is, didn't use headphones, so the volume just kept creeping up, it was at club level noises by the end. Screaming was needed to have a conversation. Who is the restaurant manager here, some idiot - I mean, I'm supposed to spend $140 on a steak and eat it 12 inches from a JBL bass cone thumping at  5 inches of deflection? Seriously?  I was not happy, and felt this place overall had bad value, and the main course was underwhelming and the environment was brutally loud.",

This is the place to go if you want to have a lively, good time while eating dinner. They played Top 40 during our entire dinner and my friends and I danced in our seats while eating. We should have just stayed at STK all night instead of trying to get in to Marquee (what a waste of time, by the way.) Our server was completely on top of it and very accommodating as I'm sure we were a little bit difficult to handle being a party of 8 and drinking. The food was also great. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were all very good. I loved the ambiance and my boyfriend even said that he felt like he was on Gossip Girl, Las Vegas edition and that it was the best looking crowd he's ever seen.",

I split it with my friend and it was just the right portion. I had a \"MMMMMM\" moment. oh yes...I did. Mac and cheese: Good, nothing special. Cream spinach: same comment as above Mashed potatoes: fluffy, buttery potato heaven. Try it with their signature steak sauce. MMM. If you want a quiet, intimate dinner, then go somewhere else because it gets loud. We went at 5:30 so it was just perfect but by the time we were leaving the music/noise level went up a couple of notches. Hostesses are hoochified in their litto black dresses and heels.",

It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. The food was great, no complaints but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left, not one said good bye. Horribly stuck up staff, even though the food was great, my husband and I will never be back. We are well dressed and always tip at least 20%.

The bar scene in the center is very stylish, with great DJ spinning good music in the background, and yet the tables are set at a comfortable distance allowing for private conversations, STK is such energetic steakhouse fit for great food as well as people watching. I just love the vibe of this place!  The Green intensity martini is exicting, spicy and refreshing. The tuna tartar was really yummy, especially love the chili oil on the side, really brings out the flavor of the tuna. The baked bread with blue cheese butter was one of the best bread i have tasted in any restaurants, so innovative! The filet medallion was done just right, i savored every bite of it. The chimichurri sauce on the side was excellent.   Parmesan truffle fries was good, but didn't really tasted the truffle.  This is the kind of place you would want to return again and again~",

If you're not going to finish the entire piece (it's a big 14 ouncer, ladies), then start closest to the bone.  It's the most delicious part.  The truffle oil french fries were to die for... and if I were having my last meal, I would order the sliders.  The dirty bird (their version of a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives) was the best martini I've had outside of Gibson's.  The atmosphere is hip and loud, so this may not be the place for you if you like a string quartet with your meal.  However, it's a great time and if you're young (or at least young at heart) and hip, this is the spot for you.  As the advertisement warns, \"this ain't your daddy's steak house.\"",

My wife and I waited and waited and waited as we wanted a cocktail before our dinner reservation just to get the evening under way. Finally a wait person noticed us and it wasn't all that busy. The Gin Fizz eventually showed. It was fantastic and with cucumbers too. Exactly as depicted and delicious. I asked a passing waiter if the music was muted below ear splitting and annoying in the dining area? He said it's not really loud. Apparently he didn't hear my question!!!! We eventually entered the dining area and I ordered the Bone in Filet with Mac & Cheese, mushroom pie, asparagus after a soft shell crab salad which my wife and I split. She ordered the Blue Tuna seared. All very very delicious. The Sommelier was perfect and on top of his game as was the wait person. Unfortunately we will never eat here again and cannot recommend unless you already have perforated ear drums and enjoy Alka Seltzer as an after dinner drink to cure a headache!!! Oh, the music choices were incredibly good as I am most appreciative of the mix it's just that even upon complaint that the noise level was so loud, as did others in the restaurant, the manager declared that that is the theme! So, screw the patrons and stick with The Program you moron. Nobody said turn off the music just lower it to where you aren't brain damaged as the manager apparently is!!",

We both ordered a filet medium rare with au poivre and blue butter sauce. We shared the Yukon gold potatoes and Mac and cheese. It was all delicious. The atmosphere was fun, there was an older group of guys at the table next to us that mingled with a older group of women celebrating a 40th birthday. As the night progressed the table of men and women ended up sitting together and started dancing in the middle of the restaurant. It was fun to people watch. The servers were professional and attentive. The restaurant had a DJ playing music that made it fun. The location is inside the Cosmopolitan which makes the walk to STK entertaining. The Cosmo is gorgeous. STK was memorable and delicious. I would recommend this place to others. The crowd this night was in the 30-40 age range.",

For the last 20 minutes every time we've followed up on our reservation were told that we're the next table to be seated. Im assuming The dessert here better be off the chart which is why this place can't turn a table. More to follow...maybe. Thanks STK fir the wonderful Valentines Day memories.",

The service was alright; at certain points, our waiter did seem rather put off at having to explain certain items on the menu.  I was excited about the foie gras French toast, however I wasn't too impressed with the quality of the foie and the dish didn't work for me.  My fillet was well cooked, but nothing spectacular especially given the price.  The Parmesan truffle fries were unfortunately undercooked: somewhat crispy on the outside but still raw on the inside?!?  However, the place does get 1 star for playing 70s-80s music and avoiding the need to play Top 100 music!  The decor was cool and modern, but certainly didn't make up for the food and service.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW: (marked down to 3 stars).  We had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go back a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  The experience was not as great.  Here is the low down:  HOST STAFF:  Clueless. We made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  On the night of our dinner we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  Uh, seat us maybe?  We gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got approached about our table (except for the wrong name - \"Are you Mr. Kluss\"?) and so we had to go back up to the stand to find out what was going on with the delay.  The hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  When they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  When we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  Not a good tee-off to a $260 dinner for 3.  DINNER: Too slow and with mistakes. The best part of dinner was the demeanor from or original server.  She was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  I'm no stranger to fine dining and a slow pace is nice but It took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  Overall the food was just \"okay\" for as long as we waited and for the price.  I've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (The Palm @ Caesars, Capital Grill, Ruths Chris's, Del Friscos, Flemings etc).  Really surprised too that the cocktails were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is a cocktail?  It was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.  SUMMARY: Like the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  As native Las Vegans we like the Cosmo a lot as far as hotels go and may give STK another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  The layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.  Caveat emptor.",

We are locals and wanted to try this place for our Anniversary but I guess we weren't kewl or important enough to get a reservation as STK has taking itself off the available to the public stage and only made available to the so called elite (not that they would know who that should truly include). I am grateful to Yelp and the Open Table reviews in concert with my experience of their attitude toward locals, I know now I am not missing anything but a hyped up empty experience with so-so food & a ridiculous atmosphere. It's a True shame for such a beautiful hotel as the Cosmopolitan to be home of what is such a rude & unfriendly restaurant on the Strip. Looking forward to the closure and replacement of STK.",

When we initially came in to ask if they have any available seats, the hostesses at the front didn't seem to care and told us no, but when we were walking away one of the male managers rushed to us to say they have available seats by the bar if we're ok with that, which we were.  Food here was great, the medium rare steaks my wife and I ordered were cooked perfectly and so was the foie gras that came with it.  Service was pretty fast, the staff were great, sometimes they were a little TOO attentive, but if you don't mind that and just want good food, then it's worth going",

Promptly sat and served with our drinks.  We ordered the burrata, ceviche and bread to start off the dinner. Burrata was amazing and tasted fresh. Bread was good but wasn't memorable. The ceviche was a disaster, it tasted odd and shrimpy.  For the main course, I ordered a filet mignon, medium rare with lobster and asparagus. Ok, the steak was delicious but for the price, it's really over priced but hey, it's the strip. That's what you get.  For the dessert, donuts!!! There were 6 of us and only two people ate the donuts. We love sweets!  Bottom line, the service was very top notch but for the price of the food, you can definitely find the same menu elsewhere away from the strip.",

We shared the short ribs, 6oz filet, Mac n cheese and sauteed spinach. Everything was really good but the short ribs were seasoned/tender and lets just say they're still on my mind.

    "text": "Very underwhelming experience considering all the options nearby.  I don't mind paying top dollar for steak as long as the restaurant can deliver.  I've been on a conquest to try every steakhouse on the strip over the last few years.  I was excited to try STK given all of Cosmopolitan's amazing food options.  Unfortunately I came away disappointed and eventually ripped off.  I ordered the 14 oz dry aged Delmonico topped with truffle butter with a side of lobster mac.  The wife got the lamb chops.  Frankly the steak was nothing more than basic and the lobster mac was overpriced considering that it was just velveeta mix with small portions of lobster.  Couldn't tell if the wife enjoyed her chops but STK's chops only come with two medallions for those who may be interested.  Now for the kicker.  On food alone STK would have qualified for a 2 star review but I was shocked when I realized I was ripped off by an additional unauthorized $100 tip on top of my normal default tip of 20% of the bill.  Luckily I randomly decided to look over my weekend charges and noticed when I read my hotel invoice.  Had to call in and dispute to get my money back. Consider it a lesson learned, always read your statements folks and prevent yourselves from being scammed by places like STK.  Save yourselves the headache and disappointment plenty of great steakhouses nearby STK is not even inside my top 10.",

I ended up at this steak house super late with a friend of mine, about an hour before closing and they were able to get us a table for two.   We asked for a 10 oz bone in filet which they didn't have an our hostess recommended we get the 8 oz instead. Now, to the two of us, this wasn't a big deal at all, we're here at closing time, whatever. But the hostess proceeded to give us 4 shots on the house along with dessert. Again, not a big deal but she went above and beyond and I really appreciated that.  The food was amazing, I really loved the shrimp cocktail.

We decided to dine family style and ordered:  Lobster Mac - absolutely delicious, rich and decadent! Cheese sauce consistency and flavor was perfect and worked well with the sweet pieces of lobster. Oysters on Half Shell - fresh and sweet tasting oysters, a bit on the small side but shucked well, no shell remnants in the oysters and served with mignonette, cocktail sauce, lemons and tiny bottles of Tabasco Burrata - comes with heirlooms tomatoes, basil pesto and drizzled with aged balsamic. Great burrata, this was a hit amongst the girls. Beef Tartare - made with capers, whole grain dijon, topped with quail egg and served with truffled croutons. This tartare was lackluster in comparison to the amazing beef tartare we had the previous night at Bazaar Meats Cowboy Steak - The steak was good, but not as good as I had expected based on our previous experience at Bazaar Meats by Jose Andres. The steak, although, large in portion and heft in price was a bit of a letdown. It was good, but not worth the price we paid. It was a pretty fatty cut of steak, with some portions a bit too gristly for our taste. The parts without the gristle tasted good and was cooked to our liking and was tender. Roasted Dover Sole - a simply, roasted Dover sole with brown butter sauce, lemon and served with fingerling potatoes. Boring, typical and not worth ordering. Found this dish almost bland and boring, with a possibility of being very able to cook this dish at home.  Service was good and friendly. They were also super sweet and gave the birthday girl a little birthday cake before taking off!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I casually meander by STK often and finally I found myself inside sitting at a table. Service was prompt and friendly. Food was delicious and semi-creative, for a steakhouse. (I'm looking at you jalapeno grits.)   We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation and grabbed some wine at the bar. I don't know why I was shocked at the prices given the location, but I still was. The markup here is downright awful. So if you want to imbibe, be prepared to pay a very high bill. Food was the typical high-end steakhouse on the strip pricing. Although, I did not feel as taken advantage of as I did with the drinks.  I ordered the Market Fish which was risotto with sea scallops topped with caviar (bougie, I know.) Along with that we ordered a few sides, a necessary evil. We got the mac & cheese (which can be prepared truffled or with lobster), the jalapeno grits, and the broccolini. All were good decisions. The jalapeno grits stood out to me as being the most original AND delicious. If I could eat a trendy, mini-cast iron of them every night, I'd be living the dream. My entree was decadent and rich. I ALWAYS order scallops if offered to me and I was not let down. Sadly they aren't a permanent item on the menu, although I think they should be.   I docked a star for the alcohol prices, but mainly for the environment. WARNING: Grandma rant. It was way too loud. Now, I understand that we are on the strip, and it's evening, but it's a Tuesday night. Get it together. If it were the weekend, or even a Thursday I would understand the club-vibe. But after a half hour of screaming across the table at my husband, I had to give up. Everything else about this place was spot on.",

Sides:  Lobster mac and cheese - delicious although one of the girls thought it was regular mac (not enough lobster ?) Sauteed spinach - for the sake of greens Creamed corn - a bit too sweet  In a nutshell, they kill it with the steak, the sides are pretty standard, come here for the ambience!",

A tip: you want to sit toward the back of the restaurant because it's beautiful back there. Last time we were at the back of the restaurant and I loved it. This time, the they sat us toward the front of the restaurant and I just was not as impressed.  The service is very good. That is where this restaurant does well. We had a nice waiter but it was the other people helping with water as well as with cleaning up the table that were outstanding. The restaurant is expensive. My favorite part of my meal was ordering the beet salad at the beginning. Quite frankly, next time, I would only order that. It was a large salad and it was absolutely delicious. I shared it with my group. From there, I ordered the 10 ounce filet mignon which was expensive. The problem is that it was harder than great filet mignon should be. It was not as moist or tender as I've had at other restaurants, including a top restaurant in Pahrump Nevada that does a way better job. Great filet mignon should 'melt in your mouth' and this was not the case. Three of us ordered it and all of us were disappointed. I did order a side of broccolini I which was good. My friend ordered asparagus but did not like a vinegar thickened light sauce on top of it. The Mac and cheese was ok.  My friend and I ordered a glass of Malbec each which was very good. Our other friend ordered orange juice which was not that good and tasted like it was watered down. It is an expensive restaurant and therefore I expect a lot more than what I got. The food quality is just OK despite good service and I would probably not come back. We chose not to have dessert here and instead went downstairs to another place at The Cosmopolitan that is very good for dessert. I don't know if I really want to come back here unless somebody pays because I was that underwhelmed. Compared to other restaurants, as I've said before, this place leaves a lot to be desired.",

STK is a very consistent chain and this is now one of my favorite restaurants in LV.  I started with the shrimp cocktail which consisted of four medium size shrimp with traditional cocktail sauce.  Friends got the burratta and tomato and  beet salad.  Both of those appetizers were really for two people, and are meant to be shared.    I ordered the 10oz filet with a side of bearnaise sauce, while one friend got the dover sole and another the rib eye.  My filet was absolutely perfect and while my steak was medium the friends rib eye was medium rare and both were cooked exactly as they should.  My friend ordered the sweet corn pudding for the table that wasn't my favorite and I would have preferred good old creamed corn.   Their corkage is $50 and our waitress was just excellent.  She was on top of the wine and bottle of champagne we brought in (decanted the red wine and put the champagne on ice).  Couldn't have been a better meal.",

The music is so loud you'll spend your whole night just fake smiling and nodding because you can't hear the person next to you. \"What? What was that?\" will be the entirety of the conversation.   I was mortified when a girl at the table next to us literally got up and attempted to dance on her chair. So awkward. Especially when she stopped dancing and couldn't figure out how to get down. I likened it to that time when you're a kid and climbed too high in a tree and got stuck. Only this poor girl was in a tube dress.

    "text": "After my poor experience several months ago, I decided to have dinner at STK when our Yelp event was cancelled.  I stopped at the host podium and asked if my manner of dress was OK and they seated me immediately.  I was soon greeted by my server, Rachael, who left menus for me to look over while she went to get the iced tea I asked for.  When she returned Rachel told me some specials the chef had that night and I opted for one of those--the ribeye cap--asking for it to be done blue.  I also ordered the hearts of romaine salad.  I received their pull apart bread topped with melted blue cheese and chive flavored oil for dipping.  This is really good but you have to hang on to your bread plate and the bread if you want to have any after starters are out of the way.  When the salad was brought, the runner asked if I wanted some fresh pepper and he got the pepper mill and ground a generous portion for me.  The salad comes with a parmesan lemon dressing and it was very good.  The steak arrived and it was very rare as I had ordered and it was very good.  Plated on a bed of mashed potatoes with mushrooms, the steak was tender and as good as Rachael described it to be.  For dessert, I asked about two items and with Rachael's descriptions, I opted for the STK doughnuts and I'm glad I did.  The doughnuts are coated with a maple glaze and having candied pecans.  Service was excellent throughout the time I was their with dirty plates removed quickly and any empty sweetener packs were removed quickly too.    It's always good when you can upgrade a business and I'm glad I gave them a second chance.",

But after being sat, I just couldn't stop looking around asking myself... \"Are they playing a joke on us?\"    THE MUSIC IS UNBEARABLY LOUD!  We thought it might just be at the front, or the bar area. Nope!  We were sat towards the back and I just couldn't believe it. Again, I get it... It's Vegas, they want the young \"see and be seen\" attitude, but when I can't hear my gf who is inches away, or our server for that matter (until he started yelling to us which was awkward).  I didn't bother asking why the music was so loud, I'm sure they get that often.   The food was good. Had 3 appetizers and we each ordered a steak. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, or had in Las Vegas but it was good. Steak grade maybe a 6 out of 10.    Our table was kind of awkward as well. It was only the 2 of us so you almost have to share a curvy booth with strangers. The table next to us seemed annoyed as well. Maybe this is why the music is so loud, so we don't listen to one another's convo?  Maybe it's so that we eat and go... Thus, they can turn more tables?    Afraid to say, this is a \"NO GO BACKER\" for me. The food... Maybe but the music being so loud I don't ever want to stand while trying to enjoy a nice meal.   Tab was ~$320 for 2 people. 3 apps, 1 martini and 2 steaks (not Kobe).   I tipped $30%.",

The price we paid per person was so insane for the food quality and taste (fish was not edible and the chicken was so plain.  The steak was the best of the three). The music they played was great (and loud so expect a loud atmosphere).  I would NOT recommend this restaurant for a large party when there are so many other incredible Vegas places to eat.",

You can turn the music as quiet (so you can talk) or as loud (so you can dance - and we danced up a storm) as you want. Needless to say there was a lot of wine and possibly some dancing on the table. It is Vegas after all and this was the ultimate Vegas experience.   The service is great as always and it was a really fun way to enjoy a big group. And it's not as crazy expensive as you would think.   The Seafood sampler - the oysters and crab legs are great. Try the Parmesan fries. And although I didn't try I've heard the pork belly is great.  I got the kurobuta double pork chop and it was wonderful just like everything else. Who doesn't love bacon with their pork chop ;)  We opted out of dessert because we had so much food.

How could my steak be a disappointment!!?! :( BUT, everything else I ate was delicious and service was mostly on point.  What to Love: _DJ keeps the party going. Ever fear that your day buzz will die at a nice Vegas dinner? STK DJ keeps it going with an awesome playlist. _Our server was a delight. We had to be out at a certain time to get to a show and he was on point with the timing. Also very friendly and helpful with a large group. We also had to do one separate bill and it was handled seamlessly. _Food: Scallops and Steak Tartare we DELICIOUS. As were the Kushi oysters. They tend to be one of my favs anyway and the quality here was fantastic.  What could be better: _Despite a reservation and our entire group arriving we still had to stand around for 5 minutes. With 11 people in our reso it crowded the bar area since many other parties had to pass by us and clearly there were many empty tables around us. It made for an awkward start to the evening as you then also had 11 people trying to order drinks at the bar. _My filet :( Now, granted, I was eating a mountain of other appetizers with others, so I opted to split the 6oz filet with a friend so I could save room for drinks. When my filet arrived it definitely was not medium rare. They very handily split it for us, but my guess is it sat under a warmer for a bit while other food was finishing and thus overcooked/dried out which happened quickly since it wa sonly 6oz and it was cut in half. Normally if my steak arrives overdone I would bring it up to the server, but since we were on a time crunch I didn't have time to send it back.  I hope to make it back again so I can give the steak another chance!",

I ended up going for a business dinner and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.  Pros *The appetizers were amazing.  Hands down.  Everything we ordered was fantastic and they actually gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but I'll give them the point) *The music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  It was not what you normally hear at a club or a restaurant so it was a fun change of pace *The drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty *The steak!  I know!  I said it.  It was a pretty good steak.  I only had a few bites of someone else's but it was the complete opposite of where my mind goes when I think about steak.  So far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  But that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  Every cloud has its silver lining, and at STK there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.  Cons *The volume of the music is insane.  It started out manageable but we were basically shouting at each other by the time we left *The drink I ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average *The sides were hit or miss.  Asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  The gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting *The service.  Our waiter was great.  Friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  Unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  Instead we ended up with a loitering busser.    As I mentioned earlier, this was a business dinner.  We were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  I guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  Every time we said no and he just slipped to the side and waited there.  It was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.  So we've finished our entrees.  We ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  We're winding our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  I assumed that he was there to just say thank you since I'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  Turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  He said the restaurant was at capacity and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.  I'm sure there are people in Vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at capacity, but I can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  I've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  If you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  It was really poor form that the manager asked us to vacate the table (after the check had been paid, mind you).  Overall I am disappointed with STK.  I went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  Turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired.",

Played a bit of everything which is nice when your enjoying a drink and food before the night really begins.  Had the free range chicken and it was perfect.  Succulent and not dry.  Tried the \"Smell The Roses\" and it's  very refreshing.  Hendricks, rose syrup, lemon, and Honey.  Service was on par but wouldn't expect less in Vegas. Lol",

We were all served entrees at exactly the same time and every steak was perfect but 1.  Rob took it away and was back with a perfectly cooked steak in less than a minute.  The service, food, drinks, and atmosphere were all perfect.  We will be back!",

Arrived early and sat at the bar. Had an exquisitely expensive cocktail with gin and elderflower, roughly equivalent to two weeks allowance in 1991, and the bubbles went promptly to my head.  Sat for dinner and had excellent salad, excellent wine, and excellent steak. All of this is to be expected at this price, but here's where STK is cooler than say, Mortons, or even Cut.  1. Our server was out of this world. She was thorough without being patronizing, warm without seeming fake, and attentive without being obtrusive. She had a flair for the dramatic and I was mesmerized as I watched her gesticulate seductively through the specials. She had a twinkle in her eye. It was charming beyond belief.  2. The vibe was young and fun. They had a DJ spinning 90s music and it created an ambiance of energy and excitement. When I was done eating here, instead of being all, \"Oh gross, I'm stuffed and tired. When do I sleep?, I was like \"Where to next?\"",

It is very noisy.. super load music.    Bread with blue cheese butter and chive oil - 4.5 stars - really enjoyed this dish.  Large load of bread crisp on the outside but very soft in the inside.  Just a hint if blue cheese flavor in the butter.  Delish!  Cucumber Stiletto - 4 stars - very good fresh light drink! Butternut squash risotto - 4 stars - this dish had a lot of complex flavors. Short rib and risotto was cooked nicely.  The flavors in the sauce on short ribs prevailed over the butternut squash.  The short rib sauce is a veal reduction with red wine and a strong nutmeg finish.   Crab ravioli - 3.5 to 4 stars -pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce was light.  A very delicate dish.  The taste of crab was almost lost. Adding a touch more crab would perfect this dish. Burrata - 3 stars - burrata itself was amazing but bread was too soft and dish would have beed better with fresh tomatoes and olives rather than a tapenade  Corn pudding - 4 stars - super corn delicious!  But I LOVE corn! Bok choy - 3 stars Haricot vert - table said 4 stars.  I didn't try them 1/2 lobster - 4 stars - just slightly over cooked but really ever so slightly Filet w/ bacon butter - 4 stars - this filet was cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested.  Nice and tender. Add Truffles fries - 4.5 stars - I normally do not like thick fries but these were really really good!  Other things ordered at our tables caesar salad, iceberg salad, sole, skirt steak, Brussels sprouts and tuna.  I did not try these dishes but table consensus was salads were very good but Brussels sprouts and entrees were all just ok and no one would order them again.  We ended the night with a fire ball shot (who's idea was that?) and the bread pudding!  The bread pudding is not traditional.  It is more like a cake.. definitely not as dense as normal bread pudding.  I like the captain crunch pieces as the added a little extra something something!  Amy was our server and she was excellent!  Service overall was impressive!  Unfortunately, I probably won't come here again as it is just too noisy and you have to know what to order to really enjoy your meal.  However, if you are a group of singles looking for a good time this is your place!  This seems like a major pick up joint to see and be seen!",

    "text": "This place was very interesting. I went on a Saturday night at 9pm and it was very busy. Upon walking up the music was so loud I almost thought it was a night club. We had to wait about 15 min for a table even with a reservation which was fine because we were not in a hurry. We were finally led to our table but were left there and were told to hold and not sit down as there was some confusion about how many place settings had been put down. I ended up just telling everyone to sit because we all looked stupid just standing there. A server came and removed the extra place settings which was nice and it made things more comfortable. I wish I could say more about our server, but I honestly never heard anything he said as the music was too loud. Literally I didn't hear anything he said ... maybe the specials not sure ... I heard something about several butters??  But I don't know.  There was a DJ preforming and it was so loud ! Tupac, Justin Bieber, Bruno Mars ... just a plethora of different music . It was so loud we couldn't hear anything ! But still thought it was fun. A different women came around and took our order not sure who she was ? She was very nice and sweet but I couldn't hear her either lol.  I had the filet medallion it was 6oz and perfectly cooked and was the perfect portion. 2 others got the fillet one said it was \"ok\" the other said it was the best thing he had ate in his life. Granted he was from England and the food is terrible so not sure if he can be trusted lol. I would say it was pretty good. One person said their steak was tough , I kept hearing a lot of \"it was ok\" all night. My sister had a 10oz fillet and she literally could not cut into this thing ! The knife was not sharp I had to sit there and watch her hacking away at this meat like she was Hannibal Lecter \"Hello Clarise\" lol all while \" Despasito\" was burning my ears in the background. The sides were small and 15$ a piece! The sauces on the steak were also extra, but I stick to the idea that if the steak is good it doesn't need sauce. We did get a free dessert and at the end the experience was so strangely unforgettable we couldn't stop taking about it the next day.",

They keep the lighting low, music loud and energy high, making it the perfect place to get the party started!  I started with the Cucumber Stiletto which was crisp and refreshing. We started the meal with the Pear & Endive salad, Tuna Tartare, and a buffalo mozzarella cheese over bread (which they made special for us since we had a vegetarian dining with us that evening). All appitizer dishes exceeded my expectations. I'm not really a fish eater, but I tried the Tuna tartare, and LOVED it!. For the main dishes, my group shared the vegetarian risotto, sea bass over mushroom risotto and loin strip steak. For sides, we got the Corn Pudding, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Everything was excellent. At the end of the meal they came out with a creme brulee with Happy Birthday written on the dish. I loved every minute at STK and I plan to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The creamed spinach was cold. The bread was \"enh.\" Nothing wowed us at a cost of $300.   If you want sexy, hip, and a place where all the beautiful people eat, go here.

I must say, I love this atmosphere compared to other fancy steakhouses I've been to because of the loud music and club like atmostphere. Some may not like that because they want to enjoy their dinner in peace, but I think it adds to the fun of being in Las Vegas, especially if you're eating with a big group of friends. They play a lot of 80's/90's music remixed to dance beats. Sometimes the entire restaurant sings along to the songs.  Their steak ranks as some of the best steaks I've ever had, very tender and full of flavor. I always get my steak with foie gras on top. Their sides are all very good. My favorites are the mushroom pot pie, mac & cheese, cream spinach and creamy yukon potatoes.   If you're lucky, you'll see celebrities from time to time dining here since a lot of them do come here to eat. My last visit, we sat next to B-Real and the rest of Cypress Hill.",

During the middle of our dinner I accidentally spilled water on myself. You would think our server would come over and help but he didn't. It's funny too cause he was literally two tables away from us. All our food was just okay not amazing. Cut and The Strip is way better than this place. Do not waste your time eating here when you're in Vegas. It's a nice place to get a drink before the club but not to have dinner.",

If you want to feel like you are eating dinner inside a nightclubish environment and eating a steak from your neighborhood pub, this is the place. Totally over rated. It's lucky to be inside a nice hotel to be able to get a decent amount of service. My steak was tough, the sides were okay, nothing special. I would not go back here. I give it 2 stars because 1 start means I got a cockroach or hair in my food, 2 means it's edible but I didn't like the food, service, nor environment. Prime at Bellagio is much better. So is Delmonico.",

Everything everyone says about the booth being tight is True, we were very crammed at our table. I don't think our president liked that very much! The music was loud, at the end the night I had lost my voice, and since our customers had thick accents, the music made it difficult to hear them. However, this restaurant is a perfect fit for the Cosmo hotel.   The food was very good. I had the filet medallion. It was cooked perfectly medium. We also had all the sides, and lots of wine! The lobster mac & cheese was by far my fave. So overall - great food, great atmosphere, but there are a few downsides if you are coming for a work meeting with a large group of people.",

    "text": "Good meat.  Not terribly pricey for cuts of meat, but neither a good deal.  Some sides ok (we all dug on the sweet corn, mac and cheese was rather good as well.  Truffle fries kind of pathetic- tater tots, basically; asparagus meh.)  The real shitter- their wine is expensive as hell.  $17 for a glass of Justin Cabernet?  The cheapest bottle of red is $75?  Come on now, that's gouging.    I don't mind dropping money on a quality steakhouse meal, but when the wine is ludicrously overpriced from the get-go, that's hard to overcome.  Because I like enjoying some fine red with my cut of carnivorosity.    Plus, you can think me an old fart at the ripe age of 36, but steakhouses are best (in my opinion) when they are classic, old-school types.  Some Frank or Dean playing in the background, leather booths, gin and tonics before the meal, etc.    Techno music?  Cosmopolitans?  I get it, the Cosmo resort is trying awfully hard for the young hipster vibe, and yes, some of those kids have some serious money to blow.  I guess you need a place like that for \"those people.\"  I had a decent meal, paid way too much for it- mostly due to the wine-, and can cross this place off the list forever as \"not my scene.\"    You kids go have your fun, though.  And then go wait in line and pay $50 for admission into some similar techno-playing club.",

    "text": "I decided to treat my friends I live with to a meal at a good steakhouse here in Vegas well when I tried calling Ramsay's restaurant. They told me they were booked for a week in advance and didn't have the ability to take walk-in guests! So after doing some searching we landed on STK at Cosmo... Upon our arrival we were all surprised at how interesting the interior was and it was nice and quiet when we got there....  After ordering our drinks the music started blasting and I couldn't hear anyone at my table! I asked the waiter if this was normal and he said yes I didn't like that so I took a star off for it this wouldn't be a place to bring a first date to that's for sure cause if you both don't have laryngitis by the end of the night it'd be a miracle... On to the food...  Appetizers: baked oysters and foie gras French toast ... The baked oysters were their take on oyster Rockefeller and I'll be honest of everything I had there that first bite was the absolute most memorable thing about the visit... It was phenomenal and the presentation was awesome too the French toast was good I liked the pear that came with it however the bread had a flavoring to it I couldn't pin point. it wasn't bad but definitely different ...   Main: We all ordered the filet I had mine med rare and it was cooked perfectly the sauces They have for the steaks all tasted good we tried the wine sauce the bernaise and the chimichurry for sides we ordered the truffle fries the broccolini and the mushroom potpie mushroom potpie tasted excellent but it also tasted good reheated as I just finished it as I write this review :) yum yum !   The broccolini came with a hot chili oil on it that you can't see but boy it was fire in your ass hot I'm going to be in pain in a few hours I reckon but it'll be worth it in the end.  The fries were of course amazing   I also ordered two shrimp to go along with my steak. These things were giant shrimp ... I know now what a 6.00 shrimp looks like and I could have just ordered 5 of those and had that as a meal In itself.... They ate like lobster tails and didn't taste too far off from it either we had no room for dessert but the bread pudding with captain crunch sounded awesome!   As you can see the food here really is spot on you'll definitely pay the tourist tax though but a place like this is something that once in a blue moon the heart calls for ... That is of course it doesn't go into some weird arrhythmic shock and kill you from the thumping of the music in the background.",

    "text": "This was a very nice steak house with a live DJ playing music. The place had a classic dark feel, but the   energy was much livelier and younger. It was a perfect fit for the Cosmopolitan hotel (modern, romantic, and young). I would go back to this steak house.   The order was: * Complimentary dinner rolls (5 of 5). I loved their free dinner rolls. Five dough balls were baked together in a small dutch-oven looking little pot. It was fresh and tasted like Hawaiian bread. It was paired with a green butter sauce. I think the sauce was made from green onion or chives. It had a strong green taste, but it was delicious with the fresh dinner rolls. It was a great start to the steak dinner. * Tuna tartare (3 of 5) $19 on corn tuille - pecans - avocado. Very fresh tuna tartare on top of a chip. The chip was big enough to hold the tuna tartare, but we had to break it apart to eat it. I am not a fan using a chip to hold tuna tartare. I think it is messy and makes the dish hard to share. * Foie gras french toast (3.5 of 5) $24 green apple - almond brioche - sherry gastrique. Tasty, but a little heavy on the syrup. I would also have enjoyed it more, if they considered slicing the apples thinner.  The apples were presented as two chunks and I thought it would have been prettier and easier to eat with the foie gras if it was sliced thinner. I typically think that foie gras appetizers are like pieces of artwork. If you mix and match what is given to you, it enhances the foie gras taste.  * Hamachi (3 of 5) $16 jalapenos - pear vinaigrette. Fresh, and taste was not memorable. I expected more from the four slices of hamachi. * filet 10 oz. (4 of 5) $48 - Tasty and juicy. Nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. No complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content. * bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - Tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. This was tasty and juicy.    * add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - What a bang for the buck! This is probably the cheapest add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. Delicious!!! * add on side raw horseradish $2 - We were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. Nonetheless, we had to order it.   Overall, the place was nice, food was good, and staff was very helpful.",

But if you do still want to have a good quality steak far better than going to like Outback Steakhouse or something like that, and be able to be loud, drink, take shots and prepare for a night that you can't ever talk about again, then STK is the place for you.   The Cosmo is just poppin' all the time, its not a huge casino so most of its bars and clubs are all not to far away from each other. Which probably keeps the energy and atmosphere high no matter where you are.   The steaks here are as good as any upscale steakhouse, maybe not top end liks Mastro's, but right in line with Fleming's, and Boa (I'm not a fan of Boa though). Nothing that will blow your socks off in terms of quality, but nothing to really complain about considering the prices you're about to pay.   No issues about coming back, but wouldn't seek this place out if it wasn't nearby.",

Yes, your dinner conversation is at an insane decibel, but if a cool, sexy, party atmosphere is what you are looking for, then you've hit the right place.  First and foremost, check out the menu so you know what prices you are getting into...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com%2Ftaste%2Frestaurant-collection%2Fstk.aspx&s=be9c899b99071eee48fc54e59c59feb6a77af3aed86e8ec7bf82ab8a8d8a242b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cosmopolitanlasvegas.com...</a>  Typical steakhouse prices, with the added Vegas tourist tax, a la carte sides and additional charges for toppings and sauces and you're looking at $75 per person without wine.  Luckily, all the food we ordered was pretty darn tasty.  Honorable mentions go out to the parmesan truffle fries and the sweet corn pudding (which was more like a creamed corn).  The complimentary bread was delicious!!! Gotta have my carbs!!! Servings are deceptively satisfying despite looking way too small.    I'll agree with most that the seating is borderline uncomfortably tight.  We had 12 girls in our party and they sat us in a booth.  If we had any guys in our group, it would've been way too tight.  If you have a large party, try and book the private room.  Service was good.   We were on a tight time schedule, and our server managed to get us in and out with just enough time.  The busser, on the other hand, managed to pour water all over my friend within minutes of sitting down.  He then proceeded to walk away, tell his friends, and seemingly laugh at us.  Our server tried to make up for his mistake by giving us all free shots, which was appreciated, until we got the bill and were charged for them.  No biggie.  Told our server and they were quickly comped.    Overall, a good time.  The ambiance isn't for everyone or every occasion, but for  a party weekend, it fit the bill.",

    "text": "This is my top restaurant experience in Vegas.  I get to Vegas twice a month and stop in here for dinner almost every time.  I range from eating in the bar to private dining room with big groups to traditional seating.  The people that work there are outstanding.  While the girls at the front desk can be a bit flighty (don't judge the first impression), the management, bartenders,  and the servers are exceptional.    Start with an icy cold ketel martini or a moscow mule served in a copper mug at one of the two bars.  The scenery and people watching is generally off the hook.  The DJ, situated in the middle of the restaurant, plays a solid variety and keeps the energy level up.  The warm bread and green dipping sauce is sinful.  The Shellfish Platter comes in many sizes and has never let me down.  The entire menu can be relatively healthy and is not weighted down with butter and sauces but has great taste and flavor.  The tuna tartare, hamachi,  and shrimp rice krispies are my other go to starters.  For entrees, my fave by far is the filet prepared Pittsburgh Style.  Genius simple preparation and flavor every time.  Back this with broccolini, brussel sprouts and creamed spinach (again, solid ingredients but not buried in other sauces and concoctions).  Last few times, they have been bringing trays of their 8 steak sauces for sampling which have quite a variety.  If you like a cocktail, be sure to sample the Jalapeno shot.  Not on the menu but a mind boggling smoky infused gin beverage.  Terrific and reasonable wine list as well.  From a cost perspective, my bill is generally 50-75% of many of the other restaurants I frequent in Vegas and the experience is better.",

    "text": "I brought my girlfriend here for a late bday dinner during our Vegas trip. Made a reservation weeks in advance so we had no problem being seated pretty quickly when we stepped in. The food was amazing. I ordered a medium sized sirloin steak with a truffle butter add on and my girlfriend ordered the medium sized filet mignon with 3 shrimp and we had a side of sauteed spinach. Meat was cooked to a perfect medium - pink and juicy inside. The busser at our table was on top of getting us more water, etc while our server, no where to be found. He did not tell us the specials for the night (we heard about them when the couple next to us had their server going over the specials), checked on us once during the whole meal, and was quick to bring the dessert menu and to bring the check but was even quicker to take my plastic and swipe it. The servers name was Saul for anyone who wants to avoid having him as your server.  If you have a big group, he'll definitely check on you more as he did with the group of 12+ behind us (bigger tip). Would rate it 5 stars but the server ticked my girlfriend off which is a bad thing especially when it was a birthday dinner for her. Oh and he never brought out a desert for her birthday. Fail.",

The meals were prepared fast, and cooked to perfection.  We had fresh hot bread with a blue cheese butter glaze on top for rolls which everyone said was really tasty (of course I didn't have any due to my lack of preference for cheese), appetizers, salads, meat, meat and more meat...it was definitely a tasty meal, especially the tasty steak/chicken/and seared ahi tuna  Once I'm at a baller status level, I would like to come back and try other non pre-fix things on their menu.",

But seriously, if you're coming to STK, you should know that you'll be dropping $60+ a person.  Steaks range from the smallest 8oz, maybe around $45 to upwards of $90 for a steak. But hey, it'll probably be the best steak, er, STK that you've ever had.  There's lots of buzz around STK in Vegas. It's Cosmo's gem! Perfect for a nice romantic date, also nice if your group of friends want to eat out and splurge a little. It's Vegas after all!  The sides are to die for, and can be quite pricey themselves. Well worth it, of course.  My recommendations are: Tuna tartare Mac n Cheese Can't hurt with the greens too  All in all, you'll probably spend 5x more than a regular meal, but it's Vegas. Come here for fine dining at a top tier price. Simple as that - ENJOY!!   Oh, and every time I've come, I've never had a reservation (party of 2-4) and was seated immediately.",

Don't get me wrong, the steaks are great, but you def pay for what you get.  Plus there's a DJ with an attractive atmosphere (people, aka female people), so you'll get the full Vegas experience.  I would skip the seafood tower, and just focus on the meat and load up (share) some sides.  The seafood tower is grand and looks cool among other tables, but the value just isn't there.  Especially if each oyster or claw works out to be like $20 a piece.  The sauce that it comes with are really awesome though.  So maybe you can just get some bowls of that!",

The thing I noticed and the only reason it's three stars and not four is they really want to move you in and out. There is little down time to enjoy a drink or an appetizer they are checking on you every 5 minutes for this or for that and you can't blink before someone is topping off water or taking a plate. They are just in your face all night rushing you out.   Everyone is nice and professional  and the place is cool they juuuusst kinda make you feel like they want you to leave about 5 minutes after you sit down.   Tip: this is not a kid Friendly joint. It's an upscale little black dress type of place and they have a DJ so it gets loud. Bring the wife not the kids. And tell them to slow down and you enjoy this place.",

    "text": "I was in Vegas last weekend celebrating my 29th year of awesomeness with a friend of mine who had never experienced Vegas before. Said friend wanted to treat me to a fancy steak dinner, per my request, and I chose STK at The Cosmopolitan. Being a huge fan of the Hollywood location, I was more than excited to check out the Vegas venue. We made reservations on a Friday night for the following Saturday night. Make reservations, this place gets crowded fast.  We arrived Saturday night a few minutes early to our reservation and had glasses of wine while we waited for our table. The restaurant was filled with young folks dressed to impress with a DJ spinning hits all wrapped up in a dimly lit purple hued dining room. Just my kinda scene. Very similar to the Hollywood location. The hostess whisked us to our seat promptly and we sat down to order before we could even finish our first glass of wine.  Browsing through the menu, we decided to share a large portion instead of getting two smaller ones. We went big and got the largest steak option, The Cowboy Rib Steak, at a whopping 34oz for $100. Hey, it's Vegas so expect to shell out coins for stuff. On top of that, we got sides of mashed potatoes and asparagus. While we waited for our food, we were served table bread and nibbled on that while we conversed and watched the booming dining room come alive with people holding their drinks and dancing around. Great time.  Food came out in about 20 minutes and looked amazing. Perfectly medium rare cuts of meat and a heaping portion. The sides were great also. I went in for another glass of wine mid meal because I like to get TURNT with dinner. Our server was constantly checking on us, even with having a pretty busy section (right across from us was a party of 15 or so people). Our meal altogether was roughly $200 and I think it was worth every penny. Though next time, I'd probably skip the asparagus and go for the mac and cheese. That sh*t looked amazing!  If you wanna drop some cash on some great food, nightlife vibes and excellent service while you're in Vegas, do STK. Just make a reservation. Unless you like waiting. I hate waiting.  OK. I *highly dislike* waiting.",

We almost felt rushed to eat our food before he comes back and takes our plate. Overall, I will only come back here if I have guests in town who want to come here.

I tend to be hesitant of eating at steakhouses because of a \"I can make my own steak at home for 1/3 the price!\" attitude (thanks, mom!) but STK really brought something extra to the table (literally) with their high quality, extremely flavorful and perfectly cooked dishes (we shared a variety of steaks and chicken). Their side dishes also aren't an afterthought-- their mac and cheese and creamed corn were so mouthwatering, I couldnt stop eating them despite \"not wanting to fill up on carbs\" (moms wisdom again!). They also have great cocktails, particularly a strawberry vodka drink with a graham cracker rim that truly tasted like a berry pie. Yum! The only downside was they were running soooo late- like at least 30 minutes behind our scheduled reservation time, so I would plan to spend some time in the bar sipping (delicious) cocktails :)",

The hostess could not have cared less - her face honestly said 'I don't believe you ever had a reservation'. She was unwilling to listen to how it happened or anything else - a pursed lipped 'sorry we can't help you tonight sir' and practically looking over my shoulder for the next person. Turns out the general manager had lost our booking and after leaving a message for the concierge who personally booked for us - we were called back 15 mins later with a table. Too late - we had been fortunately seated elsewhere.   Amazing how the hostess could say - there is absolutely no way we can take a walk-in group this time on a Saturday on a holiday weekend - then 15 mins later being told we had a table.  We were so disappointed - this is my 1st 1* review on Yelp, but I believe it is deserved. They almost ruined what should've been the highlight of our weekend. The service was so rude - but the real issue is that she made us feel like we were liars or cheaters in front of a big waiting group. We will be advising everyone to avoid.",

It seemed like our server was more concerned about having a good time rather than providing quality service. Who knows, maybe it was just our server.  Ambiance- It was a very nice and upbeat restaurant.   Food- Pretty sure our server forgot about our food because it came out cold. My (medium) steak came out VERY well done. He seemed pretty sorry about it but then we didn't see him for quite a while. Once the steak came out it was still over (between Med well to well done) but I decided to just eat it since my wife was already done eating. Poor quality cut (Ribeye).

I always get a steak there but this year I became a pescatarian therefore forcing me to look beyond my norm. For starters we had the Tuna Tartare which was the best I've tasted. If you love your tuna with heavy citrus, you'll enjoy this for your starter! Not sure if it was the avocado that brought the citrus but I'm here for whatever it was. We also had Foie Gras French Toast which tasted great while warm!   My main dish wash the Alaskan crab,steamed, with side a butter of course. Pretty sure it was just two legs though lol So I def wouldn't suggest that if you're too hungry such as I was. I filled up on their delicious cocktails though!  The Strawberry Cobbler was amazing. I had 3... lol They rim the glass with graham cracker this mixes so well with the drink itself. The Belvedere mixed with sour, muddled strawberries and syrup made for a great after dinner drink, almost like a dessert! Yummmm  Our server Kat was pretty great to us. As busy as she was, she made sure everyone was good and not needing for anything. She also didn't make us feel rushed to order or to leave when it was time.   If you've never been to STK, I highly suggest it. Make it a date night with the girls or spouse even if it's just for a drink. It is a little pricy but the experience is well worth it. The busier the better in my opinion. Good vibes,great food & awesome music.",

I will say, it is over priced for the food that you get, and is not 5 star in my opinion. Tasty dishes but you can find them at any other steakhouse or upscale eatery for far less. But again, out on the town and trying to have a nice night out, go for it.",

So they definitely get 5 stars from me and I will return again, and again, and again lol.",

    "text": "*sigh* it's breaking my heart to write :( . My 3 stars are for the food & ambiance, I knocked 2 off for the food which was EXTREMELY mediocre. If you're looking for a restaurant to pregame before the club & hear some music that'll get you in the mood to party this is defenitly the place! I got out of my chair about 5 times to dance lol. I was celebrating my birthday with my girls and wanted a fun & hip restaurant with a party vibe to eat before hitting the club & this was defenitly it...i loved it!! The music is loud but I was prepared due to all the reviews I read. It didn't bother me nor my friends at all since that's the kind of atmosphere we wanted. The service was amazing as well! We were a hour late to our reservation but we called before hand and the hostesses still made sure to accommodate us which was amazing because a hour is a longgg time to be late lol  Now to the negative...do not eat here. I was with 3 other girls and not one liked their food, it was mediocre at best. If this was my first steak house I probably would have been impressed but since it wasn't I already had an idea in mind of what my steak would taste like and this was not it. All is girls needed steak sauce....ive never requested steak sauce!! Our sides were mashed potatoes one person had mushrooms on top , and I had bacon ... both were very basic and bland ... No flavor what so ever. My 2 girlfriends had sides of mac n cheese which was also basic and the other had bok choy , she enjoyed her side but all 4 of us hated our steak ... well hate is a strong word but we were very unimpressed. We defenitly all felt like it was a waste of 400.00 Would I come back? Yes just for the atmosphere alone but I'd be sure to eat first , this would be a place I'd go for drinks.",

The menu is focused on the steaks as it should be but they have plenty of options available for non steak lovers.  Check out the sweet cream corn it was excellent I would go back just for that.  The staff was all excellent, went for a late dinner and everyone was still top notch and very happy to greet and serve us.  The bone-in filet I ordered was cooked perfectly with a nice outer char which is what I look for in a top notch steak.  Be prepared to make reservations early or dine early or late as they seem to be always busy!  Oh and the music was put together by an on-site DJ and was probably a little loud for an older clientele but perfect for anyone not bothered by some great music.",

Went to their last brunch yesterday and while one would call it quiet because there was like no one there (4 tables at best), it was loud with music; which is cool I guess...like a night club steak house.  Some of the breakfast items looked really good but of course very pricy, not to mention bottomless mimosas for $45. I had an omelet with potatos, it wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular. Our food took almost 45mins to come out but we did have a table of nine... Service was just average, nothing special.  Maybe the servers are just over the brunch thing because it only lasted for just over six months and the bartender informed me it wasn't staying busy enough.  Cool concept but whatever, I just wasn't super impressed.  I guess I really need to experience STK dinner in the future.",

The only reason I knocked this down to a four star rating was because of how loud the music was - no conversation was able to be carried out. We went as a party of five on a Friday night. If loud music and a club atmosphere doesn't bother you during your dining experience then this place is a must go. Personally, I believe if they turned the volume down 20% but maintained the same music selection it would be a better balance - providing the opportunity to have memorable dinner conversation, and still a fun \"pre-club\" energetic atmosphere.   The filet mignon was to die for and one of the best I've ever had. I got the red wine sauce on the side and wasn't much of a fan of it (a little too thick and sweet). Besides - the steak was so good it seriously didn't need any enhancements. I also highly recommend (if you have someone to share with) getting the creamed corn, the mac & cheese and the parmesan truffle fries.",

The service was absolutely horrible by the server James. He was rude and didn't want to answer basic questions. He was in a rush and never even smiled once. James didn't deserve much of a tip for how bad the service was but I still added a 12% tip which is not my norm in any way. But with the service he gave, that was even to much. Looked at my statement this morning and he changed the tip to 20%. And he did that for each person at the table. Absolutely horrible service by him. Food was great but service was horrible.",

    "text": "If you like a side of nightclub with your steak, this is the place for you! Loud, trendy, and hip would be the best adjectives to use when describing the ambiance at STK. A DJ spins music from the 80s, to hip hop, to EDM, so if you're looking for someplace quiet and romantic, this isn't it! However, it's a fun place if you're starting off your night and want to get the party started at dinner. Just be prepared to speak loudly to your fellow diners!  Aside from the atmosphere, STK is a pretty traditional steakhouse in service, food, and presentation. Our server was pleasant and professional, showing a remarkable grasp of the menu and specials. However, there were a few small glitches in service. The first,  when we received an appetizer we didn't order.  The food itself was very good, but not perfect. The complimentary bread had good flavor (it was brushed with blue cheese), but not soft enough for my taste. Our appetizers, the burrata and the scallops dish, were delicious though. The tomatoes were fresh and sweet, the cheese a great compliment. The scallops were meaty and tasty.   However, I was a bit disappointed with the steaks. I ordered the ribeye, medium rare, and it was definitely medium, if not medium well, throughout most of it, being just a light pink instead of the dark pink to red of medium rare. My dining companion ordered the filet, medium, and his was obviously medium rare to rare, so I think the orders must have gotten mixed up. (Second service glitch)  The lobster Mac and cheese was yummy, with big chunks of lobster throughout, and the bananas foster cheesecake was a sweet and tasty end to the meal.  Of course, this decadence is not for the light of wallet. I got a glimpse of the bill -around $350 for 2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine, 2 apps, the 2 steaks, 1 side dish, and 2 desserts.  All in all, a fun steakhouse, and a good meal, but I think I prefer the traditional approach, especially since perhaps all of the noise affected the service slightly. But if partying with a mouth full of meat is your style- party on!",

For me that's saying a LOT! The waiter was always there when you needed something and recommended a fabulous Zinfandel by the glass. The creamed spinach was fresh and so yummy you forgot you were eating spinach. For apps we did the tuna tar tar which was on the small side but the pecans were a nice add as well as the wedge salad that was so fresh and perfect! The decor was modern, the lighting classy but still had a great rock/pop play list that kept the room filled with energy. Can't wait to go to the STK in Los Angeles. So good!!",

The meat is good but perhaps not top-notch. I had some gristle in my sirloin that my knife was not capable of cutting through! That is not what I expect from a piece of meat that cost me $50...  Everything else was great though - the service was impeccable, our waiter was just the right amount of chatty and made sure everything arrived in time and that our water-glasses was never below half empty.  We had a really good time here and I'll definitely stop by again.  Downside is if you arrive late - a DJ will be pumping dance music at a volume high enough to compete with any club... So, if you actually want to talk to your date/comany - come early. If you just want to \"see and be seen\" go whenever.",

    "text": "I expected so much more from this restaurant.  We had an early reservation before a show, seated promptly ( place was empty at 6 on a Friday). Started with the citron cucumber stiletto cocktail, very good. Moved on to several dishes beginning ( party of 4) with: Truffle Fries - oily, poorly seasoned Beef Carpacio - sooo good, great flavor Tartare - fresh, great presentation Beet Salad - big hit, beets w: gorgonzola, super fresh and tasty. Lobster Cocktail - tinie, tiny.. claw portion with small bits of lobster in tomato broth = absolute waste of money. For our Entrees we had 2 steaks, risotto, seared ahi, side spinach and Mac n cheese. All of the entrees were good, not mind blowing or memorable - just good. The Mac n Cheese should be removed from the menu - horrible. The spinach was boring, flavorless.  The only spark during this experience was our server - she was awesome.  I definitely won't return, having sampled several items and only appreciating 2 ( beet , carpacio) of them... It's not enough to bring me back.",

The only thing, which causes me to only give 3 stars, is that our waiter (James) was lackluster: no personality, asked us questions and didn't wait for a response before walking away from the table, reluctantly let us order another round of drinks when our meal ended, and just overall (we felt) rude. We will go back, but hopefully we will have a more personable experience!",

You're looking for the atmosphere over dinner that will lead into the night.  Whether you are dining with your boy/girlfriend, or hosting a group of friends for a bachelor(ette) party, you must go to STK!  The music is loud, and the drinks are strong.  We met an individual, Charity Faith, who made the night even more enjoyable.  She's one of the managers at Bagatelle, but has her feet wet with great services at STK.  [In Vegas, it's not who you are...it's who you know].  When ordering your streak, make sure the waiter hears your order....the music was loud, and everyone was singing, that when I asked for a \"medium well,\" it came out \"well.\"  No worries though - their service was impeccable!",

I know this is a steak house, but I am not a steak fan so I opted for the Dover Sole...I thought it was a little overcooked.  However, that was the only thing I didn't care for!!!  We ordered tons of appetizers and sides...hamburger sliders, shrimp rice krispy thingys, crab salad, some sort of roll thing, sweet corn, macaroni, mushrooms, and a couple that I am forgetting!!!  The macaroni is my FAVORITE!!!  I think I ate a whole one myself!!!  They brought out a congratulatory lava cake that we all shared...very good, as well!!!  Overall, this place is a bit pricey, but has very solidly decent food...oh...and very good drinks!!!    I almost forgot...this place is like eating in a club...they have a DJ!!!  The music was awesome and everyone in the restaurant  was singing....very fun time!!!",

    "text": "At first I thought it would seem strange that the first thing I'm going to mention about this restaurant is the music, but after reading some other reviews I guess I'm not surprised it made such an impression on me. The DJ was AWESOME and the music, although loud enough to grab my attention, was not too loud to make conversation (even across an 8-person table) difficult. I thought it added greatly to the ambience, and when you have people at 5 nearby tables break into song and talking across the booths to one another, I think that spells success.   My steak (the small filet medallion) was cooked perfectly and the sauce was great. I also tried the lamb and the skirtsteak with chimichurri and would recommend both. The sides were ok. I was a little disappointed with the asparagus and the mac-n-cheese. The corn pudding was delightful, however, as was our dessert - the bread pudding. YUM. Captain Crunch and Caramel sauce. Who knew?   The service was great, everyone was very friendly, accomodating, and happy - one server even broke into an impromptu dance when Michael Jackson's \"Billy Jean\" came on.   My one complaint would be the bathroom - there is only one stall and a long line.   Side Note: If you've got time to kill before or after dinner, The Chandelier Bar or Bond Bar in the Cosmopolitan both offer great drinks, beautiful decor, and fun people watching.",

    "text": "Pseudo-Steakhouse and Lounge; All-in-One.  I'm torn writing this because I have mixed reviews on different components of the restaurant.  Ambiance:  4 Stars This place is full of energy, yet remains classy and trendy.  It's filled with attractive people which helps cover for the poor food.  The DJ plays great music, but be prepared to yell to talk with you dinner guests.  Service:  3 Stars Service wasn't memorable.  Average for a fine dining restaurant.  Food:  2 Stars Portions are small and the food is decent.  I had higher expectations given the STK brand.  I've had better food at steakhouses at a 1/4 of the prices at STK.  Value:  3 Stars Expect to pay over $50 a person on average.  This ranking is based on the average of the three scores above.  This is a great place to start your evening as a pre-party for a long Saturday night. Alternatively, great place to end your evening with some energy on a weekday.  Avoid STK if you are looking for a quiet intimate evening or to walk away with a full belly.  I highly recommend STK for the atmosphere, not the food.",

We have only sat in the bar, because we are so last minute, which is actually perfect, because we prefer to socialize. Anyhow, every cocktail, appetizer, entree and dessert that was recommended was beyond delicious. The monkey bread that they bring to the table is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know what they put in it, but its addictive for sure.  We always get a steak, me the filet and my husband the porterhouse and they are always cooked to perfection. We've tried almost every side on the menu at one point or another and haven't had one we don't like yet.",

The 8 oz crab oscar filet is absolutely 1 of the best steaks I have ever had. The tuna tartar is incredible, as is the Mac and cheese and the corn pudding. The environment in STK is always so energetic. The wait staff was very friendly and the service was impeccable. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. True professionalism is all that you will receive at STK. The drinks aren't too bad either. Make sure you try the tuna tartar app and make sure you don't pass on the bread with blue cheese crumbles. Melts in your mouth. Enjoy.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in Vegas with some family and we made reservations for the second night at STK. With all the options in Vegas, I wish we had done something else.  I'm not going to say I have the clearest recollection of the dinner - I mean it was 8 PM in Vegas and I'd had more than a couple beers throughout the afternoon. Ok, I started at breakfast. Still, I remember enough to know that we were seated 30 minutes after our reservation was scheduled and it took over an hour to get our food - long after tables seated after us were scarfing down their entrees. I did complain about the wait and we got a free round of drinks... which is something.  The food (when it eventually arrived) was pretty good. We each had the filet and it was cooked properly and was very tasty. The potatos were disappointing and reminded me of the instant spuds you pour out of a box.  The tap beer list is non-existent, but they had a couple decent options in the bottle including Dogfish Head 60 minute (which they ran out of after my first one) and a couple others. Just plan on drinking cocktails and paying a lot for them... like anywhere else in this town.  If you want a hip, jumping spot for dinner that epitomizes what Vegas is all about these days, look no further. The music is loud, the bar is trendy and it's full of pretty people dressed for the clubs. Just don't expect quick service and give yourself a couple hours to spend here. I don't plan on going there again - too many other great options around there.",

    "text": "Our party of 9 ate here last Saturday in celebration of my 30th birthday. We had a 7 p.m. reservation and were seated within minutes of our arrival. We had a central booth that comfortably fit our large party. As others have mentioned, the music is very loud but I didn't feel it overpowered our conversation and we all enjoyed the ambiance - it is Vegas after all! Our waiter was attentive and mentioned at the beginning of our service that the bar was backed up and it might be awhile until we get our drinks. No big deal. We placed our orders - salads as starters and various cuts of steaks for each member of the party. One of our favorite parts of the meal was the table bread and whatever the ridiculously magical green dipping sauce was that came with it - yum! My husband and I shared a blue cheese wedge salad - good, but nothing to write home about. For my entree, I ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter on top. The steak was good, but I have eaten at enough wonderful steak restaurants to know that I have definitely had better. I'm also not sure the truffle butter was worth an additional $12. We also ordered a few sides for the table - our party seemed to enjoy the truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes.  The meal itself was fine, albeit not impressive, but at least we were enjoying ourselves. This is when things took a turn for the worse. We had paid the well over $1,000 bill and ordered one additional round of drinks to savor the last few minutes of my birthday celebration. At this point, we had been at the table for a reasonable amount of time to feed 9 people, and like I had mentioned earlier, the only holdup was waiting for our drinks to come from the bar. As we were still enjoying the last sips of our drinks, the waiter came over the our table, leaned down to me (who he knew was the birthday girl) and my sister-in-law, and bluntly said \"I'm gonna need your table\". We seriously could not believe our ears. I've never in my life experienced such unprofessional behavior, especially after just spending a significant amount of money on an already sub par meal. If we had been lingering at the table too long, I could maybe understand - I get that you are a busy restaurant and it was a Saturday night. But we had literally just paid the bill and had every right to still be at the table at the time he said this. Maybe a better way to approach the situation would have been to ask politely if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. I am incredibly disappointed that we came here for my birthday dinner, and it will be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. It is their responsibility to schedule their reservations with a reasonable amount of time for people to enjoy their meals and the company they are with. I made this reservation well over a month in advance, and this was totally unacceptable. Because of this, I am NEVER eating here again and will make sure others know that this is how they treat their guests.",

I got the small filet ' Oscar' which means it has crab on it and some sauce. I usually get this at Capital Grille and its excellent there, but its better here. Really.  We got the haricots vert and mushroom pot pie as sides, very good.   Service was good. Waiter seemed to work hard on the 'up sell' - but hey, you can always say no. Vegas prices so a little $$, but not ridiculous.   The only thing I didn't like was we were a party of 2, on this banquette area for other parties of 2, and frankly it was just too tight. I don't want to hear other peoples conversations. I like personal space and I keep a 'bubble' and to be in a restaurant for 90 minutes or whatever is too long to be THAT close.

I'm giving this restaurant a 1 star because I got food poisoning, which was a real shame because the sides were excellent.   My two friends and I started with freshly baked bread in a mini cast iron pot, covered in bleu cheese butter with a chive-olive oil sauce. Amazing!   We skipped the appetizer because we didn't want to fill up before our steaks came.   I ordered a 10 oz filet, medium-rare with foie gras on top. The filet was pretty tough and it was hard to cut into. It which I found odd for a filet, but it was cooked correctly (med-rare). The foie gras was OK - only 'OK' because I was expecting a nice buttery, melt in your mouth kind of texture; and frankly, this wasn't it.   As for sides: \\ - the creamy mash potatoes were standard. - the Brussels sprouts were fabulous. It had small chunks of bacon which gave it a step in front of the game.   Too bad it didn't all get digested. The next morning, I woke up puking everything back up, as well as it was coming out the behind from diarrhea. The only thing I can think of was food poisoning from either the steak or foie gras because I shared everything else with my two friends and they were just fine. It was a miserable 36 hours, which included going  to the bathroom every 30 min. in the first 24 hours. AND I had to fly back home to San Jose, Ca in between bathroom breaks.   I'm sorry if I was too harsh on this. But the fact that I got soo sick  tells me the standards for this restaurant (located in the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas) was not prestige nor up to par. It was the worst ... and i mean THE WORST... food poisoning experience I've ever had.",

My dining partner, who's much more of a foodie than I (don't get me wrong, i love great food), remarked that her filet mignon was probably the best she had in a while. I would go again and again if I could, but I don't make it to Vegas often. Not to mention, I wouldn't be guaranteed to have Sarah as my server, which is a must. Too bad they can't all be like her.

Great music, lots of energy. We were sat at 11:15. I told the waitress a head of time that it was my husband's birthday. We ordered- filet mignon, medium and spicy potatoes with jalepenos. The waitress recommended that when I told her I liked spicy. The food came out. Our steaks- well done. Hard to cut. Uh, no. She saw them and immediately sent them back. So there we were, eating a side of tators. Steaks come back out 15 minutes later from chef himself. Much better this time but it was too bad it didn't come out right at first. We had finished our side by then. Then to make things worse check is dropped off with no mention of birthday. We just paid and left. 3 stars for ambiance. Hope we have better luck next time.

The place is located in one for Vegas newest  and hottest hotels, that would be Cosmopolitan, just by saying that you would know that the place is crowded and full of  people who want to have fun.  Its super loud inside, so if you are looking for a place where you can have a conversation, STK is not the place.  However, there is lots of good music.  I think they have a DJ playing top 40, so you can get your pre-club game on.    The service is pretty good, the waitress answered all of my questions.    Needless to say, the food is pretty amazing.  Meat is cooked exactly how you ask for it to be cooked.  The side dishes are also pretty good.  The girs got a happy b-day slice of cake after we finished dinner. Price wise, well its vegas so it is a little expensive but it is worth it.  All in all, good place to have a nice dinner.

I didn't give five stars because we had reservations and even with reservations we waited well over an hour to be seated.",

    "text": "My first visit to STK was not very positive. A friend and I walked in to get a few cocktails, an appetizer, and some desserts. We stood at the front while the hostesses chatted amongst themselves and completely ignored us. When a different friend suggested that we go back for starters before our reservation at Jaleo, I was hesitant.   I am not a huge fan of supper clubs either and that played into my distaste for this place. When I am at dinner, I generally don't like having to scream across the table to talk to my friends. With that statement being said, I had a great time here. The DJ that night was spinning 90's R&B and I was hooked.   When we got there, we were seated right away this time on the high top tables near the bar. The service was a little slow at the beginning, but all our needs were taken care of. The four of us ordered; shortrib agnolotti with kabucha, steak tartar, crispy shrimp with a spicy bisque, beef carpaccio, and the beet salad.  Overall, the food is decent. The best item was the beet salad. It is not a knock to the other items, but the greens were just that good. I love beets and am glad to see them make an appearance on many menus nowadays. The agnolotti were also wonderful. The stuffed pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. The sauce is reduced to caramel consistency and retained all the flavor of the beef. Out of the raw dishes, the carpaccio was better. The pesto tossed noodles on top was a splendid pairing. I've had better tartars on the Strip, so I would skip that next time. The bisque for the shrimp had a nice flavor to it and would be great for a cold day.   Now, would this be my first choice for dinner? No, but I would not oppose returning.",

    "text": "I had never been to an STK before so I was excited that my husband booked us a dinner reservation here.  I thought the ambiance was classy, party, and fun. The DJ played great tunes all night, not just the current trendy hits, but older hits that everyone still loves (Bon Jovi, White Town, etc).  Better, of course, was the food. I got the filet mignon, which I thought was delicious. My husband loved his, too. We are both foodies and enjoy higher end restaurants so we are very familiar with dining at these style of restaurants - the food was excellent. The only small complaint about the food was that my husband ordered the lobster mac & cheese as a side dish, and it came out with literally ONE piece of lobster in it. We sent it back and our waiter returned with a new dish that had several pieces of lobster in the mac & cheese. I'm not sure what was up with the restaurant trying to scrimp on the lobster in our lobster mac & cheese, so that was disappointing, but other than that, we had a great experience and would most definitely return to STK.",

    "text": "Listen, people: maybe it was waiting until 11:15 PM to be seated, maybe it was the ear-splitting music which forced us to use our other senses, maybe it was purely hunger delirium -- but it was the best steak and sides we've ever had.  None of that means anything. It's such a low number of stars to give for such a great meal, expertly served. It means that everything else that STK allowed to happen that night negated any strong points they earned.  While waiting for a table, we were witness to such a mind-blowingly disgusting display that it prompted a very serious discussion of our group giving up our reservation altogether, going to In-N-Out Burger (no pun intended), and calling it a night.  At the table next to us was a man who had obviously called an escort service, had them send a couple of \"workers\" to meet him at STK, and the three of them gave us a floor show of french kissing, gyrating, miming fellatio and cunnilingus, and general dry-humping, that it's a miracle we could keep our steaks down. Management came over (without us even saying anything -- obviously others were bothered, too) and had terse words with the man, which culled the trio's amorous activities -- temporarily, It was only a matter of minutes until they resumed their table-side  menage-a-trois. When they finally left (like the slow fade of a Viagra commercial), our party came to a realization: we were actually *surrounded* by other couples who were very obviously the products of a \"business transaction\" as opposed to.....actual dates. Gorgeous African-American young beauty in skin-tight scuba dress un-zippered to the navel seated with nebbish nerd, to cite an example.  You bet we're in Vegas. Anything goes. And we're fully up for that. But when the conduct of certain patrons supersedes the comfort of others ponying up significant sums for their Wagyu beef, or the management at STK does not see the slippery slope of cheerfully opening their doors as a clubhouse for the sex trade, they might as well change the theme to Thai Ping-Pong Bar and be done with it. (or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to \"STD\"?)  Hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a Hustler Letter to the Editor in the making?  Stop the Ho's at the door. For the love of Christ, turn down the music. Now you've really got something.",

    "text": "I chose STK for a friend's birthday dinner as the menu looked interesting. The food, however, was simply lacking. Nothing impressed me, nothing made me want to come back or recommend it to friends. For a pricey meal it fell short. The food warrants maybe three stars, but for the PRICE the lack of flavor and terrible textures are just inexcusable in my opinion. If you compare the menu items I list with the price on the website, you will quickly understand why this review is warranted.  We ordered:  Appetizers - Foie Gras French Toast (which I imagined would be amazing...unfortunately, terrible texture and TASTE. It was mushy spread on mushy toast.) and Shrimp Rice Krispies. Meh. The Shrimp Rice Krispies didn't have much flavor and the \"krispiness\" became sogginess after half of a bite. The krispies were for presentation effect as they did do a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when the bisque was poured over them. These were the items that drew us in as they were the most unique. The presentation was good, but the outcome was not a success.  Entree - There were three of us. Two of us ordered the Bone-in ribeye and filet, both flavorless somehow but tender. They were the right temperature, which we appreciated. The third person ordered a smaller filet medallion with similar comment.  Sides - Mac&cheese, brussel sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes. They were good but when the SIDES are the best part, you know there is a problem. ALSO, if you are considering adding truffle butter to your steak, spare yourself the $12 and get the mashed potatoes for $11. It was basically a bowl of mashed potatoes with a pool of melted truffle butter sitting on top...which meant the initial texture was too watery to be appetizing. By the end of the meal, they hardened and were better.  Desserts - Bread pudding and Espresso Charlotte, so so. No complaints but no wow factor.  As you can see, we sampled plenty of food to make a valid judgment call. It was sad to spend so much and leave dissatisfied. Wouldn't go back given SO many better options in Vegas. Go to the Wicked Spoon buffet in the same casino. Now THAT was worth it.",

    "text": "So, yes it's hard to find a bad steak in Vegas, but this place is more than a good steak... It's a phenomenal dining experience with the finest quality foods molded into divine creations with superb drinks and wonderful service. Props to Ashley!  I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside.   The beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalapeno onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side.   The ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between.   We dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud. We had a total blast.   Overall, yea I dropped a $G at this place but the supreme dining experience that my guests and I totally loved made it totally worth it.   Yea. Amazeballs!",

    "text": "Wanted a fun restaurant, where our friends and us didn't have to worry about complaints if we were a little loud. Being it was my wife's 40th birthday, this was supposed to be the beginning of a crazy, fun filled night. Our reservations were for 8:45, but they didn't seat us until around 9:45. The music was decent and very loud, which was fine with us. Finally after being seated, the waiter told us the specials, then disappeared.  We sat there drinking water, waiting for 40 minutes, and he never returned.  All of the poor reviews on Yelp complained about the prices, and they are all True. If money is no object for you, you probably won't mind. However, with a party of 7, I didn't expect to see a porterhouse steak for $129, no sides included. Now that people in our party are starting to get angry for being ignored for so long. This was unacceptable, considering our bill was about to be $700+. So we walked out, and ended up at Musashi Teppan. Had an absolute blast, doing sake bombs with our chef. Personally, I feel that because STK just expects that because you are already there, they've already earned your money. Next time, if we want steak, we'll go back to Gordon Ramsay's or SW at the Wynn.",

After checking in, we were promptly seated.  Our server (Colin) was very informative, animated, and answered every one of our questions in detail.  He even described which parts of a cow were cut for the types of steak meats. The bread was AMAZING.  I enjoyed the tuna tartar appetizer, but the best part of the meal was the steak.  I ordered the filet in bone and it was so tender, it cut with a regular knife. (I was wondering why they didn't give us steak knives)  Our water glasses were constantly refilled, and the wine selection was overwhelming. (in a good way)  We also enjoyed the cheesecake lollipop desserts.  The ambience was hip, and the music selection was good. (Like other reviewers said, the volume did go up every hour, haha!)  I would definitely come back here again.  I would also like to try their other locations in NYC and LA as well, if I had the chance to. :)",

The skinny:  FOOD - the bread (what's in it other than buttery heaven?):  I could've had this all night! - the appetizers/sides: the brussel sprouts, mac & cheese, beef tartare and pumkin ravioli were all devine! - sole is one of the few fish options on the menu. It was cooked very well and filling - but it didn't leave a great impression on my like the appetizers/sides did!    SERVICE Our waiter was on point and this definitely takes a different feel from the traditional white napkin steakhouse.    VIBE This place is even better with a group!  This hip, modern, trendy place gets packed quick!  The DJ starts rocking at 8pm (you'll hear some top 40 mixed in with house).  Expect to pay $50+/per person (and this is on the cheap end) but hey you get what you pay for!  What makes this place one of my new favorite restaurants is the experience & the side/appetizer dishes (which i loved more than my entree).  Oh, and you can get up to a 34 oz steak for all you meat lovers.",

Manager was very apologetic and took a round of cocktails off our bill which was a nice gesture. Our server was great, although I forgot her name. Everything was delicious from the cocktails to salads, to main course, sides to desert. My fillet was cooked perfectly to the medium temp I requested. Ambiance and atmosphere is nice, decor is trendy and nice, DJ spinning some cool tunes, as other reviews state it is a little on the loud side but very upbeat and sets the mood for some good pre-gaming if you are headed to the clubs later on in the evening.

Maybe it was the raised dining room and the half moon booths? Whatever it was, I very much enjoyed it! The atmosphere was loud and very sexy, but the setting was perfect because we could still have an intimate conversation at our table.   To start, they brought us the delicious bleu cheese butter bread and this tantalizing sauce to go with it. It was like a chive, garlic, olive oil blend and it was nothing like I've ever tasted before. It had us all craving more!  Next, we ordered the beef carpaccio with these wonderful pesto noodles. Highly recommend this dish and it still stands out to us, even the next day.  For dinner, we went a little craZy. We had to try some of these unique sides! My personal favorites were the mushroom pot pie and the original Mac and cheese. Our server (who was lovely and I can't remember name!) recommended getting truffle mashed potatoes and keeping the Mac and cheese to a regular order. I'm SO happy we did this. We loved that Mac and cheese so much, we ended up ordering another one   We also shared the 38oz cowboy ribeye (sliced in the kitchen-thank you again to our server for that suggestion) The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare with a crispy, charred layer on the outside and a warm cool center. It melted in my mouth.  Hands down, one of the best dinners I've had in Vegas. Make a reservation because you'll certainly need one for this packed house! And rightfully so, I cannot wait to go back for another delicious meal!",

I ordered the special branzino and my bf the skirt steak medium.  The steak was like jerky and the fish was bathed in salt.  The server was awesome and was happy to replace our food.  He got a steak cooked perfectly but now too salty.  I ordered the mac n cheese trio.  Presentation was fabulous coming out but the skillets were filled with cold mac n cheese.   At this point I threw the towel in.  No to go boxes and hardly eaten food, a manager or at least our server should have noticed.  Sorry to say food sucks!  Instead of having pimp like looking dudes scoping the room, you should have a proper chef who can cook and a taster to make sure the food taste good going out but concentration is on \"scene\" here.  STAY AWAY!  Too bad.",

With that being said Jillian exceeded all possible expectations as a server. She was personable, whitty, extremely knowledgeable and very helpful with navigating the menu with spot on suggestions. While the meal was very enjoyable, I had my gripes. I recognize that mostly stems from my exposure to the industry that many others may not have so I will keep those gripes to myself. However this is a 3 star review without Jillian's service.",

Nothing memorable especially for $80 piece of meat laden with gristle and A la carte, I could say I was expecting much better quality cut of beef. Steak had lots of gristle and chunks of fat, not palatable at all. It was also served with two different sauces. That should have been the red flag. No self-respecting steak house who claims to serve top quality cuts needs to serve sauce. The meat should speak for itself.  Bread was really good. Had a hint of butter and blue cheese and was a great way to mop up the juices.  For the sides got a creamed corn and mashed potatoes. Nothing fancy or memorable.  Overall dining experience was ok.  For the price I would much rather spend it at a better steak house.",

When you're done eating you walk out ready to hit the Strip and party like a rockstar. I wish this was a club. Their dj's play the best beats spinning old school and hip hop. No overplayed EDM music. Thank goodness for variety and flavor. GF friendly too- always a plus!",

    "text": "Get ready to get dolled up and have a FABULOUS dinner.  This is by far the best dining experience we've had in Vegas.   My husband and I love all things foodie (although - we prefer not to refer to ourselves as such, as it makes us feel obnoxious!).  So when we go to Vegas, the main thing we seek out for entertainment is dining at high-end restaurants.  Screw gambling, I'd rather eat my money away than gamble it away.   We've had some amazing dinners out in Vegas, but this one was by far the best experience we've had, from food to service - all things were on point.   SERVICE:  Our waitress was such a sweetheart, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She offered some suggestions when we inquired about the menu, and also proposed an order for things to come out.  The timing and order of everything was perfect; we were never bombarded by food, and the wait between courses was never very long.    The others on the wait staff were also very attentive.  Our waters were never empty, our tables were always folded if we left to use the bathroom facilities, and any time our cocktails/wine was looking low, there was someone there to offer us another.    FOOD:   Caesar Salad (4 stars) - Don't know how they did it, but even the Caesar salad was rememberable.  The lettuce was so crisp/fresh, and the dressing and croutons were remarkably tasty.  Spiced Pickled Prawns (5 stars) - Hands down the best starter/non-beef item of the night.  Actually, ranks right up there with the steak with how much I truly enjoyed this item.  The two are just apples and oranges, so hard to really compare the two. Anyway, I will get this EVERY time I'm here.  The shrimp was perfectly crisp (not the dense/gritty texture that you sometimes find with some shrimp when they've been completely overcooked) and SO fresh.  Also, loved the balance of acidity with the level of heat.  I love heat, so I ended up eating all of the slices of jalapeno pepper it came with (my husband avoided those, and enjoyed his level of heat without them)  Lobster Cocktail (3.5 stars) - This was good, but in comparison to everything else, not rememberable.  We would forego this item next time.  Bone-in Filet (5 stars) - Holy crap, the star of the night.  Definitely enough steak to split between the two of us.  So amazing, and perfectly cooked to our requested rare-medium/rare.  Pork Belly (3 stars)  -  This item came along with the steak and fries toward the end of our meal.  It was delicious, but I wish it had more crispiness (I'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's been crisped up just right - the texture of chewy/soft fat makes me want to hurl).  Probably wouldn't order this item again.  Maybe would have \"shined\" a bit more if it wasn't brought out with the steak and fries, who knows.  Parmesan Truffle Fries (4.5 stars) - So full of truffle flavor, piping hot, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.  A must order for sides.  DRINKS:  Double Espresso - We rarely do coffee/dessert after dinner, but this one called for it.  The espresso (while very, very spendy!!) was perfection.  Don't think I'd get it again, however, as the price was gasp-worthy (something like $12-15 each for a small little espresso drink).  Manhattan - Very well balanced and tasty (per my husband); one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  That would have made the cocktail perfection in a glass.  Vodka Martini Up w/ Splash of St. Germain - Perfection in a glass; a signature of mine, I've found a lot of places over-do the St. Germain so it's too sweet and not to my liking.  This place nailed it (twice - oops!).  Glass of \"Justin\" Cabernet Savignon to pair with the steak ($4) - We'd tried a bottle of Justin red blend previously (retails around $40-50 a bottle), so we decided to try out the cab.  We were not disappointed, and it paired very nicely with the filet.  OVERALL:   Fantastic dinner experience.  An experience indeed.  Will definitely be back; and have also through out the idea of stopping into STK NYC when we're out there next month.",

We knew what to expect by reading all the reviews. Yes, it's louder. I was a little concerned about that when we walked in. How are we going to have all of our magical and relevant convos about why our kids whine so much with the loud music? Relax though, it's not bad.  We were able to hear each other fine and also hear our server.   My dad can't stand certain music though and he would have thought he was entering the 7th circle of hell. If you don't like hip hop, (and AC/DC. Like anything that is played at a 25 year old's wedding) avoid this. Don't even try to make it ok.  We were checked in by a very friendly host who directed us to go hang out at the bar and they'd find us to take us to our table. We ordered a drink- great bar staff. I asked for some sort of bourbon-ey cocktail. Boyfriend got something off menu with pear. Both fab.  We were seated at a small table and opted to be that couple who snuggles next to each other on the booth side. You know, those people who I used to make fun of. We're 40 year old Midwesterners with 3 little kids, so naturally we use Vegas as an excuse to wear fashionable/revealing clothing and snuggle, then not be stared at. This restaurant was the perfect place to do that.  I'm rambling so will stay on track now. Sorry.  Food- oh damn. So there's this bread with dip (oil I think? It's green) they bring out. No idea what the dip was because I didn't care. I was too busy crying about how good it was. Steak- amazing. Had the truffle butter and highly recommend. Mashed potatoes and asparagus- awesome. Asparagus was huge. Not wimpy. Huge.  We could prob have shared a side but we aren't huge eaters. Or maybe we are but um I guess we were starving 3 hours prior and had a Secret Pizza snack. Whoops.   Service- We had one of the best servers we've ever, ever had. You know, I'd venture to say best. Brandon was attentive, knowledgeable, and gave great advice on what to order. And he's personable and fun! Love it when you want to go back to a place to see a server and not just for the food. That says a lot.   I recommend STK for a fun night out with great food and service!",

We liked the ambiance and the energy of the restaurant. Before long, we were greeted by our server Edward.          It was immediately obvious that Edward was \"Mr. Cool\". He basically told us what we should order and informed us of the specials. I believe he dropped an F-Bomb with his delivery. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers to start. It became apparent that Edward was looking to flip the table very quickly.  He was relentless with his efforts to rush us out of the place. We attempted to order a bottle or two of the Jordon Cab that happened to be a glass pour. He said that we cannot purchase that by the bottle. I thought this was a little strange having been a wine director myself years ago. I was always happy to pop a cork on any bottle that I had on site. What made it worse is that we had an extremely difficult time ordering a second or third glass of wine!  Edward kept trying to drop the check while people in our group were still eating!  He continued to push the check on us and we hadn't even had the opportunity to peruse the dessert menu.  Our group was very timely and there simply was no reason for this type of behavior. We decided to skip dessert and after dinner drinks after every person in our group was thoroughly frustrated by this clown Edward that was serving us. When we accepted the check we were not informed that the gratuity had been added.  I have no doubt that this was an intentional attempt at getting a double tip. I understand that the restaurant has a party atmosphere, however, it falls short of anything resembling fine dining service.",

    "text": "Probably one of my favorite/most memorable dining experiences I have ever had.  Went with a group of 4 and everything was wonderful.  Our group started off with a dozen oysters and then ordered another 6 - that's how great they were.  We also shared the crab legs which were amazing.  They were large and delicious - but definitely not large enough as a main.  We each ordered a filet, and they were all delicious and cooked to order.  Although I would say that if you like your steak medium rare - you should order medium.  Sides were the tots (melt in your mouth delicious) and Mac and cheese (gooey and a great mix of cheeses).    It was my SIL's birthday, so they brought out a dessert with chocolate mousse - great flavor and not too sweet.  We also ordered the donuts on our servers recommendation.  These were soft, delicious and the maple glaze was perfection.  The service was on point, quickly clearing plates/glasses for the table without making it feel as if they were in a rush for us to get out.",

The restaurant was not busy at all but for some reason I waited over 20 min for a table. Service was good they were very nice but: The dish I wanted was not available so I had to choose something different.  I ordered a steak asked for medium it was actually medium well (72$) . My girl order market fish which was under cock a bit. Very dissapointe in general from the food . Was not worth a 250$ dinner . I had so much expection from that place .... I hope next time I will be back I will have better experience.    Still amazing restaurant , staff was doing a great job. I will recommend to come visit here hoping your experience will be better .",

We left without eating.  I wasn't spending hundreds of dollars for a meal I could not enjoy because of the loud atmosphere and noise of people screaming at each other and the very  Loud music!  We ended up going across the mall to Blue Ribbon and had an amazing meal, good ambiance  and service",

The ambiance is pretty dark but about the same as candlelight but still light enough to see the person on the other side of the table.  Got the small 6 oz steak and the group got the sides asparagus, parmesan truffles, and mac and cheese as sides.  Funny everything is a la carte so if you just order the steak the plate literally just comes out with the steak and the plate looks so empty.  I don't think I've ever seen that.  But the steak was amazing.  Just seared right on the outside and super tender on the inside. I wish I would've gotten the bigger size.  The waiter was really nice and attentive.  The prices were as expected for a nice steak in a nice restaurant.  I would definitely come back especially since I love the rooms at Cosmopolitan.",

As a steak place I was expecting more or the very least a good piece of meat. The cowboy steak was disappointing. It was peppered with cartilage. It paled in comparison to any I've eaten in the past. Anywhere. Yup.  A group of us came for my birthday dinner. It was a fun night and a fun atmosphere.   The service and the rest of our food were awesome! It was just strange to have a mediocre meat from a purportedly steak place. Especially the cowboy at $95 for a 34oz steak.   We shared everything. Their martinis are great. Their lobster mac stood out. Oysters so fresh. Their Burrata! Get this! Their Beef tartare is one of their weakest link too. Lacking in flavor.   Otherwise their service was fast and we never lack for anything. As busy as the place was we were attended to well!   The bday cake was a nice touch! Thank you!",

Ditching the old school charm of wood, glass and soft yellow lighting, STK settles instead for modern decor and practically no light whatsoever besides the candles adorning each table.   Being a carnivore, I don't dwell on much besides the food, but on that note, there is practically nothing of note. You get a high quality, perfectly cooked steak here along with some fairly enjoyable and quality sides all whole being well taken care of by the attentive service staff. That being said competition is stiff in this town and I think you can do better by dining anywhere whose namesake belongs to a certain chef known for his choice words (beef Wellington and killer truffle Mac) or by going with an experience transplanted from a other parts of the country \"del Frisco, Joe's prime steak (nobody does ribeye like and old school steakhouse, get crab claws too), etc...",

Everything was well prepared and came out fresh and hot. The drinks were really good.  My only complaint is the proximity of the tables. I literally had to move other tables to get out of where we sat. Even then my butt was all in someone's face when I got up. No bueno. LOL! Great place. Great food. Great service. Thanks STK Vegas.",

There was great music playing all night although the volume was so loud it was difficult to carry on conversations with anyone more than 2 seats down. Much more of a club vibe compared to traditional steakhouses.",

    "text": "So I was very much on the fence on this place, but since there is not 3.5 or -4.0 I have to give this a 3.  First off this is a VERY noisy place and initially they tried to sit us in the bar area which was crazy noisy and we immediately told them this wouldn't work.  Ultimately they sat us in the main restaurant area, great we came to talk to one another.  NOT.  We sat down and then the very loud hard rock music starts. Now I like AC/DC as much as the next guy and at reference volume when I am enjoying it by myself going down the highway or cranking up my Martin Logan's at home, but in a Steak Place!!! HUGE MISS.  STK Management, we the people that can afford to eat at this VERY VERY expensive place are there for some quiet. I get it, this isn't Smith & Wolnisky, much more hip than that, but turn the @#$#@ music down.  Now the meal was very good, that was a solid 4.  My $72 strip steak was good, very good, not the best I have ever had but super nice.  The wine list was extensive but this is a 3 figure wine list and many over $200.  We settled on a Freemark Abbey that was a bit too young for $135 bucks.  This place is very expensive so either this is a very special occasion, your a billionaire or you have a corporate expense account.  overall I have had better steak places and I have for sure worse ones. But if your trying to find a place to have a quiet dinner like a S&W or the like, this ain't it.  But if your in the cosmo and money isn't an issue, I would hit it.",

    "text": "Came here last night for the very first time thru a friends' high recommendation. Ambience is very nice. The service was absolutely impeccable! Only downside was that the food was very subpar compared to the outrageous prices. Hey, if the food blew me away I have no problem paying $72 for a really good steak and over $150 per person but quite frankly I was NOT IMPRESSED! Furthermore, I got severely sick from their food last night, ruining my birthday and my husbands' birthday and our friends dual bachelor and bachelorette party last night.   My husband and I started with the Alaskan king crab legs as an appetizer. For $32 for an appetizer, you would expect more than two barely 5\" two crab legs. The first leg my husband and I shared was really good! The second leg which I shared w him, I put a giant mouthful into my mouth and as I swallowed it, I was overwhelmed with the most fishy taste I have ever come across. It was so fishy that I practically felt like puking in my mouth. But I tried to make the most out of it. But after what happened, the entire dinner was basically ruined. I was consumed with nausea which I tried my best to fight off and NOT have it ruin our evening.   So we told our server (amazing service FYI) and she replaced the crab leg appetizer for another appetizer. We ordered the short rib ravioli and it was absolutely delicious!!! The soft short ribs inside the ravioli was a heavenly explosion in my mouth. Highly recommend this appetizer!  As my main course, I got the 6oz filet topped w lobster and my husband got the dry aged 14 oz delmonico steak topped w lobster as well, with a side of asparagus. The good thing is you can customize your steak however you want w whatever toppings and side. So the steaks were good. Decent. I ordered mine medium rare which came out medium or well done (which I did not even tell our server) and it was good but pretty dry perhaps due to it being overcooked. I had a bite of my husband's steak dipped in bearnaise sauce. His was actually cooked medium rare like how he wanted. It wasn't dry but didn't taste any of the dry aged flavors like they talk about on their menu. Quite frankly, the food is good but for the price, I was NOT IMPRESSED.   The rest of my night was ruined because I developed a small case of food poisoning from that rotten super fishy piece of crab leg I ate. I tried my best to tough it out but ultimately ended up cutting the night early to go to my room to throw up and sleep it off. I know it was the crab legs since this was my ONLY meal I had the entire day. So basically my birthday dinner last night was ruined and so were all the other festivities that followed after.",

For my husband and I it was relieving since we are not usually high class people. The atmosphere is dark and very loud, but the music is great and the service was wonderful. The food was disappointing per the price tag, my medium cooked sirloin was quite charred on the outside, but it was extremely tender. Our mashed potatoes were down right amazing, but gosh, I understand you get what you pay for but is a 15 dollar charge on top of an 80 dollar steak entirely necessary? You telling me you can't make a good profit otherwise? A few tables are quite close together, I nearly had a gentleman's bum in my face as he slid into his seat.  I won't ever return, but it's not because I hated it.",

If you haven't had their rolls with garlic butter sauce, you're in for a treat! The rack of lamb was the highlight for me as it was cooked perfectly medium to medium rare, crispy with a savory exterior layer that I'm dreaming about while writing my review! You can't go wrong with their steaks either and to top off the evening they brought out a sparking plate with 3 small bite desserts for the table to share! A very memorable experience! Thanks STK!!",

We were well greeted at the front desk and took us to our seat. The server was nah... he was pushy for us to get alcohol drinks and appetizers. We do not drink alcohol and we were pretty hungry so we asked for 2 non-alcoholic drinks and entrees with 2 side dishes and its famous sauces. HE TOTALLY LOOKED DOWN ON US. YOu can totally see in his eyes he was insulting us that we were sooo cheap. Well, I am a very straight forward person. If I am hungry, I will order a lot but if I am not, why should I just order food and look rich? We were offered with Blue cheese bread which was pretty good but my skirt steak was not the greatest. I had better.... My meat had a taste... like strong meat taste which I could not stand. I ate little. My husband got the Bone-in Rib Eye, he said he got better... Well, to summarize, if you want to be looked down because you haven't ordered all plates on the menu + alcohol drink or a bottle of wine, then try it. If you want a pleasent and a prefect steak, please stop by Maestro or Fleming's. We had much better experience over there! BTW, we are Fleming's regular customer  =)  STK - RUDE SERVER + MEDIOCRE FOOD!",

However, we were offered to have the full menu in the lounge area so we did just that. We sat down and the friendly waitress came right over to get our drink order. I had the Electric Pink (I think) and it was delicious!! Next she told us the specials (and she was honest about one of them not being her favorite, which is always appreciated).  She then brought out the complimentary bread which is AMAZING! Hot and fresh with a blue cheese glaze. I could have eaten it all night. Our dinners came out just after we finished the bread. I had the small filet which was amazing. I also ordered the blue cheese sauce, but didn't eat much of it because the taste covered up the yumminess of the steak. That being said, when dinners come without sides the slab of meat is always lacking in presentation. We did order the mashed potatoes and mac & cheese to share (there is plenty to share). The sides were lacking (hence the 4 stars). The mashed potatoes tasted like mashed potatoes. There was no flavor to them whatsoever. The mac and cheese wasn't even as good as the \"blue box\" kind. It didn't have much of a cheese taste and I didn't like the tiny noodles that were hard to get on the fork.  We notified the waitress of a birthday in the party. They brought out a cute little dessert that they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate on. I noticed on the bill that they charged us $2 for it. Not a big deal but if Chilis can afford a free birthday dessert, I would think that a place with a $100/person tab could throw one in as well.  Overall, a great dinner and a fantastic time.",

The food is consistent, try the corm pudding for a side dish-Yummy!  They had 80's hits pumping while we dined and the party I was with loved that!   The service was quick and everyone's food came out to order.  While in their private dining room you could see the Belliago fountains through the picture window.  This place is not stuffy, so going in reasonably casual would be fine.  I will be back!",

Nice wine list.. We shared a bottle of a good russina river Pinot Noir. For an appitizer we shared 6 oysters on the half shell. The oysters were good, but the person shucking them was not... a few too many shell pieces. I had the Rice Crispy Shrimp, Excellent, She had the endive salad, also very good. We shared a 8 oz organic tenderloin, it was prepaired perfect and tasted great. and the whipped potatos, a good side. For dessert we were going to pass, but I had mentioned that it was her birthday to the hostess on the way in, they brought out an excellent crem brulee. The one star deduct is for two reasons. Our waitress Michelle was very good, she just had too many tables. At the peak she was working 5 tables with 14 guests....way to many for a high end resturant. The bathrooms, a single stall each...really, for a place as large as this ??",

I am actually a vegetarian who has a fiance that LOOVVESS steaks so I've been to just about every trendy steakhouse in the country minus actually eating it. LOL. On that note, the ambiance is great. I usually go to the STK in New York and love it there. The one in Vegas is similar, very trendy cool hang out. The drinks are a bit pricey but to be expected. I ordered the chicken, sounds kinda blah but was actually very delicious. I think they drizzle it with some sort of caramelized glaze that made it to die for. If your into young beautiful people with money to blow and a great ambiance then this is the place to be.",

    "text": "My friends and I were in Vegas over the weekend for a friend's birthday.  We had made reservations at STK and let me tell you, I can't recall a more fun, more awesome dinner experience I've ever had.  Everything, from the moment we walked in to the moment we stepped out, was perfect!  It was packed, it was loud, and it was busy.  So if you're looking for a quiet place to have a meal, turn around and go to grammas' house!  We got there a little early and bellied up to the bar for a round of drinks.  Pricey?  Yeah!  Worth it? !@#$ yeah!  Nothing watered down here folks.  Stiff drinks served in large glasses.  Some of the ladies in our group were feeling the effects after their first drink.  We sat at a large, comfy table in the main dining area right near the bar.  We were greeted by the best waitress/server I've seen in a long time; Michelle.  She was great.  Friendly, professional, attentive, knowledgeable, sweet, hot, fun, the whole package.  I took charge of the appetizers and we had a large seafood platter with crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters, sauces, and all kinds of other goodies.  I ordered 4 different salads for the table to share.  I roll with a pretty picky bunch when it comes to food.  I didn't hear a single complaint and all the appetizer plates were cleaned off!  Time for the entrees.  I ordered the \"24 oz. porterhouse, medium rare, sliced off the bone please\"!  OMG! Hot, juicy, perfectly marbled, sliced against the grain, so every beefy, juicy, fatty morsel was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  The sides were also wonderful.  The creamy Yukon potatoes, the parmesan truffle fries, the mushroom pot-pie, and of course, the mac n' cheese.  Each one brought a new element of flavor and texture to the party.  I don't have a negative thing to say about any of the food.  We all ordered different cuts of meat.  Some had the petite fillet, the cowboy rib-eye, the bone-in fillet, one of the ladies even ordered the roasted Dover sole! ( I take no responsibility for that one, but when she wasn't looking, I took a piece and that too was delish!)  Dessert time.  Michelle approached me and asked me if we'd like to see a dessert menu.  I told her it was my friend's birthday.  She simply said. \"Would you like me to take care of it?\"  Awesome!  That is exactly what I wanted to hear.  She took the initiative and made it happen.  A large tray with an assortment of desserts showed up a few minutes later with \"Happy Birthday\" inscribed in chocolate across the platter with candles.  Perfect.  I love it when a server takes control, shows leadership and \"hooks it up\".  All I remember is taking a spoonful of bread pudding, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drenched in a warm caramel sauce topped with what I think was Cap'n Crunch cereal and thinking to myself, \"Now, I can die!\".  In all honesty, I've had a better steak at CUT or Mastro's in Beverly Hills, but this steak is a very close second.  But neither CUT nor Mastro's (in the numerous times that I've been to each) even comes close to the service we got and the fun time we had at STK. NOT! EVEN! CLOSE!  Now, for the party that broke out in the restaurant during dinner.  This is where the fun comes in.  The resident DJ was inspiring!  He played the coolest, hippest, most fun, and most want-to-get-out-of-your-seat-and-sing-and-dance-along music ever!  From Sinatra, Bon Jovi, Journey, Kid Rock, Joan Jett, Jay-Z, Lady Ga-Ga, Madonna.  He turned this already loud and happening restaurant into a full blown night club.  We and the three or four tables around us were up and singing and dancing and jumping, and laughing, and drinking, and hugging like it was a wedding or something.  The nine of us all agreed, this was the most fun, and most memorable dinner experience we've ever had.  The next time you go to Vegas with a large group, go to STK, ask to sit in Michelle's section and be ready to party!  Thank you STK, Michelle and the rest of your team.  You guys gave us a night we'll never forget.",

The bachelorette had made the dinner reservation two months in advance but we still had to wait over an hour to get seated.  I would have understood more if we had been a huge party, but as there were only seven of us, this seemed completely unacceptable and, unfortunately, that wasn't the worst part.  Once we were seated and had ordered, they dropped one of our entrees on the floor and completely forgot to bring another one out.  After complaining to the manager numerous times, we ended up getting some of our bill comped, but it wasn't worth the stress for what should have been a celebratory dinner.  I won't be going back here again.",

    "text": "The STK in Las Vegas is a close second to the STK in Miami. It is not as big as the Miami location, so the lounge/bar area is basically in the same area as the dining/eating area.   Generally, the LV STK is fun on Mondays for Industry Night, but people don't usually eat. It's more of a drinking, social event. To mix it up, we came to the LV STK with a group of eight people at 11:00pm on a Saturday night. We had reservations and the restaurant was packed.   It definitely has a fun, LOUD vibe, so if you're looking for a quiet romantic restaurant, this STK is not for you. Unless you come before the music gets loud.   The hostess was fabulous, service was good, and the food was delicious.  Here is why I knocked it two stars:  1. There were middle-aged women dancing on top of the booths. That's fine in a nightclub, or even STK's lounge area, or even at someone else's booth who is ok with it, but they were dancing on top of our booth which was not ok. I was disgusted at the idea of sitting in the booth, while these women danced right where our heads were resting with their DIRTY, BARE FEET. Totally disgusting. I politely motioned to one of them and said \"Hi, this our table, we are sitting here\" with a smile. She looked at me and said \"So?!\" I was so surprised at this rude, middle-aged woman's response that I didn't know what to say for a moment. Luckily the hostess slid in and shooed them away, commenting how rude they were. Needless to say, it took a few cocktails for me to regain my appetite. If STK wants to promote a nightclub vibe do it where patrons won't be eating, or atleast impose some standards on who you will have up there dancing. Our party spent over $700 (food and alcohol) and for that money I don't want the experience of dirty, middle-aged Housewives-rejects dancing around my head as I eat.  2. I ordered the 7 oz. filet mignon medium-rare. It arrived nearly well-done. No pink whatsoever. However, to STK's credit, the server was immediately apologetic and when my second steak arrived it was perfect.",

While the first couple of bites were juicy and delicious, the steak got dry over time and the salt was a bit overbearing. I'm guessing they served the steak to me without adequate rest and oversalted the meat a bit.  5-stars for the mac n cheese and yukon gold potato puree side dishes. i thoroughly enjoyed these side dishes. of all the steak places i've eaten, it is nearly on par with Craftsteak's side dishes.   overall it was a good dining experience.",

I don't understand why the music has to  be at nightclub volumes. The service was just OK, too. Maybe that was just because I could never hear our waiter? Anyways, there are plenty of delish places at The Cosmo to eat... I'd say skip this one.",

    "text": "In our quest to try out all the restaurants at the Cosmo the boyfriend and I decided to try STK for our date night last night.  I had made a reservation for 8:30 but when we arrived  the hostess told us it would be a few moments and to wait in the lounge.  The place was busy so not a huge deal.  After 15 minutes, she starts to seat us at one what was probably the worst table in the restaurant it, it literally shared a bench with the lounge not exactly what I was imagining for a cozy date night.  The boyfriend and I shared a \"Help!\" look and he asked her if any other tables were available she said if we wanted to wait 25 minutes she could seat us somewhere else.  And so we did, not the best start but after waiting we got a lovely little curved booth in the carpet area of the restaurant.  Moral of the story:  If you don't want to share your bench with the guy trying to hit on that one chick in the lounge specify where you want to sit when making a reservation.  For an appetizer I ordered the pear and endive salad, it was yummy but had far more frisee lettuce in then I was expecting for a salad that only listed endive and arugala.  Not bad just surprising.  The boyfriend  ordered the Alaskan King Crab and it was almost orgasmically good.  Three good size crab legs; definitely best part of the meal.  For our main course we shared the 14 oz bone-in filet (medium rare) and a side of lobster mac and cheese and the truffle parmesean fries.  The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare and looked beautiful.  It was tender, melt in your mouth quality meat except for the fact it had almost no seasoning.  I was so disappointed, for a steak house I expected more and it was just bland.  The fries were good though, the perfect amount of truffle.  Sadly the mac and cheese was just a total disappointment.  The boyfriend and I are total gourmet mac and cheese fiends and order it everywhere and this was definitely our least favorite we've ever had.  The cheeses used were really bland (once again, STK where's the flavor?) mozzerella and something else I think.  Try Holstein's truffle lobster mac 'n cheese, downstairs at the Cosmo, it's so much better.    We hoped to have room for dessert but unfortunately after the food and a bottle of wine we were too full.  Our bill was $274 before tax and tip ($100 bottle of wine) and while we were both stuffed we were somewhat less than satisfied, I don't think we'll be coming back again.",

We told him we were in a slight rush to catch a show and he immediately started telling us about their menu! He was very knowledgable when it came to what was on everything and was very entertaining! The young man who helped with our waters, Marcus, was on his game!!! My glass never was empty, which is a big deal to me. This all before we even got our food!!  The food was PERFECTION!!! We all ordered steaks and they were all cooked exactly as we had wanted! The sides were amazing as well! The Mac and Cheese...yumm!!!! I have never been so impressed by a restaurant and it's whole team as I was by the team at STK! You didn't see servers on their phones or messing around but you could tell everyone was having a good time! I will DEFINITELY be returning to STK on my next trip to Vegas!!! Nothing short of PERFECTION!!!!",

Well let's just say the place was empty and we waited 45 minutes before they came and got us.... in the meantime we watch many people walking in and was seated. By this time it was busy, we asked for the manager, he offered to comp or drink. But we decided not to eat there and we to a near by Restaurant.",

I was intrigued by how many hammered tourists rolled in and out of this place making out at the bar and dancing at their dinner tables. People watching for days while I chowed down on my steak. Entertaining to say the least. Classy restaurant Yes - clientele - not soo much :-/   All I know is my bone in ribeye steak from the specials was mouth watering tasty.   Creamed corn on point. Cream of spinach perfect. Grilled asparagus a little too charred for my personal liking.  Shoutout to our waiter who was AMAZING- I think his name was Chris. He needs to be a stand up comedian on the side he had us cracking up the whole night and was very hospitable. If I return I will definitely ask for him.",

Everything else is a matter of taste and preference, but please get the namesake right.  Other than being overcooked, the rest of us who received their steaks at our requested levels, were very disappointed at the lack of flavor, umami, and/or overall satisfaction.   The staff was professional, the vibe was what you'd expect in Vegas, and the sides were OK - but again, not what you'd hope for.   The desserts were the best part, but even the espresso was burnt. Although to be fair, we may have already had a bad taste in our mouth by that point.   Venture elsewhere if you're looking for an amazing steak experience.",

    "text": "I've known about STK for a few years now and heard they serve wonderful food and steak. I finally decided to test this rumor out during my vacation in Vegas and the quality of their meat rang True. My date and I ordered a medium fillet with truffle butter to share since we also wanted to try their glazed beef short rib and a few appetizers. This is by far the best steak I've ever had cooked for me, it melted in my mouth! I want to come back and try every topping. I don't eat red meat often but I actually crave this steak cause the quality exceeded my expectations so much; it's just that darn good!   The short rib was disappointing, I have complete opposite feelings about it. The server said it's slow cooked for about 18 hours or so, which made me think oh wow this must be good... but  unfortunately there was too much fat inside the meat to enjoy. It felt like I was eating lard and just looking at fatty pieces in each cut. I didn't touch it anymore after two bites.   The starters were simply amazing! We had the beef tartare, which was made just how it should be, and served with small, thin slices of toast. The day boat scallops came in two huge pieces wrapped in bacon, I was pleased. The yellow tail appetizer was my favorite one, there's a crunchy spicy kick to this and it's fabulous to start with. Every table also gets a thick brioche drizzled in their own in house delicious garlic butter/cheese type of sauce. This bread is so fluffy and gooey to eat. Better starve yourself for the whole day before coming to STK cause you'll want to eat it all!",

Our waiter \"Edward\" was great as well, very attentive and knew the menu very well. The two things I didn't really like about this place was the seating, and the food. The seating is VERY tight, we had a party of 6 and we were elbow to elbow, hardly any space to enjoy your entrees. The 2nd thing that I didn't really like was their food, I eat alot of steak and Im very familiar with each cut, the portions were generous, however, it did lack flavor. At $60 a steak, the food was very mediocre.. With all that being said, I would recommend this place to anybody looking to go to a pretty hip steakhouse that carries a good vibe.",

We let our waiter know we were catching a flight. Holy smokes, fastest service I've ever had at a steak place. By the 5-10min it took for us to wash our hands, food was served and meat was to perfection!  We had an excellent meal without the stress of rushing thru dinner to make it to the airport. Thanks STK!",

From the moment you walk in, you can see the classy but modern design of this restaurant and you can feel the perfect ambiance of the kind of place you go to for world class food and service.   Everything from the fresh bread to the most unique tater tots, the beginning was only a taste of what was to come. The seafood platter had perfectly chilled, insanely fresh crab legs, shrimp, and oysters with a flavorful ceviche that reminds me of what you would get at a Caribbean resort. Caesar salad is the kind of thing that stands out when you've got the perfect dressing, and that's what you get here. Sliders don't get enough credit for being superior burgers. Here, each bite is supremely measured, tender meat, a crisp tomato, melty cheese and a golden bun wrapping it all up.  The cocktail menu offers a great selection of interesting options. Of course, we ended up with an old fashioned - one Don Draper would be proud to drink.   Now, the steaks were cooked to utter perfection. Crisp, flavorful char on the outside that cuts into a masterfully precise tenderness that shows off how great the choicest cut of meat can be. Sauces to go with that only accentuate all of the other flavors make for an entree fit for kings.   To top it all off, sweet potato donuts glazed in a gooey rum caramel like sauce and vanilla ice cream. Accompanying this heavenly cake donut was a chilled espresso vanilla vodka shot that ended a most perfect meal.   Executive Chef Stephen Hopcraft has done an amazing job with his food craft here at STK. Thank you to our main server Isaac and to Christian, who gave us world class service. Our utmost compliments to the Chef, who blew us away with amazing food.   If you're ever in Las Vegas, be sure to visit STK for one of the best meals you'll ever have out here.  Cheers.",

From waitstaff and runners to Stephen Hopcraft's excellent menu with perfectly cooked bone in ribeye. We had a variety of appetizers... my favorite was the oysters (I have had the seafood tower before and it's amazing) and the waygu beef sliders melt in your mouth. While you eat the DJ plays the best music, a great mix which is loud enough to hear the great tunes but you don't have to yell to talk to the people your eating with. The desserts amazing.. the best are the doughnuts! Been coming here for years and never been disappointed.",

The girls at the front desk were not friendly, actually quite rude to us. They said we had to be wearing closed toed shoes which is never going to happen in Vegas since even my best pumps are open toed. This is just such a joke to me. You just lost 4 customers with the poor front desk service people you have working & when you have a restaurant in the middle of the mall you need to expect that people will be wandering around with shorts & thongs on in the middle of summer. Will never ever come back to this place. Walked over to mastros ocean club & were welcomed with open arms.",

We decided to make reservations because we knew it'd probably be packed which was a smart idea because when we got there it was super busy. Even though we did have reservations it took them another 10 minutes to take us to our table (which I noticed there were plenty of seats in that section for 2 people).   The bread that was complementary was amazing. I loved it and I usually don't eat complementary bread that comes with our dinners. Theirs just had this melted blue cheese on top and I love blue cheese.   The sides were a bit expensive for what we got though. I was hoping for more flavor if we were paying $15-$20 per side. We could be skipped them.  Me and my husband shared the 20 oz rib steak which was really good and it was cooked perfectly for us. The service was really fast and they even sliced up the steak for us before bringing it out since we were sharing. Definitely a place to try if you're a steak eater!",

We went to the bar and had a drink and waited. I watched as other parties came and checked in and were sat immediately. These were all white parties. When we had been waiting for over twenty minutes I went to check in with the hostess to see what the wait was, she said the wait time was an estimate and she was waiting for one party to sign their check. At this time, four other parties had been sat that checked in after us. I look to the front and they have all black parties waiting, and are seating white parties. After waiting for an hour they finally sat our party of three who had a reservation.",

The wine was the best thing we had. The lamb was under seasoned and the 10 oz filet with the king crab oscar I ordered (medium rare plus) was cooked to the correct temperature but was also under seasoned and underwhelming.  The manager Anthony had better customer service than the waitress and the hostess staff. Completely dismissive and inattentive. Don't waste your money unless you just want the experience.  Ther music was rather loud but did provide a good vibe.",

It took 3 tries to get a perfect steak.... First time it came out, the steak was literally well done. When I told our waiter, he blamed it on the lighting and said it looked well done because it was dark. No.... it was well done because it was cooked too long. After having to argue with him that it wasn't cooked correctly, he took it back and placed a new order. The second time the steak came out, it was rare and COLD inside. It was almost icey as if it was frozen. When I had to complain again, the waiter said there was no way the steak could be cold. I told him he should have a bite of the steak. Finally, on the third try (after the whole group has finished their meal and got an apology directly from the chef), I finally got a perfectly cooked medium rare ribeye. Third times the charm, but the steak was definitely amazing. It almost melted in your mouth.  Modern decor and ambiance of the restaurant was beautiful! If it wasn't for taking 3 tries and rude service from the waiter, I would have given STK a 5-star review.",

It was 6 pm and the place had just opened, I'm glad someone there knows how to simply make customers happy especially when they're not busy yet :0) also giving us a side of garlic made our dishes taste even better! Aside from that the food was expensive as usual, but worth it as always. You get what you pay for here! Best cooked steak , chicken and Veggies! I never get the sauces because I feel like the raw form of the main dishes taste amazing . Try making a reservation on busy nights.",

My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and it was truly amazing! We are both locals and in the industry so we have pretty high expectations. The service was quick and great. Our servers recommendations were great and we could tell he was truly interested in our satisfaction rather than just up selling. Wagyu mini burgers were so so good, a lil pricy but great!! I had the 6oz filet mignon w/truffle butter (which is a must). I don't really recommend the STK sauce it tasted like ketchup. While we were eating it did seem to fill up rather quickly and get pretty loud ... I wouldn't recommend for bigger parties unless you're trying to shout on top of each other but even with the place starting to feel up it still had a trendy chic ambiance. They also brought a cute little ice cream for us which I really appreciated! Overall a great place to try but get ready for that price tag that comes with it!   PRO TIP: If you're a local or driving in do not lose your ticket! It costs $30 for a lost ticket and they do not budge at all which is frustrating when you end up paying so much at dinner and parking attendants are RUDE. So I would actually just Valet and not even worry about a ticket!",

    "text": "This location has the shell of an STK but its staff (from front desk, to server, to manager) has the communication savviness of workers at your neighborhood Chilli's.  We CALLED to inquire about restaurant week tonight as it runs from June 19-30. The worker said that we could make a reservation for restaurant week tonight and it's also the last night. So we made the reservation. We even called back a second time to make sure that restaurant week menu was still available and the girl confirmed YES!  We arrived on time and the front desk girl said \"You made a reservation for restaurant week, but we don't do that menu on the weekend. But let me ask the manager if we can do it for you.\"  We didn't make the reservation ourselves and assumed that restaurant week was available. An STK staff MADE the reservation for us via the phone. A worker who one would assume knows how to do her job.  They eventually sat us and a few minutes a later, a manager came and said, \"gentlemen, I know YOU requested the restaurant week menu, but we don't do that on the weekends. I did ask the chef and he said that we would be able to do it tonight.\"  We had to correct him that WE didn't request the restaurant week menu out of nowhere, it was advertised! And that we called to confirm and it was confirmed. Therefore, we responded to advertisement that STK put out. As a manager, he shoulda just proceeded with the menu without the drawn out effort to let us know that they were doing us a favor. As a manager, he should know about ALL of the operations of the restaurant and made sure all staffs know how to answer questions about their specials.   On top of that, our server was super loud and obnoxious, one can hear him from across the room. He even told a patron NOT to order a item because it was expansive. Then when a patron asked him about the crab cakes, he responded, \"oh crab cakes are crab cakes, they're the same everywhere.\"  Oh jeez, the dining experience was just bizarre due to the pedestrian and unprofessional methods of communication by the staff.  But to the balance out the bizarre experience, the food was decently good. We felt it was a fair price. The chef even came out to compliment us with a side of asparagus. Thank you, chef!",

Had some nice negroni cocktails up in the bar while we waited for the rest of our \"always late\" party to arrive.  We started with the Shellfish Platter($40.00/person).  Oysters, shrimp, king crab and ceviche....the oysters were well-shucked and tasty, about two per person....shrimp, one per person, overcooked and tough, the crab was skinny and dry and the ceviche was a joke(garlic and citrus flavors were conspicuously weak), I had to ask for more chips, which were thin and poorly suited texture wise as an accompaniment.  Wedge salad next($16.00), too creamy, bacon was decent, but not of the best flavor/quality.  The dish was \"ok\"...was hoping for excellent.  Got the Free range chicken (maybe 1/3rd of small chicken) with polenta fries....it was exceptionally tasty, and a fabulous deal at $29.00.  Tried my friend's steaks and was glad I went with the chicken.  We shared broccoli, truffle fries and asparagus for the table, all $12.00 and all meh.  They did give me a complimentary chocolate mousse for my birthday, and the staff was very polite and professional, but by the time we were at dessert, I was ready to bolt, and have to say for Las Vegas steakhouses, this is a bottom tier player.",

The entire restaurant is very nicely done, doesn't feel like a \"steak house\". Has a modern feel and a great vibe. From the minute we checked in we were treated very well and each staff member we had contact with congratulated us on our 20 year anniversary. The waiter had great knowledge on all aspects of the menus (wine, cocktails, main food menu and dessert). He made a wine recommendation for my wife after asking her several questions on her taste preferences. My wife commented that it was the best wine she had ever had! He also had recommendations on the steaks and he was right on, both of our steaks were amazing! Of course he also had dessert recommendations and both of our choices were awesome. The staff made us feel like our anniversary was special and the food and atmosphere was amazing! I would highly recommend STK if you are visiting Las  Vegas and looking for an amazing meal and experience.",

Something special in that sauce.  I love when we share that they slice the steak.   It's super upbeat here.  With the DJ's it's like eating in a nightclub. Everyone who comes here is gorgeous.   I went to the first day of STK Brunch.  WOW!!!  pretty impressed.  They had a live cover band. She has a great voice.  Might be for the opening day but they also had a fortune teller.    One little thing, they served my coffee in  to go cup. Didn't feel it suited the caliber of this restaurant.  They also forgot the baileys.  Their cinnamon bread is soooooooo delicious. Just as addicting as their dinner bread.  This one comes with an icing!  Had their yogurt and granola.  Plated nicely but tastes as good as what I could throw together at home.  I probably wouldn't pay for it at this restaurant.  The pancakes were delicious and fluffy served with fruit and whipped cream.  Didn't even need syrup.  The smoked salmon was probably and overwhelming amount of fish in comparison to the rest of the ingredients.    I very much enjoyed brunch and am looking forward to coming again.  The servers were in their jammies.  Can we wear our pj's too?",

    "text": "We were 2 couples in Vegas celebrating a Birthday. I had to make a really tough decision not to go to Cut or SW(we have had several wonderful experiences there), and try STK for the first time. We were all really hoping to be impressed as we only had 2 nights in Vegas and both needed to be spot on. Our reservation was for 8:30, we arrived a few minutes early and the \"hostess\" (positively not a Maitre D') informed us they were running a little behind. No problem, we went to the bar for a few cocktails and glasses of wine and at 8:50 went back to the hostess. Was informed it was still going to be a while, and we asked for the manager. I wish I could remember this first manager's name, but his lack of professionalism and common courtesy made him all too forgettable (ZERO). His response was that it was not his fault people were staying too long at the tables in the dining room, no apology, no empathy, just a rude excuse. When he realized his poor management skills were not going to work on us, he stated he would have a table in 5 minutes. The hostess found us in 10 minutes and tried to sit us at a high top table in the bar!! Nope, not going to happen I told her. She went back to inform the manager (ZERO), and he actually attempted to have her try and sit us at another bar table again!!! I actually felt bad for the hostess, being that the cowardly, poorly spoken manager did not have the nerve to attempt to sit us there himself. We finally bypassed the hostess stand and sought out a different manager on our own. We were moments from walking out, but it was almost 9:30 at this point and we were starving and knew that it was too late too get in to one of the other great steakhouses. Then Clay (HERO), entered the situation. Professional management skills at their finest. Calmed us all down after taking the time in the middle of a very busy and loud bar to hear us out, empathize, and rectify the situation. I was feeling really guilty that my choosing this restaurant was going to ruin my friends birthday evening until Clay stepped in. He sat us at a wonderful table immediately, patiently stood at the table with us and personally introduced us to our 2nd Hero of the night James (our astute server), and Heath our 3rd Hero (a wonderful Sommelier). We were actually feeling quite vindicated and our temperatures were dropping significantly as Clay asked James to bring us 3 of their best appetizers, and asked Heath to get our bottle of wine to us as quickly as possible because we had a celebration that needed to begin ASAP. Clay apologized profusely again, said to ask for him personally should anything not be perfect, and excused himself politely form our table. We were in phenomenal hands the rest of the evening with James and Heath. The bottles of Wine were divine, the appetizers (which Clay took care of for us quite generously)were amazing, the steaks were spot on, and the lovely desserts (also taken care of by Clay, James, and Heath) were delectable. The table, the food, the company, and the atmosphere, along with the 3 \"HEROES\" turned a disaster in to the way a wonderful fine dining experience should be. STK, I beg of you to commend Clay, James, and Heath....and please quickly rectify the problem you have at the front door, as they almost cost you an $800 tab, and an important, memorable evening for us. We have dined at the best of the best all over, stayed at the best of the best all over, and have never been treated so poorly and so miraculously all in the same  evening. Thank you Clay!!

I'm pretty sure this might be at the top list of \"places to be seen in Vegas\". Ok, so who cares about the people, let's talk about the grub.  If you're looking for a place to grab a quality slab of meat, you're at the right place. The sides are that of a classic steak joint and generally hit the spot. Solid meal and much better than most of the generic / overpriced steakhouses on the LV Strip.",

    "text": "I evaluate restaurants on three metrics: food, service, atmosphere and price. Okay, that's four, but who's counting.   The atmosphere and service are great. The manager, Jesse, saw us walk in, asked if we had a reservation (we did not) and found a way to squeeze us in on a busy night. Real class act, super nice guy.   Our waitress could not have been nicer or more attentive. It is a bustling, fun, fast environment. The noise level is loud (in a good way), the place has a buzz. Even with that going on, our waitress was patient and understanding.   Unfortunately, I can't say great things about the food or price. I don't mind paying $100 for a steak dinner with a glass of wine, but it better keep me coming back for more.   I ordered my steak medium, it was raw in parts and not cooked very flavorfully. The cauliflower gratin (cauliflower, cheese, shaved almonds) was mediocre, at best.   My co-worker had the beef ribs, that dish was excellent. The best part of the meal was the Malbec (red wine). It was delicious, no doubt.   I'm willing to try this place again because I liked the service; hopefully the food will improve the next time we're there.",

I love a good steak and have been to many steakhouses, so I was excited to try STK.  I understand that the crowd in Las Vegas can be crazy sometimes and unpredictable.  However, my friends and I arrived dressed up and composed (sober) since this was the first stop of our night.  It was pretty noisy and lively in there, which we pleasantly expected, however, the hostess did not even acknowledge us when we walked in.  The vibe was unwelcoming and seemed like we were being burdensome to ask for a table.  I would expect that if we were annoyingly drunk, but we were patient and polite.   I got the bone-in rib eye and it was juicy and succulent.  We also ordered a side of potatoes, and they were a bit cold.  For the prices that I was willing to pay, I expected the potatoes to be warm at least!  I see potential in STK, but not sure if I would come again.  There are so many other places in Vegas to spend your winnings...",

We showed up 45 mins early and place was pretty empty...we were seated right away. Not sure why we couldn't make reservations for an earlier time since they had so many open tables?!?!?!!!  Positive: Service was great. Doughnuts were yummy.   I was really thrown off because I was expecting a nicer ambiance, than the one I experienced. They had a live DJ, which was cool, but music was so loud I felt I was in a club and not at a nice dinner. The food was also pretty poor. Lacked flavor. I tried the buratta, flank steak, asparagus, mashed potatoes and nothing made you crave more. Only must are the doughnuts.  I know this is Vegas and music fits the city, but this is more of a place for friends getting together, than a nice celebratory dinner with your significant other.",

There is nothing special about this place except for the fact that celebrities love it. If that is your thing, then you will like it. I have a hard time paying $900.00 for a meal that was below average and as soon as we were done, we were asked to leave because they needed the table and had over booked. WHAT?? Are you kidding me?  There are so many good restaurants in Vegas. Everyone in my group had a steak sides and appetizers. There was nothing that stood out. It was very loud, they have a DJ playing really good dance music if you are into that. If you ask the water they will give you a CD of the DJ. The only plus to this dinner.  I would recommend going somewhere else. Totally not worth the wait or the price.",

    "text": "Love, love, love this place! I've heard so many great things about Stk, but at first, I have to admit that I was a little bit hesitant to try it. Over here in LA, we have so many eateries and when we want a good steak and service, we always resort to Ruth Chris's.   My boyfriend and I made reservations to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. When I called the restaurant, I never told the hostess that we were celebrating anything and the next available reservation she had available was at 11:15. Ofcourse, it being a Friday night and in Vegas, we figured we could do a little bit of gambling at the casino before having dinner. We arrived at the restaurant around 11 and instantly, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the beautiful decor. Normally, the bf and I would want a nice, quiet environment   for dinner since we're in our early 30s (yes, we're old!), but we figured, why not since we're in Vegas. The restaurant was busy, but filled with good music. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. I've been to Vegas many times and usually, it takes a while for a male to order a drink. The kind bartender instantly noticed my boyfriend and helped us out. Customer service is one of the biggest things we value when we go out to eat and if a place doesn't have good customer service, we usually aren't returning customers.    The hostess sat us to our table and asked us if we were celebrating anything. We just responded that we were in Vegas for a wedding, but we decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and also celebrate our anniversary since we haven't been out in a while. Our server was named Luis acknowledged us immediately and served us some of their delicious and buttery bread. He explained to us the menu and also the sauces that we can add-on to our steak, if we wanted. I ordered the rib-eye, medium rare and the bf ordered the same thing. As sides, we ordered the broccolini and the mac and cheese.    Our food came out on time but I noticed that my steak was cooked more on the medium well as I cut into it. I normally don't like to complain, and I wasn't going to, but our waiter Luis noticed that our steaks weren't what we had ordered and wanted to make things right. He took back our steaks and had new ones made. While our steaks were being made, the bf and I just snacked on the broccolini since we were starving. As soon as Luis brought back our new steaks, he brought out some new sides because he wanted our sides to be warm for our steaks. He kindly apologized about the food and also brought us some shots.  Our steaks and our sides were absolutely delicious! The mac and cheese was creamy, the broccolini had a nice parmesan garlic flavor to it, and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I added a side of chimichurri sauce and that made my steak even more heavenly. As soon as we finished our meal, Luis found out from the hostess that we were celebrating an anniversary, and brought us a complimentary dessert! The desserts consisted of a warm apple crisp and a chocolate cheesecake. Both desserts were scrumptious and after eating there, I was afraid the zipper on my desk would rip! Lol. We ended up also chatting with another worker named Chris who gave us some recommendations on things to do that were nearby. He also explained how he enjoyed working at Stk because of how the staff feels like a family since they also hang out after work.   Luis and Chris, you guys are amazing! One of you told us that anyone who comes in is treated like VIP at Stk, and I truly believe it. The food and the customer service is why we will be returning to eat there in the future, every time we make a trip out to Vegas. Thank you for making our 4 year anniversary very memorable for the both of us!",

The  waitress was very sweet, but kind of slow when it came to taking orders. The food, however came out exceptionally quick. Music was pumping a killer mix, but too loud to have any sort of conversation. Hubby and I are foodies so we opted to try a bunch of small plates. The only one noteworthy was the squash risotto. It was divine! All the others were sub par, just the basic nothing special but not bad. The price tag however was insane and left still hungry. The oysters were the smallest I've ever seen, and for $18 a half dozen I felt ripped off. The Cosmo is a very cool, trendy casino but with that comes over priced restaurants and lots of people trying too hard. I was psyched about this place and its reviews, but it's so not something I'd be trying again. Still on the search for a perfect foodie location while in this town. 2 stars the expedited service and risotto only.",

All of the food was delicious and came out really quick. I ordered the filet as my entree and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was very good.

Could have been a little bit more smiley.. But the food was amazing :) worth every penny!",

They get rather packed most evenings so plan for a wait, or you can always grab some open seating in the bar.  I have enjoyed almost everything I have tried here. Although I am blanking on a name they serve an amazing bread appetizer with sides of dipping sauce. I want to say it is the foie gras french toast but do not quote me on that.  Aside from that I like the caesar salad (Traditional, but I like that it is prepared with large pieces of romain vs chopped, and with fresh parmesan) For entrees I really enjoy the sea bass (When it is offered) and the chicken. You can select your sides to accompany your entree, I recommend the mac and cheese (Creamy and tasty) truffle fries (So good!) Or the mashed potatoes. As a desert person, you know I have to put in my 2 cents on these. The espresso charlotte is amazing. I have also tried the cheesecake pops, which are rather simple but good non the less.  Overall I really like STK. Nice large menu offering a variety of tasty items, nice atmosphere, and good service.",

Obviously a meal this fantastic isn't cheap, but it was worth it, since we weren't hitting places like this every night.  We were able to score a prime table (thanks to my friend) and was immediately greeted.  We chose a nice bottle of wine, and off we went.  Everyone at the table ordered a petite filet, which was the perfect amount for a girl.  I've heard rave reviews about the bone in rib eye, but with all the sides we ordered, I just couldn't.  We also ordered the asparagus, creamed corn and mac and cheese with truffle and lobster.   The mac and cheese was the real star, absolutely mouth watering, and served in a cast iron skillet.  Coming from the South, this mac and cheese is in my top 3 easily.  Creamed corn was also very very tasty.  Service was outstanding, as I never wanted for anything.  Also, what I really liked about STK was the music.  This is the only restaurant I've ever experienced that I didn't know if I should eat or dance.  The DJ that was spinning was really really great.  STK is packed full of beautiful people just like the Cosmopolitan, so with the great food, great wine, kicking music and eye candy, your dining experience is complete!",

Soon thereafter, I felt so sick that I asked one of the guys to get me an ambulance.  Long story short, I spent my whole night violently puking the nasty food.  The next day I called my friend to apologize for the abrubt departure and he told me how he and several other guys vomitted all night.    Wasted vacation thanks to this dirty restaurant.  I appreciate YELP for having such a service so restaurants like this can get exposed.    Take the $2,000 plus you made that night on cleaning up your act.  Disgraceful.",

Our party of 5 showed up without a reservation around 7, 730pm and were seated within 10 minutes. Our drinks from the bar hadn't even arrived so they were brought to our booth.   Ambience was great, a DJ was spinning some excellent tunes (think Bennie and the Jetts) - although music was a bit loud for conversation.  I had the 10 oz. filet and my friend had the organic chicken. I loved the crust on my steak. The steak was tender and flavorful despite the fact that I opted out of any additional toppings/sauce for my steak (I'm a purist). The chicken was very soft and moist, although the portion was very small.  We shared sides: -mac and cheese (standard, nothing special. I consider myself a mac  n cheese connoisseur and I like a good crispy crust with cheesy al dente pasta but this was more a creamy white concoction that I wasn't in love with) -parmesan truffle fries (not shoe string but more like perfectly rectangular steak fries, stacked kinda like jenga. pretty good but again, nothing to die for) -roasted carrots (baby yellow and orange market carrots - delicious, tender, flavorful) -mushroom pot pie (presentation was great. They bring it out in it's little pot, cut around the top of the crust and dump the dish out upside down onto another plate. Presentation was better than the flavor - basically different mushrooms in a creamy sauce, but still fun.)   Overall: my steak did it for me. I'd go back.",

We also ordered the truffled mac and cheese, the spinach, bok choy and the parm truffle fries.  All of the sides were good, but the mac and cheese and the truffle fries were my favorite.  The bread is really good too.  The biggest problem that we had was that we were sitting under a speaker, so there was no way to have any discussion during our meal. The music was very loud, it was like eating dinner in a nightclub. Our server seemed a bit impatient when waiting for our order, but our group was indecisive, and he just kept throwing ideas for what we should order out. Once we put our order in, we didnt see him again until it was time to pay.   If the service was better and they turned the music down, they would get a better rating.",

There were a few tiny hitches however George the GM was incredibly authentic in his management style which we completely appreciated and his approach to seeing his restaurant as successful was very appealing.   One thing you must know is that the 80's music is loud.  If you are of the age that enjoys that period, you will find it hard NOT to chair dance or mouth the words to many favorite songs.  Some actually had to get up and dance!  Great to go with friends for a fun night out.  Maybe not appropriate for a dinner meeting... I don't think you'd get any work done.  It's new... give it a try, your taste buds will be happy!  And ask for James as your server.  You will be pleased you did.",

One word: silverware. You'll be amazed by how cool it is! The staff on hand was excellent; beautiful people, most of which could also carry a highminded conversation.   The food: The monkey bread is from another planet, where they specialize in making really, really good bread.. You'll want to eat two or three of those. I didn't ask for more, it was one of my regrets upon leaving! I order a small filet, scallops and broclini as a side. I requested the filet be cooked to medium rare (as most steaks should be!). The filet was pink and red throughout the steak...not cool. The chef forgot about the order of scallops. They appeared 10 minutes after chomping down on the steak. I only ate one of the two.   The drinks: Wow, Grey Goose Martini with Blue Cheese filled Olives? Try it, you will be amazed.  Perhaps I visited on an off night? Since the Cosmopolitan is newly up and running, I understand that STK is not at peak performance yet. For the price I paid, I can say that I expected more. Though I would give STK another opportunity, but only after they've gotten all the kinks out. Given the right amount of TLC and hard work by those controlling the operation, STK could reach its' potential as one of the best restaurants on the strip. Cheer's to being an optimist.",

Despite being... less than creative with ingredients, the menu here is logical, which lauds mucho applause from this happy camper. Being in Vegas, the atmosphere here is also fittingly silly and sheik @ once.   Parmesan truffle fries are amazing(and I usually despise potato dishes @ nice places-they're cheap). The apps were the low point of the evening, hit and miss. Two friends and I had the lobster cocktail, which tasted like it'd been caught far, far away prior to a flavor-draining odyssey. But, wait.. the Crab Salad saved the day and turned things around. A collective exhale henceforth graced the table.  I had the filet: score.  My friend had a market fish which ended a drought of good seafood experiences since leaving recent travels to CA: score  Dessert was skipped for a seat at the posh bar, where cocktails are strong.  All in all, this place deserves four stars for ambiance. Vegas gets old easily, but this is a great place to take guests you want to impress. And did I mention I llllove it's sexy, futuristic atmosphere. Futuresexlovesounds all the way!",

You are paying $100-200 per person so you dont want to spend the whole evening keeping to yourself. My friends wife was asked if she wanted a drink and she kept saying \" Ill have the sea bass, yes Ill have the sea bass\" because she could not hear a word. Made for great laughs but not for great ordering or conversation.",

Yes, the music is really loud but as the night progresses and people start having a good time the volume becomes oddly appropriate. STK would be a great choice for a bachelor party or a fun night out with a group of friends.   I had a bone-in ribeye which was excellent. The sides were so-so but I've never really cared for such distractions anyways. Give me my bloody piece of meat and get out of the way!",

I think you have to be have to be ready to party when you come here. The bar area had a very social feel which was nice to have before sitting. We went there since our \"table wasn't ready\" but I think its by design to get us to grab some drinks at the bar before sitting. I say that because when we sat down there was a few open tables that appeared to not be filled for awhile. Our server was fast and on point with good knowledge of the menu. My ribeye was cooked to my medium rear liking with a nice sear on  the outside just like I like it. Mashed potatos were fantastic. They did under cook one person at our tables filet mignon, but he was too polite to send it back to be cooked longer. Steakhouse usually error on that side so they can always throw it in longer. The point off for the visit was strictly because they didn't serve prime steak, but charged \"prime\" prices. The steaks were angus though a very tasty! I'm going to Orlando in March and hope to eat at their new place down there too!",

    "text": "As a local and hearing all the rave we had to try it. The ambiance is nice and the music makes it an upbeat environment. The oysters Rockefeller were the best thing to hit the table. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and it was bland, the mushrooms were soaked in grease and pulled away from all the flavor along with the beef itself being non-flavorful. The egg and kimchi understandably add to the flavor but without (for those who don't do spicy) it's just chopped up raw beef with barely any seasoning or spice. We ordered 2 steaks with truffle butter and they were just basic. I get it, you get what you pay for but the truffle butter didn't even melt because the steaks weren't hot enough. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese which was way over salted to the point we couldn't eat it unless we skipped on the crust on top. The chunks of lobster were present, do not be dismayed. But for the dish itself less salt would've gone a long way. We also ordered the sauteed spinach which was simply steamed and not sauteed. Even after adding salt and pepper it was still not to the point to where we could eat it. We informed the server assistant we didn't care for it, and he removed the full dish of spinach from the table(but alas by from the bill). Let's go to the cocktails.....bland no flavor and just over priced liquor. The strawberry crumble itself was a flavorful cocktail minus the rim. Had the graham cracker rim been applied with perhaps simple syrup instead of lime, it could've been enjoyed that much more. The tequila and cider (I enjoy both components) just tasted as straight repasado tequila with a splash of blackberry. The cider wasn't apparent.  The bill hit and we were slightly shocked by the total bill. Expected to pay less but things add up quick I suppose. The server only came by 3 times all night, however the server assistant Pancho was amazing, he alone deserves 5 stars. There are so many steakhouses on the strip to choose from and after hearing the hype of STK, I feel it is only for the apps and before party drinks at the bar and to enjoy the in-house DJ. We truly wanted to love STK.",

The room is nice and makes it easier to have conversation since you can control the volume and the restaurant sometimes gets a little bit loud.

    "text": "My fiance and I chose STK as the steakhouse we would eat at to celebrate Valentine's Day and our Anniversary. We have been to many steakhouses in Las Vegas (both of us are born and raised) and this was a steakhouse that neither of us has been to so we decided to go. We got sat in the \"loud\" part of the restaurant - I read reviews about the restaurant being loud but I never imagined that it would be that bad. My and fiance and I couldn't hear our own conversation. The waiter couldn't hear our food/drink order. However, I wouldn't be leaving this negative review if that was the worst thing that happened to us during our dinner because we can handle a loud atmosphere. Our time at STK continued to get worse and worse. Our waiter, Joe, provided us with the worst service I could ever imagine. Bread was delivered to our table 10 minutes before our drink orders we taken and 20 minutes before our food order was taken. Our drinks took forever. I ordered a glass of red wine and my fiance ordered a Blanton's Old Fashioned. The Old Fashioned was poorly made - you think a bartender would put some attention into a $29 drink. His drink was overfilled and watered down with crushed ice. It was clear that the bartender puts zero pride into what he does. A food runner brought us our food less than 10 minutes after we ordered it.  Which was very bizarre. I don't know of any restaurant that can prepare 2 steaks, a lobster tail, mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach in less than 10 minutes...unless this food is being mass produced in the kitchen and is not made to order. The food runner asked who ordered the skirt steak. Neither of did. But he decided to put the skirt steak down in front of me.  My fiance ordered a filet and lobster tail - there was no butter or lemon with the lobster tail. And the lobster tail was hardly a lobster tail. It was the smallest, most pathetic lobster tail I have ever seen. My fiance and I actually laughed at it. The presentation of both of our meals was terrible - my filet looked like a hamburger patty. Our waiter NEVER came to ask us how our food was. The food was mediocre. The bread was only thing worth the money because it was great (funny because it's free). My steak had the quality of a grocery store steak. The creamed spinach was really green...typically creamed spinach is green (obviously) with white creamy sauce throughout. This creamed spinach was so bizarre. It was almost like this creamed spinach was old and the green from the spinach was bleeding into the white sauce. Or maybe STK has a different recipe for their creamed spinach, I don't know. The creamy Yukon potatoes were good. We decided to push through our terrible service and food and not let either of those things ruin our special day.  But it continued to get worse! I saw Joe walk passed our table countless times without ever checking on us. At one point he even looked at my empty wine glass - but kept moving. A food busser cleared our table. We sat with empty drinks for about another 15 minutes. We decided to skip dessert because at that point, we really just wanted to get out of there. Joe handed me a dessert menu and we declined. It took Joe 24 minutes to bring us our $230 bill. I insisted that my fiance ask for a manager to complain but he refused because it would have just made our night worse having to take it to that extreme. My fiance's credit card sat on our table for another 10 minutes before a waiter (who was not our waiter) came and grabbed it.  In conclusion, our food and service was not worth $230. It's awful that my fiance and I woke up today and the first thing we said to each other was how terrible our dinner was.  That is what prompted me to write this review.  If you want to spend over $200 at a steakhouse, please message me and I can give you some great recommendations.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I chose to have her mothers 50th birthday at STK because according to reviews this steak house offered exactly what we were looking for, great food and a night life feel. Our excitement was quickly put on hold when my girlfriend called to ask basic questions about what sections of the restaurant were available for a party of 10. We spoke to a hostess who went by the name of Special and with every question we asked she made it clear by her dry and unhelpful responses that she had better things to do. I have been in the service industry for 6 years now and my girlfriend for 3, so we knew not to prejudge a new restaurant off of a very unsatisfactory phone call with a hostess. I figured hey, let me just call and ask to speak to a manager that way all my questions will be answered in a PROFESSIONAL manner but I was told by the hostess there was no manager available for another hour! That was my sign to find another restaurant but her mother was pretty set on spending her birthday at STK.  Our reservation was for 6:15 and there was not a single table available for us at the moment so we waited at the bar while the rest of our party arrived. 45 minutes later the host told us he had a section available but we had to be finished eating in 90 minutes because they would need those tables for another party. Thats right, not only did we have to wait 45 minutes for a table, we were then given a time frame which we had to get up and leave. UNREAL. Not a SINGLE manager came an offered an apology to us for our inconvenience which I found very confusing.   I really need to give our server Mags a huge shout out because she made everyones dinning experience a great one. I am a server myself and I always appreciate great service wherever I eat because I know GREAT servers are a minority not a majority. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was better than we anticipated. Our night did not end on the happy note stated above unfortunately. As we are in the process of paying my girlfriend noticed a couple of managers staring in our direction and it was clear they were not only observing us but that they were frustrated. Moments later we were finally approached by the manager and his exact words were \"I will buy you all a round of shots if you leave this table because we need it for another party\". Let me remind you that we were literally in the process of paying our $1400 tab. Never in my life did I think I would be approached by a manager offering free alcohol to PAYING customers to leave a table to accommodate someone else, especially after we were sat 45 minutes late.   From beginning to end, with the exception of our server Mags our experience with STK was a disaster. I held back on even writing a review about our experience because it seemed better to just chalk it up as an \"L\" or lesson learned. However, I can't help but take it personal especially since it was my girlfriends mom 50th birthday. As a local we could have chosen any other restaurant far away from the money driven strip but we chose to go out of our comfort zone and treat our family and friends to an expensive dinner. To spend so much money in one place and not feel like your business is neither wanted or appreciated is really a let down. To the extremely unresponsive hostess to the manager staring at us across the bar so we would move quicker this is a dinner I will always remember for all the wrong reasons.",

The ingredients tasted FRESH and I was thoroughly satisfied from the steak (one of the best steaks I've had= solid), brocollini (savory hints of garlic and lemon), and parmesan truffle fries (thick cut & tasty).

    "text": "The only reason I give 1 star is that 0 stars isn't an option.  This has been one of the worst experiences that I have ever had with a restaurant, and my issues go all the way back to October 2017.  I made a reservation for a team event (12 people) and requested a private room.  Upon arrival to the restaurant, on time, we were told that we wouldn't be getting a private room, no big deal, but also that it would be a bit of a wait.  So, we waited 45 minutes, and we were finally seated in the bar area, which is like a nightclub essentially, due to the volume of the music and the small high-top tables.  I did ask the hostess for a more quiet table further back from the opening, but I was told that wasn't an option.  Still no big deal, we were having a good time to that point.  We proceeded through the meal, had many cocktails, wine, apps, dinner, etc.  It was serviceable, not great, especially for the price, but hey, you're in Vegas and things are overpriced.  This is where it turned from an ok time due to the company (nothing restaurant related) to indescribable.  When it came time to order dessert, we were told that we needed to hurry as they were closing soon.  So, I ordered an espresso, several team members ordered a dessert and coffee.  As they arrived, we were told we had 2 minutes to eat and go and I was presented with the check and asked to pay it immediately.  I asked to finish my espresso and the server huffed and stood over me while I drank it.  I handed her my card, and she asked if we could get up and she would bring me my check at the door.  No one finished their dessert, and we were ushered out while still trying to grab jackets, belongings, etc.  BTW, there were still people at other tables in the restaurant.  I paid the tab, with 0 gratuity, which is what was deserved for the way we were treated throughout the evening, and I asked to talk to a manager.  I was told there were no managers on duty at this time.  Here's where it gets even better, the restaurant has charged my card for an additional $400 that I didn't authorize, essentially forcing the gratuity onto me even though the receipt I have signed clearly shows $0.  I have called the restaurant over a dozen times, each time a manager is not available, I have provide the receipt multiple times and cannot get a single returned call from a manager.  I have disputed this charge with Amex 3 times now, with the restaurant calling them back and providing False claims to try to keep the charge.  In the latest round they sent Amex a receipt with my signature showing the amount I actually paid, but then stuck an itemized receipt with gratuity, making it look like I actually signed the receipt with the higher amount.  This is what is known as fraud!  The fight will continue until STK does the right thing.  Obviously I will never return to this establishment again, and while I am not the type of person to fight this type of battle over social media and/or the internet, I don't want anyone else to receive this type of service while at dinner or after...",

Cocktails were so-so, a bit light-handed on the gin. Pinot noir 'cherry pie' was great.   Tried 14oz dry-aged delmonico rib eye steak with truffle butter. Great flavor!  Only a bit over-cooked for a medium rare.  The filet medallion 8oz was perfect. Side greens all tasted great - broccolini, bok choy, and sauteed spinach.  Finished with flourless chocolate cake.",

It was a party of 10 which we were in the private room.  with my meal I had the creamy corn and lobster Mac and cheese with the lobster thermadore. The Mac and cheese were completely burned tasting and the lobster wasn't as juicy tasting. The shrimp cocktail was pretty good. I felt bad telling anyone that I wasn't happy with my meal. We had so much of a good time laughing that I just didn't bother with it.  I did let my friend taste the Lobster Mac and cheese and indeed it was burnt. Didn't have the donuts which was more disappointing.   Fast forward two days, I came again for a birthday party 9 of us total. We waited for an extremely long time but no one complained as it was more of catching up and trying to make the best of things. We were greeted and a deepest apologies along with the best service ever. We had the tuna tartare, spicy crab, shrimp cocktail. All amazing!!! Ginger mojito was pretty good if I do say so myself.  Now for the dinner. Each had something different as the other two days ago, I did however let the server know about my service and he assured that it will not be the same. So I got the same dinner, lobster thermadore but the server mentioned that he will put everything on the side. I also ordered creamy corn and mushroom pot pie from the recommendation of the server. Of course the creamy corn is always delicious and oh my gosh the mushroom pot pie was sooo gooooood, that will be a new one for me. The lobster was so good and nothing like two days ago. Which was so weird as we had the chef come and greet us. But this meal was totally different from two days ago. Loved my dinner. We had everything from Delmonico,, tuna, filet, salmon, chicken. Everyone had different sides and funny thing someone had the lobster mac and cheese and I tried it again from the Vegas location and it was wayyy better than two days ago. Scooooooorrreee!! Dessert, unfortunately they ran out of donuts but they let us get a run down of the other deserts many fail to see due to the yummy donuts. We had the flourless cake, strawberry shortcake, ice cream cookie and let me tell you. I will from now on order a desert even if they do not have donuts. Oh gosh I cannot tell you which was better as everyone was so good. I literally was asking everyone if they weren't going to finish their dessert. I had the liberty of getting the final bite. I will say definitely order each one if it's a big enough crowd as all are so good.  I was so happy I decided to come back and give a second opinion to let you guys know that Vegas location is equally as fun as the other ones and just as yummy with an awesome staff. Saban I believe his name was so awesome apologized for the wait and a definite awesome person.",

Thankfully the DJ had a great playlist going!   We ordered the beef tartare....so good. I could've eaten more!  We each ordered different style steaks, but they were all cooked to perfection! My filet melted in my Mouth like butter....and I added amazing truffle butter to just make it better!   It would've been 5 stars but the sides we ordered (mashed potatoes and truffle fries) were ok...your usual run of the mill sides. Was hoping for the price, they'd be excellent.  Service was great. Props to the servers for being able to be so attentive with all the loud noise and action going on!  It's definitely a very Vegas style steakhouse, but it's a must try at least once!",

    "text": "Features: -We came here in a group of 7 people and got seated within 20 minutes.  We were all really excited for this restaurant even though we have one in LA.  We ordered several sides that were flavored really well.  The first was the creamy yukon potatoes, this was good, not too dry.  My favorite was the sweet corn pudding.  This was really flavorful and like the name says, sweet.  The mac and cheese was okay, this was nothing original so I would not recommend this really.  The mushroom pot pie was scrumptious, all my friends really liked it.  Enough to order a second one at least.  -I had the medium filet which I wanted medium cooked and boy was this juicy and appetizing.  There's a reason why this place is known for their steaks!  I don't think any other place can make their steaks better than STK.   -At the end of the meal, we each had an expresso shot.  Let me say this, their expresso kept me up all night!  Lol!  This was a great dining experience, so hope you get to enjoy this place!  Improvement: -It took a little less than 20 minutes to seat up but preferably, since we made reservations, we wanted to be seated right away.  Tips: -The bread they give you was delicious and soft, it came in this green dipping sauce that was really good.  Make sure to have a little of that before your big meal! -The portions of the steaks were sized depending on what size you order but we shared a medium between two people and we were stuffed.",

So far, the dining experience was dismal at best.  However, server salvaged it. Talked to her Mgr, he came by and apologized. Got us 3 new entrees (properly cooked), then the chef came out and chatted us up for a bit (and apologized). They then brought out 3 complimentary desserts for us, then knocked off 25% off the entire bill which was a complete surprise.   I give them mad props for being service oriented, cordial, and squashing our dining issues immediately. Had the food been cooked properly from the get go, I'd have gladly given them a well deserved 4 Stars. Perhaps next time.",

Long story short, the hostess made every attempt on getting us to leave. Our reservation which was made 2 weeks prior wasn't honored, we were shuffled around the dinning area because the hostess confused two groups, one of 4 other of 5 (our group and the other only had one thing in common). They seat us at a bar table. This was my best friends 40th birthday, which I noted on the reservation... I've sat at the bar for many years with 40 years plus on this earth, I couldn't stand for it!!    After my complaint, they then seat us in the back by the kitchen. The waiter was witty so we decided to stay... We order, receive our food - all of it was cold and had to be sent back (at this point we hoped for the best, but really should've left). It was so bad that one person in the party just opted not to eat. (Very sad face)  The waiter was great (sorry didn't catch his name) ...we really appreciated him for making up for the hostesses many attempts on trying to get us to leave. It's unfortunate this happened because I raved to my friends on how much I loved this place... :(",

There was 4 of us so we got a whole bunch of sides, which were family style. I would recommend the mashed potatoes, truffle fries, Mac N cheese. We had the bread pudding for dessert which just melted in my mouth. Has to be one of the best desserts I have ever had.

The description suits this restaurant since it is conveniently located one level above Marquee Nightclub.  If you're a health nut then this place is not for you as most items on the menu are super rich in flavor and sauces and/or grease.  On the most recent trip I had the 10 oz loin steak as entree plus sides of the sweet corn pudding, mushroom pot pie and Parmesan truffle fries.  Appetizers we had were the crispy lobster tails, lil burgers and a tomato caprese salad.  All in all the meal was quite satisfying but definitely a bit overpriced as the bill came out to around $250 for the three of us but I guess the atmosphere makes up for it.  Only issue I have is sometimes the music is too loud and makes it hard to have a conversation while dining.",

STK is a nice, simple name for a venue when you're texting a group of 15 dudes on a bachelor party for a Saturday night dinner. Let's face it though, any decent steakhouse located in the Cosmo would be killing it right about now regardless of the restaurant caliber. Granted this place is better than average in food quality, ambiance and eye candy, it does lack in service. Sure your server will possess pulchritude and a coquettish demeanor but she'll forget to bring your app or drink, after the 10 minutes you had to wait to flag her down.  Whatever though, it's the place to see and be seen in Vegas, if you can get a table for your party, that is. In our predicament, we had to haphazardly stroll in in groups of three or four; and that was only to talk our way into geographically undesirable bar tables (since we couldn't get an after 6 reso for the big group).   The Lamb Chops I ordered made for a solid entree. Albeit my long-time bias to skirt steak, I don't think the price break (comparatively speaking) was worth going with that carne asada option. Also the complimentary bread here is awesome.",

I give 2 stars because me and my girlfriend enjoyed the ambience, our server was nice and because of a few food items that were good. I ordered the 34oz Bone-in Rib Eye to share with my girlfriend and it was very bland and slightly dry. The rib eye was so bland that I had to use the STK sauce which I did not like either!! My girlfriends Market special fish was unique but she was not impressed. The market fish was so unimpressive that she did not finish it!!! Same goes with the green beans that we ordered, extremely bland!!! We only ate a small portion of the green beans that we received because they were horrible!! The corn pudding and truffle fries were the only items that we enjoyed in our experience!!!! Overall, to pay high prices and to not get high quality food in return left me very discouraged and disappointed. I will not be returning!!!!",

There is a bathroom outside of the restaurant but it's too far.  I was standing in mine to use the bathroom and when I commented on the one bathroom issue and this local lady just got all protective and started yapping about how there is another bathroom outside and it's just fine to have one bathroom and all; ok lady take a chill pill. It still does not change the fact that a restaurant like STK has only one bathroom.  LA STK rules baby. No matter what you say.",

We had a couple of drinks there over the weekend, they didn't have cocktail waitresses serve at the lounge area, with $18-22 each specialty cocktails there, I would like to have some service over drinks..... at least the drinks were yummy and strong.  Decor / Ambience: 4 Food: 5 Service : 3.5  Total bill for 2 with 2 martinis no desert: $216  A small restaurant, seatings are kind of crowded, especially for 2 people, I saw many people got uncomfortable with their seats.  But at least it was intimate enough. It is also not a bad idea to eat at the lounge area if you don't make reservations.  Our food:  Complimentary bread with special house dipping sauce: sooo yummy! one of the best I've ever had  Dozen fresh oysters : so fresh and yummy with special house sauce and cocktail sauce  Dungeness crab salad: not much salad, but the dungeness crab was so delicious  10oz Fillet Mignon: delicious, perfectly cooked to medium rare with red wine sauce  Big eye tuna: soooo delicious! cooked perfectly to medium rare with wasabi mashed potato  Mushroom pot pie: yummy! the portion was like an appetizer   Food was so delicious, flavorful enough without saltiness. Lemon drop martini was good, Grey Goose dry martini was strong, you can choose stuffed olives or regular ones.   The service was just above average for an expensive fine steakhouse, we weren't very impressed. But he did a good job, friendly, fast and somewhat attentive.   Loved the food, not so much for the entire dining experience. But still a sexy restaurant for a sexy dinner date sometime.",

    "text": "So my latest steak escapade lead me here and the whole night I felt like I was cheating on Craftsteak and in the end I almost felt like going there to apologize on hands and knees.  It certainly wasn't horrible by any means, but can't say it was knock my socks off good either. They start you off with a chunk of bread that is lathered in a blue cheese butter which I admit was a twist, but misses the mark all around. It just made the bread a moist salty concoction of PASS (at least for me).  I decided upon the skirt steak and I asked for medium rare to get ultimate flavor, but I'd have had better luck just licking the cow on the pasture instead..I did like the seasoning in certain bites, but it disturbed me that every bite tasted different then the one before and it was a little disheartening that the steak was a bit tough at times. As a side I dove into the lobster mac n cheese which definitely saved the meal for me. It was actually plentiful with the lobster portion and honestly just tasted like heaven in my mouth.  The overall service and wait staff were left with high numbers, but ultimately steak in Vegas will lead me back to Craftsteak. They are my chopping block for which to compare all others to and sorry STK you rolled snake eyes!",

I had the skirt steak with Chimmichuri sauce.  The meat was cooked to medium even though I asked for rare.  The mac and cheese did not have the punch or taste to make it delicious. It was really blan tasting. Drink prices were very over priced $13 for a Stella beer... I could buy a 12 pack for the price.  Service was excellent, they are geared to get you in and out as quickly as possible.  Overall not one of my favorites in Vegas.",

So we waited.. and got our drinks. And waited.. and got some bread.. And waited.. And waited.. And waited.. For our steaks which were pretty damn good, just not worth the wait!   Not the best steakhouse in town but its got a chic atmosphere and serves some good beef. I don't mind the loud music, coz the DJ, yes DJ, was throwin' on some pretty dope tracks.

In fact, after a few drinks we were begging the waiter to let us change the soft music coming out of the speakers! The steak was, as expected, quite good, and the sides (truffle mac and cheese and spinach) were delish. The oysters on the other hand...were not shucked well...the had sand in every single one of them...which of course was rather disappointing. I alerted the waiter and he was extremely apologetic and removed them from the bill which I appreciated.   Overall, my experience at STK was nice (great food and great service)..minus the oyster hiccup (still..it was pretty gross). I wouldn't object if someone wanted to come back to STK but it would not be my first choice either. There are plenty of other fabulous places to eat in Las Vegas that come without a side of \"ocean floor\"",

The waitress was top notch, she even took my twins over to the DJ so they could see how things work!  Now on to the food...  Only one person ordered a salad (I forgot which one) but loved it!  I had the Lobster Cocktail which had just the right amount of kick from the horseradish and vodka.  For side dished we ordered Sweet Pudding Corn, Parmesan Truffle Fries, Mac & Cheese, and Spiced Maple Carrots.  All of which were simply amazing.  For steaks we had 4 bone in Filets (Best steak I've had in years), 2 bone-in Rib Steaks, and 1 Filet Medallion.  They were all cooked to the perfect temp, seasoned perfectly, and served piping hot.    For dessert they had an off the menu item which we tries which has a homemade mint chocolate chip sandwich served with homemade whipped cream and chocolate sauce for dipping.  The homemade mint ice cream was the star of the show.  I've never had ice cream before with such a great flavor of mint!  We also ordered the STK Cones which were good but nothing like the ice cream sandwich.  It's not cheap ($750 with tax and tip and we only had about 6 beers total) but worth it!",

Drinks were bought for us and somewhere in there the bride grabs us and we head to our table... huh .. but I was having fun there !... but at the table we enjoyed a bunch of appetizers, a king crab salad, rice crispy shrimp in a spicy broth, fresh oysters and I was full.

Fast forward to my more refined 26-year old palette that still orders her steak medium but most definitely sans the well.  My best steak experience to date was at STK in Las Vegas. Incredibly busy on Halloween weekend we were seated at the perfect table in the middle of the room (great for people watching.)  We started with salads - me: a caprese, my two companions ordered the beet salad and the romaine salad which they both enjoyed. Next we moved onto the main event. I could not resist and ordered the 10oz filet with a glass of Malbec. Let me tell you. That was the best steak I have had in....forever.  My friend Kiana ordered the Alaskan King Crab and Ashante, the Roasted Dover Sole, all of us? In heaven!  We also ordered sides of truffle macaroni and cheese and grilled asparagus. Each equally wonderful complements to our entrees.   We were so full (yes we ate the bread at the beginning of the meal too)  that we almost begged off from dessert. Heath our AMAZING waiter decided otherwise and out came the STK Snickers.   There really are no words for this dessert because delicious does not  begin to describe what went through my mind during consumption.  This was definitely one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. Not only was our waiter attentive, witty and thorough  with his suggestions, management also came by to say hello and check on us.",

We had the mushroom risotto, parmesan truffle fries, skirt steak, crab, and this brownie dessert - all were super delicious!   Waiter brought the wrong drink for my bf, but brought him the correct one quickly and comped it from our bill.   Overall food=great, service=great, experience=great.  I would definitely come here again for a special occasion.",
