Zero wait for table or bar, so we went for the bar. The chef is super friendly and everything we ordered fresh and delicious.   I tried some rolls I'd not seen before - like the muscle buster that had crab and a dumpling inside the roll with spicy tuna and avacado on the outside.   We will definitely come here again and bring out of town guests!!",

I didn't find anything unique on the menu... it's a pretty standard run of the Las Vegas \"funny roll names\" you find everywhere, with a few chef's specials.  The all-you-can-eat and lunch specials are reasonably priced. It's supposed to be $21.95 for AYCE dinner, but somehow the check graduated to $27+.  Since my last review, I would say the wait staff has been getting worse. They are inattentive and seem grouchy about taking the AYCE orders... in fact, our table had to kind of flag them down aggressively.",

    "text": "We were running errands in the Summerlin area, so I checked Yelp to find an AYCE sushi place nearby. Naka Sushi was highly recommended, so I thought we'd give it a shot. Although it's not the best sushi I've ever had (or even the best AYCE sushi I've ever had), this was moderately priced and offered a wide selection of sushi, rolls, and side dishes.  We arrived around 5, and there were plenty of open tables. This was a plus, because service was fast and our servers were super attentive. My husband and I split everything: from poke salad and edamame, to eel sushi and a variety of rolls. The caterpillar and rainbow rolls were my favorite, and although the TED and Muscle Buster rolls were good, they were HUGE -- it was a struggle to eat a piece in one bite.  I know the food was fresh, because I saw the chefs making it, but some of the fish seemed a little \"off.\" It also seemed like some of the cold rolls were a little too warm, and some of the warm food was a little cool, but maybe that's just me. I liked most of our choices, and for $22 each, you can't really complain.  It seemed like most of the other customers were regulars, because the staff greeted many of them by name, so it's obvious this place is doing something right. Overall, Naka seems like a solid choice if you're craving sushi (for a reasonable price) in the Summerlin area.",

    "text": "This may not be saying much because I am not a fan of Vegas, but Naka Sushi was the highlight of my trip out to Nevada last weekend. As a local, my cousin has talked about this magical place where you can eat your fill for $22.95 a person for quite some time now. And it might nauseate you to know that four people finished all the food we ordered, but we did it because who wants to pay additional for leftovers? Not me!  We deduced that they must use cumin in their frying batter, which gives the chicken karaage and the fried oysters really interesting flavor. And that soft shell crab is pretty ridiculous. The albacore, yellowtail, and salmon sushi were each fresh and delicious. The rolls were a little on the heavy side, especially those featuring their signature yum yum sauce, but all were exactly as described. Though we were limited to just one a person, the fresh oysters were fantastic. My favorite thing may have been the spicy baby octopus. And let us not forget that they have tempura ice cream and tempura banana on the menu for dessert, which I let other people order so I could steal bites. I opted for their daily special mint chocolate chip mochi ice cream, which was heavenly.  If you're not super hungry and just want a couple of rolls to split, this place seems like a great option for that as well. But I have to believe I will be here every time I found myself out that way if only for the love of a bargain.",

I feel more confident with this self proclaimed title now that I have come to Naka Sushi.   What makes Naka stand out in my oh so worth while opinion is the price to quality ratio going on over here. at 21 dollars or less for either lunch or dinner AYCE your making yourself look really good. Add to those looks great tasting fish and roll varieties and your making friends. This place is small and easily missed off of Rampart and Lake mead, but when you find it I recommend stopping in for a try. You may find me here again, stuffing my face with copious amount of Unagi covered rice.",

We've checked out a few different sushi spots - but this is most definitely moving into our regular rotation.   You've got to get the combo - it's the obvious choice. You choose either two specialty rolls or two basic rolls and receive a ginger salad, miso soup and edamame all for $13!! This is incredible! The sushi is great - they also have an all-you-can-eat option which is freaking fantastic...and get this - $1 sake every day of the week.   Not only is the food fantastic, but the service was superb!! I highly recommend Naka Sushi to any- and everyone!",

The guy immediately took our order and the sushi came out within the next 5 minutes! We did the AYCE that night and I LOVE the variety they have on their menu. From the simple sushi rolls, hand rolls, sashimi, baked rolls, desserts, and their special menu. Everything was delicious and I like how they make their portions smaller so you have room to try different things off their menu. Their AYCE dinner menu has a few more things than the lunch menu which makes up for the extra $3 during dinner. Definitely coming back! You can't beat quality AYCE for $23 for dinner and $20 for lunch!",

We only had to wait about 20 minutes and were able to get seated so that wasn't so bad.  But still....   After experiencing our dinner here... it's no surprise they didn't record our reservation.  Organization is NOT their strong suit.  Three different people took our drink order.... and it took 2 of them to bring them all out. Three different people kept asking to take our food order... where we'd place an order with one and the next one would step up to ask what we'd like to order... and then after a bit we would have to flag one of them down to remind them about our order.  The sushi was ok.  I wasn't impressed.  I like Naked Sushi and Sushi Wa better.  The one Good thing was that they don't over sauce their rolls... so that is a plus in my book.    But they do serve A LOT of rice with their sushi and rolls so that the fish which is normal size portions looks small.  Since this is on the other side of town from me, I'll stick to the sushi places on my side of town that I know and like better.",

    "text": "First off I want to give Naka san kudos for doing the work by himself , unless it's crazy busy which it always is. This is due to the size of the restaurant. it is quite small and cramped but does tie a nice cozy environment. I have known Naka san since he worked at various places in town. I am writing not as a acquaintance but as a real review of the food. For the prices that are charged. The food is decent and comes out fairly fast! Naka san knows his clients and can prepare things while they waiting for their main dishes or their larger sushi orders. The Japanese food on the menu is good. Now having said this, I have some issues with the customer service: At times there is no one to greet the customers and people are standing in line to wait for some acknowledgment. If you are NOT a regular there you would not know to seat yourself. Water and tea take a slightly longer time to get to your table. Getting the attention of your server may also take some time and depending on who that is he/she sometimes forgets things such as a tea refill, water, or even an order. This is not on a regular basis but consistent enough to take note. I eat at Naka's at least 3 to 4 times a month and each time there is one issue from the above either at our table or at another diners. To be fair I do not think the servers are given adequate direction in busing and hosting. This is something that will have to be addressed in order to retain and bring in more clients. The food again is nothing unusual or outstanding...it is good.....it ranks better than some sushi places in town but if you want super quality and service go to Osaka in Henderson or Katsuya in SLV. If you just want a family style meal that is good. This is the place to eat. I eat here out of loyalty to Naka san and his family. I can overlook the inconsistent service but some may not...your choice.",

The quality of the fish is pretty good too. Customer service is not as good as SushiMon in the southeast but special deal and value for the buck is good! Decoration is not good. Kinda cheesy Mexican style. Orange wall and well decoration and position. Nothing neutral color and arrangement like other Japanese sushi places. I bet it's a Mexican interior decorator that did it!

The nigiri sushi was very heavy on the rice and light on the fish.We stayed away from the rolls and stuck with the nigiri sushi. The owner/chef, noticing us going for the more \"costly\" alternative, decided to load the sushi with an overwhelming amount of rice. It was an obviously underhanded way to get us to order less and get us full faster. Do not be fooled by the posted photograph. We've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and this by far is the worst. Do yourselves a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",

We decided to wait for another table to open up, though I guess we could have sat at the sushi counter too.  Noticed others coming in for take out to avoid this problem.   I got a beef sukiyaki dinner and my husband got the tempura/teriyaki combo.  My sukiyaki hit the spot.  I thought the broth was tasty and it had a good portion of beef in it too.  My husband said there was a a lot of food in his combo and thought everything was delicious.  We were both stuffed and had no room for dessert.  My dinner came with soup, salad, and rice as did my husband's so it was a very good value.      Noticed a review complaining about the service but we had no problem. The staff brought our food promptly,  asked if everything was okay and seemed friendly enough to me.  We noticed there were a lot of families with children who came to the restaurant and the staff seemed very accommodating.",

My roommate and I ventured here to check out their AYCE sushi, which was the least expensive around. During and after dinning, it was apparent why their price was slightly lower. The food quality did not match competitions in the area and their selection was also quite limited when compared to others. I can normally set large amounts of food at higher quality sushi restaurants, however, I only ate 2-3 rolls (which were merely rice, fish, and avocado, no better options) along with a few orders of nigiri. After that, my stomach became upset and quite bloated. I also noted immediately that the rice was VERY warm compared to other sushi bars. Whole the rice is normally cool or room temperature, the heat of the rice was very off-putting and altered the taste of the already lowER quality fish. I won't be returning here and will gladly pay $3-5 more for an AYCE option down the road for a better variety, higher quality, and improved overall experience.",

First of all they are the only place we have been to for ayce that would charge more than a dollar or two for a two year old for sushi. Most are free since they don't really eat more than a few things. They were going to charge 9.95 but after only eating a couple things and the roll taking an hour to make they didn't charge. The rolls do not taste good. We first ordered nigiri. The tuna and salmon were cut very irregularly and uneven. The rice was loosely rolled and did not hold together. This was the highlight of the meal. We next tried some of their rolls. Once again the rolls were loosely rolled and all of the rice fell off before being picked up. The rolls were overly sauced. I was unable to distinguish a mango sauce from the eel sauce (except the color of the sauce). All of the rolls we tried seemed to be overly sweet or super spicy. Their yum yum sauce seemed to be nothing more than mayonnaise. Also we had to send a couple pieces back because the fish had discoloration and we didn't want to eat it. We finally opted to leave before having dessert because we felt it was not worth it at all.",

I was the first customer at Sushi in Summerland and a weekly visitor for 7 years, till the original owner sold the location and left for Henderson. After he left, the location took a fast and steady decline. I have spent the last 5 years in sushi limbo, trying one place after another. Then I found Naka Sushi! Not only is the original owner of Sushi in Summerland in the kitchen, the namesake Naka is behind the counter serving up the best quality and variety of AYCE I have had in years. The restaurant is well staffed and Naka is crazy fast with a happy go lucky attitude that is a breath of fresh air. You have to appreciate a Chef that is willing to say no when ordering an item because he does not feel it is up to par. When was the last time that happened in an AYCE Sushi Restaurant? My biggest thrill was enjoying some of their kitchen specialties I enjoyed years ago, but have been unable to find equal; Spicy Baby Octopus, Dynamite, Green Mussels, HOT Shrimp Heads, Etc. With the talent running this Restaurant, I would expect to spend the next 7 years back in AYCE Sushi Heaven! FYI. I joined Yelp just to post this review, so you know this comes from the heart!",

    "text": "When the sushi monster hits, all you can eat sushi seems to be the only thought in our minds. Lucky for us, we live close to a huge selection of AYCE sushi restaurants. In order to narrow it down, I phoned around checking AYCE prices and Naka was the only one that had a great affordable dinner price - $21.95. The other places were asking about $24 and up.   This place is a legit Japanese owned and run establishment (The chefs, all of the waitresses, and a lot of locals at the bar were Japanese). This place is a local gem and I'm so glad we came here. Great price for AYCE sushi, a nice big selection, the fish was super fresh and tasty, the fish to rice ratio wasn't too bad, and the service was great!   Let's talk about what we ordered:  Sashimi plate (1 per person) - the sashimi was fresh and sweet. We got salmon, yellow tail, and tuna. 5/5  Salmon - my first love, they are sweet and buttery 5/5  White tuna - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5  Albacore - great firm texture and sweetness 5/5  Halibut - very fresh and sweet and melts in your mouth 5/5  Yellow tail - super sweet, buttery and fresh 5/5  Unagi - not bad, just not my favorite 4/5  Ama ebi - (1 per person) we loved that they offer sweet shrimp in the all you can eat meal, yet, it was ok, the sweet shrimp was small and a little different than what we're used to - maybe it wasn't as fresh? We loved the fried heads though. It was fried to perfection! 3/5  Uni - (1 per person) my boyfriend loved it, he said it was very sweet, very fresh, and very good uni. 5/5  Tamago - I loved it! It was homemade and tasted like it was made with love. 5/5  Miso soup x 3 - the miso soup here is so good. They came out at the perfect hot temperature. Nice bits of tofu and seaweed. Great miso flavor but not too salty. This is how a miso soup should taste! 5/5  2 different rolls (Mark and Kara) - the rolls weren't bad, simple and filling. I probably would just stick to nigiri next time. 3/5  Baked mussels (2) - very simple and not impressive, I would skip it next time. 2/5  Fried tempura jalapenos - they were hot and crispy - not spicy at all - but we enjoyed them. 5/5  Beef wrapped asparagus - these were in a teriyaki sauce, the beef was super tender and flavorful. I loved these! I could eat 5 more plates. 5/5  Strawberry Mochi - (1 sliced in half) typical boxed mochi ice cream, but it was yummy and a great palate cleanser! 5/5  Green tea ice cream - nice green tea flavor and we both loved how it wasn't too sweet. 5/5  This is a perfect option for the budget conscious AYCE connoisseur, but I have become obsessed with Sakana lately so you might catch me over there AYCE'ing it up.",

But there wasn't anything special about this place. (That's right yelpers, I'm disappointed with ya'll!!!)  First, it is located on the big lots/terrible herbst complex at lake mead. We went on a Sunday night, 8pm. And it's dead over there. It is kinda sketchy and I'd be scared to go there by myself. Don't get me wrong, I love mom and pop, hole in the wall type places, but this didn't hit the spot.  Second, the food. No, no, and no. I mean I'd eat anything. But if you're a fatty/self proclaimed foodie, and you're expecting really awesome sushi, this is not the place to go.  The nigiri, fish and rice ratio was bad. Too much chubby weird shaped rice with super thinly sliced fish. Then I got excited that they have sashimi as part of their ayce. But the fish wasn't fresh, was brown on the edge, and one had a piece of bone on the super thinly sliced salmon. The rolls were blah, and looked really sloppy. Good thing they have half rolls, so you won't have to eat a full roll of disappointment.  Anyway, I guess they do deserve one star.... For the service was prompt and decent.  Thank you Naka, but I won't be coming back.",

Some forces were trying to stop me (a nose that won't stop bleeding) but this place is highly rated so I wanted to give it a try. But I was rather disappointed. The rice seemed like it's been sitting there for a while. Although the fish was fresh, it was a bit thinly sliced.  We did AYCE for $19/person and we tried tuna and salmon nigiri, Naka Roll, Tracy II, LA Boxing, salmon skin handroll, agedashi tofu, calamari tempura, chicken tempura and shrimp tempura. For dessert, we got banana tempura and plum wine ice cream.  LA Boxing Roll: Tuna, shrimp, avocado with salmon and lemon on top and ponzu sauce on the side.   Naka Roll: Soft-shell crab, crunch topped with smelt egg.  Tracy II Roll: Salmon, jalapeno, avocado with salmon and lemon on top. You might want to remove some of the jalapenos in this roll.   Salmon Skin Handroll: The salmon skin was not crispy like it should be.  Calamari Tempura, Chicken Tempura, Shrimp Tempura: Nothing to write home about.  I'm not sure I'll come back here. So, they have sashimi, soft-shell crab, uni, poke salad as part of their dinner AYCE for $22/person - I'll probably just go somewhere else for that especially if the experience I've had with the rice wasn't all that great. I didn't see anything special/ unique about this place for it to have 4.5 stars.",

    "text": "AYCE Sushi for about $21? Really, you can't beat that. The prices here are some of the lowest in town for AYCE. Naturally, that enticed me to want to give Naka Sushi a try.  The restaurant can be considered a hole in the wall spot. Its location is one of the last places I'd ever guess a sushi restaurant existed. Its desolate strip mall location it shares with a Big Lots and Chase threw me off. Naka's a small restaurant that seems to fill up fast, especially during the weekends. I was surprised we were able to find a seat at 7pm on a Friday.  Though we ordered plenty of food, most of what we ordered was forgettable, unfortunately.   Poke: The only thing that stood out was how watery this was.  Dynamite: 90% imitation crab. The scallops were tough and dry.  Brian's Roll: A unique sweet and savory combination. The basis was a California roll -- if memory serves me right -- wrapped in soy paper with slices of banana tucked inside. To me, I need to have an acquired taste for this.  Spicy Christmas Roll: I can't exactly recall its official title, but it's listed beneath the fried rolls section. This one was probably my favorite roll that I ordered. It's one of the heavier fried rolls on the menu, so I wouldn't advise ordering it towards the end of your meal like I did.   Mike's Roll: Another roll I'd suggest ordering if you want to try a deep fried roll, and it's much lighter than the Chiristmas roll. Plus, it wasn't bathing in sauces. It's a decent one to start your meal off.   If you're a visual person and are accustomed to neatly prepared rolls, you might be disappointed with the presentation of the sushi. Some of the rolls we received had a sloppy appearance that didn't entice my appetite.   Service was fine, but we didn't have one server. Instead, we had four different servers attending to our table. At times, it did cause some confusion.   Naka's AYCE was unimpressive. I guess for $21 we got what we paid for. I would've gladly spent several more bucks on higher quality food.",

We had good service and decent sushi for all you can eat. But unfortunately this time not so great. So I can only give it 3 stars.   They werent as attentive this time with the service. It started out ok but then they kinda forgot about us. At one point we ordered several different rolls and it took so long that 1 of the servers asked if we had ordered anything. Then they also forgot to bring a couple things we ordered. Also never asked if my sister or I wanted another beer. I finished mine well before we left.   Now here is where the worst part is, and Im kinda upset that we didnt say anything. My niece 1st discovered a hair on 1 of the sushi rolls but just took it off and threw it on the ground but I had a piece and actually had a strand of hair stuck in my throat! So didnt eat much after that.",

Water and food were brought out right away, and the waitress was super nice. Whatever we needed, she brought it right out for us. Chef Naka (also owner of the establishment) is suuuper nice! You can find him behind the sushi bar and always with a smile on his face.   Food: Food was pretty yummy. The nigiri had wasabi in it which I absolutely LOVE. You know you're at a Japanese-run sushi restaurant when there's wasabi in the nigiri! Mmm, mmm good. Nigiri fish slices were just alright. They were good and fresh, but I wish the size was a bit bigger. The nori/seaweed for the rolls were a bit rubbery though, but other than that all of the rolls that we tried were very delish! It wasn't overwhelmed with too much sauce. Though I wish it was packed a little bit tighter and the seaweed would be less rubbery, haha.  Price: Price is VERY cheap compared to all of the AYCE restaurants I've been to. Food isn't bad at all if you were to compare to the price. Fish is FRESH! One thing I don't like is that it's $9 for children under 8. I wish they made it where kids under 3 are free because my 3 year old doesn't eat much at all.  Other than that, this place is great! I would definitely come here again!",

Rice portion to nigiri seemed to have increased as the cuts got thinner, sushi took longer to serve, and we had to constantly remind our waitress about the orders that were missing. Not only that, but our ice cream and mochi took more than 20 min, with two follow ups. When we finally got our ice cream, however, I got a crunchy surprise to my mango ice cream. Crunch? In ice cream? When I checked, oh I got a glittery surprise, chipped nail polish. Wow.",

Homemade ginger dressing on house salad. Mixed tempura was fantastic. Tuna tataki was amazing. There was also a really spicy roll on the board that was awesome but don't remember the name.

We usually go to Sushi Kaya but we didn't feel like waiting an hour to be seated so we settled on trying something new. We had high hopes to the 4 star sushi spot... Were still scratching our heads on how this score came to be.  Naka Sushi is located on Lake Mead and Rampart in a Smiths shopping center. We walked in and were immediately seated. We both opted for the AYCE for $22.00 and were greeted by a not so cheerful server. Never caught her name but she was absent for the most part. The bus boy was constantly taking our orders and filling our drinks.   We ordered a few specialty rolls and sashimi. Out of about 20 items we ordered we only liked 2. The Brian Roll and Mark Roll were both fantastic. But they didnt make up for the rest. Hafl of the sashimi we were afraid to eat because of the strong \"fishy\" smell and taste.   Overall we probably wont be back, We will stick to authentic sushi spots.",

Just to put this in perspective, once Naka and Aki moved from Sushi Factory, it was hard for me to eat at any other sushi place because the quality and service just couldn't match Naka and Aki's  The best things my family usually orders are: (1) Saba (Mackerel) (I'm known as Mr. Saba there cause most people don't order it but I order a TON of it) (2) Naka special hand roll (rice, spicy tune, crab, etc.) (3) Udon noodle Soup (amazing broth and huge noodles! my daughter literlly DRINKS the broth) (4) Sheryl roll (a more dessert like hot roll with cream cheese and crab) (5) Super white tuna (6) cajun albacore (7) nitro roll (a spicy roll) (8) Tamago (cold sweet egg tastes like dessert... this is homemade and the BEST)  this place is about $5 cheaper than most other AYCE restaurants. If you go there, thell them \"Mr. Saba\" sent you! :)",

But, as soon as we ordered the food kept coming, we really didn't wait long. Perhaps, because we only eat nigiri not the Americanized stuff (creamy cheesy rolls, some call sushi). Shrimp tempura was sweet, I've never had sweet hot delish shrimp tempura. Sushi and service was great!! Will def be back!!",

It's a small location in the corner of a strip mall but totally worth you checking out. Turns out it is run by the same guy who used to run Sushi Factory on S. Eastern which I used to go to regularly.   The rolls are solid and the sashimi as well. I really wish this place wasn't so far from my house but alas, when I am in the area, I will definitely make it a point to stop by.",

I have been coming here since a few months after they opened and have always been greeted warmly and served promply. When I lived closer, I would come about 3 times a month but now its about once a month. The prices they have are the best of what i've seen. This is definitely my favorite sushi spot. The only thing i have experienced that is a bit of a let-down is that the two lady waitresses that were hired within the last 6 months are a hit or miss when it comes to service. You could get someone who is happy and prompt in taking your order or someone who looks a bit unhappy to be there. I enjoy the naka roll, spider roll, nirto hand roll, L.A boxing roll, and the mochi is yummy too- but then again, everything i have tried has been :)",

    "text": "About a month ago, I was up in the area and decided to give Naka Sushi a try because I had been to my normal sushi joint, Yummy Sushi, three times in the past two weeks and I thought I'd change it up. I wish I had stuck to what I had known.  I'll make this absolutely clear...Naka Sushi is NOT bad.   The service is fantastic, the people who work there are very friendly and the rolls actually come at a pretty quick rate when you order them.   Their downfall is simply how un-rememberable and bland the sushi and food is. It's not bad food by any means...it's just there.   With All You Can Eat for $21, you can certainly fill up your stomach, but it won't have much of a unique flavor to it. I would almost suggest this place to someone who has never had sushi before, because it would be a good safe place to start and every place that you would try afterwards would have more flavor.  Naka Sushi is just not for me.",

There service was pretty good though. Last time, we had to wave in service, this time, the sushi chefs were attentive and on top of it. Everything was good, though nothing stood out. If you live nearby, this is a good place to get full on yummy sushi. But there isn't anything standout here either. As I was looking around, I saw ice crystals on some of the fish, no telling if it had been frozen, or if it had just been over-refrigerator. But there wasn't any cold burns on anything, so it's probably a case of over refrigeration. One thing I did like, is that many places charge a little extra to have Toro sushi with AYCE, Naka doesn't.",

I'm giving this place a 5 star now because I thought that both their food and service had improved, at least compared to the lunch service we've had previously.  The sushi is still not at Yama or Goyemon level but is getting close.  Ayce dinner is at $21.95 and is an awesome value considering they serve sashimi, even though you're limited to one order per person (6 pieces).  They also have many more staff for dinner so the service was really fast.  We couldn't eat our food fast enough and they're already delivering our next order.  I'm happy to have come across this sushi bar and I'm looking forward to eating many more of their sushi.",

Not a fan of this creation, just a tomato base hot sauce roll with no other flavor. And then, you have the Tokyo Blaze roll.

    "text": "After being spoiled in LA by my absolute favorite sushi joint, Oki Doki..... I've had to keep my eye open when I moved back to Vegas on where to eat good sushi here.  I had tried around 5 places or so from 2008-2009, and all were fairly good, but I hadn't found a \"spot\". I shop at Smith's, Big Lots, and Savers often, so when I saw Naka Sushi with the grand opening sign with All You Can Eat.... I figured why not?  Beforehand, I tried Yummy Grill and Sushi once, and it wasn't bad, but again... I wasn't blown away either.  So I can say now, after more than a year of eating here; I come atleast once, sometimes twice a month. I've felt more than welcome each and every time. They know me by name. I've brought numerous friends in (even some that have had my favorite place mentioned above, Oki Doki)..... and we all agree. We absolutely love it.  I see numerous sushi places everywhere, and believe me. I want to try them all. But it's hard to want to when I feel so at home in Naka.  Maria Roll, Santa Maria Roll, Spicy Baby Octopus, Salmon Skin Handroll, Teriyaki Chicken and Cheese Roll, Octopus nigiri, Surf Clam nigiri...... those are my \"must haves\", and then I usually pick out 2-5 other new things to try every time I go. I've probably had about 85% of the menu and there's maybe less than a handful of things I wouldn't have again and that's mostly due to my personal tastes, not because it was terrible.  I'll get around to trying some other sushi places eventually. But my permanent Go-To spot is definitely Naka.  For the price: you get quality service, always familiar faces, a very large amount of choices for \"all you can eat\", diverse musical selection along with the perfect home-feeling ambiance, there's always sports on if you're into that, food that rarely (if ever) disappoints...... it's all good.",

We've visited for lunch on 2 occasions and tried various choices including veggie tempura, tonkatsu, chicken katsu, sashimi, and California and spicy tuna rolls. While the katsu items are decent and generously sized, they are a bit on the oily and soggy side. The tempura batter is too thick and more like a beer batter than actual tempura. The sashimi and rolls were disappointing. The freshness and quality of the fish was mediocre. The lunch combos also come with a decent miso soup and salad.  Service was a bit slow and our server seemed a bit confused and disengaged. Both times, it was not that busy, but it took awhile to get drink refills and our check.  The food rates about 2-2.5 stars, but we'll round up to 3 stars because of the inexpensive value. Will we return? Probably not. We'd rather spend a bit more for better quality.",

There were different appetizers to try out (as usual with AYCE) we tried their steak wrapped over asparagus rolls and yuuum the steak was really good.   We were able to order 1/2 rolls so we got to try more. We tried the Toyota roll which is a baked roll and it was delish! It's similar to a japanese lasagna. I wasn't able take pictures of sushi because by the time it hit the table it's gone.   This place is cozy and the AYCE is 21.95 definitely a good place to check out in the Summerlin area.   I asked about the peanut butter mochi and its not on the menu nor do they have it in stock :(   The whole BOGO discrepancy was that they asked someone from the LVRJ to post a deal on BOGO asahi beer but the journalist posted BOGO on asahi beef -- (is what we were explained) I believe it, I honestly don't think a restaurant would try to scam people that bad in desperation to come in, especially if they're food is good quality.",

Well, I was getting too much sushi in my diet and I want to change it up as I'm working on getting into shape. To help me with that, Naka assists me by putting very little rice in my two combo roll dinner.I've had occasions here where there was a small supply of fish in my rolls and it made me forlorn. Then, the next day the rolls were exceptional with chunks of yellowtail and salmon to support the Alaska roll. REALLY TREAT YOURSELF TO THE MARIA ROLL. It is really terrific. Maria is the wait staff that you want on your side. There is more to her than meets the eye and she is quick to rectify any order confusion. 2 regular rolls with miso soup and salad/edamame for under $10 is hard to beat.

Most sushi Lunch AYCE places we go to offer the poke salad, which I think one of the main item that should be in the menu whether it's a lunch or dinner AYCE.",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite sushi joint in Vegas. Their prices are a little cheaper than the competition. I absolutely love their rolls! The 007, Muscle Buster, and Maria rolls are my favorites. I also love that they have dessert options other than a teeny little mochi ball. They actually have tempura ice cream as part of the all you can eat price. It's one of the few places that doesn't skimp out on giving the cheapest and smallest dessert they can.   The staff is good as well. I have never had any issues with them. The head chef is very funny and friendly. He seems to absolutely love what he does and his great attitude shines through!  The only key points to keep in mind is that the location isn't the prettiest. It's next to a Saver's and is pretty small so dinner time is busy. However, you won't wait more than 5-10 minutes for a table. It's a more hole in the wall place so probably wouldn't fit your needs if you're looking for a fancy place to take an important client to, lol. In my opinion, I love that they focus more on their food quality over making it a hip place. Although they did recently remodel. It's very clean just not a fancy shmancy place.   It's always my go-to sushi spot!",

The best of the bunch, though was probably the Jony Jony -- a spicy tuna roll wrapped with different cuts of fish. The green tea tempura ice cream wasn't bad too.

I had to ask the chef if we're suppose to sit ourselves. And I guess.. Yes you are suppose to sit yourselves if no one acknowledges you  \\_()_/    Not a busy day. Our waters came out 10 minutes from sitting down, which is a pretty long time for just waters. And than a waiter came by and asked if anyone has taken our orders, uhhh no you haven't taken our orders!   Let me tell you, this is by far the worse presentation of sushi I have ever seen. The sushi you buy at the grocery store has a better presentation. The fish is falling off the sushi, the sushi is falling apart, the seaweed is not properly sticking. What a mess! It was just a visual disaster. As seen on my pictures.  The rice looked like it had been sitting out too long. You can tell by the picture I posted, it was pretty hard.   I do not even know what sushi roll came out because when they were brought out they didn't even tell us which roll was which. So that is why in my pictures I do not have the name of the roll.   Even the edamame tasted old. Looked like they just sprinkled salt on top of the frozen ones you buy at albertsons.   The workers looked like they were tired and having a bad day.   I will not returning... Ever. Sushi craving was NOT satisfied! What a waste of a sushi day.",

I don't go for sushi though, I like their meal sets and other non-sushi Japanese fare. For the price, you can't beat what you get. Only thing that deters me sometime is that its kind of dark in there. That's just personal preference as I like well-lit places where I can observe the outside world.",

    "text": "I have Naka sushi on my bookmark forever. I have been on sushi craving all week. I guess having Yummy sushi opened up my appetite on sushi even more. Therefore, I decided to come and check out this place since it's closed by work.   We got there around 6:15 on a Friday night and it was pretty empty but by the time we left, it was a full house. The restaurant is not that big. They have around 10 tables or so.   For the appetizer, we tried karage, salmon skin salad, fresh oysters( today's special), and vegetable croquettes( today's special). Only vegetable croquettes was notable. However, I don't really taste the veggie besides potato.  I'm a nigiri lover so I usually start my sushi orders there. We tried the following nigiris: salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, spicy tuna, scallop, sweet shrimp, sea urchin, wasabi tobiko, tamago negi toro and eel. Scallop nigiri was on their special of the day and it was pretty fresh. Salmon was decent and buttery. Uni was not bad for ayce. Tamago was looking a little dark but it tasted decent. Negi toro was pretty good. Spicy tuna and red snapper was fishy and mushy. Not a fan of wasabi tobiko either. It was bit fishy as well and it wasn't covered up by the wasabi. The only roll we tried was eel and avocado roll since we were too full. It was not bad. We all had tempura green tea ice cream for dessert . It was yummy.   Service was decent and attentive. I was amazed that that have 3 or 4 waitress for that small restaurant. With their cheaper ayce price for dinner ($21.95), it's not a bad place to come if you are hungry and in the area.I give this place 3.5 star.",

The only restaurant in the city that prepares sushi comparable to Naka's is Soho Sushi, which is the highest rated sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. Chef Nakamura is the best sushi chef in town and prepares a massive diversity of delectable, authentic plates that will make sushi your favorite food. All you can eat is a must. TED Roll, Whitefish Tempura Roll, and Chicken Teriyaki Rolls are great. All nori is fantastic as well at Naka, as the fish is always as fresh as possible.",

I've been to other restaurants where the anwser to our \"special requests\" are no.  One example switching salmon for tuna.  Really!!! Salmon is cheaper.

    "text": "3 Stars, the place was busy on a saturday afternoon, but I don't see it much better if it was tuesday at opening either. The food is simple, the presentation is zero. It's not bad sushi and it's not great either. Yes, the server was not smiling, but I don't care if he does or not. If you want to see a smiling clown, go to the circus. He was prompt in seating us, we waited just a few minutes, took our drink order and then on with the sushi in the All you can eat mode. The first order of various rolls were good and as I said before it's just little round plastic like plates and no presentation points, not too overly sauced and was ok. We didn't get the small soy sauce dishes, but just put the sauce in the larger plate that had the wasabi and ginger on it. The sign on the wall said \"Fresh Wasabi\" $1, but the wasabi that came with the sushi was fresh as can be and had the punch to the nose zip! We started out with one server and then another one started to serve us, which was kind of odd, but it worked. The two guys are busy and if they hired just a single table busser they could take care of business much better. It's not a good thing when suddenly a plate drops down like a stone from heaven and you don't know what the item is, they are too busy to tell you. We actually had one roll fall on our table that we didn't know it was for someone else until we ate it. I'm like, \"We didn't order this\", but it was good so thanks to whoever didn't get it. LOL! I also order a few nigiri sushi (the small bites) and it took a while for it to arrive, I could see it was ready up at the sushi bar, but it sat for a few minutes. Then when it came the rice was noticeably warm which meant they didn't make enough during prep time because it should be cool to compliment the fish.  The restaurant is tiny inside, but somehow they manage to seat everyone the best they can. Random signs on the walls with specials such as $1 sake and different beers. I had a Sapporo light and it was good, I guess they don't offer the giant godzilla size bottle like most places, but that is ok by me. I am in Summerlin and have a long drive back to Henderson so, no buzz is a good thing. My second drink was Asahi Zero which is a low carb and no alcohol \"beer\", it was cold and good with enough bubbles to satisfy like a coke, but with no sugar overload. The also offer a Mango soda in a bottle and it was good too. The restaurant is located in or near Summerlin, but I will have to admit there was some skectchy looking people in that parking lot, but that is no fault of the restaurant. Probably just a product of their environment with a thrift store on one side and big lots on the other? Just saying. Decent sushi option if you are in the Summerlin area, Rampart and Lake Mead. Lunch is $19.95 and dinner is a few bux more. Mushay mushay! LOL.",

Not too fancy but very hole in the wall.  Everything ordered was delicious! My favorite was their Mochi selection and their smap roll.   Everything came out in a fast manner and their dinner only items were awesome!!!! They even have tataki and quail egg!!! Their beef tataki sucks though and tastes like lunchables meat so don't get it haha.  The service was kinda slow because we had to ask for more water three times, in an empty restaurant! Overall, I will be back for their delicious food and high quality sushi items :)",

    "text": "We wanted to try a different place that we have not been before, so we decided to have AYCE at Naka-sushi since the Chef, Naka used to work at Sushi-mon which is our go-to sushi restaurant in Las Vegas.   First of all, we noticed the place had a fishy smell as we entered. The waitress noticed us right away and welcomed us with a smile in cheerful tone of voice so that was a good impression. The interior was like a very old looking restaurant - Back to the 80's. The background music was also totally random which ranged from old Japanese music, to Jazz, to the Beatles sound tracks. Not good or bad at this point, just little classic feeling.  We had counter seats and the chef Naka served us. Even though there were only 3 groups including us at that time, he kept forgetting our orders. The fish in show case looked dry and some white fish had a slight browning to the color, which shows that they are not fresh at all.   I saw some small blocks of tuna that were sitting out of plate in the show case, and when we ordered Poke Salad, he used THE blocks that were not on plates and served it with way too much sauce. The salad bowl was almost half full with sauce. We didn't want to finish the salad because of where the tuna came from and the overly strong sauce taste.  They have a huge choice on Rolls instead of Nigiri and most of Nigiri is limited to 1 order per person. Fresh oyster looked fresh but there was a fishy smell that savored in my mouth. Grilled Shrimp comes in a skewer with 3 TINY shrimps with LOTS of sweet sauce on top. An order of Sweet Shrimp and the Scallop come with 2 pieces of Sushi, but the Shrimp/Scallop a single piece was cut into 2 pieces to fulfill the orders.  On top of that, there was only 3 choices on dessert which were coconut mochi, cookies&cream mochi, or rainbow sorbet. They were also on the 1-order-per-person list. Very stingy.  Side dishes were lined up with diverse of Tempura and fried food etc. Our shrimp tempura was crispy and Agedashi-Tofu was good! They had Salmon-kama which the size was reasonable though the fishy smell was still there.  The waitress/waiter was a good impression at our check-in, but they weren't as attentive as we thought. Our counter was immediately full of empty plates and none of them cleaned them up until they stop looking around and stand at \"their position\" to look over other tables.  As I mentioned. the freshness of fish and how they take care of them were questionable. We were hesitant to keep ordering more food. We finished our meal with a small cookies&cream mochi ice cream cut in half and left the place behind....  I guess we sacrifice some things for saving a few bucks.  We will never come back there even if somebody is paying for us. That's for sure.",

My husband ordered the 19.95 all you can eat for lunch, and really loved the Joni Joni roll. I wasn't too hungry, but for 13.95 I got soup, salad, and two special rolls of my choosing...which was a darn good deal in my mind!  The presentation wasn't all there, but the extremely fresh fish and veggies make up for all of that. The owner was making our rolls and you can tell he loves what he does and puts his heart into it. The rolls were perfectly made that day (can't speak for other days) and the service was really quick and the server we had was pretty patient while we absorbed the menu and all the offerings.  We will definitely be coming back to Naka Sushi",

    "text": "After coming here for the past 5 years,,, I think I had 75 check ins here,,,,no more.  It all started going south a few months ago when my scallop sushi order was drenched in lemon, not usually the case.  Much to my demise, the lemon was masking a really bad tasting piece of scallop, which in turn led to me being sick.  So, we stopped going for a few weeks, then started to go again, cautiously, progressing to almost weekly like we had before, noticing a slight decline in quality of fish.  Shortly after our return to patronage, we noticed that we were kind of being treated like we were less than favorable customers.  The main chef behind the sushi bar for which the place is named, Naka, wasn't interested in engaging in conversation like he had in the past, and was a bit stand-off-ish.  I will preface this last part by saying we would always call to make reservations to sit at the bar, and upon arriving, would be seated at a spot on the bar that was always labeled reserved and would have our names on a piece of paper with the reserved sign.  So we make our reservation, arrive to be shown to the bar where my name and phone number are on the piece of paper in the middle of the bar, great,,,, until Naka starts talking to the waitress who was seating us, in Japanese, to which she responds with hesitation and a look of confusion, then turns to us and says we can't sit here, but we could sit at the end of the bar next to the kitchen, and a dirty dish cart, and the bathrooms, to which I already know what it's like to sit in that cramped stinking area.  I say to her that my name is on that reservation here in the middle, which she relays to Naka in Japanese, and through her reluctant translation, she tells us that Naka wants that spot for someone else, which embarrassed the waitress to have to tell us that.  I refused the other seats that Naka wanted us to sit at, he never looked me in the eye to offer any explanation himself, which speaks volumes of him and the quality of his fish.  So, we told the waitress just to forget we came in, and we left.  10 minutes after we left, Nakas wife calls my phone as I'm driving, which I assume could only be to apologize for him, leaving a voicemail to call her back, but I'm not interested.  The food quality has slipped, his service has declined, and then we were treated like unwanted guests.  Just as well, I'll take my money elsewhere, as we've since found better AYCE, and will not be returning here.  We will miss the wait staff and Jose, but that's where it ends.",

It has definitely gone down hill unfortunately. The dining areas are full of tons of home made signage that look cheap and dingy, there were tons of menus given to us that were dirty (how many menus do you need for each person? I got three total).  The fish quality has gone down and the fish portions were disappointing. A tiny dab of spicy tuna on top of a tiger roll with so much sticky rice you'll gag. The staff looks well over worked and irritated in general. I probably won't come back even if I'm in the area anymore. Sad, because it used to be really great.",

Sushimi was probably the worst quality I've ever had. House salad, the ginger dressing was WAY too watery in the consistency. The unagi, they made into a \"rice roll\" even though its not even supposed to be in the form of a roll? Just overall, the quality was horrible. Definitely learned my lesson for going somewhere out of convenience rather than going somewhere I know is good. I hate to write a bad review, but I would rather try to help the business to improve by sharing my experience. Sorry Naka Sushi, but there's a lot of areas to improve and you should with rising competition in the area for sushi.

Baby octopus was not chewy at all, AYCE is affordable and has tons of options, this time around I ordered the lunch special for $14: soup, salad, and any two special rolls. The Aki roll is my favorite, cannot go there without ordering that roll. Mr.Naka is also very friendly and personable, smiles each time we walk in the door, says goodbye and thank you when we leave. I honestly do not have a single complaint about this place.",

My family has been coming here since 2012 and usually go at least twice a month. I cheat on my diet just to go there. Anyways, my favorite rolls are LA boxing, salmon skin hand rolls, and Tracy 2. Service is amazing! I love the owners, they're so sweet. One time I wanted sushi and they were closed so I was forced to go elsewhere and I was so upset because it was not even on the same level of Naka.",

I'm a fan of their teriyaki dishes. If I feel like I need to order something on the healthier side, I would get the teriyaki chicken with brown rice. Today, I ordered the bento for more taste options. Their chicken katsu potion was a little small but since i had a lot of other dishes on my plate, I understood. Super crunchy though! Shrimp tempura was cooked to perfection. The Alaskan Roll wasn't all that impressive but I didn't expect it to be being that it was in the \"regular roll\" section and not one of their \"special rolls\".  As for the service, the waitresses were moving as quickly as they could but the sushi chef did yell at them multiple times to move faster. Not sure what was up with that but I thought it was kinda rude of him. Overall always satisfied with their food and service. Will always be back.  Also, I wish this place was a little bigger. I feel like every time we come, there's never any seats for a party of 6. We always have to wait.",

    "text": "I am currently on the hunt for a great place to enjoy AYCE sushi with family and friends, since YamaSushi is way too far a distance from my home right now, and I decided to give this place a try because they had a good average of reviews.  The fish they have is definitely fresh, which was great, and a big bonus was the variety they had to offer (ex. special rolls). Price is also good, and is the cheapest that I've found thus far. The presentation of the site and food is alright. The service they had was not totally commendable. I have to say that my boyfriend and his brother are not the easiest to get along with, but if you can put up with them, you're great, and my boyfriend likes to thank you with a really big tip. I, on the other hand, am nice to you so long as you're good to me, which still ends up getting you a decent tip. With all that said... The waitress/server we initially had was alright to begin with, but her service started lagging because of the amount my companions kept bugging her about food information. I realize this isn't fine dining, but you could at least have the basic knowledge about the dishes you serve and inform us all. We had also modified a few orders, and the kitchen hadn't followed, so we sent it back, expecting to get it all corrected. Didn't happen - became ghost orders. The most irritating factor about this particular server was that she started ignoring us. We tried flagging her down to simply order more, and she constantly breezed by our table.  The savior of the night was a young man who was supposed to be her helping hand. He created small chat with us, entertaining my boyfriend's 6 year old nephew, and tended to us when she ignored us. We gave him a 25% tip, and we gave her the coin change from the bill. I actually gave him the tip personally, and left her looking after us dumbfounded.  Tip is based off the service you give, and is not required, and that is exactly what we practiced.",

The fish is reasonably fresh and portions are good for nigiri but the amount of rice is too large, disproportionate to the fish and too glutinous with the grains lacking separation. For sushi, the rice quality is paramount, something that is lost in many sushi places in the US. Sloppy presentation and a lack of refinement. Number of choices for nigiri is also limited compared to other places. Won't be back and better to pay more at another sushi joint.",

Our server made a couple suggestions that allowed us to get the items we wanted for the most efficient price.  The restaurant offers all you can eat options, dinner specials and individual options.  We had the japanese lasagna roll, baked green mussels, california roll, scallop roll with yum sauce, and a salmon/jalapeno/avacado roll.  The ingredients were fresh and well made.  The rolls were tight, but the hot sushi didn't keep its integrity.  I don't think it is fair to expect hot sushi rolls to stay super tight.  The appetizer miso soup and salad were good as well.  The pricing was quite fair for all dishes.  I would recommend people go here for great sushi and the great service.  I'm not sure where all the negative reviews come from.  I get that there are people who know more about sushi than me.  That being said, I cannot see calling this one of the most horrible sushi places in Las Vegas.  That just seems a little ridiculous.",

Most of the nigiri and rolls are on point, but some AYCE places tend to make rolls reallyyyy big and messy with rice going everywhere, and it happens here on some of the rolls.  But you know what, for $20 bucks, not sure I can really complain here.  But I recommend the tiger roll, simple and delectable, my goodness!  They do a good one here  Favorites are (as I mentioned earlier) the tiger roll and the paradise roll.  Those are a must and their house salad is one of the best I've ever had.  Homemade ginger dressing, can't go wrong with that.  So glad there is an AYCE in Summerlin!",

I usually stick to sushi when I get AYCE but some of the rolls looked too good to pass up.  The Nacho Roll (sounds like tons of sauce, but it's not) was by far my favorite.  Lots if Salmon and Avocado inside and jalapeno and some spicy (not mayo) on the outside.  It was amazing.  The owner was working behind the sushi bar (as he does 7 days a week) and he was awesome.  Great service, great price, great atmosphere, and excellent fish.  I am a happy customer and will return very soon.  Thank you Naka!!!",

I would highly recommand you to choose here than another sushi's places. Its too far from my house but I would rather drive 10 miles just for some good dinners. Btw prices were so cheap! 23.95$ ?!

The service was very good and attentive. Kept my drink full and kept my plate of ginger full.... They saw my plates empty and asked if I wanted anything else efficiently. They talked to me and had nice discussion.  I really liked the fireball and the nitro hand roll... There are a few more I want to try so ill have to go back as I was too full. The rolls were good with really good combinations. They even said next time I can get different combos or make my own. And I can order half rolls! They gave me a side of eel sauce too! That is a good ayce place... The only reason lost a star is they told me the above important info about making my own and half rolls after I was done! That would have changed what I ate as would have been able to try more. Their spicy tuna wasn't too spicy either and I like it with a kick! I have a lot of sushi places to try but based on service, location and variety of rolls I would go back here....",

Our server did not rush us and was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of despite her other tables. She had a really nice attitude even after the numerous questions we had. We came about an hour before close and she made sure to let us know that we had a couple minutes left if we wanted to order anymore.

Everyone was super friendly, sushi is delicious and fresh, and the mango ice cream was the perfect dessert.   I can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner.  Favorites:   * They have SASHIMI!  One order per person, and it's tuna, yellowtail, and salmon, but it was fantastic! *Mango Ice Cream *TED roll - it was so big it was difficult to eat, but the flavors were incredible *They do half rolls, even at the tables!  So much nicer to try a big variety of food *Can't beat the price, $21.95 for AYCE dinner?  Awesome.  A little meh: *They used a LOT of wasabi on the nigiri to hold the fish to the rice.  It was actually a bit overwhelming (and scary at first, since it made the yellowtail look like it had a green spot on it)  Come to think of it, that (above) is my only complaint on the evening.  I'm a huge fan, will definitely be back, so glad to have found a great AYCE sushi close by!",

I've been to plenty of all you can eat sushi restaurants and never have I seen such a skimp! And of course you can't leave rice behind so I'm still craving  sushi and filling up on rice. That'd have to be my only bother. The spicy baby octopus was really good too, never seen that served.   oh and that tempura batter is delicious! Reminded me of a funnel cake. Needless to say I devoured my deep fried specialty roll. I will be back but I'm curious if you get better sushi when you order a regular dinner vs all you can eat ?",

I don't think this was one of my favorite ayce places. It was hard to get the server's attention. They put a lot of rice in the nigiri. I'm more of a fan of the places that atleast have a balance or lean towards less rice.   I'll probably visit somewhere different next time.",

The menu is surprisingly vegetarian-friendly, with several standard and special veggie-only rolls!  But I came for real sushi. The nigiri was okay, everything seemed fresh enough. The list of rolls is extensive, and I appreciate that you can order half rolls if you want. The dishes and rolls were ordered were fine but nothing especially stood out- I typically avoid rolls with cream cheese but I would especially do so here, as they're heavy-handed with it.  The sushi chef who was helping us was nice and laid back, to the point that he forgot a couple of our rolls. I really liked the atmosphere here but I think they need to step up the sushi a bit.",

Get inside the Sushi is pretty good also the inside looks better than the outside! Seating may be a little tight at times because the food and the servers are above average. The next time we visit it will be on a weekday before the evening rush. AYCE price is lower for 8yr old and younger which may be a good option for some parents. Overall this visit was above average and we will return. Glad this Sushi restaurant is in Summerlin...",

Came back tonight with my son and it was still fantastic. Naka the owner seems to take special pride in the quality of the food and insuring his customers have a great experience.

The price is super cheap for AYCE, and they have lots of great specials for those not interested in AYCE. Oh, and they have dollar Sake. Not my thing, but worth mentioning.  The owner and his wife are super sweet and attentive. If Naka sees you looking around for someone he will come immediately himself if he thinks you'll have to wait.  The fish is not the absolute best in town, but it's fresh and tasty. The rolls are all pretty standard. If you're getting dinner pretty much everything is available for AYCE.

We all got different orders and shared amongst us, so we all got to try many rolls. We also got some appetizers. Shrimp tempura was good but nothing else was. The rolls were not very good. Some rolls were better than others but for the most part they were not good.  We decided to come here because of all the great reviews but it just didn't cut it for any of us.

Only reason I give 4 stars is because sometimes when they bring it to me it's not cooked through all the way aka they don't cook it long enough so make sure the shumai is hot and cooked through. Also their sushi rice falls apart a lot for some reason, perhaps they don't use enough rice vinegar idk I'm no sushi expert but the sushi/fish itself is excellent and always fresh. They have many options as well as ALL YOU CAN EAT. I love their California hand rolls, and their nigiri sushi. Their staff is always friendly. It's a small cozy vibe restaurant. I wish they were open later than 10:30pm :) also idk at what time it happens but they close after lunch for a bit before reopening for dinner again at 430/5pm. So make sure you call before you arrive to avoid getting there and find the restaurant is closed. Overall I love this place and I go frequently.",

The owner, Naka, has one heck of a laugh and is very enjoyable.  The music and ambiance here can range from romantic to casual.  The music makes me laugh and smile.  My favorite go to rolls lately have been the SSS Roll, LA Boxing, Brian Roll, and Christmas Roll.  Other items on the AYCE menu include: Miso Soup, Poke Salad and Tempura Vanilla Ice Cream!  I never wince at the check when it comes because I feel that I've gotten mounds of value without sacrificing quality.  And without fail, every time we leave, we hear the friendly words: \"See you tomorrow!\"   Sorry, maybe not tomorrow, but very soon!  Highly recommended.    Just do it.  Your stomach will love you for it!",

It's PACKED on Friday nights but I've never felt like the service was busy. Our food comes out in a timely manner.   The only all you can eat where they serve a sashimi order - 2 yellowtail, 2 tuna, 2 salmon.  Honestly, I think that makes it worth it.   If you're on the west side, I think this is as good as it gets.",

    "text": "$1 hot sake? Yes, please!  This is a new AYCE sushi joint that has popped up in Summerlin, and I am definitely a fan.  I usually avoid AYCE and order my favorite nigiri and sashimi items instead, but since my in-laws were visiting (and they looooove AYCE), I joined in on the gluttonous feast.  And at $21.95, how could I say no.  I started with the \"1 order per person\" section: uni, raw oysters, sweet shrimp, and the sashimi trio.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  So far, so good!  I also added 2 orders of agedashi tofu and a spicy tuna hand roll.  Topped it off with green tea ice cream and I was quite the happy camper.   The rest of my family definitely took advantage of the AYCE, and ordered rolls, dynamite, salads, tempura, and sushi galore.  And they enjoyed every single bite.  Everything was delicious and the service was fabulous and very welcoming.  The owner, Mr. Nakamura, was even the one behind the sushi bar masterfully creating these tasty masterpieces.  And we learned that the chef in the kitchen serving up the warm dishes is also Japanese.     I'm so glad that I took a chance on this new restaurant because now I know where to go when I need to satisfy that sushi craving.  And with Lent in full swing, you can bet that we will be regulars!",

This review is more based on the atmosphere, the sake and the approving grunts from my friends as they inhale their food at lightning speed.  First of all, let's all say this together - '$1 SAKE!\".  That's worth 4 stars alone.  The service is also great and the servers are super friendly.  The prices are crazy good - $8 for a huge bento box with teriyaki chicken, tempura veggies, rice, several crab rolls... it's massive.  Plus, the sushi is priced great too - a la carte & all you can eat.  You can place orders ahead of time & pick them up.  The bathrooms are clean (always a good thing) and it's super cozy inside.  I may not eat the food but I love hanging out there with my friends!  One last note - my husband is a total sushi snob and loves theirs!",

The salmon, tuna, and yellowtail just fell apart when you ate it, and the portions were very generous. Our server was amazing and attentive and answered any and all questions we had. The nacho roll is easily my favorite so far! I highly suggest this place.",

So talk about hungry and one of my friends suggested Naka Sushi since we were riding in the area and raving about how cheap the AYCE lunch is here. I like \"WHAT\" AYCE for lunch under twenty bucks. NO WAY. I love sushi and firm believer AYCE the only way too go with sushi. It got me worried thinking since its so cheap maybe something not quite right. I was really happy with all the sushi I ordered and the other ones I tried that friends ordered (we all did AYCE).. They have average size menu with lots of the normal things find at any other AYCE spots. I felt the fish was good not the best that I had in Vegas. Freshness. Still for the price nothing too complain about besides the fact they were bringing out our orders pretty fast. Service was great! We asked for four separate checks not problem at all. Never had my soda cup empty the whole time. The sushi chef even though not sit at the sushi bar love the positive, happy, and excited about life vibe from them. Those guys constantly smiling on the way in and leaving. The decor was nice nothing out of the ordinary. I did find it interesting they were playing lot of Hawaiian local music from the 808. Anything reminds me of home and the 808 worth extra star all on its own.   Naka Sushi great bang for your FISH!!!! It not on my side of town but if in the area and want too get cheap sushi on Naka the way too go. Just don't come in expecting too be blown away with the freshness or wow factor comes too the fish. Still something too be said about good food at great price...",

As I was searching on Yelp for All you can eat sushi, this place popped up and since I never tried this spot out I said \"Why Not.\" My bf and I hasn't had sushi in a while and since we were craving for it for months it seemed like a perfect time to go.  Naka Sushi was not a disappointment. It sure served us justice! The staff was on point with drinks and ordering sides. The sushi chef was very friendly as well. I looked at the menu and noticed that AYCE was $21.95 for dinner and $19.95 for lunch. Now that is not bad at all!   The sushi was delicious and they had a lot of rolls to choose from. My favorite was the SSS roll...it was amazing! We also ordered some yellow tail, octopus, surf clam, and Cajun albacore. All delicious and not overloaded with rice. They also had $1 hot sake, I'm not a sake fan but that is not a bad price at all!",

I had the Toro sashimi and while good, I think their Hamachi is better. The shrimp tempura was perfectly cooked, crispy and light. Their Teriyaki Hamachi was over cooked, but the taste was great, almost like miso butter fish. One thing I didn't like at all was the miso soup, it tasted like it was instant and watered down. For a place that is \"japanese\" that was a very poor miso, it should be addressed. Service was excellent and friendly, and would like to go back and try the other items.",

Don't get me wrong, their sushi is always on point, but there are so many other things that are amazing. Their lunch and dinner combos are tasty, filling and incredibly inexpensive. Chicken katsu curry is one such dish. It's best on a cold day; it will warm your bones.   Chef Naka is always adding new items so it's impossible to get bored with the menu. I highly recommend the baked muscles, toro sashimi, dynamite, tempura anything, tonkatsu, gyudon, sea urchin, tomago, Naka roll, atama (deep fried shrimp heads, if you've never had them you're in for a surprise!), chicken fried rice (Japanese style fried rice is much different than Chinese fried rice) and cold noodles with seafood. Even subtle nuances, like their potato salad and their salad dressing, will surprise you.   On the non-food related side of thing, Naka and his wife (along with the rest of the staff) are some of the nicest people you'll meet. In addition to speaking English, many of them speak Japanese, Tagalog and Spanish; so if your need to brush up on your second languages, this is a good place to practice! The music is always interesting. I've heard songs in English, Japanese, Thai, Hawaiian, Spanish and Klingon (I think.)  Plan your eating strategy before you order. Many times I've gone in thinking, \"I just want a simple dinner, no need to order all you can eat,\" and ended up spending over $100 (on myself, without any alcohol!) All you can eat sushi is not limited to nigiri, rolls and sashimi. Almost anything on the menu is covered in AYCE. Try that at most AYCE places!   So yeah, I recommend this place. Highly!",

They have wonderful service and staff, and are pretty quick about getting your orders out shortly after placing them. They have a wide selection of specialty rolls and drinks. AND of course who could forget about dessert? Most sushi places I've been to only have 3 flavors of mochi, while this place I think had 5+? So of course I just HAD to try the cookies and cream mochi. Safe to say it was good and was promptly devoured.",

I wanted to like it so much. But I had to admit I would not want to come here again. It was the taste of the fish something is off. It's not like blatantly old. Something is just off. Idk. It's ever so slightly, but enough for me to not want to come back. Very strange.  Is it the lemon juice that they tend to put over the fish? Because that is one brilliant way to ruin the taste good fish. Or perhaps it is slightly old. Or both.   I would be willing to pay 5. Dollars more for their ayce if the quality was a bit better, and I would be a friend customer. I'm really bummed because I wanted to like this place so much. They have all the options!",

    "text": "Context: visited Vegas with family and coming from California's \"AYCE Sushi\", this beats it by a landslide. In Cali, the AYCE Sushi quality of fish is not good and cold, everything comes in slabs and there's really no selection. Every menu is the same as every other place. So here was so refreshing to have good quality fish, and a HUGE selection of items. And of course, only $21! Um, what?!   Sushi: They have a huge selection of rolls and categorize the menu whether you want baked items, fried rolls, spicy rolls, raw fish rolls. There's so much to choose from! My dad, who can only eat baked and cooked food, had a huge selection from the cooked rolls.   - Baked Salmon Roll: Soft and delicious! They fill it with baked salmon inside! Very flavorful. - Salmon roll: Raw salmon inside and very fresh fish. They have a choice of putting different stuff inside your roll like asparagus or cucumbers, etc. - Rainbow roll: This roll was super good! It was our first roll that came out and you could tell immediately the fish here is fresh and not stale and hard. It's a mix of all types of raw fish like albacore, salmon, tuna, etc. - Cajun albacore sushi: Pretty good, a nice seared style and more spicy flavor - Ikura (Salmon Egg): You have to already like Ikura to like it anywhere really. I'm not a huge fan, it's really salty but it's not really their fault, just felt like ordering it to try again. - Salmon sushi: I love Salmon so this was super tasty and fresh - Surf clam sushi: Not my favorite, but then again you've had to already like surf clam  - Salmon skin salad: Yummy and delicious! A nice small portion so it's a small taste of it - Miso Soup  They have a list of items, and you can choose only 1 item per person since they're specialty items! I absolutely loved this idea because at AYCE in Cali they don't even have this option! They have items like Uni Sushi, 6 pieces of sashimi, sweet shrimp, etc. Such a great deal.  - Soft shell tempura: Great item! Comes with a ponzu like sauce, so good! - Fresh oysters: These were pretty good! Not the best compared to expensive freshwater ones but I'm happy since it's on the menu. - Kama fish (Grilled Yellowtail): This was DELICIOUS. I'm surprised they even had this on the menu because at sushi restaurants it's about $12-$15 by itself! A must order  Dessert: They have a wide selection of dessert including Green tempura ice cream, banana tempura with ice cream, and a list of normal ice cream selection. I got the GT ice cream and it was tasty and amazing!   Drinks: We tried this new mango soda and it was so good! (Additional charge) Very refreshing  Environment: I really liked this environment, it's a small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend a huge party. They have a bar and normal seating which I like.   Service: Their service is a little bit slow because they had 2 huge parties, but we were sitting in front of the sushi chef so that was helpful because they took our order there. But everyone's really friendly and nice!   So yes, I loved this place because of their wide selection, their choice of dessert, and overall was great.",

    "text": "First all, I swear that I've eaten at this Sushi Restaurant at least 3 times before.  Those visits were not so good and I wasn't impressed  However, I have changed my opinion just off my last couple of visits.    My visits here have always been lunch and it's usually their AYCE.  AYCE Lunch is $18.95 and Dinner is $21.95. Price is about average for Las Vegas.  What I like about Naka is that you can get half rolls, which means more sampling for me.    My Ratings: -Teriyaki Chicken w/Brown Rice:  Pretty good.  I admit that it taste better with white rice. But I feel better about myself if I get the brown rice.  -Calamari:  Literally 4-5 pieces.  Taste good, but don't expect a dish full of fried squid.   -Mr O Roll:  This is basically a lobster roll and very tasty.  The roll isn't tight like other places and I use to be a snob about this.  But it all goes down the same and its the taste that counts.  Besides, a loose roll to me is basically a mini hand roll.   -Arizona Roll:  When it comes to sushi, I am bit boring. Regardless where I eat sushi, I usually get a Spicy Tuna, something with tempura shrimp inside, and an Philly Roll.  The AZ Roll is basically all three in one.  Good combination and the best of both worlds.   -Tuna Nigiri:  They requested that I try it. Pretty good.  -Yellow-tail Nigiri:  My 2nd favorite.  Small, but fresh.  Besides it's all you can eat so order more.   -Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream:  I have yet to find someone that makes a really good deep fried ice cream or tempura ice cream.  Best I've had was in a Chinese Restaurant in Rome Italy.  Not flying out there for tempura ice cream so this will have to do.  Still good, but wish the ice cream was softer  Service is great from the bar.  Like most sushi restaurants, you are not neglected if you are sitting at the bar.  I did notice that guest in the normal dining area had to wait a little longer for their waiter to get them their food while I got mine with the quickness.   My only issue, which is not a big deal since I only go here for lunch, is the size of this restaurant. It's small and I can't imagine what a busy night must feel like.",

After trying 4 or 5 of the local spots near us we were tired with the unimpressive quality and cuts of fish along with below average service. FINALLY!! We came across Naka Sushi in the heart of Summerlin! We were very impressed with the friendly service and the amazing quality and a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls. It was a huge bonus that the owner and chef is Japanese. To me that was important because of the friendly nature of the Japanese culture and the expertise factor in sushi preparation and quality of fish selection.The food here reminds us of so many good times throughout Japan.  Great Price for the all you can eat! Awesome to-go lunch meals for great prices  Delicious Oysters, Tempura, Yakitori just to name a few of my favorites at Naka's  And to top it off a nice sized flask/tokkuri of WARM SAKE FOR $1.00 EACH!!!  I'm hooked and happy!",

We arrived to Naka for the dinner service that starts at 4:30, and we were greeted by the waitress and sat at a booth. Told her my selections and they arrived quickly. The appetizers are ok, the ahi poki, and mussels weren't to my standards from my experiences at other establishments but the fish is very fresh, the service was timely and I never saw the bottom of my cup. They were always around. Very good sushi imo for the location. I will be going back again.",

The Mr. O and Mr. I roll are not overly tasty for the price.  I had one last week that I wasn't thrilled with, but I will try all the rolls on the menu just because I am that person.  The sushi chef is use to seeing my boyfriend and I now as he said last time I was leaving \"see you tomorrow\" HA. a comedian and sushi chef.

They offer $5.95 lunch specials, where customers can order two entree items (e.g. teriyaki, tempura, California Roll) and also get miso soup, rice, and a side salad:  that's a deal!  I decided to double up on the tempura shrimp and vegetables, so I ended up with 4 tempura shrimp and a lot of veggies.  I realize that it's a LOT of fried food, but sometimes you just have to give in to the boss (my stomach).  My boss also wanted strawberry mochi, so I got that, too.  All in all, with my iced tea, the meal cost me a whopping $9.67 (without tip).  Friendly, fast service, and cheap food near me means that I'll be back when the boss wants some Japanese in a jiffy!",

Their rolls are absolutely delicious and full of flavor. Most of them are unique to Naka and Mr. Naka himself takes great pride in his work, as he should!!   My favorite sushi rolls have to be the Spicy Christmas roll and the Nitro Hand Roll, they are a must try, especially if you're like me and you enjoy a little bit of spice in your sushi.  I will recommend this place over and over again because for the price, the quality is above and beyond. Not only that, but such a great staff and quick service!",

For dinner, I ordered the teriyaki salmon, California roll, shrimp, & vegetables tempura, combo with soup, brown rice, and salad. Unfortunately, the service was a tad slow considering it was a Saturday and the staff seems new and scarce. $1 hot sake was just right and soothing. The portions were large in which I requested a box for the leftovers. Hopefully, in terms of physical space, this restaurant should expand to accommodate the large number of customers. In conclusion, I highly recommend Naka Sushi because it is affordable, delicious, and friendly.",

We waited for about 30 minutes until a lady with 4 of her kids came into the restaurant. 5 seats opened up at the bar and she decided to tell the other waitress (not the waitress I checked in with) that she would like to sit at the bar. The other waitress proceeded to just sit the family without looking at the waiting list. I was so mad at this point, for waiting 30 minutes and for the waitress not being attentive in looking at your list or seeing that 2 patrons were waiting at the door. That's really just basic customer service aside from the mother with 4 kids being rude and a plain old bitch. The waitress (who I checked in with) was nice enough to come out of the restaurant after my partner and I had left the restaurant into our car. All I ask is to just be more conscious and see who is waiting to be seated and look at the waiting list. The restaurant is not that big, you could see the front door from the sushi bar.  We won't be visiting again.",

The environment itself is very comfortable and they have TVs with ESPN on them so one thing down for myself. The lunch price is very reasonable for AYCE sushi. I didn't stuff my face as full as I usually do, but I did try a few items such as the Tako, Surf Clam, a Tod roll?, muscles, and the white tuna. Everything was really good, the only real complaint I had was that the Tod roll seemed to break apart really easily. While it didn't beat out my favorite sushi joint, I'd be willing to come back to Naka anytime.",

The place was packed for lunch and I never had time to get hungry between rolls.    The spicy mayo was delicious and much thinner than it usually seems at other restaurants (which is a good thing as it might be less fattening).  They do not stuff all of the rolls on the all you can eat with crab mix or imitation crab like other restaurants do.  If there was something I would add it would be rolls with garlic ponzu like they serve at The Sushi across the street.  The fried banana dessert was awesome.  I will be back.",

We laughed with the staff and they told us how they came about opening and working for Naka Sushi. We made a reservation so they had a reserved table for us thank GOD the place was packed, make sure you male a reservation especially anytime after 6pm. The only down side was they were out of fresh oysters but who cares the place was so awesome we will defiantly be going back sooner than soon.. They were so kind to our baby girl, they even gave her some special cookies... The staff was so sweet I been saw the waiter Nick assist an elderly couple out of there booth... We loved Naka Sushi : ) the staff made the whole experience even better.   Price for all you can eat is so reasonable lunch is around $18 and dinner was $21 per person.  Thanks Jen",

We had ordered take out from here a couple of months ago and it was delicious so we returned for an AYCE sit-down dinner.  Our servers were so nice and accommodating; at one point, about halfway through the meal, they both noticed a large order of sashimi that had hardly been touched and asked if it was okay.  When I mentioned it was fine, just a little too much raw fish for the group, they offered to take it back to the kitchen and cook it all tempura-style for us.  They came back a few minutes later with the tempura fish piping hot and absolutely delicious.  It was gone in minutes!  The servers explained everything to us and brought us our food very quickly.  When they found out it was my daughter's birthday, they brought her a pretty fan at the end of the meal.  Upon entering and exiting the majority of the staff greets you and/or bids you farewell.  All the food we ate there was delicious, fresh, etc.  Can't think of much more to say...just go there and see for yourself how great it is!",

Not to mention there was only one server/waiter taking care of all the tables. Since I don't want to be a total downer I will say that the quality of fish wasn't bad.   There are many better ayce sushi places in Vegas, don't waste your time and money coming here!",

They have a good dinner menu with decently priced dinner options.  Their AYCE is $21.95 per person, which is a really good price. My only complaint is about one of the waitresses and her bad attitude. She is not afraid to tell you no and will not compensate for any thing you ask. If you talk to Naka directly he will. So I advise you to sit at the bar because you get better service. I recommend going their over any other sushi restaurant.",

The restaurant is 3 minutes from our home and the food is pretty good, but we feel so unwelcome by the owner.    Sure, I have three boys who love sushi. Sure, they each probably eat more food than the $22 cost of dinner.  But it's disturbing that the owner (and sushi chef) glares at my family when we walk in.  Haha.  I would prefer that they raise prices than cringe when big sushi eaters take advantage of their pricing structure.   We used to laugh about it amongst ourselves, but quite frankly, I can't support a business owner who doesn't appreciate their regular customers.    We went to Sasa Sushi on Cheyenne the other night and service was much better.",

Well, as soon as we arrived, they attempted to seat us and asked if we were doing the AYCE. We said yes, and asked about the prices. The waitress said it was $22/person, but it would be an additional $9.99 for our two year old to join us. (Which is the same price as an eight year old.)  WTH? You're gonna charge $9.99 for a two year old when kids this young are usually free? Toddlers hardly eat anything and mine sure as hell doesn't eat seafood. You've gotta be kidding me. The waitress just kept pointing to the menu and repeating, \"$9.99\" If that's how your restaurant makes your money, you're doing something wrong. PASS ON THIS SCAMMY PLACE!",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this place out! I mean, $19.95?! For ALL YOU CAN EAT?! It's the best deal  I've come across so far in the Valley. Naka is located in a \"feels like it's old or run down\" shopping center. When entering there's a light fishy smell, but you quickly get used to it. Your eyes take a moment to adjust because they keep the seating area dark.  To give some background, I am no rookie to the AYCE sushi game. I can hold it down, and have impressed many a person with my skills. I let the game down today. I can't be blamed though, and you'll understand.  My boyfriend and I sat ourselves in a booth and studied their menu. We came during lunch which had a good and steady crowd. After 10 min passed, we realized that they take longer than what we're used to make a roll. When we finally got our first rolls, it was to our dismay to see the amount of rice used. Don't get me wrong, I love rice, just not in the proportion that it was to the rest of the food in every roll. That tiny detail was what made us tap out after 3-4 rolls each.  The \"Muscle Blaster\" was a favorite of ours because we love gyoza. This roll had 5 pieces of a gyoza  in each. \"The Brian\" roll was so different. The banana was a refreshing taste for your palette. Once the banana is gone it gets kind of bland except for the little kick at the end from the jalapeno. Today the fish wasn't the freshest. The staff was attentive though. The choice in music was interesting. It was a mix different types. They do have a separate menu for regular dining, but I didn't take a look. For those of us familiar with the China town area here in Vegas, this place reminds me of Ichiza, but with more sushi options. It was disappointing, but it was for $20.",

    "text": "I was really disappointed with this place. The reviews sounded so promising. I placed a reservation for a party of 6 as a tentative headcount for 7:30 on a Friday evening. When a seventh person arrived, our server didn't even offer to pull over another chair and he had to squish himself at the edge of the booth. The meal was very uncomfortable because our server did not smile, AT ALL. He just hovered over us looking angry...not sure if it was a bad day or if he was upset that he got stuck with a big party doing AYCE. Sorry to tell you that if it was the latter, that is part of your job working at a sushi restaurant who offers AYCE and you should not take it out on your customers. There was another waitress who stepped in and took a few of our orders and she was nice, so it's not the whole staff.   Anyway. We each paid $22.95 for AYCE dinner, with an additional gratuity for the large size of our group. The fish quality here was questionable. No pride was apparent in the sushi quality or craftsmanship, which was odd because the nigiri in the Yelp photos looked fresh. Ahi and hamachi looked old and sad. The unagi was good, but that's about all. We ordered some rolls and they were forgettable. Dessert is limited to one item per person, and the green tea mochi ice cream was hard and flavorless.   I wanted to like Naka, as it has been on my bookmarked list of places to try for quite some time now. However, with the sub-par sushi quality  and spotty service, I won't be returning here; I would rather pay a little more for AYCE at Sushi Goyemon.",

I turned on my Yelp app and found a place that just recently opened with no reviews yet.  A new spot wants to impress so it has to be good right?  That's why we're here to find out while getting our fish diet on!  I came here but I was only really looking to order nothing but 20-25 orders of nigiri.  You really can't beat their $21 all you can eat dinner price, most places it ranges from $24-$26.  Lunch was $18 and that's what I had.  I sat at the bar because I wanted my sushi fix fast!  My first order was 3 tuna, 2 salmon, 1 white tuna, 1 fresh eel, (NO TORO), (Out of Uni).  The sushi chef was actually \"Naka\"mura, the owner!  How awesome was that??  His wife was working the front desk area.  Naka was sociable and enjoys what he does.  He gave me the tuna and salmon order first and waited until I was almost done to prepare the rest, I downed those quickly.  If I order a bunch, it's because I can eat it in one setting.    I hate waiting or watching my sushi orders wait on the counter.  And I'll sometimes secretly wish that it's someone elses order that is sitting just waiting there.  While I was eating though, he was persistent on me trying some of their special rolls.  I wasn't interested but I did find out that they do half rolls.  Looking over the menu, none of the rolls really jumped out at me.  For the sake of an honest review I ordered 3 rolls, the first being a mountain roll, second is the naka roll, and finally a scallop roll.  They were all okay but nothing outstanding.  I need to find some sweeter rolls, deep fried rolls, or chefs recommended roll.    All nigiri comes with a dab of wasabi underneath.  Chef Naka was surprised that I didn't use soy sauce for any of my sushi roll or nigiri, and he was extra surprised that I applied extra wasabi on all my orders.    They have a facebook page where they'll ask if they can take your picture to promote their shop, I participated.  :D   Definitely give this sushi spot a try, it's not the best, it's not bad, it's good and convenient if you need your sushi fix in the area.  I tried their banana split dessert, I posted a pic on here and the banana is deep fried with ice cream and whip cream.  It was good but I wanted to try more than I needed.  Happy eating Sun City!",

Service:  even though I came in 45 minutes before closing, I was told I could not do the all-you-can-eat sushi dinner, which I think was unreasonable.  My server was not the most friendly, but the sushi chefs were nice.  Ambiance:  is clean and basic with a tv, tables, and sushi bar.  Value:  is not great given what you get.  Perhaps the all-you-can-eat is worth it, but I am not convinced of the quality of the fish.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to find a AYCe place a bit more close-ish to the house than some of our other side of town haunts and so far this seems like a good contender. Dinner was $21.95 and lunch was $19.95 which is a bit cheaper than average, but offers a lot on the menu.   Appetizers -  Softshell crab - standard, but good. Nice crisp batter.  Spicy baby octopus - this was meh, just some boiled chewy octi with some teriyaki sauce.  Tuna tataki - this was pretty good! Seared tuna, ponzu and some onions.  Sashimi side (2 pc of each fish) - Salmon was pretty fresh, the yellowtail was good, albacore was OK but still acceptable.  Jalapeno popper - theirs was really good. I like the thin sliced bite size pieces over whole ones.   Nigiri -  Cajun Albacore - was really on point! Ordered several rounds.  Super White - pretty  decent range of freshness,  Yellowtail - pretty good as well  Habanero masago - this was awesome and spicy  Uni - very fresh, sweet and creamy  Masago - good stuff with some quail egg.   I think the rice to fish ratio here is pretty good actually. They do put wasabi in their cuts, so if you are sensitive to it, then you might want to let them know. The sumeshi rice had good seasoning as well and right on consistency.  We also had a mike roll which I liked the crunch texture on, and a albacore roll which was also pretty good. The salmon skin handroll is one of my favorite things and there's was one of the best I've had.   Service here was great. It was a slower late weeknight, but the sushi chef was very nice and attentive. Things just came in succession so we got in a lot of dishes in a short amount of time. The server kept out drinks filled and plates cleared.   I don't think they do a stamp card, or at least none was offered to me. I'm pleased with the selection and quality for this first visit so I'll be back and see how consistent this place is.",

White tuna is a rare find, which they do have, but no Uni. Spicy baby octopus turned out to be squid heads, pretty tasty still. Menu had a variety of rolls and all the ones we ordered were good.

Naka and his staff are awesome and friendly, and I'd feel guilty if I went to another sushi shop since they are so nice.  They have a bunch of items that are \"1 per person\" but Naka always bends the rules and hands me plate after plate of these items.  I sit down and he hands me a plate of sashimi, and later in the meal I always end up with an order of sweet shrimp and toro.  I'm not sure how liberal he is with people he doesn't know, so it might pay to be a regular.  I was telling Naka how my favorite scotch is Japanese (Yamazaki), and he said he never tried it.  So I picked up a bottle from Total Wine and went in with some friends last night.  All the staff was drinking with us, as well as the $1 sake, and we had a blast.  We learned how to say more in Japanese as we were all yelling \"Moto Yamazaki!!!\"  Funnest experience in an AYCE sushi joint ever.  I'm heading out of town for a month and a half and I sure am going to miss this joint!    P.S. - If you go, ask to try their peanut butter mochi (WARNING: they may be out of it)",

    "text": "Great Sushi  This is one of my favorite sushi bars in Summerlin. Located on Rampart and West Lake Mead, Naka Sushi is in the small corner of the strip mall next to a Dance studio, OmG Boba and Savers.  The sushi here is always great, the service is also pretty prompt. The chefs are always friendly and personable. I recommend the Brian Roll, the Miso is good and the Nacho Roll are all bomb. Usually the custom hand rolls are also pretty Legit, one being the Nitro  Great AYCE lunch and dinner specials are great value. Remember they are open on split shifts and not right through the day.  They have high chairs and are very good with the little ones. The last time I was in there had to be at least 4 other tables with kids and were all catered to with either high chairs or custom rolls from them to eat.  Overall Drink: 3-5 Food: 4-5 Service: 4-5 Coming back: every chance I get",

This place can get very busy during lunch and dinner time as it is very small. They have a reserved area for regulars which I find very nice. VERY INEXPENSIVE which helps me waive the fact that sometimes the service isnt the best. I personally just try to converse with Naka as he is always in a great mood and makes sure my guests and I are taken care of.",

If the water is foul it stands to reason that everything cooked in the water is also foul which includes the rice, the udon, the green tea, the miso soup, etc. The tamago was gray. Nothing was yummy. Nothing. This place needs to invest in a good water filter. This was a total waste of money. The restaurant is also tiny and overcrowded. The only pleasant thing about this place was the couple sitting next to us (might as well have been sitting with us) were so nice and we had a pleasant conversation. Pay a few dollars more and go somewhere else.",

Sushi was good and its close to home so I can't complain. There was one male server there not sure what his name was but he is very rude and has no personality. I'm not sure if there's a language barrier there, but you have to repeat everything you order at least two or three times and he gives you this look like you're stupid. Other than that I will definitely be going back. Hopefully the next time we will get a different server or we will just sit at the sushi bar.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to try this place based on the mostly positive reviews.   Sadly, mine is not one of them.    My wife and I came for lunch and was seated pretty quickly.   We ordered our usual quantity of nigiri and appetizers for the first round.    Appetizers were ok.  The dynamite was below average.  Nigiri sushi had way too much rice and the slices of fish were not top quality and were inconsistent.   We noticed that when we picked up the nigiri sushi to eat, the rice fell apart, making it difficult to dip into the soy sauce.  We had ordered 8 orders of salmon nigiri on the first round but 8 orders of red snapper came out instead, which my wife tried and commented that it looked and tasted like talapia.  The waitress commented that she had thought we wanted snapper, not salmon.   Do they sound alike?  Anyway, after the initial order, we ordered maybe a few more appetizers and a couple more nigiri.  Not much better.  The karaage chicken tasted microwaved and was not crisp.  We lost all appetite and opted to just finish what we had and leave.  Usually when I leave a ayce sushi bar for lunch, I don't even want to think of dinner.  Today I left hungry.  We keep comparing other sushi places to Doh Sushi on Spring Mountain and have not found anyplace that has the same quality, service and menu as they have. Of all the ayce sushi places we have tried, Naka Sushi is definitely on the bottom of the list.",

Naka Sushi isn't bad, their AYCE is $21 which is as good as it gets in Vegas, but they also have restrictions on how many times you can order a certain thing, not unheard of, but if I'm paying $21 and want two orders of oysters, I should be able to have it.  They are seemingly accomodating with any \"special requests\" and their fish is fresh, which is worth a million.    My husband ordered the bento box dinners and it was a pretty generous portion -- the food is pretty good, although the yakisoba did not go over well with my kids.  Also disappointing is there is no AYCE for kids.  Fuji-San used to have a kids rate of $9.99 which was a lot more reasonable for the one roll and one mochi ice cream they typically eat! :)   Anyway, stop in . . . . it's not the best ever, but it will likely make your belly smile!",

They offer half rolls which is nice. The chef also made me a special roll that wasn't on the menu without any trouble. I will most definitely be back!",

    "text": "As a Vegas local, I try to avoid the strip & it's over-the-top restaurants with expensive menus. When comparing the local sushi restaurants on the west side of town and their AYCE quality/prices, Naka is by far the best. It's $21 for AYCE dinner, which most other places charge at least $25+, and the quality is amazing!! It's some of the best sushi I've ever had and the atmosphere is so nice. It's kind of like every server is your server, so whenever anyone sees that your table is empty or your glass needs refilling they will come over. It's pretty efficient despite sounding confusing. And it's ALWAYS packed! In my opinion, if you have to wait for a table at a sushi restaurant where there are tons of local regulars and a packed bar, you know that this place is worth giving a shot. There are a lot of items on the menu that I haven't tried, I generally stick to the individual sushi and a few rolls. But I have always had a good experience and plan on coming back often.",

    "text": "Today is my second time here with my girlfriend and bestfriend. so far we walked in and were not greeted. Our server today doesn't seem happy, seems more irritated to serve us because we are young or something. As she was taking our order she was rushing us as we took our time to order because there is alot of good sushi on the menu. Giving is our drink we said \"thank you\" to be polite, but we didn't get a \"your welcome\". We got our food in a good amount of time. it's been 5 min since we been done with our food and the waitress still has come by to ask if we still want anything else! WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS! Customer service isn't this place strong point honestly, their food is great though so definitely worth it.  I would recommend people to come here if they don't mind the little things I pointed out. I'm just speaking the truth.  Lunch all you can eat $18.95 a person and dinner $21.95 a person. by far cheaper than most ayce sushi place I've been to.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant during a recent trip to Vegas. It's in a strip mall in Summerlin about 10 minutes outside of Vegas strip. We came here because of the positive Yelp reviews and also because they took reservation for our big party, and the price of $21.95 for ayce was very reasonable. Seven people in our party went for the ayce option and two grandmas went for fixed meals. For the ayce crowd, we ordered a variety of cut rolls, including the 911, rainbow, and several others. We also ordered a variety of nigiri sushi, including uni which was on the 'only one serving per person' list (also on the list was soft shell crab, which was quite delicious). Overall I would rate the restaurant just 3 stars mostly due to the quality of the fish, which was just okay and not 4 or 5 star quality. The service was good and we had no complaints. I would try this place again rather than a generic Vegas buffet.",

I've never done the AYCE because I am generally full on a couple of rolls, and these do not disappoint!  Plus I have a couple of times shown up and ordered to-go on the spot, and I've waited only like 15 min for a delicious meal to take home and get some work done with.  I really enjoy their dinner specials!  Edamame, soup, salad, and two rolls for between $10-15 (depending on the rolls)?! Yes, please!!  The sushi is so fresh and delicious, and the mochi is also yummy.  And when you eat rolls incorrectly, they don't laugh at you, but instead kindly come correct you :D Soon after discovering Naka, we ate it three times in one week.  Stop by, and if you live in Summerlin, make this your go-to sushi place!",
