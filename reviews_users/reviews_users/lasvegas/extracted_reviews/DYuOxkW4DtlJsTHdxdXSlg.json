The wings were all a good size and it's served with a nice flavored sour cream that perfectly complements the flavor of the wings and balanced the spice of the Habanero.  My server Devin was also very friendly and attentive.  I had a great experience.",

The first was mid-week with a party of 10.  There was a special lunch menu that offered perfect portions.  Everyone loved the salads and I love the beef empanadas.  The food was very tasty and was served fresh and hot items were hot.  The service couldn't have been better.   We went again on Sunday and got the same great service by Alexis H. and the food was again very good.  We appreciate that the service and food here are so consistently wonderful.",

I'd never heard of this place before I moved to Vegas, but my friend recommended it one night years ago for dinner. I had my reservations once I realized it was owned by the Darden Group, since I'm not a huge fan of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, but I held back on my complaints.  I've tried several dishes here over the years and some are hit or miss. The portabello mushroom sandwich lacked flavor and texture and it wasn't as hearty as I was hoping for. I tried a pasta dish on my last visit which I actually quite enjoyed, however.  Overall, what I really like about the restaurant is that it's a great place for groups. There are lots of spaces to socialize and and private places. I've even seen weddings and receptions held in the private area. They also have a great little happy hour.",

We ordered the jerk chicken, coconut shrimp, seafood paella and warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake for dessert. The coconut shrimp was \"yummilicious\" (Maggie C I'm stealing your  adjective). Just the right amount of crunchy batter on the outside and plump and juicy shrimp inside. The jerk chicken was ok, I was expecting a little more heat, but then again that's just me and my taste buds. The seafood paella was the bomb. Not as good as my grandma's but close enough so that really says a lot. Of course I had to leave room for dessert. Warm chocolate pineapple upside down cake. Need I say more? It's got three of my most favorite food in the world: chocolate, pineapple and caramel syrup. Yes warm and uber moist chocolate cake topped with juicy, tangy pineapple slice on a bed of gloriously rich and gooey caramel syrup. Love it! Can't wait to go back for more.",

My dad had the lobster linguine which I tasted and it sadly enough did not taste of that much.  Ended the meal with a dulce de leche cheese cake which was soooo delicious and so sinful to eat as it contains about 900cal according to the menu card.   I also had a margarita with my dulce de leche cake, which I will not recommend unless you really like tequila as it is really dominating in the drink.

The habanero chicken wings weren't that spicy, but you get at least a dozen wings. The lobster and shrimp quesadilla was a bit lackluster. Otherwise, great happy hour find!",

We went at lunch time for the first time at any location hoping to get a variation on the menu. We were pleasantly surprised. We got the lobster quesadilla combo with a caesar salad. The caesar had slightly too much dressing incorporated into the salad, but the amount of lobster and shrimp packed into the quesadillas made up for that minor hiccup. Great food and atmosphere as usual. Special thanks to the host staff at the front who were very hospitable!",

I mean I'm 5'3\" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1  When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2  I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.  Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.  What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13. whoohoo  When we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4.",

There are a few appetizers with shrimp, but all are prepared differently. There are a variety of appetizers to choose from, including shrimp, chicken, and beef dishes.  There is live music as well at night, adding to the comfy island feel. This is a good place for a date night or even families, being open for lunch and dinner.",

We started off with the coconut shrimp, which was delicious (the dipping sauce is really good). We also had the chicken wings and they were flavorful and finger licking good:-)  The mojitos are by far the best mojitos that I have EVER had and I've had lots and lots of mojitos!!! They had just enough sugar and mint and they had a pretty good kick to them, not to mention they were only $4.00 (during HH). Did I mention they had a pretty good kick:-) They were so good, we went back the next day, just for the mojitos (and not during HH - they were $7.00 each).   For our main entrees, we ordered buttermilk fried chicken breast..OMG this dish is delish!!!!It's a layered dish of mashed potatoes, chicken breast, topped with spinach onions and cheese, and then layered again with another chicken breast and potatoes. On the side, the dish also included corn and black beans drenched in a wonderful sauce.  It sounds like alot and it is, don't worry about that, get a to go box if you have to. This dish is awesome and a must to try. I would order it again in a heartbeat.   The atmosphere is nice (tropical theme) and the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating.   Great job Bahama Breeze!",

I asked the server if he can tell me why, and he had no answer for me.  I switched to their coronarita, same thing.  Food was pretty good, can't complain there.  Also, that party room on the west side is always hot.  So here it is, if you want to pay $12 a drink to be in nicely decorated room that reminds you of the islands, then go for it. If not, then go elsewhere.",

They were very accommodating and everyone single person in out party loved their food, including the kids! After trying our appetizers we began to share food, because everything was seriously soooooooo good. For an appetizer, order the Jamaican jerk wings, they are the best wings and cooked perfectly. They have a happy hour after 9 with half off appetizers and special drinks, so well worth it. Fresh lemonades made with real fruit and shaken for you. Really delicious! Kids pasta is great and serving size is big. Salads are huge also. Really, nothing bad to say about this place, food came fast, great live music and friendly staff. Also had the empanadas, coconut shrimp, fire cracker shrimp (my personal favorite), ribs, jerk chicken pasta, shrimp and grits, steak and crab stacks. I'm sure there was more but bottom line everything was good. You will not be disappointed!",

Lunch special was good (Mahi mahi).  I suggest adding the $2.5 side salad,  a great value.  Margarita was a little on the sour side (many near the strip have been to me) not too weak though : ).

The drinks were the best part of our experience. Both were awesome and reasonably priced.   We had the fish taco's and a cheeseburger. The fish taco's tasted like a sewer, but my cheeseburger was ok. The quality of ground meat wasn't really of my liking, but the avocado was great.   This place is huge and it felt like we were secluded in our own little corner--too lonely.  I definately would have preferred to sit closer to the center of the restaurant.  I don't think they clean that part of the building because we saw a lot of dust falling from somewhere right above our food. The table light illuminated the particles as we covered our drinks and plates with our hands. Ummm yeah. A few more drinks and we probably wouldn't have noticed. Unfortunately we weren't that saucy.    WIth so many good restaurants in the area, I don't think we will be back.",

The vibe and music playing all a taste of Caribbean and reggae tunes.

I got the happy hour experience which was enjoyful. Not only was my bill very inexpensive, my server was pleasant as well. There's free wifi, and lots to choose from on their menu. I ordered a couple appetizers and enjoyed the water. Some pros and cons are listed below.  Pros: wifi, appealing decor, kind service, not too loud, quick seating time, lots of table space, clean  Cons: Waited for straws, food quality was decent, food presentation decent, small quantities  Overall: I'm a happy camper!",

    "text": "I stopped by here with a friend to celebrate National Margarita Day because they had a deal going on where you could get margaritas for $2.22 each. Devin, was our server and he did a great job taking care of us. We started out of course with a margarita and it tasted pretty good, but they weren't consistent tasting each time. The promotion price was deducted from our bill with no problem and I was glad since the drinks were just so-so.   Grilled Chicken and Tropical Fruit Salad ($12.49) -  Pineapple, red grapes, strawberries and mandarin oranges with goat cheese crumbles, candied almonds and drizzled with Island vinaigrette and grilled chicken. When it came to the chicken I was disappointed because it's described at grilled and the picture of it on the menu shows chicken with grill marks, but mine appeared to be seared instead of grilled and had no flavor at all. The chicken lacking flavor honestly left my mind once I tasted the greens, fruits and dressing underneath because there was a good amount of it and it all melded very well together. Good portion for the price and I'd order it again even if the chicken doesn't live up.  Rebecca's Key Lime Pie ($6.99) - Handmade with a brown sugar crust and golden meringue. I've had this dessert before and it tasted just as good this last visit. It's my favorite on the menu and tastes just right. Love that crust.    Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake ($6.99) - Warm chocolate cake with a chocolate molten center topped with caramelized pineapple and served with raspberry sauce and fresh Island fruit. The first bite tasted a bit like burnt chocolate, but once I got towards the center it was chocolate heaven.   Inside was clean and they have plenty of dining space as well an outdoor patio.   Happy Hour is Monday - Friday 4:00 PM - 6:00 P.M.  Late night Happy Hour is Sunday - Thursday 9:00 PM - Close.",

Happy is the key word:  I was happy that they're open till midnight, happy at the extensive food menu available, and happiest at the triple-flavor Frozen Bahamarita available for 4 bucks.  Having been to a Yelp event at the one in Princeton, NJ, I was pretty familiar with the menu choices.  But I hadn't tried the tostones with chicken, which our waiter recommended.  And I wasn't disappointed.  The large, thick plaintain slices were covered with an impressive amount of chicken, cheese, and other goodies.  Think nachos on speed.  My husband, the non-seafood-eater, let me talk him into the Lobster and Shrimp quesadilla, which came with pico de gallo, sour cream and, I think, guacamole (though that may have been with the tostones.  One Bahamarita is all it takes for me!).  Service was great, the food was delicious, and paying half price was the best of all.",

Service was pretty good, ice teas refilled 3 times during the meal.  My friend ordered conch fritters for an appetizer, a salad, and lobster tacos. I went for a salmon cooked my way, wood flame grilled and almond coated with a lemon butter sauce, side of mashed sweet potatoes, and green beans.  Food was just ok in my opinion. Portions were good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salmon because they put a lot of almond and other stuff on it, which took away from the flavor of the lemon butter sauce and the meat. The conch fritters were good, but a little greasy...never had them before so maybe that's the way they are supposed to be, but I was expecting something a little lighter.  I'd love to hang out at the bar sometime and enjoy some tropical cocktails. I don't think they ever seem to get very busy.   Not sure I'll return....seems there are more options and better places to eat, but it was a decent meal for about $18 (mine) and an overall bill of $38.",

    "text": "We were starving when we left the Atomic Testing Museum. I suggested Bahama Breeze because it was conveniently close and their Coconut shrimp was beckoning me! I also love their dessert drinks.   I feel like I'm on a mini vacation when I come in here. Maybe it's the Banana Strawberry Daiquiri that puts me in the mood. The sips I took were fantastic ! My husband didn't like his Sangria (they don't serve it with fruit in the glass) so he drank half of my Daiquiri. My sister in law who is the \"non drinker\" wanted to taste it so I let her.    I started with the Coconut Shrimp ($9.49) for an appetizer it is big enough to be the whole meal. I just love the Citrus Mustard sauce it is served with...it's addicting! My sister in law shared her Roasted Cuban Bread ($5.99) . It had sliced vine tomatoes, basil, and Parmesan cheese. It was good ...It think it would be nice to eat with a salad.   My main entree was the Calypso Shrimp Linguine ($13.99 lighter portion). I'm glad I ordered the lighter version because it tasted okay but it was nothing to write home about. It tasted a bit bland to and I would not order it again.   We ended the dinner by ordering two desserts to share with the table. We had the Chocolate Island which is a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie swimming in milk chocolate and vanilla bean anglaise. This was my favorite of the two! The second dessert was Banana Nut Supreme it has sliced bananas and vanilla ice cream topped with butterscotch brandy sauce. It tasted okay but everyone at the table liked the Chocolate Island the best!   This is a nice place to unwind after work because they also have a Happy Hour menu!",

If I have to pick a restaurant outside of our usual rotation, or a place to go with friends, it'll be Bahama Breeze.  An amazing alcoholic drink menu (Painkiller, a bunch of mojitos) as well as some of the best lemonade you'll ever have (Lemon Breeze).  We typically have great service.  This last time featured a waiter that was very into his job and described menu items with words like \"exquisite.\"  It's refreshing to have a waiter who is knowledgeable and happy to help.  The decor is clean and aesthetically pleasing.  We decided to start with the Tostones appetizer, though we weren't quite sure what to expect.  The plantains were crispy and the flavors diverse and delicious.  Despite not being much of a seafood eater, I always go with the fresh fish at the front of the menu.  Normally, it's the mango glazed tilapia.  This time I went with the Mahi Mahi as per the waiter's recommendation.  It wasn't as good as the tilapia, but it was still yummy.  My wife's curry bowl was equally as appetizing.  We left this place as we always do: with a full belly and smiles on our faces.",

I ordered the lobster/shrimp quesadilla with a bowl of the seafood chowder. My quesadilla was fine but nothing to write home about...it could have used some hot sauce. The soup, however, was phenomenal. It was like a crab/shrimp chowder with little fried shrimp on top. It was creamy, smooth, not too salty and hearty enough. It was rich so I couldn't finish it all.

    "text": "We were visiting Las Vegas for relaxation... Wanted to try different restaurants and some food and drinks we don't get often where we live. My husband loves coconut shrimp, so I looked up restaurants that served them. There was  Bahama Breeze and Kahunaville, (which is in T.I.) I made reservations with Kahunaville for later in the week,... (which we HATED)... but went to the early happy hour at Bahama Breeze.(they even have two happy hour times, early and late) Kahunaville, ended up being one HUGE MESS of noise, and the food was mediocre and expensive,( I reckon because it being on the strip).    But back to Bahama Breeze. The place was great! It is in a mall of restaurants and parking was a ...\"breeze\"...(get it?)... It had the atmosphere with the truly tropical feel of  shutters, lanais, wood,  bamboo, gardens, fire pits, open and airy. Man, even the men's restroom was great!    The happy hour menu was fantastic! $3.00 & $4.00 drinks, and 1/2 off appetizers! Our server was Sam, and she was great, fast and efficient. We had the beef empanadas: nice and spicy, with a nice fruity salsa, the warm goat cheese dip with flatbread crisps: GREAT! The cheese comes in warm bell peppers. The coconut shrimp: you get 6 fairly large perfectly seasoned shrimp with a spicy mustard sauce... in fact my husband ordered two of them... The tropical drinks we ordered were far more superior and tasty than Kahunaville... and a lot less expensive!    Over all Bahama Breeze got our vote for BEST \"Island food and drink\" in Las Vegas. In the words of a past Governor of CA, \" I'll be back!\" I want to try it all!",

So far not so good...but the manager had a change of heart...so that was good. We shared a chicken cilantro cream dish that was fabulous. We also had some great chicken sliders, coconut shrimp, and some chicken wings. Overall it was great food, fast service, and cool atmosphere.  We will defnitely come back.",

So we visited a few other places in Las Vegas, then ended at Bahama Breeze where mom wanted Paella. She says other than in Spain, Bahama Breeze makes the best Paella! So we ordered salad, which, by the way, was delicious with an array of cold, crisp vegetables with a dynamite vinaigrette, and two orders of Paella enough to serve four people. We even took some home since we couldn't finish it all. A family member and I ordered a glass of the Merlot which was a nice compliment to our meal. There was no room for dessert! Next time for sure. Definitely worth the trip. Will do this day trip thing again this summer. It was fun! Bahama Breeze is high on the \"do over\" list!",

Me and my friend figured that since the parking lot was full at 2pm on a Friday afternoon...the food must be pretty good. We decided to order our food To-Go and the hostess was very helpful offering some recommendations. We order and we sit around chatting and people watching. After 15 minutes, our food is ready!  I ordered the Oak Grilled Chicken Sandwich with lettuce, tomato and goat cheese on Ciabatta bread....AMAZING! The chicken was tender and juicy and well seasoned. The cheese was slightly melted and the lettuce and tomato were fresh and tasty! I ordered the tomato, basil and balsamic vinegarette salad on the side. I ate that on the way back to the resort so fast..I couldnt really tell you how it tasted...so I assume it was good. After the sandwich and and ice cold beer, I slept for hours :)   Bahama Breeze?? You have a satisfied customer here! Now...build a restaurant in Virginia/DC area please!!",

    "text": "A friend of mine hosted a business dinner here and invited me to join them.  It's been a while since I've visited this joint, so I gladly accepted.  When I arrived, they were already seated and the Appetizers were coming out.  They ordered Coconut Shrimp (Crispy large Shrimp hand-breaded with sweet flaky Coconut & a Citrus-Mustard dipping Sauce) & Creole Baked Goat Cheese (In roasted Red Bell Peppers served with vine-ripened Tomato Salsa and Parmesan Toast).  The Coconut Shrimp was OK, not great.  They're large sized Shrimp.....the Coconut Breading was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The Creole Baked Goat Cheese was excellent!  If you try the Goat Cheese, you have to slice up the Bell Pepper and eat it....it was amazingly good.  For an entree, I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta (Jerk Chicken Breast, fresh Asparagus and Mushrooms tossed in a rich Parmesan-Herb Cream Sauce with Bow-Tie Pasta).  They weren't kidding when they said this dish was \"rich\".....I think I gained 5 lbs after eating this thing.....it was very good though.  Despite being rich, the Sauce didn't overwhelm the dish and it had a nice flavor.  The Jerk Chicken was cooked perfectly and was of good quality.....you could taste the flavor that Jerk Chicken is known for....I was left wanting more.  Thank God it wasn't bottomless, otherwise I'd have to buy new clothes afterwards....ha!  Overall, it was good service and good food.  This place is a solid 4 Stars.  Return Factor - 82%",

Upon entering I saw 3 people to my right at the front desk.  They all spoke & seemed friendly, however they took over 2 minutes to decide where to seat me because of a seating issue.  Come on guys I'm hungry.  After being seated the server came and wanted to know what me & guest wanted to drink.  She explained dinner menu, drink menu and her recommendations.  She came back in 2 minutes and still we were deciding on menu.   She said she would be back in a few minutes which turned out to be over 15 minutes.  She had a rather large table to serve which took up a lot of her time.  She finally came back.  Order came within 20 minutes later.  They had a male singer performing top 40 hits.  I guess that was ok.  Decor was decent, beachy like.  I ordered a seafood rice dish(see pic).  It was tasty but kinda dry.  They needed some sauce to keep rice from getting dry.  I used hot sauce.  Noise level was ok.  Semi crowded.  Server came back to refill drinks.  We finished dinner and were waiting for the check which took almost 20 minutes.  Another server had to take our payment.  Server apologized but she was working way too many tables.  Would I return - not sure.  Food was good but nothing that would make me want to rush back.  Service was sub par.",

The service was great from the moment we walked in and our server was spot on! Ordered some happy hour drinks, a pretty tasty Ultimate Pina Colada and a Bahamarita, both blended drinks. To eat we started off with the small plate of Jerk chicken wings, they were fresh and flavorful. For our entrees we ordered the Taste of Jamaica, which was basically a sampler plate of a couple items  from the menu that were all very good and a plate of the Key West Fish tacos that were a bit disappointing and dry . Nonetheless the up beat atmosphere and nice mix of Caribbean music was great. Definitely will be back to try out more things on the menu and hopefully catch the live music they have from time to time. 8/10",

The chipotle chicken salad is not to be missed, if you are in the mood for a salad.  Lettuce was crisp. The blend of fresh corn, black beans and cheeses combined with the light vinaigrette, wow!  The chicken was moist with just the right amount of seasoning to make your tastebuds happy.  If you are in Vegas, a must try!",

No exaggeration - these two fellas were on top of it!!! Plenty of conversation & lots of suggestions of cool things to do during our stay.  Now about the food .... WOW! Everything tasted fresh & amazing. Our appetizers were like entrees they were so big! We loved the seared sesame crusted Ahi, coconut shrimp & chicken quesadillas. If we didn't come hungry & ready to pack in some grub the appetizers would have been enough because we also had cocktails. But we also ordered bowls! The plantain bowl was my favorite!!!! sweet & salty all in one dish and I was able to substitute the ground beef for jackfruit #Vegetarian.   This may become a regular stop whenever we visit Vegas! But ONLY if we post up at the bar - the service in regular dining started off suspect & unimpressive LOL",

However I have tried to go again the past two times for dinner, and the wait times were atrocious and the hostesss were very lazy.  On the first occasion, I asked why the delay as there were plenty of clean tables and what appeared to be no shortage of waiters. I was told that section was not ready for seating yet (yet there was people eating) the first time. I left after 30 minutes of waiting.  So on my second attempt I scheduled a reservation on the website 30 minutes prior, I showed up on time and still had to wait 30 minutes (I timed it too!). Once again there was open seats with clean tables and no shortage of waiters. When I asked whats the point of a reservation if I cant get seated near the reservation time, I was told don't worry the pager will go off real soon. I waited 20 minutes and left very agitated.",

My husband went with the Oscar steak and I went with the Steak churrasco. Only complaint is that my black beans were more soupy and didn't really have many beans and I asked for medium and hubs well done and they accidentally got it switched. Besides that no complaints, food was delicious and our server was great. Will definitely be back",

I ordered the jerk chicken and it was done right but the flavor was a HUGE disappointment! I have ordered and taste better jerk chicken than the one served on this plate (see pics) just one bite and immediately I realize I was in America when I was hoping to be taken back to Jamaica by way of its food & flavor. The spice was NONE existent! The marinate was lacking and the Heat and taste of Jamaica was definitely missing from this dish!   The sauce that was served with this dish is flavorful with fruits and veggies that reminds me of being on a Tropical Island eating fresh organic vegetables and sweet fresh fruits!   The dining environment is buzzing, energetic and live! So IF you're and introvert trying to enjoy your meal in a quiet or formal environment this place is NOT for you!",

    "text": "Bahama Breeze......OMGGGGGG where have you been and WHY isn't there one in California!?!? Stopped by due to 3 recommendations from associates and I am glad that I listened. Our waiter was cool, and took time going over the menu specials AND it was happy hour. The jerk wings were simply AMAZING!!! Let me repeat....AMAZING! They were cooked perfectly, served hot and the skin was beautiful golden brown (like me) and crispy! Those wings bring a serious smile to my face, even as I write this review! I also had the mini-margarita trio which was very very good. We were able to try their onion rings which are now discontinued but they also had a great crunch to them and were served HOT! The hubz had a Pina Colada drink that he liked it more than I did and the coconut shrimp, which was ok to me, nothing to go into detail about. Take is from me, a 100%, True wing connoisseur, you wont regret ordering them! I will definitely return here again.",

To start we ordered the spinach dip which was not that good. It needs more cheese, kind of bland. We also had the firecracker shrimp and breeze of cheese balls. Everyone loved the shrimp but I didn't have any. The drinks were good. One person got the flight of margaritas and of course some were better than others. The portion was very generous. Another person got the coconut mojito which was very good. For entrees we got the Jamaican stuffed plantain bowl which she enjoyed. I got the lobster and shrimp linguine and it was okay. Overall, it was a fun experience with okay food. I would only return if a group I was with wanted to go.",

I enjoyed it so much.... several nights later when most of my friends went to Morton's- I opted to come back with my daughter. Our server on the second night was Anita- and she was just as excellent as Margo.   We ordered the tacos (so good had to choose them again)  Protein style cheese burger- just \"ok\" Adler beer is INCREDIBLE   Top notch waitresses, yummy food, fun atmosphere and good prices.

    "text": "My husband and I usually go here with his parents for the holidays or special occassions. His Grandma always sends a gift card to this restaurant. I'm guessing it's one of her favorites. On this occassion I had the ahi salad appetizer and an iced tea.   I saw ahi on the menu and I knew I had to have it. I've been on a real tuna kick lately and the menu pic looked divine. When I received my plate... after a very long wait it looked exactly like the menu. It was stunning.   Sadly it didn't taste like they seared the tuna in sesame oil, so there wasn't a ton of flavor. Also it was an appetizer and not an entree. I knew this going in, but there was no entree sized ahi, and I wanted ahi bad. I ate it and I was still hungry. I resorted to stealing french fries off my husband's plate when he wasn't looking.   The decor was beautiful and there is even a fun little waterfall and river running through the restraunt. I had lots of time to walk around and snap photos because the service was exceptionally slow. The iced tea tasted fresh brewed and was quite good. Despite slow service, my glass was usually full so I was grateful for that.   So the bottom line... It was ok. I will be back. I wish they had a full size ahi salad, and I wish they used sesame oil to sear and maybe a touch of wasabi on the side just for fun. I've had better tasting dishes here that were more filling, so maybe next time I'll grab the entree portion of the shrimp instead.",

I would have given them another star but during my last 2 visits, I was completely ignored and had to flag or get up & find a waiter to request service after being seated over 15 minutes. WTH?!! This occurred in the dinning area & at the bar. Once I did get their attention, their service was attentive & on-point.   They have a great Happy-Hour going on twice a day. Half price appetizers and beer & well drink specials. I recommend the coconut fried shrimp, the firecracker shrimp tacos, and the chicken wings. The beef empanadas are good but can be a bit heavy if you eat more than two. They have great margaritas also. Not too sweet and taste like fresh squeezed lime...very refreshing. I will continue to return. Good bar food with a \"tropical\" twist at decent prices. Hopefully, I will not be ignored when I sit at the bar or table next time!!!",

Peruvian Corn Cakes bristling with kernels of yellow corn were quite tasty slathered with butter and topped by a vibrant and fruity housemade Pineapple Salsa.  A Caesar Salad with fresh Romaine leaves and sheets of Mozzarella Cheese was graced with an excellent Caesar Dressing.  And, an abundant portion of sauteed Mahi Mahi with Shrimp Saute in Lemon Cream Sauce that was presented with fine Spanish Rice was moist, flakey, perfectly cooked, and delicious.

My friend and I decided to eat here instead because there was plenty of parking and it had good reviews on yelp.  We started off ordering the panko onion rings as an appetizer, They were pretty good, I'm not a fan of panko bread crumbs but my friend is so we got them. We also got a side caesar salad, It was so light and delicious. It also had shaved pieces of parmesan cheese and the croutons tasted homemade.   For the entree, we decided to split the Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the menu said it had shrimp in every bite so I needed to see if that was True. I love shrimp so I had to try it. They gave us the plate and there was a lot of shrimp, I mean, a lot! It was awesome! The linguine was perfectly cooked al dente, the pasta was sauteed with garlic, onion and tomatoes with a hint of spice and cream. The amount of cream was perfect and not overwhelming and there literally was shrimp in every bite. Pastas are usually topped with shrimp, this one also had shrimp in between. It was so good and the price was awesome! $18.00 for a large portion which my friend and I could not finish. We left some pasta, I ate all the shrimp and enjoyed every single one of them.  The desserts looked yummy but we could not try them because we were stuffed.   I love this place, hope to go back soon.",

Their Pina cola da is  an island twist off the norm with strawberry swirled throughout, so yummy.  Their habanero wings were great with a sweet and spicy sauce which only left a slight tingle on the tongue but still packed with flavor.  We also enjoyed the jerk shrimp appetizer which was shrimp scampi bathing in a pond of buttery broth with very subtle jerk seasoning, not overpowering like I had anticipated, and served with a French bread loaf for soaking up the flavorful broth.  My entree was their special: A lobster, shrimp, and mussel bowl with baby potatoes and butternut squash, swimming in a tomato herb soup also served with French bread for dipping.  Slightly different seasoning compared to the Italian or cuban versions I've had before, with similar seasoning as their jerk shrimp, but not overpowering.  Overall the food was great and the service started out good, but at the end we sat waiting for our server and bill, so a little let down there, but otherwise a real treat!",

I strongly suggust the Crab Claws St. Thomas as an appetizer, and the Shrimp Liguine as a main course.  We were too full to do dessert, but I image it would be wonderful as well!",

Now, I won't die if I get cilantro, but it's kind of unpleasant to my body and it tastes like soap. I got a few bites in and he came running to the table panicking about how the sauce turns out to have cilantro in it. He sent the manager over who recommended a new dish, didn't charge me for either, and then gave me another drink which was hella strong.  The fact that they showed so much concern even though I explained to them that it's not a fatal allergy unless I get a fair amount in me, shows me that they care about their clients.   The replacement dish, the mahi-mahi in a cream mango sauce, was absolutely to die for. Especially with a strawberry mojito. (the mango one was pretty bad, but was accidentally brought to my table by an errant waitress and I just took it rather than my strawberry one)  Would I go back? Definitely. The food was good, the service was very pleasant, and they apologized profusely for their mistake, while making sure I was very well taken care of. I'd gladly recommend this to any of my friends.",

The atmosphere was light and fun, and I think everyone had a good time!  The only reason I only gave it 4 stars was because a few times throughout the night the staff would come up to me and ask me what to do or what needed to be done, and I kind of felt like it should be their job to already know what should/needed to be done.  Other than that the staff was very friendly and we enjoyed ourselves!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE, AWFUL experience at Bahama Breeze the other day.  We were seated right away for an early lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.  Our server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fiance.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, \"I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?\"  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.  I have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.  The manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.    We paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.  Steer clear of this place - the service is sub-par.  There are much better places to dine in this city.",

Only items that stood out were the seafood chowder and wings.  Burger was not very good, something about all the ingredients and manchego cheese just did not work well together.  Their signature lemonade with cane sugar is very good.  Overall, the ambiance is cute and tropical inside.  Nice getaway from the Vegas crowds!!",

We are so glad that we did it on this visit.  we were sat out in the gazebo area which added a nice touch to the evening.  Daniel was our server who tended to us with a great smile all evening long. His recommendations were on point! My wife and I had the Jerk chicken with the bow tie pasta mushrooms and asparagus in a very delicious creamy sauce. Our daughter had the Jamaican Jerk chicken with ripe plantains rice and black beans; she was in heaven and ditch the fork in order to enjoy the chicken to the fullest. Grandma had the grilled chicken sandwich which she reported there were no extra frills so it was just good.  Somehow we managed to have enough room for dessert and are now in a very delighted sureene sugar state of being. Daniel again pointed us in the right direction and we decided to have the banana nut rum bread with caramel sauce and ice cream and the chocolate pineapple upside down lava cake, do I need to say more?   If you are ever in Las Vegas, this is a place that you can not just drive passed.",

My paella was delicious and so was my boyfriend's chicken and yuca. Their mixed drinks were also pretty tasty too.",

They had well over a dozen drinks.  A whole page in the menu, and a             booklet on the table.  Unfortunately, the two that I tried were pretty bad.  The first was a zombie.  This drink didn't look, or taste like any zombie I've ever had, and I've had a few.  I actually wondered if my order got mixed up somewhere.  Whatever it was, it was mediocre at best.  I thought a strawberry mojito would be a safer bet, since that's almost impossible to mess up.  Well...almost, right?  It looked, and tasted more like a bad daiquiri.  It was way too sweet, and apparently made with Pucker.  The only mojito thing about it was the physical presence of mint in the glass.  I tried a friend's cocktail- The Painkiller, and wasn't too into that either.  The mix of rum, and coconut cream is nice, but again, way too sweet. The food was...okay.  Our friend ordered the jerk chicken, and seemed to really enjoy it.  We wanted to order some fish.  Three varieties were available, but they were out of the one that we wanted.  The salmon was cooked well, but the sides were not.  Gummy mashed potatoes, and oily under cooked green beans.  Oh well, at least they weren't frozen.   I won't be rushing back here anytime soon.",

I was recommended by some Las Vegas residents to try Bahama Breeze.   Wednesday night on January 14, 2015 was the first time I visited Bahama Breeze to have a meal.  This night I had my cousin and her family from Henderson join me for the dinner.  I found out that they have not eaten at Bahama Breeze as well.  A first time dining experience for the entire family to enjoy.  A total of six individuals in our group (M1, M2, and M3 are the men.  F1, F2, and F3 are the females).  F1 (my cousin) ordered the garden salad and the ribs with fries.  F2 (me) ordered the Bahamian Seafood Chowder and Buttermilk Chicken Piccata with mashed potatoes.  M1 (cousin's companion) ordered the coconut shrimp appetizer as well as the coconut shrimp meal with broccoli.  M2 (companion's son) ordered a Portabello Burger with fries.  M3 (cousin's son) and F3 (companion's daughter) both ordered pasta.  One had asparagus and mushroom in the pasta while the other eliminated the asparagus.  Everyone finished their meal.  They all agreed that what they ordered for dinner was delicious.  Each dish was served with the right portion...just enough to make a person stuffed to the max.   The restaurant itself is pretty big.  There's one section of the restaurant that can be used for reserved parties and it had a television for the customers to watch.  There was dinner music provided by a man playing the guitar and he sang a lot of cover songs.  He was located near the bar area and right behind the wishing pond.  The ceiling fans are actually the propellers from the boats.  The restrooms were very clean and there was a mouthwash dispenser for customers to use before or after a meal....that's one thing you hardly see in restaurant restrooms.    Overall everyone enjoyed the first time dining experience here at Bahama Breeze.  Employees were friendly and the waiters made sure that the drinks were not empty. Facility was clean and very beautiful.  Another major plus about the restaurant is that Bahama Breeze passed the Nevada health inspection by receiving a grade A. For my cousin and her extended family it would be a once in every six months treat for date night or family outings since the entree items are pricey.",

Before the dish was brought out correctly the manager came over (with a slight attitude) to ask what the problem was, and after he explained he pretty much made excuses and admitted that certain foods weren't made fresh and authentic to any Caribbean way. The whole conversation was unnecessary for him to come over defensive, I didn't ask for any dishes to be compt just made right.   I will drink at bahama breeze occasionally and eat light appetizers, but not certain dishes.",

We sat in the patio area where there was a live musician playing reggae classics, very enjoyable.   I ordered the habanero wings and a classic margarita. The wings did not seem to be habanero. More of spicy BBQ sauce rather than habanero. They were actually pretty good, but calling them habanero is very misleading. For the drinks, it appears the other reviewers are correct. They are either watered down, or have barely and alcohol in them at all. My classic margarita tasted like pure lime mix. I had to order a beer instead. Be cautious of that before ordering.   All in all, I would give this place a second try again. :)",

I usually get their jerk chicken pasta which has asparagus and mushroom in it. I usually replace the mushrooms with bacon and it's amazing. I also highly recommend any of their lemonades they're so fresh and good. Other people in my group have tried the jerk chicken sandwich and said it was great as well and also the chicken with the cilantro crema it comes with mashed potatoes and corn and that's very good too. I haven't had anything bad from here yet! However the service isn't the best. No matter when we go it's always very slow. We find ourselves constantly asking and waiting for refills. The staff is very nice and I understand it gets busy but even when we go on a slow day the service is still slow. But overall I highly recommend this place! Definitely try the pasta and lemonade and try to sit in their little outdoor area it's really nice!",

My friend is vegan and asked if she could make her own salad and the waiter said no and he didn't seem like he was in a good mood...then my other friend asked him what is in the seafood chowder and he said \"it's creamy.\" uhm, yeah I am aware that chowder is creamy but what is in it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt on that because I just assumed he was new and maybe didn't know.   I orders the tortilla soup and lobster quesadilla. I've had it before and it has never failed. When I got my food, a ton of the soup was spilled out onto the plate that had the quesadilla so my food was all wet and soggy. I posted a picture of it.  I didn't send it back because I was here for lunch and didn't have time to wait any longer because I had to get back to work for a meeting.   I've had some pretty decent experiences here and the food is pretty good. It's a shame that my last experience here was not great. It could have been that maybe the waiter was new, but who knows.",

    "text": "This used to be fantastic, every year for the past 5 years a group of family and extended family would get together and have an annual December birthday/holiday party. In January of this year, unfortunately, Bahama Breeze got a new marketing director and she decided to change the way reservations and areas were assigned. Every year we would request to be seated out where the live music was, for two reasons. 1. There is usually 25-30 of us, we're all loud and so to not disrupt the of other guests this worked fabulously. 2. It allows the kids in our party to have fun dancing to the live music, and it provides a big enough area for our Santa to come in for the kids. This year when making our reservation I was told the only way to get this area, this year was to book it in advance with deposit and we'd have to eat off of a predetermined menu. Unfortunately, the time we wanted was already booked. I talked to the Manager and let her know that we'd like to still make the reservation for 29 people for 12/15 @ 530p, please make sure we are all in an area where we can ALL sit together and if someone canceled for that area please call me.  We showed up at 530p on 12/15, I explained that the number had dropped from 29 to 23. It took them a few minutes to get the area situated, not a problem. The problem was that they had 1 table that sat 10 people, two booths down from the table and 1 booth across. Issue #1 - This is not what we discussed. I specifically told the Manager when making the reservation we'd ALL need to sit together. She said no problem, we can do that.  Issue #2 - Waiting staff was a mess, we had (2) people waiting on us Jelli & Brandon J. I was the host of the party, so I took on the job of getting the staff updated to how the billing could work to lessen confusion for them and to ask me if they had any questions. Jelli said she understood and that it would be great if we made sure for ordering reason if the people could please stay in their sits to order so they could make sure not to mess anyone orders up. No problem, completely understand. We proceeded to order drinks, we waited, and waited and waited for drinks. to the point that some of our group found it easier to go directly to the bar to get their drink instead of waiting on Jelli or Brandon. Issue #3 - Jelli's forgetfulness, several members of our group would order drinks from Jelli and she would forget to place the order or bring the wrong item to the wrong table.  Issue #4 - Brandon's attitude, Brandon was standoffish and pushy to a few of the members of our group. We had a member of our group come in as Santa for the kids in our group. During the filming, Brandon kept walking through the experience, through people filming, which was completely uncalled for, because we purposely left an area around the table for additional customers/servers to get to and from the patio. And to make sure we did not disrupt the flow of foot traffic any more than necessary. At one point Brandon told me I had to make a direct line from the patio to the bar and that everyone would need to move. Again, completely uncalled for on his part. Issue #5 - Billing & Wrapping up - Once everyone had received and finished their meals, a lot of us ordered more drinks and were talking amongst ourselves, Brandon decided it was time for us to wrap it up and it would be a good idea to go to the booth of kids and say: \"Your bill is not paid, who is paying your bill?\". Again completely uncalled for, as stated above, Brandon knew from my talk with Jelli that any questions could be brought to my attention and I would get them any answer or provide the plan.  We spend close to $1000 every year at Bahama Breeze during this one event. I can only hope that upper management from Bahama Breeze takes a real hard look at the way their employees handle the customers as well as how even the smallest of things (new pre-set menu/patio area rule) effects their customers. It saddens me that a place we once looked forward to coming and celebrating with our family, has let us down so badly, that next year we will be looking for a new place for our celebration.   Sincerely, The White Family & Friends",

    "text": "We sent back 2 dishes and decided not to order anything else. My entire mouth was assaulted by salt.   We tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after 2 bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty; I couldn't get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.  The flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic - It didn't offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didn't even taste much jerk seasoning - only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for 3 people to share.   Also, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and Yard-House makes it better.   The manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes. He also offended us by suggesting that we probably didn't know what jerk seasoning tasted like. lol. I'm not even going to argue it. We ended up heading to In-N-Out and grabbing some burgers after this failed dinner.",

Let me start by saying the waitstaff was OUTSTANDING so I would give them a 4 Stars not 2. Drink orders were taken and delivered timely and correct throughout the 2 hours we were there. Most people ordered dinner. This is where some \"issues\" came up. The entrees all started coming out at once and many had ordered soups and appetizers which were nowhere to be seen. The calamari was extremely tasteless and rubbery...old, stale calamari is basically uneatable, and we didn't. The chicken sliders on plantains were OK but not very flavorful without the sauce that was mostly spicy mayo. The black bean soup was EXCELLENT and I can highly recommend that. The skirt steak churrasco was tough and not very flavorful at all. Cocktails were all good.  I would teach the waiters and kitchen staff that apps and soups ALWAYS go out before entrees. And you need to either get better quality calamari or take it off the menu all together.",

    "text": "I like Bahama Breeze for something a little different.  It is part of the Darden family of restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Long Horn Steakhouse) but this is neither Italian, seafood or steak.  Sure, they have pasta, fish and beef but that is not what they're about.   Bahama Breeze is about the feel of the Caribbean.  The place looks like a beach resort that one may find in, say, the Bahamas. There are palm trees, torches, fruity cocktails and an overall laid back atmosphere.  The menu is substantial and has something for just about anybody.  It is a restaurant/menu I have been enjoying for over 10 years.    I started coming here with my office for a holiday party.  Then we came back for a retirement party.  And again for a going away party.  Maybe even two.  I've come in with family a couple of times now also.  Each time I stop in I try somthing different.  Coconut shrimp (amazing and unfortunately not an option for me any more), chicken skewers and rice (not on the menu any more), West Indies curry rice bowl, jerk chicken pasta, buttermilk fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  I've tried the black bean soup.  I've tried a salad.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've had here.  I've had some of the drinks too.  A sample of the coconut mojito which was good but very sweet.  A taste of the watermelon jalepeno margarita.  A zombie (which I seem to remember liking very much).  I did have an off pint of Guiness once.  Not sure what happened to that keg but it wasn't good.  However, I've also had a Newcastle here and it was spot on.    Service has always been consistent and pleasent.  Even coming in on Mother's Day with a 7:00 PM reservation went off without a hitch.  We were seated just before our scheduled time and were waited on equally quick.  Having taken the time to look at the drinks and food, we ordered and just got to talking.  Before we knew it we had all that we had ordered and the meal had begun.  We were out of there by 8:15.  Not bad considering how busy this place was on a holiday.",

Many appetizer options we tried the beef empanadas, and didn't finish them as the flavor was off, the the filling was too runny and the ground beef sparse. The Spinach dip needed salt and pepper because there was no flavor, aside from the apps the meal was really good and so was the service.  The honey siracha chicken sandwich with a side of fruit and sorbet was bomb! The Cobb salad great, the buttermilk lemongrass chicken amazing!",

On a whim, a colleague loved this place so introduced this restaurant to us so we came here and tried several dishes. The place felt lively, yet relaxing. I particularly liked my virgin ultimate pineapple drink -  essentially pina colada and strawberry ice in a freshly cut pineapple without the alcohol. It's so refreshing & satisfying! The Jamaican chicken was just okay and the portion was plentiful.  the waiter was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy the atmosphere and conversations.  Another reason to dine here is that it's pretty close to the strip, has plenty of parking and easy to hail a cab or get rideshare to and fro.  I would definitely return if in a mood of something different and tropical in Vegas.",

    "text": "For those who want to whisk themselves away to an island adventure in the middle of the desert, there's plenty of Caribbean-themed restaurants in town for one to sate their needs. Of these, Bahama Breeze is one of the few that would count as a chain restaurant specializing in Caribbean and island cuisine -- located in the Hughes Center off the Strip, it's a good place to unwind without getting roped into the hustle and bustle of the Strip!  I came here with my mother and her friends over the weekend to catch up after our previous get-together at the District left us disappointed -- and this time we were more than satisfied with what we ordered. If you want good service, ask for Travis by name!  We started off by splitting the Jamaican jerk wings -- and they were so juicy and flavorful, we were even gnawing on the bones after! My mother, one of her friends and I then opted to split three different dishes -- their grilled salmon and tostada salad, the seafood paella, and the braised oxtail -- while our other friend opted to get the skillet jerk shrimp and black bean soup.  When our entrees came out, we were all blown away with how delicious everything was! The salmon salad was light and flavorful, the seafood paella was filling and very savory, and the braised oxtail was rich and meaty -- again, I was sucking on the bones to get all the meat off! I also got a virgin Bahamarita to wash down our food, and it was a delightfully light counterpoint to the strongly-flavored dishes we ordered. Our friend also said that the black bean soup and the shrimp was to her liking.  The biggest surprise for us came at dessert, though -- we ordered the coconut grande, a warm coconut cake with coconut pineapple ice cream, pineapple and toasted coconut ( if you're allergic to or don't like coconut, there's plenty of other desserts like the rum cake or the Chocolate Island that are to your liking ). It was so good and so refreshing that we ended up ordering a second one because the dessert was just that good!  The main reason why our experience was only four stars and not five, however, is due to the service near the end of the meal -- we had another server attending to us who regularly forgot our requests, didn't fill up our drinks, and overall didn't give us the kind of attention Travis gave us when he was attending to us.  During our meal, we commented about how we felt like we were on a stay-cation of our own because of how relaxed the atmosphere was -- and that's really the whole point of Bahama Breeze, to encourage its diners to relax and forget about their troubles for a few moments while breeding through Caribbean fare! ( Pun not intentional. ) If you're looking for a good place to unwind on a work day or on a weekend, Bahama Breeze is a great place to go!",

I am so excited that they have added a new dish to their menu, Tequila Salmon. Fresh mangos and other fruits on the topping. Sweet mashed potatoes and fresh greens. The music playing made me feel like I was right on the islands of the Bahamas. We had fresh guacamole and chips for the appetizer which was slamming. Since it was my birthday I got the rum raid which is 6 alcoholic beverages on a tray. I think I drank all but one which was a little strong with ginger but the rest to die for!! I came with a party of 5. The others ordered...a honey bbq burger , chicken with plantains , some sort of pasta dish and steak. They all said it was really really good. Our waitress was super nice and kept the drinks coming!! There was no wait tonight which was nice but it still got pretty busy. They really keep this location pretty and clean! I will always come back here ! My favorite restaurant hands down",

She said they were going to bring it. However, about 10 minutes later our waitress brings a birthday dessert to the table across from us. I assumed maybe they would bring out my friends dessert soon afterwards but another five minutes passed and the waitress walked by giving us a look like \"why are they still here?\". We ended up leaving. I was bummed that I couldn't make my friend's birthday any special. But more frustrated that the staff was unreliable to help out.",

When we arrived tables were not set up, we had to set up ourselves. It took thirty minutes before our orders were taken, then it took another hour and a half to get out food. Keep in mind we were prepaid and had three items from the menu to choose from, burger, tacos, or pasta (not complicated dishes). The food tasted good, however some were cold by the time we got it. Also 6 people did not receive their food until 30 minutes after most of the party received their food. And in the end two people never received any food at all.   Over all it was a terrible experience, if you are traveling in a large group DO NOT go to this restaurant. I don't know how it is when you are with two or three people verse 60, but clearly the restaurant can not handle large parties, and should have NEVER accepted us as such a large party.",

I keep hearing good things about this place, but I was disappointed. They sat us in the patio area. The patio is a nice open window area with a gas fireplace in the center. The fire creates a nice mood and the fresh air is lovely. However, its not the greatest on a warm day. Also you can smell the gas or propane that fuels the fire when down wind. It can be nauseating after a while. Our server is a nice guy, but noticeably disinterested. We place our order with an appetizer. The appetizer is delivered but utensils or napkins were not provided. We flagged an employee, and let him know we didn't have any napkins or utensils. A few minutes later he produced a handful of cocktail napkins. We needed to flag another person for the rest. The appetizer tasted horrible. Ahi tuna should not have a heavy fish flavor. Our main order was delivered by an individual who was not amused by our misunderstanding of what he said when asking \"who ordered what\". It was clear that he was quite unhappy with this duty. I had ordered a Cuban sandwich. It tasted fine, but was ordinary. You can find the same quality at any subway or port of subs. Nothing impressive. We decided we had enough and requested the check...I can still taste the tuna, it was pretty bad.",

She was very attentive and polite. She had asked us if we had been there before so she could properly introduce us to the menu and even made a few suggestions. I ordered coffee and mentioned I was tired and Jaime frequently stopped by to check if I needed more coffee.  I ordered their fish tacos with fries. I really enjoyed their spread for the tacos it had a nice zing to it. The entree came with 3 tacos so it is a large serving. My boyfriend order the chicken and mashed sweet potatoes. YUM! The restaurant is huge. Tall ceilings and lots of sectioned off seating areas with different decor, which made it visually appealing. There was lots of seating in the hostess area as well. I thought the wooden beach chairs were a nice touch. I would definitely return to this establishment.",

Another favorite is the Jamaican Grilled Wings, they are slow roasted to get the skin crispy, but once you bite into them you will taste the tender chicken they pair them with spicy jerk sauce (which you will most likely want your own for dunking)  Drink favorite- Frozen Bahamarita! sweet, tangy and freshing.  This is a must try when in VEGAS! Enjoy!",

I was surprised we were able to get a reservation for 10, but it seemed like 7p was a bit early.  The food is pretty good, and for the price you can't really beat it.  I know that Vegas has all sorts of buffets, but there is something somewhat sad about buffets; most people concentrate on eating.  The ambience is great despite the somewhat tacky props and decor.  I'd imagine I'd give this more of a 3.5, but since they were so accomodating about adding another table (to make 10 from 8) and since I had such a good time (it being NYE), why the heck not, 4 stars for everyone!",

I always get the fish in season, which comes with the chef's veggies and some sort of starch - my favorite being cinnamon mashes sweet potatoes. Every time, the fish is cooked perfectly and the service impeccable. So, for a fabulous, very reasonably priced lunch or dinner, and away from the craziness of the strip, this place is a nice option.

(Apparently there is also a reverse happy hour that happens 9-close!) We LOVE it.  With its tropical, breezy, just-sitting-out-on-the-veranda ambience, their specialty drinks are matched to boot. We usually indulge in these $4 perfectly garnished and charming cocktails. Ultimate Pina Colada, Bahamarita, Mojito Cubano, Pineapple Coconut Martini. (I've tried them all except the sangria and margarita on the rocks.) They're so pretty that you'll want to bust out your phone and be that person at the table. You know, *that* person.  If this doesn't suit your fancy, they also offer select beers for $2-$3, wines $2 off, and the standard mixed spirits for $3.   Appetizers are half-off and are consistent with the quality of their drinks - flavorful, garnished appropriately, infused and influenced with its caribbean namesake. They offer a wide variety, so all mouths are sure to find something to pique their taste buds. The coconut shrimp seems to be a popular choice, but I recommend the beef empanadas, which is what I ordered on a recent visit.   Round up your friends, relax and take a breather at \"Bahama Breeze.\" Totally worth it.",

So for those of you who do happy hour with co workers, friends, significant others, on a date...etc..I think this would be a great place to go to whichever the occasion is.  For those who are always indecisive with decisions, Bahama Breeze's menu may be hard for you to choose just one thing to order. I was in between a couple dishes but in the end, I went for something healthy: a shrimp rice bowl with grilled/sauteed veggies. Portions were on point for lunch. It was just the right amount to fill me up without that \"ugh, I feel so fat and bloated\" feeling. However, I DO get full easily though so hmm... My boyfriend got the Caribbean jerk chicken pasta. There was mushrooms in it also. Mine cost $8.95 and his pasta cost....$10-13 I think??? It's been awhile so don't quote me on the exact prices.  I will definitely be back.",

We went over obviously with high expectations and we were not let down whatsoever.   I would like to mention that the service here is phenomenal. Our waitress, Tina, was probably one of the nicest waitresses I have had in along time. She was personable, she would talk and joke with us and just super nice. I have no complaints about service at all.   The atmosphere in this place is pretty rad as well. There was live music, a little covered deck with a fire pit, and a lot of cool decorations that made for a great environment. This place is mainly a seafood restaurant, so if that's not your thing then this place probably isn't for you. I'm a huge seafood fan so I loved it.   Last of all, the sought after pina colada that we were searching town for were hands down the best I've ever had! There was more to it than just your average pina colada, it was called the \"ultimate pina colada\" for a reason. Me and my girlfriend both were very impressed with it. We weren't too hungry so we just got some street tacos to shared and they were great as well.  We sat and hung out at this place and just talked for a while because it was such a great environment to just relax and have a great time.  If you're in Vegas,  GO TO THE BAHAMA BREEZE! You will not be disappointed.",

Service given to us by Billy was good despite a lot of customers and he was covering a lot of tables. He was able to come visit us 2 times to check on us and he was read to offer us napkins before we asked.  Two thumbs up to Bahama breeze grille, definitely to be recommended! Keep it up!",

    "text": "Although I've only been to Bahama Breeze in Las Vegas once, I've been plenty of times in Jacksonville Florida when I used to live there, even celebrated my birthday there. So I think due time for a review.  This restaurant is actually one of my favorite places to dine; it's not \"fine\" dining, but it's not cheap casual. It's a nice in between kinda place, affordable but definitely appropriate for special occasions   They have awesome fruity speciality drinks but also a full bar so your dark liquors as well and standard type drinks. They have HH from 9pm-close Sunday thru Thursday which is great for Vegas! Love reserve HH!! And their HH includes food items as well.   This BB is way bigger here in Vegas than the one in Jacksonville. Bigger restaurant means bigger decor and displays inside. Pretty standard dim lighting and Caribbean decor. We came on a Friday and surprisingly it was not busy at all. They had a small dj at the outside patio playing hip hop music that did not seem to fit the theme for the restaurant but the inside music was more fitting and appropriate to the island theme.   They have a wide variety menu all incorporating an island type theme and taste, but I love how their menu is separated and really makes selection an easy task.   I'm a sucker for their establishment favorite the Coconut Shrimp. I think I get it every time as an appetizer! The crispy coconut batter on the butterfly shrimps are fried to perfection and that citrus mustard dipping sauce is almost like a marmalade glaze. Not too sweet tho and that mustard almost like a Dijon flavor gives it a nice kick! Definitely one of my fav dishes here.   My family was having seafood this night (we refrain from meat on Fridays during Lent) and this place has lots of seafood options, well lots of options period. We had the Key West Shrimp and Grits, Calypso Shrimp Linguine, the Fish Tacos, and the Island Hopper (it comes with jerk chicken but we just saved it to bring home).   The shrimp and grits was good, but I wish there was more grits that came with the dish. But the garlic light cream sauce on the shrimp was good and not too heavy, just right. The green beans at accompanied the dish were good, just needed a dab on pepper.   The calypso shrimp linguine was the best tasting of the 4 main dishes we ordered. My sisters dish so I can only comment on that I tried a little bit of it, but it was enough and tasted good enough that when I go back I want that to be my order!! It's like a light pink sorta sauce, white cream sauce but with the Caribbean flavors and spices it turns it sorta pink ish. Every good and sauce was not too heavy at all.   My dad had fish tacos accompanied by fries and guacamole. The guc was really good but the tacos shells were a bit too hard.   The island hopper actually is listed as an appetizer, but mom got it as a main entree.  Comes with coconut shrimp, coconut batter covered onion rings, shrimp stuffed hush puppies and jerk chicken. The onion rings were good and the coconut batter adds a nice twist of flavor. The hush puppies also very good. I like that they were not too dense, and nice a light almost fluffy. The dish also comes with the citrus mustard and a pineapple chutney - which also tasted like a sweet with a kick pineapple marmalade or glaze!! You can eat the chutney straight, it's so yummy.   Also the bathrooms are big and nice and I like how the have little mouthwash cups and mouthwash available at the sink so if you're going out straight after dinner, that least you good on the breath check   The place is a chain restaurant, so you get what you expect, but it's great food, reasonable pricing, appropriate for special occasions but not going to blow your wallet like if you were to eat somewhere on strip in Las Vegas and probably get less quantity. It's a good vibes sorta place and the service is good!! S/O to our server Matt for taking good care of us!!   Solid good dining restaurant and I will be back! Yay",

It's a bit corny, but overall tropical fun. It sort of reminded me of Margaritaville.   As for the food my boo and I ended up sharing the fire cracker shrimp and shrimp and lobster quesadilla. Both were very tasty and especially great for such a cheap price. My favorite though was the fire cracker shrimp, it essentially was fried shrimp with a siracha Mayo dipping sauce. I'm sure it's very unhealthy, but so so good.   Can't wait to come back here again for another happy hour. My only wish is they open another location closer to the west side of town.",

If you've ever been to Bahama Breeze you know that the food is amazing! Today I had the firecracker shrimp and once again it didn't fail to please. Definitely recommend this place!",

The happy hour menu was definitely affordable and they had a wide variety of options. We got the nachos, chicken quesadilla and habanero wings. The chicken quesadilla was my top pick. I wanted to like the nachos more, but they were kind of cold and mushy :( and I was really looking forward to those! I only had a few chips before deciding that the calories were not worth the taste. Drinks were strong! Service started off bad (ignored for 15 minutes) but then redeemed when we were greeted by Josh. He was super attentive and checked on us often but not TOO often. He was also very sweet to take off the most expensive app whereas most people would take off the least expensive app.",

On a good note the waitress was good on time of our food out and the appearance of the food was exceptional. For our appetizer we started off with chicken empanadas and cocktails. For our entree's, my daughter and I ordered the  Jamaican jerk chicken with beans and rice and plantains. The food was DELICIOUS and freshly hot as we were eating.   BUT LET ME TELL YOU!!! Not even a hour passed, my daughter and I both had the RUNS from this food. We had to go to the bathroom 2-4 times out the day. Which was RIDICULOUS!!! I would never return back to this restaurant ever again nor will I recommend this place to ANYONE! #ONESTAR",

I really like their jerk chicken pasta and their seafood paella.  But this time, I decided to try something different and ordered their avocado and crab meat salad.  It was so good!  All the ingredients in the salad was very fresh and I got a whole avocado with this salad. They serve the avocado cut in half for me to scoop out myself and mix with the lump crab meat.  This place is quite busy during their lunch hour rush.  Their happy hour between 4 pm to 6 pm rocks with half price appetizers and cheap drinks.  If you like chicken wings, try their Jamaican chicken wings.  Everything I have tried has been tastefully presented and very pleasing to the palate.  If you have never been here before, you must try this place out.  You won't be disappointed as a they have a wide selection of menu items to choose from.  Oh, did I mention their mojitos are to die for!!",

We ordered the chicken quesadilla with the seafood chowder, firecracker shrimp, and the key west fish tacos.   My favorite out of the three were the key west fish tacos. but I want to say the best part of this meal was the sauce for the firecracker shrimp. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't great either. The service made up for the okay food. Our server was quick, attentive, and super nice.  A lot of people said good things about the Happy Hour so I might try that and see if my thoughts change.",

Our experience tonight has truly made us never want to go to this business again. I suggest that anyone that reads this takes this information to heart. My friend had to use the bathroom and he has Parkinsons so he cannot use the bathroom on his own and needed my help. To put this as clean as possibly I was directing his stream in the bathroom when a worker walked in. He made some rude, sarcastic comment to us and walked out. I was shocked. I thought that this harassment would be over but when we returned to our tables the owner came to our table to talk to us. We did not want to scare our dates off so we just apologized but the owner accused us of peeing on the wall. He told us that it was a family friendly establishment and it wouldn't be tolerated. Now this is 2017. I don't understand why people still cannot accept someone for who they are. It has been scientifically proven that the hypothalamus lights up for certain interactions and that it lights up in a different way for one's sexual preference. They cannot change the way they are. The owner refused to believe our story and its sad that he harassed my friend due to his disability. If you have any respect for the people on this earth then please do not come to this business. They are extremely homophobic and provided a miserable experience. The food was not even that good and not worth the prices that they were. Pathetic.",

Some of the food items aren't all that great with a few being grossly bland while others approach greatness.  The drinks generally outshine the food and are among the prettiest and most colorful concoctions I've ever seen while often being a bit too weak on the booze for my palette.  This is a pretty large restaurant that always seems to have a crowd and I really prefer sitting at the bar to be closer to the action so I don't get lost in the horde of other customers.  This isn't a place I would hang out all the time but it certainly can be fun on occasion for a little imaginary tropical flavor.",

I got the grilled jerk chicken which wasn't jerk at all...just grilled chicken w/ a fruity glaze and some pineapple and mango underneath it.  Tasty but I could never justify paying $16 for it.  My wife got the chicken santiago which was a lot better than mine and probably what I would get if I did do dinner here again.  Its also great that they offer lighter portions so we didn't have to bring anything home in a box as usual.    The place was packed!!  I guess this is a pretty popular place?  Drinks were ok and fairly priced.  It would be a great place for happy hour if they had one.  I think doing drinks with multiple appetizers would be the way to go next time.",

We got there just after 9 and it was fairly empty. I requested to sit outside because it was 80 outside but felt nice. We were seated in the \"outside\" with an AC unit blasting on us. I get cool easily so I wasn't loving it. We ordered 2 Pina Coladas, nachos, a burger and side Salad.  The drinks were good, good flavor but took a while to come. The food was out so quickly it was amazing. The burger was decent, as my fiance said it's hard to mess up a burger. The ceaser salad was, meh, limp lettuce and way to much dressing. The nachos were disappointing. Not enough chip to topping ratio, the salsa was a little bit meh too. Overall we didn't spend much because of the happy hour and we left full. We decided we wouldn't be back unless it was just for drinks because the food wasn't that great.",

My favorite meal is from here and it's a must try, the salmon tostada. The portion is huge, the salmon is perfectly cooked, and the dressing is to die for. Another favorite is the habanero wings, you get a ton of wings since it's an appetizer and the sauce is sweet and spicy. The cocktails are great here and the happy hour deals are wonderful! The service is always great, everyone is so friendly we haven't had a bad server yet. My mom and I come at least every two weeks, sometimes once a week.",

    "text": "Great layout, music, etc; relaxing atmosphere.   I was in Vegas for a work convention (exciting, I know) and on the way to the airport, for the last couple of hours, I wanted something quick and easy... but relaxing.  My local friends wanted to meet here for Happy Hour.    I got here around 4:30 on a Monday.  I really love being able to just park and walk up in Vegas. Eating on the strip is a whole process of parking and walking through casinos... that's like a wasted 20 minutes there, another 20 back.  A place like this, nice and easy.    The layout is great.  It goes for a Caribbean/Cuban feel, especially outside, without feeling cheesy.  Nice shutters on the enclosed patio area, warm air coming in, sunny... just a very relaxed atmosphere where you really don't feel like you're in Vegas.  I felt like I was on vacation, actually, which sounds cheesy but it's True.  The restaurant was pretty open, though, but it was a weekday.    Now, the food...  Happy Hour is an amazing deal.  It's like $5-something per dish and beers and drinks are from $2-$3....!?  What... the... hell!  So good.     We were starving so we got almost one of everything; the jerk chicken, pork sliders, burger sliders, empandas, quesadilla, coconut shrimp, etc.  Everything was great.  My friends were a little hesitant about the jerk chicken because it was black, due to the rub, but it was great.   My friends had a pineapple coconut martini (great), mojito (they loved it, had real sugar cane), I had a hefeweizen.     So basically, you can't miss at Happy Hour - everything was great.  This is a small detail that I really appreciate. In the men's bathroom, they have mouthwash dispensers. It's a great touch because, let's be honest, your breath after eating isn't going to be the best so this is a great way to hit the reset button.   It was just a fun, casual experience... it really felt like we weren't in Vegas, but on vacation.",

Shrimp and lobster quesadillas can lay off all the spinach or rename it ....Jerk Chicken pasta should have been ordered without the asparagus... it gives and unwanted flavor...soups chicken tortilla and the bahamian seafood chowder needed some umph... now the firecracker shrimp adds back to the positives..all in all I was confused, was this a island themed or southwestern themed menu too many items take away from that island theme...I can Pass on a future visit...",

    "text": "I love this restaurant- so much that I had my bachelorette party there. I love the atmosphere (the decor is tropical), the food is excellent, and the caribbean music (free entertainment) adds to the overall fun feel of this restaurant. It's easy to feel good in this type of restaurant. I've only been here for dinner, but about ten times. (Twice for an e-mail member event- that was fun!) The service is really good. The location (Paradise/Flamingo) is in \"Restaurant Row.\" It's very easy to get there from the Strip, if you are just visiting. If you're coming for dinner, make a reservation, because this is a very popular restaurant. Outside seating is nice, if you can stand the heat during the summer months.    My favorite appetizer is the Coconut Shrimp. It's now the best all around in Las Vegas, since Red Lobster's version has changed. I don't like a whole lot of breading- like how they do so often at chinese restaurants. It's definitely not the case here. Also, the size of the shrimp is pretty good.    My favorite dish here is the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta. I am not usually a fan of creamy sauces, but I make the exception here. It is the perfect blend of bowtie pasta, jerk chicken (love that spice combination), mushrooms, and asparagus. It's the best thing on the menu. But that's my opinion. I've tried other things on the menu but I keep coming back to this dish.   About the prices, it's a chain restaurant, so the prices are going to be slightly higher than some restaurants out there. Frankly, I didn't think that the Planet Hollywood restaurants are anything special, but they still remain popular today for some reason. I would rather go to Hard Rock Cafe, but now, my husband doesn't think those restaurants are anything special either.          SInce I love this place, I am sure we will be back again.",

You can order in 4's or 8's! As an entree I had the Breeze Wood Grilled Chicken with a Citrus Butter sauce, Broccoli & Mashed Cinnamon Sweet Potatoes! Yummy!! The chicken was grilled perfectly! The broccoli was steamed just right and the sweet potatoes were mmm good!  I had a bite of my husband's Calypso Shrimp Linguine and the shrimp was very tender and there was just the right amount of sauce! He also had a Barbados Rum Punch and said it almost tasted like the ones we had in Barbados! It was actually made with the same rum!   We've been coming to Bahama Breeze since we lived in Orlando,  so about 15 years. Out there we would wait up to 3 hours(it was well worth the wait) on a Fri/Sat night! Was glad when they opened the one here that it was much bigger!!   We'll be back!!",

I dunno, I'm leaning towards him just being lazy. I even ordered two different ones. Both sucked and we're just syrupy tasting. Nasty nasty nasty.   The visit I'm commenting on was about a month ago.

I feel like boneless picks up way more flavor and as a result felt like this had no flavor at all. The rice and beans were ok but overall I was disappointed with my selection. It also took a long time to get drinks from the bar...like our food came out quicker than drinks did (alcoholic beverages).  Pros: great ambiance. Clean restaurant, live music, and decent pricing. My husband got shrimp scampi and said it was really good. We had a Carmel cheesecake and that was yummy. Our waiter, Joe, was awesome!  Great personality and really treated us well. Wait time wasn't long at all maybe 5 minutes but we did go on a slow Wednesday.   In a nutshell: I didn't care for my selection but I would try it again mainly because of how awesome our waiter was.",

First, I ordered an ice tea to drink Now I wear glasses, but, if I can see through a glass of ice tea, I know that it's not too strong, So after some wait, he brought me a Coke! Then after several return trips to see if we were ready to order, we did, so he could  go make someone else's life uncomfortable. He brought my companion's soup and when I asked where the appetizer was, he informed me that she ordered the soup ? No kidding AND I ordered an appetizer, but I guess that it doesn't come first at BB? Eventually, the appetized AND the entrees were delivered together? OK, make do! A manager (?) came over and asked if everything was OK, of course I like being served all 3 courses at the same time, it saves the waiter a trip. The waiter went into seclusion to pout and I had to walk up front to the bar to get a refill of the Coke. The waiter came to the table to ask if I needed a straw, NO I needed a refill! The food was good, as I remembered it being there, we ended up getting to go boxes. I did want to try a desert but, honestly, was afraid to take a chance with this guy! I  A terrible experience!",

I loved the coconut shrimp and the sauce it came with it. The beef empanadas were tasty and better the next day. I wasn't a fan of the plantains bread but the chicken was cooked to perfection. I didn't like the chicken wings. It had no flavor without the BBQ sauce. I sent it back. Lastly, I got a virgin frozen bahamarita. I enjoyed it, but I was a little annoyed they put it in a normal glass.  The staffed was really friendly and attentive. I appreciate awesome customer service.  It's in no way shape or form authentic Carribean food I enjoyed it.",

    "text": "Used to go to this place in Atlanta but was happy to find one here in Vegas since I just relocated here. I always get the firecracker shrimp and extra sauce on the side. Then I ordered the jerk chicken bow tie pasta w/asparagus and mushrooms. I prefer much more \"jerk seasoning\" and more chicken. The asparagus tips would be fine but not a fan of all stalks so I put them aside. Next time I'll just say NO asparagus. If they add more spicy seasoning that'd be great. My guest got the plate w jerk chicken black beans and plantains and greens he said it was pretty good. Regardless they've got two diff happy hours -Thur 4p-6p then again I believe 10p to close (?) 1/2 off a special list of appetizers so my shrimp would have been $5 ish and discounts like $4 well drinks and $2 off certain beers. Wish it was close by-it was @ 30 min away so it's not a convenient HH for me unfortunately unless I'm already in the area which is why we went. I'll be back whenever I'm in the vicinity. Our waitress-blond older sweet lady w/tattoos was great-very prompt regarding refilling our beverage and conversation was nice. My only issues is that we have to wait, when there's clearly a HUGE open seating area that is available, meaning there are not enough servers...which is not an excuse. Just seat people before they go to another restaurant bc you didnt hire enough ppl to cover stations. The Hawaiin Manager, female is great!",

Came here for happy hour with a girlfriend and it was both our first time here. We were seated outside, which by the way, wasn't really outside, just another room in the restaurant that had an outside vibe to it.   We ordered lots of different appetizers and drinks since it was 50% off. We had the Jamaican wings, crab stack, seared ahi and firecracker shrimp. The Jamaican wings were so crispy and juicy. It was accommodated by a bbq sauce (5/5). The seared ahi was ok. It lacked a little flavor (2/5). The firecracker shrimp was the same. It was just a fried shrimp with a spicy mayo dipping sauce (3/5). But the crab stack was heaven!!!! It was mango and avocados with crab meat and shrimp with a sweet savory sauce. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it right now!!! (5/5) it is definitely a must try!! They use REAL crab meat. YUMMMMM  Our server/bartender I forgot to get his name... but he was great! He constantly checked up on us and was the one who actually recommended that delicious crab stack. I had no problems with him whatsoever.   Good food & good service!!! A place worth trying. I will be back again for happy hour!!!",

Came in for Rumtoberfest and to check out some drink flights I had seen online.  Drink flights are my fave cause I love trying everything.  Started with the Higgla's Happy Juice a 3 cocktail flight.  It was OK so we decided to order The Rum Raid an 8 cocktail flight.  We didn't realize that it had 3 of the same flavors as our previous flight.  Most of the cocktails tasted very similar, surprisingly we only liked a few.  We finished off with a margarita flight and that was by far the best drinks of the night.    For food we ordered Jamaican Chicken Wings, Key West Nachos, Coconut Shrimp, Firecracker Shrimp and Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla.  Food was good.  Nothing amazing but a great price at half off.  Portions were large.  I was disappointed that the nachos did not have plantain chips like it said on the menu.    Service was average.  We had multiple bartenders in the few hours we were there.  None of them were very personable or friendly.",

Input error they said, so that came only shortly before our appetizers. The server asked if we wanted to put in an order for main entrees and my teen daughter literally laughed out loud. It took so long to get appetizers, can you imagine how long entrees would take! We're in Vegas...I wasn't planning on spending the entire day at Bahama Breeze. They ended up comping our food, so we only had to pay for drinks. Honestly, they should have compensated the whole meal.",

For my most recent visit, I ordered the stuffed crab shells (definitely my new favorite) and an order of beef empanadas which I ordered to take home. So, I got full off of mango lemonade, lol. Did I mention it's served in a glass and the extra is served in the mixer? When I got around to the beef empanadas with the mango chutney (breakfast), I was pleased with the amazing flavors, even as leftovers. This restaurant is a great place for happy hour. They have amazing drink & food specials.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying bahama breeze after passing it quite a few times. I saw that they have happy hour and was finally able to go with my sister and her BF.   Lots of parking and a really great environment with live music. We weren't in the main dining room, but we were in the room with the live music and beachy feel which was great. I enjoyed the atmosphere.   Our server took a while to come by, she might have been on break or something. By the time she came, we had already looked over the menu and knew what we wanted to order. Our food came out quickly after we placed our order.  Lobster and shrimp quesadilla: unfortunately it was our least favorite dish. I didn't get to taste much lobster and I felt it was lacking some flavor or spice.  Coconut shrimp: their most popular appetizer but it wasn't crispy enough for me. It was pretty good but I was hoping for a stronger coconut flavor. My sister loved this dish.   Seared ahi tuna: 5/5!!! I could eat an entire plate (or 2) but unfortunately I had to share. The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the salad went very well with it. The mango glaze wasn't over powering either.   Habanero chicken wings: we probably should have ordered the Jamaican jerk wings. While the portion was really big, we did not enjoy the wings. It was spicy but the BBQ and habanero didn't mix very well IMO.   I had been wanting a frozen bahamarita all day and it did not disappoint me. I'm pretty sensitive to alcohol and yes... I'm one of THOSE people who get super red after half a shot but I managed to finish my entire drink without getting tomato red. Drinks here seem to be watered down because I also tried my sisters classic margarita and it didn't taste like it had any alcohol in it! I loved it but she did not.   The next I come back, I'll be ordering their seared ahi tuna again and I'll be trying their empanadas",

I'm a huge fan of their coconut shrimp tacos (choice of 2 or 3). The tacos come with a generous amount of coconut shrimp and an added spice is added with their house style pico. Last night I ordered this dish with a side of their beef tomato salad. The tomatoes were tossed in a vinaigrette and topped with fresh basil. Bold fresh flavors in every bite! My boyfriend always enjoys the Jamacian jerk chicken pasta. I've never tried it but it looks delicious (if you like jerk chicken). Bowtie pasta is tossed with asparagus, mushrooms and of course chicken. This is another dish you have the choice between large or small. We came late and took advantage of their happy hour. We don't drink but they offer half off, full size appetizers. If you love quesadillas you have to try theirs! Cheesy, bold flavors and deliciousness!! Our server last night was Fred. He was so nice and very attentive. Our drinks were never empty and our table was always manicured. He was extremely friendly but allowed us to enjoy our meal without being overbearing. Thank you Fred! I really appreciated your service last night.",

Fast forward several years (4 yrs) some friends of ours said BB had been revamped and it was worth it to give it another shot. So a few months ago we tried it again and felt that it wasn't much better. Then tonight we decided to give it another try and we took our kids and we're beyond disappointed with everything we ordered. We ordered an appetizer and 3 entrees. Both my husband and I ordered the Key West fish tacos which were a comical. They barely contained any fish let alone any filling, the tortillas were gross store bought flour tortillas that were soggy by the time we got them. Our kids sliders weren't anything great. In the end, we left saying we'd never go back. We gave it a few tries and it's not worth the drive nor money.",

It had 4 stars so I went in. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and seafood clam chowder. I have to say I was not impressed with either. The sandwich was made with deli sliced ham and deli sliced pork. Not what I expected! That alone gives the sandwich a cheap quality. They need to use real pork from the smoker or rosted. Same thing with the ham. The chowder was a little watery and lacked a bit more flavor. It also needs to have bigger chunks in it. The service was pretty good. It's nice and cool inside. Need to beat the heat! I like the ambiance in this place. I'll be back to try other food items. I want to give it a fair chance. 2 stars for now. More to come stay tuned. I'm here for the next two weeks.",

The food was delicious! We ordered the beef empanadas and omg!! Bomb! A must try! Best part the appetizers and  select alcoholic drinks were half off! Score! We got the frozen margarita. Can't remember the exact name but it was colorful. So pretty and delicious! Our dinner came and my husband got the jerk chicken pasta. It wasn't too spicy had a kick and tasted yummy. I ordered the coconut shrimp with rice and garlic mashed potatoes. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and really good as was the rice. The potatoes were ok not the best. Order something else instead of the potatoes. Overall had a great experience with great service and delicious food. Highly recommend! Wish they had one in California.",

    "text": "Haven't really been to Bahama Breeze in years....but thanks to a Red Lobster gift card (both restaurants belong to Darden), and a Valentine's date for some KISS Mini Golf (review on that later), we were hungry!  Got to say, restaurant is still not bad for a Caribbean-themed chain.  Place was hoppin'!  Very, very busy.  Folks must like their congo music, eh?  Breezy.  Luckily even with no reservations our wait time for a table was less than five minutes.  Like the place - open, airy, noisy, and boy do I love the smell of Jerk chicken on the grills.  I'm really hoping that it's cooked on an open charcoal flame, but I'm pretty sure it's probably not.  Can't have everything I suppose.  After getting seated and giving our drink order (Bahama Breeze using bottles of Republic of Tea - Ginger Peach is tasty but a tad pricy) we were ready to view the menu.  It really is a bit of a mix, some Jamaican, some Caribbean, some American.  Fortunately a lot of it sounded tasty.  Wifey couldn't decide so she settled on the Island Hopper ($19.99) - appetizer sampler platter of sorts that included their signature Jamaican chicken wings, crispy coconut shrimp, onion rings, and conch fritters.  It came with sauce sides of jerk BBQ sauce, citrus mustard, and a roasted pineapple chutney.  For the most part she enjoyed it.  The Jamaican chicken wings were a bit smaller than she remembered but they were still very tasty with a peppery kick.  Coconut shrimp were indeed crispy, but light, with good hints of sweet when dipped in the pineapple chutney.  Conch fritters were only OK, a bit forgetful because they tasted more of a hush puppy with very little conch inside.  And the onion rings, well they were just onion rings.  I ended up getting the Cuban Sandwich ($10.99) and while I did like it, I should have read the menu better.  Why does Bahama Breeze put lettuce & tomato in a Cuban sandwich??  And salami???  Very, very strange.  Just do it like the Cubans guys - marinated roasted pork, good ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard between buttered Cuban bread then smooshed in a plancha till golden brown.  Simple!  Thank you Jon Favreau of Iron Man and Chef fame!  I think I would have enjoyed this sandwich a lot more without the extra fluff, but did applaud the effort of Bahama Breeze trying to make the sandwich their own.  Next time I would just order it with no lettuce & tomato, or just put it on the side.  Overall a good experience at Bahama Breeze, the atmosphere was inviting, and the service was stellar without being pretentious.  The food could use some tweaking but that's par for the course.  If this place wasn't so far from where we live I would be likely to check out their menu further or at least come down for their hoppin' Happy Hour.  Jamaican me crazy!",

Not to greasy and the coconut flakes gave it a nice flavor. I got the avocado and crab salad. Very very good. I ate every single bite! No run for dessert, but my two drinks were sweet enough. They were a specialty drink, kinda like a pina colada but without being frozen, very good! I definately will come back!",

    "text": "We went here for a birthday party for a co-worker of a friend of mine.  It was not my first choice to go to..honestly I'd only seen this place in passing on my way to the airport.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, nice big building on the corner of Paradise and Flamingo on the Northwest side.  Walking in, however, you feel transported to another place with the Caribbean theme of the restaurant and bar.  However, like a friend has told me, you can't necessarily paint something to make it what it ain't.  The food here is expensive for what you get.  We ordered quite a bit of food for the party: Spinach Dip and Island Chips, Island Onion Rings, West Indies Patties, and Creole Baked Goat Cheese to start.  None of these, to me, were particularly good.  The Spinach Dip was not even touched as my friend ordered it and then tried to pass it along to everyone else because she hated it.  The entree's were a little better: Cuban Sandwich and Margarita Chicken.  However for the $10 and $15 plates of food, I've had much better.  The service was slow for a slow Wednesday early evening dinner.  It was nice that we were able to sit in the atrium outside that was nicely cooled.  All in all, this seems like a poorly done chain restaurant based on a Caribbean theme.  My search shall continue (though how hard I look is yet to be determined).",

    "text": "I wanted to find a location for the \"meet & greet\" on the first night of our destination wedding weekend, and I was totally disheartened by the pricing of any and all on-Strip locations. While driving around, the BFF and I happened to see Bahama Breeze. I know, I know, it's a chain -- but it has a fun, vacation-y appeal, so we called from the car to ask about group events.  Options from the low $20s per person? Cash bar available? Sign us up! We swung in for lunch to try as many menu items as we possibly could. The tostones and coconut shrimp both made for very tasty appetizers, although the tostones were a little dry -- but once you add all the cheese and toppings, yuuuuuum-ola. We both agreed our entrees were good, although now I can't remember what Jess got (some sort of chicken sandwich?). I tried the tilapia and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was, and it came with cinnamon sweet potatoes! We even had dessert, fantastic dulce de leche cheesecake (with an excellent graham cracker crust).  I will readily admit that I would probably only normally give BB more like 3 stars; however, this location was so upbeat and fun, the staff members were all so friendly and helpful, the drinks were so cheap... that I'm bumping it up. AND, it looks like it will be the perfect place to host a meet & greet, so if you're looking for a group event place, I'd definitely consider it!  P.S. One other reviewer mentioned the bathrooms, and I will ditto that. They're beautiful. Weird, I know.",

So did this one upon first inspection, but a few things stood out.  First, our waiter was top notch. Friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and even engaged us as we asked about how the local dining businesses were faring in the current economic state. He was actually a PT waiter at another restaurant, and he helped us pick our dishes.  The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the jerk chicken bowtie pasta, which was slightly spicy but in a good way.  Although I might not go actively searching for this place next time I am in Vegas, I would recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably priced, tasty meal.",

    "text": "I would like to formally thank Bahama Breeze and their staff for their sincere efforts towards RUINING my family reunion dinner on Saturday, July 23, 2011.  God Bless my mother and my aunts for their hard work in putting this thing on and for keeping everyone else patient while this disaster was taking place.  This was by far the worst6 display of service I have ever seen and several formal letters are being sent to their corporate office as I write this.    My family had made arrangements with their business office to hold our reunion here for a buffet-style dinner.  We do not live in Las Vegas (none of us do) so we did everything via fax and phone.  We have been to this location on several occasions over the years, so we are familiar with the food and always had really good service here.  I also always enjoyed the food, so we thought this would be the perfect place to host our family reunion dinner.  Anyway, so the contract we made was for three main entrees (seafood paella, baby back ribs and Jamaican grilled chicken) , three side dishes (yellow rice, green beans, creamed sweet potatoes) and their signature green salad.  This was all to be served buffet-style with unlimited choice of soft drinks, tea/coffee and iced tea. The price negotiated was $35 per person.  We brought in our own cakes for dessert which they kept in the back refrigerated for us.  This was a group of approximately 31 people.  Kids' menu items were to be paid for separately as well as cocktails, beer and wine. Each table would get their own bill for those things separately (and for anything else you want on the regular menu).  From the beginning, service problems began.  There were two servers who primarily came in our area.  Over the course of the evening, we had to literally chase these people down for drinks and just basic service.  It was horrible.  I noticed that the buffet serving containers were quite small for the amount of people in party and they emptied very quickly.  Nobody was there to replace to food.  People sat with food while others had to wait a long time before being able to get food.  The salad bowl probably could serve about 6 to 8 people, so when that emptied (no other food was out or available at this point), people just sat their for a good 20 minutes before they brought out more.  This was the ongoing theme of the night.  Need a refill on that ice tea? Be prepare to never get it unless you run around trying to find the waiter to get some.  Nobody was attending to our party.  Nobody was busing the plates so we literally had pile them in the middle table.  Kids' orders were not brought out in a timely manner so the kids were eating like an hour into dinner service.  Remember the tea and coffee? None was offered to anyone and we paid for it!  And to top off , when the staff did make an appearance, they had really nasty attitudes about it.  No apologies.  So where was the manager in all this? Certainly not rolling up his sleeves trying to help his clearly overwhelmed waitstaff.  He was somewhere else, making excuses that there were other big parties going on.  NOT OUR PROBLEM.    Look, this was clearly an understaffed event and the lack of attention to ANY sort of detail shows that, but come on! It was just blatantly bad.  Poor attitude and unapologetic staff is just a reflection of the management's nonchalance for literally pissing all over this party.  We had babies crying from hunger, we had piled up dirty plates, plenty of empty glasses and annoyed family members.  Thank goodness we are good spirited people, kept the party going and did our raffles and announcements and passed out cake as planned. We tried not to let our experience at Bahama Breeze ruin our getting to catch up with each other and have fun, but damn! Work with us here! We could have just gone to a buffet at one of the casinos for this and we probably should have.   Oh and I haven't even gotten to how salty the food was!  The paella was nearly inedible even though they did not skimp on seafood, does it matter if they pour a whole container of salt in it?  Dry chicken, hard to cut with my knife.  However, the ribs were decent as were the green beans and sweet potatoes..but wait..something was missing.  Mom did not realize this until after but they forgot our yellow rice.  We have a few people in our party who are allergic to seafood so the paella was out, hence the reason for the yellow rice side.  I guess everything else was so bad we forgot about the missing side. Anyway, my mom called their business office and got it refunded.  Either way, I could think of sooo many other places to host a dinner like this that would have gone so much smoother.  They really should be ashamed for doing such a sloppy-ass job.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place.  It had a great atmosphere and a good vibe.  We went here because it had a claim that it was \"Gluten Free.\" Something I have to look for because of my wheat allergy so I was excited.  They didn't have a special GF menu which is not a big deal to me because typically the waiter will just fill me in or make his recommendations.  This waiter didn't know much about what foods or sauces had flour.  He didn't really have any enthusiasm to find out and come back and make some recommendations. So I had to McGyver my own meal which typically means I have to eliminate the sauces. I tip very well when waiters really know the foods and can make recommendations or atleast have the eagerness to find out for me. I don't typically eat out and this was going to be a real treat for me.  I ordered scallops in butter sauce and the scallops were burnt and then raw in the middle. When I sent them back, they replaced only the one I ate half of.  I asked for a dinner salad instead and they gave it to me with croutons.  He took it back and picked off the croutons as crumbles were still there. What part of \"I can't eat flour don't you understand?\"    I sent back the salad and refused to eat as I swore someone would have spit in my food by now.  And let me tell you, I'm a very passive person when it comes to any problems with my food.  So I wasn't mad or anything and I didn't give the waiter any attitude. By the way, the waiter never apologized for any inconvenience or was concerned.  There was a huge two parties going on and every staff member kept coming in and out the patio doors fussying over the parties and most people seated were ignored and were very openly upset about the service by stopping random staff members for drink refills and to check on their food.  I was with two other people who swore it tasted nice but I don't know if they were just being polite as literally \"utter chaos\" was going on around us and we waited 45 minutes for our table when we called in advance for a reservation.  I was treating my friends so I was shocked that I was given a \"$10.00 charge\" for food that was returned!  I hadn't eaten anything sat and drank myself silly over the ice tea and left more hungry than I came in.  There was absolutely no apology anywhere or from anyone and I couldn't believe the waiter was serious about this charge. So I didn't tip him.  Probably the first time in a really really long time that I haven't tipped a waiter.  Still feeling a bit guilty over it but it was a very bad experience and it wasn't me that night it was everyone else around us too.",

Our server was fantastic - bright and bubbly, recommended a handful of items. It took us about 20+ minutes to get ready and order, yet she checked on us ever 5 minutes to answer questions.  I personally got the Jerk Chicken, with cinnamon sweet potatoes, green beans and a mango pineapple salsa. I didn't taste much of the jerk seasonings - but then again, the menu DID say \"mild\". The sweet potatoes very very sweet, but it balanced with the salsa and chicken.  One of my co-worker's dish was forgotten by the food runner, so our server came by and said the manager comped the dish and a hot plate would be coming right up. Good service!",

    "text": "Every time that I've come get I have never been disappointed. For all those looking for a restaurant that has a great atmosphere, excellent service and bomb food, you have to try this place.  Happy hour at this place is worth the money!!! But when its not happy hour, its still worth coming to no matter what. Let me recommend a few things on the menu:  Habanero Wings- OH MAN, I don't eat a lot of spicy food but this one is so delicious! It has a mix of a sour cream and pico de gallo dipping sauce. All I can say is all the flavors is like a party in your mouth! I was cleaning up the bone and I never do that lol! The blend is perfect! This is a MUST ORDER when coming here!   Jerk Chicken- Love the seasoning on this. I know they marinade it overnight and put it in the frier to give it a lil crunch. Lemme tell you this, they know how to season this to perfection. Love the sauce to add too, its a touch of sweetness. The combination together is like heaven  Beef Empanadas- Great starter, ALWAYS good to order before the food is coming, they use the same sauce for the habanero wings. Still, the pairing is always perfect when it comes to their sauces and food.  Calypso Shrimp Linguine- All the flavors pop in this dish. My 3 yr old son who is a picky eater will share this with me. The portion size is enough to feed me, my 3 yr old and my 8 yr old. This is a popular dish at this place, I've ordered this numerous times coming here.   Jerk Chicken Pasta- YUM!!! it may not look as appetizing when you see the plate but DANG this one is a must order also. My husband would order this when we would come here until he discovered the....  Chicken Breast with Cilantro Crema- you have to eat each bite with the chicken, mash potatoes and the sauce. You will be craving this.  For Dessert: Order the Banana But Bread Supreme- you will not be disappointed!!!!!   Can't go wrong with this place, you will never leave disappointed. The ONLY thing I don't like is that every time we arrive, we are always greeted by a homeless person asking for some money. Seriously EVERY SINGLE visit. Other than that, I have no complaints!",

However when we decided to go there for my wife's birthday we were extremely disappointed. I ordered Jerk Chicken. I ate about half of the chicken when I realized it was getting difficult to pull the meat from the bone. This generally means chicken is undercooked. When I showed our server he called over the manager who insisted she have it remade for us. I told her I didn't really want a remake. So I opted for it to go. I was really disappointed when I told them it was my wife's birthday and ordered Key Lime pie expecting they would make her feel important with some sort of Birthday thing. But what we got was a waiter who said \" pretend I sang for you and then you blew out a birthday candle then walked away.  I will never go back to Bahama Breeze nor do I recommend them to anyone else. I can see now why they were not busy near the strip on Friday night. Diners Beware!!!",

I got the ultimate pina colada and she got the painkiller. All in all good but could maybe use a splash of rum to bring it all together. She likes spinach dip so we got that to start. Very creamy, hot and great. Like I said, we weren't really hungry and we shared the lobster Mac and cheese dish. Absolutely amazing. I've been in the restaurant industry for 10 years and it's hard to find a great spot without picking at everything but this was the exception. Well balanced flavors that can make you come back for more. We will be sure to keep coming back and bring more people with us.",

I was able to try my friends chicken breast and I liked the mango salsa that came with it.  So far we have:  Appetizers:  Onion Rings (3/5). Entrees:  Jerk Chicken Pasta (3/5) and Grilled Chicken Breast (4/5).    But the best was yet to come!  I ordered a chocolate mousse dessert, the chocolate island.  It was made with a perfectly baked brownie!  Taadaa... Dessert:  Chocolate Island.(6/5).   Service was alright, the restaurant was busy and the fan above our table wasn't working.  -.-  I didn't really feel the Bahama vibe but it could also be because I didn't order anything that that could be found outside Bahama Breeze.

We started with drinks & appetizers:  Rumrunner for the wife, a mojito for me, with coconut shrimp and conch fritters.  Rumrunner was delicious, but the mojito was not tasty and not well executed (mint wasn't muddled, lime wedges were un-squeezed and rock-hard, and it had crushed ice instead of cubes).  Shrimp and conches were both delicious, but they had the same sauce, which is a very minor criticism.  We had our minds on paella, which we ordered, and after all the fried stuff, we wanted something vegetable-y, which was not on the menu (unless you count salads, which we were not in the mood for).  On inquiring we were informed that there were broccoli, green beans, and asparagus available, of which we ordered the first two.  To our surprise and delight, the vegetables were nicely cooked and delicious.  The paella was awesome, especially considering they did not skimp on the seafood.  My wife didn't like the style of rice, but I thought it was appropriate.  It was also too much for us, and we ended up taking it home.  Since I'm writing this the day after our visit and I just had a fairly large portion of paella leftovers, I can report that it was maybe even better the next day.    Back to our visit, we were too full for dessert, so I just ordered an Irish coffee, which even after I verified that they would make it the proper way (coffee, Irish whiskey, and whipped cream), the waiter came back with this drink that he said had Kahlua in it, which I summarily sent back whence it came, which I felt they could have been a little more apologetic about.  The real drink, when it came back, kind of had an aftertaste like bottom-shelf spirits.   The ambiance was nice.  There was a musician playing tropical-themed music, which we quite enjoyed.  The service was fairly good but not superb; no complaints.",

We plan where we are going to stay, club and when we are going to eat at Bahama Breeze.  Let's start with the Cons.... there isn't a location in Southern California.  Then again, id probably spend my rent money eating there all the time.    The Service: Is always wonderful. Haven't had a bad experience yet.  The staff is always helpful and pleasant.  So cheers to them!  The Atmosphere: Wonderful!  For someone who has been to the \"islands\" this place is a good representation.  From the ceiling fans to the music being played.  Not loud, but mellow music.  Helps the food go down better... screw the sugar.  The Food:  OMG! Even if everything else was horrible the Food is so good you'd ignore it.  Jerk Chicken- my mouth is watering just thinking of them.  They have the perfect amount of jerk flavoring and are fried or baked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.  We made a mistake of sharing an order. Bad idea.  These are too good to share.  Beef Patties- Yummy! If flavor and good food aren't you thing... steer clear of this option. Truly a mouth satisfying appetizer.  Seafood Paella-So I have had Paella at a number of locations and this is one of the best.  The whole dish is a burst of happiness in your mouth.  I've had this 2 of the last 3 times I went here.  Everything else just doesn't seem to catch my eye.....  Always too full for dessert..... maybe next time.",

The waiter even added a little hand drawn picture of a sailing boat on top of my to go box which was kind of neat. My hubbie and I had the linguine for lunch the next day. I added green onions, sake and garlic to it and it was delicious! Our drinks were great too. Its not a surprise that this place was packed for a tuesday night. The only downside was the garlic bread.

I guess the food is just bland enough to appeal to the masses, and it's just cheesy enough to be \"fun\" (read Tchotchke's in Office Space). From the music, to the decor, to the food, this place is just packed with epic fail. I wanted to shoe the bargain basement Jimmy Buffet square in the nuts, not that I enjoy the real one by any stretch of the imagination.  We had the calamari appetizer, thinking it was a safe bet, and it was astonishingly rubbery. I mean, there's rubbery calamari, then there's this; it's like the difference between vulcanized rubber and the stuff they use in rubber bands. I ordered the seafood paella, and the waiter remarked that it was his favorite dish and it was just fantastic. The guy's nuts. There couldn't have been more wrong with it, save for the fish showing up raw (it was overcooked instead). Absolutely no flavor. They must not put any salt in the pot when they cook the rice, because I don't think there's any other way to make rice this unexciting. I suspect the origin of its yellow-orange hue didn't come from saffron, either. Don't remember what my fiance ordered, and neither does she, but we both remember it sucked. Bland, unexciting, chain-wide recipes aside, this kitchen had some serious issues seasoning their food properly.  All that, a beer, and a margarita for $53. What a gyp.",

For dinner, I ate the lobster and shrimp pasta, without mushrooms, which had very little sauce, but was better than the one at Red Lobster. Our waiter was hilarious and also gave the birthday girl a long sugar cane, yes, sugar cane which was talked about for a good minute. My drink also came with a sugar cane inside of it, the Lemon Breeze, which I added strawberries too. Overall, the place was chill and the food was good, but not great.

The mango salsa served with it was also tasty (I usually don't like mango salsa)  Chicken and steak skewers were ok, but there was nothing very Bahamian about them - served with grilled peppers and mushrooms. The rice/beans served beneath the skewers were dry.  Our server was a really nice guy. He recommended my drink, but I didn't have the heart to complain about it.  It's a chain restaurant, meaning not truly ethnic. Can someone recommend a sweet hole-in-the-wall?",

    "text": "I really had very high expectations for this place when I first found out we were attending a wedding reception dinner here. I have had great authentic food on the islands so I was excited about Bahama Breeze ( island grille ). Well I would like to say it is more like an American breeze with a Bahama inspiration. But after getting over the fact there is really no authentic food here this place is pretty good. We had a party of around 30 and were seated privately in a covered patio section of restaurant. This place is huge, nice and spacious. Seemed like everyone really enjoyed their drinks, I had the Bahamarita and it was very good. Ok so menu items we tried were beef empanadas: their version is good and the sauces that came with were very good. Coconut shrimp: I have had better but it was good, the sauce to dip was the winner. BBQ ribs: very good like rib joint good, Seafood and jerk pasta I was told was excellent, plenty of shrimp and lobster. The portions here are pretty big too, most guests had to go bags. I found out after the fact from a local that the one authentic item they had was conch fritters, man one of my favorites so can't wait to try them.  Our great, very patient, and very nice waitress Christine informed us about their happy hour, so we will be back since we visit Vegas frequently.",

A friend and I went there for lunch, and I had a memorable and fabulous meal.  In fact, there was so much food, I had three fabulous meals, and everything was almost as good as leftovers the next two days.  We started out with a virgin cocktail combining layers of slushy kiwi, mango, strawberry and margarita flavors, followed by an excellent house salad with a tasty citrus vinegarette house dressing.  The Shrimp and Lobster Linguine with mushrooms in a cream and brandy sauce was mouth-wateringly delicious. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse on a brownie base covered with whipped cream, toasted almond slices, chocolate sauce and Creme Anglaise.  I'd go back just to have that again.  It was a little pricey for lunch, but would be reasonable for dinner.  Our server, Tim, went out of his way to be friendly and helpful.  We had our choice of indoor or outdoor dining.  It was a delightful experience in all aspects.",

There was a guitarist playing some light guitar to some background islander music.  The service was excellent.  All our drinks were quick. The waiter made some good recommendations which we accepted, and we we're glad we did.  He was also personable.  He stayed and chatted for a bit, and we didn't feel rushed at all.   They recently changed up their menu to include rice bowls.  And boy, the Carnitas bowl is pretty amazing.  I will be ordering that often;  It's a new regular dish for me.   The reason this place hasn't earned 5 starts, is because their key lime pie leaves a lot to be desired (both my wife and I agree on this).  This should be a staple of a dessert for an islander themed restaurant, and it is a main dish the staff suggest for a dish.",

    "text": "I went here Monday night with girlfriend's Cuban family with high expectations because someone recommended it to us. Exterior was very fancy, and beachy. The restaurant is bigger than I thought with many sections.   I scrolled through Yelp to search for references of what to order. My family end up ordered Cheese Curds (cheese stuffed fried yucca) Jamaican Jerky Chicken, Seafood Paellas, a stack of Short Ribs BBQ, Cheddar Burger and fries sweet plantain. We loved the Cheese Curds. They were crunchy, cheese oozed delicious. We ended up with two orders of that. The Jamaican Jerky Chicken was delicious, the portion was huge! Half a chicken grilled with special sauce and yellow rice with fried sweet plantains. The plantains were thick cut and fried to perfection. We Cubans loved it. The Seafood Paellas were not that great. The consistency wasn't really True Paella but the flavor was there. The seafood wasn't as fresh, mussels slightly overcooked, though fish was flaky and cooked well. Paellas weren't impressive, average, but portion was also very big! Each can easily feed two people. My sister-in-law's burger was good (you can't go wrong with burger they should all taste how they should taste). My BBQ ribs were ok, again, they tasted just like how should taste. Sweet and smokey. There wasn't any special twist or spin added onto it.   Overall the experience was meh. With the bill $120 in total, we expected more. It was filling but wasn't satisfying. I heard good things about it, but maybe we ordered the wrong things because everything was just ok.",

I ordered the Caribbean chowder and the pineapple coconut martini. I also sampled a friend's cheeseballs which were excellent. Our server was very accommodating to our group, we had a party of 7 but each person arrived at different times between 730pm and 10pm. Our server did an excellent job of keeping track of our orders and the separate billings. We really appreciated that. The price of the food and drink is reasonable, I noticed that the menu has changed since the 5 years that I was last there. They have a lot more options and they are keeping up with changing tastes. We will return especially for happy hour",

Also, prices are very cheap for the area, and many office workers from walking distance go since there is a discount for Howard Hughes buildings employees.

Happy hour deals are great. We came in at 5 and the restaurant wasn't so busy so we got seated right away. Our waitress took our orders and was very enthusiastic. The only thing was that she didn't commit to her promises. When she asked if we wanted lemon with our water, she did not provide the lemon. And many times she visited our table of empty cups, she did not quickly respond to refill them. Other than that, food and drinks were bomb and I also really like the set up of the restaurant.

Decent amount of lobster but a crapload of shrimp! Every bite had shrimp and that was well worth the 20 dollars! The sauce had the right amount of creaminess to it which was a plus!

There was live music playing, a bar in the deck area, and another deck for larger reservations/parties.  I was impressed on the decor already.  I'm a sucker for restaurants that are interesting to look at, sometimes I go with not so interesting people to eat. hehehe  Anyhooo...as soon as we sat, we were asked about drinks.  I ordered a mojito, but I should have gotten the Bahama Mama margarita...It looked dramatic as it tasted. DAMMIT!!! But nevertheless, my mojito was still delicious!!!  Apetizers:  Coconut shrimp....HOT AS HELL (temp wise) which meant it was freshly cooked!!! HMMMM to die for....  My plate:  Chicken Kabobs!!!  OH my god it was the best kabobs ever.  Chicken was cooked with red and green bell peppers, whole mushrooms, and red onions.  The kabobs were served over \"island rice\".    SO GOOOD!!

The restaurant is fabulously decorated in a tropical island theme and overall is a good place to go and avoid the chaos of The Strip.    Whether you sit outside or on the patio, you will get the feel of the islands. Although the food is good, it can get a bit pricey for what it is. I had the Jamaican grilled chicken and it was $18. Tasty but $18 is a bit steep. My wife had a sandwhich for around $12.  The signature Mojito, \"Mojito Cubano\"  was overly fufu.  They pack the drink with ice and make it like a slushy.  I asked for my second with significantly less ice and it still had too much.    Given the ambiance and good food, I have given 4 stars.  I look forward to going back.",

    "text": "I was there a few months ago but thought people should know if my experience...A few people in my life know I am allergic to seafood and I have to be careful where I eat and drink. However, I sometimes take chances when there is something I have a craving for. One recent night, I went to Bahama Breeze (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bahamabreeze.com&s=b3368c928d7e7754879f74a0919845f979431a0e84de94dae4cb9af84ab16be2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bahamabreeze.com</a>) because I wanted their West Indies Patties. The friend I was dining with can't eat spicy food so she asked our waiter Jay for a sample of their jerk sauce  but Jay didn't know  how spicy the sauce was so he went and got a sample for her and the chef Dan Strohecker came with him. Since the chef was at the table I figured I would ask if they use the same oil to cook everything. Dan said he couldn't guarantee that they didn't but especially when a rush comes on. He graciously offered to cook the patties in new oil for me in a skillet. I was floored because that has NEVER happened in any restaurant I have ever eaten at. He said they will do anything within reason to ensure their guest enjoy themselves and any allergy issues are addressed.  I thanked him and he went and got started on my patties. Jay brought them to the table and a short time later Dan came back and asked me how they were and he looked down and laughed cuz the plate was empty. He said there's my answer! He said he had never cooked them that way before and didn't know if they would turn out light and crunchy like they do when fried in the deep fryer. I told him not only were they light but the crunch was unbelieveable. Not too hard and not to soft. Just perfect! I thanked him again and told him I would tell all my friends and blog about it. Bahama Breeze is one of the more successful restaurants in Las Vegas and now I know why! The food is exceptional but the service and attention to customers is phenomenal! Beyond anything I have ever experienced before. They are better than 5 star in my book. When you are there, tell Dan what a wonderful chef he is and request Jay as your waiter. You won't be disappointed at all!",

Thank goodness I picked Bahama Breeze! I tried to make a reservation a week or so in advance and was told to just call the morning of. I was a little skeptical but thought, ok fine, let's see. Called the morning of and got a reservation, no problem at all. Had to wait about 20 minutes once we got there for the table to be ready, and had to have them add more seats 3 times, for some reason they kept counting wrong. But all the staff was very sweet. Had two servers, one was named \"Red\", both were AWESOME! Took a while to get drinks out, but with 18 people that can be expected. My hubs and I had some Mojitos, the avocado crab stack, coconut shrimp, fish tacos and side salad with fruit vinaigrette. Everything was DELISH! I mean like super, awesome, very, very good!!!!!! They also let us each have separate checks which made paying SO much easier! Thank you Bahama Breeze for making my birthday dinner amazing! All 18 people loved their food and drinks, and that's not an easy task!",

It truly reminds me of a meal in the Bahamas. The only thing missing were the geckos on the walls.   Food is great, service is ok. Decor is perfect.  and yes.....  I know it is a chain.  I typically shun chains and like all chains it will probably go down the big spiral.  But for now, I like it!",

When the food came out I started with my soup, and then  went to take a bite of the tacos and realized the tortillas were flour. I quickly empty the content of tacos I to my soup bowl right when Kurt was walking by to ask how our food was - I told him that the tortillas were still flour and he said \" let me take them out of your way ' wow no attempt at service recovery ,no offer to bring out corn tortillas and no apology! We are locals who would have been back as This was our first visit and based on this experience it will be our last - please teach your team how to make things up of they make a mistake - everyone understands that things happen but staff need to know how to make it right when they screw up",

We ordered the jerk chicken wings and coconut shrimp, we made it for happy hour so that was a great deal. The chicken wings were delicious, the seasoning was def jerk and not over powering and the sauce was really good. The coconut shrimp were tender, not over cooked and juicy. The sauce on that, although they say it's the sauce that sets it apart, I've actually had that sauce somewhere in Alaska with coconut shrimp- but still very good. I tried ordering the Calypso Shrimp Linguini but the server instead recommended I get the Shrimp and Lobster Linguini instead due to the base of the sauce being oil vs. cream. I like that he suggested something just on that basis, I like servers that are knowledgeable about their own food. My food came with a generous helping of seafood, I couldn't even finish it. My husband got the Lobster Mac n Cheese, which he didn't find special. I took their Key Lime Pie home. It was pretty good, tangy and not too sweet and the crust was really good. Overall environment was chill and can be used for a romantic evening or just to hang out with friends. I love that they play island music - the music of my people, you would think it was just Jamaican, nope there's Jamaican, Hawaiian and Samoan artists on the cuts. I'll be back with friends!",

We planned a Secret Santa gift exchange and planned to come here. I called ahead of time to see if they can help us remain anonymous with our gifts. They allowed us to bring in our gifts and keep them at the front desk. When the time came, they wheeled all the gifts and handed them out to who they were supposed to go to. So awesome. They made our party fun.   One lady who works there, I want to say her name is Denise, but I could be wrong. She is great! Every time we're there, she's there and comes to say hi, When we met her, we had found out our friend was moving overseas, so we were upset. Then when we came back for her going away, she was there too and stopped by. She even remembered the night we all had tears in out eyes.   I love the food here! The firecracker shrimp and jerk shrimp are my favorite. I like my food with a little kick and these deliver. Firecracker shrimp comes with a really good dipping sauce, while the jerk shrimp comes with Cuban bread. Also love their drinks! I get the Frozen Bahamarita. I recently tried the specialty rum drink they had, and got a souvenir glass.   For my birthday, I had planned on coming here for lunch after some activities. After telling my mom, she later told me that they were going to take me there for dinner! lol they know where to take me, that;s for sure.   Some nights they have live music, but there are always different parties going on.I really enjoy coming here because the food is good, staff are friendly and I always have a great time coming here.",

The crispy onion rings have a panko-coconut breading that's fried to a golden-brown. The coconut flavor is really subtle, but you can't go wrong with this classic appetizer.  The lobster & shrimp quesadilla was pretty amazing. Who would've ever thought that cheese and shellfish would be a perfect match? They came with pico de gallo and sour cream on the side, which go perfect with these little triangles of cheesy goodness. The lobster seemed a little sparing, but the shrimp was definitely there.  The Jamaican chicken wings had the perfect marinade to it. The jerk spices added a unique zing to the wings that blast your tastebuds with rich flavor! The spiciness factor isn't too hot. It won't burn your tongue, but it definitely has a noticeable kick.   I'll be back to try their entrees, but their appetizers are really something special. Any place that has amazing deals for their happy hour is worth it to me!",

Conch fritters were crispy a flavorful. Caesar salad with their house vinaigrette- citrus flavor was fresh and light. And the paella. THE PAELLA!!! To die for! Amazing flavor with enough spices to keep things lively but not too much so. The pineapple crene brulee was unique - almost more of a pineapple pudding with the sugar glazed topping. Definitely worth trying. All in all, 2 thumbs WAY up.",

    "text": "We decided on Bahama Breeze after our return from San Diego California. Hubby went down to pick up some surfboards. We were hungry and indecisive on where to eat. Anyways, Bahama Breeze is located just east of Tuscany Suites & Casino.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a very nice young lady. She offered us a booth/ table which really threw me off. When I saw it I was like Oh okay. Auntie took the booth side. Hubby & I took the table side. Our server told us about the drink specials. Bahama MaMa's $3. Since I couldn't drink. I talked Auntie into having one for me. Guess what, she ended up having 2...Lol.  Our order, Delicious Grilled Salmon & Mixed Greens with corn and black beans, avocado and drizzled with island vinaigrette. Aunt Marilyn Loved it. Was enough to have for lunch the next day.  Hubby ordered the Seafood Paella. A Caribbean classic with sauteed scallops shrimp, fish, mussels, chicken, and chorizo sausage with yellow rice. I could tell it was a little spicy. John was wiping his nose.  I had the mouthwatering Grilled Chicken Breast with broccoli that was cooked just right. The broccoli wasn't too mushy nor too hard. Plus Plus, it actually came with cheese sauce. Unfortunately, I was so full that I didn't try the asparagus.  The Two dived head 1st into the Coconut Grande. A coconut lovers dream. Warm coconut cake topped with coconut-pineapple ice cream, fresh pineapple and toasted coconut. Served in a fresh coconut.  Auntie thought this was a great place to dine and to come back to again.",

I had the jerk chicken pasta as my entree and it was huge! The food was so delicious I couldn't resist but finish it all. It is on the pricier side of a sit down restaurant.

I ordered the skillet jerk shrimp which was delicious. It comes with warm Cuban bread to dip into the jerk sauce which was soo yummy. It's very filling and I should have just ordered that. I also had the fish tacos. A waste of my money. The fish was cold and had absolutely no flavor at all. It was so bad, I didn't even finish it. It came with a tomato salad that was good, but it's very hard to mess up tomatoes. My friend ordered the Jamaican wings that she said was very good. I also had a coconut mojito that was just ok. The lemonade which is usually very good was way too sweet this time. Everyone has a bad day once in a while so I will definitely come again and see if things are better on my next visit to Vegas",

    "text": "Let me just say it was not a Breeze to get out of this restaurant earlier today. Family came into town this weekend and they wanted to enjoy something off the strip and new to them. We decided on Bahama Breeze because we had a good experience with food and service before.  The Inside of this restaurant gave them an Islands Burgers kind of vibe so they were liking it so far. Once we were seated (less than 2 minutes) we had a while to look over the menu so by the time our waiters came by we put in our drink and food orders. Drinks came out and they were delicious, I got the Mystic Margarita and it was wonderful. Waiters had to be reminded that they forgot one drink but it was a big table so it was forgivable.  After the waiters were asked how much longer the food was going to take and a good 40ish minutes, the food had arrived! Everything was looking great until there was a hair found in one of the burgers. YUCK. The waiters took it back and we really didn't have time to wait for another 40 minutes, the waiters came back to let us know it was going to be a minute and they would be able to box it up and take it off the bill. Greatly appreciated by the way. But once it was time to pay that's when the \"okay\" experience took a turn for the worst. The checks were brought and given back for the waiters to do their thing. Once a good 10-15 minutes go by and we see our waiters serving and taking orders we ask ourselves \"so did anyone get their checks back because we have to go?\"  By this point one of the cousins was irritated so she went to complain to a random employee to ask about our bills, he hunted down our waiters and BAM our bills were brought to us! And to top it all off...... The time stamp on the final check was 13 minutes before we received it. Sooooo I don't know who dropped the ball there but it was enough to not want to come back to this restaurant.",

We came for not only the happy hour, but for a friends birthday dinner, and the staff accomodated us very well. As the appetizer, I had Jamaican jerk chicken wings, they're a little dry but flavor is good! And the wings are large, so you definitely get your bang for the buck. For dinner, I ordered the Baja fish tacos, which were delicious! Wish I got the rice and beans, but that was on me. Nonetheless, the food was great. My favorite drink is the pina colada because it's not too sweet but nice, smooth and just sweet enough! Only reason it's not five stars is because some of the servers and waitresses are kind of unfriendly. The waiters and waitresses that we had this night were amazing but there are a few everytime we come here that don't bring the best customer service. Not their entire staff is like this, but some of their staff could be better. Other than that, come here for a good happy hour and good food!",

They also have a great ambience with great music and a nice island vibe, on the weekends they have a live band that plays in the patio .   The food is really good and I personally love all the shrimp dishes but the jerk chicken is slamming as well. I actually was very impressed with the variety of food and the quality of it. I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing evening full of good food, drinks, music, and at a great price.",

The manager came around to personally check each table section to see if we needed anything. The food was tasty, well prepared and attractively plated. You're in good hands here!",

Today, was a bit of a hiccup as my order was wrong twice but our waiter was quick to take it back. He noticed i was picking the tomatoes (gag) off my salad one by one on the second salad delivered and quickly came over and took it back again. Only complaint was the pulled chicken on my salad was hot (was told it's cold, I prefer it cold) & it was rather chewy/hard to pull apart the large chunks.  Most likely it was just slightly over cooked and fresh vs. prepared as it was early in the day. If the chicken had been tender I'd have given a 5 star. Even with the order being off a little.  None the less, I'll be back. Really enjoy their food.",

The rice dish did not look very appetizing, as it looked crusty as if haf been sitting yhere for a while, the server never asked if we liked it, then when we left the rice plate (pretty much full as ordered), the waitress did not as why we didn't eat it or even of we wanted a togo box. We were never asked if we wanted another drink or even if we wanted dessert, just brought the bill and seemed like she wanted us out of her section (probably the end of her shift)  Very disappointed because I guess since we told the server we were locals she didn't when try to give good service.

Located on the corner of Flamingo & Paradise, there is indoor and outdoor seating and a decent amount of parking.  I came here last week for lunch with 5 of my co-workers.  They ask where we would like to sit.  We asked if we could sit in the \"patio\" area; its this big round room and the windows can open when it's nice outside.  So they take us to the table; there are only 3 seats.  We look at the guy that brought us to our table and we say \"this table is a little too small, there are 5 of us\" and he says \"yes, I know.  I have no idea why they brought you out here.  Unfortunately, there isn't any tables out here big enough for your group.\"  We tell him no problem and sit us wherever there is room.  He takes us back inside to the room behind the bar and sits us at a table that is set for 4 people, but enough room for 5.  We ordered a handful of appetizers and each of us ordered entrees.  I ordered the combination chicken & veggie quesadilla and a caesar salad.  The caesar was barely dressed and wasn't that good anyways.  Now, I've had the lobster quesadilla here before and it was gross.  So I thought chicken and fresh vegetables couldn't be that bad.  Well, it's not good.  I don't know how to put it.  But the flavor sucks.  We get a discount to eat here because of where our office is located and I would STILL never come here again.",

    "text": "I have been here a few times and never was the biggest fan, but I will laud Bahama Breeze on my experience today: my friend Susan D. dropped her business card in while at lunch a few weeks ago and won a free happy hour party for 10 people (drinks we had to buy at happy hour prices, which is $3-$4) but it included all sorts of appetizers...and it was seemingly unlimited...for TWO HOURS!  Happy hour is 4-6 PM Monday through Friday, and there are lots of drinks but it looked like only 5 or so choices for apps.  Well, our bartender Melissa hooked it up with more than that and even though there were only 5 of us, she furnished a second round of our faves and almost ordered a third round...of FOOD...and we had to turn her down!  To drink I had the bahamarita, with strawberry, kiwi and mango slush and margarita on top with a side shot of cactus schnapps...interesting and almost like alcoholic jamba juice.  I tried a variety of apps (beef patties which were really empanadas with creole seasoning, coconut shrimp, spinach dip, chicken wings, and chicken sliders) and they also brought out cheeseburger sliders, chorizo sliders, and pulled pork sliders, none of which I tried.  My conclusion is this:  1) a good deal for a free meal, 2) the empanadas, shrimp, and wings were good, the dip not so much, and 3) THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG: the chicken sliders tasted like MINI CHICK-FIL-A sandwiches! I hardly ever eat fried food but I had 4 of these, 2 each round.  Hearty juicy fried white meat chicken, 2 pickle slices, and a tasty bun (that probably has less butter than CFA, a good thing!)  I might die tomorrow but I have to say that after being away from Chick-Fil-A for quite some time, Bahama Breeze solves that craving.  Now if only I can find good waffle fries ever since Caribbean Cooker went out of business.  Moral of this story: Go to Bahama Breeze between 4 and 6, order 1 happy hour priced chicken sliders app and 1 drink for $3 and you will thank me later.  and get Melissa as your bartender, she rocks!",

In addition my wife order a pinacolada. She loved it. It has a little splash of run. If you don't like too much alcohol this is for you otherwise you can order something different. I ordered a margarita mango. This one, I really don't recommend it. Not a good taste. I couldn't found the taste of the mango. It was more alcohol than anything else. Next time I may tried something else. Very affordable and great food.",

I ordered it and it was so strong very good. I was so happy with her passion and knowledge of the food and restaurant in general.

    "text": "It has been a few years since we have eaten here and were looking forward to our favorite sandwiches for lunch. First let me say, that service here is hit or miss. Sometimes it is fabulous. Other times, horrible. There is no in between. This was a horrible time - waitress would not shut up, did not accept that we did not want alcoholic drinks or appetizers and tried to push them on us, she pulled a menu one of my party was holding and started flipping through it, insisted on telling us the \"specials\" despite we knew what we wanted.... anyway - we were looking forward to the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Portabello Mushroom Sandwich. Both were a disappointment - chicken was like rubber, bread tasted bad (not ciabatta anymore). The portabello sandwich was mashed flat as if someone sat on it and the vegetables were diced small and indistinguishable. More so - for a Saturday lunch it was dead... not the normal for this place. Usually it is busy. Looking out the window we got to watch a drunk/high gentleman purusing the parking lot, and then when we left we were confronted by a man who \"wanted to ask us questions\" and when we refused he started swearing, dropping the f-bomb and being obnoxious. It was very unsettling to our group - family members from seniors down to children. The place has not been kept up - although when we entered there was a young girl cleaning the windows, the table was dirty, the ledge where the plants are was full of dust, the menus had food on them. No reason for that.   The area this restaurant is in has certainly changed tremendously and as well, other restaurants in the area seemed to have changed hands/chains as well. If you are on the Strip, I would advise you to stay there and eat. It is not worth the taxi ride over there and I certainly would not advise you to walk down there from your hotel.   This used to be a popular place for lunch for the UNLV crowd, and possibly during the week things are different. But don't waste your time.",

    "text": "The hardest thing is deciding where to start, especially considering I never write reviews.  We had never been to Bahama Breeze before and with trying any new place there is always that slight worry. We walked up to a restaurant that looks as if it was flown in from the Caribbean up to the hostess' stand and were warmly greeted. We were shown our way to the table and were given their menu which has an extensive selection, especially the house cocktails. We were delightlfully greeted by our server Sandra and we informed her it was our first time and we would need a moment to take in the vast menu. She was truly polite and gave us some suggestions and brought us our water while we mulled everything over, that's when our excitement started going up as we looked at the specialty drinks.   I'm not a drinker and the fact that these drinks caught my eye is a good sign. We started off by ordering a truly delicious Bahama Margharita (an infusion of pineapple, strawberry and kiwi with tequila) and my girlfriend a Strawberry Banana Daquiri. Both drinks made to perfection. We started our appatizers in a simple manner with wonderfully crisp coconut shrimp as well as chips and salsa, both which were brought to us very quickly, while we continued to look at the menu. All the while Sandra keeping an eye on us and ensuring our satisfaction. Finally we decided to settle on the Baby Back Ribs for myself an the Filet Mignon for her.   The meal was astounding. The ribs were falling off the bone and well sauced, and the mashed potatoes I requested with them were delicously creamy and flavorful. My girlfriends filet was cooked to perfection and her sides were enjoyed with gusto. We ordered another round of drinks (keep in mind drinks aren't my thing so they must be good for me to order another) but we decided to try something different. My girlfriend tried The Blue (something, I don't recall the rest of the name sadly) and I enjoyed the Berry Berry Good. Both of us would share drinks to try more of a variety and we fell absolutey in love with the Berry Berry Good, as i quote my girlfriend, \"next time I'm getting five of these.'  I'm confident I will as well.  Next we go on to the dessert. When we are as stuffed as were at the end of a meal we don't even consider it, but we figured this place has been so amazing how can we say no? Dulce de Leche Cheesecake and a Chocolate Island (a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse sitting in a delicate sea of a vanilla bean sauce) I didn't want to take it home, i just wanted to eat everything there and get another order to go, it was that incredible. We were so delighted at the end of the meal and asked to see the manager (Jesse is his name) and couldn't begin to describe how happy we were.  All this alone provides something worth noting, but what will truly brings us back beyond anything else is Sandra. We can confidently say that she is without a doubt the greatest server we have ever had. Truly charismatic and professional. When were were looking at our menus in the beggining we saw that she was busy but never once did she let that bother her nor take away from the quality she was providing not just us but everyone. We had great conversations with her and never once did we feel rushed or neglected, it was the exact opposite. She made our night, so much so that on the drive home we were still talking about how amazing she is (plus the quality of the restaurant) We will absolutely make sure that when we go in next we will request her (and if there's a wait we will not mind at all) I cannot stress enough how she truly is the greatest server we have ever had. She is a gem that must never be lost.   Everything about this place is remarkable. They took two first time diners and in one fantastic experience made us die hard fans.",

Pretty good 'island' food and a fun environment for the money, and you will definitely not leave hungry, I have had leftovers each time I ate there.  You HAVE TO get their Cuban Bread for an appetizer, it is pretty simple but my mouth waters just thinking about it.  I have had the paella, coconut shrimp, a chicken pasta dish, and a lobster/shrimp pasta dish and I would order any of them again.  There was something about the chicken pasta dish that I REALLY enjoyed, a tangy garlic cream combo flavor and really tender chicken and mushrooms.  Their red beer is satisfying and for only a couple bucks for a 20oz mug you can definitely throw back a few with no damage to the wallet.  They also have a lot of frozen mixed drinks that looked good but I cant comment on them as I mainly stick to beer when I have a drink. Enjoy!",

With the name, I was quick to be like EGH...boy was I wrong. This just proves the saying, \"Don't knock it, till you try it\". For appetizers, we ordered the Coconut Shrimp and Tostones with Chicken. OMG, both were absolutely perfect, especially the Coconut Shrimp. Its considered one of their house specialties. As for my main order, I had the Chicken Santiago. YUMMY !!!!!!!!! The red roasted pepper sauce sealed the deal. I know this place is a bit off the strip but Yelpers if ever your in Vegas and need a break from the endless buffets, stop by this place, if you lost or possibly won in Vegas, at least you could go home full and satisfied.",

Quick tip If it's a beautiful day outside ask to sit on the patio! My server I forget her name but she's the lady with the braids wrapped up, I love her! I have had her as my server about three times and she really is the sweetest thing in the world. She makes this place feel even more cozy! This place also has a really good happy hour! If you're lucky you'll get to see live entertainment! I always get the tacos, fish or coconut shrimp. Get the firecracker shrimp ! Don't get me started on the drinks. I love the Bahama mama, the pain killer and the ultimate pineapple! You will feel like you're not even in Las Vegas but instead a tropical get away. Definitely head here if you're in the area!",

Loved the creamy (not spicy) dip. \"It's like a cheesy donut\"  Wife tried lobster Mac and cheese.  She removed breading? But otherwise thought it was a good dish.   The Bahamarita virgin was refreshing.   The key lime pie was super!  A nice merengue crust   The seafood chowder was way too spicy for us (we are wimpy about spice). I definitely tasted Cajun spice. The manager took it off our bill no problem.   Our friend loved the mojito and said best in her life. She also liked Vieja Ropa sandwich.",

I arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes early but they would not seat me until half the party was there. We ended up on the \"porch \"which was not too far of a walk but it was freezing in there. I asked one of the hostesses if she could improve the temperature, she did not respond to me directly but just spoke into her radio. The conditions never improved and everyone at the table was freezing. LJ was our server, he was pleasant albeit a little slow. Perhaps it was busy in the other part of the restaurant but it did not appear so from where we were sitting. My son is a vegetarian and ordered the jackfruit tacos - they were inedible so he sent them back in exchange for a salad. My brother-in-law ordered the grilled chicken, he indicated the chicken was rubbery and tasted frozen. I had the skirt steak which was slightly dry but otherwise tasty provided you have the chimichurri sauce which I asked for twice. The other dishes were just OK and we did not elect to stay for dessert. Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure.  a manager never even came by the table to talk about the food that was returned. Will not be returning to this chainy sub par food and service joint.",

I had the shrimp and cheesy grist which were good and loaded with calories . We also added plantains and a side of beans .   Drinks : drinks were amazing and one of the reason we will be back . We had the coconut mojito which was amazing and also a margarita which was pretty standard .

This place was made both inside and out to be as if you were somewhere in the Caribbean, and it definitely reminded me of how it'd be like. The folks dining there even looked the part with most even wearing 'island tiki' type of tops and dresses.  I was also surprised by how decent the menu pricing was with majority of the dinner menu around $18-23/25 and that's with steak/seafood items!  Our server was also a nice and attentive man, with whom I forgot the name of (sorry!).  We both really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, slightly dimmed with a mini waterfall running upon entering the restaurant that you hear along with Caribbean pop-type of music.  And the entree portions were good enough to get us full but not TOO full. We'd definitely be back to try some of their l drinks from their extensive drink menu next time!   Thanks Bahama Breeze (You made the experience way better than my prom experience couple years ago lol).",

We did not care for the empanadas. The lobster and shrimp quesadilla was the real winner. The firecracker shrimp and jerk chicken wings were just ok.  The Drinks were better than the food. The drinks had a light alcohol taste. Service was fast and we never had to look for the server. He was always prompt with refills and checking on us.   Not impressed overall with the food.

We saw they had fried lobster tails, so at that moment our minds were made on where to have dinner. I ordered the jerk chicken pasta but sent it back because it was too lemony. I hate to be that person who sends back food, but I couldn't get through the dish. They were very understanding about it and let me switch it with no problem. The food was great, service was great, and prices were reasonable. I highly recommend going!",

I had just checked in for my marathon (it started at MIDNIGHT), so I was a little thrown about how to do my calorie intake ahead of time since I'm so used to my breakfast routine with marathons! This place was across the street from the hotel and had good reviews, so I gave it a go.   They have inside and sort of sunroom seating, which was a little toasty, but there was live music going on while I ate which was kind of nice. Even with the marathon, I decided to try one of their cocktails and it was delicious! Though I usually wouldn't like this, it was a plus that it wasn't super boozy. Their menu is very extensive and honestly a work of art. They have tons of pictures with all of the items so you know what to expect. I ended up getting salmon with sweet potatoes and veggies (great pre-marathon mix), and the portions were huge! Definitely more than enough food. This place was exactly what I needed food-wise. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the service was not great. To begin it was fine, but once I started eating and said I wasn't going to be ordering any more drinks, I didn't see my waiter again for almost 40 minutes (seriously). I was reading a book, so it wasn't a huge deal, but I was done with my meal a full twenty minutes before he brought the check, and I was in a bit of a hurry at that point.",

There is an indoor and patio seating where there was live music (the patio seating is still indoor but it is created with an outdoor, beach-y setting). I went around 7pm for dinner  and we had the Rum Week special drinks--drinks were $2-6 during this time. I tried the bahama mama and painkiller, both tasted like coconut. Painkiller was creamy.  I would recommend this place for Happy Hour. The appetizers (around $5) and some drinks were half off. Thursday-Sunday 9pm to close and Monday to Wednesday 4-6pm.  I enjoyed the food and someone was often checking on us. I tried the tequila burnt salmon. I didn't really taste the tequila but the mango salsa truly made the meal. Sweet potatoes was delicious and green beans were cooked just right.",

Our server Brandon was great he was very attentive and professional. He had excellent customer service skills and with a large party he never missed a beat.   So the four star came from the food. The fish tacos and  calamari  were just so so. Wouldn't order them again. The jerk shrimp was very tasty as that was the favorite at the table. I had a tropical fruit salad, no meat just fruit lettuce and a very tasty vinaigrette and that was also very tasty. The jerk wings on the small plate menu was bigger than a small plate. They were four jumbo sized jerk wings cooked crispy with jerk sauce and those were really tasty. So Overall five stars on service (thanks Brandon and Bob) and four stars for the food.",

Roger, our server, was unhappy from the moment he took our order so I apologize if he was having a bad night before us.  Asked him to please split the four checks early on as a courtesy, before we ordered our drinks, instead of at the end.  He had attitude & said he will see what the manager says?    Asked for no bell peppers or onions in the quesadillas, he said it's already mixed in.  I said ok how about the Veggies & Coconut Rice, no bell peppers.  He says they can't do that either... I asked him to please ask the chef.  He said he knows he can't but will ask.  Instead he has the manager, Moma come over?  She said I heard you have some questions.  I said we'd like the checks split, we have four coupons for $10 & no bell peppers in the Vegan Entree.  She said no problem to that... I said Roger should have said that instead of telling me no, he should've said 'let me ask the chef' or something instead of no & send the manager over.    We ordered a few items & tasted is variety.  The Skirt Chimichurri was dry & horrid.  The Rios Vistones something or the other was plantain cups stuffed w/ beef.  It was hard as a rock.  I had to use the steak knife to cut it.  The Veggies over coconut rice was a soup.  I said I'll need a soup spoon please Roger, he said it's not soup it's veggies w/ sauce over rice like a Asian dish not a Caribbean dish.  I was shocked cause it was served in a soup bowl.  My friend ate it instead.  It was Soup.  I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Tacos w/ Flour tacos of course since they were out of corn.  It was good, along with The Cobb Salad, only good items.  Would have sent the other three back if it wasn't for the fact that the dining experience was already difficult.    Overall, horrible dining experience, stomach ache afterwards & glad we used up our coupons as we won't be coming back for awhile.",

We ordered the Braised Oxtail, the Chipotle Chicken Salad and the Tequila Sunburn Glazed Salmon. The salad was good but that's pretty hard to mess up. The Oxtail was just OK in my opinion. I had the salmon and I really didn't like it very much. It was very dry and over cooked.   The highlight of the dinner was actually the dessert. We had the Coconut Grande which was coconut cake and ice cream served in a coconut shell. This alone was worth going for. It was so delicious!!!

I've actually been to the one in Vegas a couple times but that was months ago. I went in today during lunch time and was seated quickly.   Today, I ordered the seafood paella because I've been eating way too much red meat and needed to switch it up. It is a pretty good amount of food so if you aren't too hungry you'll definitely be taking home leftovers. The rice was very flavorful so we were off to a good start. The shrimp and scallops were good as well however, the mussels, chicken and sausage were all dry and the fish didn't have much flavor. So I was definitely a bit disappointed.   My service was amazing and the waiter was very attentive. Refilled my drinks and brought me a box without me even needing to ask. He also gave me a soda to go without me asking which was great. I am going to give this place 4 stars because the other times I have been to this location my food was really good (I'll attach a pic from my last visit) & the service was also great those times as well. Next time I visit will either solidify the 4 stars or bring it down but we will have to wait until next time.",

    "text": "I am pretty open to tasting many types of food at least once. You would also think since I tried this place, which I found in Florida when I took a trip down there, the food would be the same. However, this was not the case.   The original Bahama Breeze started in Central Florida (Orlando), which caters mostly to Caribbean food. So I decided randomly one night, when staying out in Florida to give the place a try. Also, why not, it was also my first time eating Caribbean food ever in my life. After tasting the food out in Florida, Caribbean food became my top favorites.  Fast forward to now living out in Vegas, we decided to try it finally after over a year. My fiance was also beyond happy as well since he's never tried Caribbean food ever. We came in the middle of the afternoon, place is located off of the strip, but in reach of those staying at the Hard Rock hotel. Located directly in Hughes Center. We walked in, place was pretty empty. We were seated right away, but the table appeared to be sticky and gross feeling, so we had our waiter wipe down the table again.   Since I have not been back to this establishment in awhile, we decided to get something that we thought would be on point. We both decided to order the classic platter. This had Jamaican Jerk Chicken, pork, plantains, pulled pork, collard greens, rice, beans, and empanadas. Awesome at first. Then not in 15 minutes in, we got our orders to eat. I thought this was kind of usual, because it was already made to order, it would take at least double the time with the amount ordered. We were starving, so we dug in.   Chicken was okay, was not as juicy or fall off the bone, nor was it like the Jamaican Jerk seasoning that I tasted back in Florida. Pork was greasy and tasted old as well as the collard greens. I ate about half of it and knowing my fiance, he wanted to take the rest home and not waste it. The entire drive home, I felt sick and bloated. A couple of hours later I started having major cramping to the point where I was using the heating pad. I thought it was a stomach ache and took something for my stomach. However, that did not work either as I did get to sleep the entire night. My fiance, then also decided to eat the rest and ended being sick to the point where he vomited the rest of the next day.   Never ever again, will we be returning as this is by far the worse case scenario of food poisoning to even get. Let alone the first place, where both of us almost ended up in the ER. Looks can be deceiving as well as the taste. So make sure that you check the establishment is clean and not contaminated. It may have been that one time, but will definitely not step foot in here again.",

The beans were not very warm so I asked our waitress and she brought me back a new plate with nice hot black beans. My dish took about 5 minutes to get back to the table so I was able to enjoy my meal with the rest of the group. The meat was so tasty, loved the beans and the rice. The only negative on my dish were the tostones. I was expecting them to be made out of plantain but they tasted like corn. Other than that the meal was delicious! My husband had the coconut shrimp and our cousins had the mahi mahi dish which based on their expressions and comments they loved, too!!!  The restaurant is large, they play caribbean music, service is great, bathrooms are very clean. Nice place if you want to take a break from the huzzle and buzzle of the strip. I definitely reco",

However, the food was not very good. It was our first time here so we wanted to get appetizers to try everything. So we got the chorizo meatballs, fried calamari, spinach dip, and the empanadas. Now when we were first sat down we were told they were a branch of Olive Garden so we weren't expecting fresh food. But the food was not very good. Maybe it was just what we ordered but the only dish that we thought was half decent was the empanadas. The chorizo meatballs tasted like ground beef in an odd BBQ sauce. The spinach dip had 3 full artichokes in it like it wasn't cut up enough. And the calamari was very chewy. We were impressed with the service and drinks but the food we ordered was nothing impressive.",

I don't really care for the tutorial of what's on what page of the menu but I just thought it was nice she actually cared about her job.  The food was pretty good. I really don't have anything memorable to say about it, so it was neither fantastic or awful. We arrived during lunch and had an unusually long layover in Vegas. This was one of the closest places to eat.",

It was my first time going so the decor shocked me. It was just like a beach bungalow so pretty. They can accommodate large and small groups. We were seated towards the front on the right right side at a large round table. The waiter was from Oregon and had pink hair that we all loved. It's cool people get to have personalities there. It's very diverse and inclusive. We ordered a few drinks off happy hour that were strong! Good but strong. They have half off appetitizers that are large portions. The food was amazing! I could have stayed longer if we didn't have work the next day. Overall, I'll be back!",

The food is always amazing, I tend to get the same thing every time, the Lemon Grass Mahi Mahi and Shrimp with rice.  Our server was Kahla, AMAZING service! Please ask for her if you can. She kept us laughing, kept our glasses full at all times. We went twice in three days with a large party and the second time we asked for Kahla. The second time with out even asking she remembered our drink orders and brought it to us immediately! Now that is service. Oh wait did I mention her great smile? Best service I have received here. But then again it's always been good.   I recommend it strongly if you want good food at a good price!",

Comes with a side of sauce to add taste but does not do justice.  Banana Nut Bread Supreme- delicious!!! Not too sweet, bread is moist and goes perfect with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with is included. Perfect end to a meal :)  Great for family gatherings!",

The tables were being bussed quickly and my servicer was super attentive. The food was awesome. I had the ahi tuna salad and it was huge!!  Not with just lettuce but it had lots of tuna which was perfectly cooked and had a delicious seasoning on  it.  My daughter had grilled salmon which looked good but the surprise was her mashed potatoes. They were real  potatoes with some of the skin left on it.  I have to say their mashed potatoes are one of the best in Las Vegas. So creamy and with the perfect consistency.  I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu.",

Our conversation was the faire you might hear in the watering holes frequented by other raconteurs like Oscar or Tark or Stephen Colbert(bring it on Colbert, I know  a lot of big words too.) But don't let my account give you the impression that the Breeze is a toilet populated by drunks boring the rest of the drunks with stories they've told too many times. The Breeze is an island with all of the amenities you would find in a tropical locale. Stout, jerk chicken, dirty rice, cuba libre, huachinango veracruzana, and conch fritters are all spoken here. When's the last time you had a bowl of Paella Valenciana? Never? Well we got it here, mon. They've also got the Cajun equivalent, jambalaya.  The Breeze is online and you can check  the menu out anytime you want to. They have take out too. My new found friend and I had a great time and you will too. Check it out.",

We were in a booth near the POS and got to listen to the disgruntled servers the whole time we were there. The food didn't make the experience any better, lacked flavor and seasoning. Would be hard pressed to recommend it based on this experience.",

Very professional and willing to address all my questions considering this was my first time. Once my guest and I were seated at the table our waitress Anita blew me away with her PHENOMENAL customer service! She was so knowledgeable about the drink menu, the appetizers, and the background of the different foods that I literally felt as if I were in the Bahamas and completely forgot I was in Las Vegas. After ordering our drinks and food came out quickly and everything was DELICIOUS! What truly made my experience amazing was Anita! She was fun, personable, and really demonstrated the epitome of what I consider a phenomenal customer service experience! Because of her service this will now be my go-to drinks & appetizers choice when scheduling my weekly hangouts with friends and coworkers. And yes, I will be requesting Anita every time! I was so impressed with Anita's service that I literally chased the manager Sean down just to rave about Anita. To my surprise, considering he was busy, my interrupting him didn't phase him one bit. He was very professional and equally as enthusiastic about Anita as I was! He genuinely thanked my guest and I for visiting and guess what else....genuinely invited us to come back and visit again! I can't say enough great things about this place!!!!! Thanks Tiffany, Anita, and Sean.",

One recommendation that is a have to if you like this place: sign up to get their emails.  Once or twice a year, they have free parties.  You can RSVP for up to five people.  They serve free food and drink.  The last one, they only gave you one free drink (in the past it was unlimited).  BUT I won a gift card to come back and dine. For regular dinning, the coconut shrimp or the seafood paella.  Yum!",

Located off the strip near the Hard Rock Hotel, Bahama Breeze was a delightful place from beginning to end.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Seafood Paella without the sausage, which our server said could be done.  One of the chefs came out a few moments later and said that the paella was made with the sausage in it and that they would be picking it out, which was fine with me so long as there wasn't any sausage actually on my plate.  I really appreciate this gesture because I know that not a lot of vegetarians would be cool with that.  When it came, I devoured it, which wasn't easy because it was a big plate of food.  My wife had the Fresh Pan-Seared Salmon Pasta, which was also amazing!  We had a couple of their specialty mixed drinks, which are not on the on-line menu so I don't recall the names.  But they were also very tasty.  Seems to me like most of the good food in Vegas is off the strip, and this would be a perfect example.    We shall return!",

The mojitos tend to be a little sweet for me but they get the job done.  The banana bread dessert was amazing the last time I had it, as was the pineapple upside down cake.  And the servers have always been fun and friendly.  Oh, and free wi-fi.  Gotta love that!  The entrees need some work though.  They all tend to be really greasy.  I did not see one pasta without cream sauce, except on the kids menu.  You can make some ok food here if you are creative, but it'll take you about 5 minutes to order with all the special requests.  My favorite is probably the chicken kabob with steamed broccoli instead of rice.  Yes, even the rice was too greasy for me.  But the servers have always been willing to put in special requests and get the meal just the way I want it.  The problem is that it has taken a lot of experimentation to get there.  They used to have a lemongrass chicken sandwich that was decent but they took it off the menu. Oh well, I can always just stick to a liquid diet.  :)",

Our table was pretty good. The bench cushions were  a little low for some of the older people in the group but our waitress was really nice and accommodating.  For such a large group, she did amazing. She got the orders right and was very attentive.   I ordered the firecracker shrimp to start. It was so good. Seasoning was off the hook. Large serving for an appetizer. My beer was nice and cold also.    I then ordered the fish tacos. I have been a little spoiled living in California I suppose. The tacos were okay. Not enough pop and flavor for me. I was looking for that citrus pop of freshness but it wasn't there. The tortillas were a little chewy. Food alone would have gotten them a three, but when you throw in the awesome service, you can't beat it. The waitress made a fresh pot of coffee for us and the DJ gave my daughter  a Bahama breeze pen.  Everyone loved their food and there were no complaints. Decent price for what you get.

It started with a very nice waitress who came to my table... it started like this,   'Today's specials are A, B, C, and D. We are out of A and B, and if you want C, we no longer have chorizo that goes in it but we can substitute it for something else.'  Um what??!   So we asked her for her suggestions and her 'most recommended' items were the Lobster Linguine and the Key West Shrimp and Grits. My husband and I ordered both dishes. Disgusting. You know what this reminded me of? It reminded me of something premade that comes in a bag and thrown in boiling water to heat up.  Really disappointed. We had just wasted money on food that tasted nasty and we were walking out hungry. Never, ever, again. Visited this location June 2014.",

Also the empanadas are very good too. There are a lot of great dishes here from full plate steaks down to specialty tacos and of course wonderful burgers custom made! Save room for dessert.

The baby back ribs was falling off the bone tender and my 3 year old ate one after another. The jerk chicken taste way better than it looks. The nachos were a classic fave.

The waitresses were on point, friendly, and nice. The only thing that could've made this experience better was if my husband was there but I understand he had to work. Someone has to make money but I definitely would go here again and my sister loved it so much she wants to come here on her Birthday. Oh and last but not least the mango beach drink is to die for!

    "text": "I am trying to like this place but twice I am asked to wait 15 minutes for a table when the restaurant isn't busy and there's no one waiting in front of me. After waiting they tried to sit me in the large dining area where no one was sitting. I traveling for work and dining alone so I think they are trying to force me to eat at the bar.   My first visit was mediocre. I ordered a beer which came to me in a bottle that a runner just dropped on the table and ran away. The beer was warm inside but the bottle was cold and the label was about ready to fall off. I guessed they tried to ice down  a room temperature beer. The waiter at least offered a glass for my beer.  I ordered the grilled chicken with cilantro cream. The chicken didn't have much taste since it seemed to be grilled then some bland glaze added on top. There was a bed of mash potatoes that was smothered in a  green 'cilantro' sauce which I liked but I'm a sucker for any thing smothered in gravy.   So overall I would go back here but I don't expect great good. It's is reasonably price but nothing special.  If you go during happy hour you can make out like a bandit with half price apps and drinks for dinner. Happy hour is 9pm to midnight.",

    "text": "I had a gift card for Bahama Breeze that I got on my birthday and I had forgotten until one day I drove by and decided it was the perfect time to use it. I was solo so decided to seat at the bar and blend in into the party ambiance, although not planned that way I landed there during happy hour which gave my gift card extra buying power. As I waited patiently at the bar a couple sat by me and were instantly acknowledged and asked if they wanted drinks, they ordered two mojitos and the bartender left to make them, when she came back with their drinks she asked them if they were ready to order, it was then that I realized I have the power of being invisible if no one is looking. I sort of interrupted and asked if I could have a drink and that I was ready to order, she took their order and then took mine giving me that \"can't you wait for your turn? look\" I ordered the paella which was very good although not authentic for it was made with long grain rice but the result was the same, a delicious zafron rice dish loaded with seafood! I also got the coconut shrimp with some kind of sweet n sour sauce that was equally delicious as the paella, there are also many more items on the menu that I would love to try like the Jamaican chicken or firecracker shrimp they both sounded good I just didn't have the belly space but I'm working on expanding. The setting is also very nice, the building is like a large plantation house very spacious with high ceilings and nice breezy caribbean atmosphere with indoor and outdoor sections.    The waitress returned to ask the people by my side if everything was ok, they asked her if she could take their picture and I took advantage of the opportunity and asked her for my check hoping not to interrupt a perfect customer waitress relation.  I'm definitely coming back..what else can I ask for? Awesome fun and clean environment, excellent delicious food and outstanding service...........for the couple sitting next to me!",

    "text": "Bahamas Breeze really is a local gem for Las Vegans. The ambiance is laid back and tropical. They even have a small water feature running the length of the Restaraunt. The staff are all polite and I have never had a bad experience here. In addition, the staff will do anything to make your visit enjoyable (including singing and dancing for my crying 3 year old).   The drinks here are reasonably priced for the size - they are quite large! And not to mention mixed very well. They taste like kool-aid and, according to my husband, are quite dangerous on the intoxication meter as you can drink and drink as of there were no alcohol - until you stand up from your seat.   Food: I personally love the jerk chicken pasta. The asparagus and mushrooms work very well with the spices of the chicken and the pasta sauce. The husband loves the chicken salad, and the burgers here are also very good. The portions are large, so a single entree is enough to share between 2 adults, which is nice.   I think Bahamas Breeze is one of the best restaurants in Vegas. Off the strip. Not too expensive. Good for families. And the food quality is high.",

    "text": "My party shows up, we tell the hostess we have a party of nine and after I said I didn't have a reservation she seemed like she didn't want to deal with me. Reluctantly she said the wait was fourty minutes. A few minutes later another member of my party showed up. After I said the weight was 40 minutes, she went to go ask again to double check. When she came back she said the hostess rolled her eyes and was sassy when she said the wait was still 40 minutes. They seated us in 40 minutes, I didn't mind the wait because we did have a big party but I thought the service was bad. I've been here several times before and I love the ropa vieja sandwich and any of their flavored lemonades. I ordered the ropa vieja sandwich again. It came out in a reasonable time, but it tasted awful. The bread tasted like it was old or like the sandwich was microwaved. Normally the meat is tender but this time it was tough and it almost hurt my jaw to chew it, and certain parts of the sandwich were cold. My raspberry lemon breeze tasted like it was powdery and way too sweet. Our waitress was nice but she didn't come back until it was time for dessert. We ordered a key lime pie. If you like eating straight up sugar, you'll love this dessert. The crust tastes like hardened brown sugar, it melts in your mouth. Which I would like, but it was way too sweet.  Needless to say, I'm not sure I will come back to Bahama Breeze. Or at least not with a group or when it's busy. But I'm not sure if I want to pay for rude service and bad food with decent dessert and drinks.",

    "text": "Last night 2 friends and I were looking for somewhere to get food and drinks after the fireworks on 4th of July. We tried to go to Herbs & Rye but it was closed! We eventually ended up at Bahama Breeze, and it was honestly a great experience. I have been here a handful of times before and have always enjoyed it. I really love their late night happy hour, although we could not take advantage of that last night because it was a Saturday, oh well. Without a doubt my absolute favorite thing about this place is that every single item from drinks to food to dessert has the CALORIE COUNT on the menu! This is super helpful for me since I log all of my calories daily. I chose the Painkiller cocktail which was delicious, for dinner I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich on a brioche bun for only 400 calories, and I added avocado which was a generous portion and perfectly ripe. My choice of side was the Vine Ripened Tomato Salad which came in a balsamic dressing and was very good as well. I also ordered a glass of Cabernet and it was great. My friends had the Shrimp and Grits which looked incredible, and a steak with mashed potatoes which was perfectly cooked, and a nice looking Caeser Salad and Clam Chowder. I would have liked to order a dessert but there was nothing even remotely low in calories lol. Service was great and we were all pleased with our meals, and I like that they are open until midnight every night.",

Dessert was molten chocolate cake with pineapple. It was good but nothing really outstanding about it.  They also offer happy hour and late happy hour. I'd recommend catching those. Their appetizer options are all half off which makes that lobster quesadilla only $7 yum!",

The server never came over after the last person in our group arrived to order drinks.  We had to call him over from where he was talking a group of employees.  Once drinks and appetizers came and dinner was finally ordered, it took forever.  No one came by to see if we needed any additional drinks while we waited.  Once dinner finally came, we mentioned to the server that we planned on ordering desert.  He never came back for the order.  Dirty dishes on the table, empty drink glasses, and no server.  We were really disappointed.  In addition to the lousy service, there were bugs flying around the table.  I think they were coming from the plants on the side and end of the booth.  A member of the group thought they were coming from the kitchen.  We ended up speaking with a manager when we were finally ready to leave.  The response was \"the restaurant provides an island atmosphere.\"  I can completely understand that if the table was taken care of.  I don't feel the island atmosphere was having the table ignored and swatting at bugs for two hours.  Did leave for a tip, hoping they are shared with the bartender and the kitchen.  After a disappointing evening, we won't be returning.",

Drinks - all of their signature cocktails were just sugar bombs with not of lot of depth. Cheap tasting stuff.   Food - I got the coconut fried shrimp as a appetizer, and it was really tasty and well done. I ordered the fruit and chicken Caribbean salad and it was ok. The chicken was of the same quality you get in those giant frozen bags at Sams club, and it was just gross, it really felt like fake chicken, like they boiled it, idk. Don't order any of their chicken dishes. The salad was overdressed but was yummy at first. It's a very pretty dish.   Someone at my table got key lime pie and really like it.   The prices here are reasonable, if you don't expect above Chili's level cuisine. I will go here again and update this review after trying more of their \"signature\" dishes. 2 stars for now.",

I had agreed to get the full order beef bowl to share, but, after I tasted it,  I wanted to protect it like the last package of Twinkies in a zombie apocalypse. Hubby loved on his ribs while I shielded my bowl from his wandering fork.  There's no room for dessert, but, my flashy green drink was good,  too. Our waiter was attentive and the water was flowing.

If you like coconut..like the malibu rum coconut, you would love the Pineapple Coconut Margarita. Not my cup of tea, but could be yours! I wouldn't recommend the Mojito Cubano unless you're looking for an average glass of mojito.   Recommendations off appetizers: Coconut shrimp- Perfect balance of shrimp and batter. Flavor was on point as well.  Crispy onion rings- JUMBO sized onion rings Jumbo Lump Crab Cake- Crab can taste a little like the sea, but the shrimp avocado and mango salsa made up for it. This dish tasted really fresh, I would recommend it if you like crab and shrimp.  Warm spinach dip, chips, and salsa- The salsa was delicious! Artichoke was mediocre.   Chicken quesadillas- Nothing special Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sliders- This was okay, wasn't extra savory or anything.  Habanero wings- Disappointment. Wasn't spicy at all.   Interior very spacious and our waiter was friendly. Will be back if in the area.",

He helped us with all our questions,  suggested we come back for happy hour. .and was extremely attentive. We had the ahi tuna and jamaican chicken wings - both were delicious..the wings are FULL wings too - all 3 sections. I had the salmon and fresh greens tostadas and my husband had the salmon.  Both were so good..nobody was talking during the meal. .we were so absorbed in our meals! And lastly - THE MUSIC...Live music..music by Bob Marley, Jimmy Buffet and an easy, grooving island feel to the entire restaurant - which can easily accommodate large groups.  A new LV favorite for us! We will definitely be back for happy hour!!",

Food today didn't have any of those amazing sauces and was void of flavor. Asked the waiter if they forgot the sauce but he said they no longer include the mango sauce with the tacos. I think hospital cafeteria food would have tasted better than what we had today. New cooks? New recipes? The table next to me complaining to the manager about their food too. Sad that one of my favorite restaurants lost it's mojo....but I'll give it 3 stars because the staff was nice and restaurant was clean.",

They also have 4$ and 5$ cocktails using decent brands as well , and happy hour is available anywhere in the restaurant, which is great for people with children!!  Some happy hour highlights are the spinach dip , a large bowl of gooey goodness served with warm chips , also their wings are amazing no matter which you choose ( the Jamaican jerk , tho are an acquired taste ) and the large portion of coconut battered onion rings are crispy and delicious ! So check them out !!",

They should be with all the butter they add.   Excellent meal if you're not looking for something heavy.  Now about the SERVICE.   - We sat at the bar and were greeted with an obnoxious bartender.  - When asking for water he just had to say \"so you just want good ole lake mead?\" Tackiest way to try and upsell. I wish he would try that at a fine dining establishment.  - He tried to memorize our two simple order and of course he messed up. Use a pen and paper next time. - forgot to put in our appetizer & never realized it.  The guy definitely had a few drinks before work.   If I ever return I'll grab a table.  FYI I love lake mead water.",

The mayo was so good we used it on everything after this course!   Then we had the Jerk Chicken Pasta with a side Caesars salad and the Island Hopper appetizer as a meal.  The pasta was loaded with asparagus and mushroom with some chicken all cooked well.  The light portion was huge, so no need for the regular portion.   The side salad was fresh and tasty, but absolutely too big.  The Hopper was tasty with great coconut shrimp, huge crispy jerk wings, big onion ring and conch fritters.  WAY too much food!!  Everything was good, but the 3 sauces on the platter can't hold a candle to the Shiracha mayo!  Would definitely return here, but wait for happy hour to get 1/2 off appetizers and drinks.",

    "text": "We had taken a drive to get to know the area and to wander for an early dinner. We found Bahama Breeze and after a warm welcome, a peek at the menu and a 3 minute wait we were seated and ready to go. Christine B. Gave a great fun evening- humor, promptness, very helpful explanations about the meals and drinks. I had the mango caipirosca drink with vodka and mango, the sriracha fish tacos with tomato salad ( light meal so I can protect my dear spouse from anentire key lime pie slice) and he had a great shrimp rice bowl. Delicious!!! Big portions. The pie was excellent and almost tart enough to be killer- with a perfect crust. The service was individualized and professional. You know if my tough reviewer husband wants to come back, this was seriously very good!! I have my next assignment: stuffed plantain with crab on top!! One tip for management: we were both stunned to see that waitresses must bus their own tables. Now the plates and bowls here are large and very heavy stoneware. This is wear and tear on your very important team. We are hopeful that our concerns reach the ears of big cheeses. Maybe an undercover boss is needed- I can see no CEO working anywhere near as hard as did the staff tonight. Docking one CEO a star for a really dumb move.",

    "text": "Can you believe this was my first time here after living in Vegas almost 20 years?! This is one of my new favorite places! When we walked in I felt like I was on an island getaway. We were greeted by 3 very friendly staff members who escorted us to our table and introduced us to our server Deja who was the sweetest! She welcomed us and gave us their daily specials as well as made some recommendations when we weren't sure what to order. I love the atmosphere here it makes you so relaxed and they have the best selection of tropical vacation drinks, you know the kind with the little umbrellas haha. Our food came out lightning fast! Our appetizer was the Breeze Cheese Bites which are crisp fried yuca stuffed with melted cheese and cilantro crema dipping sauce. It was ok, to be honest it wasn't something I would order again because the \"melted cheese\" wasn't melted it was just a stick of cheese inside a fried yuca ball. For my entree I ordered the coconut shrimp tacos (2) and Deja recommended the fresh fruit with sorbet for my side which was amazing! The fish tacos were good but they were really spicy! I know it came with sriracha aioli but wow they were hotter than expected. The coconut shrimp had good flavor and the size was good too. The tortillas were cold and kind of hard. Ill come back because of the excellent service but order something else next time. This would be a great place to come with a group of friends they have a pretty big selection of food and drinks!",

We recently went to this restaurant to celebrate my sister's birthday, sad to say it will not be a birthday that we look back on fondly. The service was just AWFUL! Along with this, there were bugs flying around the restaurant throughout the meal. Our server, although friendly, ignored us and made us feel forgotten. We had wanted to order more drinks and dessert, but after sitting there for two hours we were all ready to leave.   We spoke to the manager, who did not seem to be concerned and gave us the excuse for the slow service that they were trying to \"provide and island experience.\" I have been to the Islands and I can assure you that there is a difference between \"Island experience\" and just BAD service.   Unfortunately I can say for certain that my family and I will not be returning. I do hope that the manager shares our feedback with this team and that no other patrons go through what we went through.",

She loves water fountains & water falls so she loved seeing a wishing fall right when you enter.   Our food was amazing, I ordered the Stuffed Plantain and it was so good. All of their plates are pretty large, great for sharing or just taking the rest home. Our kiddos ordered the kids Mac n' Cheese and it was pretty good, they ate it all. Once again the plates are pretty big so our kiddos shared that plate and it was more than enough for them. My husband ordered the Skirt Steak Churrasco & enjoyed it, he as well ordered a Coconut Mojito which was fresh with a hint of sweetness. I ordered their Mango Lemonade for myself and the kiddos and we loved it. A little on the sweeter side but it comes chilled so it tastes good, I'm not big on sweet drinks but this was pretty good.   We plan on going back for sure.",

Ordered the jerk shrimp app it's like a scampi def not what I expected but very good. The jerk chicken and rice meat was amazing and I just had to get the paella.. man it was amazing I am so pissed I didn't have a bigger appetite. The service and staff were all kind and attentive.

We were greeted and seated well.   Then came the most flamboyant black male waiter ever. For some reason he completely lost it when I inquired about the chicken quesadilla. He told me they weren't that good and I still decided to try them. He then, while rolling his eyes, said,\" so you're going to try something and then send it back if you don't like it, AFTER I just told you it's not that good?\" I replied,\"yes!\"   So the food was bought to the table and the food was freshly cook, and quesadilla was good. There were two male waiters that for some reason were extra loud and at times inappropriate. For example this waiter at my table continued to make it obvious that he was addressing my girlfriend alone, right from the moment he first approached the table.   At some point, I'll return to the restaurant but they lost points with me. We were having a great night and this experience with the waiter messed the vibe up, completely.",

It is two blocks from the Strip, just far enough to spare you from the chaotic traffic but close enough that you can ride-share to it; and if location isn't enough to sell you, their happy hour will.  With $5 Wines, $5 Well Drinks, and half-off appetizers what is not to love? My highlights were their Jamaican Chicken Wings and Coconut Shrimp paired with a Frozen Bahamarita. They have something for everyone, their menu ranging from dishes of all sizes.  TIP: If you're going to eat here over the summer (which is like May through September in Las Vegas) make sure you are seated in the main dining room and not in either of the patios because while the tropical decor is to die for, you will literally die from the heat",

We don't expect people to completely understand these dietary restrictions, but Fred did. He let us know exactly what to order and not to order. (Fyi... the black bean soup has pork in it).   I had the linguine. It was very good. The sauce had a slight spicy kick, but just enough. My son had the tilapia, which I was grateful to see on the kids menu.   Summer is reggae time. I wish we knew this Saturday night. They have a 5 piece Jamaican band Saturdays, but we missed it. There was a live musician though, who was fun and friendly. Loved the music and the atmosphere at this place.   The Bahamarita was fun and delicious. Even better, they have a virgin version, which made my daughter's night.   When my daughter melted down and wanted to leave immediately (it was late), Fred was super fast getting us out the door. This goes a long way in my book.",

There are plenty of parking at front of the restaurant. The building  reminds me of the Caribbean Islands. Love the posts with fire like effects, the huge beach chairs at the entrance, and the music.  Bahama Breeze is open for lunch and dinner, and it stays open late. Love the Happy Hour specials, on week nights 4pm-6pm and 9pm till closing. They are offering 50% off appetizers and reduced price beverages! You have to be lucky to get seated immediately! This place is very popular with locals and tourists. When you signed up for a waiting list, you have to provide your phone numbers and then they'll be text you when the table is available for you. Usually it doesn't take long. Host/hostess is always very polite. They are asking you if you were dining here before, remind you to watch where you step up or down ... the restaurant has lots of little stairs all around. Waiters/waitresses are also very polite, very knowledgeable about their food and drinks.  I'm a kind of person who is always looking at the menu for minutes and then I always get the same items over and over again. My favorite dinner is the Shrimp and Lobster linguine ... It's a huge portion! Never left dissatisfied or hungry! Perfectly cooked pasta with lots of yummy seafood and creamy sauce. I always ask for freshly grated Parmigiana cheese to add. It really enhances the flavor of the meal. I also like to add an order of Caesars salad. If you add the salad to the entree, it only costs $2.99. My other favorite item is a Seafood Paella. Lots of shrimp and oysters and baked chicken on top of Spanish rice. This meal has lots of flavor! Also a huge portion.  My daughter ordered Lobster and shrimp quesadilla from HH menu. Very tasty appetizer, lots of shrimp and lobster pieces with spinach and cheese on flour tortillas. It is served with very mild salsa and sour cream. The Coconut Shrimps from HH menu is our other favorite item. It is served with mango salsa, very yummy!  Their specialty cocktails are very well made, always garnished beautifully. Sometimes I order the Original Cuban Mojito. The only problem I have with this when it is made with way to much ice. I have to ask for a \"less ice\" version of it.  The Original Lemonade is very good here! It's non-alcoholic, but it's coming from the bar, so it takes forever to get it, sometimes! Other drinks, like soft drinks or iced tea ... never had a problem to get refills. Service is always good, servers are very attentive.  The restaurant is very casual. Happy to return again and again!",

We ordered the Caribbean lobster and Mac and cheese plate the lobster was fried and it was oh so delicious... I made the mistake of getting a Caesar salad which was good but my eyes definitely went for the spinach dip and chips that we ordered as an appetizer... As far as drinks get the Hibiscus Margarita !!!tasted like juice yum!!! Or the Tamarind margarita with 1800 Reposado !!!...the whole meal for two with appetizers and drinks and even a chocolate dessert and $20 tip came out total $113!!!! Pretty good for all we ate !!!",

    "text": "Came in for happy hour on a Monday night and there were still at least 7 other parties dining. The decor is definitely Caribbean inspired. We ordered the bahamarita ($5 during HH) which a very nice fruity frozen treat with a very subtle tequila taste. It comes with a shot of cactus juice schnapps which was not very strong either. We ordered the lobster and shrimp quesadilla and coconut shrimp appetizers from the HH menu. The coconut shrimp was amazing. The butterflied shrimp were not overly fried and there was just enough coconut in the batter. The quesadilla was a bit lukewarm and there didn't seem to be very much lobster. I could only really taste shrimp. It was a decent quesadilla but not impressive. We also ordered the seafood paella. There was a generous amount of seafood mixed in and the rice was flavorful. The sausages were a bit too salty and the chicken seemed so out of place (some chunks and shreds that seemed to just be tossed in as an unappetizing afterthought - what's it doing in seafood paella anyway?). All in all, I think it's worth visiting during happy hour to try some of their appetizers and drinks. Staff was super friendly.",

Then he went off on a tangent about how there was a miscommunication and we should not have been seated without menus. He is the definition of a low wage uneducated worker. So then i go to the bar and tell the bartender i want two drinks for me and my date (who looked better in her photos ) and he says he will let our server know because im in his section. I go off on the dude because i just want to get two drinks and carry them the 2 feet from the bar to the table right behind me, but he refused to do this cause it wasn't fair to the server. What a bunch of degenerates at this chain hell. The manager came over and eventually offered to buy me 2 drinks, but hell no because he defended his erver. Ended up walking out on my ugly date, who was sitting at the table wondering what the hell she should do and also this Bahama Breeze forever. Letter to corporate also sent, but a canned response was received. Punks.",

Service was speedy, both in seating and in getting our food.  Our server was Sam and she was quite pleasant and knowledgeable, even joking around with me after I made some of my usual sarcastic comments.  I had asked her what was good here and what she'd recommend and, when she told me, I said that I'd trust her and that it would be her fault if my dinner wasn't great...all the time with a smirk on my face.  It turns out that she was right.  One of her recommendations was the seafood paella.  It was the first time I'd had paella and it was awesome!  She asked me later on why I hadn't left her any so that she could have some dinner that night and I said that it was just too good to leave behind.  We both chuckled and she said she was glad to hear it.  The pina colada I had was really good, but stir it up first.  Most of the rum goes in first and is then swirled in with the rest of the drink which resembled a very thick milkshake's consistency.  Yum!  I can easily see myself returning to this restaurant the next time I'm in Vegas.",

The only reason I'm giving them four stars is because the service was pretty slow. It took foreeeever to get the check and then even longer to pay. But overall, very nice happy hour experience.

    "text": "I made a big deal to my wife that we had to go to Bahama Breeze this time while we were in Las Vegas.  We went Monday night and a lot of reviewers commented that the concept for the restaurant and it is terrific...it really is nice.  But for us, that was where it ended.  Our service was very good (Thanks Sparky!)  My wife had the curry chicken for dinner...it was so dry and lacked flavor she could not eat it.  She ordered a strawberry magarita and she got a mango margarita instead.  We sent it back and this time it came back with only a little mango in it.  WTF?  The bartender could not make a most simple drink?!?!  To top off our drink issues...The pour on the tequila had to have been a 1/2 ounce if that...it was like drinking mix only and then it was served in a martini glass!.  If you don't have margarita glasses put it in a hurricane glass, those they had..  I had the paella and a couple of beers...it was a safe bet .  My daughter had the jerk chicken pasta, again, just okay, kind of lackluster in flavor.  To drink, she ordered a Bailey's and coffee...served in a regular ol' coffee mug.  A place like this I would have expected a clear mug to showcase the drink...nope, didn't happen.  I know some of this may seem like petty things but...our bill was close to $100 for the 3 dinners, drinks oh...and an appetizer.  The entrees did not come with any type of salad offering either.  Over priced and the Monday night bartender(s) needs a bit work.  We did voice our comments to the manager (actually we were going to leave and our server sent the manager to us!).  He said he will talk to his staff and try to fix things.  He did give us 3 comp drink tickets to use anytime.  One thing we do not do is complain to the manager in order to get a comp meal, we usually will talk to the manager AFTER we pay.  Getting comp'd is not the point, bringing issues to management's attention so they can resolve the problem is the larger issue.",

See, I've been to this Bahama Breeze a couple times before, because I discovered it's a place I can get a bowl of some really yummy chicken tortilla soup, complete with freshly sliced cubes of avocado. And, it's certainly nice to dine in a restaurant void of video poker machines and giant flat screens displaying every single game you can bet on. The decor's nice -- they certainly did an excellent job of creating the outside indoors. The service, plain and simple, is just nothing to write home about. Or write about at all. Last night, I met up with a group of friends there for dinner, and they seated us on the patio. Why the patio was even open, I have no idea. Even with the heater towers, we were freezing. The hostess relocated us, and it took quite a while for our orders to be taken, and took days for our food to arrive, without so much as an explanation or apology. In fact, our server completely disappeared after our orders were taken. A food runner delivered our plates. I did notice, however, that the complaining stopped once we did receive our meals. The food certainly is pretty darn tasty, and the presentation impressive. I'm just going to convince myself that it's been the luck of the draw as far as service has gone on my previous experiences, and give it one more try.  Sure do love that soup. ,': )",

For the most part our server did her job well, but we received some drinks that were watered down. The food took a while to get to us but it was busy so that is understandable. What killed the night is my buddy pulling a 12 inch blonde hair out of his mouth while chewing his jerk pasta. Everyone's apatite was ruined after that.",

    "text": "We decided to avoid the craziness of the strip & come here for dinner last night, thinking it would be less busy. It was a lot less busy but very understaffed. We had to wait almost 40 min for a table for 4 at an almost empty restaurant. We were seated at around 10:30 pm.   To be fair - the food was not bad. What was most upsetting is that I ordered the rice bowl with shrimp & fish. A few bites in, I bit into something hard. I thought it was a fish bone but it was a sharp jagged piece of a plastic - probably the remnants of a food container about an inch long and wide. I told the server & she asked if I wanted my dish replaced and I said no as I did not want to wait for another plate at that time of night as our kids were very tired. She showed the plastic object to her manager & I was waiting to see what he/she would say or do. Well the disappointing outcome is they did nothing. No apology from the manager & we got charged for my dish. Very disappointing.    This is not the first time we have found unwelcome objects in our food at restaurants. In fact once at BJ's my sons Mac & Cheese had the corner of a plastic bag in it but we did not say anything as it was large enough to see & not harmful. The sever saw it as she collected the plates & reported it to the manager. She came to our table to apologize & said we would not be charged for the dish.   So to the manager of the Bahama Breeze - your management skills need some fine tuning to say the least. Your food quality control obviously needs some work. It's not OK to find sharp plastic objects in our food & it's especially not OK for you to ignore it. Very disappointing.",

Tasteless processed shrimp, fried chicken straight from the freezer bag, fake Caribbean food, obesity sized portions, to over bearing super enthusiastic waiter that just wants to sell sell sell... it was a disaster.  You could stick a knife in his gut and he would still smile and say that was the most thrilling fun he's had he ever had and then try to sell you a tasty signature yummy cocunut piss flavored drink.  For the first time ever, only half the food was eaten and doggie bags were clearly declined.  I felt so cheated, I honestly thought this was a non-chain, real caribbean restaurant.",

It's my job to choose our restaurants so as we drove by Bahama Breeze something made me say say \"stop, turn here!\" I'm glad we did.  It's your typical chain restaurant with oversized booths and waiters in tropical shirts, but we were both pleased with our meals and our friendly waiter. We had the beef empenada appetizer, the chicken kabob over yellow rice and the fresh jerk salmon of the day. The food was seasoned well and the menu has plenty to choose from without being overwhelming.   The food was reasonably priced for lunch and the portions were great, not too much food it was perfect. Our waiter was so sweet and even gave us a tip on a great place to go shopping! The tropical drinks looked great, so next time I visit I would like to try one.  It was a nice relaxing comforting lunch to end our fun trip in Vegas.",

The staff are great our waiter Fred came over within a minute of our sitting down and gave us a rundown of the best & most popular drinks & dishes since this was our first visit. My daughter that doesnt drink, loves strawberry lemonade and orders it whenever its on a menu, she says this was the best shes EVER had. All i can say is this place is now in my top 5 of places to have a great \"experience\" meal. To me, the prices are low for the quality & quantity of food we received, if it were more i wouldnt complain. We were so stuffed couldnt try dessert. They do have small plates so we might do that with drinks next time so that we can try those delicious looking desserts.",

Our only complaint is there are no BB in Arizona where we live!   I had a salmon tostado. Delicious with lots of greens on the tostado, topped with the salmon.  DH had fish tacos which he liked very much.  It was just before Mothers' Day and I had their special Mothers' Day cocktail. What a trip. They put Cotton Candy (yes) in a martini glass, and dropped some raspberries on it. Then, at our table, they shook together rum and fruit flavored liquors and poured them over the cotton candy (which melted)  It was very sweet and really fun to have.  Service was very helpful and friendly and time waiting for food was fine.",

I had coconut shrimp that was to die for (though only four, needed at least two more) and the house salad with the house dressing (very fancy, delicious salad). My companion had a jerk chicken sandwich and soup (can't remember what kind) he said was good. Lovely atmosphere (played island music) and nice wait staff. Lots of rum specialty drinks in the offerings, but since it was 90 degrees and we had to walk a bit, we didn't indulge. I'd go back for sure!",

The food was pretty good as always but the service was probably a 2 out of 10. Your server can make or break your experience and our server broke it. From our initial greeting to leaving it seemed she was going through the motions. I noticed other tables had a candle lit. Ours was unlit. I waited 15 minutes and finally lit it my self. Our server just did not want to give us the experience we deserved. Maybe our server was having a bad day or just tired as it was 8:30-9:30 pm. She just didn't smile or seemed enthused about serving us. I was also unhappy that they did not sing to my sister and charged 8 bucks for her birthday desert. I have never been charged before at any establishment. My Mojito was all ice. I think the bartender needs a lesson from Havana Grill in Henderson on a proper Mojito. Seafood Paella, wood fire chicken and burger were good but not great. I hope our next experience will be back to the standards we expect from Darden and especially Bahama Breeze.  UPDATE: The manager called me today 03/10/13 and offered to make it right.He also stated his first priority was to ensure that i will have a good experience...I want to thank the manager for the phone call and glad to see Bahama Breeze cares about the satisfaction of their costumers.......",

The side items were very good, and I did actually like the hummus but it needed more carribean kick in the flavor and not be so thin and bland.  I tried their new Shrimp and 4 cheese grits.  The dish was made perfect and so were the grits but again everything was bland. It needs more kick in the flavor dept.    The pineapple upside down chocolate cake was soooooooooo yummmy though.  Their seafood chowder is always good, and I've had their black beans and fish tacos many times and it is definitely yummmy.    I will definitely keep coming back to this place again.  I just prefer more spice/flavor in my dishes. (spice doesn't mean spicy, just fyi)",

The service was great as well. The waiter made sure our drinks never ran dry and that we had everything we needed and was very friendly. I got a sampler plate with empanadas, jerk chicken, and rice, and other yummy choices. Also tried the baby back ribs. Sooooooo good! I would love to try their seafood here.",

Our guest had Pork Medallions and Sweet Potatoes. She also ordered some Shredded Pork. It didn't agree with her. Has Bahama Breeze changed owners or is it just my imagination.",

Walking in, not a lot people here, about half full, we were seated and it was a while before our server showed up. She got our drink order and away she went.   We finally got our drinks and we placed our app order, we got the spinach dip and chips, spinach  with artichokes in a creamy cheese dip was good! We also got a nacho made with plantans, this was good and a bowl of seafood chowder, also good.   About here, I decided I wanted one of their specialty drinks so I picked out the blue hawaiian or something like that but after 25 minutes we had to ask for it again and when it came, tall skinny glass, I think maybe four sips and it was gone!   For main fair, I got the mahi mahi. It was good but our food and drinks took so long coming we both felt like leaving! My husband got the shrimp and cheesy grits, it was good.   Finally when she came to ask about dessert we just handed her the bank card and said bill please!",

The atmosphere was very nice.   The waiter took our drink order right away. Great selection of fancy drinks.   I had the Coconut Shrimp with extra broc instead of the rice. The Coconut Shrimp was outstanding. It came with 7 very large Shrimp and I could not eat them all.  Would be plenty large to split with someone else. It came with a salad that was good but nothing special.   The rest of my table had the Chicken that was served with mashed potatoes and corn. They all said it was very good. The serving was enormous and easily could be shared.   Overall a very good experience. I would eat here again. The atmosphere is casual, the service is good and efficient and the food was tasty.",

    "text": "I come here once every year...once out of curiosity and the rest I was forced to do so because I was threatened with a free meal. This place reminds me more of San Diego and not the Bahamas. Service here isn't consistent. Good servers, bad servers and the in-betweens. The food is quite average. I've had great meals when I went to Bahamas so I'd always hope they'd remind me of my trip. They have conch fritters but it's disappointing. I must say their drinks are pretty solid though. Here's some that I've tried:   Yaka Hula Hickey Dula: Riesling, pineapple juice and dark rum. I like pineapple/pineapple juice, I like Riesling, rum is ok. Nice fruity but strong drink. 5/5  Ultimate Pina Colada: Captain Morgan rum, strawberry and pineapple ice and dark rum. It's like drinking a smoothie - not much alcohol here. 4/5  Crispy Onion Rings: Large onions rings breaded with Panko and coconut flakes. The sauce is a sweet mustard...I'm not a fan. 2/5  Coconut Shrimp: Shrimps breaded with coconut flakes, citrus-mustard sauce on the side. This is supposed to be a best-seller. I'm still not a fan. 2/5  Beef Empanadas: Fried dough filled with beef and potatoes.  Comes with mango salsa and a dipping sauce. Forgettable. 2/5  Tostones with Chicken: Fried plantains with sweet peppers, mushrooms, chicken, cheese and tomato salsa. Biggest mistake and probably the worst item on the menu. I love tostones and this was a major let down. There's so much going on with this dish. 1/5  Shrimp Creole Bowl, Chicken Curry: Nothing to write home about. 2/5  Chicken Tortilla Soup: Chicken breast, tortilla strips, carrots, roasted corn, avocado and lime. This is my go-to menu item when I don't feel like wasting my calories. 4/5  Big Island: Chocolate mousse, brownie, milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. Chocolate mousse and vanilla anglaise are yummy...the brownie, not so much. 4/5  Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake: Warm chocolate cake with a pineapple ring on top and a molten chocolate center, raspberry sauce and fruits on the side. I love pineapple, I love chocolate but I do not love this dessert. If there's rum in this cake, it would've been delicious. 3/5  I've come here and have tried a lot of things on their menu but I just couldn't find anything that's good. I only come here for the liquid diet: soup and alcohol...and maybe the Big Island too. I'm just not in love with this place at all.",

I'm a big fan of their appetizers alone. During happy hour, all appetizers are half off so that's what my friends and I usually do. They also have a to-go menu for those on a tight schedule and wanna grab and go.   This is to get an idea of their schedule: Store Schedule // Sunday - Saturday: 11AM - 12AM Happy Hour // Monday - Friday: 4PM - 6PM Late Night Happy Hour // Sunday - Thursday: 9PM - 12AM  Happy Hour includes these appetizers to much on (and the portions are pretty big): -Beef Empanadas -Firecracker Shrimp -Chicken Quesadilla -Firecracker Shrimp Street Tacos  -Pork Carnitas Street Tacos  -Adobo Chicken Street Tacos  -Lobster & Shrimp Quesadilla  -Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp  -Coconut Shrimp -Jumbo Lump Crab Stack  -Warm Spinach Dip and Chips  -Jamaican Chicken Wings Tostones with Chicken  -Crispy Onion Rings  -Habanero Chicken Wings  SO MUCH VARIETY HONESTLY. GOOD PRICE FOR GREAT QUALITY!  The place is clean, especially their bathroom, and I've heard their drinks are pretty amazing (they also have hand-crafted drinks for happy hour).  I recommend this place if you're hungry at night and looking for something cheap for big amounts to fill you up! Also, just go to their happy hour!",

I ordered \"taste of Jamaica\", jerk chicken pasta, curry goat  bowl, beef empanadas, and the chocolate island. The service was good. There wasn't a wait and we were seated immediately. The only thing I disliked was the plantains. They were too sweet and tasted just like bananas, which I also dislike. I cannot wait to return.",

Went there to celebrate my mother's and niece's birthday. the restaurant was lively, bright and inviting. On  One side of the restaurant it appears that they were setting up a live band. But we got seated on the opposite side of the restaurant so I did not get to experience that. I told the waiter that we were celebrating 2 birthdays. The 1st thing he told me was we don't offer a free dessert but you and more than welcome to purchase. O...k..Never in my life has any restaurant  Ever said that to me .   The menu was filled with options. May be a little too much. Multiple multiple tropical drink selections but I still ended up ordering just a plain old red stripe beer. As a Jamaican family, we had high hopes. We hoped that they had changed their recipe from many years ago and was excited to order mostly Jamaican items. Beef empanada ( ) . I'm assuming their version of a beef patty....nope.  Oxtail nope , mutton..nope.  No rice and peas. ! No spice ! Sigh...  Not for me.  The lobster shrimp quesadilla was nice though",

We had a party 13 reserved for a birthday, but there wasn't a table ready, nor was there a table big enough to have our party sit together. So we were split into two tables. I ordered a applewood bacon and cheese burger, it came with no bacon or cheese. They did get the no onion correct though. When I informed the server about my burger, she didn't take my burger back, but later brought me a plate with a piece of cheese and bacon melted on it! And said, \"this is hot.\" Another one in our party had hair in his. Yet another ordered a salad that was supposed to come before the meal but came after the main portion. I would NOT recommend this restaurant.",

Not too loud music, or bright lights, or busy. The hostess was very kind and helped us get seated promptly (went around 9pm). Overall our stay wasn't horrible, nor too great. For the cons, they're only 2; upon getting our food selections, the portion was way too small or the price was way high. All dishes are approximately $20, not including tax or tip. I get this is a mid-tier restaurant, but I was hoping for a section with smaller portions that's backed up with a smaller price. Granted, there is a \"half portion\" option for most food items, but it's only $2/$3 cheaper...my rationale was might as well get the full portion. Best bang for your buck. Also, number two, our waiter never checked up on us until we had to flag him down just to get our check and let him know that we were ready to leave. Nevertheless the atmosphere is wonderful and the food is delicious. If you can overlook that most of the food is on the pricier side for what you're given, then give this place a shot for big gatherings.",

So, me and some friends were looking to have a GREAT margarita since it was Cinco De Mayo (you know being in the spirit of the 'holiday'.  We found ourselves at Bahama Breeze, to to grab a drink or two and listen to the band.  I'm glad we went, it's always the nights that are NOT planned that you have the MOST fun.  We seat ourselves at the outside bar, there was an island band playing that night.  FYI: There's a live band every Friday...ok, so at the bar get the menu and see that they have a special for the night $5 Margaritas (Mango, Classic, Strawberry and 2 other flavors).  6 Margaritas and a chicken quesadilla later we were SAUCED and that's when the night got live.  The band was cool, it was a Caribbean themed band that week.    This review is not about the food or the band, even though BOTH were great, this review is about the BARTENDER LUIS @ the outside.  Out of this world customer service, he was definitely in charge of his bar that night.  Not only assisting in making the drinks for the servers, he still maintained a great quality of service that he provided to us at the bar.  Very attentive to all, even took a moment to crack a joke or two with the folks at the bar.  I LOVE service like this, it makes me come back on the regular.  I will definitely be back soon, no need to wait for the hostess to seat, I walking straight to the outside bar to go hang with LUIS!  Go visit him, he's really cool.  I promise this is not personal review, I did not know Luis until last week.  Good thing I was looking for a great margarita because I found one and it was accompanied by an AWESOME person/bartender.",

I arrived about 5:15 and was seated in a rather empty restaurant except for a private party in one room.  I was seated immediately and my server, Mike, came over and ask for drink order and let me know if I had any questions about the menu to ask.  He got my iced tea.  I ordered a cup of black bean soup and the coconut shrimp.  The bean soup was brought in a short time drizzled with a back and forth with a cilantro-crema.  The crema didn't really give the soup any flavor.  It seems it was more decorative than functional.   The main course--coconut shrimp--was brought with the correct amount of break between appetizer and main.  The shrimp were good and it had been quite awhile since I had coconut shrimp which I like.  It was served broccoli and yellow rice.  The shrimp were good but I think it would be better as an appetizer than a main.    For dessert, I got the chocolate island, a dessert the menu describes as \"rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie island in chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise.\"  It was a very good dessert and the best part of the meal.  Mike's service was very good.  My iced tea was refilled without asking.  Bahama Breeze was an OK place.",

    "text": "Located next to the Marriott Residence Inn. If you're a patron of the hotel, you can get 25% at this restaurant which is why I'm giving this place 4 vs. 3 stars. Cute, chill, island ambiance. Good service. Just missed the mark with the food. Crabstack- so, the wording \"premium crab\" got me salivating. Sadly, both the shrimp and crab we're tasteless and you can taste that it was probably defrosted as the shrimp was a bit soft. The mango and avocado added to it was the best part.  Stuffed plantain bowl- we requested adobo chicken instead of beef. Mixed with rice , beans, onion, peppers, mushroom, rice, etc. It had a good flavor, but we could've done without the onions and peppers. Key lime pie- definitely tart which is why they have a thick layer of meringue on top to offset the tartness which I didn't really care for. I liked the berry and passionfruit(?) Sauces on the side to eat the pie with.",

A very substantial portion, by the way. Will definitely bring more people to this place as it does deliver the Bahama Breeze experience.",

I made a reservation a couple days ahead, for myself and a few of my girlfriends. I was just a little disappointed that they didn't have the Reggae band playing.   Overall the service was outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive & efficient.  Now to the delicious food. Here's what we opted for: Taste of Jamaica -  Awesome jerk pork, jerk chicken, beef empanada, callaloo, sweet plantains, white rice and black beans. Respek the flavor. Love, loved it.  My very favorite is the Lobster & Shrimp quesadillas. This is a must try. There's no other like it. Two thumbs up! Caribbean style lobster Mac&Cheese -  Lightly fried lobster tail with Bahamian mac & cheese. AMAZING!   Drinks Goombay Smash - very strong but good.  Yaka Hula - Bacardi Black Rum, pineapple juice for a tropical tribute to Island romance. This sweet cocktail was inspired by a Hawaiian love song. Excellent drink. One of my favorites. Pineapple Coconut martini- This is one Sexy drink. Loved it.  My fellow yelpers, I would not steer you wrong, if you're tired of buffet food, fancy expensive hotel dining, come to Bahama Breeze. Prices are very reasonable. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. I will always be a returning customer.",

I love the jerk chicken pasta! The jerk seasoning is very close to the flavor I have had while in Jamaica. It has a creamy alfredo type sauce with bow tie pasta. They also have amazing cocktails.  The mojitos are deliciously made with fresh fruit. But be careful, these drinks are strong! For the non alcoholic side, try the strawberry lemonade. It comes hand made, fresh and delicious!",

But 3 strikes for me is enough however.  Trying to book this has been the worst experience of planning our entire Vegas wedding. We have been put on hold for 10/20 min a time only to get someone that can't help us, doesn't want to help us, nor doesn't seem like they have any interest in working with us. Rude, don't care, unhelpful, constant runaround. Not a problem, we'll take the business of 25 guest we were going to come in with and enjoy food and drinks elsewhere. A little foolish on their end if you ask me... good luck with that attitude",

It was a generous portion cooked in a savory broth with plenty of spice and diced tomatoes on top. Hubby enjoyed his ribs with a tasty and unique sauce.

Drinks: Frozen Bahamarita - delicious Ultimate Pina Colada - just OK. I wish it was in a bigger class  For an appetizer I had the Adobo Chicken Taco. It was good. I liked how it had a little crunchiness to it. It was a little cold though  My entree was the Island Hopper and included onion rings, conch fritters, coconut shrimp, and Jamaican jerk wings.  I ate half an onion ring, nothing special about those since I cannot stand the taste of onions. The conch fritters should really be called conch balls. I love fried conch from this local place in Miami so that was the main reason why I decided to go with this meal, I was disappointed. They were not horrible but could have been seasoned more and they barely had any conch in them. The coconut shrimp was standard though most of the seasoning was on the outside and not the shrimp itself. Being Jamaican I always go for things that are jerked. These wings were not jerked at all. No spice or kick to them. The sauces that came with the food were soooo good!!!  For desert I had the Banana Nut Bread Supreme. It was delicious. The only negative was the stale, warm, soggy banana slice.  I will definitely be returning",

I wasn't even hungry and I almost finished my big ass plate of Calypso Shrimp Linguine. Might I add that they use 'Gulf Shrimp' in their shrimp dishes, which if you don't already know ,are not not small shrimp. My wife had the Wood Grilled Tilapia, my son had the Wood Grilled Chicken and my sister had the Jerk chicken and every single one of their dishes were excellent. For appetizers we had the Artichoke dip and the Jerk Shrimp, again both delicious.   So the next time you're in Vegas, get out of your fancy hotel and treat yourself out to something different and worth your money!",

My wife and I each choose a different fresh fish which came with rice or mashed potatoes and green beans.  We specifically asked to have our veggies cooked and not served crunchy like so many restaurants serve.   The meal did not come with soup nor salad not even bread.  We asked about bread but was told we could order a loaf for extra charge.  I did added a side lobster tail for an extra $9.99.   When our meal came the green beans were not cooked hardly at all.  They did offer to bring more.  Our mash potatoes were warm but not hot.  The fish was good but not great and they forgot my side lobster tail.  The manager came over and apologized which was nice but did not offer anything other than his apology.  I would have declined a free dessert but that would have been appropriate. I have eaten here before and it was better but will probably not go back for a while.",

It's a casual, family style restaurant and not really somewhere you would like to take someone out on a date if you are looking for something quiet to converse because it's pretty loud inside. It's pretty huge inside also, but I don't know how busy this place usually gets.  I doubt you need to call for reservations unless you're planning to come with a big group.  I ordered the coconut shrimp and calamari.  Pretty good but I can't tell you about the other dishes since this is the only one I ordered.  But I'm sure if you come in a big group, you'll end up trying other stuff also.",

I would prefer more of the roasted corn. The combination of the cilantro cream and corn work very well together. The Chicken wings are quite good as well.

There were only a few people in the place and it took them over 15 minutes to sit us. Then it took them more than 20 minutes to get someone to get outer drink orders. No one even spoke to us during that entire time. People were walking past us, but no one even noticed that five people were sitting at a table in the middle of the room. When some one finally did speak to us, she did not know much about the menu items. It took us three hours (that's right, you read that right) to get out of that place! Never again. They may have been short staffed, but I can't believe they would be that rude and ignore their customers. No excuse for this.",

They have a great selection of beers and cocktails in the happy hour! No wonder this place was soooo busy! They also have a great selection of appetisers half price so we choose the massive Crispy Onion rings! they were huge and so tasty!!! For the mains i had the Jerk Chicken pasta which was good!!! And my partner had the one of the Burgers which was also huge! The portions here are not small so come on a empty stomachl!! The whole place was buzzing and had a great feel to the place and it was nice to escape from the Strip for a while, They also have live entertainment on some nights including some great Reggae and Caribbean tunes so you can just pretend youre in the Caribbean. If youre planning on taking a visit here  from the Strip i would recommend taking a taxi as it is a bit of a walk and the area can be a little sketchy.",

The hostess greeted us right away and there was no wait when we arrived around 5pm on a Sunday. We were looking forward to live music but the musician didn't arrive until we were having dessert.  Service was great. Food was good. The jerk chicken wings and conch fritters came with really good sauces. The chicken adobo street tacos weren't the best. It had a lot of guacamole (I love guac) and it had Crispy tortilla strip at the bottom but there was barely any meat. We ended with a rum cake, which was pretty good. We ordered the Bahamarita cocktail and the sangria. Sangria tasted horrible even after they added more juice to it.  They have a happy hour during the week where they have discounted cocktails and half - off most of their appetizers. We will probably end up going back during happy hour to try the other appetizers.",

Lol  The waiter was very good, I had friends in town from France and he made them feel very welcomed  Serving them first which I thought was just EXTRA !! ;)   I will be back, and when I get visitors in town, even though this is 18 miles away (in Vegas there's a bazillion restaurants) this is the one we head to. And all my friends love it as much as I do   Nice Ambiance, my only suggestion is to train their staff better  When you check in at the door each time the staff of 3 that are there look overwhelmed and confused....  pretty much every time I go there however, they also informed me there's usually a 2 hour wait for a table, so I guess you can't blame them for feeling overwhelmed   Cocktails and are very good, and in comparison to other establishments here in Vegas near the strip, these prices are very reasonable",

Overall, the food is OK, nothing really has ever been mind blowing and nothing has ever been a fail. We like to come here because the restaurant is spacious with a laid back island feel and atmosphere. Service has never been an issue either and we have sat in all areas including the main dining area, the bar area, and in the indoor patio area.  The firecracker shrimp street tacos, the Jamaican chicken wings, and the ahi tuna stack are pretty decent starters. The whole wing is served as the appetizer so be ready to share. For entrees, the paella and the steak oscar have been satisfactory. But the last few visits I have ordered something from the fresh fish menu.  Our last visit was on a Saturday night and we sat in the indoor patio area. They had a gentleman playing live music for our entire stay. The music did not drown out our conversation, but you should request another seat if you would like a more peaceful environment.   For drinks, we had the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula and the Painkiller. Both cocktails were strong but nice mixes with kick from the rum. They were too strong for my wife, so that meant two dinner cocktails for me. I had the sauteed tilapia with chimichurri sauce as my entree. My wife had a turkey burger. My fish was cooked perfectly, moist and flaky with the chimichurri being a nice accompaniment. For dessert, the chocolate pineapple upside down cake was enjoyed by both of us.  As long as Bahama Breeze continues to be consistent, we will keep coming back.",

Seeing that the closest location was the one in Vegas, we saved the gift card for our trip to the Strip.  Walking in this place was like entering into a different world. It was amazing. They don't commit to theme so blatantly like Rainforest Cafe or places like that, but in a natural and organic way where it still feels homey.   The lady who sat us down spent a couple minutes explaining to us what she liked best on the menu. Then, our waiter, Eamon, got over to us and he, too, gave us his take on the menu, breaking down each section, since he knew we had never been there before.   I'm the type of guy that likes to get what's popular at any restaurant, so he informed me that the Jerk Chicken was their best item.   I was hesitant about it, because jerk chicken has not really ever been my style. But with risk comes reward, and this reward was worth it.  The meal ($17) came with three large pieces of bone-in chicken, black beans, rice, and plantains. The chicken was some of the most moist I've ever eaten, and the spices on the chicken loaded it with some amazing flavors without ever being too spicy. You'll definitely remember the taste more than the spiciness. The black beans were probably the best I've had. And the plantains were great (if you like plantains), especially when dipped in the Caribbean salsa that they put there on the plate. The rice was a little too saffrony for me and I wasn't a big fan, but my fiancee loved it.  She ordered the Skillet Jerk Shrimp ($12), which was amazingly tasty! It was jam-packed with flavor, and came with a garlic-thyme butter sauce that I couldn't stop dipping the bread in (her dish came with a roll of bread).   Altogether, this place will now be a mainstay on our trips into town, much like the Peppermill has become. The waiter was amazing and so was all of the food and the atmosphere. The prices, also, were very reasonable--especially considering what town we were in.",

The food has gone downhill since the last time I've eaten here. Menu looks FABULOUS, great photos, but the food tasted freezer burn/from a box and bland. Very unexpected and disappointing. I literally lost my appetite after trying my dish, it was a rice bowl with mahi and shrimp. So NASTY! I recommend the chicken quesadilla instead, those are tasty. The environment was nice but out dated, I feel it is due for a remodel. When we sat down the dining room was very hot, I noticed many people outside on the patio but I prefer eating indoors. It seemed like they turned off the AC since customers weren't sitting inside(weird). I would give it a try again but stay inside my box and only order items that are safe and hard to ruin. The cocktails and drinks looked great.",

We got there just in time for a GREAT happy hour. We all ordered the pineapple coconut martini. It was the best!! And then got 2 orders of the best coconut shrimp I have ever had. Loved the crunch and the coconut was cooked perfect. The dipping sauce made it taste even better.   We then ordered a bunch of apps and they were all delish too. We also ordered the coconut mojitos. It was like a dessert. Sooooo good.   But our servers Jarrod and Raven made our night even better. They took such great care of us!! They were just amazing. They really know their stuff.   I just wish Bahama Breeze was in California. I have to come all the way to Las Vegas to eat there.",

You walk in and definitely get the vibe of being in the Bahamas.  Fresh water flowing, tropical decor everywhere and many choices of rum mixed drinks with flavors that bring you back to paradise at sea.  Items Ordered: - Firecracker Shrimp (Appetizer) - Jerk Chicken Fettucini (Entree)  My initial appetizer was quite good and I'm not sure what the sauce was made from, but it was very flavorful.  Was definitely in the caliber for bang bang shrimp from Bonefish Grill.  The jerk chicken Fettucini definitely had a nice kick after each bite and made my taste buds crave more.  The portions for both entree and appetizer were extremely generous and I'm so glad I split my meal with my wife.  I really wanted to try the pineapple mixed drink, but unfortunately I was in working hours.  I'd definitely like to come back for happy hour and try other items on the menu.",

There's a very diverse drink menu for anyone's needs. The Bahamarita is the way to go in my opinion. After two or three, you can't really feel your face. They have an awesome menu as well that has something for just about everyone. My girlfriend never orders anything but the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Pasta, which comes in a huge portion that can be shared or taken home for a second meal. I myself love the Steak Oscar, which is an 8 oz sirloin topped with buttery crab meat. How can you beat that?! They also have a great happy hour for those who are lucky enough to work close to the Strip but luckily, there is a reverse happy hour that starts at 9 as well.",

My drink was basically a slushy with shot of tequila on the side , I had to drink some of the slush in order to get the tequila to fit in the glass .. Knowing how many ppl were there they only had two servers and one bus boy .. You could tell the girls were over whelmed and it showed in their service and attitude..

We come to town about 3-4 times a year for a extended weekend, and Bahama Breeze has always been our most anticipated stops. Something went astray this time.  I ordered my usual ( Cuban Black Bean Soup, and Jerk Chicken Wings), my wife ordered the Portabella Mushroom Burger.  When he explained it was a hamburger, with a mushroom on top, my wife requested just a \"burger\" made with the Portabella mushroom as the burger.  I guess the special request was just to complicated.  First she got a open faced bun with a mushroom and veggie mix on it.  She requested the same thing again, and this time it came out as she requested, at about the start of the second bite, a small black bug crawled out from under the lettuce and casually walked across the corner of her sandwitch.  We called the waiter, pointed out the intruder, and he promptly took it back. He then asked us if we wanted any desert.  We didn't quite understand the question, so we said no.  He brought us our bill.   We didn't understand.  My wife had had nothing to eat at this point.  We didn't ask for anything else we just thought he would replace her un-eaten sandwich.  The manager did come over and apologize, and told us how sorry he was, but her sandwich was not replaced.   As we were leaving, I told the hostess the story, she hailed the manager who apologized again, but didn't seem to understand when I explained that my wife was leaving your establishment Hungary.  People shouldn't leave a restaurant Hungary.   Not sure if we will try again, just kinda sad that our favorite place, now has a scar.",

I absolutely love their bathrooms...I feel bathrooms say a lot about a restaurant. They were very clean, nicely decorated, full size doors for every stall, big size stalls, and they have mouth wash with individual cups so you can be minty fresh as you leave.  The food:  Lobster and Shrimp Quesadilla- It was good but I imagined something different so it was tasty but I felt it was missing a bit more flavor. Glad I tried it but I'll probably go with something else next time.  Seafood Chowder- That was delicious, had a good amount of shrimp and vegetables and was creamy, I loved it.  Cobb Salad- It was big and came with the usual fixings but I've had better cobb's in my life.   Coconut Shrimp- Mmm...mmm...mmm...a must if you eat at this restaurant. Perfectly fried and packed with flavor.  Chocolate Pineapple Cake- I don't like chocolate but I do love pineapple and this dessert called to me. It was warm, rich, and melted in my mouth. I suggest sharing because it's very decadent...I needed a glass of water when I finished.   They have a large menu so there's something for everyone and they have a good selection of tropical alcoholic drinks.",

I was a little skeptical because I've never eaten at a Caribbean restaurant before but the food here is so so good!!! The waitress that we had was amazing as well, she was so funny and genuine. I would definitely recommend this place, and I can't wait to eat here again!",

    "text": "My family and I really enjoyed our first visit to Bahama Breeze. I have been meaning to try it for some time. We went in on a Saturday afternoon and they were not too busy. The food was pretty good, but the best part of the visit was the staff. When we first walked in, one of the servers walked up to my kids who were looking and the fountain and pulled two pennies out of his own pocket for them to throw into the fountain. When we were first sat it took a couple minutes for our waiter to come to the table and two of the other servers (who had just gotten off) noticed and without us having to ask went and found our server. Our server was also very friendly and did a great job. My family and I will definitely be returning to this restaurant in the future.",
