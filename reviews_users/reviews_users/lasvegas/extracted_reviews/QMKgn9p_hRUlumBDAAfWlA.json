    "text": "Sorry guys I had to hit you with a one star!!!! First off the staff is friendly. They were super attentive and made sure we had what we needed!   Onto the food! Hands down I've had way better! The adobo fried rice didn't even taste like adobo fried rice! It had no flavor and it didn't even come out hot. For me my very first disappointment was the lechon roll. I was super excited to try it however as we were flipping through the menu it clearly stated that it needed to be ordered a day in advanced.... it's great that it comes fresh however super disappointing for people who yelp search restaurants and don't get to try what they hope to try! Lastly the tip of the ice berg for me was the ube souffle, I'm a huge ube fan and from my experience with eating souffle that cutting boards souffle was wayyyyyyyyyyy under cooked! It was watery mushy and really wasn't that flavorful! Most likely won't be coming back and for us that sucks! We love Filipino food and being that it's close to our house we were in hopes that we found us a new spot but clearly not!!!! Sorry cutting board!",

    "text": "If you are unfamiliar with Filipino cuisine, this is a great place to get initiated. Stopped in for a quick beer while killing time and decided to bring the whole family back for dinner that night. I love the sweet chili sauce for the calamari. We also had chicken and pork fried rice, chicken adobo, lettuce cups, and a crispy tender beef that came bone-in. Everything was delicious and the lumpianitas were addictive. The star of the meal, however was the souffle dessert that is well worth the approx. 20 min prep time (so order it when you order everything else).  The owners were incredibly accessible and gracious, and all the staff we interacted with really made us feel at home. At one point the chef came out to say hello to guests, which gave us a chance to compliment him firsthand.  The beer and other alcohol choices make this a great \"pub\" option if no time for a meal. Most of all, I can't believe how affordable everything is for the level of quality, preparation, and taste. So glad this place is in our neighborhood and can't wait to try it again!",

My wife and I had Fish balls and Chicken skewers off thier 'Street Food' appetizers.  Nice portions and great taste.  I had the Lechon Roll, which is Paella rice rolled into a nice piece of pork, baked then broiled. The exterior was so nice and crispy while the meat is tender and juicy. What a combo of textures, it put me into heaven.  My wife had the Chicken Inasal which came with a side of mango salad. Great tender chicken and the pickled mango salad was awesome.  Tyn was our waitress who was marvelous. Her attention to us was incredible even though the restaurant was packed!",

    "text": "The place was okay. Really nothing to rave about. I was really excited because i like gastropubs. But I really dont think you can hipster-ize/fuse filipino food. Atmosphere was pretty cool. We went when it opened at 4pm and there were about 4 other parties already there. A little confusing but the door sign said they were open at 10am? I dont even know. They had a food blogger/critic event and our food looked nothing like theirs.  We were given the menu.. Which were 2 pieces of paper on a chopping board. Yes, its creative but heavy and bulky. Ordered a few things.   2 beers- beer is beer.   Oxtail kare kare- im not too fond of peanut-based food. But this was okay to me. My friend said it was pretty good. The veggies that it came with.. It was simple yet they were the best part.  Fish balls- tasted authentic!  Fried calamari- this was pretty good too!  Lechon kawali- reviewers said it was pretty oily.. Ours was a little bit on the dry side. But still pretty good.   Beef steak- oh man. This was a major fail. Ive had filipino beef steak before so i know how it should taste like. It was so strong, it tasted like someone used the darkest soy sauce they had. I had to eat it with a mouthful of rice and i still couldn't. Needless to say, we asked them to take it back. They were nice enough to take it off our tab and comp a dessert. This dish came out 10 mins after our other food.   White rice & java rice- get the java rice.. They give way more.   Bibingka souffle- i didnt touch the egg slice that came with it. But damn this was good! It came out hot and fresh. Poured the coconut topping and everything melts in your mouth!  Turon with ice cream- could have used a little more sugar, but otherwise okay.   Our waitress was great though. Dishes are \"family size\" but theyre pretty small.",

But we both tried it and even he liked the way they made it picked style. It was really good. It was served with the Loganisa sausage. Yum!!! A lil diamond in the ruff. If they had a better location this place would be jam pack all the time. Worth checking out to see for ur self!!! If u want to try classy Filipino u gotta try this place it's not to fancy and ur typical or 3 choice type place, a nice change to where we normally go. It's got a nice flare and everyone was nice. We went to try the awesome looking bibingka souffle or the ube version but they didn't have it so we tried the turon A La Mode and we were pleasantly surprised, wasn't what we came for but glad we tried it cuz was good. I will take my family here when they come to town and I don't take my family to just anywhere.",

So first the food, crab fried rice, it's a trick for customers, there were no crabs in the fried rice at all, what it is it's fried rice with food coloring and green peas u will never taste or eat crab on their fried rice! DO NOT ORDER it! They do this so u can pay more for rice! Fried shrimp is crispy and good, banana plantains burnt! No flavor, their tofu sisig is swimming in OIL!!! And so for their sisig tacos swimming in OIL, to the point that the tacos are wet and floppy! Bibingka souffle overrated! Nothing is good about this dessert. No flavor and the egg is like one piece and so tiny u can't taste it no flavoring. Staff is horrible! Waited for my dessert 30 mins after dinner even though I ordered them ahead of time, no water, our drinks were never refilled like our soda, no ice water for us so u can choke! I tip generously but these servers does not deserve 1$. They have a lot of food on their menu that's not available. What kinda of restaurant is that. No personality on the chef. When we came there were no customers at all. We ate there and the resto is empty! Now I know why. Their trash outside and shopping carts are visible. And that's not acceptable! It shows how dirty and unsanitary the restaurant is. This establishment does not deserve one !!!",

As we parked there were bits of glass which looked like smashed car window glass in the parking lot and the front door of the restaurant was also shattered. Doesn't give good vibes seeing that as you walk in. There were two large family sized tables of people in there with a few other tables that were full but eerily the whole place was kinda quiet. Service was good and we think it was the owner who was our server. On her suggestion we got the bone marrow, also ordered the pancit noodles, the souffle and some drinks. The lychee mojito was yum and so was the bone marrow. Noodles were good but wouldn't order again and souffle....oh  man the souffle... To my recollection there is no description of the souffle on the menu but we kept seeing people ordering them so we say hey! we like calories! let's order that too! We waited..and waited and waaaaited. Finally our server came over to say the oven was acting up and they wanted to make it perfect for us. We waited for over 30 mins I'm sure... at least we had fast and furious to watch on the tv screens. Souffle has salty egg, some cheese thing and some other thing. We were instructed to make a hole, throw them in and stir like crazy. Needless to say it was the oddest thing in our mouth. We souffle not ever again. Went to the bathrooms and like the outside it was just too ghettoriffic for me. Odd sewage type liquid on the floor, broken door handle and more! So overall a very big maybe.",

    "text": "Since we came as a big group, I was able to sample bits and pieces from what the others ordered.  Lumpianitas Sadly I didn't get to try this, but from the general consensus of the group, it was tasty. Prefect little bites for everyone to share. And great presentation too. Always was a sucker for little fry baskets. And the large cutting board it was served on, now I get the name of the place lol.  Grilled Hamachi Collar I'm a sucker for grilled Hamachi. No matter where I go, I will order it if I see it is on the menu. Parts of it were well seasoned and the others were just too salty for my taste (and I'm normally a salt fiend). I had to get to the most inner part of the collar just to get away from the saltiness. As for the mango salad that was covering part of the hamachi, I'm torn about it. It was light and refreshing but when I got to the dressing part, it was just very tart. If they can find the right balance on seasoning, I would've enjoyed this dish more.  Calamansi Juice Very light and refreshing. I will endure the sugar rush from this drink. So well worth it, especially during this summer.  Bone Marrow First off, I just want to say \"Damn! That's one huge bone!\" If they can keep it consistent, I will definitely get this. The group agreed that the garlic bread that accompanies this dish over powers the marrow itself. With all of that fat, a little bit of acidity helped it out (took the lemon wedge from my hamachi and squeezed it on the marrow).  Gambas and Longganisa al Ajillo Their take on sausage and peppers was pulled off nicely. Just straight forward sauteed prawns, peppers, onions, and longganisa. A little bit too oily (from the longganisa and olive oil combo), but very good. I would definitely order this again. And be forwarned, it doesn't say it in the descriptor but this dish contains jalapenos. So be prepared for a nice little kick!  Seafood Paella in Black Squid Ink Seafood was cooked nicely. Seasoning was on point. However, the major downfall was the rice. It's one of those things you dread, very crunchy rice in a paella dish. I don't like spitting things out on the table but definitely not edible.   Tamarind Honey Baby Back Ribs Great balance between the tart tamarind and honey. Not too sweet. Just a little bit flat. As for the ribs itself, it was okay. Could've gone a little bit longer in the oven but the meat was tender enough.  Crispy Tadyang Out of the dishes I sampled, this one stood out the most. Almost perfect. Crispy on the outside, moist and tender on the inside. As you bite in to it, the meat practically falls apart it was that tender. Even with the sauce that comes on the side, I think the meat could've endured a little bit more seasoning, but other than that, this was one of the dishes I enjoyed the most.  Chicken Inasal (Not Pictured) The only problem with this dish was the grilled chicken was on the grill a little bit longer than it should've been. The meat was very dry / overcooked. The soy sauce / vinegar / lemon that accompanied it was the best part of the dish, but even then it didn't help out the chicken at all. It just accentuated how dry it was.  Crispy Lechon Kawali The second dish I enjoyed was this! Perfectly crispy skin. How I missed you! It was accompanied by their liver sauce/sweet chili (very reminiscent of Mang Tomas mixed with thai sweet chili sauce). I suggest getting a side of the dipping sauce from the Chicken Inasal! Yum!   Bibingka Souffle  This dish was very impressive as it hit the table,  but for me and the group it fell flat (no pun intended). The souffle itself was the problem. There was just no flavor at all. Two of the three (I didn't get a chance to taste the third) was just too \"eggy\" tasting. Literally it felt like we were eating a soft egg white scramble. Sadly, we were informed by my friend's co-worker (?) from the next table that their server informed them that for the souffle, that the guest is to mix the salted egg, cheese, and the sauce before eating it... however, no amount of us mixing in the accompaniments would've salvaged the dish from tasting like an egg white scramble.  With most of the food review out of the way,  now comes the FOH service part. I understand the restaurant just opened up, but it does seem bad when your server walks away from you as you're still placing an order for appetizers.   A pet peeve of mine is not getting my water refilled. That's a reason why I order more than one beverage that way if one runs out, I still have another without having to flag down the server. 4 of our guests didn't get their water until after everyone else received their alcoholic drink orders.  To cut this review/rant short, I will wait for the FOH and BOH to get their bearings and then come back and give them another try. #supportlocalbusiness",

My friends and I love food and this was the newest place we wanted to try as we live for Filipino food!   The place was completely remodeled, very nice and open with 6 big screen TVs! Perfect for watching the games, date nights, and family dinners and other celebrations. The decor was classic and the atmosphere was pleasant.   The wait staff was extremely kind and helpful.  The portions were family size and me and my friend shared everything! We ordered the following:  Pancit Bami - $9 Chicken, shrimp, sausage and vegetables - Delicious! Cooked to perfection. Served hot! Huge portion. So good placed an order to go for my brother.   Lumpianitas - $7 Ground pork & vegetables rolled up. Deep fried till golden brown - The <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a>. I loved them so much I had an order to go.   Crab Mac & Cheese Beer chili sauce with orecchiette parmesan crust- Great! If you love seafood and cheese as I do this hit the spot.   They even take to go orders. I'll be back soon as I can.",

    "text": "You never really hear \"Filipino\" and \"gastropub\" in the same sentence, so you could imagine my curiosity when I saw that there was a gastropub that focuses on Filipino cuisine. I brought two of my friends with me to enjoy the modern twist to my culture's food. I honestly believe that this is a great concept, but they do have problems with execution & a lot of hiccups in their service.  Let's start with the drinks. I ordered the Calamansi Crush, which is made with: lemongrass vodka, elderflower liqueur, ginger, and calamansi  juice. I must admit, it was very refreshing. They did forget, however, to garnish the drink. It was missing the lime wedge element, which I usually like to squeeze the juice into my drink and muddle the wedge in a little. Their Monsoon Sweet Tea was nothing special. It tasted exactly like a Twisted Tea. Weak and not worth ordering. My friend ordered a Lychee Mojito, but our waitress failed to let her know that they were completely out of it until everyone else in my party received their drinks and the appetizer was dropped. Not good.   Our waitress should've known ahead of time which items on the menu were 86'ed for that night's service, or notified us sooner before the appetizers and other drinks hit the table.  My appetizer was the bone marrow. This was two halves of a big bone (marrow exposed) roasted in compound butter & herbs. It's served with bite-sized slices of garlic bread on the side that had a balanced ratio of garlic and butter, only to be complemented by the perfect crunchy texture. You can put the savory marrow on these slices of bread or you could be like me, and enjoy it with a side of garlic rice. The marrow was basically rich like butter & will leave your tastebuds wanting for more. Probably my favorite out of everything I ordered.  For my entree, I went with the seafood paella in squid ink. I've heard of squid ink pasta, but not squid ink paella so this was a very interesting choice for me. The squid ink added a slight saltiness to the dish. Its sea-like flavor definitely went well with the other seafood components, although it was pretty thick and soupy when I got to the bottom of the bowl. The garlic aioli and lemon wedges helped cut back on some of the saltiness. This dish was alright. Our waitress didn't bring this with everyone else's entree, so I was basically sitting there with nothing while my friends were already halfway through their meals. So disappointing.  The grilled bangus (milkfish) was a great switch up from the traditional fried bangus. The slaw on top had a pungent vinegar taste (but not too strong) that traditionally goes well with Filipino fish dishes, especially fried ones. The fish itself was soft & cooked well, albeit a little flavorless.  Finally, for dessert, we ordered the bibingka souffle. I thought I was going to be blown away by this through its presentation alone, but it fell short of my flavor expectations. It was very light & airy and garnished with powdered sugar on top. The bottom had a sweet sugar glaze, but I detected no taste of bibingka. It just tasted like whipped egg whites, not even a hint of coconut. Boo. Should've opted for a different dessert.  It's places like this that make me happy that Filipino food is slowly making its way into the mainstream. It's definitely not your Lola's home cooking, but the modern twist to traditional dishes is much appreciated.  Once they fix some service issues and improve what they have on the menu (flavor & portion sizes), I'm sure they'll be a force to be reckoned with in the culinary world. For now, they're just average.  Mabuhay! & Welcome to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Extremely clever concept, but overall poor execution.  We were very disappointed with our experience here and we didn't taste any love going into these dishes. I was really looking forward to some classic & updated Filipino food amidst ambiance, but unfortunately everything fell short. I'm even more surprised after reading my fellow yelper reviews; I suppose we came on the wrong day.   Our server was brief with us and not welcoming, she almost seemed bothered we were here. Whenever she would bring drinks to us, she would slam them down on the table and walk away. Awkward for sure, but I won't let that interfere with the main reason why we came.   Unfortunately, the food we sampled was mediocre and I really didn't feel there was any value offered here.  I enjoyed the flavor of the Pork Sisig with Egg ($12) but I really couldn't look past how much oil it was sitting in. I get it, it's a fried dish and it's supposed to be oily, but we've enjoyed this dish elsewhere and it definitely wasn't swimming in that much excess oil. Rated: 3.5/5  The Lechon Kawali ($12) was a huge regret. It was mostly soggy fat and not balanced or meaty at all. Lots of the skin bits were rock hard and way too hard to chew and the other remaining bits were too soggy and soft, soaked in oil. The sauces were also regrettably bland. I couldn't find any refinement in this dish. Carding's Tambayan (on Jones) makes this dish soooo much better & their sauce is to die for! Rated: 2/5  Mango Salad Slaw ($4) This came as a garnish on the Lechon Kawali plate and we enjoyed the refreshing flavor, so we asked for more. This really helped balance all of the oily fried pork dishes. Rated: 4/5  The Garlic Rice ($6) was a tease and lacking aromatic flavor. Where's the garlic? I see it, but I barely taste it. I've had garlic rice where you can taste a lot of care went into it, this one tasted like an afterthought. Rated: 3/5  To end on a poor note, we had our heart set on trying the Bibingka Souffle but alas they didn't have any. I guess it was not our lucky night...",

    "text": "I had a vision of a nice Filipino restaurant without the tacky decor such as a nipa hut, bamboo, abaniko, giant utentils on the wall, carabao or a jeepney. Where you can simply enjoy Filipino cuisine and know there is authenticity without it screaming at you. This is what Cutting Board is about.  Modern decor with lots of space without being stuffy or pretentious. The menu is simple enough with pretty much all the Filipino favorites such as fish balls, pancit, crispy pata. lechon kawali, garlic rice, lumpia, calamari, sinigang, sisig, paella, chicken inasal, kare kare, bangus, beef steak/ bistek, and tomato-based dishes. Filipino cuisine is a culmination of Malay, Chinese and Spanish (with Indian, Japanese, and American) foodgasm. So, to see paella or callos on the menu is not unusual. Choosing what I wanted to try was rather difficult because I wanted to EAT ALL THE FOOD!!! I figured, I'd start with my favorites first and then come back and try the others.  Lumpianitas: Basically, lumpia Shanghai. Ground pork with veggies in rice paper then, deep-fried. The dipping sauce was good and does not resemble anything you buy in bottles from Asian stores. My mom and my sister would have lumpia in bags and freeze them so, all I had to do whenever I had a craving was to fry them. Cutting Board's version is just half a level below what I've had before. 4/5  Choriburger Mini Meatballs: Choriburgers we've had in the past are spicier and I was not too fond of spicy food back when I first had these elsewhere. These are pork, beef, longganisa (Filipino sausage) meatballs with bourbon lime tomato sauce on a crostini. You can taste a bit of garlic. 5/5  Crispy Pork Sisig with Egg: There are two versions of sisig: the Kapampangan version which has pork cheek and cartilage, and the Manileno version which is basically finely chopped pork belly. Cutting Board's version is similar to the in between version - but meatier and the pieces are chunkier than the Manileno version but the flavors of the Kapampangan version. The best of both worlds. 5/5  Garlic Rice: I can't say enough how much I love garlic rice. I'm not a fan of boring plain ol' kanin. Flavors get elevated with this on the side of any ulam. 5/5  Chicken Inasal: The last time I went to the Philippines, I remember seeing chicken inasal everywhere. It's Filipino BBQ chicken marinated in lemongrass, garlic and lime juice. This comes with Java rice which is the perfect combination with Filipino BBQ. The chicken strips were tender, juicy and flavorful. 5/5  Crispy Pata: If your tito/tita, lolo/lola, dad/mom, kuya/ate ever had a heart disease, it's probably because of this. My dad would eat one crispy pata by himself - cardiac delight! Deep-fried brined pork hocks. What's interesting is that they give you two sauces. Normally, you get the soy sauce + vinegar dip. Some places use lechon sauce. Cutting Board gives you soy + vinegar dip, and GRAVY! At first dip, I was like \"this looks like lechon sauce but does not taste like lechon sauce at all! But it's surprisingly good\". It's a huge hock that can feed a family which is equivalent to 1 me. The skin is crunchy and the meat is juicy and flavorful. 5/5  Bibingka Souffle: I like souffles and bibingka is ok. Put them together and you get an airy, fluffy, egg white foamy baked treat. The salted egg that's normally on top of the bibingka is on the side and you get to drizzle your souffle with yummy creme. Nicely done! 4/5  They have 4 Seasons (juice with pineapple, mango, guyabano, and dalandan/lime)They offer a nice selection of beers including Red Horse which many Pinoys would tell you that drinking it would feel like you really got kicked by a horse. And they also have this calamansi cocktail - it's the drink that got me so drunk while I was on vacation in the Philippines a few years ago that now, I can't remember the name of it. But yeah, just ask for the alcoholic calamansi drink and they'll know what you're talking about.  Service was great. They don't have dancing, loud music and karaoke - thank goodness!!! They have TV's so you can watch sports that Filipinos love such as basketball and boxing...and maybe, putbol. I'm just hoping they would open for lunch soon.",

    "text": "New to Vegas and wanted to try this place out. The pictures from Yelp and Instagram had me drooling in anticipation to try this place for months! I really wanted to try the crispy sisig and coconut halo halo. There was a big group of us and this is what we had: ratings 1-5, (low-high)  Appetizers:  salt and pepper calamari- 5, yummy!  Lumpianitas- 2, tastes just like frozen ones you can buy at the store (2orders) Longganisa on a stick: 3 Garlic fries: 4  Entrees:  Crispy lechon kawali: 5, mango salsa yummy! Crispy pork sisig: 5, yummy! (2orders) Kobe/longganisa burger: ordered but didn't have it available  Lechon roll: ordered but not available Pancit: 2  Chicken adobo: 2 Pork Sisig tacos: 5, daughter loved them!  Garlic rice: 5 White rice: 5   Bunch of beers: 4  Dessert: Ube Souffle: 2, ehhhh wouldn't order it again, especially at $8- we ordered 2   Coconut Halo Halo: 1, my BIGGEST disappointment!!!!! It looks so cute in the pictures but when we had it....it was warm, slightly cold, a little bit of beans, coconut jelly and ??? Where was the shaved ice? Not very good at all. These are $10 and we ordered 2 and couldn't even finish it between the 8 of us. When I think of halo halo, I think of shaved ice, condensed milk, gelatin, coconut jelly, flan, ice cream, and nice and COLD! How sad that Jolibees halo halo is way better and tastes more expensive than what was served to us.   Now, you may ask...\"you have a lot of 5's\" but why the 1 star?   The service was ok, one waitress stood out because she smiled a lot and was really nice. She was the only one that smiled at us out of that whole staff...even the person who seemed to be the owner didn't even seem to acknowledge anyone or say thank you,seemed snobby. The happy people you see dancing and smiling in their Facebook videos were the complete opposite in person. Not smiling, complacent and seemed annoyed and couldn't wait for us to leave...the waiters seemed very new or inexperienced...more than one person spilled drinks on us and dropped longganisa skewers on to the table off the plate... we still ate it though  I know, gross! Despite all that we still would have tipped them at least 15% but gratuity is already included.   The one thing I can't stand is people that just don't care. Care about people, care about quality. They either served us halo halo with melted shaved ice or halo halo that's just not very good. Whatever it is, don't fall for the cute photos! I really wanted to love this place, but I'm just really disappointed.",

    "text": "For us to have a neighboring gastropub is amazing. i love the flare to the flavor, but kept the classic taste of the usual Filipino cocktail-match of food. Come visit something familiar but also have a different twist to your usual restaurant. I've been waiting for so long for a Filipino gastropub, and to for this to be next to my home-- I am blessed.    To those who seem to be disappointed, I understand where this is coming from and maybe you should change your perspective? I came from the midwest, in nowhere Indiana where they barely know where the Philippines is. So moving to a city where we have Pinoy Buffets and now a Gastropub is awesome and truly appreciated. The fact that they serve a select few of craft beers with a fusion of classical Filipino dishes is honestly great. I consider myself a foodie, who happens to be a local concierge now. I will definitely suggest this to be an option for someone who probably lives in a place/city that is not as diverse as Las Vegas.   If you're Filipino-American, try it! Amazing selection of a few craft brews, wonderful place to spend an afternoon with friends and family. Great ambiance!",

    "text": "A modern take on Filipino cuisine! Cutting Board offers traditional Filipino dishes with a twist, as well as a mix of American, Spanish and Asian flavors.   Lumpianitas - Typical lumpia shanghai accompanied by sweet chili sauce. I appreciated the meat to wrapper ratio.   Tamarind honey baby back ribs - Damn Daniel! Fall off the bone tender pork ribs with sticky tangy tamarind sauce. It comes with a slaw and plantains. I really liked this dish!  Kare Kare - A pretty good version. It's a peanut stew with oxtail and various vegetables. Cutting Board's version has grilled veggies on the side like eggplant, zucchini, green beans, and asparagus. You must eat this dish with a little bit of bagoong, which is a necessary condiment! The asparagus was unnecessary and was over cooked and very hard to eat.   Bibingka souffle - I was most excited for this dish, but it was the biggest let down. I like the creativity behind this, but this dessert wasn't for me. It tasted like a big fluff of sweet egg white. The salty egg and cheese on the side did not agree with my taste buds. After we left, I just wanted something traditional. I ended up getting halo halo from another place. I will have to try Cutting Board's halo halo on a future visit though.   What kind of Filipino place does not include white rice with their entrees? Seriously, I can't believe I had to order two sides of rice.   They have a good selection of beers. The Sam Adams nitro white was excellent. They also carry my favorite brand of grapefruit beer. Great, casual atmosphere. I liked they there was no TFC on the TVs, but instead several sports stations were on. It was nice to see the basketball playoffs on a nice big screen.  *****Yelp 2016 100 challenge***** 28/100",

My favorites are: Pork Binagooan, Pork Sisig, Chicken Adobo, and the Pancit. The only thing I'd have to say is pay with card. I've paid with cash twice before and both times, the manager had to run and get change from a store nearby. It took a long time to get my change both times.",

The fried chicken was tasty but a little dry and I would give it 4 stars. We tried the Pinkabet and our group hated it.  The shrimp paste is way over powering.  But of course I just noticed I should of ordered the veggies without the paste, my bad.  We tried the lettuce wraps as well, they were okay but salty and I like salt.  Anyway, I will go back to eat the adobo and lumpia, and will definitely try other things.  Oh I met Tiffany the owner, she was so welcoming and very sweet!",

I wouldn't really call it a gastropub because they serve mainly traditional Filipino dishes, but they do have a nice looking cocktail list. San Miguel on draft, so you know it's serious!      The highlights for me was the sisig, the lechon kawali, and the ube souffle. The kare kare was just okay, but it's never been a favorite of mine. It was easily overshadowed by the great flavors of the other dishes we tried.    The restaurant was lovely, clean, and appealing. Our server was seriously wonderful! Ask any questions without shame, she was happy to clarify the menu and give suggestions.    If you leave without dessert you are missing out! I had planned to order the turon before we left but I was too full! Next time, definitely.",

Their business hours here are usually 4PM-11PM and we came right when it opened. Inside is pretty quiet and I wish they played some type of melo music to keep it from not being awkward from waiting for out food and hearing all the cooking in the kitchen.  We started with the bone marrow as an appetizer. It came in 2 bones and a couple pieces of garlic bread. It was very juicy and tender and tasted very well with the garlic bread. I order the Tocino Kobe burger as the main course. The burger was pretty huge and the Kobe patty and tocino blended very well with the burger. It also came with very thin cut fries mixed with regular and sweet potato fries. For drinks they have a small variety of alcohol and I ordered a glass of the Alaskan beer. I enjoyed the beer and also a glass of their mango juice.  The food came out a good amount of time. The presentation of our plates was beautiful. The customer service was pleasing and our overall experience was excellent.",

    "text": "Came here on Veteran's day and was glad to see they were open.  I was looking forward to trying their souffle which the waiter informed us takes approximately 10 minutes to make so order it basically knowing it takes a while to make.  The ambience was nice and not typical to any other Filipino restaurant I have been in.  I am not a fan of Filipino food but I have a few dishes that I like.  I ordered the pork sisig, my sister ordered the oxtail kare kare, and my niece ordered the calamari.  When I asked if the dishes came with rice the waiter said it did not.  It was $2 extra for rice.  This is when it started to go downhill.    The calamari came out first before the other meals even though we asked it to be brought out with the other dishes.  Not a big deal I guess but shows how much attention was paid to our request.  Our waiter then came to inform us that they were making new batches of white rice so he asked if we would like garlic rice instead and he would not charge us for it.  We said that was fine.   When the food came out I was excited to try the sisig.  My first bite however was traumatizing.  I did not know that the pork would be so sour!  It was very vinegary and oily.  I never had sisig before so I did not know what it was supposed to taste like but sour was not what I had in mind.  It was more sour than adobo.  The taste does grow on you but it definitely needs rice and the egg that came with it.  The description of flavor should be on the menu.  If it was I apologize but I missed it.    As for the other food; the calamari was alright and while the kare kare had tender pieces of oxtail, the sauce tasted weird.  It was a weird gray color instead of a bright orange brown.  The vegetables were also gray and not vibrant and very very oily.  The vegetables looked grilled but tasted deep fried.  Before we finished eating we informed the waiter that we wanted to put in an order for the ube souffle and that's when he told us they were all out of the souffles.  I was very disappointed after that.  We ordered another dessert but it was not that great either.    When we reviewed the bill I noticed we were charged for the 2 sides of white rice that we ordered.  I informed the waiter and he said that yes he still charged us for the rice but substituted for the garlic one instead and did not charge us for the garlic one.  That was not what I thought would happen but I said fine, whatever.    Thankfully the waiter was nice enough to take the rice of the bill.  I wish he took the dessert off the bill as well or gave us a discount for not having the items on the menu we wanted.    In summary - the service was okay, the food however was blah and overpriced.  Most likely will not be back",

They all tasted wonderful, lumpia was fried to perfection, and had a wonderful taste. The black mussels had no sand in them and the coconut milk curry that they were made in complemented the protein. Along with the fried rice, that had the wonderful taste of just melting in your mouth. Will come again.",

It's a great new addition to the Filipino scene, offering a different twist from the norm. We had some street food from the grill, bone marrow, seafood paella, sisig, crispy pata and the bibingka souffle and coconut halo halo for dessert! You definitely need to have the bibingka.  There was lots of space, great for large groups. Can't wait to make another visit and try more.",

    "text": "I'm usually on board to try any restaurant that's considered, \"Gastropub\". but when I hear Filipino Gastropub, it's definitely a must-try.   FOOD: After trying several items from their menu, there really isn't a lot of different experimenting with traditional Filipino dishes like a \"Asian fusion\" restaurant would have. However, everything we tried was pretty solid. Bangus Sisig - definitely my favorite dish here. The sizzle, the grease, the seasoning, and the zest were all perfectly executed. Fried fish that's mixed with a bunch of vegetables and butter that's served in a sizzling plate.  Crispy Pata - super fried pork legs with tons of flavor and best dipped in one of the sauces. I really liked the flavor but the meat was a little too tough for me. Kare-Kare - traditional flavor with oxtail that's perfectly cooked. The vegetables on side is a nice touch cause you can dip them in the Kare-Kare sauce. The one odd aspect of the restaurant is that basic white rice does not automatically come with the dishes. The only Asian restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't give you white rice free. But it's cool cause we end up having to order the Garlic Rice or Seafood Fried Rice which are both super tasty.  They have pretty unique drinks here including the cocktails with Calamansi.. they are a little on the weak side though. Great beer list!  AMBIANCE: The look of what could be a really cool gastropub.. but it feels more like a nice family restaurant. During one of our visits, there was a DJ playing really loud music.. it was actually a little awkward and not necessary.  SERVICE: Awesome service.. everyone is very friendly and welcoming. True Filipino hospitality!  TIPS: Order everything! You won't find a bad dish on the menu.",

We had the Lumpianitas tapas to start and the dipping sauce is the perfect blend of sweet & hot. I enjoyed the Coconut Curry Noodle soup but without the chicken (tho I have had it with chicken and it's really yummy) and my son ordered the Pancit Bami, which is two kinds of noodles with chicken, shrimp, beef and pork. We ended up with take-out boxes because the portions are very generous. 5 star service from our waiter Mike as well!! Great lunch date with the son.",

Maybe they just had the worst employees all working together on that one day? I don't know..  Food was good but I don't think that is enough alone to bring us back... They really need to train their employees better.   Our server (don't remember him saying his name) rarely came to check on us. He forgot my husband's Thai tea but was forgiven because he caught himself. He never looked at our drinks, we had to ASK FOR REFILLS.  They forgot one of our dishes... Had to cook it again... Then gave it to another table... I don't understand how that happened because there was only 2 other tables in the restaurant... By the time they offered to make it again we were already done with our meal and didn't even want to wait for the dish... Anyways, they kindly took it off our bill and put it in a Togo box for us.  Our server brought us our check, never asked if we needed anything else or wanted to order dessert. We actually did want to order dessert but at this point were like F the dessert and just wanted to get out of the restaurant... 15 mins passed and the server never came back for the check so my husband ended up going up to the register to pay.",

Up until then, we thought we were getting good Filipino food.  Like another reviewer stated, if you haven't had real Filipino food, you will think it's great.    Every time we have been there, we have requested one of the larger tables because my husband is a big guy.  He needs leg room.  Every time we have been seated at one of the smaller tables.  This has always been when there was maybe 2-3 other tables with customers seated at them...basically during a very slow time for them. The man that seats us has the personality of a slug.  And as another reviewer said, he smells heavily of cigarettes.  Ugh  The beer list is okay, however we always hear, \"we are out of that one\".   The servers have always been attentive and very courteous.  Which is the best thing thing place has going for it.",

Of course, nothing beats mom's home cooking (I'm sure most would say the same haha) BUT Cutting Board does help fill the void.   I had their Seafood sinigang (tamarind based soup dish with veggies and seafood which can be eaten with rice or as is) and their Pinakbet (veggies and shrimp cooked in a shrimp paste). I loved both! The sinigang could've been a little more sour but that's just my personal preference but overall it was really tasty and they gave an ample amount of seafood and veggies as well as the broth. The pinakbet was really good as well. You can really tell that the veggies were freshly cooked because none of them were soggy. It was perfectly cooked as it wasn't too salty and just the right amount of flavor from the shrimp paste.   For dessert, we had the bibingka souffle. I'm not too sure how to describe it but it was buttery and sugary but not too sweet. You pour the condensed milk in the middle and it's just amazing. I've never had anything like it and I would most definitely go back for that.   The service was impeccable. They seated my friends and I even though they were set to close at 10pm and we arrive a little after 9pm. They got our food out to us in a timely manner and consistently checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. The ambiance was simple nothing really stood out to me in terms of decor but the overall experience was great. This will be my go-to when I am in need of some filipino food in my life.",

I tried their Lumpianitas, that was delicious! What I've been wanting to try was the bone marrow & guess what no bone marrow @ 6pm. The waiter leaves to speak w/an old woman who looks like the Chef who came across upset when he asked about the marrow, he comes back to tell us \"Oh we have some but it will take a few minutes as it's not cooked\" No thank you, I pass! Bone marrow does not take a few minutes & if so happened they did have some, why didn't they have when I asked? I skipped because it was either old or frozen. My Husband ordered the chicken adobo, that took forever to come out. With his chicken adobo plates, he was to get the soup of the day, when asked, the waiter once again confronts the grouchy looking old woman chef who then says \"Only for breakfast, you get the soup of the day\" no where on that menu did it state that. I tried their mango mule & that was so delicious. A party of 10 came in, our waiter took our check & debit card, places it down to go & get the orders of the party of 10, meanwhile we waited til he was done, another time wasted waiting. They could sure use a younger Chef in that place & learn some multi-tasking skills.",

The kare kare meat needed a little more time to tenderize but the flavors were authentic.  I liked that they separated the veggies.  The lechon kawali was crispy but not over done, the sauce was on point.  The halo halo was a bit pricey at $12, but definitely unique.  It didn't really taste like halo halo should be but the coconut portion of it was delicious. I'm curious about their breakfast selections.  I'll be back for that.

    "text": "My brother had his eye on this place for a while after his friend recommended it to him. He wanted to check the place out to get some ideas for in the future if he does decide to open a restaurant of his own. His friend hyped it up a lot, saying how amazing the dishes were for filipino food. Basically, elevated or gourmet style filipino food. Definitely was not the case for me (Yes, I am a Filipina, so I know what I'm saying). Went here with 4 people, 5 including myself, so we ordered a good amount from the menu and shared everything to try out whatever we could.  Let's start off with the appetizers we ordered. The lumpianitas. Just your basic and typical filipino lumpia that you would find at those huge filipino parties/gatherings. I'll end it at that. The salt and pepper calamari had an okay taste. Perhaps a tad bit salty, I've had better in korean/japanese restaurants. Then we ordered some veggies, just to have it in our system. We got the green beans and kabocha squash. Green beans were too hard and the whole dish lacked flavor. My mom and brother can make it better.  Moving on to the signature dishes, we got the chicken inasal. I was expecting a lot from this one because of the ones I'd have back in the Philippines (anyone familiar with Mang Inasal?) It lacked flavor and it definitely would've been better with vinegar and red chili pepper, which they sadly did not provide. We also ordered the crispy pork sisig with egg. We actually got 2 orders of this one and it was one of the better dishes out of the whole order we had. Now, once again, I've definitely had better in the homeland, but this is by far the best I've had here in America, so I'll give them that. I'd recommend this dish out of everything on the menu if you guys decide to drop by and give this place a go. We also skipped on the white rice and went with the paella valencia. Not bad for paella, you guys should also try it, but I'm not a super fan since my boyfriend can make it way better.  Last out of what we ordered was desserts, where we ordered 2 of the bibingka souffles. I actually found it super adorable since when we got it, it was really fluffy and jiggly. Tasted pretty good, nice amount of sweetness and soft texture.  The service was good, very accommodating. AC was heavenly since we went during this summer. I was expecting more from this restaurant with all the hype I got. Like honestly, I was expecting some presentation with the food at least, but no, more like my tita (aunt) cooked it up and served it. I've had my good share of being raised in the Philippines for some of my life, thus eating and cooking the food myself, so I should know good filipino food when I have it. If you've been raised eating filipino dishes, then perhaps you should eat elsewhere in sin city. Otherwise, this place really is good if you're not of filipino ethnicity and would like to try filipino cuisine or just want to get that filipino food craving fixed. Maybe I would have given this place a better rating if my expectations weren't raised too high.",

If I was just rating the food I'd probably give this place 4 stars, but there were other factors that lead me to take away a star.  We ordered:  - Pork sisig tacos - 3 come in an order and this was probably the highlight of the meal for us; both for value and taste  - Filli classic omelette - contained sliced longanisa, spinach, and mushroom... good taste combo and actually comes with the option of rice as a side - ube pancake - free with yelp check in, though our server forgot about it until we asked where it was once we had finished our meal; very tasty ube flavor, I wanted to lick the ube sauce off the plate - chicken inasal and fried chicken - both well cooked and had good flavor but neither came with rice. Also portion side was rather small for the price  - garlic rice - since dishes do not come with rice we order a side of garlic rice, which had good flavor; but once again portion size was small for the price  Our server today was very friendly but seemed rather distracted, unfamiliar with the menu, and failed to check in on us once our food was brought out - as mentioned earlier she forgot about one of our dishes until we questioned it.  I can understand some inattention when a restaurant is busy but this was not the case, aside from  my group there were only 3 other tables present. Drinks weren't refilled and had to track her down for the check despite already having the table cleared of dishes.",

My girlfriend has made Sisig for me before but after I had the first taste of the CB sisig, I jokingly told my GF that she needed to step her game up!  Of course, she rolled her eyes at me as she tasted the sisig for herself.

We were the first people to come in and ordered when they opened at 5pm. The table next to us got their food first before we did, when we ordered first? I don't blame the servers but i do blame the kitchen for being slow in cooking the food. This place already had a bad reputation, and they continued to not be consistent with their portions since the last time we came here.   My experience coming back was just a big upset since it was one of my favorite filipino restaurants to come back and try again. Its safe to say i wont be visiting anytime soon again.",

However, I was disappointed at how that food was divvied up. The biggest portion was of rice. Rice is great, but it's the cheapest of the items to make. (The kamayan meal is $90). There was only a handful of lumpia (perhaps 12 halves?) and three fried plantains, and those are so popular for snacking on throughout a meal that I was surprised at the stingy amount. I enjoyed the pancit, although it didn't have much flavor. The beef dish had a strange flavor although I enjoyed the onions it came with. The pollo adobo was tender but otherwise did not have too much flavor. There were other items provided, but not much that impressed me. I also didn't find the presentation that professional. And, to conclude, the experience was marred by a broken AC on a 110 degree day. Inside was sweltering, and they only had one fan plugged in the corner for the entire place. At least the service was decent, but the 2 stars comes from losing AC and the food sampling and quality.",

    "text": "With only a handful of good Filipino restaurants to choose from in the northwest area of Las Vegas, Cutting Board comes out on top of all of them.  With its exceptional service, delicious food, and streamlined menu concept, Cutting Board offers something for both newcomers to Filipino cuisine and also to adobo connoisseurs.  While the restaurant could use a little more personality with its decor, it still receives a 5-star rating in my book.  Service 5/5: We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  The menu is displayed on a cutting board clipboard (nicely themed and very fitting!).  The food came out hot and sizzling and in a timely manner.  We were constantly in contact with a our waiter, who was very attentive and polite.  Food 5/5: The highlight of the night was the bangus sisig.  It was so delicious and paired well with our fried rice!  We also tried the bibingka souffle.  It was light and not too heavy.  Perfect with two people to share.  We didn't try any of the alcohol, but our waiter did confirm that they had San Miguel and Red Horse (among dozens of others in their selection).  Good stuff!  Location 4.5/5 The restaurant is located right next to Wienerschnitzel and is a little tricky to get into at first.  But it's not really a problem!  I do think the inside could use some more personality.  Perhaps some pictures of the Philippines or some sort of artsy theme to add some character.  The lights are cute and the TVs offer entertainment for guests while they dine and catch up.  It is very spacious and clean.  Not too much to complain about here.  Overall: 5/5 Cutting Board is a great restaurant that has something to offer for everyone.  The food is delicious and the service is great.  Go!",

Even the oxtail mare mare was way overpriced, and again a different taste that was not worth it for me. I think next time I'll try the oxtail soup with cabbage.

    "text": "This is the first time my hubs and I decided to go for some \"hip\" and \"modern\" Filipino cuisine. I wish I could've given this place at least 4 stars. I think what threw me off is the cold/old tasting entrees and appetizers.   My husband ordered the Crispy Shrimp...it was not crispy. He also ordered the BBQ wings - which were excessively salty.   I ordered the Chicken Inasal, this dish was weird...the chicken was so burnt. It tasted chalky and old too! Why serve customers old food?! I mean $12 for old chicken? Sheesh, at least give it at a discounted price.   The service was eh, okay. Our server forgot our extra napkins :(. Our water came late too. All the salt from the food was dehydrating my taste buds.   The best part of this restaurant was the Bibingka Souffle. This WAS THE ONLY best part. Other than that, don't order apps or entrees. Just stick to dessert or coffee.",

    "text": "Crispy Lechon Kawali......hmmmmm......  Tamarind Honey Babyback Rib......hhmmmmmm.......  I'm not so knowledgeable when it comes to Filipino food, besides adobo and couple of other dishes I've had before. So this review isn't baised on \"how Filipino food should be\", but baised more on \"taste good or not taste good\"  It was one really delicious, flavorful, porky feast and I loved it!!  Mild, spicy, sweet and salty, saucy, crispy.  Food like these are great for exploring and training your taste palette.  Between me, my husband and our toddler who eats like a teenager, 1 app, 2 entre, 1 side was more than plenty.   Can't wait to go back to try other items!  We visited there a little after 6:30 pm on Saturday evening. Was seated immediately. Hosts and servers were very attentive, friendly.   I thought this place'd be great for date night. Installation is very laid back, casual, full of sunlight (while the sun is out, obviously), And their food is super sexy. If you want to impress someone on the first date, this would be a seal on the deal :D",

The place is now Under New Management and one of the owners Tiffany was very attentive to my needs I must say I will definitely be back again. I once again had my favorite dishes pancit and chicken adobo. The chicken adobo is a little bit different tasting than how I remember in the Philippines I felt like it was missing something so the owner Tiffany suggested that I get  a little side of vinegar and mix it up in the sauce and it tasted delicious. And on a side note if you're reading this review today come on down tonight from 9 to 1 a.m. and they're having a free Halloween party.",

I took my family, 4 adults 2 kids under 6, they charge me as a party of 6 or more with 18% gratuity surcharge. It wasn't posted anyplace in the restaurant or the menu so by doing this, they lost me as a customer. Prices also went higher. They had a party of 4 that came after then a 2 after them. That was it while we were there for 2 hours. I wish they make it. Tiffany, we had 4 adults and 2 kids under 6, we were the only customers there until for about an hour later, I look it up and you had 39 demerits. I hope you keep up the cleanliness, it always happened to ethnic restaurant, they don't follow the American standard. Good luck",

The oxtail was tender, and the veggies went well with it. It was even better with the garlic rice, wasn't too much garlic flavor which I appreciate.  The staff are very nice and the place is pretty nice too, just a bit of a drive from where I live. I'd highly recommend this place to friends. Definitely coming back to try the buko halo halo.",

The restaurant has an open layout with a cool industrial vibe. We were seated quickly and overall the staff were very friendly and helpful.  Our server took the time to explain the shareable tapas, family style entries, and the different sides.  She let us take all of the time we needed to figure out what we wanted and even recommended the pancit.  We ordered the paella Valencia and the pancit and two drinks. Drinks and water came out quickly and the food was not too far behind.  The pancit was well balanced and sauced perfectly. The lemon wedge on the side gave great contrast. The paella had a beautiful crust on the bottom and all of the seafood was cooked well. I love the spice of the rice itself, very flavorful. Our server checked on us a few times and brought us extra napkins since we were making a little bit of a mess! This spot was an excellent value as well! One beer, one bloody, a coffee and two entries only 36$!! Needless to say, we both agreed we needed to bring our significant others back and soon.",

We're from the Bay so she told us that the owners of CB also own a popular Filipino restaurant up here so, we had high hopes.  Unfortunately, their head cook was out sick that day so we couldn't order the Pancit Bami we kept reading about.  I was really sad that only one person had the capacity of making pancit.  Secondly, they were out of Lumpanitas.  Ugh, you're killing me, Ate!  Really?  We couldn't get mad at her as it wasn't her fault, and, she was super embarrassed by it.  So, we ended up ordering their Lechon Kawali which was standard, Chicken Adobo which was salty, Sisig which was really good, and Garlic Rice, which was tasty.  I really wanted to try other dishes, like their Kare-Kare and Paella but was afraid of further rejection.  I'd love to give them a second chance, as I'm sure our visit just happened to be a fluke, but the hubz clearly does not want to return and well, he's my ride.  #GastropubEhDiWow",

The servers wear shirts that say something like,  \"Try a slice of Filipino food,\" which is clever considering The Cutting Board name and the fact that the food is a modern vision of traditional Filipino food woven with modern techniques and quality ingredients.   We were a party of 5 and ordered 16 items (yes, 16, not including steamed rice). We had gambas and longganisa, chicken lettuce wraps, black mussels, choriburger meatballs, bone marrow, crispy pata, pork sisig, garlic noodles, oxtail kare kare, chicken inasal, bibingka souffle, coconut halo halo, bread pudding, lychee mojito, calamansi mojito, and a martini.  I liked all of the dishes and had at least two servings of each (we ate family style). My favorite main dishes (though all were packed with flavor and tasty) were the sisig and crispy pata. The acidity and slight bitterness of the kale salad that accompanied the pata was such a perfect pairing with that crispy friend deliciousness. It was also really good with the marrow. Oh, that marrow was the butter of gods! I'm not a fan of chicken, but, as I mentioned, I had at least two servings of the chicken inasal and the rice that went with the chicken reminded me of being wrapped in a warm blanket on a cold winter's day.  All the desserts we got were amazing. The bibingka souffle was such a perfect balance of sweet, salty, fluffy, and finish. The bread pudding was served with a sauce and ice cream that sang to my soul. My heart belongs to the coconut halo halo, though. It is not your traditional halo halo, but it has all the elements that gave me the familiarity of what I love about halo halo. We had ours with ube, my favorite flavor. It was served in a chilled young coconut. The best part was scraping that young coconut meat to eat with the halo halo components.   My friends couldn't get enough of the oxtail kare kare and its sauces. They also loved the black mussels bathed in an irresistible coconut sauce. Remember to dip that buttery bread in there!  The food put me in awe and Bernadette was the best waitress. As you can imagine, we were asking a lot of questions, ordering lots of food, and getting a lot of leftovers packed up for our breakfast (and lunch) the next day.   I can't wait to return...on an empty stomach",

    "text": "The Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub was cleverly created with passion of Filipino Food & the craft of fusion. It's modern day twist to traditional Filipino dishes proves that it too, can lure other ethnicities, other than Filipinos, to dine and experience the culture through delicacy. The concept is great...however there were downfalls in my dining experience which explains my less than mediyoker 2 star review.  Located just off Rock Springs & Lake Mead near the US 95, it's location is easily accessible and inviting to the area locals. It's building  was formerly another Filipino restaurant and Chinese restaurant which both failed to thrive. (Let's hope the cutting board survives and surpasses its predecessors). Upon entering the premises, you get a feel of some sort of seafood joint (you know the type that sells crabs, shrimps, crawfish and the whole shabang), yet it also feels like a warehouse still under construction. Maybe it does give it a Filipino feel, but is definitely different. They do have some nice decor though, with menus paying homage to its name with cutting board themes and big flat screen televisions especially for those anticipated sporting events and what not.  The place it self overall seemed decently clean mind you the warehouse feel and the servers were friendly and occasionally checking up on patrons...but on to the food...  Food was decently delicious, but definitely not on par with it's high price to portion ratio. We ordered sisig, Lechon kawali, Lechon ramen, calamari, bone marrow & Kare Kare. The dishes were uniquely displayed only to disappoint how the servings are strategically presented to appear how it should be, but only an illusion. Garnishes of mango strings & onions slices seemed to be 1/3 of the order.   Another gripe I had was feeling ripped off. Our family ordered 5 cups of plain white rice at $2.00 a cup. (Should be free). Upon being served...we were surprised it was in one bowl, the waitress noticing our questioning looks, immediately stated she just put it together. That's fine and dandy, even though we did not ask to put it together, but the table next to us had individual cups of rice and it was easily clear to see that we were at least missing a cup and a half of rice. We didn't even finish it, but the point is we still paid the price and deserve to be treated fair and not have to feel like we are being taken advantage of. Common now, rice is cheap, be honest and not stingy.  Over all the food was good, tasty & we left with a full stomach (busog!) but is it enough for me to come back? Honestly, this place wouldn't be my main go to Filipino restaurant. I won't name names, but I would rather drive further to a Filipino/Vietnamese fusion restaurant just off rainbow and 215 which offers a good amount of serving portion at a respectable and reasonable price.   I think it's only fair to give it another shot and try some of their other stuff. In fairness they are just starting out. I just hope they listen to reviews and customers to help improve negative issues. It's great to have another Filipino restaurant in the valley that caters in the delicacy and something new at that. I hope my next experience will be better so that I can update this review and give them a higher rating they deserve.",

    "text": "Omg. Where to start??!?  The food was awesome. Totally authentic and tasted great!  I tried the bibingka souffle and that was interesting because souffle aren't something you see in the PI all the time. But in Vegas you can see it all!  LOL. The souffle was good. Not too over sweet and you could taste the bibingka in every bite but it wasn't the same consistency of traditional bibingka. It was crazy good. The cocktails are on point. I had a mango mojito that was sooooo good and the hubby had a calimansi cooler cocktail. It was sooo good. The service and ambiance was great.   My only con is the restaurant was pretty warm inside. We were in there later in the evening but we ordered sinagang and it was great but we were both breaking a sweat while eating it. It's kinda unfortunate that everything else was great but we were both uncomfortable because it was just too warm in there. Even our server was glowing because she too was breaking a sweat and we were the only table she was waiting on.  We did ask if the AC wasn't working and we were told that the managers don't like to have the AC running too cold. Well I hate to break it too ya but Vegas is a desert and it's freakin hot as hell even at 930pm!",

    "text": "When I saw the sign for Cutting Board a Filipino Gastropub, I was ecstatic! A Filipino restaurant that serves high-end beer and Filipino cuisine? The business, based out of San Francisco, finally expanded into town. Vegas surely deserves a high end, upbeat, modern Filipino restaurant where tradition meets fusion just like the motherland! If you have been to the Philippines in recent years, you know what I'm talking about. This place just upgraded Filipino cuisine to a whole new level in taste, creativity, and presentation. This is the first of its kind in town!   There are good number of Filipino restaurants in Vegas, but for the most, in my experience, there is \"no love\" with the end results. Well, that all changed tonight! The menu cries out..What the heck do I order?!? I had anxiety attack! Hahaha! The tapas, signature/traditional, noodles and soup, and casa rice?!? Oh my! If you're familiar with Filipino food, you're definitely in for a treat with a twist!   I am usually a stickler for going traditional. I ordered the lumpianitas, bangus sisig, fish and shrimp balls, bibingka souffle, and calamansi (Philippine lime) juice. The lumpianitas were crispy, but the flavor didn't stand out. I was given 2 different sauces, sweet chili and some kind of vinegar dipping sauce with not too much acid and with a good amount of sweetness that really improved the flavor of the lumpianitas. The bangus was unmarinated, chopped and garnished with mango salad as stated on the menu. However, mine didn't have mango pieces. It came with onion, tomatoes, and scallions. The whole fish just needed a little more flavor, but the skin was super crispy! I would have preferred a marinated version of this dish. The fish/shrimp balls had an excellent presentation. It took me back to my childhood memories eating street food at your own risk! The shrimp balls had a great batter but both tasted just okay. I'm told the bibingka souffle is their signature dessert!  It came with a small piece of salted egg, dried cottage cheese, and an awesome custard sauce that paired well with the souffle. The calamansi juice was very refreshing, but it didn't have enough tartness to it, like it is supposed to have.   The atmosphere puts other Filipino restaurants to shame. The open floor plan gives it an industrial feel, with community tables, flat screens, and nice view of the bar. This place is family friendly. The prices are shockingly affordable, with good quality food. I'm glad a restaurant like this opened up on the west side of town. I can't wait to be back to try all their menu items one by one. Filipino food is one of the more underrated cuisines. I'm happy that Cutting Board found a new home in Vegas!  Their bibingka souffle made it on my list of \"Thousand Things to Eat Before You Die\"! :)",

But this place is more like open and bright concept.  Let's start with our first order the dulong dulong (small glass fish) which was served two ways, one with squid ink and the other one had a nice kick to it if you like spicy with a side of garlic baguettes. Then after a few minutes our bangus sisig and java rice came. Then followed by the tamarind baby back ribs. I felt like we did not have time to enjoy our appetizer and everything came out almost at the same time. The food was a bit disappointing. There was no WOW factor for me.  I heard that the bibingka souffle was one of their signature dessert, so we had to try. We were not disappointed. If I had to go back this would be the reason.  I will try to convince my husband to try it again. I hope they keep the place clean, as most Filipino restaurants I've been to needs more attention to cleanliness.",

Not to sweet, not too sour, it's just right. My mom got a Mango Mojito--she says it was way too strong, but I disagreed, it was still yummy.   The menu included Filipino classics with modern presentations. My table ended up ordering the Kare-Kare, Pinakbet, and Pork Sisig. The Kare-Kare is the best I've ever had (SORRY LOLA.) It was super taste that I didn't even have to use the bagoong they provided. The presentation of the Kare-Kare was also so pretty and well put together. The Pinakbet was also really good, and the Pork Sisig had an over easy egg in the middle---I never knew eggs and sisig were a good pair until I have Cutting Board's.   I've been looking for a Filipino Restaurant here in Vegas since I moved for my Mother's cooking cravings; and I am so glad I found Cutting Board!",

    "text": "I love Filipino food. I love pancit. But Filipino restaurants that I have been to fall short of the mark. I am happy to say that this does not. It's not traditional Filipino food, so that should be mentioned. I have had quite a lot of traditional Filipino food, whether it was my girlfriend, a friend in college, or a lady from Manila who always made this amazing pancit that is the dish of dreams.   So I got the Pancit Bami. It was really good. It was almost more like an Asian stirfry, albeit a super delicious one. And my friend got the Crispy Lechon Kawali, a deep-fried pork dish. Wow, that was amazing, so superbly prepared.   Lumpianitas made great appetizers.  This we washed down with San Miguel, a Filipino beer.   And yes, service was good and friendly.",

Served with toasted bread.  Kare Kare was average. Nothing special and really pricey $18. Yikes. It did come with a good amount of oxtail and veggies.   Sisig was delicious! Some of the best I've ever had. Yum yum. Must try. Came to the table sizzling with an egg.  Tamarind BBQ ribs also delicious! Served with plantains. This dish was definitely my favorite but it was expensive as well $18. Tamarind BBQ had a different taste, one of a kind!   The star deduction is for the rice! They charge $2 for a cup of white rice. Although my waiter did hook it up with rice, it does bother me that I have to pay so much for rice. We're Filipinos, we eat rice with everything... and if you truly insist on charging for rice, at least make it $2 for 3-4 cups!",

I think it's a great concept & a relevant way to introduce non-Filipinos to our Filipino culture & cuisine. I'm a little biased when it comes to the taste of Filipino cooking, so my review is solely on their concept, restaurant, & their service (considering their dishes have been modified to match the modern concept).  The service was great & our server recommend what was popular & was she thought was good.   The restaurant is very spacious. There's a karaoke area, and they even have a live band person on Friday & Saturday nights.  The food looked & smelled amazing. I love how restaurants put a twist to traditional food & make it look pretty.   I really hope they do well since this is the only Filipino restaurant here in Vegas that's bringing a modern twist to Pinoy Cuisine!",

My favorite has to be the roasted bone marrow. The adobo rice is another fantastic dish that I would recommend. Be sure to save some space for dessert. The bibingka souffle is a must try. The service is great. The servers are friendly and provide fantastic insight regarding the dishes. A little pricier than your usual Filipino restaurant but it's worth the damage. Four stars because there's always room for improvement.",

Atmosphere: Lively and comfortable There is both neon lighting and an aspect of the Pacific Islander culture in the decor of the restaurant. Gives a modern feel upon entering, especially with the suggestion of the name \"Gastropub\".  Service: Quite reasonable We were seated promptly. The servers were nice and answered all of our questions efficiently. The servers shared their opinions upon request and we were able to narrow down what we wanted on the menu.  Food: Lacked availability The food that was served to us was nothing short of delicious. We had the bone marrows, which was as smooth as butter itself, the kare-kare was flavorful and tasted genuine. The thing that truly disappointed me was that I asked for longanisa but was informed that they were out of it after ordering, then I asked for another dish, but they were out of that dish as well. As stated before, the food served was delicious, but without the communication that certain dishes were available made a significant blow to my visit.   Summary: Worth it! I would give this place 5 stars, but not having the traditional Filipino dishes available at the start really did not put a good taste in my mouth, figuratively, but not quite literally. The food is truly genuine to the Filipino culture and worth the taste. Just sure that the food that you want is available at the start.",

My cousin is from Charleston, SC visiting us for the weekend and his cravings for Filipino food led us to this hidden gem of a restaurant in Summerlin. Our knowledgeable and friendly server helped us navigate through the restaurant's expansive menu and we finally settled on starting with the apps: roasted bone marrow (topped with garlic butter, herbs, parmesan cheese), pork sisig tacos (comes in threes) paired with local beers (Red Horse!) and the Mango Mule cocktail. Our mains consisted of their crispy pork belly binagoongan, paella valencia and capped with the delectable bibingka souffle for dessert. Our party left very satisfied and impressed with our dinner and we plan to add Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub to our list of go-to's to take family and friends visiting Las Vegas, they certainly live up to their theme of giving a modern take on the Filipino-American Cuisine.",

I was hoping this would be the case, since we don't have a nice Filipino restaurant on my side of town and I didn't want it closing down.  We have ordered take-out from this place several times and eaten here once. So here's my two cents about this place:  1. I love their kare-kare and since my boys are not into this dish as much as I am, I get the leftovers all to myself. Yummo 2. My son loves their sisig. He eats out a lot with his friends and he actually took his friends here just so they can taste the sisig. As for me, you guys know how picky I am when it comes to this dish. I think Cafe Moda's is still #1  but since this is closer to home, I order here more often.  3. No problem with the service, they were friendly and food came fast. My family and I enjoyed having dinner here and will be coming back.",

    "text": "AI SOS!  What do you say?  Filipino Gastropub near me on the NW side of town?  Less than 5 minutes away from the Las Vegas Athletic Club I frequent?  Intriguing, I must try!    Probably the 1st of its kind anywhere in the Las Vegas valley, Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub was worth checking out!  Family & I went on a sunny Saturday morning - yes, right after working out!!  Gotta get that important serving of carbs & protein in to help fuel new muscle!  Upon stepping into Cutting Board, quite surprised - the restaurant is very nice!  Airy & spacious, slick concrete floors, huge bar space.  Yah, totally reminiscent of a pub of sorts!  But I'll save a drink for some other time.  We got a bit overzealous on the menu and ended up ordering a TON of food for only 3 people:  -Lumpianitas ($7) - ground pork & veggies rolled up and deep fried till golden -Bangus Sisig ($14) - milk fish minced in house sauce and garnished with mango salad -Pancit Bami ($9) - chicken, shrimp, sausage & veggies -Crispy Lechon Kawali ($10) - deep fried pork belly -Adobo Fried Rice ($9) - topped with plantain  Holy cow...it was really a LOT of food!  All perfect for sharing, family style!  Put up your feet folks - if you're not ashamed, go do it KAMAYAN style!!  No forks!  No spoons!  But unfortunately, since we weren't home (and no other table around us was doing it either LOL) I went with the utensils route.  Very nice presentation on the dishes, colorful and very picture worthy!  Like the touch of using actual cutting boards for some of the entrees.  Taste?  To be up front and honest - this is not your 100% traditional Filipino fare.  Most Filipino food is seen as assertive in flavor (especially in salty/sour) and much less on the color spectrum range.  But...I can say, this I like!  The food is a great jumping board for the less initiated in Filipino food, but still bridges the gap with the more familiar tastes.  We tend to eat with our eyes and the dishes at the Cutting Board look sooooo pretty.  For me, the flavors are still very much there & still very similar to what my nanay or tatay used to cook.  It really is a fusion of Filipino & American.  Yes, somewhat more palletized to the American taste but yet very distinct.    My niece - who is about as Americanized a Filipino that you can get (aka - not into bagoong or balut), rather enjoyed the Bangus Sisig of all dishes!  That in itself can take a bit used to eating especially if you're picky about seafood.  It's fishy but not FISHY - the house sauce and the mango salad balance it out very nicely.    The Lumpianitas were crunchy, tasty with with dipping sauce.  It's like Lay's...you can't eat just ONE!  Well, one basket maybe.  The Pancit Bami was plentiful, with a bounty of meat & veggies over the well-cooked pancit noodles.  I wished for a bit more umami flavor (perhaps a splash of patis or kalamansi) but I think that's an easy fix.  I really liked the Adobo Fried Rice a lot, it was covered in a nice brown lacquer with strong adobo flavor.  Who doesn't like that salty/slightly tart combo?  Delicious with the semi-sweet plantain on top.  The Crispy Lechon Kawali was a favorite for the entire table.  Just think about it.  Thick sliced pork belly, rippling with sweet, sweet pork fat...all fried up until golden brown?  *DROOL*...paired up with their house 'All Purpose Sauce' it was a match made in heaven.  Only real problem we had here at Cutting Board??  White rice is NOT included with your meal!!  Whutttttt!!  All this food goes perfect with a bowl of hot white Jasmine (or Calrose) rice!  You can get some, but it will set you back a little bit extra.  We settled for our fried rice & pancit...however I don't think it's the same.  We were so full from our post-workout meal that we couldn't even fit in dessert!  Cutting Board makes some really interesting ones though...come on, a Bibingka Souffle?  Yah I really wish we had room for one of those.  Maybe next time!!    I think we'll make Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub one of our neighborhood joints!  Gotta go back as soon as I can!  MASARAP!!  #masarap",

Order: Tapsilog, tocilog, adobo  Important to mention that some of the tapa slices were raw. The tocino was nothing like the tocino you'll get in the Philippines. I strongly recommend you buy the Magnolia tocino at Seafood City. That's way better and more Filipino-ish! The adobo tasted okay but the sauce tasted like paksiw sauce.  Also their service is sooooo slow. We waited a good 30 minutes for our food.   Way overpriced! I paid $42 for tapsilog, tocilog and adobo! NOT WORTH IT! Would not eat here again.",

We ordered the Coconut Halo Halo and Bibingka for desert.   Dinner was so good!   We came back for a second time at the end of our impromptu Vegas trip. I had the Beef Caldareta. My Filipino mother would put more olives in her rendition, but this version was just as good (Like the food critic in Pixar Ratatouille). My wife had the Tofu Sisig. We ABSOLUTELY had to finish with the Coconut Halo Halo. Delicious all around!",

Seasoned and baked with garlic baguette slices on the side to act as a vehicle for the gelatinous fatty amazingness.  Some kind of slaw for garnish just to break up the heaviness.  Second is a favorite of mine, fried plantains...nothing special, but perfectly fried.  Third pic is the beef caldereta with garlic fried rice in the background.  Some of the best caldereta I've ever had.  Beef fell apart in my mouth and the tomato based stew was to die for.  Some green olives for a salty bite every once in a while, classic Filipino dish done to perfection.  Garlic rice was good, but may be a bit strong for some.  the pork belly sisig with a fried egg hiding underneath.  The pork belly was finely chopped and fried up so the that outside of the chunks were crispy which gave way to beautiful gooey, fatty perfection when I bit into them.  The crispy parts stuck in my teeth reminding me of some kind of hard candy, except pork flavored.  The last picture is adobo fried rice, which I was going to use with my entrees but found out it was an entree itself.  All in all, this has just made my Vegas top five.  If you get a chance, this place is a must!!!",

Reservation for 13 people.  Everyone in my party, agreed that the food was sumptuous! Knowing that it's Mother's Day, the restaurant should've been prepared with volumes of orders. For the big group we had, our food/order, came out one by one... first then skewer, then the rice, then some fried bananas... it was disappointing. The iced tea didn't have any taste.... We had kids and were all hungry. It took about an hour for all the food to be served. We were the first ones to arrive and yet, was served last....  it's interesting that any place can easily charge your group the gratuity, I understand that we were a big group and that's it's an automatic thing, but the word GRATUITY, means tip for service.... an exceptional service that is --- which we did not get... how dare you collect $32 gratuity for our group for food/dishes that came in one by one? Seriously..... kakainis!",

Although they let me keep the wrong items and didn't charge me for the correct entree, it was still a hassle to have to drive back there. Not to mention, my sister and I split the bill but she was charged for the full bill AND they took my cash for the half that I paid for. She was able to get it fixed the next day but again, that was inconvenient. I'm still on the fence whether I wanna give them a 2nd chance or not. But I gotta admit. The food was very good. Maybe they will redeem themselves if I give them another chance. Until then, I gotta give them a 3 for effort, good food and the friendly staff.",

The seafood dish was tasty but the amount of seafood was disappointing, (3 shrimp on a family size portion and mussels that were only shells)     All in all this was a good place if you are looking for something different and based on the number of diners that were Filipino It seems to be a good spot.

Can't miss with those.  The special lechon is an interesting dish with crispy pork rind and fatty pork belly around paella style rice. Good but not a repeat dish for me. Plantains, lumianitas eggrolls are tasty and popular with the kids.  Overall an enjoyable meal, as long as you know it's time to throw the diet out the window for the night, since filipino food is not the healthiest around.",

Sat at the bar and the staff was very attentive and friendly. Filipino hospitality am I right?   The second time was kind of disappointing. Almost everything we asked for, they did not have. Lechon Roll, Pork Ramen, Red Horse, Sam Adam's...they didn't have anything. What drew out the process was that the waitress did not know what they did or didn't have so it increased the wait time for food. The food that did come out, the portions were HUGE. They should keep in mind that especially with rice someone who is not use to filipino food will probably not finish it all. Everything was delicious except for the fish and shrimp balls, which they burned. Also, they need to learn how to properly pour a beer, I don't enjoy paying $7 for a quarter cup of foam. The beer was flat and foamy.   I really wanted to give this place 4-5 stars based on the first time we were there, but there are some issues they need to work out to make it a better experience.",

    "text": "I know this place has been open for a couple of years. Finally got to try it out! Food was delicious. I live around summerlin area so it wasn't too far of a drive. And if you've lived in Vegas for a while you know you would have to drive around spring mountain if you want Filipino food. Glad there's one on this side of town. I like how open and spacious everything is. I especially like how big the tables are. The wait staff were very nice. Just one thing I didn't like and reason I gave just 4 instead of 5 stars is how the server wasn't too attentive. I kept asking for water. Everytime I kept seeing the other server i was wondering where ours was. The food was very delicious. I set my expectations kinda low since I'm used to the regular Filipino restaurants near China town so I was very surprised. It was about 5 of us and we ordered a couple of appetizers. We got the lumpia Shanghai and longanisa on a stick. Lumpia was moist and cooked just right. We got  bangus sisig and pork sisig. I don't know if it was just me but the bangus sisig was a little salty. The regular sisig was really good. I was expecting it to be spicy but it wasn't. Next is the crispy binagoongan which was one of my favorites. If you like shrimp paste (bagoong) then you'll like this dish. It wasn't too salty. We had the kare kare which was delicious.  We had 3 big pieces of the ox tail and a good amount of green beans and sauce. They even had grilled zucchini and eggplant on the side with bagoong in a small silver bowl. Last dish we had was the lechon kawali. Very crispy! My favorite. Would recommend to come again.",

    "text": "\"Gastropub?  I'm down\" says bud 1.  \"Filipino females are hot!\" says bud 2.  \"Ditto\" says bud 3.  \"So why'd you wanna check this place out?\" he continues.  \"I want to try real Filipino food before deciding if I want to be a gastro-tourist in Metro Manila and Cebu\"  I say to a car full of \"yeah right\" looks.  The food is very approachable.  A blend of Americanized Filipino street food and Spanish influenced dishes (from the Spanish colonization in the 16th century).   Tip:  Use any fermented shrimp sauce if provided.  It might stink but it boost flavor to the next level.  Tip:  Dishes are meant to be shared family style.  Straight to the pig.  Best to worst.  The crispy pata (brined and roasted pork hock) excellent.  Fall off the bone tender with crispy skin.  Aggressively seasoned hinting of a juicy, fatty piece of ham.  Lechon Kawali (deep fried pork belly), while juicy with a nice crisp skin, the texture of the belly including the fat is rubbery and the flavor one dimensional.  I prefer the roasted lechon cooked over a fire seasoned with lemongrass, oregano and other herbs.  The crispy binagoongan (pork belly sauteed with eggplant in fermented shrimp paste topped with tomato and mango) boast a great sweet sour flavor.  Fermented notes help the sweetness of the pork.  Garnishes make the dish refreshing.  Finally the crispy pork sisig (pork belly sauteed with onions, peppers, topped with a fried egg), no.  Way too oily.  I should have listened to fellow yeeps.  The grilled bangus (milk fish), the highlight.  Well seasoned, charred bitterness, flaky and moist flesh topped with a refreshing, herbaceous mango slaw.  More slaw would have made it even better.  The kare kare (oxtail peanut stew), is very good.  Perfectly braised, suckably good oxtail, creamy peanut and beef sauce.  A side of grilled summer squash and eggplant, epically when dipped in fermented shrimp sauce, make the perfect foil.    Finally the crispy tadyang (crispy beef short rib).   Simply braised beef short ribs deep fried to finish.  Very moist and pull apart tender, with a contrasting, chewy texture on the outside.  Comes with \"house gravy\" but adding anything to it is unnecessary.  This is good eats naked.  OK off Strip service.  A little haphazard (unless they expect you to eat with your hands) or only three in your party is thirsty.  Maybe not as authentic as hopped.  Suffice it to say, Midwest poker dude ate and enjoyed everything.",

Big time disappointed. The Pancit Bami and Chicken Inasal today were both disappointingly bland and flat, we knew right away it was prepared by a different chef/cook.  We truly want to support Filipino restaurants and don't mind paying for good food.  We were so happy we discovered Cutting Board but after feeling cheated today, I don't know if we want to take a chance and come back here.  Inconsistent food is a no no!  We were planning on ordering many other dishes on their menu and bringing friends here but it's hard when the quality of the food is inconsistent. If today was our first time here, we wouldn't return for sure.  The service from both James and Reah is excellent, thank you.  But hope the owners check on the customers too especially when it's not busy and make sure food is consistently good.  Cutting Board elevates Filipino food but needs to do better to guarantee consistency.",

Adobo fried rice was kind of salty. The one dish I really liked was surprisingly a vegetable dish with squash and green beans in a coconut curry sauce (can't remember the name). I took my Filipino parents here when they visited and both were unimpressed. The only thing my dad and I liked were the plantains that were a side with the rice. I will unlikely return here but maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes.",

    "text": "Hate writing bad review because who likes reading (and writing) them but, this place was a major fail for me.  I was really hoping to like this place, too. The Filipino food movement in Vegas has surely grown since I moved here.   The set up reminded me of Boilng Crab without the major wait. Considering there were 18 of us, the wait wasn't bad at all.   We looked thru the menu and ended up ordering per table to make it easier for the waitress & there were 4 tables.   I had already had a big lunch so I had my mind set on the side of plantains with steam rice. My friend ordered the chicken insala and said \"don't order the rice cuz you can eat the rice that comes with my chicken.\" Ok, coooool.  Well, 2 of the 4 ppl on my table orders and the waitress, Jill, moves to the next table ...uhmmmm, hellooooooo....half the table didn't order our food.   Ok. Whatever.   So I leave for a bit to say hello to some coworker who were also eating there.   I come back to my table and my plantains are there. My friends' chicken insala comes and there's red rice on her plate. She tells me, \"idk the waitress told me it comes with steam rice.\"  Well, I end up ordering the steam rice and, I kid you not, the rest of my tables' lumpia, bone marrow, hamachi, lechon, fried rice come out before my steamed rice.  Yes, I'll snack on their food but...  WHERES MY RICE!?!!!  Is this place like a Chinese restaurant where the steam rice comes out last?  I order the rice again and it finally comes.   Plantains are plantains. Can't go wrong with that. I wish it was fried a little more so the plantains were crispy caramelized.   Lechon kawali was very oily. Definitely fried the pork then put it on the plate. Love the shoyu sauce with comes with tho. We would take my plantains, dip it in the shoyu sauce, and boom. Chicken insala was dry; good marinade tho.   Another friend of mines, waits for her squid ink paella and was tempted to cancel the order bcuz it took soooooo long. Finally, paella comes and the rice wasn't cooked. Hard. Hard rice :( WTF!   ***I know I'm ranting about rice!*** ***i love rice, ok!***  Other food I tried:  Sisig -- it's not Cafe Moda sisig. Not even close! I found that to be too oily, as well.  Hamachi -- it was salty. Idk how u get that wrong...just grill it!  Bread pudding -- I liked the coconut ice cream!  Bibingka souffle -- it had no taste to me. Looked like soft scrambled eggs. After we left, my coworker who was also there told me I was supposed to add the salted egg and creme (on the plate) into the souffle --- wth, no one told us that!  Bone marrow -- the biggest bones I ever did see ***4 stars*** the toast was a little too overpowering with the marrow once on top but, I like bone marrow!  Calamansi crush -- eh, just order the Calamansi juice on ice!   To add to the lackluster food, service was all over the place! We have Jill 2 credit cards to for our bill and she gives us one and comes back with the other 15 minutes later...why?!  My friend had a crying baby she had to bring home but, couldn't because she was waiting on her credit card. Shouldn't they both come at the same time if they were given at the same time =(   Super disappointing. Would've loved adding this to the list of my go-to Filipino spots (Thelma's, Nanay Gloria's, Cafe Moda) but, nothing about The Cutting Board did it for me.",

    "text": "Lunch: Restaurant was not busy but service was slow.  It took 10mins after sitting and 20mins after ordering to get my dish.  My server Anita was very nice though and took time to help me narrow down a few dishes.  2 servers and 1 buser for 7 tables.  Food is thoughtfully presented and portions are for sharing.  The table of three next to me each packed leftovers after ordering just 1 plate each with an order or garlic rice for sharing.  Lechon Ramen Noodle Soup $10 Ingredients: over 10 pieces of fried pork, sliced hardboiled egg, sake braised mushroom, seaweed, and micro greens. Taste: 3.5/5 Oily and salty broth.  The pork was slightly overfried so the skin stuck to my teeth like caramel chunks rather than being crispy.  Overall great value for quantity of food and it's a clean  and bright atmosphere.  I would not order the noodle soup again but I'm interested in trying other dizhes on their menu.  The location is easily accessible from 95 so I recommend venturing here for a company group lunch.  Owners are from the Bay Area and one of the co-owners is the main chef in the kitchen who is soft spoken and very nice when one of the customers requested to speak with him about catering.  Real bummer there's no wifi given the slower service you may burn through your data quickly.",

The food was excellent we had lechon kawali I did have to ask for the vinegar sauce it didn't come with the plate but flavor wise it was awesome. The chicken adobo was just like mom used to make, reminded me of being back home. My girlfriend loved the fried plantains and next time we go back she's getting a full plate of those. The coconut halo halo had excellent taste and the presentation was amazing. I'm only giving 4 stars because I ordered the adobo fried rice and it was not was i was expecting, great flavor but I was expecting to eat adobo fried rice, it tasted more like garlic fried rice with small pieces of chicken adobo in it.",

Their pork sig tacos were my favorite. All the flavors were on point from the mango salsa to the pork. I  would definitely order this item again if I came back.  Their ribs were alright but it was very tender and the meat pulls right off the bone! I would recommend ordering a side of garlic rice to go with this dish!  Over all great experience will definitely want to try other items on their menu",

The short ribs was one giant rib with extremely fatty meat on it. It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth $20. As for the meatballs they were sweet which was a little unexpected but  they weren't bad either. They did fall apart the second you try to pick one up with your fork. Overall I feel as though there are a lot of great options on this menu but I may not have picked the best ones. I will return to try more.   Also, a lot of reviews are saying the service wasn't good but my server was great! She was sweet and attentive and very personable.",

    "text": "The only reason it wasn't a perfect rating on this visit is because they were giving out their new menu which had items that were not yet available so we had to keep deciding on other items. Other than that, I returned to give them another try - my first initial visit (few weeks after opening) was very disappointing. First, I was pregnant and hungry - not a good time to experience bad food. It took some time for our food to arrive, and when it did - it was cold. As if it had been sitting under the light because no one knew who it belonged to. I think there were just too many hands everywhere. Definitely different flavors from the traditional - but that was to be expected and I applaud them on their creativity. This time around, I wanted to stick to the \"tapas\" as I wanted to try more choices and it was definitely a good decision. Perfect size to share and try. I returned to a new and improved menu, definitely one that'll intrigue you to come back (especially if your neighbor ordered items you drooled over on the menu). For sure I will be back to try the lechon roll with paella filling (I hope it's not spicy). Note: this has to be ordered 24hrs in advance",

After considering several options we decided on the Bantus Sisig, House Fried Rice and Chicken Adobo.  All very good and we have much leftover from the generous portions.  Paul was a good waiter and we recommend this restaurant for a nice trip away from chain places.",

The cost is affordable and the staff are great and courteous. The GM comes around and talks to you and it is a big place with live music on the weekends. I never think twice when I eat here.",

    "text": "Considering Cutting Board for your family or an event please read:  Last night I took my wife and mother-in-law to The Cutting Board - Filipino Gastropub for a birthday party. My mother-in-law is allergic to shrimp. Therefore, when she ordered - my wife made CRYSTAL CLEAR there would be no shrimp of any sort in her dish. After her eyes swelling up, sweating, and starting to tremble - it was evident she had consumed shrimp. After some time and a lot of benadryl - she is fine. However, her daughter and son-in-law are infuriated. When the waitress was confronted she made it evident to our table that she had made the notation on the bill, but the cook ignored it.  The only action taken by the restaurant was to remove the dish from the bill. Had there been more shrimp consumed or it happened to someone more allergic - there may have been a fatal incident.  I just spoke with Tiffany, the managing partner. In my life - I have never heard such a fake apology for such a gross mistake in my life.  Three time's she repeated, \"It already happened, what do you want me to do about it.\" She already knew that I contacted her wanting a full refund for the groups bill and the cook to be fired.  Here is how I feel they should have handled it:  1. Fire the cook! The fact that he is still employed there is dangerous to anyone with food allergies in the Vegas community.  2. Refund our groups bill. No explanation needed.  The food was actually good ladies and gentleman, but I refuse to sit idle while a local restaurant that my friends and family can visit is run in such a deplorable manner. Do not ever go to this place.   SHAME ON THE CUTTING BOARD FILIPINO GASTROPUB!  SHAME ON MANAGING PARTNER TIFFANY LE!",

The pancit was so soggy and again, salty, that I had to avoid it. BUT! The Tadyang was absolutely delicious that I had to come back... So I thought, perhaps the other items on the menu can't be as bad!   Ordered Tadyang, bangus sisig, garlic fries, kare-kare. Boy was I wrong! We were given our drinks once! No refill was offered at all! Calling a server took at least 32 minutes (yes I timed it). And they never asked us how the food was doing at all!   The bangus sisig was okay, I like how I could taste the lime in there. But some parts were tough as if it was mixes in with reheated bangus. The garlic fries was ok! Kare-kare had 2 pieces of oxtail with like a powder-mix sauce that was awful!!!! I just couldn't... And lastly, looking forward to get that Tadyang! Oh dear... It was tough like it was refried 10x that it was so hard to eat! Plus the size was at least half of the size we received the first time I was there! As I bit into that Tadyang, I could taste the reused oil.   No thanks! Bad food. Bad service. Try something else if I were you!!!!",

Normally when I order food , I usually asked for less seasoning especially on salt. My husband enjoyed the bone marrow for appetizer and beef tadyang for entree. I like the Kare-Kare. The food portions are pretty small but more than enough for me and my husband. We made sure we have room to try their bibingka souffle, served with cheese, salted egg and syrup( looks like condense milk) . I ate it without any of the sides and like it that way. The only thing that we didn't like, the drinks were served in a plastic glasses. The food is pretty pricey for a Filipino food but as long as the food are really good, who are we to complain on the price. Overall, our dining experience in this new establishment was excellent.",

Of course you have the usual Filipino food too for the not very adventurous. The setting is casual and they have a bar with a great choice of wines or beer.

I just absolutely love it. The lumpanitas, of course, as you would expect. (addictive!) but I keep thinking about the crispy pork (chopped pork belly) each day I go without having it. My boyfriend is big into paella, and at first they did it authentically with squid ink, but I can understand how other people wouldn't be into the idea of it. Realistically, though, it was delicious, and you're missing out on not having it. They changed the paella to not include squid ink anymore, I forget what they substituted, but it's a more western paella now. (You're regretful, haters!!!!!) The adobo is, of course, amazing...the chicken inasal, the same. Also, they have microbrews that I love; purple haze, for instance, my favorite. I knew this place was authentic when we went in and were the only white people there. If you like Filipino food, you won't regret going here. If you're not sure if you like filipino food, you won't regret going here. Go already!",

    "text": "After finding this resto on google, my family and I gave it a try for lunch. Aesthetics: Interior is spacious and the deco is pretty hip and modern with pictures of the food they are serving.  Big screen TVs also show samples of the food they serve and some regular TV shows (not TFC).  Service: The waiter with the deep voice was very helpful and friendly.  Food/Drinks: The food we ordered were very tasty even though they were not big servings.  The taco sisig we thought was good even though the meat was not that tender. The Pancit Bami was the \"bomb\"and the Ube souffle was also delicious.  They have a decent selection of drinks. Cons:  They close pretty early at night and they don't have regular weekend live entertainment--only on special occasions I think.",

    "text": "Off the strip, closer to North Las Vegas. Drop by if you head to the premium outlets here.  What I liked is they look classic Filipino dishes and changed it up just a bit with a twist. For example, the bibingka or ube souffle.   The prices are a bit higher and for some it was too much. Now a days the price of ox-tail has gone up. When I was growing up this cut of the cow was cheap but now everyone loves ox-tail increased the price. For example a decent size bowl of Kare Kare is $19. We didn't get it because we chose so many more items that we could pass this. I did sneak a peak at our neighbors and it came with grilled vegetables on the side and the sauce looked really creamy. The bowl looked like it would feed 2 people if that was the only item.  Started with the ube pancake since it was free with a yelp check in. It was moist probably due to the ube. I had it served with maple syrup but some pictures showed it with a purple syrup. Don't know what it is really served with which sucks since it wasn't consistent can't really judge if you wanted an entire stack. The ube flavor wasn't really obvious in the pancake which I liked. And it was good with maple syrup.  Pinakbet: served with shrimp. Also just vegetable version is also on the menu. Wasn't too soupy. Well flavored but not so salty. The vegetables were crisp. And went well with the Lechon kawali.  Lechon kawali: so good! Crisp pork belly with a soy sauce and Lechon sauce. Served with their version of atchara which is with cabbage and mango.  Bangus Sisig: probably fried whole sisig and then the meat was broken up and cooked with bell peppers. Topped with tomatoes and their atchara. It was well cooked. I loved fried bangus and they used the bangus as part of their presentation.  The rice is separate from the dishes.  And for dessert, bibingka souffle. It came with a salted egg to mix in and the cream. When I first tried the souffle minus the add ins it just tasted like the egg whites. Better with the cream, I didn't do the egg since that's not my jam. I did feel that the souffle could have been in the oven just a bit more. It rises and kept its poof but in it, it was too foamy.... like I know it shouldn't be firm but it was almost more liquid foam.... does that make sense? Lol.  Each dish including dessert is from $7-$15.  They have an assortment of cocktails and is open for breakfast.  Overall I loved the flavors. I loved how they had a lot of vegetables and how they cooked the vegetables making them still with a bite.",

They mess too much with recipes so it's difficult ordering many dishes that I'm use to eating all my life as they taste totally different & not in a good way. Crispy pita (pita means feet). They give a small shank no pita for  $19. Pricy for 1/2 the size as other Filipino restaurant.  They make there dishes sweet & very saucy, that are not traditionally. So bottom line I'm out, rather go to D'Pinoy Joint or others for a better meal at a lower cost.",

I wanted to order almost everything on their menu to try it but of course, that's not possible.   What we ordered: 1. Lechon kawali with eggs and fried rice 2. Escargot 3. Sisig  And we had complimentary ube pancake from Yelp Check-in.   Everything we ordered tasted heavenly. Their sisig is one of the best sisig I've had even though it did not have pig's ear (maybe to appeal to non-Filipino customers). Lechon kawali was cooked perfectly with crispy skin but not hard meat... and let me tell you about their Escargot! It was phenomenal! (If you like spicy food).  It had spicy curry mixed in coconut milk and the snails are no longer in their shells so it made eating more convenient and less messy!  Ube pancake had ube syrup and it was heavenly!   This will definitely be the first restaurant I'd visit so we  can try the rest of their menu when I return to Las Vegas... yes, I'd skip Jollibee, Chowking, Red Ribbon, and Grill City for Cutting Board!",

Anyway, every so often I like to try a new place that features cultural foods. And tonight, I went specifically to enjoy a plate of sizzling sisig. As soon as we entered, we were graciously greeted by the older gentleman at the register. We settled in, picked up our menus, and I immediately knew what we were going to have for dinner.  *Roasted Bone Marrow *Crispy pork sisig with egg *Garlic rice  To be quite honest, we came for the sisig but the roasted bone marrow definitely stole the show. The generous portion was roasted to bone marrow perfection. And served with garlic toast; you can't go wrong. I'd say that the appetizer is the sole winner of all 4 stars.  I was excited to have the crispy pork sisig after the numerous photos on Yelp. The flavor was okay - I think it could have used a little bit more of a citrus taste. The dish was also a bit more oily than I am used to. However, we added a bit of sisig on top of our bone marrow toast and found a whole new reason to love the appetizer even more! However for the sisig itself, I think I would give it up for an alternate dish in the future.  Garlic fried rice has been a staple in my home from before I could remember. My grandparents would fill the rooms with the aroma of fresh garlic almost every day when I was young. The version of the rice we had for dinner was not comparable at all. It tasted as if it was cooked with dry rice and bottled garlic. Definitely lacking a lot of flavor.  Overall, the experience wasn't terrible. And we would definitely come back to try it again. Although, next time I will have to think of something a little different to pair with my 4-star bone marrow",

I waited for a seat at the front and NO ONE was there to greet me. Eventually, after reading the menu and waiting around someone finally talked to me. He told me he'd be back in a few minutes. In fairness, the place was busy and he was running around between the kitchen and dining area. So I waited some more. And then the same gentleman came back and told me it'd be a few minutes more. After waiting around for fifteen minutes and being unable to place a to-go order, I decided to leave. Again, I can't review their food but their service was awful. Such a shame.",

My heart goes out to James and his crew because everyone is only human and things can get crazy inside the kitchen. In the end, this place had amazing food! Like the \"I'm full of but it's so good that I want to eat more\" kind of full.   My table ordered the special kamayan package with alcoholic drinks and Lechon kawali. We chose the crispy pata and inasal for our order. I personally ordered a calamansi mule which was perfect! Perfect balance of enough alcohol and drink flavoring. It wasn't super strong nor watered down. I enjoyed a refreshing drink while still feeling the right amount of buzz during dinner and in front of family lol.   Long live Cutting Board!

We had a Halo Halo; a coconut ice-cream dessert, an Ube souffle and some Fried Suman. The Halo Halo and Ube were delicious, the Suman less convincing. Our Server Will was great; he brought the chef mommy Glo and introduced her to us, an amazing grandma running the whole kitchen. One downer was the weak air conditioning, clearly insufficient for the tripe digit summer heat, but I would definitely return to their main dishes.",

We appreciated how they try to do more with traditional Filipino dishes by adding or substituting elements so it's a fresh take yet still familiar. The fried pork belly is used in a few of their dishes so we decided to try it. It was a little under-seasoned but at least it was tender. The gambas was on the sweet side but the shrimp was cooked well and they added longganisa where others have used chorizo or some type of sausage. The bibinka souffle for dessert was good. But we need to try other interesting dishes like ube pancake, lechon stuffed with paella, the silog breakfast, etc. I hope to see this place continue to grow, may the food just keep getting better so it becomes THE go-to Filipino restaurant in Vegas.",

The purple yam pancakes are also phenomenal. I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for food cheap d that is sweet, spicy or savory. If you're feeling adventurous you may also try some of their umami dishes. I have no doubt that I will be a repeat customer so I can explore the options.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, I reallllly did! Judging by the remarkable reviews, I had high hopes but it just didn't cut it for me.  So I came here with my family and was greeted by a nice young lady. She was super friendly, efficient, and even told us some specials. So +A for service. The presentation of the food is also very Instagram-worthy. It is very modern with their rustic wood plating and newspaper design. Their menus are also super cute, clipped to a very thick large wood as well. You gotta appreciate the small details they put into their look.   So lets start with the mishaps: We ordered: calamari, pork adobo, lobster mac and cheese, sinigang, and lechon.  -The calamari came out first and was delicious but my brother found a long piece of black hair stuck in one of the pieces. I'm not one to complain about a measly piece of hair, but damn was it long and thick! lol.  -As for the sinigang, the broth was super flavorful but I couldn't really enjoy it because it wasn't even hot; more on the verge of lukewarm. Another bummer.  -Finally, the lobster mac and cheese. I wanted to taste a non-filipino dish and once again, it was a let down. The mac and cheese was soo oily! It left a weird aftertaste in my mouth that I had to wash it down with water or the lukewarm sinigang just to reset my palate.   Okay so I have to leave on a good note right? -The lechon was everything lechon should be: crunchy, with a little bit of fat, balanced with a good proportion of meat. YES. Cooked to perfection.  -The pork adobo was what I looked forward to the most and it was the only dish that really stood out for me! I was pleasantly surprised due to the mishaps of the other dishes. It was hot, didn't have hair on it, and not too oily. YES!  Overall, I think this place has some execution flaws when it comes to their dishes. Each dish would have been great, but there's there's just that one major flaw that kind of ruins it altogether. I might come back here and give it another go since there's just so many good reviews. I just want to like it so bad! haha.",

    "text": "Okay, people. We hear you. \"It's not authentic.\" \"It doesn't taste like my mom's!\" We get it.  But really. Is any Filipino's cooking the same as the next ones? No.  My mom is Filipino. And guess what, her brother's cooking tastes nothing like hers. Neither does her mother's cooking. And so on... Every Filipino has a different style of cooking. Some of them REALLY suck at it, and some of them are amazing.  I'm lucky, because my mom's cooking happens to be amazing.   Going foward: This place is a gastropub. They're looking for a different type of theme, and I totally dig it. Especially since they have good beer. This place is super good, in my opinion. Especially the Pork Sisig. Some people said it was too greasy. Mine wasn't overly greasy--but again. For fucks sake, people. Do you know what pork sisig is? A shit ton of fat. That's what most of the pork is. And THAT's why it's so flavorful.  Some days, I really hate Yelp. Other days, it's great because it helps me decide on what I want to stuff my face with.  I also had the chicken adobo. I really like the dish. I wish it was a little less garlicy, but it was still super tasty. Just prepare yourself.   The prices are super reasonable for the portions you recieve as well.   I'll be back again soon, so I can keep trying an array of dishes. Because that's what I do. Eat my little black heart out.",

    "text": "Look, I am proud to be Filipino, but I am honestly not a big fan of Filipino food (hold off from throwing the kamatis at me please!)... but wow, this gastropub concept with an awesome fusion menu has such a delicious spin on traditional Filipino cuisine! Dishes from the Philippines aren't really considered to be mainstream, but I believe this place may be the one to steer it into that direction -- and I am totally on board (the cutting board that is)! ;)  We ordered: - FISH BALLS ($3.00) & SHRIMP BALLS ($3.00): A popular filipino street food, these were a must order for me. Lightly fried with a chewy texture, I would order 10 of these if they were cheaper! lol.  - CHICKEN SKEWER ($3.00): Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned chicken. (We ordered two of these!) - LUMPIANITAS ( $8.00): A good portion of crunchy ground pork & vegetable deep fried mini-eggrolls. - PORK SISIG ($12.00): Served still sizzling, a generous amount of pork diced with onions so incredibly full of flavor! A must try! - GARLIC RICE ($6.00): Had to get some rice to eat all of the meat with. Plain white rice is only $2.00 but we wanted the flavor of garlic to pair with our meal!  - TOCINO KOBE BURGER ($15.00): This was a cute spin, but honestly not as authentic tasting as the rest of the meal. Tocino, which is sweet roasted pork, on top of a kobe beef burger with all the toppings and mixed fries! (I honestly was probably just too full from all the above to enjoy, lol.) This is definitely a more American choice if you're not feeling too traditional. - CALAMANSI JUICE ($4.00): I always need something sweet to wash down the saltiness of a meal. This paired absolutely perfectly! Drink slow though; no refills!  $60.00 of food later, we definitely did not leave room for dessert (I wanted halo halo so bad, but we even had lots of left overs to take home)! But not only was the food very impressive, but the venue is very large with a karaoke area, parquet dance floor & a DJ booth too... great for an event! Service was great as well (thank you, Anita!).   Hope this place is here to stay because we will definitely be back! Who knew that one day the girl who disliked filipino cuisine would be converted! :D",

The menu ( see pictures) has excellent choices and I felt the potions were generous and price points very reasonable.  I enjoyed the house favorite of bone marrow served with garlic croutons and pork sisig tacos. Both excellent.  I was amazed and perhaps  because it's Sunday the number of excellent looking Souffles which where carried past my table    I hope these folks do well and if you want adventure for your palette give this restaurant a try.

    "text": "The name says it all: Cutting Board (what many of the dishes are served on, there's attention to presentation and many meat dishes) Filipino (style of cuisine served here) Gastropub (they have beer and the food is modernized). This is not the place to expect a 5 pound Styrofoam takeout box full of cafeteria-style food that tastes like your grandma made it, for under $10.   BONE MARROW APP ($10) Two huge bones, great presentation with crostini and mango slaw. The marrow and bread are both seasoned, which was a bit much but the marrow itself was good. The slaw was necessary to balance this dish. Unexpected and cool to have this dish available at a more casual restaurant, usually have to go on the Strip if I want it. GRILLED BANGUS ($14): Large sour-tasting grilled milkfish, served with fish sauce and garnished with slaw. BF loves this dish and was happy with this version, I was glad to have a lighter, healthier option instead of just greasy pork plates as elsewhere. PANCIT ($9): Recommended by our server as one of her favorite dishes, a traditional dish mixing two types of noodles with a variety of meats and some vegetables (cabbage, carrots, celery). This dish was greasy but not overwhelmingly so, paired well with the fish and had shrimp, sausage, and pork. Shareable, family-size portion. MANGO SLAW ($6): More because I really liked it. Julienned mango with kale, carrots, and a few other vegetables seasoned with a vinegar sauce. Fresh and acidic, and went well with everything we tried, lightening and brightening up flavors.  Service was attentive during our visit without being overbearing or annoying. Prices are low for this style of restaurant (I am referring to their modernized gastropub-fusion concept, NOT Filipino food in general) and the portion sizes they offer.  I will note that comparing photos of our dishes to others' here on Yelp, the same dish looks quite different across several photos, which seems to indicate that they need to work on consistency.  I do not claim to be particularly versed in Filipino cuisine, but I liked the dishes I tried. Majority of poor reviews seem to be expecting a more traditional experience, flavors, and pricing, but I like that this spot is offering something different, and I'm looking forward to bringing friends in to try more dishes like the escargot, crispy shrimp, squid ink paella.",

We decided to order crispy pata, crispy garlic shrimp, garlic fried rice, lumpia, bone marrow,sisig bangus and a lovely calamansi Martini. I give this place four stars for the food and cocktail and the service was not bad at best so I give them three stars out of five. In the servers defense she was trying but they had her short handed while her coworker was out smoking in the parking lot!",

We ordered beer and had to ask 3 times for beer. There were like 8 people in the entire dining area. This was not a busy day or hour. This is the first time I've ever been to a restaurant where I actually ate half my meal without ever receiving a drink. When the beer did come I had to ask about the water again cuz you know it's 115 outside and the restaurant is using air blowers for ventillation. The server was loud but polite. He would say \" you're very welcome\" and \"I'll get on that right away\". I actually felt bad for asking about my beer 3 times but I kind of wanted a drink with my food really bad. Very disappointed with the service. Food was great.",

We Actually ordered quite a bit which the waitress did warn us it was family style. I ordered a mango mojito to drink which wAs the bomb. However they do seem to have a nice selection of brew for those who like beer. For our entrees we had some garlic rice, Crispy Pata and Tamarind Ribs. Both were delicious!!!! Didn't have enough room to try dessert. Overall happy with the experience. The only reason I didn't rate the full five stars is due to the dining layout and the chairs not being comfortable but other than that, definitely plan on returning.",

Since we only had 30 minutes to eat before they close, we ordered everything from appetizer, main course to dessert. We specifically ordered the bibingka souffle since we heard good reviews about it.  We had fishball for appetizer. Not so great. It was tough --- like they didn't wait for it to defrost a little before deep frying it. We ordered daing na bangus only to be told that they didn't have it --- but they had bangus sisig. We ordered pork sisig and was told that that too was not available ---- but they had lechon kawali.  After about 20 minutes, we were ready for our desert only to be told that the bibingka was no longer available since they didn't have enough time to bake it. Duh? That's the reason why we asked for it early so they could prepare it ahead of time. The server said it takes 15 minutes to bake it and shld be eaten at once. It shld not matter when we eat our bibingka--- just serve it to us!!!  But even after the frustration, We will still probably come back to this place just so we can taste the sisig and the souffle ... p.S. Kawali ang the bone marrow was good",

It's a bit salty but all Filipino food usually is. Nothing hot white rice can't fix!  The deconstructed Kare kare could only be made better if the meat was a tad more tender. The bibingka souffle was to die for. Also just so u know.. the lechon roll needs to be ordered 24 hours in advance.",

The menu is presented on a cutting board and clipped on which I thought was cute.   However, I didn't get to try the food because no one decided to come get our orders. We sat for 15 minutes and not one server came to greet us or get our drinks. But they were serving everyone else? I know the servers saw us sitting there because they were looking at if any tables needed anything and saw us doing nothing and yet still no service.  I saw another table get seated a bit after us and they got serviced immediately. Seriously? What kind of bullshit is this? The hostess was nice but the servers here are horrible. There were a few other people walking around who maybe looked like owners or managers and even they didn't bother to come greet us. Do I look like I'm a kid waiting for my parents or maybe my ethnicity wasn't to their liking? I don't feel comfortable in there.   Would not recommend this place nor am I ever coming back to give it a try.",

The lechon kawali was perfect, not too fatty. Will definitely come back here when we're in town.",

We tried the pork sisig tacos, lumpianitas, and bone marrow as our appetizers. All were pretty good, but the bone marrow was the stand out dish to DIE FOR!   Bangus sisig and the Tamarind ribs were our entrees. The bangus was bangin, and the ribs were just alright.   Overall definitely would recommend this place.   Oh and knocked of a star because they didn't have coke products, not a big deal but kind of a big deal for my little lady.",

    "text": "Food: We had a chance to try different entrees this is Filipino fusion , some of them had a twist that I did not expect. Paella's choice of lipid is typically olive oil, the paella's twist at the gastro pub was the butter in the paella and surprisingly the flavor was very good. The sisig also had different sour component, which turned to have different savory outcome. Of all the entree I tried I think sisig was the best. We had the fried chicken which tried to emulate Max's fried chicken , it was a good take on Max's. The kawali was crunchy and tender,  The escargot was also new they did it via ginataan which is coconut milk with garlic bread on the side. The bone marrow could have been better executed, the marrow was just too rich for me , the marrow would be like butter slathered on the bread. The bistek had a better presentation than any of the local Filipino restaurants in the valley, they turned out to be good too. Although I was a bit disappointed since I wanted to try out their bibinka souflee however they did not have it during dinner service. Each entree were presented very well and not how the typical Filipino serves their food. The calamari, the bistek, kawali, bone marrow were served with their own fusion twist and each was good except the bone marrow.  Ambiance: cutting board had some great decor , eclectic yet interesting wall decors. It was definitely Filipino fusion pub.  Service: Service was excellent, however the temp inside the restaurant was very cold, It would have been a better dining experience had the temp been optimal for dining.   Overall: It's a great place to bring guest over, and a really good introduction to Filipino food for my American friends. Had a discussion with one of my friends while dining at the pub. The couple  tried the food when it was busy since they opened  and they didn't think the food was good, however since they came back , and tried the food where it wasn't that busy , there was a huge difference in quality. For people that tried cutting board while it was newly opened , please try it again as it might change your opinion. Will definitely come back and try their bibinka souflee, cutting board if you are reading this review please adjust the temperatures inside the restaurant optimally so the patrons can enjoy the delectable Filipino food.",

Things happen, accidents etc. And, as patrons it is our responsibility to be cautious yet courteous, and bring things to the attention of the manager, owner etc.  These businesses are their lives.  There is no need to be rude even if it is something you don't like. Again we thank the staff and Ms. Le for being prompt and courteous. We will be back because it is great food.",

The staff is amazing and the one waiter, Justin I believe, remembers us and our orders because we have gone so often. Even better is that they played all of the basketball games during the playoffs. They went as far as changing the channel for us to be able to watch more than one game of baseball during MLB season to make our experience better, as well. The garlic noodles are also delicious if you are in the mood for pasta, and the presentation is nice. The only part that varies is the bone itself for the Parmesan Garlic Roasted Marrow. This is at no fault of the restaurant itself just means you may need to order more than one! That's not too much of a negative to me at only $10 a pop. Definitely recommended!",

I like to let the egg sit for a bit so it's a little more cooked. It's very tasty and definitely needs a side of rice with it (too bad it doesn't come with). The dish is pretty big and was definitely enough to share. The garlic rice was good but not my favorite as it was on the dryer side. I prefer my rice wetter. The lumpianitas were pretty standard.   The servers were all very friendly, but on several occasions we noted that the service was a little slow or items were forgotten. I think this is due to the restaurant opening just this year, so it hasn't stopped me from going back.  It's a little pricey for Filipino food, so I only go here every now and then when I want to have a night out. Overall, I had a good experience and would recommend this place to my friends.",

The Kare Kare was undercooked and the Crispy Pata were very hard and seemed over cooked. Very disappointing. Even the dessert didn't taste that good today ordering their specialty biningka and ube souffle at $10 a pop ordering 6 of them. Hope they fix this issue very soon as they will lose clients fast.",

    "text": "I remember when this place just opened up I got to meet one of the owners. We talked about the Filipino Music Scene here in Vegas a bit and how she wanted to actually have some bands perform here. It was a short conversation since they were catering to an event that was ongoing that night so everyone was busy. Mind you this was like a year ago. I just happen to remember by chance.   Anyway onto the place itself. Some say this place is kind of cursed or haunted or unlucky. It sits right in front of Lake Mead off ramp from the Southbound 95. So a lot of people may or may not be able to find this place right away. The interior looks more of an American Diner than you would a Filipino Restaurant. Mind you it isn't your traditional Filipino Restaurant so there really isn't any argument to be had in terms of design and motiff.   The service was good considering they had an event ongoing while serving regular customers(me and my friend were also part of the event but we acted like we were just regular customers, I don't know this was a year ago so don't ask me why). Both sides of the restaurant was coincidentally divided by a row of metal post. Kind of like the ones you see where bikes can be chained onto. The right side of the restaurant was where the event wasthe left side were regular customers. Me and my friend chose to sit on the left side of the posts. The server greets us and asked us for drinks which was served after a few minutes. Then she gladly took her time to answer our questions even though I already knew what I was looking at. We ordered the sisig and Lechon Ramen. It took a little while since they were busy trying to accomodate a good stream of regular customers while trying to manage the event as well. A couple of minutes later we got our food. The sisig was good. It wasn't your typical Pampanga style sisig which most Pinoy restaurants have instead this was",

I was on my way to my doctors appointment in the area and I drove past The Cutting Board... Under it said \"Filipino Cuisine\" or something like that... I was surprised bc not many Filipino restaurants look grand and established at this one... I told myself I HAVE to try this place out (even though I'm not the biggest fan of Filipino food..). One week later I still stuck to my word. I finally visited with my boyfriend and best friend. As soon as we walked in the atmosphere and vibe was so energetic. There was a DJ and it was nicely furnished inside. Not to mention... AMAZING customer service! Everyone was welcoming and had high energy. We were lucky to have James as our server... (: Extremely generous and genuinely kind-hearted. He took very well care of us and made extreme efforts to give us our absolute best experience. Thank you, Cutting Board... For not making me lose faith in Filipino restaurants!! Lol   **However only thing I would say that was quite odd was a lot of the entrees with meat didn't come with rice automatically and we had to order the rice seperately... Considering it is a Filipino restaurant. But I'm not complaining. Just interesting",

Officially titled \"Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub,\" the extended descriptor part invitation to those unfamiliar and perhaps a bit cautionary to natives that the food is not exactly \"authentic\" to the style served back home, the restaurant took over an Asian buffet on Rock Springs Drive just off Lake Meade Boulevard near I-95 just a few months prior and having gained mixed reviews from trusted persons it was with a wide focus that a menu already undergoing several changes that an order was compiled, the dozen plates largely successful with portions that are not only generous, but often quite excessive.  Decorated in a manner not particularly ethnic, but more befitting a \"gastropub\" with limited decor aside from televisions showing sports, the layout of Cuttingboard features several hightops with backless industrial stools plus those uncomfortable steel shop-chairs at many standard four-tops, the better bet being to request one of the larger options suited for groups or communal dining that provide padded seats beneath the din of Pop-staples like \"No Scrubs\" from the 90's and early 2000's.  Listening to several specials while also seeing plates come out from the kitchen to others, the clientele largely Filipino families early before transitioning to a mix of Caucasians, African Americans and Latinos closer to two o'clock, it was merely minutes before the order started arriving, the $170 all-in cost without drinks quickly flooding the table with first bites of both the Silver fish and Escargot in Spicy Coconut proving to be robustly flavored even before being spread on slices of baguette liberally soaked in garlic.  Unable to resist fried plantains, the ripe fruit lent a gentle savory note here that was replaced by a crisp Shell plus sweet Chocolate Sauce in the Turon a la Mode served for dessert, attention was immediately diverted to a duo of plates that would prove amongst the best of the meal both in terms of size as well as portion, the sizzling Pork Belly Sisig served on cast iron quickly filling the air with a delectable aroma of Onions and Peppers while the Crispy Ham Hock was easily enough to be split by a family of four as the shattering skin gave way to the melted fat and collagen plus rich meat beneath it.  More than a little impressed by the complex Sauces native to the Philippines, everything from the Spicy Coconut to Lechon/Liver Sauce and Aged-Soy going well with both the items they arrived with as well as fluffy Garlic Rice, another surprise was found in the funky Fish Sauce that added another dimension of flavor to the rich Oxtail Kare Kare with tender bits of Tripe mixed in, the meaty Pacit Bami another intense dish chockablock full of Garlic while a daily special of thick-cut Beef Tongue was almost French in its inspiration, bathing with Peas and Olives in a Mushroom Cream Sauce.  Heavily pushed to by servers to taste the Bibingka Souffle, a dish that others have declared as everything from \"delicious\" to \"disappointing,\" opinions at the table tended to feel the latter more accurate as mild sweetness did little to mask the nearly raw, eggy center - a far better concept presented by a dish described as Suman with Mango Sauce and Toasted Coconut served over a roll of Sweetened Sticky Rice with mashed Ube at the center.",

The souffle dessert is to die for.  When you eat there, order the souffle for dessert.",

    "text": "Meh... If the service was better and if the restaurant didn't smell (like raw meat) I would've enjoyed the food I ordered. Mind you it seemed like the AC was not working as great since they had commercial blowers in there. (It was still hot and I'm always cold.)  Our server was a bit shy with no enthusiasm or welcoming spirit. We had to ask a few times to refill our waters and wave him down for napkins etc. We ordered our food and 2 drinks and It took about 20 minutes to get 1 alcoholic beverage and 25 minutes for the 2nd one. The lychee drink didn't taste good. It was missing something. The calamansi martini was good.   Food:  Sisig Tacos Crispy Pata Sisig Bangus Kabocha and long beans Bone Marrow with crostini Pork BBQ Skewer (last item served-think they forgot) Bibingka Souffle  Coconut Halo Halo  The sisig taco was just ok. I didn't like the strong lemon or sour flavor. Also, I've had some good sisig tacos in North and South Cali and Cutting Board didn't match up to it. In addition, the taco was falling apart. There's too much sauce that it broke the wrap into pieces.   The bone marrow and crispy pata were my favorites and the best I've ever had.  All the other dishes were good but nothing that stood out for me.   The bibingka souffle was delicious and so was the halo halo. I did wish the halo halo had some ice in there but it didn't.    Overall, a pretty good size restaurant.  My friends who are locals here says that there's live music.  I would love to return and try other dishes and hope to get a better experience.",

    "text": "Long story short- this place is acceptable if you've never had any Filipino family members or friends cook for you, in which case I am so, so sorry.     Came here for breakfast; spent upwards of $50 as follows: -Bangsilog with garlic rice  -Longsilog with garlic rice  -Lumpianitas  -Coffee -Thai iced tea   The only solid item was the lumpianitas, however it's difficult to fumble lumpia.  It tasted like straightforward lumpia you'd get from Seafood City.    The bangsilog and had so much potential to be great, but was ultimately disappointing.  While perfectly cooked, the fish itself seemed to have zero seasoning.  The only way I was able to get through the plate was a heavy handed dousing of vinegar and soy sauce.    The longsilog wasn't much better.  It was a safer option, considering the meat was probably purchased through a reputable third party distributor, however the meat itself was under-rendered and fatty.    The garlic rice broke my heart to pieces.  We paid extra just for it to more closely resemble steamed rice than anything else.  I understand that it's more time efficient to prepare garlic rice in a rice cooker, however a little fresh garlic, some oil, and a hot pan would be vastly more superior and justify the additional expense.    The Thai iced tea was lackluster with no discernible flavor profiles and the coffee was just that.  Coffee.    Lastly, the service was friendly but a bit strange.  There was an older white gentleman who seemed to be lost and smelled so strongly of cigarettes that I nearly lost my appetite before ordering.  Our main server Michael, however, was friendly, attentive and accommodating.    Not entirely sure if I'll be back.  It was only breakfast, but if you can't execute breakfast correctly it leaves me little faith in your ability to serve an adequate lunch/dinner.",

    "text": "Someone told us about the Cutting Board we are so w tied to try it cuz all the pictures on yelp looks so good. I was so excited that I ordered so much food for only 3 people. So here's my review..... Dessert: I'm a big halo halo fan that I always order my halo halo before the meal comes. I've seen the picture of the Coconut Halo that made me so excited to try it, I was a little bit disappointed as it was not anything close to a Filipino Halo Halo. I do realized this restaurant is a fusion but I wish it was more of the original but with a twist of being in a coconut shell then you have a coconut meat as a bonus. Same as the Ube and bibingka Souffle that did not have and flavor of an Ube or bibingka, the texture was not even close to a Souffle.  Entree: bone marrow was delicious, have to order! Bangus sisig has a really good flavor, really recommend ordering; Kare Kare was good but I would have preferred it to have a little bit of the peanut taste...not bad; forgot what they called this dish but it had green beans and kalabasa which was amazingly good. I can truly have the whole order to myself....really need to order it!; oxtail soup was good and had a lot of ingredients to it; crispy pata is one of my favorite Filipino dish CB's CP was just ok, I really don't care for the sauce that came with it I think it needs a little something and the meat really did not have any flavor and part of the skin was not crispy which is disappointing to me. Paella is not the authentic Paella, did not have any saffron to it which was more ketchup taste to me. Overall experience was just OK.",

Our waiter was really nice but it almost seemed like they didn't want to come back and check up on anyone. I ordered the Lechon and my girlfriend ordered the Pancit. The lechon tasted almost identical to carnitas and the paella tasted like mexican rice. Now for $20 I could have gotten a lot more at Cardenas or La bonita. I was quite disappointed, be prepared because its very fatty. The pancit my girlfriend did not like. It tasted like chinese food. Again pretty disappointed I wish it was a bit cheaper or the food quality went up",

The parking lot looks abandoned, complete with weeds everywhere. The service was very slow. They only took one check at a time and THAT seemed daunting to them.

    "text": "I am so glad I found this place.  There aren't a lot of good Filipino restaurants back at home and I visit Vegas often. So now I have a great Filipino restaurant that I can call home. My mom doesn't cook a lot anymore because no one lives at home. I miss her cooking so much.   First off, I love the atmosphere. It's spacious and modern. At home, Filipino restaurants are owned by older Filipinos with old decorations and it smells funny. At the Cutting Board, they have simple and artistic decoration. (I forgot to take a picture of the mechanical heart that was sitting behind us). They have a nice big readable sign of their restaurant. They played music that was hip, catchy, bumpin' (only because we were literally sitted next to the speaker) and more for the young crowd. But it was not too obnoxious because I was still able to hear the people beside me. It was enjoyable music.   Second, the employees were nice like all Filipinos are. And the waiter recommended something for us to eat which was nice.   Thirdly, the food was just like home. The chicken adobo was different from the way Filipino mom's or my husband makes it. It was saucier and sweeter than a typical chicken adobo. My husband said the chicken was tender, so it was delicious. The embutido was cold when we got it. :/ My favorite of course, was the Lechon Kawali. It was delicious, but I would have like it to be a bit crunchier.  The lumpia was perfect. The paella Valencia was great. The shrimp was the perfect Filipino size (none of that tiny shrimp!). A bowl of rice for 3 people (2 white and 1 filipina) was enough for us. But it was all Filipino? We might have needed more rice. Hehehe ;)   Finally, the desserts were sweet and was the cherry on top of the delicious experience. The coconut halo-halo was amazing. It was cool that it was in a coconut, but a lot of work to get the meat off the coconut. It would be even more delicious if it had more toppings that a typical halo-halo included. The coconut halo halo was an interesting concept of halo halo.  My husband got the bibingka souffle. I didn't think it tasted like bibingka at all. It was tremendously egg-y. Yes, I know bibingka has eggs in it and the souffle also had egg in it. So just to me, it was too much egg flavor. To top off the egg flavor it had a slice from the purple egg (I forgot what it was called) and some kind of cheesy crumble.   It was a bit pricey for three people. And it was really a family style portion. But we did get a lot of food in the first place. So that's totally on us. Now we know what it's like and can't wait to come back again.",

    "text": "From our hotel we really drove to go this place out of curiousity since it has 4 star and more than 500 reviews. I barely see a filipino restaurant that has 4 star and so many nice reviews thats why me and my husband decided to come to this place.  Right from the entrance you feel welcomed already. Althou I know filipinos are top hospitable thats is given but this place really give you nice service and you barely see that on las vegas. What we ordered is mostly the food we keep seeing popping out on their yelp. As per my husband who love trying filipino food around las vegas, for us this is really good. The lechon kawali is not oily as like other restaurant serve it. The sisig pork is good but I prefer mine with chicharon or something crunchy but we love it too because it was tasty there is little kick on spicyness at the end. The place for me is really nice, like a asian fusian style. And I barely see a filipino store that was well presented like this. Background music ohhhh perfect we loved it. We had one server and he serve like high class style he does know how to take care of his customers. Went here 11am, Dec. 9, 2018 it was not busy that time so we kinda enjoy our food and chill a little bit with our ube ice cream who my little one love it so much. The dessert hmmm... the coconut flan is good not too sweet just right... I was planning to try their halo halo and more but I got too full already if ever we go back to las vegas will defintely go back here.  Parking is big so nothing to worry its close to the freeway too so very accessible.  Park",

    "text": "This is one of the only higher-end Filipino restaurants in Vegas. As you walk in, it is a huge, open room. The kitchen, pay register, and dining areas are all very visible from each other, but are separated by a good amount of space. The interior design of Cutting Board is more casual, but the food is good quality and presented in innovative, fashionable ways. If you are a Filipino(a) who is more comfortable with Tagalog, your waiter will speak with you in Tagalog. My waiter was very respectful, accommodating, and attentive to our needs. He checked on us at least once every 10 minutes and explained how to eat my dessert!  I ordered pinakbet, crispy pata, garlic fried rice, and bibingka souffle. Pinakbet is a vegetable and pork (sometimes shrimp added) dish whose main flavor base is bagoong, aka concentrated shrimp paste. Crispy pata is deep fried pork knuckles. Bibingka is a sweet rice flour dessert baked in banana leaves and has some salted egg on top.  The pinakbet contained chunks of deep fried pork belly with crunchy skin and minimal fat. The bitterness of the bittermelon was toned down a lot! Idk how they did it, but I only sensed like 10% of bitterness. The eggplant and squash were soft while the green beans were slightly crisp. The sauce didn't have too much shrimp paste (bagoong), so I think this would be a good place to try your first pinakbet, especially if you are sensitive to fishy flavor. Oyster sauce and some sugar were other novel elements I tasted in Cutting Board's pinakbet.  The crispy pata was HUGE and worth the $19. If you do not like eating fatty food, you should not order this. The skin was crispy like a packaged pork rind, but denser and crunchier like a thickly sliced potato chip. However, some of the meat had an aftertaste that I did not enjoy, so I did not eat too much. There is liver sauce and vinegar to dip your crispy pata into, which is what I did to cover up the aftertaste of the meat.  The garlic fried rice was one of my favorites! I couldn't see much garlic in the actual rice, but maybe the cooks finely minced it! This complimented the main dishes better than plain white rice would.   Dessert for last~ the bibingka souffle was a very interesting take on traditional bibingka. I would describe it as half creme brulee half bibingka. The souffle is served in a ceramic bowl on top of a wooden cutting board. In the board contains a banana leaf for decor, 1/4 a salted egg, dry cheese curds, and a small container of condensed sweet milk. You are supposed to break a hole in the souffle and put the egg, cheese, and milk inside. It is recommended that you mix these together, which is what I did. Eventually, this became a frothy, soupy dessert of sweetness with hints of salty contrast from the salted egg and cheese.   Overall, the casual tone and friendly waiters make Cutting Board a welcoming environment. The dishes have different takes that make the flavors unique but still Filipino in a unique sense. Go try this place out!",

Gave great recommendations, was funny, checked on us frequently, and even offered to change the music for us!   Pork sisig- unbelievably flavorful, perfect amount of salty, savory, and spicy. Reminded me of the sisig they made for my Lola's birthday in the Philippines years ago - but BETTER!   Tamarind Baby Back Ribs - Sweet, tangy, and tender. I was so impressed that someone thought of combining those flavors and executing it so perfectly   CB Fried Rice - get it. If you like fried rice with carrots, peas, shrimp, chicken, and Chinese sausage, this should definitely be up your alley.   Bibinka souffle - the best dessert I have ever eaten at restaurant, ever.   Drinks: Island Palms, Calamantini, CB Colada, and an AMF (secret menu). They were all delicious, You could tell someone cared about how their drinks tasted, but the CB Colada was my favorite.   We came an hour and a half before closing, and by then most places are trying to rush you out, don't take the time to make jokes with you, or take as much care of you as they did. I absolutely love coming to local restaurants that take pride in everything that comes out of their kitchen, and even more when there's a modern twist on my favorite cultural foods.   I can't recommend this place enough. I love the ambiance, the service, the food, and the drinks. Please keep doing everything you are doing! 12 out of 5 stars",

Their dining area is huge, great food, and pretty good amount of alcohol/beer (if you're into that).   They have a pretty wide variety of Filipino dishes on their menu, & their portion sizes are pretty decent as well! They can be on the \"pricey\" side depending on what you get and how many people you're about to feed, but I'm TELLING YOU it is WORTH it! Service CAN be touch & go. I've been here a decent amount of time to tell you that sometimes they have amazing service & other times they don't -- & mind you, this is when they aren't busy.   I honestly would recommend trying their bone marrow (sluuurp! So good!), lechon kawali, crispy pata, bangus sisig (husband's favorite), & their ube souffle!",

I've been to several filipino restaurants in Vegas, and this place has the best pork sisig! It beats the Cafe Moda ones which used to be our favorite sisig place. The lechon kawali is melt in your mouth goodness, the meat was soft and the skin was crispy. I didn't like the sauce or gravy that came with the lechon kawali though, I wish it was the traditional Mang Tomas sarsa. I ended up eating my lechon kawali with no sauce on it. The bibingka souffle is just so so, it's good but not great. Not something I'd be craving for, and I find it too expensive for $8. I'll be trying the coconut halo halo next time! The reason for the 4 stars is because of the size of the serving, the portion is on the smaller side. Because compared to other filipino restaurants I've been to, the serving was much more compared to this place and you pay the same price. Or if the serving cannot be much more, at least lower down the price. Nevertheless, I will still come back to this place!",

It's almost like you were all sitting at one large table so you can barely hear the person talking next to you or across from you. At the same time, there is no privacy since everyone else around you can hear everything that you're talking about.   It is definitely not a setting that you want to take a significant other to. If you want to have a large group of your buddies and have a drink this might be your place. But overall I did not like the set up of the establishment and because of this will most likely not be back",

    "text": "Finally a Filipino restaurant that we can be proud of. Service was excellent (the owner brought some of our orders himself) ambiance was cozy and the foods are to die for. We ordered the bone marrow tapa which is a must try, the Kare- Kare is by far the best I've tasted bec of the bagoong sauce. The bangus sisig was also delicious (don't forget to eat the crispy part), and the tamarind baby back ribs was also good but my least favorite. We also ordered the pancit Bahmi w/c I also liked. For dessert, the  bibingka souffle was truly one of a kind. So delicious that I had to scrape the ramekin. Too bad they ran out of the halo-halo so we were not able to try it today. I can't wait to come back to try the other entrees in the menu.",

Ended up sharing a table with another couple.   She was from the Philippines and also there for the first time on House Seat tickets.  We were ALL disappointed with the food!  The band played short sets with frequent breaks.  A DJ took over when they were on break.  The band was good but we didn't care for the DJ.  The concrete floors in the restaurant amplified the volume of the entertainment to the point that our ears hurt.   While the servers and manager were attentive, I know 4 people who will not visit this restaurant again.",

I will give you a tip and check in for the Ube pancake no matter what time it is.  You must try the bone marrow once here.  We also like the calamari, green beans and kubocha, oxtail sinigang, pancit mami. and lechon kawali. The table next to us got the kamayan where everyone shares a mix of yumminess: crispy pata, rice, vegatbles, etc. Also get a dessert...worth it even if you are so full!

Decided to try the bone marrow, and it did not disappoint at all. Flavor was all there, would definitely get this again. We also got the sisig, very good.  Some places don't make sisig crunchy, this was on point and also very flavorful. Last was the binagoongan, hubby liked it but was too sweet for my taste. The food presentation was perfect. I love the cutting board platters some of the dishes and appetizers came out on. FYI, All dishes are table portions, our group ordered way too much food, but now we know for next time   Would definitely come again to try other dishes!",

Be aware most offerings are \"small plates\". The larger portions are family-style-esque for 2 or more people. My choice was a small plate of Crispy Garlic Shrimp which was was about 7 pieces and less than garlicky. I had to order a bowl of Garlic Rice which was very good. I did enjoy the selection of beers on tap, especially San Miguel, which you don't normally find on tap. I may return.",

Server was prompt in bringing us the happy hour menu.  The happy hour had quite a variety of items at reasonably discounted prices. (Of course I had to order the lumpia, lol). The regular menu also had the bulk of what we Filipinos love, items like: pork sisig, kare kare, different options of silogs, pancit, arroz caldo, and even desserts like turon.  I ordered garlic noodles off the happy hour menu. Very, VERY salty in my opinion. But maybe I'm just sensitive to sodium. I knew deep down I should have asked to adjust the seasoning level before ordering, but I wanted to give the regular garlic noodles a try. Nothing amazing.  The lumpia -- fresh, hot, and crispy. No complaints here.  My boyfriend devoured his order of kare kare. But the restaurant charges for side of rice (steamed or garlic), which I think entrees should already come with a side of rice, but hey, that's just me.   Our friends ordered the bone marrow, chicken sisig tacos, bangus silog, fish balls, and some mango juice.  Ambiance was nice. Kinda hipster-ish but cute. Very good for large parties (PS there was a large party who had their kids running around uncontrollably, being very loud when we got here, lol). But otherwise, it was an alright experience.",

A halo halo I know consists of jackfruit, different kinds of beans, banana, sweet potato, kaong, leche flan and nata de coco.",

A gastropub is a full service tavern that just so happens to serve food that is of a higher quality than wings and nachos.  They have the food part correct, but you could hardly call this place a bar. Their drink menu consists of nothing more than bottom shelf liquor that you can get at any grocery store.  They need to remove the \"Gastropub\" from the name because this is nothing more than a restaurant that just so happens to have liquor on the menu, and Yelp needs to reclassify this as a regular restaurant.",

They serve modern versions of traditional dishes with better presentation than the family-style bowls you'd get elsewhere. Food was really good but the highlight was the garlic noodles. My kids wanted nothing to do with anything else and the hubby abandoned his meal to steal their pasta. It's a side dish but apparently can be satisfying as a meal, haha.",

Not sure if its the location, price point, or a combination of both. I liked the food I was served so it's hard to believe that being a deterrent.   Their sinigang extra sour & with extra veggies - pretty delicious. Roasted bone marrow - garlicky & will happily allow it to clog my arteries. Crispy binagoongan - just as fatty and tasty as the other items. Though the calamansi juice tasted a little on the bottled side but it was okay in general.   They have a lot to offer and I'll be a returning guest to this unique establishment. I recommend checking this place out when your in the area and love Filipino food.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here for years, but moved out of state not too long after it opened. Luckily, during a visit to my parents we decided to finally checked it out.  Let's start with the service. There was nothing to complain about because they were very friendly, but also nothing that stood out. There was a moment during our dinner where we were waiting for a little while without anyone acknowledging us, but I wasn't offended. I only saw one server running back and forth from the kitchen, so I assumed she was busy.   As for the food. We ordered the sinigang, lechon, sisig, garlic rice, lumpia, and bangus. I have to say I was blown away by the lechon. It was crispy, tender, and so perfectly cooked. My next favorite would have to be the sisig. My only gripe was that there were no crispy bits to it. Otherwise, the flavors were delicious. Garlic rice was garlic rice. I'm not usually too picky about rice as long as it isn't too soft or wet, I'm happy. It did have lots of garlic, so that was a plus. The bangus was great, but different from how I've ever had it. I've only had it served simply with a little mayo and tomatoes on the side. This one was topped with all kinds of goodness, so I can't complain. As for the lumpia, it was crispy and the filling was seasoned well. Now for the only disappointing factor of the evening. Sinigang is by far my FAVORITE Filipino dish. Whenever I come to visit I always ask my mom to make some. I can make it myself, but there's always something better when mom makes it. I love when sinigang is piping hot and as sour as can be. However, this sinigang was neither of those. We asked the server if she could go back and reheat the sinigang, but even after she did, it still wasn't much hotter. It also lacked the sourness that sinigang is known for. Growing up even my non-filipino friends would always ask me if my mom could make that \"sour soup\" whenever they'd come over. I wouldn't even describe this as that. Oh one more thing. My boyfriend ordered the calamansi cocktail and it honestly just tasted like lemonade.   All in all, I wasn't disappointed by this place. Will I recommend it to friends? Probably. I'm glad I finally got to try it out. I can't say it was amazing, but I also can't say it was bad. There were definitely some good things on the menu you should try, but I would suggest reading through peoples reviews and staying away from the ones they weren't happy about.",

At first, I was like...ok, not bad. But then after the 3rd or 4th bite, I wanted to throw up. I love sisig and I love mayo, but these 2 ingredients do not belong together! Sorry!   I did like the shanghai (with yummy sauce) and ube souffle. This place is a little overpriced for what it is. The service was fine and the place was clean. There are plenty of parking spots. Since this place is far from the strip, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. I'd rather go to the Seafood City area and get everything you need for less.",

Arrived around 2:00p, we almost had the whole place to ourselves with two other parties dining in. The restaurant is spacious but kind of oddly arranged. So much space in the front entrance area. Not sure if they have a band playing there on some nights. Anyway, we were told we could sit anywhere we want, we chose seating somewhere in the middle and we were each handed a menu. The Filipino classic section on the menu immediately caught my attention since I was hankering for some breakfast silog dish.   We placed our orders with our friendly waitress. I chose the Bansilog (milk fish w/ eggs) while hubby had the Crispy Lechon Kawali & 2 eggs (and for additional $1.75, another egg making it a total of 3)! My fish was okay but I feel like it could've been fried a little bit more. I like my bangus crispy! Otherwise, the meal with the garlic rice was scrumptious! I had a taste of the lechon kawali my hubby ordered and it was sarap (yummy)! Our lunch was so filling we didn't have room for dessert which was a bummer because I wanted to try either their Turon a la Mode or Coconut Flan. Next time we're back in Vegas we'll be sure to come back here!  Rice plates, tapas, signature, traditional and classic Filipino cuisine... makes me yearn for those delicious Filipino dishes! The place has a casual setting atmosphere and we were greeted and served with great customer service!! Looking forward to a return visit next time!   The restaurant is located about 12 miles from the Las Vegas Strip.  Review #1365 [578th business review]",

I also get great Filipino food tips from my boy Tony Milo - aka the only Filipino in Portland.   The reviews had me excited. I dropped in for a beer and some lunch while in LV for work.   First, the place was empty. Me and one other person in the entire place st 12:30. Not a good sign.   I ordered the lumpia and a pork adobo rice bowl. The lumpia was great. The highlight by far. The beer I had tasted flat. Plus, when I ordered a second despite the first being flat, the server took my first glass even though it had an inch of beer left. Huh?  Then he poured it into a small glass and refilled the pint glass. Huh?  I have never seen this before. A Filipino thing?  Tony Milo says \"no\".   The pork adobo was the real disappointment. It was almost all fat. After I trimmed the huge pieces of fat there was very little pork remaining. And what was there was flavorless. I know the dish is supposed to be tender, but not because it is made of all fat.   The garlic rice on the side was mediocre. The mango side salad was flavorless. And the random green soup tasted like curry and I'm pretty sure it was not Filipino. Again, Tony Milo agreed.   I love the concept and wish I could find good Filipino food back home, but this place will never survive unless I hit it on a very off day. Or they should just serve a lot of lumpia.",

The prices are a little higher than some other places but the portions are generous. Lechon was crispy thought the meat part a tad dry. Lumpia were flaky.  Overall, solid Filipino restaurant and one of the few Filipino offerings in this part of town.  FYI, they no longer have the free ube pancake check-in offer.",

The crew are really nice!!   I ordered garlic rice, shrimp sinigang, bangus sisig, pork adobo and Ube coconut Halo Halo.  Sinigang was good not too sour. Sisig bangus was really good for me I wish they cut the pepper more finer I was picking them out while I was eating it (that's just me) I was expecting it to be more finer than it was. Or maybe they were in a hurry, Garlic was good missing some garnish on top of it looks really plain.  Adobo was good too, my friend really liked it.  Coconut Halo-Halo was disappointing for me. It was not good at all except for the Ube ice cream on top of it. The Jello with beans was not the halo2 I was expecting.   Still willing to try the the other food they have for now.",

Their suggestions for my dinner was superb. I always like to ask what the staff would suggest, as they usually are the ones who know their menu. I enjoy trying new things and exploring new food ideas.   Atmosphere was very modern. Different options for table seating. They had a nice family style seating bar. They have TVs and music playing in the background.   We ordered the Adobo Chicken, Garlic Rice,  Tasilog Beef with eggs, Coconut Halo Halo, and the Bibingka. This food was wonderful. Prices are reasonable.   I will be back that's for sure.   Location is convenient 95/Lake Mead. Ample parking",

    "text": "Dined here with my family--8 people including a baby--on a Monday night and we were quite surprised to see that it was deserted. My brother expressed some hesitation upon seeing the lack of customers, but they trusted my research so in we went :)  One of the things I love the most about my family is that we eat like there's no tomorrow. So buckle up (or in our case, let it loose)..  We had: - Lumpianitas: Mini and perfectly crispy. It's really hard to mess up lumpia. Cute presentation--served in mini fryer baskets along w/ sweet chili sauce.   - Pancit bami: I detest dry pancit. Theirs was quite wet, and the noodles were pretty soft. If you like your noodles a bit more on the firm side, don't My nephew, who loves his lola's version, ate it all up. It was good.   - Kare kare: Came in this cute little palayok w/ grilled zucchini and shrimp paste on the side. The oxtail was tender, the sauce creamy and the green beans could've been cooked just a smidge longer (too tender for me).   - Seafood Sinigang - They used kale and not the typical leafy greens for this dish (like bok choy or long beans). The broth had the perfect sourness from the tamarind, which makes sinigang addicting. I thought they could've added more seafood. The veggies were a bit too undercooked for me, but again, just a personal preference.   - Crab fried rice: This was a hit for the entire table. They used a decent amount of real crab meat and the umami was on a whole another level!  - CB house fried rice - This was good, but nothing too memorable. It had shrimp, sausage and I don't remember what else.  - Sisig - Served on a sizzling plate, which always adds to the authenticity and came with all the accoutrements like egg (it was cracked on the plate and cooked by the time it came to us) + lemon wedges. They used only pork belly (it's traditionally nose-to-tail i.e. pig ears, snout, cheeks, liver, belly etc. ). I like my sisig crunchy, and theirs didn't quite cut it, but it was still delicious, and plus, I appreciate that it didn't contain any liver because I'm not tooo fond of it.   - Green beans and squash: Ordering this was a silly attempt at making ourselves feel a little better about devouring such fatty and protein-rich dishes. I thought the squash and green beans were undercooked. When my mom cooks squash (like let's say in pinakbet), it's melt-in-your-mouth. I like it that way. It's perfect to eat with rice when it's mushy. Anyway, it's safe to say, this was the least popular dish at the table.   - Pork adobo: Could've used a bit more tenderizing. If you're a seasoned adobo eater, you know there's a million variations of adobo. I prefer it to be on the darker side and swimming in thick sauce. This was it. The ratio of lean to fatty meat was great (you NEED some fat to amp up the flavor!!). Good, but it's adobo, and I never really order adobo when I dine out because, well, I've had my fair share of it and I'd rather order other dishes that are more exciting like Bicol Express or Binagoongan. SUE ME.   - Beef Caldereta - Meat was quite chewy and my SIL thought it should've had potatoes. It was just beef and carrots, which was fine, but potatoes would've really complemented the beef and the sauce.   - Bibingka souffle* - Looked like a souffle on the outside but the inside wasn't fluffy at all and it just fell apart. It was like eating the whites of a sunny-side up egg. It came w/ a teeny portion of salted egg that sometimes go on/in bibingka but it was just poorly executed.   - Ube souffle* - Better than the bibingka but wasn't exceptional. Light and had the right amount of ube flavor but it was grainy. I literally tasted and felt the granulated sugar on my tongue. It came with a mini ube piece.   *Both souffles came with their own sauces. You're supposed to make a hole in the center of the souffle to pour the sauce in.    - Coconut flan: Never got to taste this, but my SIL loved it (she's Mexican and have had both Mexican-style and Filipino-style flan).  - Chocolate lava cake with butter pecan: Our server gave this to us gratis because he overheard us talking about upcoming bdays in the family. Super sweet!  - Calamansi juice - My dining mates ordered it, some enjoyed it but the others thought it was too sweet.   Service was prompt. We were hoping to order some food to-go for the moms, but weren't warned that the kitchen was closing. Would've been nice to get a heads up especially because we ordered so much food and still had dessert coming.   Did they deliver on flavor and authenticity? For the most part, yes. Presentation? Yup, I love that they utilized nontraditional plateware like mini cutting boards. Service? It was good. Ambiance? The place was huge, and although it felt a bit weird to be the only ones there, it made for quite an intimate setting. Price? Pretty steep for some dishes--I mean oxtail kare kare for $20??...  There were hits and misses, but overall we all left feeling happy and extremely satisfied.",

We decided to try Cutting Board out and it was great! The service was great and friendly and the food amazing!   We ordered pancit, sisig, and calamari. Everything had great flavor and hit the spot to satisfy our craving. Although the food was amazing, let me tell you, dessert blew me away! It was the friend suman and it was topped with toasted coconut and a mango syrup. The perfect ending to a meal.   I'll definitely be back. I would say that for Filipinos this will remind you of home and for anyone else, it's just amazing food to try!",

    "text": "Fan---tas---tic!!!  This was a great find, and thank you Yelp for pointing me in this direction!  Full disclosure: I am not Filipino, nor am I extremely familiar with the cuisine.  I did have some guidance by friends, but there were too many options I wanted to try, so I really want to go back to dive into the rest of the menu.  Maybe I should bring a group with me so we can try everything.  Anyway, I started with the Citrus & Spice cocktail.  It is billed as having some heat to it, which is quite True.  But, even my weak palette wasn't overwhelmed.  It has the perfect amount of sweet, citrus, and spice.  Perfectly balanced, perfectly made.  For starters, man, hard decision... but the Lumpianitas beckoned.  Lumpia in mini-egg roll form (for lack of a better description).  Man... there were a lot in that basket, but I could have kept eating them.  Very addictive!  The sauce was a fairly standard sweet chili affair... not sure how authentic it is... but it was a great complement to the nuggets.  Really tasty and very shareable!  My entree was breakfast, which I hear is big in Filipino cuisine.  I had the lechon kawali (fried pork) with eggs, and it was delicious.  There was ample food, so plenty to eat for about $11.  And it was all great!  Do yourself a favor, pay the extra buck and upgrade to the garlic rice.  I'm not going to say it was better than the eggs, pork, or mango slaw, but it was an amazing side!  I can't imagine not getting it in the future.  The vinegar and gravy were both slightly sweet, and neither overwhelmed the dish, so give them both a try.  Quite tasty overall.  I would come back here in a heartbeat.  This was a great find in the Summerlin area.  If I find myself in this neck of the woods again, I will be back here to try different tasty treats!",

I believe they add a bit of sugar to get the sauce to taste so wonderful. The crispy pork sisig was slightly over cooked. The oxtail kare kare was AMAZING! Be aware that this dish has a very potent Pb taste. The stew was mouthwatering and so tasty! The pancit bami was ok. I'm a little picky about my pancit...  Overall, I suggest visiting this restaurant as you will be far from disappointed. I plan on visiting again and trying more of the menu.",

    "text": "I've been to Cutting Board about 6 times and 5 out of the 6 times the service and food have been good. So why 2 stars? Well, principle far outways physical and the one time my husband and I came back for lunch excited to have the beef tapa silog and they brought it out with half meat and half gristle. I know some flips may say, well what is so wrong with fat? Gross!! Who wants to chew on lard bubbles? Not I! I was very disappointed, because the first time I ordered this meal for lunch it was actually quite delectable. It was mostly meat, and had a tender middle while it had crunchy edges which is what tapa is standardly supposed to be. This was blah, and I suspect that not a minite or drop of marinating was involved. It was pale in color and clearly something a cheap Frankenstein would create and with huge balls would manifest, as a meal stitched up with marbles of fat!!! On top of all of that, we politely with tact disclosed the issue to the owner and she smiled and said \"I will definitely let them know.\" She did not hear a complaint or sense any urgency. We were not sympathized with nor apologized to, nor compensated in any way shape or form, but with a mere statement of corrections to be made in the future. Why bother? Thanks, but no thanks. My gag reflex may not be able to withstand a second try....my husband is done with this place. I may give it another go, but not with that same dish and now I am skeptical.",

But ended up of going here to try what they have and I can say that everything was so good!!!  we ordered kare kare, chicken inasal, bangus sisig, java rice and garlic fries, and it was so good!!! although serving is a little small and the sizzling bangus was not sizzling when they serve it to us, the plating,  presentation, ambience was so good, good for kids also and our server Nicole was excellent even she knows that we are filipino and know what is in the menu she took time to explain everything!!!!  and we noticed that the owner and manager are there to help as well!!! The dessert bibingka souffle is so delicious and must try!!!!! You just have to order it in advance since it will take at least 20 mins. To tap it all our experience was excellent!!! Hope they maintain everything as it is!!! And hope the band will start soon!!!!",

Our server was very friendly and enthusiastic about the food. We were a party of 9, so we ordered plenty of food. I highly recommend the adobo fried rice. It comes with plantains which was unexpected, but tasty nonetheless. We also ordered sisig tofu, crispy pata, beef tadyang, and kare kare. Everything we tried was pretty good. As other people have said, it's sort of a modern twist to your traditional filipino dishes. Overall, the food was delicious, but felt very heavy, even with the amount of people that we had. I didn't order any drinks, but from what I saw it seems like they have a good selection of beers. I'd recommend this place for anyone looking to try something new!",

So he finally got the chance to stop by and have dinner here, and I was invited. As soon as we walked in, we were already impressed by the ambience and the courtesy of the staff, Tiffany, welcoming us. We were immediately sat and asked what we wanted to drink, by our server, Nadine. She offered some specials with what's at the bar & tap and certain street food specials. So we were tempted to order some shrimpballs & fishballs, along with our cocktails. Those Calamantinis were so refreshing & delicious! So we're those shrimpballs & fishballs, that totally reminded me of my childhood & the street foods in Manila. One thing I was so skeptic about were those pickled ampalaya, (bittermelon), that was served with the seafood balls. They were tossed with some onions, garlic & ginger. I tried it & I was highly impressed, in how it took the bitterness away, from how they prepared it! Little things like that alone makes such an impact to me. Clearly they know techniques in how to prepare certain foods, that has an acquired taste, and make it better. We also ordered the Tamarind Honey Babyback Ribs & the Pork Sisig, that were both phenomenal!!! There were very little leftover for me to take home. Even that was great the next day!!! Upon enjoying our meal, we were then approached by Jenny & Barry, who were such incredible people, of course along with Tiffany & Nadine, who were always checking up on us, and pretty much every one of their guests. I love talking to people, especially when it comes to their passion of food and great service. I can't say anymore about how wonderful our experience were. We'll definitely be back, to try the rest of that extensive menu, with such inventive fusions, & see that brilliant staff once again! I can't wait! See you all very soon! Cheers!",

We were forgotten. 25 minutes later, we called the attention of the owner or manager. Told him no one had taken our orders yet. He started looking around who was available but he ended up taking our orders. After that, we noticed everyone got their orders, even the ones who came after us. Seemed to us that they forgot our orders. The server said they were just busy. Our first order came at 1:20. But it took almost 2 hours from the time we got there to the time they served our last order. We were so hungry we started eating even if we were missing 2 of our orders. We were so disappointed. I remember I was there with my friends from LA back in August and we were also dissatisfied with the service and the food quality. My friend ordered the lechon roll which was obviously a little stale. Will I recommend this place? Maybe. But with a warning that service is super slow.",

Our server came to the table with three glasses of 80% filled with water and then took another 10 minutes to get our other three waters! I cannot believe it. Aside from the DISASTROUS service the food is quality! We ordered the dulong and choriburger meatballs, the dulong was waaay better, it's not too fishy and I loved the garlic baguette. The bangus sisig is something you need to order! It's totally worth it and I love it! Though everything else we order was decent those three pieces were the best ones.

We also had a delicious cocktail I can't quite remember the name of and the halo halo dessert, which is a coconut filled with all kinds of delicious stuff and topped with ice cream. As we were paying and getting ready to leave we got the chance to meet Tiffany the owner and the nice woman who works the menu. Everyone there was great and the food was awesome.

The amount of food was more than enough for us, which is nice, cause often times you get places that give you such a small portion of food to share between a lot of people.  Everything was cooked to perfection and was so on par and delicious.  The service was amazing.  I really couldn't ask for more in a Filipino Restaurant!",

All the dishes available styled in a modern way, meaning that the way they are presented is impressive. It feels very much like a hipster take on traditional food. Some of the entrees aren't entirely traditional. For example, their Pancit uses two different style of noodles. It was decent. The Lechon Kawali was my absolute favorite! Do yourself a favor and try it! The Sinigang was not the best I have ever tasted, it was good but I'd rather make it at home. The Lumpianitas weren't to die for but absolutely satisfy the craving and were delicious. I will get them again. I wouldn't get the crab fried rice or mac and cheese again. The crab fried rice didn't have a very bold flavor at all and the mac and cheese can just as easily be found at any bar. Again, both of these items were good but not special. They were sold out of Halo Halo which was nearly devastating. We didn't get any complimentary plantains - which I thought came as a starter like bread would come at an Italian Restaurant. I think if it WAS supposed to be a started that would kick this place up even a notch more, but I was probably mistaken.  The waitress was nice, the owner kept checking up on us, and the atmosphere was sleek and interesting. They have only been open for a few weeks I am sure they are still working out some kinks.  I will absolutely be back for more! I am excited about this place.",

Service and foods are both perfect.Their Crispy Pata is perfectly cooked that is really soft inside and crispy outside...Just let the server know when they take your order that you'll be having a bibingka souffle if you have a plan to take it as a dessert cause it takes about 20 mins to make which is understandable. Chicken Inasal with Java Rice has perfect taste where the Java Rice has a kick of mango taste which give the food a good flavor on it... I also love the salads that comes with the food it make things perfect... The only thing that is kinda bad is the sisig tacos, it's just I am expecting for soft tacos but they serve it with hard tacos, well that is their concept that people has to respect lol but still good flavors on it... All in all is I love this place it's just too far from my place cause I live in the south but still I will recommend and still go back to this place...

Friday after Thanksgiving  and had a hankering for Filipino food.  All Filipino restaurants were closed in my vicinity except for this, let's give it another shot. It seems livelier with a DJ at the corner, supposedly spinning music. There was no person up front but 2 servers (?) were by the bar chatting. I could see someone at a corner, counting his tips (?). After about 5 minutes or so, someone comes up to the counter to greet me. He did say he would come back to get my order. Another guest comes in and I'm assuming the front person (as I have seen her before at the reception area) is handling her personal business ignores him for a good minute before she turns and asks him if he needs to be seated.  He says he's here to pick up an order. She says she'll find someone to help him and it takes about 5 - 10 before he finally gets to pick up his order. The server turns to me to get my order (while not done with the other guy). I order the bangus sisig, no tomatoes, side order of mango salsa (not on menu - totally willing to pay extra for this), and garlic fried rice. He indicated he would check if he can accommodate the mango salsa, confirmed my order. I asked how long and he said in 20 - 25 minutes. I sat down,  started my review. It came in about 20 minutes, paid my bill and went on my merry way. When I got home, surprise, surprise! *SIGH* There were tomatoes in my order. The food was okay, I think, will try again in 5 months.",

To make it short, it's a place I won't visit again. I've spent $260 for 10 ppl  which could be far less if we went to a Thai restaurant that I know my folks will really enjoy.   In summary, this is familiar with most Filipino restaurants, they start good but can't keep up their service up to par with others.  I feel sad because I want them to do good but...,",

    "text": "Came in on a Wednesday night with my friend. We were greeted by the hostess immediately and was seated right away. We ordered pork sisig tacos, chicken inasal, crispy pata, side of white rice and the bibingka souffle. The sisig tacos weren't as good as I was expecting. The pork was stale and even the flavors wasn't the best. The chicken inasal was ok. But I guess it was more of a single person order because it came with one cup of java rice. The crispy pata came and it was honestly the best dish that we ordered for the night and possibly the best I've had in Las Vegas. It was fall off the bone and the skin was fried to perfection. The only thing was the sauces it came with the black sauce wasnt super tasty but the house made gravy that came with was really good! You can tell they used some of the stock where they slowly cooked the Crispy Pata. Then came the bibingka souffle i guess i expected too much. If you've ever had the traditional bibingka from the Philippines this doesnt compare. The only thing that made it taste a little bit like bibingka was the small slice of salted egg that it came with. Over all it was an ok restaurant if you are in the mood for an upscale filipino food restaurant.",

Just to name a few, I personally love the pork/ bangus sisig, bone marrow and adobo rice. The bibingka souffle is a plus! (highly recommended). Very good Filipino cuisine with a modern twist. Not to mention, the staff were so friendly and accommodating especially our server Jill and Rio! Great job guys! Will definitely go back and recommend this Filipino resto to all my friends.",

Doesn't even come close. I see that they're trying to do a Filipino fusion twist and the atmosphere is more vibrant and modern but even the customer service was not the best; super slow and our waiter looked like he just wasn't having it. We ordered the pork sisig tacos and seafood paella. The shrimp was juicy and the rice had some flavor. Pork sisig tacos had the most flavor. The lechon kawali wasn't salty enough to be honest lol some of the group waited for their food way too long and it was only a mango salad. on top of that, at the very end when our receipt was given, our waiter didn't bother giving us our $5 change when he was given an automatic 18% gratuity already. Super rude if U ask me. Surprisingly there was a lot of customers around dinner time. I would rather eat fiesta Filipina for the real Filipino food or just eat my mom's cooking. Lol oh AND it was hella far.",

Food keep coming for the adult table, in the meantime no food for our kids, we keep asling for our food and they keep saying its coming, its coming. Short staff the manager said. Ok, understood, but the other group of people who came later than us already got their food as well. In the meantime our kids havent eaten yet and we were done. I guess they have forgotten to put it that order and so it cane so late. Kare kare came so late that we thought we forgot to order it. Mind you the kids order was just fried chicken. Kids table didnt have any utensils, plates, we had to ask for water. We had to get up and get our own serving spoons for the food they were serving us. We finally got a pitcher if water to refill our cups.  Manager came to apologize and kinda argued with her swrver which was unprofessional. We asked for compensation for our wait. None given. She came back trying to explain why the service was slow, short staff, u know how business is...Asked us if we would come again..hmmm.at what point did we get good service that we should come back. How should we say the service was to our friends and co workers. Even if the food was good we will never go back or recommend this place to our friends. Theres a lot of filipino restaurants here in Vegas, noting out of the ordinary here.",

    "text": "The cutting board is a great place to eat with a very cool interior. Kind of like chipotles. It's great for family, friends, and couples. The floor space is spacious so you're not table to table with your neighbors. While I was there music was playing in the back ground and it created a warm atmosphere.   There were about three servers running tables for about 9 tables so we were always being help! A+   Now let's get into the food! The first thing that we ordered was the calamari I was hesitant so I had asked if the calamari was going to be heavily seasoned- our waitress told me they can adjust it if need be! I told them it's fine and trusted the cooks. When it came out- PERFECTION!!! Barley any oil, lightly coated, and balanced seasoning. You must try the calamari!   As for entrees we ordered garlic fried rice, pork sisig, and pancit bami. Garlic fried rice wasn't too heavy on the garlic but just enough for flavor. I enjoyed the sisig as well, I can't give you a comparison to others because I haven't eaten sisig that much not know the difference. The pancit was good too- the noodles were thick and I liked that a lot!  Overall everything blended well together.  Drinks- we got a Thai tea and a calamansi mojito. That was something new that I've never seen before but wanted to try it so bad because I love calamansi juice! The mojito came out really well. A little bit light on the mint but it enhanced the calamansi taste! Thanks!!! They also had a lychee mojito which I will try next time.  The only thing I'm knocking a star off for is was the fact that it was really hot inside. I'm not sure if the ac was down what but it was kind of uncomfortable at the end of our meal after we ate really hot food. The servers were amazing and very prompt. Thanks so much- we will be back for sure.",

They didn't even know about my order when I called them after an hour (my money was taken out of my account right away though.) When I called, the guy who answered said he just got there but would take care of it right away. No apology. When I picked it up, the guy who gave it to me also didn't apologize and was quick to say he didn't do it when I told him they didn't even know about my order. This is what bothers me most is when people can't apologize even if they're not directly responsible. At least apologize for the restaurant. For this reason, I won't be returning. The food was just OK. I've definitely had better Filipino food and can make much better looking lumpia, so l won't be missing much.",

I haven't seen too many Filipino Asian fusion places around Vegas, so we were all pretty excited to try this place. It's fairly modern inside, which was a nice change of pace from the traditional places around the city. They have a mix of classics dishes and modern takes on old favorites (i.e. chicken adobo, and lechon ramen); all of which were delicious. This is also part gastropub, which is unique, and while I have not tried any of their selection of wines/beers, I will try to during future visits.

They have your traditional Filipino dishes like Lola (Grandma) used to make. Amazing flavor that ignites your tastebuds into a blissful nirvana. They perfect the very foundation of Filipino cuisine. But what they do exceptionally is create dishes uniquely them. My personal favorite has to be the Bangus Sisig. It's is the perfect level of acidity mixed with the savoriness of the bangus. This dish will blow your mind and leave you in a trace of pure joy. Make sure you leave room for desert, because their Ube Souffle is the best way to eat Ube. It's light, fluffy, and flavorful. You won't go wrong ordering anything off the menu here. So get on down there and enjoy Las Vegas' hidden gem!",

We came here for my mom's birthday party and they were SUPER accommodating to our large party. The service was great and the portions were huge. The fish sisig was something I never had before and I loved that too. Also the lechon tasted good, it wasn't rubbery or chewy like the lechon I've tried from like seafood city or at a filipino party. Its the perfect place to bring family from out of town here because it is BOUJEE. Prices are reasonable too.",

    "text": "Ay nako, this place. Not even a gastropub! It's a faux-fancy Filipino place trying too hard. So I met up with my family here one Sunday for a late lunch. It wasn't really busy, but it still took them 15 minutes to seat us. They had clean tables. I didn't have a large party with me. So starting off like that kind of left a bad taste in my mouth.  Speaking of bad tastes, the pancit awful. Flavorless. Raw veg. Overcooked meat. Since my cousin checked in, we got a free ube pancake. It was pretty. It was purple. Didn't taste anything like ube though. We asked for a bowl of rice with our meal, which I think is BS that the dishes that need to have rice doesn't automatically come with it. They didn't even give us the rice the first time, so we had to ask again. They charged us twice for it. The rice wasn't even steaming hot. The dishes were fairly small for the prices they charge. I could have gotten a better deal with better customer service at the small Filipino places that blast TFC all day. They also never really refilled our glasses of water. Again, this place wasn't that busy at the time.  Well since I got most of the complaining out of the way, let's talk about some good stuff. They had this lengua dish that brought me back to my childhood. The serving was on the smaller side and it wasn't piping hot, but it still tasted good. My mom used to make that dish but she couldn't remember how to make it. We had the bangus sisig which wasn't bad. The adobo fried rice could have been better, but it did come with a good amount. The lechon kawali wasn't bad either. They didn't give us extra vinegar to dip it in but it was fine.   I would come back to try out other things though. So if I do come back, I'll update my review. Hopefully for the better.",

To be fair, bone marrow is my favorite at any restaurant. But Cutting Board's had a bit cheese aspect that I didn't anticipate.   The halo halo dessert is worth it! Overall a great food adventure and I can't wait to visit again when I'm in town.   Service was fast and friendly. Place was clean a wonderful experience!",

The food was delicious and the presentation on each dish and dessert was really nice. Definitely Instagram worthy! :) We had the lumpianitas, seafood paella, beef steak, bangus sisig, a side of fried plantains, and a side of garlic rice. The bangus sisig was perfect! It wasn't greasy nor soaked in mayonnaise like others we've had. For dessert, we had ube souffle and coconut flan. I'm not big on souffles, but my hubby and oldest son wanted to order it. It was good. I enjoyed it. My favorite was the coconut flan. It was delicious! Thanks to Jill, the manager, for having us try it. We enjoyed everything we had!   The customer service was superb! We came for a late lunch, around 1:45-2:00, so it wasn't the busiest time. But there were still a good amount of tables filled. Our main server ( I wish I could remember her name) was very helpful, friendly, and attentive. She checked on us often and refilled our drinks. Other servers also stopped by our table to pick up any items/plates we were finished with, to help clear some space. The manager also checked on us and made sure we were happy with our food. It was obvious they all worked together as a team, and they performed well at it.   We live about 25-30 minutes away from Cutting Board Filipino Gastropub, but we will definitely come back. Also, we love supporting Filipino restaurants in Las Vegas. Filipino food has been underrated for quite some time, but is finally becoming known to non-Filipinos. Filipino food deserves more popularity! We look forward to coming back and trying the other items on the menu, and have another excellent dining experience. We will also make sure to bring our non-Filipino friends, so they, too, can experience and taste the mouth-watering flavors of Filipino cuisine. With this restaurant's good foods, ambiance, and customer service, I'm sure they'll be fans, as well. :)",

    "text": "Cutting Board offers a modern take on Filipino Cuisine and I loved it! I only wish it were closer to Henderson or the Strip even. The gastropub  has a comfortable, hip vibe to it and is definitely large enough to host big parties.   We ordered 4 main dishes and 2 desserts for 4 people and I thought the total price was pretty decent at $60 for making us super full!   - Crispy Lechon Kawali - Loved it (although my arteries probably didn't love all the oil)! The pork belly was cooked to a crispy yet tender perfection. I really liked the slaw that it came with and only wished there was more! Yes, the dish will be oily but that's the nature of it and why not treat yourself every once in a while?   - Chicken Adobo - really flavorful and I loved the fried plantains that topped it off.   - Crispy Pork Sisig - similar to Lechon Kawali but the pork is diced, grilled, and served with a fried egg!   - Pancit - super delicious mix of different meats, veggies, and noodles! For what it's worth, my Filipino friend stated that this one of the best pancits he's had.   - Coconut Halo Halo - Halo Halo with actual, real coconut and it was a fresh mix. This was my favorite of the desserts.   - Bibingka Souffle - This pretty dish came with condensed milk for sweetness and a salted egg. The souffle itself has hints of coconut and a definite egg flavor! Very soft, warm and hearty.   I was really happy with all these dishes and highly recommend trying this place out!   -",

We waited 40 min and only 2 people got their drinks. While another table seated after us received their drinks. The show started and still no drinks. We tried to get the waiters attention and he just looked at us smiled and walked away. He didn't stop to see what we needed. We finally went to the bar to ask what was going on. We got back to the table and a lady came to apologize. Said someone called out sick and the waiter was covering his area. That doesn't excused him ignoring us or serving the table that came after. The lady then proceeded to rub my friends back while she was apologizing. And just ruined his night. My friends left.  I stayed to see if the comedy act we came to see was good. The openers were not that great. The Mic kept going out and cutting the comedians off at the punch line. The headliner was good but the mic went off several times while he was talking. Just so unorganized.  Don't think I will be going back.",

I dunno but I DO know it should not take 45 minutes to get tapsilog.  It was not even hot.  They got my husband's order wrong. The tapsilog was not so great either.  I really wanted to order dessert but I did not want to wait another hour for that! This spot would not survive in NY or LA.  For those who said it reminds them of home cooking, they must not have been talking about Filipino breakfast because it certainly was nothing to write home about. They need to increase their staff and cut down the wait time cuz I know we were not the only ones waiting almost an hour for our orders.  Maybe the lunch or dinner is better? I'll wait a while before trying again. I'll go to Chow King next time.",

Foods got flavors and nice presentation on cutting board lined with news paper looking sheet.   We ordered the bone marrow and it was huge. I think it was only for 10 bucks. Grilled bangus was yummy and refreshing from all the other meat dishes we ordered. Crispy tadyang with the gravy sauce was really good combo. The adobo with plantains was flavorful. For desserts, we got bibingka souffle and it was good with the salty egg and cheese. I hope they put more of the salty egg and cheese since the souffle was rich. Halo halo got no ice but all ube ice cream and the mix. They put it on a fresh coconut and we were able to eat the coconut meat as well.  Definitely going back. It's not cheap but worth for a quality Filipino food treat.",

I would come back here just for the desserts (souffles) , but it is really far from me so maybe on a special occasion.  The only problem was that we could order any of their specialty cocktails because they said their bartender called out sick and no one else could make the drinks.  I was really disappointment because mentioned earlier I live far from this place and wanted to try their drink, but it's okay.",

We tried:  Pork sisig kare Kare Crispy pata Clams Bone marrow Baked chicken Garlic noodles  For dessert: Bibingka souffle  Bread pudding Halo halo served in a coconut shell  All were very tasty and filling.   In my opinion, Filipinos are one of the hardest critics. Some days will be better than others... I think it's like that in anyone's kitchen. Try it out.   Will definitely make another stop over when I'm in Vegas again.",

From the garlic fried to my now my favorite Bone Marrow dish! Their lychee Mojito is out of this world and end the meal with fried jack fruit / banana and unique Halo Halo in a coconut ! You have to try to experience this Filipino fusion! It's worth the drive for sure! The bartender and our wonderful server Tin  made my first time experience lovely! Will be back for sure !",

    "text": "I happen to see this new restaurant thru Vegas Eater and was intrigued with the food pics and some Yelp comments. I had to try it myself. The restaurant location kinda sucks and believe me the place was crappy inside too before - I've been to the two restaurants before them that went belly up.  Typical buffet style Chinese and Filipino food poorly executed.    Wellll this place now has been transformed to a more refined place, modern rustic theme, no hint of Filipino inspired food from the decor. Layout is cool because you can watch some big a.. TVs and get a couple cold ones and appetizer with some friends. If this was in Downtown Summerlin, I much rather go here than the big boy restaurant places now placed in there.   Ordered a lot and pretty much liked everything. Some notes Kare Kare needs more salt but the grilled vegetables were awesome, had the smokey taste without being charred. Props for the bangus sisig thoroughly enjoyed that. Heh Paella was fine, loaded with good amount of seafood, but I think needed more saffron to make it blow up and burn the bottom - isn't that how it should be.. Little crusty on the bottom. Garlic noodles were good for the kids. Liked the fish balls and had the bibingka souffle, need more bibingka flavoring - tasted more like Brazo de Mercedes to me. Liked the halo halo coconut concept. Server also needs to be more schooled in the menu, struggled a lot but then again they've been opened only for a few weeks so lots of tweeking I'm sure. Sorry didn't like the cutting board for the menu holders, too bulky and kids starts hitting each other with it.  Oh also the tables were to small, can't eat a lot if the table can't hold all the food, lol.   Gave a 5 star for a strong showing for makeover of the place and food selection. I really hope they click because it's a great place. Nice paint job outside and finally no graffiti. A great addition to the area, do a smaller same type restaurant by Downtown Summerlin, no competition up here.  Oh and get the website up dudes... Got a nice restaurant but no running website.   My requests if the restaurant looks at what people say, would like churros with hot thick chocolate for a desert selection that would bring me back a lot - hit me up if that happens. No sinagang concept... Also there were jars of fruits for their Vodka, I thought it was ur old fashioned pickled green mangoes or Santol - that would bring me back in a heart beat. Sorry get rid of the cutting board for the menu, or get a smaller one, it slowed me down in ordering, lol.",

    "text": "We seeked out this place because it was recommended by a friend. Location/parking: off the Vegas beaten path. Parking were plentiful. Atmosphere: not your typical Filipino restaurant in decor and setup. That's because this doubles a a bar/dance club. The DJ booth, widescreen TVs, and beer list proves that. Noise was good during lunch but during dinner the music was distracting. These guys need to decide if they're primarily a restaurant or a club. Their great food should give them their answer. Food: we came in during lunch (and returned a day later for dinner). The menu is fusion Filipino and a variety of other cuisine. Those that were not fused, were prepared in some unique way. The presentation was great. This added another dimension because I always thought that Filipino food were meant to be smelled and tasted. Read the menu or ask the servers if you can't decide what to choose. We got the kare-kare and lechon. Both were served in generous portions. The photos and descriptions on the menu were very accurate. Price: about $25 per person. Service: needs improvement, slow, and our server was not too knowledgeable of their menu. Overall I give this place a 5-star because the food were really great and serve with a fusion twist.",

He came back and told me he actually didn't ring it in... Ummmm you probably should've kept that to yourself. I ordered oxtail Kare Kare which was actually very good... My bf ordered chorizo burger... Funny. It was actually a Tocino inside not chorizo.. But it was still decent nonetheless.. Our friends ordered Bangus sisig which was really good too... So pretty much the food was good... Service not so much. If they want this business to be successful perhaps a new server... Wish I could've caught his name... He was tall white with a 5 o'clock shadow..  Oh wait I just checked the menu again.. Perhaps they gave my bf a Tocino Kobe burger instead of the choriburger.. Yet again another server error.",

I ordered something I've never had before, sisig and for dessert the ube bibinka souffle.  I thought I was in heaven!  The sisig was so tasty and flavorful and the ube bibinka was made in heaven.  My server was super accommodating, he knew I was from out of town and gave me the royal treatment and helped me pick out what to eat.

They feature an amazing menu of traditional Filipino dishes like Pinakbet, Sisig, Lengua, Lechon Kawali and many more to choose from. Foods are presented and plated neatly unlike some Filipino restaurants... Never leave this place without trying some of their desserts like the Bibingka Souffle, Turon A la Mode, and Coconut Halo halo. Casual ambiance with room to serve large groups. Well, of course it can't be called a gastropub if it doesnt serve beer/spirits, so if you want that cold one while enjoying your crispy lechon, they carry different beers and mixed drinks on their menu. There is a lot of food to try here, so we will definitely give this placa another visit next time we're in Vegas..",

It was a fantastic example of restraint where the original taste and texture of the dishes were not altered too much, as not to turn off Filipino patrons looking for a taste of home.  We had the lumpianitas that my son proclaimed taste just like Grammy's. The sisig tacos were a natural take on a long time favorite \"pulutan.\" The lechon kawali and bangus sisig were very familiar flavors that we thoroughly enjoyed. We ended our meal with halo halo and the fried suman.  There are a few more things on the menu that we want to try on our next trip. Great job Cuttingboard!",

The exterior is pretty unimpressive but don't let that fool you. The interior is open and nicely done. I started with a lychee mojito which was incredible: fresh mint, lychee, perfect amount of alcohol. We ordered a selection of tapas: roasted marrow, garlic fried shrimp, and lumpias. We also ordered lechon (I think it was called). It is a rice medley wrapped in fried pork belly. We were too full to eat much of that, but it was good. They have an amazing side salad of kale and papaya: sweet, tangy, crisp, fresh. that was so good I ordered extra to go.  Everything was delicious, lovely plating and great service. Another touch we loved was live music! We'll definitely return.",

Was gonna order some San Miguel, but decided to use the free thai tea check-in. Pork sisig was bomb!! Lots of flavor, the pork was cooked perfectly- slightly crispy on the outside with a nice slight vinegar bite that wasn't overpowering. Adobo fried rice actually had a lot of chicken adobo mixed in, which was a pleasant surprise. Also it was topped with some plantains and you know that's bomb.  The service was GREAT, they checked on us a few times and wasn't all up in our business. We actually met the manager Tiffany and talked about a lot of things she's implementing - happy hour, live music, and BREAKFAST! (ube pancakes - what?) Im super excited. She even brought some stuff out on the house. Turon w/ ice cream and this mango salad that went really well with the sisig.   I think the cherry on top was that the prices were solid and reasonable. Overall, great experience and looking forward to coming back again. Start happy hour already! lol  - Sorry about no pictures, we actually couldn't wait to eat it =P",

It was like bibingka-flavored whipped cream, nothing like what a souffle is supposed to be. I had it returned and still the same result at the second round. Was going to have it returned once more but my family and I are already impatient and just wanted to leave. I was boggled because there was so many ravings in Yelp about the souffle. By the way, my daughter's flan was overcooked and the toron is nothing special too. That's a total of 3 different desserts and each at thumbs down!  3-stars is given because it had a great ambience and it is clean; and considering that I haven't yet tried their entrees.   Just not valued at 4+ stars, not for me anyway.   I may go back to give it another try but that's not anytime soon!",

The staff was friendly and polite, and the place had a clean, modern feel to it. It's a little expensive but overall not too bad. I would have to go again during a busier time to decide for sure if it's worth 5 stars, but I'm fairly confident they would impress me just as much during a rush as they would during the lull. I strongly advise going there at some point if you are in Vegas near that area.",

    "text": "After reading previous reviews my boyfriend and I came ready for poor customer service. We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner with his family and upon entering the restaurant with my service dog, we were greeted right away and found our table with his family already seated & waiting for us.  The food comes in large, family sized portions so if you're eating solo, keep that in mind. Otherwise, we ordered what we thought was enough for the 6 of us and we still had leftovers to take home (not that I mind!) The staff here, from my experience were all very nice and accommodating. The only thing we noticed was that no one came to refill any of our waters until we asked shortly before leaving.   We ordered Pork Sisig, Pork Sinigang, and other food that I can't remember. Filipino food is definitely one of my favorites and this place, thankfully, did not disappoint. It was a bit greasy, but I think that's just how most Filipino food is.   If I could give this place a 3.5 star rating, I would. I mean if family want to come here, I would come, but it doesn't stand out to me. The difference between this restaurant and D'Pinoy Joint? Probably the interior, but that's it. The food, just as good. Staff, just as welcoming.   If you're in the area, sure give it a try! Or if family wants some good Filipino food, come here. I hope you guys enjoy your dining here!",

I have this place on my bookmark for awhile ,and was exciting to go try it.   I went in today around 12pm. Explained to the server that we are on a time crunch, so we would like to order asap. After we ordered, the Lumpia came out relatively fast. However, my friend ordered a Kobe beef burger that took about 40 mins. She had to pack that to go. Then, we asked for a check, and then waited for another 15 minutes. The waiter just completely ignored the fact that we told him we needed to leave. We just walked to the front to pay, and our server didn't come acknowledge us. Another person came to help us.   Food wise, I think it's average 3.5 star. The portion is big. I ordered the chicken Insal. My chicken was pretty fresh. The seasoning was okay. I didn't taste the lime but just lots of sugar. The sauce was bland. I did enjoyed my garlic rice that came with it. My friend ordered a chicken adobo which it didn't come with rice. We thought that was odd. She's actually Filipino and she didn't like the dish either. However, I did enjoyed the Lumpia Shanghai. That was quite delicious.   The overall experience was not pleasant mainly due to the service. I probably won't return anytime soon before they figure out how  to manage their kitchen and staff.",

I was craving crispy binagoongan thats why I came back here but this time it looks smaller and they gave us so much pork fat. Like too much.   Escargot is good.   Free thai tea when you check in but only ONE per table.   The servers are okay. Lack of team work. We ordered first but the other customers next to us were served first. Then when our food was ready the other lady server was just staring at the food (like cmon just get it or call our server)  The only server I see that's hardworking is this one guy thats not filipino. He looks middle eastern or something. He always try to find things to do and even though he is not our server he still served our other entree.   Also there's three flies flying around our table.  Our server is okay. She could do better.   Oh when we left, no one bothered to say \"thank you\" I think the owner was there too",

Unless your foreign friends are adventurous with food, this is a great spot to take them for a filipino first.   As a Filipino myself, i love the flavor of all their dishes so far. Lumpianitas is a must every time, and the lechon kawali! Ambiance is great and overall a chill place to hangout in, even on a weeknight. Service has always been amazing as well. Will, our server today was amazing - very attentive and energetic. All these things combined makes for a great experience.

There were 9 of us and we came in a little late already around 8 pm from a long drive from the bay area and there were only 2 tables that are being served. What happened here I wonder? Maybe its just slow for a Wednesday night? I asked the manager if there's a band that still plays on weekends and she said they got rid of it. Then few days later someone told me that they have been having issues with Health inspection multiple times? Not really sure. The place still looks clean and nice including the restroom. In fairness, their food was still really good. We ordered pork and fish sisig, karekare, crispy pata, pinakbet and pork sinigang. We just got upset that they didnt tell us ahead of time that one order of crispy pata has two big portions. They could have told us so that we only asked for one. We tried to cancel but the manager turned us down.  Im not sure if they would still be standing when the time that we come back in Vegas lol.  I just hope that they'll be able to get back up again in case the rumors were True. They deserve a chance...",

I am not an expert in Filipino food so I can't speak on the authenticity, but I have taste buds and they are having a party with every bite I take.  I really enjoyed the fish and pork sisig tacos. Super flavorful! The lengua in mushroom sauce is amazing too, pair it with garlic rice and your taste buds will explode!  I also like the cocktails here, potent and delicious. Service is good too, it may take a little while for you to get your food if it's busy. Expected, when considering that they are making it fresh.

I took my family there and we were all pleasantly surprised. We ordered the ox tail kare kare, sig sig and garlic rice. We also got to try their taro ice cream. He meal was delicious. But it was heavy. You will probably end up leaving with to go boxes because your stomach won't be able to handle all of the savory flavors. I will say, with Filipino food, it doesn't look that appetizing. But it tastes wonderful. Give this place a try. Pretty authentic to the real thing.",

    "text": "One of my favorite Filipino restaurants here in Las Vegas. Too bad it's about 14 miles from where I live. Been here four times now, and I have always been pleased.  This is our go-to place for when we have Filipino relatives visiting us from out of town.   Must Order:   Binagoongan - My wife loves binagoongan and she said that it is one of the best she has tried. Honestly, I am not a fan of this this, but I like Cutting Board's version... it's not too salty! Maximum deliciousness!  Crispy Tadyang - My Favorite! It kinda tastes like the one from Gerry's Grill.  Bangus (milkfish) Sisig - for those who don't eat meat, you gotta try this! (see picture posted - it tastes as good as it looks).. this is a healthy alternative to pork sisig. It's so good you won't feel bad not getting pork sisig.  Fried Chicken - This is always a hit with the kids... and adults...we all liked it!!!   Bone Marrow - because YOLO!  Place was clean and spacious, Service was quick, Food's delish!  What's not to like?",

Otherwise, a definite must try for everyone!!! We had breakfast this time-I had the Ube pancake platter, (Taro pancakes) and bae had the Hawaiian Benedict (Spam) and we were both very pleased!!!! Cutting Board has what it takes to take this to he next level. Invest in training your servers a little better, and you guys will see the biz grow!!!!  Ps-Lumpia here slapppps!!!",

The service was really good considering there was pretty much one guy working the floor (he was greeting, taking orders, bussing, running the food).   The menu offered a lot of traditional Filipino dishes. We ordered -garlic rice -bangus sisig -lechon kawali  -veggie pinakbet  -bibinka souffle   I enjoyed everything! The lechon was fried to perfection. It didn't have too much fat and the lechon sauce was good. It was my favorite paired with garlic rice. I loved the bangus sisig, it had the best flavors. It didn't leave me feeling heavy or as guilty as I would have felt if it was pork sisig lol. I've never been a fan of pinakbet (even when my mom cooks it haha) but theirs was good. The veggies were fresh, my dad liked it a lot. For dessert we ordered the bibinka souffle. It was good, nothing special. The souffle was cooked well but we probably should have opted for the ube flavor instead.  I would consider this place like.. fine dining Filipino food compared to other Filipino restaurants in the valley. The concept is interesting and even tho they make their own twists on traditional dishes the flavors are still there. You'll definitely pay more here than you will at cusina ni lorraine but it's worth it. My family and I enjoyed it, we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I was on the search of finding a new type of Filipino restaurant that was not too far from the strip and stumbled across this place when yelping \"Filipino restaurants\". I saw both good and not so good reviews,but the unique Filipino dishes with a twist peaked my interested to try this place out.  The day we came in was a Good day at the gastropub. They asked how we heard about the place, and I said, I found them on Yelp!!   **PROs: large inviting space when you enter, not your typical Filipino restaurant setting, an industrial-feel like restaurant.  Fast quick service, and great tasting dishes.  We ordered the:   -Sisig- sizzling and crispy!! Very flavorful and although they didn't have Tabasco sauce to add some spice it was still good.  -Sinigang oxtail- tangy and slightly unique flavor, not your typical Knorr sinigang packet type of sinigang  -Grilled bangus- boneless Bangus with grill marks and a mango salsa on top with shredded cabbage coleslaw, was delish and a something not expected. A must try and a healthy dish to choose.  -Pinakbet- my favorite and the best pinakbet I've had! Not too salty and veggies had a nice bite, a must try if you like pinakbet but tastebuds want a change from your home cooked pinakbet.  -Kare Kare- was ok, but very bland without the sauteed bagoong (shrimp paste).  All in all they were good tasting dishes and this review is a 4.5/5!  It was a lot of food for 4 people, we could not finish and brought back left overs.   **CONs: they had a kamayan package available, but the dishes included were not enticing, wished they had more of a unique variety with grilled seafood and more BBQ options.",

The food was amazing! We were basically just planning to have dessert but was tantalized by the array of savory items. We ordered the pancit, lechon kawali, and oxtail soup. These were so fresh and delicious and the serving size was pretty generous and lots of meat in the pancit unlike other places where you can count the amount of meat with one hand!! We also ordered the ube souffle, bibingka souffle, fried ube suman, and several Thai iced teas. My fave was the ube souffle and I enjoyed the different texture of the suman. ThaI iced teas had great flavor and not watered down. Will was our server and he was very informative and patient with us girls. (THANKS!) We got to meet Chef mami Glo - the pastry chef who is this petite and adorable lady that owns the place after having set up the Vegas restaurant without knowing anyone in town. She also co-owns Fort McKinley in San Francisco. I would certainly make this place the place to hit every time I'm in town! You really have to check out the cuisine and the dessert, truly down home delicious yet in a modern and open atmosphere!",

I'm gonna come back and eat all that stuff again",

Crispy, tender, meaty and fatty nuggets. The pork belly sisig was amazing. Hints of sourness accentuate the savoriness of it all. It's one of the best versions I've had. Pair it with their garlic rice and I'm in heaven. I don't usually crave Filipino food, but this place has me dying to go back.",

All of their bangus (milkfish) dishes are thankfully boneless! The kitchen was a little slow but our server Nadine was PERFECT! She was super sweet, very efficient, patient, and just so pleasant!",

I came here on a Wednesday night and It was very calm, there was more than a few customers and the staff was super nice.  The food here was really delicious. Customer service was really good, our server was so attentive and really sweet! (I think her name is Jen)   If you have a sweet tooth definitely try the halo halo, it is soooo AMAZING!! Its a little different,  not traditional but familiar at the same time. I really appreciate that it is served in a coconut. Of course the ube ice cream is to die for. This is something I would order again when I come back, and yes I will be going back even though I live 40 mins away!  The bibingka souffle was very light and airy, the texture reminds me a lot of brazo de mercedes.  It is nice to have if you are craving something  light and sweet!  As for the street food/ apps we had the $3 deep fried balls of awesomeness! (shrimp and fish balls), which is always good to have! The sauce was just okay but the pickled/atchara ampalaya on the side was a nice touch.  The garlic rice was good.  And finally we had the sisig bangus, it was soft but it had a crunch. The seasoning was on point. It was perfection. I don't always enjoy eating fish, but this was really superb!  I absolutely recommend to try this place!",

    "text": "The food was decent. But to be honest, I'm better off making this at home.   Coming from a family who has had many successful and still thriving Filipino restaurants and businesses....You just can't mess up lumpia. Pretty standard! I did cringe when my fiance decided he'd dip it in soy sauce. This, of course, didn't affect the ratings.   Longanisa skewers were a little soft and mushy for my liking. I'm used to longanisa having a firmer consistency. Granted, it's different for every province. But if you don't get the longanisa burps after eating it, it probably wasn't marinated enough.   The adobo tasted watered down. The plantains were a nice touch. But I guess my ideal \"gastropub/modernized\" touch to Adobo would be a little more flavor and some kind of kick to it. I felt like I could have gotten adobo anywhere else it would have tasted the same minus the plantains. I was with two Caucasian people, one who knows good adobo one who doesn't know Filipino food at all. The Who did know adobo said I'd give this adobo a run for its money.   Crispy binagoongan... very good! The pork was perfectly crispy. Eggplant was perfectly moist. I hate when the eggplant is undercooked and they did a wonderful job. The freshness of the tomato and mango was a nice, cool, contrast to the warm pork belly mixed with bagoong. Green onions were a nice little touch! Added more color.   We ordered garlic rice. Can't go wrong there! Always a good staple to have sinangag.   The garlic baguette (ordered by my companions)... honestly I didn't try it. But they barely ate it. I'm assuming it was crispy because it was supposed to go with the bone marrow which we didn't order.   The tamarind ribs. They were good. The server raved about them. And she is right. However the thing that turned me off, I asked if we ordered a lot of food and she said that we need to try the ribs. We could have had 3 more people with us, this leaving us an enormous bill.   Regarding this bill. I have never, in my life, paid 75 dollars for a Filipino meal like this. We added tip. I mean, we ate at ceasars buffet the day before and it was the same price??? I get that it's a gastro pub but I KNOW you're not spending that much on ingredients. This is TOO expensive for family style Filipino food. If that's the price I'm paying, it better be the highest quality of food. And honestly, most Filipino food doesn't need \"kobe\" beef or korubuta pork. I saw beef steak was 20 bucks?!?!?!?! I nearly fainted.   Prices are not friendly. Food was ok. Some of it good. But nothing I'd write home about. I'd rather go to Sariling Atin and pull from their hot trays. Way better for a decent price!   Maybe I just need to try dessert?",

I'm not sure if we lucked out with our server because we had great service! Their service might not be consistent as I compare my experience to the other yelp reviews. I took down one star because of the ambiance. It seems like they were trying to pull off something like ehem.. what Disctrict One Kitchen & Bar has going on but they didn't quite get there. Their ceiling fell short and should have looked more industrial rather than just plain and flat and blah. Their bar lighting is too bright in my opinion and just off-putting in a way.  Let's get to the good stuff! The food the food! The food was quite amazing actually! Cutting Board by far exceeds other local Filipino restaurants. There isn't a single Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas that would compare. It was hard to decide because almost everything on the menu looked yummy. Their beer selection was impressive as well.  What we ordered: Escargot in Spicy Coconut Bone Marrow Grilled Hamachi Collar Seafood Paella in Squid ink (they were out of squid ink so we got it in some type of red sauce) Crispy Pork with Egg Sisig Lechon Ramen Noodles Soup Pork Sinigang Bibingka Souffle Bread Pudding  The escargot was phenomenal, the bone marrow was superb, the grilled Hamachi was so juicy and served with soy sauce on the side, the sisig was to die for, pork Sinigang was with kale and it really worked out complimenting the dish, the ramen tasted like Lomi (interesting but I would probably still stick with Monta when I get my ramen craving), the deserts were both OMG, YASS!!! Everything was a hit except for the Paella. We need to try it with the Squid ink next time.  I have probably said enough. I have decided that I will take my dear mother here for her birthday next month. I will update my review then. Hopefully we get the same experience we did because I am now a fan!",

Honestly I'm not a fan of filipino food, but this place is making me rethink that. The atmosphere is hip and modern. The menu has a great variety of options. The portion sizes are pretty big and are made to be shared family style. We ordered the escargot with spicy coconut which was awesome. For our main entree we ordered the crispy beef short ribs and man they were crispy! The short ribs were tender and nicely cooked. This dish also came with a nice basil sauce which gave the dish a very unique flavor. Our 2nd entree was the bangus sisig. This is by far one of my favorite dishes. The dish was so rich and tasty!! I just wished it had more fresh veggies because it tends to be a bit salty. Overall, I was very happy with the food and the service. I'm looking forward to our next visit as there were several dishes that I would like to try next!",

Great take on Filipino food, upscale food and environment, low scale prices, what else could you want...  Seriously I am shocked this does not have a 5 star.  I am originally from San Diego and recently moved here and so far have been totally disappointed with food and drink outside of downtown.  This place would hold its own against any of the top gastropubs in North Park/San Diego, which is not easy to do, so not really sure what people are comparing this to.  You can nit pick anyplace.  All I can say is thank you for opening a place like this out here in chain restaurant hell.  Please please please people come support this place.",

    "text": "Way to go Cutting Board for helping the cultural food movement in Las Vegas! Bringing Filipino Asian fusion to a town that is known for cultural stagnancy (outside the strip). This ain't your Grandma's Filipino food people so break out of your comfort zone and open your palettes. I was presently surprised myself as I ordered Chicken Adobo hoping for a dish reminiscent of my college roommates grandma's cooking. Lola's dish it was not, but it was a refreshing spin on a classic served with plantains. I also got the Bone Marrow which was a generous portion for the price. I had the halo halo served in a hulled coconut, also a non-traditional spin on the Filipino dessert. I actually preferred it done their way; gelatinous (is that a word?) coconut and jack fruit all the way in the bottom was like a treat at the bottom of your cereal box. I will be back to try the other menu items. Bravo for opening up in NW neighborhood, saved me a drive to the east side for Filipino food. P.S. I love the hipster decor and vibe, nice step up from vinyl chairs and fluorescent lighting that my goto places in LA burbs have.",

Our server was Justin, and he was super helpful with the menu choices. To start, we had the lechon roll with arroz valenciana in the middle - perfect portion for the two of us. The lechon was crispy and tasted great with the arroz valenciana. For the main course, we had the oxtail kare-kare! Masarap (translate: delish)! Lots of meat on the oxtail. And for dessert, we got the bibingka souffle. Light, airy, and yummy! I didn't care for the salted egg that came on the side, but no biggie, I just didn't put a lot of it on the souffle. It also comes with coconut custard that you pour on top, and then you mix it all together. Overall, great Filipino fusion restaurant! We will definitely visit again!",

    "text": "Restroom: clean and smells good. Ambiance: very calm. Not a typical filipino restaurant with loud music or carinderia way of ordering.  Wait period: longer that the usual restaurant. Few customers were here and yet we have to wait for the food like they're too busy. The server wasn't supposed to be pur server she was saying the server will be with you guys in a little bit, but she ended up taking our orders instead because our supposed to be server is also the cashier. Meh!  Food: overrated. They put twists to most of the dishes that some doesn't taste right anymore. We ordered sisig, kare-kare, binagoongan, fried rice, bibingka souffle.  Sisig is ok. It has bell peppers in it. I know it's hard to do the authentic kapampangan sisig but why put bell peppers? Binagoongan is 3.5/5. Among the three, this is the best but it's still not as good to get 5 or even 4. It has fried eggplant, not too salty, a little greasy, but the meat is dry. Taste is coming from the sauce only.  Kare-kare: 1/5. 1 for the presentation. Taste is not kare kare. No peanut taste at all. Vegetables that comes with it are small leafy I don't know what that is, eggplant, zucchini, asparagus. It's very bad.  Fried rice: 3/5 fried rice like pinoy fried rice just garlic and rice but the rice is very soft like sticky rice that has oil and garlic. I bet they didn't fry this with garlic because it has not garlic-y taste.  Bibingka: it's souffle but I don't think it matches the bibingka. Real bibingka is still far better from making it a souffle. This is overrated. It has no taste like bibingka it's like you're eating marshmallow soaked with milk with salted egg. 2/5 2 for the presentation instagram friendly Servers : she's nice and friendly.  It's nice to go here for the place, instagram pictures of the food, but not to eat.  overall experience is 2.5/5 we go to restaurants to eat not to just take pictures.",

    "text": "6/28/16 visit. This place tests the idea of how one would think filipino should test like. It holds True to the gastrobub name by changing up the presentation, and taste of food.  We had gone in the afternoon when it was pretty pavemen + egg type of heat. When we arrived we entered the restaurant, and found out that the restaurant had no A/C. The staff said it was getting worked on. We were given a lot of water during our meal. My husband and I had the lumpianitas, tamarind honey baby back ribs, beef steak and the pork sinigang. All the items were so tasty, and changed my idea of flip food, into fancy cuisine. BUT, the beef steak was too different for me to really enjoy. It tasted like familiar beef steak, but super light on the flavor, and lacked juices. The reason for the 3 stars- the food, service, and price did not match. The server was not welcoming, but that is contributed to a no A/C work environment which we were sympathetic to.  I understand that it is important to be open minded about trying new food, but if the food doesn't pack a punch of flavor along with the kick to my wallet, then I can't say I would do it again.",

The sinigang soup was superb, again best shared the portions are LARGE. I've had both the beef and pork sinigang, I prefer the beef. The last dish was the Ube Souffle, this was amazing! They explain the best way to eat it as well. It does take 25 min to make so best to order in advance, with the rest of the dishes. The presentation of the dishes is nice and the service is good and not too pricey. If you like Filipino food with a twist this is definitely a place to check out.   Update* wouldn't recommend ordering for pickup they jip you on the serving size. I've ordered this soup a few times and when I had it in the restaurant the part I took Togo filled up a whole cup. Then when I ordered for pickup the first time it was two cups. This time it was only one!!!!! For the price I pay for the soup that's ridiculous. Very disappointed",

    "text": "There was a lot of rave and from the things I read, I made my trip there even though it's on the other side of town from where I live.  Let's start off with the customer service. When we arrived, we were seated right away. As we sat down, we didn't even know who are server was at first. It was probably about 10 mins before someone came to our table to take our drinks. Being a first timer, we were skimming through the menu to find out what we wanted to eat anyway.  As far as the food, I wasn't too blown away as far as flavors:   Kare Kare- Dish was great but the bagaoong tasted burnt with a slight sweetness. The 2 together didn't taste good. Kare Kare is my favorite dish out of all the Filipino dishes and I was disappointed.   Beef Steak- The presentation was pretty and the cut of the meat was on the thicker side. It wasn't as flavored like how beef steak usually is and for some reason it had the texture of liver. I have a 9 year old and a 4 year old and they couldn't stomach the flavor or texture.  Lumpia- A great starter. Can't go wrong ordering these but it seemed like the middle was a bit undercooked, the middle was slightly cold while the outside was warm.   Crispy Pata- 10/10 You can't really mess this dish up. Super crispy with the perfect brown color on the outside. Bring some aspirin after you eat this lol! The sauce they bring with this dish is a vinegar/soy sauce blend but it tasted too strong and had a bitter flavor. I actually asked for some vinegar instead for my dipping sauce. Even the vinegar had a different taste. I feel like they try to do a little extra for the sauces they bring with a plate.   Bar Drink: My brother ordered absolute vodka with Sprite and a lime. I didn't taste it but to his disappointment, it lacked the flavor of the alcohol. He had to order another drink specifying to add more of the alcohol.   Coconut Halo Halo- HEADS UP on this dessert: It's served in a coconut, there is no shaved ice and it doesn't contain a lot of usual jellies and lanka. It has the flavors of halo halo but all that's in it, is the meat of the coconut, a big scoop of Ube ice cream, gelatinous coconut and a lot of the beans. I was so disappointed it wasn't the original halo halo. Presentation was beautiful but it didn't hit the spot for me but I did enjoy eating the meat of the coconut.   Our waitress was Anita. She was awesome. I know she was busy waiting on other tables, she did the best she could to attend to us. Overall, the staff was friendly and welcoming. I don't think I'd come back to this place. It's a little on the pricier side if you compare it to DT's or D'Pinoy Joint. I do like that they have a bar and the place is clean and open.",

She didn't know what to suggest then every time I picked one they didn't have it anymore and finally I ordered a crabbies ginger beer and she brought me a regular one when I told her that I wanted the alcoholic one they didn't have that either. If you don't have anything to drink on the menu suggestions would be welcome but she still seemed lost. Okay whatever guess I wasn't drinking the food came out and everything seemed ok lumpia was tasty but then we bit into the chicken wings neither of us got past one bite they were totally bad and even smelled off. We just wanted out of there at this point so we took the rest to go and threw it out. ROTTEN CHICKEN IS NOT COOL. I have eaten lots of subpar chicken wings but serving expired or bad food just doesn't fly. Also just a tip don't leave the bathroom door right by your entrance open especially when it smells like raw sewage.",

Customer service is great, menu is wide, but only wish is that the price wasn't too high for the more common dishes. They defintely serve a very eclectic menu, but I can easily go get the common dishes for a fraction of the price elsewhere. However, the ambiance is incomparable.",
