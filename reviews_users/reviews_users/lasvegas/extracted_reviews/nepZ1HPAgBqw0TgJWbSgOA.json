The staff is exceptionally friendly and they take the time to explain the menu if you need help. This was my fourth time there, and the service and quality of food remains consistent. I've had the ribs before and they were very good. I thought they were a little pricey, but that is very common for ribs. On my last visit, I had the brisket.  It was very flavorful, tender, moist, and the serving size was perfect. For sides we had, Mac & cheese, beans, and potato salad. I enjoyed them all. I've read complaints from others about serving size of the sides, but I thought they were the perfect amounts. The fact that this place is close to my house makes it all the better. I'm a fan for sure.",

We would of had to purchase another drink if we wanted something else to drink! We go here a lot but will not be back! I guess they don't care about loosing customers!",

They basically force you to upgrade to the larger sizes and extract more money. Okay, I get it. So, we ordered the largest coleslaw available and it wasn't even filled to the top.  C'mon, it's just cabbage with watered down mayo and some seasoning. If you make me pay extra, at least fill it to the top. The other sides weren't any better in that regard.  Also, skip the sandwiches. There's a lot of lonely bread; the meat was really skimpy for the price. Basically, a ripoff.  That was the problem. The food was good, staff friendly, atmosphere fun, but we felt like we got ripped off in some way.",

Far as the meats, my ribs were good but not $15 good and they both felt the portion on the chicken was lacking, along the anything special on taste for the price. The sides were small too. Use to normally getting loaded at BBQ joints with sides or at least bread but here not the case. Only drink options are in a fridge or lemonade/tea is prepared. Have to say, if you do go by, have to try their banana pudding! Now that was delish! Overall for Spending $50 for 3 people to eat, I'm disappointed. Had high hopes for this place based on help reviews but maybe we came on an off day or time.  Also, not family friendly at all. Well those with small children. I have a almost two year old, yet no high chairs were seen nor ever offered so it forced my wife to have to hang onto him. Active little boy! Also no changing tables in bathroom. All in all, try it out for yourself. I've had better for less/more but probably not the worse spot I've ate BBQ at lol",

All the food was flavorful,  served with a smile, and cleaned up thoroughly and promptly.  We would recommend Sin City Smokers, Chef Steve and his crew for your event and I'm certain we will hire them again for another community party.",

    "text": "This place has been right under my nose for awhile and I didn't know about it! Thank goodness it was ROTD a couple weeks ago. It's just across the street from the Trader Joe's a shop at a few times a week! Hubby was at home with the kiddo and I said I'd bring home lunch. He was up for anything and I was craving BBQ, as always. I got some loaded fries for myself, tacos for him, some ribs and a free side thanks to my Yelp check-in.   The way the menu is set up is pretty cool. They list all their meats, which you can get as a sandwich. And next to that are other ways to get them - as loaded fries, as tacos, etc. every day of the week is a different special - I remember one day is tamales. You can also buy meat by the pound, do a combo plate and pick out sides and desserts.   I was completely in love with my loaded fries! The fries themselves were done well. And then they were topped with cheese, baked beans, corn salsa and choice of meat - I went with brisket. There were HUGE chunks of tender brisket all over these fries! The meat was so good that it could definitely stand on its own. The corn salsa and baked beans were great additions, too! I'm not usually a fan of beans, but these had so much flavor and were so sweet that I couldn't get enough!  The taco plate comes with two tacos. Hubby had one Pulled pork and one chicken and said he enjoyed both. Part of me wishes I'd gotten to try them myself, but I was happily stuffing those fries in my face...  The Ribs were some of the best I've found here in Vegas. They probably come in second. They had quite a chewy and flavorful bark and the meat was tender enough to pull off the bone.   For my side I chose the dill slaw. It was decent, but nothing compared to my love affair with everything else. And it certainly had a strong dill flavor.   The desserts I'm in the fridge looked good and I might have to try one next time. I can't wait until then!",

Then for sides we had the jalapeno potato salad and the macaroni cheese. Writing this review is even making my mouth water. The tacos were so good! There's a corn salsa and creamy hot sauce on the tacos. The brisket we had just melted in your mouth, so flavorful. The fries were to die for and you easily share with someone. All the toppings are placed on top of the fries, kind of like a nacho style. The potato salad with the jalapeno was just enough to give a kick but not a lot to where your tongue is going to fall off. There's a nice crunch to it with the jalapeno too! Now let's talk about the Mac and cheese. Wow. They call it the smack and cheese. Homemade deliciousness. Definitely getting it again. If you're in town needing good bbq this is the place to go. So friendly and makes you proud to be an American.",

We were throwing a 90 person event so it's a lot to handle but Steve has a lot of catering experience.  They had 4 people on site handling the food and all of my guests commented that the food was absolutely first class!  It's a full service arrangement which includes serving the food, cleaning up their area, and packing up all of the leftovers.  I would work with Sin City Smokers in a heartbeat for any event, they set the standard for BBQ and Catering!  Thank you!",

Someone ordered the fries and I wanted them because they're massive compared to my little one link and some onions... the sides left some stuff to be desired, their Mac n cheese wasn't anything to write home about and I took one bite and didn't eat any more, too dry for me and not enough cheese but to each their own.   The staff was super friendly and attentive so if I do come back I'm getting the fries!",

The services is great, you walk in, you tell them what you want, pay for it and sit and wait.    The decor is not bad, the seating is okay, but the service and food are excellent.  They have beer and wine as well.  GK says, pork out here on the beef brisket. You will find the melt in your mouth flavors are wonderful.  Check it out.",

Located at the intersection of Sunset and Green Valley Pkwy, in the NW corner shopping center. You walk in past all the trophies of owner Steve's competitive BBQ'g days up to the counter. Choice of meats, of how you want them (tacos, plate, sandwich, quesadilla, etc) and your sides ($2 each). They have a section of weekly specials and signature sandwiches as well.  I went with the 1/2 lb Brisket, with Maple Bacon sweet baked beans and 5 cheese Smack-A-Roni. All in, $20+. Sides are a bit small so recommend a double order. Brisket was nice and moist, with good flavor. The baked beans are almost the same recipe as my own, heavy on the maple and bacon flavor....delicious!!! Smack-a-Roni is good too, creamy with a couple cheez-its on top.   Overall, the place is nicely decorated and clean. Service is good and friendly. Food is very tasty. I'll be back a lot I think, as I enjoy good BBQ. And I think they will get better as they work out all the kinks and get everything working perfectly. They only opened 5 days ago on 1/24, and sold out Friday night.  Hours are 10am-8pm 7 days a week. Not sure why but they have a catering page on Yelp as well with a few reviews, kind of confusing which page is which.",

My Mac 'n' cheese with brisket was \"the bees knees\" to say the least, perfectly seasoned and smoked, and paired perfectly with the cheese and mixed to create a heavenly concoction, and it was such a good portion size, I even had some to take home! Fries were delicious as well! I was greeted at every point with a smile, and helpful descriptions of all the food. Seating area was open and carried a really relaxing atmosphere! Prices were more than reasonable, will be returning!",

The mac & cheese was completely tasteless, it literally had zero flavor. I couldn't eat my food, it was really just bad.

    "text": "What's the phrase? Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you. I always try something at least twice, I believe everyone deserves a fair chance.   This place was a one star experience on BOTH visits. First was a lackluster dine in experience where a sandwich consisted of white toast, a small scoop of meat (of which half was fat and gristle), and FAKE American sliced cheese straight out of the Kraft wrapper. Sitting next to that is a huge pile of sliced raw onion (why??) and a gigantic \"pickled jalapeno\" (which is NOT pickled whatsoever, just likely boiled down with no vinegar or spices and is bitter and inedible). Out of this plate of food I ate maybe 3 fork bites of meat. No joke, that's the edible part. Of a full sandwich.  Second visit was tonight's carry out for the family which is as $35 of the coldest, fat soaked food I've ever eaten. And don't think it was cold because we showed up late. We live right around the corner and from our phone call to pickup it was 10 minutes max. Cold chicken quarter platter...so cold my kids asked why it was from a fridge. Cold and wilted \"side order\" fries, maybe 10 total, might I add. Smoked pork tacos that literally tasted like they had ladled the pork fat right on top to make them moist. With every bite, my mouth was coated with cold, flavorless pork fat. I actually gagged and spat it out and ate the corn salad topping for dinner. My husband also said his sandwich had no sauce but was covered in the same fat drenching, making it a soggy mess and flavorless.  Listen, if you've made it this far, don't go there. It's gross, not just disappointing, but gross. Not sure what the deal is with place, but I have no idea how they own and operate a \"restaurant\". I hate to add in the rude commentary, but at this point I am angry these people have taken any of my money with the terrible product they've provided me.",

Beans were nice, but order is on the small side.   Ordered this as their \"sandwich\" method of serving, so it came on two pieces of Texas toast and a side of \"appropriate slaw\". The slaw was a horseradish slaw and was out of this world! This needs to be added to the sides menu! I'd order this all day everyday!

I had the Mac N Cheese, Beans, Chopped Pork, Chicken and Brisket... and on the way in, I grabbed some banana pudding (Not a fan of banana pudding but it looked good so I figured I would hit it up). The food was absolutely fantastic. Once everyone got theirs, I came out and hit it up again. The food was up there with the best BBQ I've had. Their meats were smoky and moist. The sauces were terrific and the banana pudding was amazing. Couldn't of been happier with my meal. I will be stopping by on my own with the family for sure!",

My husband ordered the Porkstar sandwich. I took one bite of my food and it was one bite too many! My husband took two bites of his sandwich and felt the same. The meat of both meals tasted boiled to the point of mush. The sauce was tasty but couldn't hide the horrible taste and texture of the poorly prepared meat. The only saving grace for more than $20 wasted was that a homeless person ate poorly today, but they ate.",

I recently hosted a corporate party for upwards of 500 people at a private residence in the outskirts of Vegas.  Steve was consistently detail-oriented and professional from our first introductory phone call.  He holds a lot of pride in his business (as he should -- the food is INCREDIBLE) and it's evident through his courteous professionalism and passion for his craft.   Now, onto the food.... he makes the absolute best brisket I have ever had.  Actually, I'm pretty sure it's the best meat I've ever eaten -- period.  Melt-in-your-mouth goodness with an incredible array of sides perfect for our audience.  We had:  \"smackeroni and cheese\", mashed potatoes, biscuits with honey butter, three different meat options (brisket, ribs and chicken) and salad.  Each and every item was standout delicious in its own right, but perfectly complemented one another on a (heaping!) plate.    They were on time, set up and tore down quickly, and were friendly and informative for our guests.  I'd give them six stars if I could, and won't go anywhere else when I need a caterer in Vegas.  A MUST TRY!",

You walk in to a wall of trophies that they have one from various barbecue competitions. The smell intoxicates you as you walk toward the register. Everything I have ever ordered there has been the absolute best I have had of that particular type of meal. I never order chicken at a barbecue place - I feel it's a waste... until I tried the chicken here. My current favorite is the B.S.L.T.  That stands for bacon steak lettuce and tomato sandwich. It haunts my dreams. This is the kind of barbecue that would delay air force one on the tarmac while secret service picks up food and brings it back.  This is the kind of barbecue that would make cops and criminals forget their differences and just sit down at the table to eat. This is the kind of barbecue that would eliminate racial tensions across this land. This is not a paid review nor my connected in anyway to this establishment. Although if they were to pay me I absolutely would not take cash I would accept only brisket.",

When we pulled up in front the the restaurant we were pleasantly surprised by the awesome aroma coming from inside. The inside is super cute and I love the license plate lights! The girl at the front was super helpful since it was our first time. She suggested the big daddy plate I think it was called. It came with 5 meats and two sides. We decided to pay the extra $2 per side to get the bigger container. We also got three sweet teas and a chunky monkey desert.   The BRISKET!!! Omg, it was tender and flavorful  the Mac and cheese was different with the cheez it's on top but it was good. The hot links were really good but I wish it was more on the tray. My aunt and daughter loved the ribs and baked beans the most. The baked beans were really good and if you like sweet baked beans then you will love it.  The chunky monkey dessert is AMAZING. I hope they do not stop making it. We only bought one for the three of us to try but we soon realized we will have to be back for more.   This place is for SURE my new spot for BBQ !!!",

    "text": "A nice addition to the Henderson BBQ scene that seems to be growing by the day. My husband loves meat and wanted to try this spot as soon as he discovered it. It seemed like good fuel before our axe throwing league night.   Sin City Smokers Barbeque is located in an older shopping center at Sunset and Green Valley. It's not the nicest looking shopping center so I was pleasantly surprised when we stepped inside the restaurant. The restaurant is very clean and uncluttered. The Texas BBQ themed decor was cute and added to the ambiance. The counter is in the middle of the restaurant where orders are taken and then brought to the table. The entrance divides two sections of seating. The inside of the restaurant is well done for a casual dining spot. The restaurant smells amazing as soon as you walk in the door too.  The menu offers several meats and from there you choose if you want the meat in tacos, a salad, plated, as a sandwich, in a quesadilla, or on fries. There are about half a dozen side options that come a la carte. In addition there are several specialty sandwich options and daily specials. The menu doesn't look big, but there are a actually a lot of options.  My husband and I decided to share a few things. Unfortunately, they were out of ribs so we had to go with another meat. We chose Brisket and Smoked Pork. The brisket was marbled and didn't have a lean option. I really liked the flavor of it and when only eating half of the portion the amount of fat was fine. It would have been too rich for me to eat alone. The smoked pork was delicious and moist. I liked the traditional sauce that came with the meats. It had a little heat and a smoky flavor. The sweeter sauce was good, but I preferred the traditional sauce.   For sides we shared Maple Bacon Sweet Baked Beans and Jalapeno Potato Salad. We both loved the baked beans and they were sweet indeed. I love that they didn't hold back on the maple flavor. The potato salad was good and the jalapeno didn't overwhelm the flavor or add too much heat. The only disappointment was the Sweet Tea. My husband declared it garbage and upon tasting I asked if he had grabbed from the wrong drink dispenser. Hopefully it was just a bad batch and it'll be better next time.  The pricing seemed about right in comparison to other BBQ spots in the area. Most places offer a plate that comes with sides, but even with the a la carte ordering it didn't add up to more than other restaurants charge for a combination plate. It'd be cool if the plated option that comes with onions and a jalapeno included a small piece of cornbread or even a slice of white bread (traditional to Texas BBQ style).  The portions aren't as large as some other spots, but I kind of liked that it was easy to enjoy BBQ without overdoing it. With my husband and I sharing two meats and two sides I'd say that our meal was on the lighter side. Each side made a small serving for each of us.   We'll be back. Hopefully the ribs will be available next time!",

    "text": "Came here with my family today for a late lunch at around 2:30 PM one other family was there eating the atmosphere seemed clean and \"barbecuey\" I was excited to try this place. My father ordered the burger on their specials chalk board he loved it and his fries were delicious. My mom had the Thursday Mac and cheese special topped with burnt ends which looked amazing and my mom enjoyed it. This is where it goes wrong for me though, I ordered a two meat plate with Mac and cheese. The Mac was AMAZING, look I try Mac and cheese every damn place I go it's a sperate food group for me haha. This was very good some of the best I've had out here in Vegas. My first meat was the bbq chicken. It was moist, it was flavorful but it had a touch too much sauce for my liking on it. Overall I would order the chicken again though. The second meat choice was the brisket. This is where it fell completely below par for me. I was served a decent portion of brisket, this portion came from the point (fatty part) and it was undercooked the connective tissues were not falling apart yet(probably pulled out of the smoker an 30min to an hour too early.) It was also about 60% fat so much so that I took it back up to the counter and asked for a different portion. They then gave me a portion of the flat side of the brisket (the lean part) which was cooked perfectly it was moist and tender and had a great crust that tastes like a sumple pepper salt based rub. As someone who smokes quite a few briskets a year I believe they checked the temp of the flat portion which is much thinner than the point and left the point under cooked. The lean was very good and worth the trip out to try. However, I can not recommend the point meat I received any less. This place has trophies all over the place and claims to be championship quality bbq, but the brisket I tried today would say otherwise. I'll be back to try it again someday and maybe it was just a bad quality brisket. I'll update as I try it again in the future.",

    "text": "I'm always down to try new BBQ spots and usually leave disappointed. I didn't leave Sin City Smoker's disappointed, but I left wanting more. I had the Ribs and Brisket, Mac n Cheese, and the Baked beans. Ribs were good, the brisket was good, the Mac n Cheese was good, the Baked Beans were good, but nothing was Great. The sauces were one dimensional in flavor and the rub they used didn't really complement the meat. There are some BBQ places that when you take a bite it tastes special and I'm just waiting to find that in Las Vegas. This place was good and I'd be down to go back, but if I'm shelling out $ for BBQ I'm holding out for awesome or amazing BBQ not just good BBQ which is what Sin City Smokers is.   Also, the sides were too small. Like abnormally small. Especially considering the sides are a la cart to the meats and are ~ $2 each. The size of the side would have been ok had it been included with the meal but to pay for essentially 2 bites of Mac and cheese is a little silly.",

I'd skip the Smack-a-Roni next time though. The Smack-a-roni was not something I will order again. The only real flavor came from the crushed Cheezits topping it.   The shoestring fries must be the Texas version be cause they were regular fries.  They were really good though with that season salt though.  I look forward to coming back for sure.",

I got the chopped pork and ribs and they were excellent! The chopped pork was smoky (but not too smoky) and full of flavor! The ribs were huge, juicy and tender! If you like good BBQ in a less crowded clean place I would definitely come here!! Great food and great portions! The staff is friendly the service was quick!! They played country music, but the food was so good I look past that (). I will be back no doubt!!",

    "text": "On our last Las Vegas trip we arrived at around at 7PM for the purpose of taking advantage of the ongoing $15.99 full rack of baby back ribs special only to discover it had been sold out. This trip we called ahead to reserve only to discover it was unnecessary because there were still 4 left.  Oh well, better to be safe than eat at McDonalds.  I was surprised to find the restaurant entirely empty throughout our stay, perhaps everyone was out shopping?  We were told at the counter of a Black Friday special which included not only the ribs, but one side and a soft drink.  We chose the jalapeno potato salad which was pretty good and added dillslaw which was bland.  The ribs unfortunately were slightly overcooked and served wet much to my chagrin.  Overall, a decent deal.",

The sauce is great, the meat is tender and juicy, and the fat is not too over the top.  You smell the smoke wood when you first enter the restaurant, but the aroma doesn't overpower your meal.  Staff is friendly and willing to go over the menu, the restaurant is clean and cozy.  My only suggestion would be to increase portion size on the sides. $2 is a little steep for one scoop of mac and cheese or potato salad.",

And for those who want details:  The strip mall was deserted, it was late afternoon on a Sunday.  They looked closed due to the darkened windows but that was not the case.  Country music was playing, we were greeted immediately upon entering and asked if it was our first time in.  It was so they explained how the menu worked (super helpful!).  I ordered the brisket on Texas toast, baked beans and coleslaw with dill.  OMFG... Brisket:  incredibly tender!  Our server recommended putting the barbecue sauce and the horseradish on the sandwich.  Being a foodie, I had to taste both the barbecue sauce and the horseradish prior to dressing my brisket.  OMFG once again!  The horseradish was not overpowering and had crunchy cabbage in it (it rocked!).  The barbecue sauce...wow...not sweet, acidic, secret recipe...I added them both as suggested.  Best idea ever! Baked beans:  Sweet with maple coming through nice and strong with a subtle hint of bacon.  LOVED.  It could have been my dessert and I almost drank the sauce left over after the beans were gone. Dill coleslaw:  Not too much mayonnaise (I hate mayonnaise!) and the flavor of dill came through although it was not overpowering (perfect and fresh tasting!). Chicken:  Barbecued perfectly and sooooo tender!  The barbecue sauce on the chicken was different than the brisket sauce; sweet but not overpowering.  Jalapeno potato salad:  Once again, not too much mayonnaise and the jalapeno did not burn your mouth in the slightest, it only added a special touch to what can be a common, boring side dish.  Oh how good it was! Beverages:  Oh the options!  The mint tea (with fresh mint and unsweetened) was so refreshing!  The sweet tea was delicious too.  All brewed on site, none of that crap coming out of a soda machine dispenser!  Also saw a pitcher of cherry lime aid, you KNOW that has to be delish! I'm coming back and dessert will be on the agenda as well as the food! I'm a huge fan.  HUGE.",

Basically, you choose your meat type, choose how you'd like it (tacos, sandwich, etc), and then you can choose a side if you want. The mac and cheese (smack-aroni) was amazing. They also have a ton of sauces to choose from. The decor is unique and we liked the funny signs up all over. The staff was so friendly, what you'd for at a small family-owned business. The only suggestion: It was $6 for a can of local microbrew beer, but we would have also been happy if there were cans of cheaper beer at a lower price (under $5) or pints from a tap if we're paying $6.",

The food didn't seem very fresh either some pieces of chicken were slightly cold. The flavor yes is good especially when using one of the sauces. The flavor of the meat was good. My hubby had the chicken sandwich he said it was just ok and he's the BBQ snob lol! And the side or smack a roni was so small and he said mushy. He also had high hopes Seeing all the pictures on IG made us want to drive and try this place. But it wasn't what I expected. They won lots of trophies which is really amazing. It just wasn't my favorite.",

Sides were Mac n cheese and fries.  2 types of sauces, sweet or mildly spicy.  All were wonderful.  Enough to take home for the 2 of us.  Will definitely be back when in town.",

Not only are the meats delicious and cooked wonderfully, the sides are amazing! I have had their cornbread, beans, Mac and cheese, and for the first time tonight had their buffalo cauliflower- which is why I had to yelp this place tonight- it was delicious! Not kidding, go try all of it!!! They have daily specials as well as their everyday menu.  Their sides are a little on the small side but you get a whole lot of your main dish so it kinda works out.  They also have yummy homemade deserts in their refrigerator like banana pudding, blueberry cheesecake and chocolate lava cake.",

The sauce is a mixture of tangy and sweet.  Even the barbecue chicken, which I'm kind of picky about (my family is excellent at making this), impressed me.  It was not dry! That's the typical problem.  Still, as good as it is, it is not as good as the other two dishes.  The baked beans are a perfect complement to this, as well as the cheesy baked mac and cheese.  This is a throw away your diet for a day kind of meal, but you will think it's worth it.",

For 14$ and change I received the slimiest no flavor \"piece\" of chicken I have ever seen or tasted. The two \"sides\" (the special: vinegar coleslaw was effing horrendous and the mac n cheese equally disturbing) served in a paper ketchup sized bowl. Everything was thrown in a foil takeaway container with a side of raw white onions.   Pitiful.  Also, the people who work here are oblivious and basically retarded. I'm assuming it's their friends and family who have flooded their yelp with positive reviews.   Hands down, the biggest waste of money.

Without hesitation, I was told simply: \"Sin City\". Well, I just couldn't let my husband's Birthday pass without celebrating with some quality barbecue and that's JUST WHAT I FOUND at Sin City!!! The happy faces that greeted me as I placed my order was a welcome change to other eateries I'd been to in the area and then, my heart nearly \"skipped a beat\" when they brought out our orders of a rack of pork ribs, corn bread and creamy coleslaw!! Then I ate......That rack of ribs nearly had me up and dancing with delight!!! Very, very little fat on that rack and maximum flavor-ishous meat with two sauces to go along with it to boot!! The corn bread and creamy coleslaw did not disappoint either and were the perfect compliment to our ribs. The portion were also perfect too. Not too much and not too little either.

There are three BBQ sauces; none are super spicy but all taste good.  The price is right too! My friends like me really like the cheap giant salads. For dessert lovers they have a selection if rotating desserts that are tasty too.  Service is great too, everyone is super friendly. Definitely recommended",

Best bbq I've ever had. We ordered pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork, dill slaw, beans and corn bread. So good, not a day goes by that I don't think about it. My buddy Dennis asked me what I thought tasted best. All I could tell him was, its all good! I couldn't decide....everything was equally delicious including the sides. Truly unbelievable.

The previous visits the owner/ chef had no problem grilling a jalapeno that is served with the food however in this occasion it seemed to be a problem to grill a jalapeno.   As the food arrived I noticed a barely grilled jalapeno.  While my husband got an ice cold jalapeno .   I wouldn't recommend this place.   Las Vegas has way more better Barbecue restaurants.

We will definitely come back in the future!",

I got a vegetable plate that filled me up and was reasonably priced, the french fries were yummy, the barbecue sauce was delicious and the mac and cheese was stellar. I'm about ready to go get dessert may I add to my review in a little bit but would totally recommend it. The people I am with are not vegetarians and said the meat was the best  mosr tender brisket that they'd ever had with which is saying a lot because we had a lot of places. We'll be back!",

It had chuncks of smoked thick cut bacon, very delicious. Also the coleslaw was like none Ive ever eaten before. It didnt have a ton of vinegar..it had alot of fresh dill and tasted very light, I could eat a whole bowl of it, just by itself. The prices were very reasonable and affordable, along with the portions. I highly recommend this restaurant! Great spot.",

Today was my first visit to Sin City Smokers and  The only disappointment I am feeling is that I did not discover it sooner.     I went in to pick up some brisket and ribs to take home and when I took my first bite I couldn't have been happier.  The brisket was beyond tender and the ribs fell off the bone and the sauces are perfectly suited for the meat. Combine this with extremely cordial service will make for a return visit.  Next time will back to dine in to try some of the many offerings.  Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Sin City Smokers... Where to begin? Well, I'd begin 1st off by giving a tip. Go to the right BBQ joint in the shopping center, not the wrong one. I'm still trying to figure that one out. Anyways. I'm a huge fan of Sin City Smokers. From the meats I've had, to the sides, as well as the customer service.   I originally found out about this place from a co-worker of mine. He bragged about the ribs, so I got a half rack with a side for $7.99... Two days later I convinced 3-4 other co-workers to pitch in and we bought FOUR racks of ribs with two quarts of sides and eight cornbreads. That's how good Sin City Smokers is.  I've had their food three times now, but I've only had one type of meat up there. Ribs. Thank you Lord for those ribs. I smell the smoke when I get out of my car, and I taste the smoke in every bite. The ribs aren't exactly \"fall off the bone\" tender, however they are tender. They have a little bite to um. But I don't mind a little bite in my ribs.   The only sides I've had are the maple baked beans and the mac & cheese. Those beans are so sweet & tasty though. I can remember exactly how they taste as I'm doing this review. The mac & cheese has \"cheeze-it\" crackers crunched and mixed in the macaroni & cheese, which is unique, but in a good way. I plan on trying the Texas Ranchers beans next time I go.  I'd highly recommend Sin City Smokers if you're in Henderson and want BBQ. Hell, I'd recommend them regardless of where you are in the Vegas Valley. Its well worth the drive!",

The Texas Melt consists of angus beef brisket (wonderfully tender, moist, and flavorful,but not soggy or overcooked), pepper jack cheese, roasted red peppers,Texas red sauce and grilled onions on buttery Texas toast, and tasty but not too hot picked peppers on the side-so incredibly good and so bad for you!    The place has cool bbq headquarters feel to it and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.   My only quibble is the 5 cheese Smack-a-Roni-mac n cheese, which nobody at our table liked. I'm pretty tolerant of processed cheese but it had a very yucky cheese wiz taste to it not the 5 cheese mac they're going for. I almost had the porkstar sandwich which is crammed with it.   That aside the brisket was just awesome. It a cut that's so difficult to barbecue that it's a measuring yard of a good BBQ restaurant. Here in town I've had overcooked crumbly brisket and stiff as a board dry brisket (from the now closed Pot Liquor). This brisket is just perfection and I will be back!",

We have a BBQ place we like to go to in North Las Vegas. I'm glad to have found a place that is near us finally! I'm from Texas and I'm quite a snob about my barbecue!! The portions were amazing as well as the prices. While I'm trying to eat better these days it's unfortunate this place is so close to us!! Haha!  I tried the lemonade and sweet tea. That was my only hang up. I wish the tea was a little sweeter as well as the lemonade. I had the pork star and my husband and I shared the bad ass fries. Amazing!!! I'm so looking forward to coming back here again!!",

From first contact all the way to service delivery, Christie looked after us and ensured that everything we asked for was adhered to on our wedding day. The brisket was insanely good, everyone at the reception commented on it - even a Las Vegas veteran who knows his stuff about eating out said it was the best brisket he'd tasted in town. That says a lot! The quality of food, service and value for money is impressive, I highly recommend these guys for any wedding reception or event function. They clean up pretty good to like they were never there. They will not let you down. Thanks again Christie! We appreciate all you did for us (and for the leftovers the following day, tasted EVEN BETTER, especially that macNcheese - oh my gosh...... I'm drooling typing about it!!!! Haha)",

Well done on the price point guys! The service was awesome as well! The energy the 2 girls in the front put out make the place an even better experience. The owner is always there from the sound of it and after speaking with him about his passion it just made for a perfect meal.  I'm stuffed!!!",

I don't recommend the mac and cheese. Idea is better than the execution. It's essentially kraft plus chez-Its. My only real complaint.       Ive liked: BSLT, Brisket (was as close to being in Texas that I've had), Texas Melt and baked beans. ..good lemonade  (not too sweet).       Friendly service. Really clean. Food fast considering the quality.     If you read poor reviews about this spot...I say do two things. 1 compare and contrast other Henderson options. If you been here more than a year you understand. 2. Look at their review history. You'll see what I mean.

Reminds me of a few small town BBQ spots I've been to in CA & AZ. The gal upfront was very polite and cheerful, told her I was a newbie and was asking what her recommendation was. This spot has daily specials and everything looked good, so needed to narrow it down. The sandwich options looked awesome, was told that the porkstar would quench the beast in my belly. Glad I listened, it was an amazing grilled cheese and mac & cheese with chunks of chopped pork. As an added bonus, with a checkin on yelp you can get a free side. The shoestring fries were pretty good and loved the seasoning they came in. The sandwich was perfect and stuffed with piggy, mac n cheesy goodness. All in all was a really good small place to grab some great grub for a good price. Will definitely be back for more.",

They keep it's simple with their 6 meats to choose from and you build from there to make any thing from tacos/quesadillas to the Bad Ass fries which are a favorite of mine! Everyone should have them on their must try list when visiting this establishment. I like to add the smoked pork to my bad ass fries.  I have also tried the bbq chicken on a sandwich, DELICIOUS.  They also offer daily specials. I happened to go on a Sunday when the special was the Brunswick stew, DELICIOUS! Very filling and stick to your ribs good.  The fries are in a league of their own. Very well seasoned and addicting, I couldn't stop myself. The way the meats/meals are served is traditional of how bbq is served in many parts of the country (over raw white onion with a grilled jalapeno) If you don't like it simply ask for your dish plain.  Anyway I'll definitely be back for some more delicious bbq, looking forward to trying more of the daily specials which I've heard are (ALL) great!",

    "text": "I rarely write a poor review, but this business was an exception.  I went based on the reviews in Yelp.  I ordered the special of the day which was a base of mac and cheese, with pieces of \"burnt ends\" of beef brisket.  It was then supposed to be covered with more mac and cheese and fried jalapenos.    It  arrived in a tin foil take out bowl (even though I was eating in) accompanied by a plastic fork and knife.  The mac and cheese was lukewarm, with a not more than 5 small pieces of meat on top if it.  The mac and cheese was only OK, but the meat was terrible.  Burnt ends (at least in Texas) are meaty and juicy.  Here half of the meat was just fat, and the other half was dried out and incredibly tough to eat.  There were a few small (less than 5) small pieces of jalapeno.  The waiter came over to ask how the meal was.  It told him it was terrible.  The meat was dried out with little flavor.  In virtually every other restaurant when I tell someone that I don't like a dish, they immediately offer to replace it with another dish and often offer to refund my money.  Here at Sin City, he simply stared at me when I told him how bad I thought the food was, and offered me nothing.  I then got up and left.  Unfortunately a very poor experience all around.",

Brisket was very tender, but full of fat and almost inedible. Mac and cheese was ok. Husband's hot links were maybe 5 pieces of meat and onions and peppers. He said was good, but not very much meat for price. Overall, mehhh, we won't be back.",

    "text": "I would say that this place is among the top 3 BBQ joints in he Las Vegas valley.  As with all BBQ joints, I tried their brisket as a baseline... Their brisket was quite fatty, and it was definitely juicy.  A little too fatty if you ask me, however, at least it wasn't dry.  I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauce that came with the brisket.  It was very vinegary.  What really shined here was the bark on the brisket.  Perfect texture, not too salty... Just excellence.  The house black BBQ sauce was very good too.    We had the creamy dill slaw for a side which was decent, bit a little heavy when paired with the fatty brisket.  Service was excellent.  Pricing was fair.  I am excited to try their other offerings at another visit.",

    "text": "Bruh.   A friend has been posting pictures everytime she goes to lunch here,  all over her facebook. Im not big on BBQ, to be really honest,  but Dayyymmmmm.   So, i Facebook stalked the SCS page. Every day,  they post a video of their chef making that day's special.  Guys. Don't watch.  I've gained 50 pounds this week.   Okay, so, fast forward to two weeks, to when my man and i finally have a day off together,  and i begged..... (not really). This place is a 35 minute drive from our house, and we have other errands to run.  But.... lunch.    We walked in. It's CLEAN.  It smells like heaven. Its got the decor you'd expect,  and i loved. I wanted to steal several pieces for my kitchen   So, we walk up to the counter, and a lovely blonde gal (I'm so sorry for not catching your name)  asked if we'd been in before,  and we admitted we had not.  She explained the menu completely,  taking her time when we had questions, or looked overwhelmed (i have HORRIBLE anxiety in new places, so she was a big help)   Our order: we decide we're going to try a few things,  and share. We end up with spare ribs over badass fries, the catfish plate, and mac and cheese  GUYS. Bomb. As. Fuck.   Catfish was the best I've had in Vegas.  The fries were crispy,  and perfect. Im a dipper with fries (ranch, mostly) - i didn't use any sauce, they were good enough to not need any accompaniment.    I don't know what else to tell you here.  Friendly service,  great food, we'll 100% be back next week for Thursdays special.",

Made the mistake of tipping as you pay first, then realized the only service provided is them bringing the food out, they do not come back and check on you. Drinks with the exception of the tea is sold by the bottle or the can. Very hot inside the restaurant, fans were going but the heat contributed to a loss of appetite. Sides are too small for the price being charged, but the jalapeno potato salad is wonderful. Saw on another review that they have a loyalty card...we were not offered that.

I checked in on Yelp! so I could get a free side.  Since I already had the macaroni on my sandwich, I decided to go for the potato salad.  Also equally amazing.  They put a jalapeno and onions on the side of your dish, so you can choose whether to pair it with your sandwich or not.  I loved every last bite.  I opted for sitting outside so I could bask in the desert heat.  The bread that it comes on is too thick for my liking, but it is extremely filling.    The staff are sweet and accommodating.  One thing I'd change is that there are no beer/alcoholic drinks, at least from what I gathered.   Other than that minor detail, this is a great spot and pricing is on point!",

There isn't anything about this spot that I don't like.  We came in and noticed that the special for Thursday's is the \"Smack Daddy MAC and Cheese. It's a 5 cheese mac and cheese topped with burnt ends and fried jalapenos and my husband ordered the Texas Melt Sandwich. This food slaps and it slaps in a good way!!! I usually take pics of the food to post it along with my review but I totally forgot because I was in a trance with the smell of the food!! My husband and I didn't say a word... nothing, we didn't wanna talk and just wanted to enjoy our food.   Let's jump to the very next day which was Friday (day 2). I got out of work early and I called my husband to see if he wanted to sneak away for lunch, we both had the same thought because we both agreed to go back to Sin City Smokers. So Friday they have the \"Full Rack Friday\" it's a large serving, it has always 10 bones and my husband went for the brisket sandwich. You know the food is going to be good when you can smell the wood!  The meat was so tender and juicy that it would fall off the bone! I love being able to distinguish the different spices and when I got a taste of oregano, it was over for me. I didn't wanna share with my husband no matter how good his sandwich looked.   Not kidding... we went back on Saturday... we couldn't stop taking about this place to my son that he had enough and said \"I gotta go to this place\" so there we go.. on out way back.. for the 3rd time!   At this point, the staff already recognized us and because they have a loyalty problem.. we just earned a free meal for our next visit. We ordered the Porkstar, the Whole Hog and The Texas Melt. Words can't describe how amazing these sandwiches taste, needless to say, my teenager is now on the same page as us and is now a huge fan.   So here we are... we broke our perfect attendance and didn't go on Sunday, but we definitely considered it. We'd seen signs around the restaurant about a Memorial Day special on Tri-Tip. We love Tri-Tip and if anyone was going to do it right, it was going to be this place.   My husband ordered the Tri-tip sandwich and I tried the Tri-Tip tacos and we decided that this was definitely our BBQ spot and won't try anywhere else..   Im kinda disappointed that I haven't taken a lot of pics to post, I get lost in the sauce and completely forget!",

    "text": "I'm not one for writing bad reviews because I love to eat so I always want to have good food. I waited a couple of weeks to write this review probably because I just felt bad about it. After reading all the reviews on this restaurant I really wanted to check it out with my kids so we went on Father's Day. First let me say it's a neat little restaurant with a very cool kind of atmosphere. Though I did have a good time the food was just okay. Keep in mind this is my opinion because I know this place is loved by many locals.  Upon walking in I see an amazing menu on the wall but am informed that the items I would like to eat are served on a day specific basis and that today's special is the Father's Day special of prime rib. Well okay, I happen to love prime rib and this is Father's Day so that's what I will have. I added a side of Smack-A-Roni Mac-n-Cheese because I'd heard such great things about it. Brittney and Jeremy both ordered beef brisket with mashed potatoes as I did and the Smack-A-Roni Mac-n-Cheese. Alex ordered the Whole Hog sandwich and Kelsey the Bad Ass Fries. We sat at a picnic style table with benches and the smiling friendly server brought us some warm pork skins. I've never been served pork skins in a restaurant before and I have to say that these were really pretty good.  I realized as my prime rib was being placed in front of me in a tinfoil pie dish that they had never asked me how I would like it prepared. I was also expecting a cut of meat as you would get at any steak house or even buffet here in Las Vegas. Instead what I received was a pile of room temperature meat along with 3 quarter cup to maybe half cup sized plastic containers with green beans mashed potatoes and Mac-n-Cheese. The Smack-A-Roni Mac-n-Cheese tasted like regular macaroni and cheese with crushed Cheez-It crackers piled on top. The prime rib was room temperature, full of fat and I was given plastic utensils to cut it with. The mashed potatoes were dense and stuffed into the container and also room temperature. I believe the warmest side order on my plate or in my tin where the green beans and the macaroni and cheese. I don't want to say that the food was bad because it wasn't it just wasn't great and I wish it was warm as it just come off the grill or oven or BBQ or however it is prepared but it wasn't.  Brittney and Jeremy did not even finish their plates and these are two kids that absolutely love BBQ. The barbecue sauce that came with their dinners had a very strong chemical aftertaste and the barbecue sauce that we got from the bar tasted like a vinegar hot sauce you would get on chicken wings. Not exactly the barbecue flavor we were looking for. Kelsey's Bad Ass Fries tasted really good but after a few bites you would also get that chemical aftertaste of the barbecue sauce that was on them. Alex however loved his Whole Hog sandwich and downed it at record speed. I wasn't going to write this review, as a matter of fact I was just going to skip it altogether but as I've sat and thought about it I remember sitting with my food hearing the proprietor discussing with someone how he wasn't going to sacrifice the quality of his food yet there I sat with a pie tin full of fat and room temperature meat and a plastic knife to cut it with.The Au Jus really wasn't even warm. Now I'm not here to be negative about any restaurant and at some point I will probably go back and try something else because I know that there are good and bad days at any establishment. I just wish on Father's Day it would have been a better experience.

    "text": "My love language is brisket and Sin City Smokers knows what they're doing with my meat! I've been by a couple of times to try a few different dishes but my go-to protein is the brisket. There's only a couple of places in town to get this cooked well and SCS offers the most variety of preparation. Check their IG for daily specials, like fried catfish and turkey around the holidays.  PLATES: Your choice of meats and sides, in addition to brisket their hot links have a good kick and snap. Their mac is definitely my preferred side but their beans are also solid.   SANDWICHES: The Texas Melt is my favorite thing here, so crave-worthy. Plenty of thick, fatty brisket topped with pepper jack, roasted peppers, onions, and sauce. It's a huge portion and super messy, but oh so good. Trying another sando next time!  SPECIALS: The Big Daddy Mac is definitely a dish to share, thanks to the load of FIVE cheeses. It's nicely balanced with a bit of brisket and a fried jalapeno topping for contrast. I'm not a huge barbecue chicken fan (because it's often dry), but the tacos here are loaded with flavor, sauce, and slaw.   LOCATION: A little tricky to find and likely often confused with another BBQ joint in the next plaza but well worth seeking out. Staff are friendly and attentive, love the rustic decor. Wish this spot weren't so far for me, would definitely come regularly to make my way through the menu- baked potatoes, brisket quesadilla, and tamales are on my list to try.",

Put your order in, SHOW YOUR YELP CHECK IN FOR A FREE SIDE, pay, then wait for your smoked yumminess to be served in a foil bowl.  What makes it special is the slaw has dill herbs in it, the mild green whole pepper is smoked, the mac salad has cheese crunchies on it and the chix, brisket and catfish was juicy and soft.   When done, bring your tray next to cashier to throw out empty items.  Oh yeah, they have cobblers, too.",

I've been to a few spots and was not impressed but not disappointed. This place on the other hand, I was very impressed with the selections and the flavors!  I usually can not decide on what to order, because everything looks so damn good. Being indecisive, I was able to order a5-meat platter! Yup this entree had 5 types of meats and two sides! Heck yah I was able to order something where I could try all of the meats I wanted on one plate. My overall favorite was the brisket, it was so soft and juicy- the bbq sauce made it 100x's better, I literally was in heaven. I can't wait to come back and try the signature sandwiches!",

Asked for lean meat and they have me the most marble piece of brisket they had! Then when they attempted to correct my order, they spoke loudly about me in the back, making sure I heard every word of how this is \"how it is and that it doesn't get leaner that what it is\"... anyways they came back with attempt #2 and tried to hide all the marble on the bottom of he sandwich.  Absolutely the most unprofessional bunch of people!  They certainly showed that they know what I was talking about since my top sliced where lean... but then why put all the fat at the bottom of my sandwich?!?! Just to be vindictive? All I wanted was to have lunch and these clowns just wanted to be pests!  I asked for my money back and they wanted to charge me for the sides which I gave them back. Such pettiness! This place was an absolute disappointment!   Find another BBQ spot!",

Brisket, Pork, and Hot Links with a side for under $20 was ab amazing deal and it was the best lunch we had in a long time.  Was so nice I brought family over for the second visit and now taking home even more goodness for the third trip. Protip: The Big Daddy Platter is a wonderful deal! 5 meats, two sides, and toast for $27 after tax. Can't get that anywhere else!  Highly recommend for those looking for cheap, good, local BBQ!",

When it finally showed up (side note postmates isn't prompt) I took it to my desk and opened my container and saw 3 slices of brisket.......COME ON!!!! REALLY!!!! They look delightful but only 3. Let's talk taste. I do love the crust but 2 of the 3 slices weren't that tender. But pretty good flavor overall for the brisket. The dill slaw is just bad. No dill flavor, old lettuce with whatever you call the sauce that was on it. Just mayo would have been better. I took 2 bites and threw it away. With delivery fee and tax I paid $22. Not worth it. Good luck Sin City Smokers!!!",

I've seen so many positive reviews about this place and that's why we were interested in trying it out. Then another party of three arrived after my party completed their order and just like us, it was their first time visiting the establishment and once she established a rapport with them she became a bright shining star. She explained everything and we learned about the company via the next customers. She explained the specials, the wall menu, the easier menu that was posted right in front of the register WOW???... just think instead of having to bob and weave just you read a menu!!! Now the young lady that was next to the cashier was just the opposite - thank you for that!

I feel as though the cashier rushed my order and wanted me to order my meal quickly. Once I decided on my order another group came in and right away they recieved warm and friendly customer service and were explained the menu in detail. I will not be back. If your black this may not be the establishment for you.",

The new hubs and I decided to do it ourselves for our wedding over Memorial Day weekend. I contacted a bunch of places, as we weren't sure what kind of meal we wanted, but we knew our budget. Christie's reply was prompt and professional, we met shortly after for a tasting at their Henderson location. She gave us a number of options to fit our budget (120-150 wedding guests) which included service, entrees, sides, bread, and beverages on a per person basis. And the food!! - I took one bite of that juicy chicken, I wanted to slap my mama it was so good!   The contract was clear and unambiguous. The couple of times I did have questions before the big day, Christie was responsive and helpful.   The day of the wedding, they came in promptly and set up in the designated area. Service was flawless and everyone had more than enough to eat, with tons left over. As we surveyed the party, everyone was full and more than happy with the food. It was just what you want from a vendor on your wedding day - totally uneventful, professional, and polite - everything just worked!!! We (the tired bride and groom) feasted on the leftovers they thoughtfully packaged for us for the next couple of days.   All in all, this was the best day of my life and Christie and her team helped to make that happen. Thanks Sin City Smokers, looking forward to booking you for our next event! (and stopping in for dinner next time we find ourselves in Henderson)  - Mr. and Mrs. BerryWhite",

Here is my experience: we got there, the menu is on the wall, we had to order everything before we can seat. There's a paper towel roll on the table that you can't move, when the food comes, the only utensils they had to eat the BBQ are plastic and the food is served in \"to go\" containers. The dressing salads aren't as good as they should. Everything is A La Carte.  The meat was good, is the only reason why I put 3 stars, everything is terrible which should be reviewed by the owners and have it on their consideration.  I thing for the price we paid for the dinner, it's like a high-end restaurant for the price but eating at a fast food restaurant for the service. Do you imagine eating BBQ, Steak with a PLASTIC fork and knife??? We don't.   Not very happy at all, but at least we tried.",

First off the brisket was insane good, moist, fall apart with a great tasting bark. The pork was also great, more of a Carolina chopped style but still tasted fabulous. The beans are sweet which I like, they definitely don't taste like your typical Q place beans and I like that. Smack and cheese was good, it had crunched up cheeze it's on top and was really creamy. I am glad that a real Q joint has opened up near my house because I will definitely be a long time customer!",

Is too damn good not to taste! The meat is perfect! Seriously! And the rest of the food compliments the meat so well. The flavors are addicting! Big hearty portions and good prices. Make it how you want or try the daily and weekly specials. And if you don't know what you want, you can't go wrong with their signature sandwiches. The best.

Christie was responsive, friendly and helpful through the whole ordering process for catering (delivery) an event for my family.  Food was delivered on time. They brought plastic ware wrapped in napkins, plates, wipes and a plastic table cloth (which we didn't need). The ribs were amazing - the meat fell off the bone and it was not dry.  Extra BBQ and hot sauce provided.  The smoked BBQ beef was flavorful and tender.  The cornbread and biscuits - perfect, moist and delicious!  Everyone raved over the vinegar coleslaw. The salad was fresh, provided with ranch and Italian dressing.  Roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes - very good.  But the red beans with rice? Mouth watering. We were afraid the fruit trifle would be too sweet but it was not - every single dish was thoroughly enjoyed.  Thank you, Sin City!

It seemed to be that they had some regular customers in the restaurant when I was there.   Food: I ordered the rib plate and added 2 sides (cole slaw and beans) and a water. $21 for lunch. A little pricey, but I gave it a shot. Ribs were St. Louis cut, 4 bones and garnish of onion and a jalapeno were included. The bones weren't cut through and I was unable to cut them with my plastic knife; the kitchen had to cut them through for me. Ribs were OK, a bit fatty. The sides tasted great, but it was a SMALL portion for what you paid ($2 each).   Will I go back again, probably. But I'll try something else next time.",

Secondly, the owner Steve, is a BBQ champion, he has more trophies on display in the restaurant than you can shake a stick at.

Her comforting assurance that my father's Celebration of Life would go smoothly, that they would feed all who attended, and could even stay later than planned to help out with any hungry stragglers if necessary, helped alleviate some of our stresses and brought buoyancy to the heavy situation at hand. After phoning my sister to let her know I'd found our caterer, she suggested a few changes to my menu choices. Without problem or hesitation, tweaks to the originally planned menu were made, and from burgers to chicken to German potato salad and grilled fresh, seasonal vegetables, all of the food was delicious. They supplied all the necessities: plates, utensils, napkins, condiments, and I was assured, too, they would clean up and vanquish all remnants of their presence, that we wouldn't even know they had been there, and True to their word, it was so. They did, however, leave all the excellent, leftover food - another blessing in a time of deep grief. Christie was there serving up kindness and smiles along with the spread, and griller Matt was amiable and skilled; they made the event all the more relaxed and cordial.  Thank you, Sin City Smokers,  for your excellent food and service and helping to make our dad's celebration a great success!",

    "text": "I am unfortunately getting to this review a little bit later than I would have liked. Sin City Smokers catered my wedding which took place at an outdoor location back in April.   First: Picking our food and our setting was incredibly easy and affordable.   Second: they came fully prepared with all the necessary equipment, and tableware making the set up incredibly easy on us. The serving went off with out any problems whatsoever.  Third: (and most important) the food is excellent. The portions were great. The beef brisket was so popular, we had none left over. The sides were also great, especially the Mac N Cheese! We found that the portioning was almost spot on. We had just enough left over to enjoy.   Special thanks to Christie for helping with all of this and making it work out great.",

I had the rib sandwich with spicy barbecue sauce and a side of potato salad. They chopped my ribs and placed them between two pieces of Texas Toast. Literally one of the best barbecue places I've been in quite some time. The owner, Steve, was very nice and is always there. I'm a BBQ Catering Owner and very picky about BBQ. Trust me, this place is great! Thanks Steve!",

    "text": "First off...everything was spot on.  Before you order: after perusing the menu on the wall, be sure to take a glance down below the register...posted on the front of the bar/counter are three other menu items not listed with the others. One being the Big Daddy Platter for $25: five meats, two sides, two Texas toast.  Two of us shared 2 ribs (nice and lean, wonderfully tender), 4 brisket slices (also trimmed, nice and lean), sausage (hot links? tasty and flavorful), chicken, and pulled pork (not fatty, moist and yummy), beans and fries.    I decided to add the Special that day; BBQ Lasagna for $7. I know it sounds weird, but was amazingly addictive. It was definitely different, but we couldn't stop taking bites of it. I would call it a BBQ Casserole, though. :)  After throwing on a couple pieces of cornbread to boot, we stuffed ourselves silly, and still had more than half of almost everything to take home.  Everyone was super friendly and it felt very homey to eat in there. The decorations were eclectic and charming, including a quite full trophy case and oversized check from a competition won.  Unfortunately, we didn't see the desserts in the case until after we were done...or had any room for by that time...but we will make a point to try a couple the next time, because we will definitely be back!",

Juicy brisket, sauce still wasn't anything to write home about, and the spicy one was too spicy for me. Crazy Mac and cheese made with a few different types of cheese. It had cheez-its in it which gave it a cool texture but I don't like cheez-its. So it won't be my choice next time. I would like it if they had a veggie side dish  They even had a veggie selection for my vegetarian friend! Who said the veggie quesadilla was amazing!  I'm going back Wednesday for their baked potato special. $9 and sounds pretty good!",

The aroma is out of this world, wafting into the parking lot, it hits your nose like a ton of bricks, in the most delicious way possible.  The atmosphere is very comfortable especially for a bbq joint.  Casual sit-down. Nice decor.   The service is very friendly! I ordered online via yelp and the blonde who greeted me when I picked it up was vert nice and even let me use the yelp check-in to add a free small side to my already-completed order!   They got the order correct and accomodated all my requests (cut sammich in half, sauce on the side, etc)  Brisket was tender.  The bbq sauce itself is delicious!  I really like the sweet bbq!  They put a bunch of dif flavors in the bag so I could sample them all! That really made me happy!  Now to what I didn't like.  Again, keep in mind that everyones tastes are different.  I am simply writing my personal take on the food.  Food was very greasy. I understand bbq isn't exactly health food.  And I am by no means a health nut.  But when the flavor and mouthfeel of grease is what stands out in a dish, it takes away from the experience.   The food was missing that \"wow\" factor.  I can't place my finger on it but it just didn't \"hit the spot\" for me. I ate the food, but I found myself wishing I'd gotten something else.   Maybe other items of theirs are more up my alley.  Give it a try for yourself! I hope you love it.",

All in all very good barbecue with average pricing for what you get. Staff is very friendly and only issue is that the server had to cover the register as well which left a few plates like ours sitting a little longer in the pick up window then I would like.

I entered the place and went to the front to look at the menu on the wall. I saw what I wanted and waited by the register for a few minutes until someone came out from the back. They were kind enough to explain some of the options on the menu and I placed my order.   I went with the Brisket ( a 1/4 lb) and it came with raw onions and a pepper. I really just wanted meat, raw onions are not appetizing to me  but the grilled pepper had some nice flavors. I also had a 1/2 rack of ribs. The ribs were decent, nothing out of this world or something I would go back for. The brisket was dry and I was thankful they put sauce in my bag so it was more edible. It did have a nice outer crust and smoke ring, just not juicy as I have had it elsewhere. Looking at the different sides I went with the mac and cheese, they call it another name but that's what it was. It was a super small portion, a few bites and there is a cheese it on top. I see all the trophies when walking in and I hope they do well here but I would not be a return customer.",

    "text": "Sin City Smokers is Hot & New.  Actually, they're not new to Las Vegas.  Sin City Smokers is known around town as one of the best BBQ catering businesses in Las Vegas.  They're also known throughout the country and have placed 1st place for \"Best Ribs\" a ton of times.  Check out their trophy cage located inside their restaurant.  It's pretty impressive.   I heard rumors over a year ago that Sin City Smokers was planning on opening a restaurant in Las Vegas.  And finally, they're here.  Sin City Smokers is known for their ribs, but it's the brisket that brought me here.  If they have good ribs, they must have a good brisket too.  Besides, I usually skip pork and not a huge ribs guy.  The menu isn't stacked like the rest of the BBQ restaurants in town.  Their meats consist of ribs, hot links, BBQ chicken, and brisket.  Pick your meat and then choose how you want it served.  I chose to have the brisket with their Texas toast.  I have to admit, the brisket is one of the best that I've had in Las Vegas.  The brisket was a combination of fatty and lean, which is just how I like it. It was also tender and had that smoked flavor to it.  It's a good thing that the brisket was good because the Texas toast was a little dry.  The brisket was so good that I ended up eating it by itself with no sauces.  If I had an issue with their brisket, it's the portion size.  I got about 6 oz. of brisket for $9.99.  Additional sides are $2 and I got their Maple Bacon Baked Beans.  This was pretty good.  I just thought it was a little small (less than a cup) for the price.    Overall, I have mixed feelings about Sin City Smokers.  Las Vegas has a lot of BBQ restaurants in town, especially in Henderson.  For the price I paid, I'm used to getting about 8 oz. of meat, sometimes two different types, and two sides.  Also keep in mind that they don't hook it up here.  The menu is also missing beef ribs, tri-tip, burnt ends, turkey, etc.  I'm not saying they don't have it or can't make it.  It's just not on their menu.  The sides for $2 each are on the smaller side too.  But then again, I didn't get what they're known for and that's their ribs.  The reason for the 4 star review is because their brisket is so good and worth coming back for. I just wish the portions, including their sides, are a little bigger.    TIP #1: Located off Green Valley and Sunset, where Sumo Sushi used to be located.  TIP #2: Check out their Weekly Specials.   TIP #3: Signature Sandwiches also on the menu (3 pork sandwiches / 1 beef sandwich)",

Gotta love that Smackaroni (mac and cheese). I live for the daily lunch specials on Facebook. We typically eat here once and week, and I've also ordered food for potluck at work and no one is ever disappointed. This is a family owned spot, and you will likely see the Dad (owner) when you visit. He is super friendly and approachable and dang passionate about his food! We recommend this place any chance we get, and go here as often as we can! Prices are great for the portions you get. I've yet to be disappointed and I'm salivating just writing this. The staff is friendly and it is always a peaceful environment to eat. Love all the decor on the wall and the smell when you walk up is heavenly!",

Same with their excellent brisket. My friend had the smoked sausage with beans and rice and while I didn't care for the beans and rice she gave me a couple pieces of her sausage because she has a very small appetite and I swear it was  some of the best smoked sausage I've ever eaten. On my way out I stopped and got a carry out order of  sausage  so I could freeze for later.  I had read so much on Yelp about the maple baked beans and I have to admit they were terrific.  The service is excellent by some of nicest people.   You order at the counter and they bring it to you. The place is very rustic and very \"down home\". Everything is served in plastic and aluminum containers but who cares... the food was outstanding. So glad we found this place and we know we're going to be back before long.  Oh those awesome ribs!!",

I was recommended the brisket melt and it did not disappoint.  I would highly suggest this to anyone going to give that sandwich a go.  It had great flavor and just the right amount of moisture within the brisket.  The bread had a nice crisp crunch that you would expect from a proper melt.    I would totally make every attempt to come back and eat here whenever I'm back in Vegas.  A bit off the strip however it's exactly what I was looking for which would make it more of something the locals would eat.",

The collards were watery and flavorless and my sweet potato was fair. We left bummed that after $50.00 including the tip that we did not find value.

Silly me, I needed to call in my order for brisket days before. But he did come home with some ribs. They were big and meaty and covered in just enough bbq sauce. They were amazing! So my husband also stopped off at Famous Dave's to get the brisket I was craving. He spent way too much money and the food was not that good. We cannot wait to go back to Sin City Smokers to have their ribs again, and if their brisket is just as good we have a new favorite here in Henderson.",

Brisket fell apart, but too much grizzle; links spicy, but amount of meat for a two meat plate was skimpy. NO bread served.   $22 with a drink seems pricey. Got iced tea and shocked to find NO SWEETNER except sugar in a jar and there's only one jar for the entire restaurant.  On day I was there it was 89 outside and a/c was not on inside.

The girl that helped me was super helpful and friendly, give that girl a raise! So the baby back ribs were good but not sure if it was because it was their Friday special, but the rib meat seemed scant on those bones. But they were tasty and I even liked the sauce, I am very picky with my sauce so I was pleasantly suprised. I tried some Mac and cheese with the cute cheese nip topping, it didn't do it for me, it was very bland, very plain. Then some cornbread, huge pieces, that tasted great but was terribly dry and crumbly. I grabbed a cheesecake from their fridge before I left, I can't pass up dessert. Well, I wish I wouldn't have...you may like it but it was too \"cheesy\", not enough sweetness. I'd get their meat again for sure, skip the rest.",

The menu is cool you pick the meat (or veggie) you want and then how you want it, plated, sandwich, taco, fries, quesadilla, etc.  Since we were ordering for several of us we opted to order by the pound.  We ordered 1 rack of spare ribs, 1/4 lb brisket, 2 hot links (we were told 2 links = 1/2lb), veggie plate, quart of mac and cheese, quart of potato salad, 3 corn bread and a sweet tea.  Our total before tip was just under $100.  Price was around what we normally spend when getting bbq so that wasn't an issue.  Food was good.  It just didn't blow anyone away.   Didn't seem like we got 2 hotlinks but maybe it was a 1/2 lb and that is closest to 2 links.  Hot links were our favorite part of the meal.  I could have done without all the onions, peppers, jalapeno, etc, that in some form was on every meat.  It didn't affect the taste of the meat that I could tell.  It was more of a garnish.  Maybe it is a regional thing?  I think the hot links had more veggies than the veggie plate.  Mac and cheese was topped with Cheez-Its that was a nice touch.  The potato salad had jalapenos but wasn't spicy (that is not a complaint just fyi).  The cornbread was sweet and had great taste but was extremely dry.  Their house made bbq sauces were really good.  They have a regular and spicy.  They had several puddings in the drink case.  On the day we were there they had banana pudding, peanut butter and jelly (with nutter butters!) and a third I can't remember maybe funfetti or something like that.  When we got home we wished we would have gotten them.    They have daily specials that look great red beans and rice, bbq tamales and what I am most looking forward to full rack of baby back ribs on Fridays.  I will def be back for that and hopefully update my review.",

My 1st and only visit some cook or chef had to come out of the kitchen to greet at the counter after I was standing there for 5 minutes. I got too much info too fast and was handed a paper take out looking menu. I asked the waitress or cashier that was at the counter I I can take time to go over this menu,  she said sure have a seat she'll take care of me.  I sat at a table for 30 minutes confused by this menu and I had questions but no-one came to my table. A couple walked in sat down behind my table ordered and was served  in 15 minutes while I was still sitting after 39 minutes.  So I walked out. I don't know how the food tastes but that's the worst service I've ever experienced in a dine in restaurant in my life.",

Wanted a sample of different meats like most places have; they don't offer any. Everything is al la carte. Menu says $2 for sides then they show you that the $2 price is literally a tablespoon so you'll need to pay $6.99 for a pint or $11.99 for a quart of one side. No mashed potatoes, very limited selection. Ordered their \"Bad ass fries\" and received these plain ass fries with nothing as advertised (picture). I ordered to go so I didn't check my food until I made it home and was pissed. Underwhelming and disappointed is an understatement.  My nine year old summed it up best with \" Dad, I don't really taste much meat so I'm just dipping it in the sauce\". My thoughts exactly. Severely Overpriced. Don't waste you time nor money. I would've glad shelled out more elsewhere. This puny portion set me back $70! Never again",

Second, SCS did a fantastic job serving the food to our team in a friendly and professional way. On the day of the event, the setup, service and clean up was attentive, thorough and without issue. Finally, SCS were extremely professional before, during and after the event. We are completely satisfied with SCS and won't hesitate to cater with them for another event.

We went for dinner, was very surprised to find that you only get 4 ribs with the pork ribs, and the size of the sides were ridiculous.  The sides were not much bigger than the little cups that you get your salad dressing in at most places!  I had the brisket, it was ok at best!  Odd to have raw onions with it..... No texas toast or anything else, just 3 pieces of meat and to very small sides.  So dinner for two, rib meal, brisket meal, 2 sodas, and tip it was over $40 dollars.  Most likely wont be back, staff was alright, the one seemed new which is not a problem.  But as far as quality for value.......very poor.",

    "text": "As a connoisseur of fine BBQ you can understand why initially I was skeptical about using Sin City Smokers. After they came and set up for the party of 30+ people I still was a little concern. Steve was outstanding. The brisket was the best I ever had. The BBQ and the Chicken was outstanding. The people at the party were so impressed that they all asked for Sin City Smokers brochure. These guys are amazing. The questions that should be asked. Would you hire them again for any future parties? The answer is absolutely yes without question!!!!!!",

Every person at every event loved the food and the atmosphere that the set up created. The staff and management were always there to answer any questions and the set-up and execution of the event was on fantastic, never had any worries, they were spot on. I would recommend Sin CIty Smokers for there professionalism and consistency and competitive prices. I now manage a Catering Company (Plaza Catering) in KC and Denver and can say that Sin CIty Smokers was and is a good one.",

Steve is so accommodating and willing to work with our budget and able to put my mind at ease with not having to worry about anything related to the food; the plates, the cutlery, even the table they set up on and trash cans! Their baked beans were amazing and their sausage and chicken were a crowd favorite. Definitely would recommend them.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. They are close by and they did are licensed unlike the bbq trailer set up in the lot next door. But this place is bad. First there was no air conditioning in dining area. The food is totally a la carte. Doesnt see bad at first but the total was high for a place like this. Brisket just the meat $9 I asked for it chopped and what I received seemed to be the pile left at end of chopping board. Black, fatty greasy mess. Couldn't even eat it. The sides at $2 each are limited and the creativity to the beans and potato salad did not pay off. They also come in little cups smaller than a Snack pac pudding. Very stingy for inexpensive items. Sauce was either spicy or too sweet. I asked for bread because it is not listed anywhere but it was nothing special. For two of us it came to $34.95.  Only one other customer and service was very slow. The girl serving us had long brown hair flying around with no net or hair the the health department requires. BBQ is limited in town but I will be driving out to the Texas joint on St Rose Parkway from now on. Too bad this area really needs good restaurants.",

They served some of the best bbq I have EVER had! Their smackaroni and cheese is out of this world good!!! My guests were talking about how good food was for weeks afterwards.  Their customer service and attention to detail far exceeded all of my expectations!",
