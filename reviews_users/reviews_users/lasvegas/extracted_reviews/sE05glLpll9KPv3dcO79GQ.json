    "text": "Me and my boyfriend were visiting Fremont street and got hungry.  We had been spending ridiculous amount of money on strip food so this place seemed like a real bargain.  I kinda liked the decor.  It was an 80's jungle theme.  Our server was very nice and attentive. Most of the food was not very good.  I got quite a few items that I only took 1 or 2 bites of. I think it's funny that they advertised it was a steak dinner buffet and what they served was thin strips of  carne asada.  It was still yummy though.  Just not what I picture when I think of steak.  To get full I had to make 10 trips to the carving station, they are very stingy with the meat. Bottom line- I didn't get sick, I got full and it was really cheap. Would I go back? No.",

    "text": "Don't be fooled by the False and negative reviews on this place. I've eaten here twice and will constantly go back.  I enjoy buffets immensly. I think it's the idea that I can keep going back to try many things all for one price and I know that that's why I enjoy The Paradise Buffet so much.  First of all, the place is dirt cheap, even by Vegas standards. 8 dollars for lunch anywhere is pretty good, but in Sin City, it's an outright steal. Plus, it's cheaper than Hometown Buffet, slightly more gourmet, and best of all, void of annoying children running around eating nothing but jello and pudding.  While the selection is a little on the low side, the food is actually quite good. The roast beef was rare and flavorful, the mashed potatoes were thick and fluffy, the salad bar was full of green, fresh lettuce and a great variety of toppings for it. They even have an option for your own burgers and hot dogs.   The atmosphere is defiantly jaded (but so is most of old town Vegas) and yes the waiters/waitresses seem to be on the tired side, but those are things I can easily overlook when it comes to cheap, tasty buffets. You can spend 35 dollars on a buffet at the Wynn or you can drive 5 minutes up to Fremont and have lunch for next to nothing...and keep all that extra money to win big on their cheap tables.",

It was gross. The eggs were gross, the sausages were OKAY, but really greasy. The french toast was harder than a.. I don't know, it was HARD and barely edible.  The desserts were overprocessed cafeteria food, I'm sure you can find better in an old folks home.  For lunch I tried the lemon chicken and chinese food - and lemon chicken tasted lemony, but had too much batter. I tried a few other items like meatloaf and macaroni and cheese and it was way overdone.  I guess people that don't really know better or what good food is thinks this place is okay.",

What I did not expect after being seated was to be blindsided by SAIMIN on the menu.  Yay!  Disclaimer: I am a white girl from Oregon who is no saimin connoisseur, but I have had what is billed as excellent, authentic  saimin before.    This stuff is not the caliber of Hamura's on Kauai, but for what I expected from seedy Fremont, it's not bad!  The pork is a little well done and it's heavy on bok choy, but the flavor is good.  For $5.89 in Vegas, I'm not complaining.",

    "text": "This place popped my Vegas buffet cherry. And it was a pretty sweet first time.   We were all dying of starvation and heard about the awesome buffets on Fremont street, so we chanced it on the Deuce to see what we could find. We picked the Fremont Casino because let's face it, we were on Fremont street and it was poetic.   Here we got the champagne brunch and I do believe it was $11.80 with tax. Other people here are saying like $7 but I didn't see that at all, maybe I was too smitten with the words \"champagne brunch.\"   I worked on stocking up for the apocalypse at this buffet. I think I had bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, french toast, and some fresh fruit for breakfast. After that we digested for a few minutes then I had prime rib, mashed potatoes and gravy and then some ice cream for dessert. Impossible? I think not. The french toast was surprisingly good and the sausage was awesome too. Another big plus was the mashed potatoes and gravy, I know I shouldn't fill up on carbs at a buffet but they were SO GOOD! And let's face it, I got my money's worth any way you slice it.   They came around for drinks and I decided to make my own mimosa, ordering orange juice and champagne. I emptied my champagne into my OJ and then when I came back from the buffet again there was more champagne in my glass! Thank-you champagne fairy!   The atmosphere was dark and just funny. It's being paradise and all it was tons of fake plants, but it was so great for a Vegas buffet. We didn't regret our choice at all and we could barley walk when we left. And yes, I would consider that a glowing review lol.  Side note: After rewatching Swingers, yes, this IS the place where Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau go to eat breakfast at the beginning of the movie. If that doesn't sell you, I dunno what does!",

    "text": "Really 2.5 stars I went on a Tuesday evening, for the seafood buffet. $19.99/person  Pros: snow crabs legs are pre-cut to allow easy eating. Service was good. Plates were whisked away and drinks refilled rapidly. Selection of seafood items was surprisingly broad. Oysters, peel and eat shrimp, cocktail shrimp, scampi, fried shrimp, fried calamari, cioppino, crawfish, smoked and prepared salmon, tilapia, mahi mahi, trout, mussels, maki, and sushi, maybe more I'm forgetting  Cons: most items were just good or ok. Nothing was great and a couple of things ( scampi and cocktail shrimp ) were yuck. Desserts uninspired complete with soggy canoli. Smoky atmosphere bothered my asthma, but this is Vegas, so that isn't a fair complaint.  If you are down here and you love crab as I do, its worth coming here and eating for the price. Don't expect to be blown away, but you can find something you enjoy eating and get your money's worth.",

    "text": "The Paradise Buffet is a nice small, inexpensive buffet on Fremont Street at the Fremont Hotel & Casino. I was not very impressed with the decor. It is like sitting in the middle of a jungle. It is quite bright in a colorful way. A bit on the gaudy side to me. But I look forward to going back again. There are a few things there that make me say that. First of all was the service. I sat down and within moments someone came by to take my drink order. When I sat back down after getting my first plate my beverage was there and the glass never went empty. I don't mean that I didn't drink much. I mean that before my glass went empty each time a new glass was brought to may table. Every time I finished a plate, cup, or bowl within moments of me setting it aside it was whisked away. I am very surprised that for a small hotel buffet the service ranks as high as some high priced restaurants I have been in.  Another thing that surprised me was the quality of the food. I was not expecting such good food. The buffet is not very big but what they have is big on flavor. The roast beef was succulent and had a flavor that lets you know what a good beef tastes like. It was also very low in the fat department. I have been to some places where their beef was fatty and just ruined the meat. The Mexican lasagna was one of the best low cost dishes I have ever had. I am quite impressed with the food quality. I do see myself going back again.",

I went there late at night and my husband and I were both drunk and usually everything tastes great when we are drunk but not this time. My husband ended up eating a plate of mashed potatoes because he said he used to love the mashed potatoes that they served in high school and these reminded him of  them.

The champagne was free flowing, the server was attentive. They have stone crab claws & peel & eat shrimp & the prime rib was delicious. Good salad & dessert selections too. For the $11.99 price each with B card can't be beat. Highly recommend",

Next there are stand alone buffet restaurants.  You would not compare a BMW 7 series with the 5 series and conclude that the 5 sires is substandard.  That said, Paradise buffet deserve a 4.5 stars in its own class: downtown and price.  In my opinion, it's the best.  If you are willing to drive to downtown, this is the place to have buffet.  Parking can be a little difficult but  you can find a parking structure with 4 hours validation in the casino.  With price conscious people, every dollar counts.  This buffet offers many varieties:  mainstream American: meat and potatoes, Italian: pizza, pasta, Mexican: enchilada, taco, Asian: sushi, fried rice, etc.  They are all good, not exceptional.  Oh, dessert is also good.  Service is efficient.  Walk out to the bar right outside and get a $1.00 beer .  Bring it in.  The price for the buffet depends on theme night: Friday for seafood, certain day for prime rib but regular night is around $12.00.  The wait depends on season and certain day and time.  You can call to check.  What else do you  want?",

I stopped by since they advertised fresh sushi for the dinner and the sushi was not very fresh at all. The rice was slimy and they packed a ton of rice with a small amount of fish. The selection of rolls was pretty pitiful - they had tuna rolls, shrimp nigiri and a roll with seawood inside.  I went on a Sunday night which was \"prime rib\" night. The prime rib was tender and they had all the condiments you would want with it (parmasean, horseradish, etc) which was good.  I loved their Mexican section. They had some mildly spiced carne asada with fresh cilantro as well as guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, lettuce and more. I was able to make an awesome taco salad.",

    "text": "Mom was in town from Maui for one of her famous gambling 'binges', so since she was staying at the lovely Fremont Hotel & Casino in Downtown LV we ended up going to the Paradise Buffet.  Friday night, Seafood 'Fantasy' night!  But alas, it was all just lackluster.  I'm sorry but I even forgot to take pics of my encounter with this lacking buffet.  I know for many tourists (especially Hawaii folks) just a buffet in general with all-you-can-eat crab legs is an endless wonder.  But when you're an LV local like myself you kinda expect more from your buffet!  Paradise Buffet was just borderline OK for me, not much I could find outstanding.  The crab legs are decent and plentiful at the buffet, but most of them are cold!  I like my crab legs warm, but there is not really any station setup for them to serve warm crab legs.  I don't think you can hand one of the chefs your plate and ask them to steam them for you either.  Wouldn't that be funny!  All I can say is please don't try this.  Do not interfere with an already disgruntled, busy chef.  That's asking for trouble!  Most of the other offerings at Paradise Buffet were lacking as well.  The baked fish was alright, but after sitting under the heat lamp too long some pieces were tough.  Just FYI, if you go on a Friday night, it is mostly SEAFOOD being offered!  So if you're a meat-only type of person this is not your night.  Although they do serve a nice prime rib with au jus, which probably was the best thing I ate that night.  Medium-rare, extra au jus, and creamy horseradish on the side?  Made for some good eating.  But this is Las Vegas, every casino here has some kind of prime rib...it's practically a staple!    The other seafood choices didn't impress me much.  The fried clams were either soggy or overcooked.  The pasta was eh, just pasta.  And the Mexican offerings that night were NO BUENO.  Just flavorless.  Don't get me started on the sushi that is served RIGHT NEXT TO the soft serve ice cream machine!  Talk about fusion!  Unfortunately the sushi was just plain terrible, dry rice & suspect raw fish.  Even the basic Cali Roll was falling apart.  Besides the prime rib, the only other saving grace at this buffet for me was the sandwich station located at the salad bar.  Yes, the sandwich station.  Make your own sandwich with thinly sliced ham, turkey, or roast beef!  Then pick a cheese or 2!  I think only cheddar & mozzarella was offered that night.  A roast beef & turkey sandwich with cheddar and a ton of mayo helped save my sanity.  It wasn't gourmet, but it was familiar.   Hardest part about this buffet for me to swallow is that it's like $22 per person, that's with the B Connected players card!  Without the card it's an extra BUCK.  For me the value just wasn't there.  You can go to a local Chinese buffet with all-you-can-eat crab legs and still pay less than you would here.  And you can get Mongolian stir fry included!  And the very same soft serve ice cream machine.  Sorry to say Paradise Buffet, not impressed.  You're not bad, but for the price I would have rather have gone to a Station Casino buffet for less.  It might not have the crab legs but I could have done without them.  But don't get me wrong, the tourists love you!  #crabby",

    "text": "We were searching for a place to hold our family reunion that would accommodate a group of around 16 people and give us the food options that we wanted. It was suggested that we check out the Paradise Buffet since others had had good experiences making reservations. I called more than a month ahead but was told that they would not be able to take our reservation because it was Memorial Day weekend, but if we showed up at 4, when they opened, they would be able to seat us together. There would also be an 18% gratuity added automatically. So I said okay, let's do it.  Our group of 16 showed up slightly before 4. The woman at the register didn't even look up from what she was doing to curtly inform us that the buffet didn't open until 4. We let her know that we just wanted to let them know that we were going to have a large group and wanted to sit together and would pay on the same check. She said we could just wait in line and they'd see what they could do. Grrr... At four, we all went through the line and I paid for the 16 people (we had collected the money previously.) The total came out to more than I had expected but I brushed it off, thinking that my math had been off somewhere. We were seated at four different tables in the same area, as each table could only hold between 6 and 8 people.  The buffet wasn't anything special. We were there on their steak night, but the majority of the food was pretty buffet-standard. Pasta, mashed potatoes, chicken, vegetables, desserts, that sort of thing. But the food was good.  It began bothering me that the price was more than $20 more than what I had expected it was going to be. So I decided to go to the register and ask for another print out of the receipt. When the cashier handed it to me, I found that they had charged me for 18 people, not 16. But they were nice when I brought it up, and were prompt in giving me a refund for those two non-existent people.  I don't want to give them anything more than a three because it wasn't amazing. The service was okay, the food way okay, and if it hadn't been for that mistake with the payment, I probably would have given it a 4. I hope they're more careful in the future.",

The food was mediocre, which come on, is what you expect on a buffet, and if that were the sum of my experience at the buffet, I would have given the Paradise Buffet more stars.    However, I am 99% sure I had some bad oysters on the buffet.  Which, shame on me, I live in Louisiana so have no business eating oysters in the middle of the desert 1500 miles from The Gulf.   So, that was a downer.  But, I'm a lover of kitsch. And the Paradise Buffet has this in spades, in an un-ironic, before the hipsters took over sort of way.  The dining room looks like it is a leftover set from The Golden Girls, but with more tropical floral patterns and crystal chandeliers.   Now the food itself.  I went to the Seafood Spectacular, or whatever it's called, and  had a coupon.  There were piles of seafood in every direction.  And they split the crab legs for you because as Americans, that's something we can't even do anymore.  And like I said, aside from the suspected bad oysters, it was all mediocre, so just kind of meh.  If you're set on having seafood, you could do worse.  But, if you're just looking for cheap eats, head across the street to The Four Queens and chow down on the $8.95 Prime Rib Dinner, which was actually very good.  Viva Las Vegas!",

    "text": "So my friends and I were a little off the strip to check out the amazing Golden Nugget pool, and we came across this buffet.  We came on a Saturday night, which was like steak night? I ended up paying ~$20 for dinner-- which wasn't bad.  The interior was like a dark rain forrest. I guess that was the theme?  As for the food, it was decent. It wasn't the besttttest, but it was good. I really enjoyed how the chef cooked their steaks -- on the spot! However, if you like it medium-- GO FOR MEDIUM RARE, just because they tend to overcook it. The sushi selection was limited, BOO TO THAT. As for the rest, it was alright. I did enjoy the PECAN PIE DESSERT -- AHHHH HEAVEN. There was also KING CRAB LEGS AND FRESH OYSTERS. So yay for that. Oh, and they also have smoked salmon-- which was fairly interesting.  As for the service, it was decent; however, I did not enjoy when the waitress took my plate FULL OF KING CRAB LEGS, that wasn't touched :( What a waste of food. Oh, and there were these little flies that were constantly around my plate, which is why I marked one star down. I was definitely a little irritated with these flies-- hopefully they fix this insect problem!  Overall, it was a decent buffet. I wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area.  Turn Ons: -STEAK! -PECAN PIE!  Turn Offs: -Small flies were always around my plate.",

    "text": "This is the cheapest buffet that I considered in Vegas, but you get what you pay for. Plus, parking is only free if you get a validation, so remember to save your receipt.  Granted, this place is in the Fremont Casino on Fremont, instead of south on the strip with the better and higher end casinos. I figure that is why this place is cheaper, but the food was not that good and the dining area could have used a good remodeling. Basically, this is in an older casino in the older part of Vegas that is last on the list of where tourists visit.  I also do not recommend getting there at the cut-off point between breakfast and lunch, because there is a several-minute delay in when the lunch items are brought out. When we went there to pay, we were told that we had 2 minutes left in the breakfast buffet and if we paid for that, then breakfast items would be cleared soon and we could not get any of the lunch items. And so we opted for the lunch buffet. Really, is the food police going to care whether I grab breakfast or lunch items?  I went ahead and grabbed a few breakfast items anyway, such as pancakes, bacon, and country-fried potatoes. The bacon had little to no taste, but the pancakes and potatoes were pretty decent. Then when some lunch items came out, I helped myself to those. The best thing there was the chicken breast.  Service is practically non-existent, and we ended up having to grab our own silverware and condiments. At least they took away dirty plates in a timely manner.  This buffet may be cheap and the best in the Fremont area, but that does not factor the strip into account. Next time I would pay the extra few bucks somewhere down south.",

It was noon and they pretty much had breakfast options and it was not a big variety. I would say maybe 10 different options not including salads and deserts which was mainly just cake/pie slices. We were disappointed and thought no wonder it was so cheap. I would not come here again. I like a huge variety of food options. But the location is beautiful with good service.",

Perfect as we thought we'd miss out on a seafood buffet visiting Monday through Thursday, cause all the buffets we checked had the seafood usually on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Seafood included Dungeness crab (cold and hot), cold was better, cause hot, wasn't, and was overly salted. Cold was just fine tho, with the shells cut for easy opening. There were also raw oysters, boiled shrimp. Fried oysters, shrimp, calamari, and clams. There was also snow crab. The New England clam chowder was too salty. If you got there early enough, you got to try their delicious cooked clams.   There was a small selection of sushi. Carved roast beef with au jus, fresh or creamy horseradish other fixings. Fixings to make your own tacos. Meatballs and spaghetti. There was a full salad bar with a good variety for fresh items. Dessert was the typical variety of pies and pastries. Key lime pie was nice. Fresh fruit was limited to cantaloupe and honeydew slices. The self serve ice cream was very creamy and a nice end to a satisfying meal.",

I went back a second time and got some salad and other items that are different than other Boyd properties including pulled pork.  The dessert selection is OK.

I mean, you get what you pay for and noone is trying to say otherwise. Paradise wasn't pretending to be anything else than a cheap buffet on Fremont. THATs why I loved it.   The decor was awesome too! I mean come-on, how often do you go into a restaurant and feel like you're back in the 60s or 70s or watching Casino! It was great.  If you're pretentious and too \"fancy\" to eat in a place like this, than go to strip -its all good.   Please don't get me wrong I have no problem spending money when the food is great but this time around we had so many misses and lots of expenditures that it was nice to not overpay for inexpensive food.",

Many of the dishes were missing key ingredients that changed their flavor profile completely.  Out of the entire buffet I found only 2 dishes that were even edible.  The sushi was just as horrible, for example the California rolls were very sweet, I believe it was in the rice, maybe instead of rice vinegar they used corn syrup? Lol, not sure really just gross.  The deserts were also a complete let down, some of the pies were even crusty like they sat out all day.  This was one of the worst buffets I've been to.",

There are people who absolutely love seafood night so that's why I'm saying. I'm not particular but was there for seafood night. It's people mad dashing the crab legs section and putting as many legs as possible on their plates. I had one crab leg but I don't have the love of crab legs enough for me to wrestle with it and pulling out a few chunks of meat for me to go back.   It's a great buffet if you're in the Freemont section. I'd go back for sure. Do me a favor. Don't ride the zip line if you're feeling queasy. I don't want yack on me as you fly through the air over the hoards of drunks. Thanks.",

The Paradise Buffet at the Flamingo Casino and Hotel is one of the most sorry excuses for a buffet and the second-worst buffet I have eaten at in Las Vegas.  The buffet is hard to find, hard to get to, the selection is limited and the food just isn't good. While most buffets in Vegas pride themselves on seafood, the Paradise Buffet had very little of it.    The center portion of the buffet is dedicated to shrimp cocktail and crab legs, but unlike the Aria Buffet or other top venues, the crab legs are not cracked open. This buffet also has some sushi, but it is dry and had been sitting out for a while. The sushi selection was also very limited and was the worst I have had in Las Vegas.  The rest of the buffet was nothing more than home cooked items like pot roast, macaroni and cheese, Caesar salad and boneless chicken. It was almost like an expensive, glorified Old Country Buffet. But at least with OCB, you didn't have to pay like $20.  Of course, if you check-in on Foursquare you can save a few bucks on the buffet. But it is Vegas, and who wants to stand in line to save money on a buffet. Just put that five bucks into the machine instead and let it ride.  Best bet: Skip this buffet and visit the Flamingo to just see the flamingos outside.",

Wednesday & Saturday = Steak Night $13.99 Sunday, Monday, & Thursday = Prime Rib Night $17.99 Tuesday & Friday = Seafood Fantasy $13.99 *These prices all take the B Connected card into account.  If you don't have one it will be $1 more.  I came on a Wednesday which was a Steak Night.  I love meat and the steaks are freshly grilled and seasoned the way you like it.  I really don't know what cut of meat it is but it is pretty good.  Don't expect gourmet steaks but it's fun!  The grill master was super kind and remembered that I like it medium rare when I went to get my second steak haha.  The meat itself is pretty thin so that they can cook faster.  The fried chicken was surprisingly good!  It was juicy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I also liked the potato bar... cheese, chives, butter, and sour cream.  Fatty style.  The desserts were not impressive.  They had a lot of choices to choose from... cheesecake, pineapple upside down cake, custard pie... but none of them were that great.  I just stuck with the vanilla soft serve and oreo chunks.  Service was great.  Our drinks were always refilled before they reached the bottom.  I haven't had the Seafood Fantasy or the Prime Rib, but I would probably choose another buffet for that type of food.  Steak night is fun though!  Try it out if you are in downtown and want a $14 buffet.",

My husband and I were walking down Fremont Street, when we saw the sign with the prices for this buffet. They were definitely appetizing to our wallets, so we walked in to see what it was all about.  We didn't go in that day because we had already eaten, but we do keep in mind for the next time we came. We ended up coming again, and went into the buffet. We paid under $20 for both of us, and ate very delicious.  Their selection was good! Since it was the day after Thanksgiving they did have turkey and him, but they also had things like fish mashed potatoes fried rice lasagna salad shrimp soup etc. etc.   We're going back today, because when we went last time we didn't have enough time to enjoy it. This time we're going to sit there and enjoy it!   The customer service was also great, except at the end my husband and I got an ice cream and they didn't want to let my husband leave the place with his ice cream.

I have no idea when that website was written, but we paid something along the lines of $12.99? I can't even remember. But it definitely wasn't $7.99. Anyway, it was still reasonable in our mind, so we walked in.   BEWARE! They stop lunch service at 3 to set up for dinner at 4. I didn't know this, and we drove all the way from the Strip to try Paradise, so when I was turned down at 3:02pm, I gave them a small teensy tiny bitch fit. But only because I was standing right behind an older gentleman, who they let it at 3:01. If it was ok for him, it better be ok for us. And it was.   They let us in and told us we had 15 mins to grab what we wanted and they were clearing out all the food. It was like Supermarket Sweep for us, we were given the green light, and packed two whole plates per person to make sure we got our fill. We ate and left full, and even with our late arrival, weren't the last ones out.   A decent buffet for the price. They even had cocktail shrimp.",

Price was high ($25) due to it being seafood night (overcooked crab and boiled shrimp). Both of us understand that it is hit and miss on a buffet and we tried a little of everything. Unfortunately, we couldn't find a hit. All the entrees were horrible. The carrot cake and soda were good. It might have been a bad night or my poor taste as we went early (5:15) and still waited 15 minutes and when we left, the line was out the door and through the casino. Maybe others know something I don't. My opinion, try somewhere else.",

It was my daughters birthday so I wanted her to get the most out of her dinner. Since she is Vegan I knew this place definitely would have something to offer. Not only was I right I was amazed at the large selection.   We also had the best server ever. He surprised my daughter with cake and a candle and almost everyone in there help to sing happy birthday. It was amazing.... Her best part of the experience was all the different types of desserts    The food was great!!! I had the Oxtails.... I must say that they were not cooked long enough and were a little tough. Everything else was so good we went back the next morning for breakfast .  My daughter specifically wanted to return here for breakfast because she wanted more desserts since she doesn't eat eggs, meat, dairy, chicken etc. Unfortunately, breakfast had a very limited selection  ... They didn't even have an adequate fruit or pastry bar  ... Money waisted   Keep this in mind as well... When we eat there, we noticed very dirty, smelly, patrons there. On observation it looked as if these people were homeless.  Even their hair and handed were dirty looking.  We we so turned off by this .... I couldn't understand how they would let people in the door Smelling that bad. I'm not saying these people should be allowed to eat but the smell was so bad and so strong we requested a table far away.   Anyway, I realized eating at buffets is always a gamble so keep that in mind  Yes we would eat here again ....",

If you want alcoholic beverages with your dinner they do not serve them, you have to leave the restaurant to purchase them and you can bring them back in with you. We were very disappointed.

    "text": "Surprisingly, I haven't heard much about the oxtail soup here. Not until a friend from Hawai'i who was in town said she heard this is THE place to get the best oxtail soup in Vegas. We'll see. Btw... when rating oxtail soup, I'm spoiled with homemade Jamaican Oxtail Stew. Stew over soup all the way.   Okay, before I get into the oxtail, come here for the cafe NOT the buffet.   The buffet is gross and it has limited selection. PLUS, the cafe line is shorter. If you're looking for a buffet in DTLV go to Main Street. If Main Street has a long line (usually Fridays for crab legs, get there before they open, if i'm not mistaken dinner opens at 4pm) If the line is long there, go check out the DTLV restaurants outside of the casino area. New and delish spots opening up. :-) They're walking distance.   TIP: Usually there's a line and wait at The Cal's cafe (Market Street Cafe), so come here if you want Oxtail soup.   The oxtail soup bowl - Comparing to The Cal's... Paradise Cafe's has a larger serving for a regular size, the photo doesn't do it justice! More oxtail, more vegetables, nuts (nice touch), more cilantro and green onions. It comes with a side of ginger and two scoops of rice. In some ways it is better. Larger portions.   Oxtail is good during cooler months, but when it's warm out...the sandwiches & local food are the way to go. Reuben was packed with corned beef but it needed more sauerkraut & sauce. Comes with salt & pepper fries. Flavor and quality is not like the deli but it's decent. For Hawai'ian cafes that serve Reuben's I still prefer The Cal's.   2017 Yelp Challenge Review #3",

What a pleasant surprise to see a marvel of a place run like clockwork with an efficiency second to none.  The food lines were well marked, a special section for salads, desserts, even a hotdog and hamburger Station. Choices were plenty including Americana, Chinese, Italian, and a carving station that was attended at all times.  Our choices included heaping plates of fresh salads, a helping of pasta topped with the mushroom chicken, plenty of pasties and fresh fruits and even an ice cream for dessert.  Good service from waitstaff keeping the ice tea filled.  A clean and fulfilling experience at the Paradise Buffet.  We would definitely make this a go to luncheon place the next time.",

They also over charge for a buffet that had absolutely no sea food, only shrimp. And there were hardly any waitresses to help get your drinks. Of course the ice cream machine was down and the food was not flavorful at all. It was a pretty gruesome experience.",

Whether it be the salad station or anything else. The peel and eat shrimp was good. I didnt have crab legs but they were split in half and looked kind of small.   Roast beef was delicious and have no complaints. Between this or Golden Nugget from what i read about their buffet i would save a few bucks and come here.",

The casino has a lot of advertising that boasts all you can eat prime rib and etc. After paying and getting seated for dinner I saw that prime rib is the only thing people were standing in line for at the service stations - and with GOOD reason.   The bf grabbed some sushi which I was too scared to try. I touched the rice with my finger and it was a sticky, rubber like consistency - a sign of bad rice. I didn't even want to try that.   I grabbed some mashed potatoes, prime rib, sweet yams with marshmallow and bean soup. Everything except for the prime rib has the consistency of mush as it had been sitting on the hot plate for a long time. The bean soup tasted really terrible and left an aftertaste in my mouth.   The prime rib was the only attraction here as the meat was juicy and decent for the price paid for the buffet. People were like vultures waiting for the prime rib and I had two people cut in front of me as we were waiting for it to come out of the oven. It's obvious that people come here to eat plates and plates of this meat.   Save up some money and pay for a better buffet elsewhere.",

It's  a little sad and reminds of a time when the South Pacific was more trendy than it is now.  The buffet is smaller than the one at the Main Street Station and not as nice as the Golden Nugget buffet.  The food was fine but there wasn't a large variety.  The dessert was actually good.  The atmosphere was dark and gloomy.  The servers seemed worn and tired.  My server complained that after his 8 years of working there, they changed from Coke to Pepsi and now he's all confused.  This isn't a buffet like those on the Strip, but it's pretty inexpensive so not a bad investment.",

It's under $10 with tax, server (for drinks) was friendly, and the food was pretty decent.  Started off with a huge salad which is kind of hard to mess up. Onto the entrees, the food seemed fresh and was kept nice and hot. Loved the teryaki chicken with white rice and steamed pork buns (although the paper on the pork buns stuck to the bottom so that was a bit of a challenge). Waffle fries were good and crispy but not that hot. Soft service ice cream for dessert with all the sundae fixings was also yummy!",

Additionally, there were some creative additions that I had never eaten before - such Mexican pot pie and crawfish salad (very good if you like something with an after kick). The staff was very friendly and attentive. All in all, a great value for the budget-conscious tourist who appreciates the vintage aesthetic of Old Vegas.",

Everything tasted old, the sushi was a roll of rice and the prime rib was not even worth going back for seconds.  Should of spent a little more and went somewhere else.  Also service was horrible.  My water cup spent more time empty and plates were not picked up in a timely matter.",

My boyfriend and I visited here after seeing the special on the outside signage: \"steak, shrimp, salad, beverage and dessert for $12.99\". We were trying to do a budget trip, so figured this wouldn't be bad for us. By the time we got in there (3:30pm), the salad bar wasn't ready, so we had to wait until 4pm. At that time, we figured we should get the buffet since it was only $5 more. I went back in line and waited about 15-20 minutes. Then we began to eat! The All American section was mashed potatoes and baked potatoes, the roast beef was so dry--it literally resembled a piece of leather, the dessert was tasteless. Literally, had NO flavor. The prime rib was actually pretty good. But, I had a bite or two of the other food and did not touch it again.  Needless to say, we both left hungry and unsatisfied with upset stomachs. Best bet is to get a nice dinner somewhere else. Skip the buffet.",

Therefore the high rating only applies to the salad bar, seafood chowder, clam chowder, prime rib, fried shrimp and soft serve as that is all I really tried. The prime rib but it was a bit overcooked for my taste but it wasn't dry.  The seafood chowder was surprisingly good, flavorful and chocked full of seafood and I would return just for that.  The atmosphere reminded me of the Peppmermill with all the artificial flowers and it's definitely old Vegas as far as decor but at $11 for lunch it's a great deal if you're downtown.",

(Think of any buffet you'd get at home: pizza, imitation Chinese, etc)  But the service was excellent and it was super cheap. So don't come expecting 5 stars and you're good to go!

Those days are long gone. Now, Vegas has turned into this expensive culinary experiences that will cost you in the range of $35.00 to $45.00 per person at hotels like Paris, Trump, etc. There is a restaurant where the hamburgers are $75.00 each. What?!   Anyway, this no-frill buffet offers a variety of dishes for a relatively cheap price. I believe we paid $15.00 per person for dinner on the weekend. The wait was about 25 minutes which was not bad as compared to the likes of the Buffet at the Rio. The food is nothing special with your typical pasta, pizza, dry roast beef, water-filled ham, plenty of desserts, etc.   This is a great place if you just want to fill your tummy so you can gamble downtown.",

We were seated right away and then they wheeled me to the trough. JK- but I did go up and see what awaited. I tried almost everything, and really the selection was really open. I had cold cuts and cheese, I did try the sushi and I was surprised to like it as much as I did. I don't know if it was made on site or not but it tasted fresh so I did get that a few times. I did not like the prime rib, nor did my mom. It lacked flavor and was tough. The roast beef was great, there was breaded chicken that was good and really everything else was good. I am blanking on what else I ate but I know I had mashed potatoes, gravy, rice, a creamy chicken breast. I would eat here again for sure, I will say if the dessert you are choosing looks like plastic, it probably tastes like plastic. I think the area they need to improve on is the \"pie\" that is being offered.  There was a caramel pecan bar that was amazing I ate like 4 of them (what happens in Vegas...)",

If you have a players card the buffet is $2.00 cheaper but, we were hungry so, we didn't want to go through getting the cards.  The ladies at the entrance were older and friendly and sort of matched this place which is definitely old Vegas complete with the overly floral design throughout the dining area.  Our server was quick to remove dirty plates and refill our drinks.  Friday night is their seafood buffet so we were extremely excited about that.  There were extreme highs and lows in food quality on the buffet.  Food to eat:  Roast beef and creamy horseradish sauce (be careful it's spicy), hot crab legs and drawn butter, mashed potatoes with gravy, fried rice, oysters, peel and eat shrimp with cocktail sauce and fried chicken.  Food I would pass on: Shrimp au gratin (definitely frozen shrimp), pasta, salad bar (everything was old and wilted), sushi (warm and flavorless), tacos (no just no), cold crab legs (not sure why they were serving some cold) and about half of the desserts that could possible be frozen and defrosted before being put out.  It's not a high end buffet and you can probably guess that from the $24ish dollar price per person but, if you come for the crab legs and are looking for a place to eat immediately it's a solid choice.",

    "text": "We were debating between grabbing a bagel in our hotel lobby or finding a place on Fremont Street for breakfast. We had a reservation for the Neon Museum tour and I didn't want to be late.  Let me start by saying that we ate here for breakfast on our first wedding anniversary, circa 1997. I discovered this cherry pastry that I thought about for years afterwards.  Yes, that was 18 years ago but there's a chance it might still be on the menu...right?  We saw a big sign from the freeway that said Free Parking, so we made our way to the outdoor lot. It turns out that you have to pay $3 but you can get validation and a refund at one of the many downtown casinos. The trick is to hang on to all the receipts & slips of paper the attendant hands to you. Keep it handy. We made our way inside the Fremont Casino and saw a sign that club members receive special pricing. Considering the fact that signing up for the card is free, why not? When the cashier handed my husband his new card, she instructed him to stick it in the machine and spin the wheel for a prize.  Guess what he won? Buy one, get one  1/2 off of a buffet. Eating breakfast here seemed to be our destiny. It's tough to pass up $11 for a buffet for 2.   It was mid-week in October and we were seated right away. Our beverage waitress was very attentive and kept our coffee and waters full. That's where the stars stop for me. The mediocre sausage was cold. The pancakes and eggs tasted like they had been sitting awhile. There was a station where you could order an omelet but it had a pretty good line and I wanted to get on our way. If you find yourself here, that is definitely the way to go.  I avoided the canned fruit cocktail and selected a few pieces of fresh melon. The honeydew was fresh and tasty the cantaloupe was rock hard.  Remember the magical little cherry pastry I dreamed about for 18 years? Gone, replaced by lackluster little dry cinnamon swirls and puff pastries with more air than flavor. I was so sad.  We were told to go back to the cashier to get our parking validated. Remember when I told you to hang on to all the paperwork in the lot? This is where you will need it. We had to search for a good 10 minutes before we found the particular receipt they required to reimburse us the $3.",

I did enjoy the hot crab legs (although they were kind of small). I just grabbed  bunch, took out all they meat, squeezed lemon on top with a bit of salt, and into the butter it went. Yummy! I also had the roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy. That was pretty tasty!  The servers were very attentive, kept my drink full and my table clean.",

    "text": "Instead of LUNCH, I hit this buffet up for dinner mainly because they offered sushi.  The decor is dark wt mirrored walls but nice enough with big plush comfortable booths wt strong direct lighting on the table good for reading a paper.  I hit up the sushi bar first and the rolls are large cuts and limited to cali, tuna & some mystery roll (?) the wasabi was dry and had very little kick at all. I accompanied the rolls wt peel & eat garlic shrimp that had been cooked then iced down and it had a mushy texture wasnt very nice at all. The crab salad was tasty enough and helped make the roll a little better. Overall a big disappointment.  Next up was the Mexican station and I made a plate of \"Super Nachos\" wt a bed of crispy chips wt a hearty spoonful of pulled pork, ground beef and pulled chicken in a tomato sauce & added guacamole, some refried beans, mexican rice and sour cream. I ended up  adding some much needed salt & mixing it all up and it was better tasting than when I was picking at the individual sections. This was better than the limited & lame sushi station. I had also got a pc of fried chicken and it turned out to be on the cold side and I stopped eating it.  Next up was the chinese station  offering 3 or so dishes of Beef Brocoli, chicken in some sauce wt thick cut onions & peppers. I tried both combining them and it was OK. There was some Lo mein and Chines noodles I passed on and NO spring rolls.  Last up was desert and the selections seemed many and looked quite good. I tried the Coconut cream pia wt some soft serve ice cream and it was good enough to have 2 pcs. There was more cream than coconut filling but at least the crust was good.  This was kind of pricey coming in at around $17 and not really worth it at considered the lacking quality and offerings. I might add that this night I went was \"Prime Rib\" night and while I didnt try any, it looked OK.  I doubt I will be going back if I'm in the area and will stick wt the Golden Nugget over The Freemont as the quality was in line wt the price.",

    "text": "My wife, Aunt, and I decided to try out the Paradise buffet in the Fremont Casino.  It was seafood night.  Fortunately enough, my aunt went there first and waited in line.  By the time we walked in, she had already gotten us the table.  As you walk into the Buffet, the lighting is a bit dim and dark.  However, you can see and navigate.  The atmosphere is laid out like a safari or jungle.  Imagine the RainForest restaurant with no animals.  Unless, you think the large buffet people are hippos, elephants, or tigers grazing on the buffets...hee hee...  The wait staff was not that great.  For some reason, it looked like the casino has cut back on staff.  As a result, the service was a bit too slow for my taste.  Also, some of the utensils (i.e. crab breakers/nut crackers) were not available.  Need to stock up people!  As for the food, I headed straight to the king crab claws and was sorely disappointed, they were a bit frail and thin.  boo hoo... shrimp was okay... and I don't want to really talk about the oysters.  Let's say this, one look at the oysters and I had to sadly walk away.  It was puny and a bit too old for me.    On the flip side, they had a great pasta layout.  But, it was the various \"creole\" sauce that stood out for me.  They had a clam sauce, a shrimp etoufee creole sauce, and another light creole flavor sauce.  It was pretty good.  The salad bar was okay.  However, the desserts and the fruits were very sweet and good.  Overall, the price per person is about $18 on seafood night.  If it was not for the creole sauce, this place would have received a lower rating... honestly, Asia buffet is still hands down my favorite...   Cheers",

The mexican meat pie is pretty gross.  The crab claws and peel and eat shrimp could be better quality.  I tried the lox last time and coudn't swallow one bite.  With that being said, the local options of rice, corned beef hash and portuguese sausage are great.  The korean chicken is good.  My mom loved the fried chicken.  There is a nice blend of American and island options.  Overall not bad for the price.  If you are from the islands or receive specials from the hotel (or the chain) you get good discounts and coupons... which is why we are regulars here.",

First let me start with the fact that the entrance to buffet is also right next to the entrances for the bathrooms. Lovely smell there. The hostess was nice. The server...well she pretty much ignored us until I actually had to flag her down to re-fill our water. The food...you get what you pay for. The \"seafood\" that was on all the signs consisted of just shrimp. I could not find these Crab Legs everyone is talking about. Also the shrimp was DIRTY!!! Like DIrty!!! Like they hadn't been de-vained right. My boyfriend and I decided to stick to the fried foods just to be safe. I mean....it pretty much reminded me of like a Hometown Buffet or something. Not what you would except to find in Vegas. We tried it. We didn't like it. We won't be back.",

The only decent food I liked was the candied yams- very sweet but good.  Everything else....was meh.  Not the biggest buffet I've seen (what a total lie) & certainly not the best.  The buffet bar was small- not alot of selection in my opinion.  They have mirrors all around to make the place look bigger.

    "text": "Quite disapppointed of this one. The signs had all these advertisements saying that there were 8 stations of all kinds of food at this buffet. The pictures on the advertising screens show images of steak, lobster, roast beef, salad, etc.   So you're thinking that you're going to get what you're paying for. Well after paying and being seated, I walk up to the buffet and there were maybe 2 or 3 stations PARTIALLY open. The breakfast area was sad, didn't even have oatmeal or grits. But the weird thing is that it had rice next to the eggs, bacon, and other regular breakfast food. Who eats rice for breakfast???  In any case, I waited to see if the lunch thing would be any better since we came in at 10:30 (and I did pay for the full lunch price). Lunch was no better, with maybe 1 more station opened.   The cheese and whip cream and other dairy products were clearly the cheap immitation kind that taste like a combination of cardboard and plastic.   They had the food out on the bar, but then put signs up saying section closed. I had already gotten permission to eat the lunch items from the manager at the front, so when I went to get some of the roast chicken, the woman behind the bar screams at me to put it back and that the section isn't open. But she just let my friend take food from the same area. She was screaming at me to give back the chicken, I told her that she cannot put it back on the bar as it's against health code, she told me that she will take it in the back and for me to give the chicken back. I simply walked away to my table and waited for her to come out as I surely would have called the manager on her. Lucky for her she let it go.  I think a lot of the places in Fremont Street use False advertising to get people inside and spend their $, including the restaurants, bars and casinos.   I came away with a 2day tooth ache from having eaten 2 slices of their blueberry pie with the imitation whip cream. I always get toothaches from the synthetic immitation dairy products, like whip creams.  There was really nothing on that entire buffet that I would have eaten out of my own and had I known what this buffet was about, I would have chosen to eat elsewhere. I only ate something as I didn't want to waste my money and make a big fuss as I had friends who wanted to enjoy their buffet. So for them I just ate something to keep good vibes for them.  But seriously, I'm not happy with my experience here.",

    "text": "Steak Night is worth four stars but their Prime Rib ditto was a letdown with a way more limited selection of dishes despite the same price. This variation is why I rate it three stars.  Their Steak Night is good; I like their steak station, which is good with a decent \"buffet quality\" piece of meat (ergo - don't expect steak house quality....), which I consider a bit better than the Medley Buffet at  Orleans.   This buffet is relatively small so the overall selection is less than at some bigger establishments but I must admit that I think the dinner price/quality ratio is better than some of the Strip properties (a \"Gourmet Dinner\" at Bellagio isn't 2.5 times better) if coming here when they do their Steak Night. There are areas where cost-cutting is evident such as the lack of good cheese (they offer some tired processed Cheddar) and salad selections but the traditional hot food stations are OK and I think the whole experience is satisfying.   The environment has a very nostalgic vibe taken direct out of the 80s, which I like. A major benefit is that the acoustics is good; the restaurant is pretty quiet, which is a welcome difference from some other buffets, which can be very noise due to their design.   The buffet area is small so some crowding can occur but the stations have a decent spacing between them, thus avoiding collisions between different service lines.   I would recommend to come here when it is Steak Night; their Seafood Fantasy is pretty OK but for that amount of money I would rather look into other options.",

    "text": "I would have given 3 1/2 stars if I could only for the overall quality of the food offerings.  We ended up here on Tuesday night for seafood night.  It's a bit pricey, $27.99 for 1 person, but there really is a lot to choose from.  Let me just bullet point it here:  1) sushi should have been set it with fewer pieces so the rice wouldn't be as dried out as it was.  2) salad bar seemed fresh enough but I didn't even bother with that...had to leave room for everything else   3) cold bar had oysters, crab, peel and eat shrimp, and a few other items I wasn't sure about. The shrimp were good even though I had to peel them.  4) hot bar was another story. Pasta (didn't have any), ribs (pretty tasty and adequate meat), crab (yummy but it would have been nice if they were at least pre cracked or crab crackers were available, I ended up using a fork), breaded shrimp (ok, nothing spectacular), breaded clams (I was really looking forward to these but I was disappointed, they were rubbery), corn was good and the seafood bisque soup was probably the best part of the meal!  5) dessert options were plentiful but the couple that we tried were a bit dried out, but still tasty.  I guess I'm not a real buffet person so I'm not the best judge (seems to be too much money for the little food I take) but as buffets go this one was good.  Our waitress was friendly and filled out drinks in a timely manner.",

However, the host staff is horrendous. Seriously. They weren't there so we went to go sit down on our own as instructed and the host seriously screamed at us demanding we wait to be sat. He has no sense of personal service.   I'm currently writing this review inside the paradise buffet and beginning to feel sick. We paid $22 for a buffet for two. While yes, this is relatively cheap compared to the better buffets on the strip, it's still A major rip off. We both ate one plate and left them completely full. Everything tastes straight out of the '90's and this isn't a taste too many people want. I know I don't. The recipes were bland and the kitchen staff were rude and not appreciative for the business    The decor in this place is awful as well. Bland and dark. Just like their food. I highly recommend you keep your $22 and save yourself stomach sickness and the chance to renter the '90's.",

Forget about going to the Californian. I mean, really, oxtail soup does not have celery and carrots and peas.   This is the authentic oxtail soup where the meat falls off the bone. Generous sized pieces with boiled peanuts, water chestnut, mushroom, chinese parsely (cilantro) and a side of grated ginger and two scoops of rice. My only complaint is that the water chestnut pieces are large, rather than using slices. The broth is flavorful and to top it off, it's inexpensive compared to the other local food establishments at other Sam Boyd casinos.  Definitely worth a visit. Just bypass the buffet line as ask for the cafe seating.",

An old electronic board hangs above one of the tables and displays todays date as of january 14 1998. The board is however sadly not the only thing that's stuck in the 90's. The restaurant's interior screams tacky early 90's design, perfectly in harmony with the staff's hideous flower patterned shirts and dresses. How the owner hasn't thought of making a design change here is something I will never fully understand.  But the main part here is of course the food. I can honestly say that this is the worst buffet I've ever been to and I've been to plenty. Went there for prime rib night and was or course looking forward to trying their advertised prime rib. It was extremely blend and reminded me of the crappy pieces of meat I used to get for school lunch in first grade. The lasagna, macaroni salad, crab salad and even the desserts all tasted like last week's leftovers. Even the bread was stale and terrible.   Also, as a nice surprise afterwards, I'm pretty sure I got food poisoned from the buffet. It ruined the whole evening afterwards and I'm not surprised now when I see that other fellow Yelpers have been food poisoned from there as well.   When I left the place, I wanted to stand outside and warn people from going in there. My girlfriend literally had to stop me from doing so by dragging me away.   So please, whatever you do, avoid this place at all cost. It's not worth ruining an evening or your whole trip because of the restaurant's cheap prices. This place feels like a crappy buffet on a cruise ship and will make you feel sea sick without even being on a ship.",

If this is the biggest and the best I would truly hate to see the others.  We were here on \"steak night.\"  Price was $14.99/person.  I think you get a $1 discount if you have a players card for the casino.  I should probably preface this review by saying we ate at Bacchanal a couple days prior to eating here at the Paradise buffet.  I knew we would not get the same quality of food as at Bacchanal, but good lord... The salad bar was kind of gross.  Their \"fresh meats and cheeses\" section was packaged lunch meat and Kraft singles (probably generic, not even Kraft).  I am not kidding.  The hot food section was... limited.  I think there were maybe 10 food choices total with a meat carving section in the center.  One of the meats available was ham.  They had a maybe 2\" thick end piece of a ham sitting there that was dry and crusty.  They never replaced it the whole time we were there (which, granted, was not long) and it never got smaller, which means no one else was foolish enough to ask for any either.  Being that it was steak night we expected to see steaks.  Well, there were some very thin cuts of steak being grilled.  They ask how you want yours cooked but there's really no point - the meat is so thin they're all well done.  As far as the other hot food went, the only 2 things I actually enjoyed were a baked potato and a fried chicken leg, neither of which was worth $14.99.  They had a porkchop dish that was downright disgusting.  I did find a basket of nacho chips and a pot of scalding hot cheese sauce.  These were edible and I did like the fact that the chips were thick.  I saw some sushi but didn't get anywhere near it.  Dessert... only the sugar free items were labeled so we took a couple of things back to our table to try (hoping to figure out what they were).  We tried two different pies that had absolutely no flavor, a piece of chocolate cake that was kinda rubbery, and a slice of cheesecake that my husband deemed \"ok.\"  We left the desserts on the plates with small bites out of them.  As I was walking through the restaurant I noticed several other tables with plates of desserts on them that looked exactly like ours.  The service was just ok - we had to wait a while for someone to come take our drink order but our plates were always cleared promptly.  Bottom line, pay more for a better buffet on the strip.  I wouldn't come back here, even if it was free.",

But it was a lot better than some of the reviews before had suggested.",

I showed up a little after 9pm when the deal starts, but the line was way too long.  In the back of the casino, I saw Paradise Buffet, which was only $15. (with a players club card) and included New York steak on Saturday nights.  After paying my $15. (which surprisingly included a drink), I was seated and went to make my plate.  I was impressed by the cold cuts spread and the hot roast beef which was being carved.  The New York was another story though. I ordered mine medium rare, but it ended up being way overcooked and very tough. The guy grilling them either misheard me, or he needs to find a new line of work.  The price wasn't bad, but the steak was a huge disappointment. I had some tortilla chips too that were old and stale. The desserts did not look good at all, so I didn't even try any. I can't recommend this place at all. Spend a couple more dollars and go to a good buffet.",

When we arrived, we walked right up to the cashier.  Lucky us!   First off, my hubby is stoked that there was seafood everywhere!  Crab for breakfast?  If you insist.  Plus all the regular fixins.  Plus they had some lunch/dinner items out as well.  The fried chicken looked good, but I did not try it since I wanted breakfast food and I don't do chicken for breakfast! Everything was good.  The yams sounded good, but were a mistake.  They were not cut right, I ended up with an end piece still on the yam.  But other than that they tasted pretty good.  Waitress was very attentive.  Our glasses were never empty.   If you are not looking for gourmet type faire and are not wanting to spend a fortune,  come here.  If you want a fancy atmosphere with extravagant names for your food, then go to a buffet on the strip.   This place fills you up for cheap.  Go and sign up for the Byods card.  You get discounts at the buffet here and at the other Byod casinos in Vegas.",

One of those where you're genuinely concerned about what the aftermath will be. The only saving grace is that I didn't turn up with food poisoning.  I don't get how this place got so many good reviews. I would definitely not recommend going on seafood night - it's more expensive and the selection is a joke. I could probably list on 2 hands the variety of items offered.  The sushi was not sushi. It was a shitload of rice surrounding unidentifiable gray stuff. That's not an exagerration for comedic purposes.  The peel & eat shrimp were small and flavorless. The shrimp with shells on were seasoned and actually really tasty but messy. The crab legs were typical buffet crab legs.  Aside from the seafood, they had mushy spaghetti, cold bread, old veggies and some very unattractive looking meat specimens.  The desserts were a joke.  Pay the extra money and head to the Bellagio buffet. This place was sickening.",

And all the deserts are soggy or bland. They made sushi with American white rice and 'steak night' was overcooked frozen strip steak.

The buffet area is decorated like tropical rain forest, though a bit dark. Crowded in the late morning. Food was not bad but not that impressive either. The waiter was okay but kind of slow for my table (just myself, so didn't get his attention too much). I liked the sausage they have. It reminded me of my childhood. If you want to experience Fremont, this place is a choice. After brunch, I played slot machine at their casino. I was lucky enough to get my money back :)",

Cons: The room is weird, why are the buffet and cafe attached? There really isn't ever a whole lot going on. Very average, traditional American food. I would have at least expected some Hawaiian offerings seeing how popular the place is with Hawaiians.  I would only recommend this buffet if you had an insatiable taste for something overwhelmingly average. If not, you can do much better.",

    "text": "UPDATE 2013 This place is still great and has become a Las Vegas tradition for my friends and I. We stop here every time our trip coincides with one of the seafood nights (Tuesday and Friday). The soup of the day rotates and it is always a special treat when it is the clam chowder. The cold seafood continues to be the highlight of this buffet although the hot foods have gotten slightly better (although not enough yet to make this a 5 star buffet even at the very affordable price). We have turned many of our friends onto this place and the 11pm closing time is great for our friends that drive in from Southern California after work on Fridays. On our last trip, the crab legs were no longer split. I prefer them split as it makes them easier to eat, but I know others feel unsplit crab legs retain their taste better. The biggest surprise was that they now have added snow crab claws. They were delicious despite being a little hard to eat (although once you learn the trick they're easier to eat than snow crab legs even with the harder shell). _______________________________________________________________  This was the surprise of my last trip. I really wasn't expecting much since you never really hear about any downtown buffets outside of the one at the Fremont's sister property: Main Street Station. Well, we were hungry and the seafood fantasy night sounded good so we decided to give it a shot.   The room it is served in might be described as tacky by some, but I really like it. It has that old school feel. This is actually where Trent and Mikey ended up eating after losing all their money in Swingers. That movie does not come close to capturing the feel of this room. Plus the service was pretty good.   The main draws of seafood fantasy night are the snow crab legs (split for easier eating), oysters, and peel and eat shrimp. The crab was pretty good. The shrimp tasted good too, but they were seasoned and I would have preferred them unseasoned. The oysters were awesome. I ate about a dozen and my friend had 2 dozen. I'm sure others in the buffet had more. These oysters were small, but tasted good and fresh. They were as good as any other oysters I've ever had; just smaller. I usually am weary of buffet oysters, even the Rio's famous seafood buffet has terrible oysters, but these were good. They also have a small sushi section which was pretty basic shrimp nigiri and California roll variations. I'm surprised they didn't have more variety. They also have a clam chowder that no one notices because they put it next to the honeydew melon. I had actually finished eating and wanted to get a few pieces of melon for dessert when I noticed it and got a bowl. The chowder is very good. My friend said it was the best thing at the buffet. He ended up skipping dessert and eating another bowl of the chowder. Actually, instead of using the little chowder bowls, he grabbed an ice cream sundae bowl from the dessert station and got himself a huge bowl of clam chowder.  The other items in the buffet are also mostly seafood. Nothing really stood out except for the trout which was very good. Some of the items were a little on the dry side such as the lasagna that had almost no ricotta and the seafood enchiladas. I would have preferred it if they kept more of their regular dishes instead of doing so many seafood dishes on seafood fantasy night. I like a little turf with my surf and the only items that weren't seafood, bread, or vegetables were the meats at the carving station and the fried chicken.  All in all, I was really impressed by the quality and price.",

We were just so totally full of everything you can imagine, from crab legs to California \"sushi\" rolls.   And god there were some pigs in there.   I watched one dude literally take the entire plate of sushi rolls (like about 30 pieces) and I was thinking like \"Dude, WTF!\"    Hahah!     I hope he ate all of that.   I did keep watching him and he was making very good progress.   At least he BETTER have eaten all of it after making everyone else wait for more.     I accidentally hit some lady in the head with a flying crab leg.  When I was cracking it, the thing slipped out of my hand, flew clean over the next table and hit some lady right in the noggin.   That was so embarrassing and while I am sure the people had to have noticed, they were polite and acted like nothing happened.    So what happens next?   My brother does the same thing, flying crab leg right into a mans lap at the table next to us.   That one did spurn a dirty look.   We are not normally that sloppy, we were just having an off day.   :)    You can expect a line here, our wait was about 20 minute yet very well worth it.",

I visit it sometimes when I'm in town, but other than that, out of sight, out of mind. It's like that certain friend you sometimes feel obligated to hang out with just because you're \"friends.\"    Food was nothing spectacular. It was the usual buffet-type food, a little of this, a little of that. I love raw oysters, but the oysters here were just okay. They were still attached to the shells so I had to rip them off with a fork. The crab legs were good though.   The decor was interesting. It was somewhat dark, but also quite cozy. The servers were great. They were always coming by, taking away plates and handing out more napkins.   Okay food, good prices, good service.  Oh Paradise Buffet, I really did wished our friendship could become something more, but it can't. It's not you, it's me. I just deserve something better. I hope you'll understand.",

No hello, hi, please, thank you, or you're welcomes from the lady Shirley. I felt like I was in a cattle herd waiting in the line and getting my way to the front. Lucky for me I had great company so I put up with it. We got seated and went up to the buffet. This was the smallest buffet selection I have ever seen. (which I guess could be good because the food was awful.) I took a little bit of the buttered noodles which were so hard and crispy. nothing like a flimsy noodle should be. The beef in the asian dishes was extra chewy. I sampled some of the taco meat, mexican rice, and beans mixed all together on my plate and got a piece of plastic in my mouth. yes, you read right. PLASTIC in my food. I was instantly turned off from anything else. In order to please my party I ate a slice of pineapple, some cottage cheese, and the wimpy salad bar. As for dessert in the ice cream section they give you warm bowls. it melted my poor vanilla ice cream into soup. This place just left me disgusted and sick to my stomach. That is hard to do but they sure did it. Thanks paradise buffet. I will not be returning and you can keep your plastic with your rude employee's.",

    "text": "Went there on the Sunday  \"seafood\" buffet. Great price for a \"seafood\" buffet. But what exactly makes a buffet a \"seafood\" buffet??? The Rio hotel has a \"seafood\" buffet which is about twice the cost of this buffet... But for a good reason - it has hot and cold crab, lobster, fresh juicy oysters, sushi, sashimi, and the list goes on...  The Paradise \"Seafood\" Buffet is nothing more than a standard buffet with fresh oysters and about 3 kinds of sushi added to the menu! It is pretty standard for most buffets to include shrimp and crab legs in their dinner menus. So I suppose if you add some oysters and some sushi in your menu, you're magically upgraded to \"Seafood\" Buffet!  Whoever was in charge of the oysters when I went, didn't rinse them so there was a ton of barnicle pieces and black oyster shell goo all over the place. To makes matters worse, they also stacked the oysters all on top of each other, so you'd be sure to taste some of that crunchy shell pieces and goo. Yumm? The oysters themselves were quite good, but the poor preparation lead me to only eat less than a handfull of them. In comparison, I think I ate about two dozen juicy ones at the Rio. As for the sushi... I think it was just a california roll, a shrimp nigiri, and tuna roll.   So if you're a seafood aficionado, then be ready to be disappointed. If you're a regular buffet eater... Not bad!",

Of course, you will not be getting the gourmet food that is at the Wynn or the Bellagio, but for $11.99, this buffet is seriously not bad.  They even have a seafood section with crab legs!!!  We came here for Sunday Brunch and so there was breakfast and lunch foods.  I like this place because you can either order off the cafe menu if you don't feel like buffet, OR you can get buffet.  Most of our group went with the buffet but I ordered off the menu.    I can still rate the buffet though, because I pretty much ordered my BF around and ate half of his food. hahaha.  Biscuits & gravy...YUM....the bacon was YUM...the cornbeef hash was YUMMMM.   I ended up ordering the oxtail soup (where my hawaiians at?) which is SOOOOO good here.  Better than at the other downtown hotels.",

Couldn't get anything down! Went back to the the line and asked for a refund. It took almost as long for the manager to come as it did for me to try to find something to eat in that dump. He gave us a refund without any questions or apologies. While I was waiting for him to come, I was talking with one of the girls that sets the customers. She asked me why I wanted a refund, I told her the food sucks and everything is cold. She said oh, I've never eaten here. Well there you go!",

    "text": "Tropical themed restaurant.  Been here for buffets which were decent.  Wanting to avoid the long buffet line, we opted to be seated for the cafe.  Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we waited....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren't shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he'd be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.    We waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.   A minute later, our huffy server shows up with no greeting and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.   Again,  another long wait.  I looked at my watch and noticed it's been over 20 minutes with NO DRINKS!  This has been my worst experience at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance.  About another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No apology or explanation about the delay.   Then our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had True Korean marinated ribs.   We noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE.... While we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he's going on a break and that \"so and so\" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we're introduced to the new server. Anyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.    The new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I've experienced in the past were decent.  At the rate we were going, we could have just waited for the buffet...it may have been faster!",

The salad bar has about 10 choices for veggies, imitation bacon bits, and only a few choices for dressing.  Friday night was cooked to order steak night and the steak was cooked perfectly (I think the steak chef was Kevin... Nice work) and whatever cut that was passed because of the seasonings and I assume meat tenderizer applied well in advance.  Fried chicken was tasty, baked potato bar had the same imitation bits, and the asian ribs were ok.  You get more than what you pay for, but that's not saying much compared to some of the other places in town.  If you are downtown and hungry, you won't leave unhappy, but you won't be wowed either.",

This is when Las Vegas still had relatively cheap buffets all over the strip and was not quite so expensive to visit.    Well, looks like this place still has a relatively cheap buffet.  I was actually not of drinking age when I came that time and it was the first time I had Cherries Jubilee, which I loved.   And many of their other brunch buffet selection was great.

They were pre-cracked so the server said they didn't have crackers :/ The champagne was good. Probably not fancy stuff but good. The servers never let my glass(plastic) be less than half full. Even if you drink one fourth they will top it off! Over all, I enjoyed everything I put on my plate except for some kind of white fish steak(too fishy).",

It has all the stuff you'd expect of a downtown Vegas buffet including shrimp cocktail, smoked salmon, snow crab legs, half shell oysters, prime rib, etc etc etc.. (prime rib was overcooked and tough so make sure you look at the color and how many strokes it takes the carver to cut your slice).  Good salad bar.  Desserts are okay.  Food taste and quality is definitely 3 stars but overall it is a good deal and has lots of selections.  In my opinion having fancy seafood is not an indication of culinary skill, though it is a must have for a buffet of this caliber.  (It isn't hard to thaw a couple cases of precooked split crab legs or to blanch and shock a couple hundred pounds of shrimp in a steam kettle for shrimp cocktail.)    Ambiance is festive and fun, but verges on tacky with its plastic flower tropical theme.  Its a turn and burn buffet so don't expect much service so i'm not going to even rate that aspect here.  If you're hungry on a Friday night and happen to be checking the FSE out, definitely stop by and try it out!",

First, we were able to get a discount because we had coupons and ended up getting the specialty buffet for $10 - for that price you can't go wrong with filling up on food. However, the taste and selection? Okay at best.   We went on seafood night and had called ahead to make sure they had crab. We originally wanted Joe's Crab Shack, only to find out they closed, ugh. Their Crab selection was abundant but tiny crab. The cold crab was the largest but flavorless - soaking it in hot butter was my solution. They had roast beef but looked so deceivingly like prime rib - they even had horseradish and au jus! But don't be mistaken, it was nowhere near prime rib. They say they have sushi bars, but they have a small sushi section - maybe 3 plates of selection. That is definitely not a sushi bar.   You can order off the menu as well, which we did for my daughter because they said she can't have the buffet  very questionable there but okay. It's very limiting on selection. She had your basic eggs bacon and rice - can't mess that up right? Overcooked scrambled eggs and mushy wet rice, that's just horrendous. She ate bacon and fed her again later, so disappointing.   Service- the cashier at front tried to charge me for 6 buffets when we had 3. No customer service at all, just a rush through and no smile. Working in some form of customer service means a bit of common courtesy - I know very well it's taxing to deal with all types of people, but knowing what you're signing onto and the fact that you want people to come back. Our waitress was pretty attentive most of the time, no complaints there.   If the buffet costed more than $10 I would not return again. Regular price is $25, so without a coupon I would not return. You can find many other buffets with better food. I would not recommend unless you're on a budget and rather spend your money on gambling!",

We went there during the Thanksgiving week, it's so hard to find a place to eat for a family of 6 without super over-charged. The line moved quick and the food was acceptable and still with varieties. If you are on budget, just trying to eat a basic dinner and spend some time enjoying dinner with your family. It will do the job.",

We ate here a couple times - simply because we were gambling all night and got comped a lot. :)  BUT, we found the food to be quite tasty and the champagne made us feel like the high-rollers that we kinda were those nights...  It was a great feeling to cut in front of the line with our vouchers and go right in.    The prime rib was very good, but the ham was amazing.  It was fun to sample a little bit of everything, but it's hard to not keep ringing the prime rib bell when given the chance.  I didn't mess with the desserts much.  The fruit was fresh and had good flavor - something I always worry about with buffets.",

The customer service was pretty good but the food was really bland and mediocre.  Thankfully the buffet didn't cost much compared to other Las Vegas buffets but I was so disappointed in the food.  They have a wide variety to choose from but in all honesty, I only enjoyed one thing: their fried chicken.  Their fried chicken is really tasty and crispy and everything else was just blah-even the dessert!  Cocktail Shrimp - really tiny shrimp Meatloaf - no taste Steak - hard and rubbery Apple Pie - yuck Pumpkin Pie - double yuck Mashed Potatoes - very bland  Well, you get the picture.    If you have a voucher for a free meal at the buffet, get the fried chicken, I don't know what else to tell ya.",

My uncle had to use the restroom, so we walked into the closest casino, which happened to be Fremont! When everyone was done using the restroom, my aunt saw the huge \"Seafood Buffet\" sign right outside of the restrooms, and that is how it began...  It was a Friday night, which meant Seafood. The seafood buffet was $20.99 per person. We were all hungry, so we made the best of it! My friend and I had a strategy... and that strategy was to ONLY EAT SEAFOOD!  The 2 stars for this review definitely goes to the Giant Crawfish! I HEART CRAWFISH! So... GUILTY, I had about 2-3 plates full of crawfish =X. There was also crab legs, which were alright, extremely small. I did enjoy the smoked salmon and fried oysters. The peeled shrimp on the other hand? They were BAD... They looked very dark, I did not even want to try them! The sushi was not good. The rice had seemed to harden from sitting in the open all day. Aside from the seafood, the rest of the food selection was very minimal.  It was then time for dessert. Luckily they had banana cream pie! It wasn't the best, but it was okay.  Overall, nothing too spectacular about this buffet. I don't think I'll be paying another $21 to eat here...",

They had one woman working at the register, and she kept ignoring the giant line to serve the people coming up to the \"preferred\" line.  She didn't smile and was generally unpleasant.  Then came the food.  In a town where there are buffets with literally hundreds of options, this particular place only had maybe 12 different food selections aside from the salad bar.  The roast beef was cold, the crab legs were so thin there were basically no meat in them and the sushi was lower quality than what you would expect to find at a local 7-11.  Just when we thought it couldn't get worse, the service was something just as bad. After waiting for a refill for quite some time, my cousins wife asked a server for a refill and she responded with \"what do you want?\".   Save your money and try anywhere else.",

I was astounded and taken aback when the cashier, Luis, accused me of the booklet not being mine and Fremont did not honor the coupons. I ABSOLUTELY purchased the booklet and it DOES include the Fremont Buffet. Having spoken to others, I also found disgruntled guests of the Fremont. As far as the dining experience, James was great and very attentive. The food was very mediocre and selection very poor.  This is not a destination I would have selected however, a group of ten voted to \"try\" this morning buffet.  Your cashiering staff desperately needs customer service classes!     I also want to add... In today's Internet-driven world, customers have more power than ever. Satisfied customers might share  their good experience with a few friends, whereas an angry customer has the potential to tell thousands  on social media.  And for each customer that complains, there are thousands who don't. They just simply stop doing business with you.   Suggestiol?  Go elsewhere.",

It was a decent buffet and we had no issues with it.    Server was efficient and clear our table of the dirty plates on a timely matter.  Crab Legs were good overall.   I ate a ton of this today.  3 platefuls.  No complaints whatsoever.  But some people might be expecting top tier crab legs or something and be disappointed when they go here......not me.  The crag legs are not cut in half, you do have to work for them.  Got my money's worth and then some.   Dessert selections were decent and my wife liked them.     I got some hot food selections to eat too, not too shabby.   Again, we were happy and satisfied by coming here today.  No complaints.  We've been to the more expensive buffets on the strip which have more selections and choices, but if you were eating crab legs like I do most of the time...then this is a wise spot to go when it's served on Tuesday & Friday Nights.      Otherwise, if you want a huge selections of choices such as street tacos, ethnic foods such as asian foods, large selection of fruits......go to the pricier buffets on the strip.",

This came up on Google search as a good inexpensive buffet but it's a pure lie. The food was terrible beyond words.  Absolutely nothing tasted good or was decently cooked, except the taco station. Everything was either bland or tasted like salt bomb. Most items are over cooked and dry.  I saw a coupe of young guys came in and sat at the table next to us. They looked hungry and could enjoy a few plate worth of food, but they left after a few bites into the first plate!!! On the way out, they complained how terrible the food was.  Skip this place - the food is so terrible it's not excusable for Las Vegas, especially at this crazy high price.",

Monday to Friday, 7am to 10:30am, the breakfast buffet is $9.99 (plus tax), and on weekends, until 3pm, their champagne breakfast (breakfast with unlimited champagne) is $14.99 (plus tax).  The food isn't amazing, but it's good, and at those prices, you really can't complain.  And the coffee was nice and hot.  (I can't stand slightly cooled coffee -- yuck!)  We had the champagne breakfast buffet when we went to Vegas last year*, and their regular breakfast buffet yesterday morning.  I had a very modest amount (really!), but I was full until dinner.    If you're looking for a cheap breakfast, I highly recommend the Paradise Buffet.  It'll fill you up but won't break the bank.  Also, they have WiFi that connects very easily and quickly.  *Addendum: We had their champagne breakfast with relatives the day after our wedding.  Delicious!  [Yelp collections: Vegas 2018]",

As my brother and I booked our plane and rooms through Vacations Hawaii, we received our booklet of meal vouchers (good at the Fremont, the California, Main Street Station) which allowed us to pay a highly discounted amount off the regular price.   Ate 3 dinner buffets during the 5 nights in Vegas (guess it was just so convenient). First night was a unlimited steak night, and the new york steaks (had to play visual cues with the 'chef', who didn't answer my inquiries directly as to what cut of the beef that was being grilled. Had a medium, but really tasted like a medium well. Brother wanted a medium well, but really got a well done piece. We went back for more though.  Decor looks the same since coming first to this place back in the late 1990s. A lot of desserts, along with a whole area of sugar free desserts which made me feel less guilty, along with soft serve ice milk/cream (chocolate, vanilla, or combination).  Yes, some of the foods look like leftovers from a few hours ago, but that's because those were the less frequently eaten.  I must say, their fried chicken was bomb!  They can sell it on its own and they will come! I loved it and ate it all three times I was there.  Korean chicken -no no no...nothing like what Korean chicken would taste like in Hawaii...   On another night (Sunday) was the prime rib buffet, loved it.  What I didn't like was the lack of pride in the restaurant by many servers and hosts...On the second night, think it was a Thursday night just about 8pm, we were seated at the tables to the immediate right upon entering the dining area. A group of people were seated near us and a fried chicken drumstick fell on the ground from their table top ... NO servers/waiters/busboys/ hosts/tray person wanted to pick up the bone off the carpeted floor, which I felt was a liability... I had a clear shot of these workers who practically looked at the bone on the floor as they walked in its path for the entire time I was there (a little over an hour), and no one wanted to pick up that chicken bone. Is it 'beneath them' to do so???  Shame, shame on them !   Geez...our waiter, though nearby talking story with another waiter while assembling napkins, utensils did not come back to refill our coffee  unless he was summoned... so service was not all there like on previous reviews.   However, I now like eating here more than at Main Street Station's Garden Court Buffett, guess the atmosphere was more tropical and suited me, someone from Hawaii...",

    "text": "For the price of a Seafood Buffet, this one can't be beat.  I've been to seafood buffets where to seafood tastes frozen, bland and borderline scary looking.   The seafood had flavor and was good. It didn't taste frozen at all. 2 different types of crabs with 2 ways of preparation, hot or cold. I like hot.   The Dungeness crab was good and came out in big chunks. The thick shell was already pre-cracked for you so it was easy to get the goodness out.  Drawn butter and a little lemon, that's it!   Even with a softer shell, the snow crab was also pre-cracked for you.  The crab was tasty and came out of the shell easily.  For me, both crabs could've been a little hotter though.   They also had fried clam strips, which were yum, oysters on a half shell, shrimp with cocktail sauce, fried oysters, and squid.   Didn't try any of the other food, but it looked appetizing.   Go here for the seafood buffet when in the mood. The variety is great.",

I left & didnt say anything. Asked the host for a manager. Alan the supervisor came. He is so nice & told him the treatment I got from Marvin. He immediately went into the chef to got me some prime rib & to my surprise thats the prime rib he got me on the picture i posted. Thanks for a very nice supervisor. Otherwise other staffs are very nice and accomodating.",

Thought I could fill up on tacos but the shells were stale and the meat was alittle iffy. Even the salad was off. The soda and the service were good. Soft serve ice cream was not good. We did happen to get dinner and a show when one lady took 4 plate fulls of the hot crab legs and an argument broke out and then a cop had to get involved. All in all I would not recommend this buffet. I'm just praying I don't get sick.",

Check in process was easy and we were seated after a few minute wait. Lots of variety to choose from besides seafood. Great slices of pork roast, loads of Chinese-American fare, and a wonderful desert section. 4 stars because the decor is looking pretty dated and the seats were ripped.   Tida was our waitress and she was a delight. I believe she said she was retiring soon but she definitely made us enjoy our time more there. She even recommended her son's Thai restaurant. Paradise definitely felt old Las Vegas and that's okay in my book!",

    "text": "Let's start at the beginning and work our way to the sad end. NOT worth $30 per person!!  They open at 4:00 pm, we got in line at 3:45 pm. Seating was very quick. We were two of the first eight people to be seated and go up to the buffet. The customer service was good. They were friendly and quick with our beverages. They also kept the table clean.  They had a cold seafood station (crab legs, salmon, peel and eat shrimp, oysters, etc). I'm not a fan of cold seafood so I bypassed this station.  Next was the American Fare...it consisted of instant (but yet hot and pretty decent) mashed potatoes. Brussel sprouts that were cold and only partially cooked. A pork chop in a brown gravy that tasted like it was served from a hospital cafeteria. This was later replaced with processed turkey slices that tasted like turkey loaf. It was one of the better tasting items. It was also a little warmer than luke warm.   Let's go to the Seafood station...none of the items were warm, let alone hot!! Fried shrimp that was ok, nothing worth writing home about but worth a review. Fried oysters that were soggy, fried calamari that looked like an onion ring and as chewy as a rubber band. The fried clams were as good as the fried shrimp. I think Golden Coral uses the same food vendors for both.  Next is the crab...two kinds. There was crab legs and snow crab. Both were cold, almost like they were part of the cold seafood station. They were watery and some (more than majority) tasted like you would think dirty dish water would taste like. Oh, don't forget to bring your own shell cracker. They say that the legs are presplit, which might  be why the crab is watery. They give you this plastic thing that doesn't work. It drew blood on my palm when I tried to open a claw. I recommend using your fork, it works much better. Not that the crab was with the hassle.   Italian station...Italians every where should be offended. The noodles where less than al dente and cold. The seafood bearnaise was heavy, rich, but yet without alot of flavor, oh and cold.   They had a taco bar that had card board looking and tasting hard shells. The taco meat had ok flavor but was cold. The other fixings were fresh, which was nice. The guacamole was good too. They jumbalya was over cooked and soupy but had good flavor. If you put it over the sticky over cooked white rice, and ask them to nuke it, it might have been good.  There was tortellini, a white sauce, a red marinara sauce that look like tomato sauce, cheese pizza, chow mein that look like lo mein, shrimp fried rice that had no shrimp in it and looked dry, a catch of a day that was in a red sauce, baked chicken that looked very dry, and craw fish. I didn't try these.   The salad bar was very simple but everything on it looked fresh. My supper partner had a salad and said it was very good.  I had the fresh sushi which was good. I'm not normally a fan but it did look very appetizing so I did try it and was pleasantly surprised.  then let's go to the last station which was the desert station everything looked excellent! The key word in that is looked. I tried five of the deserts. A bite of each and that was all that was needed. The first item I tried was the pineapple upside down cake. It was very dry on the outside if you cut into it and took the one bite that you cut around it was very tasty the pineapple was excellent in the flavor was good. However it was so dry it out from being cut and sitting on a plate for who knows how long that you could pick it up and drop it on a plate and it \"thunked\". The second cake was a white cake with a filling with another piece of white cake on top and a frosting it had a sprinkling of I'm not sure what on it. The flavor was good it had a coffee flavor. but again like the pineapple upside down cake it was dry from being  cut and set on plate for way too long. The next dessert was a key lime pie. Flavor was so so but again it was warm and should have been cold. The next item was a take on a pecan pie. It had bottom crust of the pie, inner feeling of the pecan pie and then the top was crushed pecans and then had been dipped in chocolate. This desert was good if you like pecan pie. The last dessert had several different flavors to it. It was probably the best part of the entire meal. It had orange, chocolate, and vanilla flavor.  Over all there are better places to go for half the price.",

The cracked crab and oysters on the half-shell were outstanding, and we definitely got our 21 bucks worth on that alone. Both were seeet and fresh. However, the rest of the buffet was not very good. The fried foods were overcooked and tasteless, sushi was nasty, desserts were generally disgusting, even the stuff they didn't make there, like eclaires, were dry and inedible.   I would say - if you are a big fan of crab and oysters, go for it. Eat nothing else but big piles of shellfish. Get your money's worth of those, then leave. I had five plates of crab and at least a dozen oysters! Avoid the rest.",

This place needs a major rehab and an improved menu. There was a weird smell in the place too.  The only redeeming factors were the price - it was like 17$ per person, which wasn't bad...and the fried chicken LOL.

Most of the other patrons are old enough to be my grandparents & it really reminds me of what I want out of life if I can stop being reckless & manage to live more than another 4 years.

At the same time, the assortment of food and the fact that its a buffet does give it good value.  On the night my family and I went, the tilapia was mushy yet somehow rubbery and I can't quite rationalize that one. The prime rib was quite tough and my medium rare steak was well done on the top half and rare on the bottom half. Everything else was okayish--nothing that tasted extraordinary but nothing absolutely horrible.  One thing I wonder about is the dim lighting. I was a bit uncomfortable and it felt odd. I had never dined in someplace so dim before and what makes me uncomfortable is that I like to see the food, what I'm eating in each bite and the state of the cleanliness of the eatery. It would definitely have gen the restaurant a more comfortable atmosphere if it was brighter, but not too bright.",

Quality : for the price, can't really complain.  Flavor : I'd give it about a 3.5 of 5  Menu - Hard to say as I've just ordered Ox tail so I'll rate based upon that.  Quantity : they give a LOT of meat for the price.  Quality : They must have it simmering in the back for a while because the meat literally falls off the bone. NO wasted meat lol.  Flavor : I enjoyed it. good additions with the water chestnuts and the shitake mushrooms.  the Service could use a little inproving. but it's just a suggestion/opinion. Not being critical ;)",

Baked potatoes were rubbery and butter did not taste like cream, it tasted more like melted plastic. The corn and bean veggies were definitely frozen before and were probably cooked over and over again. The desserts were okay, surprisingly.  Even for $14 a person for dinner, this is not a good choice for AYCE. You might as well get a good steak and very good sides at Second Street Market Grill a few feet down.",

It wasn't the most tender oxtail I've had but it still tasted really good and the broth too. I  wouldn't come back for any of the other food, but I'd definitely come back for a big bowl of oxtail soup.",

There was liquid all over the seats. Everything on the hot buffet was cold. The ribs and shrimp were both room temperature. I assume that they were hot when put on the buffet line, but had sit long enough without proper heating that they had enough time to get down to room temperature throughout. Room temp meats are a breeding ground for bacteria that causes food poisoning. My husband and I each took a few bites of our food and decided that we'd prefer not to get Norovirus or Listeria on vacation. I would have raised my concerns with management but couldn't find a manager.",

The jalapenos on the melt are definitely the type of pickled jalapeno you would expect to find shipped in a Sysco truck l, packaged in plastic, pickled in a cheap brine with lots of additives and  preservatives.  This is the type of food that kills people.    My server was Rachel she is super fabulous.  She gives great service!  A divine, patient woman.    I'm 3/4 through my sando & my hearts burns.  This food clogs your arteries but for your average American, it will do.    The decor of the establishment is interesting, they haven't updated it for over thirty years.    Super tropical 70's style!  I dig the lampshades!  Fake plants everywhere!  It's a look.  Whatever.    I like it even though it's outdated.    So much oil in my mouth, I can feel my bowels shutting down as I chew my food and swallow it.    Regardless of it being super fried and full of trans fat, I really enjoyed my party melt!  The toast was well toasted, it was served at the perfect temperature, my plate was scorching hot when it was brought out.    It's a decent meal, not healthy, so know what you're getting yourself into.",

The food isn't the best (the eggs are runny and not all the food was warm), but it was solid. There are tons of options from breakfast food to seafood to deserts (cakes and cookies) to lunch food to salad.   While the mimosas are bottomless you can tell they do try to limit what you have because they take a lot time to bring them to your table and even longer to bring refills after you ask.  At the price you can't go wrong with this buffet especially in Vegas, but just know the food isn't the highest quality and the service isn't the best.   Would recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap brunch!",

It's one of the cheapest buffets I saw in Vegas and it shows. Idk why the nachos are by the cold shrimp...the buffet is awkwardly placed. I would have to see the variety on the other nights like seafood night. FYI: they offer Pepsi products.",

I liked many of the desserts. Pies and cakes were there, as well as other desserts. Ice cream is available but no fancy gellato. That is fine with me.   This buffet is only $10. with a player's club card. It is similar to many of the buffets that were in Las Vegas before 1980. There are few of these kind left. The food is good and not fancy. (I prefer 'not fancy.\"). I prefer this kind of buffet to the fancy ones on the strip that cost five times as much as this. I hope Fremont Hotel continues to operate this type of buffet.

I figured I would spend $8 on some lukewarm fast food breakfast sandwich on the way to work so this had to be better...and it kind of was, but it was not a good buffet.   The buffet was easy to find on the main floor of the casino. It wasn't very crowded and I paid and was seated quickly. A server took my drink order and I went to get some food.   The spread is basic. There's nothing special or interesting about it at all but for $10 it was fine. There were two sections of hot food but they had identical items on both sides. The offerings included scrambled eggs, biscuits, sausage gravy, french toast, sausage patties, bacon, cinnamon rolls and a peach cobbler. They also offered oatmeal and grits I think.   The bread options were just dinner rolls and some little pastries, no croissants, baguettes or anything \"fancy.\"  There was an omelet and pancake station. The pancakes were pretty good and there was a basic selection of omelet ingredients like tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, bacon, ham, cheese, etc.  The cold section had what looked like canned fruit poured into bowls. There was some fresh cut fruit but again nothing special, just some melon and grapefruit. They had bagels and cream cheese but I didn't see any way to toast the bagel and they didn't have anything like cucumbers or red onions and definitely no smoked salmon to go with it.   For $10 bucks that I can expense it was fine but I'd go somewhere else for a sit down breakfast.",

    "text": "The moral of this story, you get what you pay for.   Came here for a Saturday morning brunch with the kids and it was strangely quiet.  They were a few dollars less than the other buffets in old Vegas so we thought we would give it a try.  Overall, it wasn't bad, it was actually ok. The selection was very limited.  It was between breakfast and lunch, so they had a little of both to chose from. When I say a little of both to chose from, I also meant little to chose from.   There was your usual pickings, eggs, bacon, sausage, ham and some other stuff. The lunch pickings were some kind of noodle dish, which I decline to try and the general chicken bake or fried.   Overall, for a semi-cheap meal/buffet, it was okay.  For about $5-6 bucks more, I would just go to a better spot.",

Lunch buffet was $9.99 and had many choices, and was very clean and food was good. You can not get a deal like that in town anymore. I felt like I stepped into 1979 in a good way, it was tropical and super Vegas with towering palm trees, mirrored ceilings, and big cushy booths. Easily one of my favorite new spots in Las Vegas.",

I think their best is the Salmon and the Roast Beef. I had like 3 plates of Salmon haha...they were really good! They had a lot of chooses for the desserts but.. I didn't think they were that good. If you really want good Buffet I guess you would want to go to a more expensive buffet at the strip! if you just want something to fill you up then this place can definitely fill u up but not for the taste.",

    "text": "When was the last time I was in Vegas? Yesterday!  Had dinner in the Paradise Buffet in the Fremont Hotel.  Cheap eats caught my attention.  Buffet with NY Steak cooked to order.  Hey, why not!  6:30pm and there just a couple people ahead of me to pay before entering.  It felt like I was lining up on the cafeteria line back in the days of elementary school.  But can't go wrong with a $26 dinner for two.   Endulge....all you can eat!  Went straight for the roast beef roast and mash potatoes.  Not bad.  They advertised sushi but it was only limited to tuna rolls (small strand of tuna surrounded with rice and wrapped in seaweed) - California rolls (Not good at all) - Somesorta roll (didn't know what it was but didn't take anyway and the shrimp nigiri.  Overall selection was not good for sushi.  New York Steak - 6 oz Grilled to medium rare.  The chef cooking it was more entertaining than the steak.   Crab legs were good.  Not the biggest but they were good.  The selections were good for the price.  Gotta love the soft serve ice cream.  This was not bad tasting considering I've tried some that just tasted like frozen milk.  I was too stuffed that I didn't get to try the Tacos, duck, and hot food items.  Salad bar was decent.  Dessert selection was okay with the different pies and cakes.  And the slices were sizely okay.  If you want to stuff yourself with a budget......go.  Don't expect much from though and you'll enjoy the experience.  The filipino servers were on top of their service with following up on drink re-fills even though I didn't need one, pre-bussing and extra napkins.  Would I go back?  Maybe not considering I have to experience all the other buffets in Vegas.",

The only really good things were the mashed potatoes and coffee.  The \"salad bar\" was potato salad, macaroni salad, lettuce & salad toppings, not much else. Some sort of Mexican food that was stale and the spagetti wasn't much better. The vegetables was just canned corn and the desserts tasted like prepackaged store bought grocery store items.  Maybe I just came here on an off day.  They did have sushi and seafood and meat for the meat eaters. Sure it was inexpensive for vegas. The buffet at main street station has a much much better selection and tastes great at the same price, I would recommend you walk the extra 2 or 3 blocks and go there instead of the fremont.",

    "text": "BYPASS THE BUFFET!!!! Wasn't this place called Lanai's in the past?  My friend who's also from the islands goes to this place all the time.  So, when I went to Vegas with him, he had nothing but good things to say about this place.  The secret?  Bypass the Buffet.  All the mainlanders eat the buffet.  But if you're from the islands, you have to eat at the Paradise Cafe in the back.  The lighting is dim, but who cares, I don't like people watching me eat anyways.  I've actually got in a fight with people who stare at me.  Anyways, go back there and be treated to the REAL island food.  Spam, rice (the sticky kind that's washed - not the minute rice that no self respecting islander would ever touch), Portuguese sausage, etc.  If you don't wash your medium grain rice and then measure it with your finger, you might not be using authentic sticky rice.  So, I walk into this place and see this nice buffet spread.  My friend tells me to keep walking and leave the buffet alone.  So I do.  We end up in the back at the Paradise Cafe where I see nothing but islanders eating.  This place MUST be good.  So we sit down and our waitress come around.  She has an island accent so I know this is going to be good.  What does everyone order?  Spam, eggs, and rice.  Now, I don't know if you know this, but the islanders like to eat.  So, when they bring our food out, it's overflowing over the plate.  They put a full can of fried Spam, a dozen eggs, and 2 cups of rice on my plate.  I also ordered Portuguese Sausage.  This is some good stuff.  The waitress keeps coming by asking if we want anything else.  Heck yeah.  We need more rice.  She hooks us up on the rice too.  She brought out a BIG bowl of rice so we can finish our Spam and sausage.  I can't finish my food, but everyone else doesn't have a problem with it.  For some reason my friend also ordered toast with it.  Toast?  Why not more rice instead of toast?  I think he sold out.  I keep looking around and it's nothing but islanders walking in.  She comes by to see if we needed anything else but we were good.  We then start asking her about some local island/asian store around here that we can get portuguese sausage.  She starts to tell us about some place that everyone goes to.  I was tempted but since I live in Cali, it would have gone bad by the time I got home.  Everytime I go to Vegas, this is a place I HAVE to go to.  You should try it too.",

There was no way I was going to drive or bus to the main strip for dinner, and I settled for this--which was a big mistake. I went on a Thursday night so there was no \"Seafood buffet\", however, there were crab claws, smoked salmon, and various choices of meat...which were questionable. As a sushi fan, I looked forward to the sushi, but was disappointed as they were the same quality as the pre-packaged sushi found in the supermarkets. The salad choices, or lack thereof, were extremely mediocre and so were the choices in fruits. In the middle of my dinner my stomach started rumbling which is a huge red flag to stop eating, so I did. However, I was sad that I did not get to try the some-what delicious-looking dessert collection, but I am pretty sure I would have been disappointed. The two stars are for the price ($9.99) and the quick seating service (which could be explained by the lack of people that were there). Definitely opt for a better buffet place or Tony Roma's which is next door.",

The one thing I do love is their breakfast buffet!!! I always get the omelette at the omelette bar. From that 1 omelette, you can already get your money's worth. Their fruit is always fresh and sweet! Their pancakes and belgian waffles were also amazing! Freshly made as well, so it's fluffy and soft :)   Their dinner buffet; however, did not impress. I went on their Steak night and that was pretty good. Cooked to order however you would like. Got my money's worth on that. Their Chicken Marsala was also good; it wasn't dry...phewf! Those were the 2 things that stood out to me. Everything else was average. I didn't like their soft serve or froyo or whatever it was. It's more like ice milk?   Also, if you want to do a la carte items, their Ox Tail Soup is really good and the portion is HUGE. Great flavors. When I got the saimen, it was soooo salty. I took out half the soup and added hot water. And even after adjusting the soup, I was soooo thirsty that night.   I forgot who our server was, but she was so friendly! She has a very long braid with bangs I believe. Ramona? Bleh, I forgot, but I just wanted to mention her :)",

    "text": "Compared with their newer brethren on the Strip, I've never been overwhelmed by the buffet offerings on this side of town and I'm afraid Paradise (ironically named) falls neatly under this description.  We visited on a Wednesday evening and the line was about 10 - 15 minutes long.  Then the price reminded us why we tried a buffet in the Fremont.  $35 for two!  These days the price for one is more than that in places like Bellagio and Caesar's Palace.  Everyone there from the register to table are nice folks that keep your drinks full and the table cleared.    Sure you saw this one coming, but come for the bulk, not the quality.  I sampled the shrimp pasta in cream sauce, the roast beef, fried chicken and some stir fried vegetables from the Chinese station.  It was steak night but I didn't like the look of the steaks they cook up in the center station weirdly next to the desserts which is also oddly where they put out sushi.  Pasta was meh.  Vegetables were meh.  Fried chicken was unbearably salty so I just ate the breast meat which was dry but I hate wasting.  Roast beef from the carving station is tasty!  If I hadn't discovered the chilled peel and eat shrimp and had three plates of those, I would have gotten a slice of my own.  They marinate the shrimp in bay spices and just enough brine to flavor them.  Squeeze three wedges of lemon on those and I'm in heaven!  I ate my money's worth and left just the right level of full.    Would I return?  Only if I happened to be on that side of town at the right time.  Otherwise, I'd still say the more exotic buffets are worth it even for more money.",

    "text": "First off Im not a HUGE buffet person since Im not only very picky but i just dont really eat alot. So with that said I decided to order from the Menu. Initally i thought the menu was going to be a good size with atleast a couple of good options for me(vegetarianish) but it didnt so i ended going with the Fried Shrimp w/ vegetables and Fries. Which made me a little upset because im not a fried food kind of gal but it was really one of the only things the had for me. I got my food and instantly I knew that it was from a bag/frozen food!!!! IM SORRY BUT NO! This was so nasty and ugh for $12.99 i couldve made this @ home. The only reason I give this place the two stafs is because our waitress Linda was a GEM!! A heart of gold and really did her best to accomadate with me. And the Atmosphere was nice",

Pretty standard, nothing out of the ordinary.   Psst! Hey! I'll tell you a little secret that we found out from a transplanted local....You don't have to wait for the middle of the night to get Oxtail soup at the Cal. Paradise Cafe offers it all day long. Lots of meat, great flavor, and a pretty big bowl. So when you go to the buffet, instead of getting in line for the buffet, ask to go to the Cafe. It's located way in the back, and you eat off a menu. Skip the line by taking the express lane on the right, and they will seat you right away.",

The selection was minimal.. so at $30/pp, not necessarily worth it. Otherwise, it's usually super cheap.",

Went for dinner Wednesday night, apparently it was \"steak night\" which upped the price to about $16.  Literally everything I ate was terrible garbage and I left hungry.  The \"steak\" was at best bulk bought truck scraps soaked in fake flavorings to taste like an actual grilled steak. The pasta was terribly overcooked and was like mushy tap water. The chicken picata was dry as a bone. The italian sausage was some sort of generic cafeteria meat. What I thought would be the saving grace was just some nacho cheese sauce and tortilla chips, but even the chips were stale as can be.  This place was so gross I left hungry.",

But I only came for the crab legs so I guess that's ok. Only bad thing is that they don't have crab leg crackers so I will be promptly seeing my dentist after tonight's dinner. Also, they used to split the crab legs in half for you before, so there was no need for crab crackers, but not anymore. Now you're left to wrestle the crab legs between your teeth.   My server was awesome. The food (with exception of the crab legs) not so much. Prob the last time I come here.",

After a nice conversation with a young couple and their friend they highly recommended the Oxtail Soup.  They mentioned that often come to Paradise Cafe just for this soup.  I wasn't disappointed!

I went on a weekday for breakfast/ lunch and they were closing all the stations for breakfast and bringing out lunch items. I spent a little over $30 for 3 people. I did get a chance to get an omelet from the omelet station. The ingredients were strewn all over the place and not much to choose from. I watched the guy make the omelet but, he loaded it up inside on cold cheese AFTER cooking it so, by the time I sat down to eat it, it was lukewarm. The cheese was still cold and didn't even melt. I couldn't even cut into it. I ate a few pieces of bacon, a greasy, tasteless sausage patty, and some sauteed potatoes that were old and cold as well and 2 child size cups of warm apple juice. Once lunch entrees finally came out, it wasn't any better. I sampled a fried chicken wing, some instant mashed potatoes that obviously came out of a box, a piece of roast beef that was overcooked and was tough like shoe leather. I also had a piece of Italian sausage that was quite salty and greasy. All of it was inedible. I wouldn't recommend this place. I won't be coming back. The atmosphere is dark and cheap, and the people working there looks like they're sorry they work in such a dump. I ended up eating a plate of salad which was actually fresh but, was a little too wet from washing the lettuce. Toppings were very limited but, seemed somewhat fresh. However, I won't be returning. I'll stick to the resort buffets.",

Skinny, overcooked snow crab legs with very little meat.  And if you're not going to provide any crab cracking utensils, at least score the shells!  And since they were overcooked, nearly impossible to remove from the shells.  I hate wasting anything that comes from a living creature but I didn't have much choice.  Rest of the food was bland and boring - no better than Old Country Buffet, but at twice the price.  I see that Brent H.'s review below raves about the crab legs, but clearly you've never had fresh Pacific NW dungeness crab - you'd forget all about these skinny little critters.  I guess I'm spoiled, so I won't be going back to this buffet.",

But, my parents really wanted to for the AYCE crab legs & shrimp, AKA seafood night on Tuesday's, so I had to humor them while they were in town for a visit. My Aunt & Uncle who were also in town played it a little smarter & went to Hash House at the Plaza :P   The place as a whole is a little depressing & the selection was just ok. I'm not usually a fan of snow crab legs, just because I feel the reward is not worth the effort of sitting there & trying to crack them open. However, I was mildly impressed by the fact that the legs here are already split for you & ready to go. Wow! And...they actually tasted petty good. I tried both the cold & the steamed...pretty tasty.   I wasn't very happy with the shrimp though, They were really bland & not even lemon juice, butter, and cocktail sauce could help :(   Also, we had a really bad waiter & I had no compassion for the fact that he was an old man. I really wanted to sock this guy in the head! & I will just leave it at that.   The 2 stars is actually pretty generous, but I have to give it to them for splitting the legs for you already.   Would I come back? Hmm...I think the jury is still out on that one.",

    "text": "Ok I honestly dont know what people are eating there but this place is not good at all. We went there mainly because of the reviews here.   First of all I asked for a med rare cut of the prime rib but the whole thing was cooked well done throughout. I figured since it might have been an old piece so I went back when they put out a new one and asked for another med rare piece. The carver was trying to show the person there where to cut for the raw slice and when he cut it down the middle it was well done again. Chicken was dry, pasta was soggy, and nothing looked appealing.   The waiters were all rude and mumbled throughout the time we were there. The jungle atmosphere wasn't attractive either. Yes the buffet is cheap but expect less than what you're paying for.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday night with my fiance for dinner.  According to the menus that were hung everywhere in the casino that meant that it was prime rib night which I was eagerly looking to.  I also noticed on a ton of signs that is was the largest buffet on Fremont Street which is interesting since the Golden Nuggets the next morning seemed bigger.  As we were walking into the buffet I was quickly reminded of some Rain Forrest cafes that I had been to.  It had those large palm trees as well as some other lush tropical looking plants.  The food at this buffet was just ok.  It actually reminded me quite a bit of the Golden Corral, lots there but no quality to it.  Yes there were peel and eat shrimp and crab legs but they were fairly meager which I guess is indicative of the price here.  They are had a random collection of other ethnic foods including a taco bar, sushi and random Chinese food.  Finally the prime rib.  What can I say about the prime rib?  Was it really prime rib or was it another cut of a tougher meat?  I have never had prime rib with the amount of connective tissue that was in some of the pieces of meat that I had here.  With that being said I really enjoyed the Cajun-esque seasoning that they put on it and I went back for more 3 separate times.  The desserts were really where this place shines as there were a ton of them and what I had was pretty good.  I ended up having key lime pie sans the crust and some carrot cake and both we pretty tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  It's not the worst buffet that you can get downtown but its not the best either. I guess it all depends on what you want your price point to be and what kind of quality you want in your food.",

    "text": "We came here on Prime Rib night and I will say that the Prime Rib was good, however I would have enjoyed it more if I could enjoy some side dishes with it. If you come on Prime Rib night I recommend just eating the Prime Rib. The carrots tasted like they were over cooked and underdone at the same time. I suspect they were previously frozen, which is not a big deal as long as they are cooked in a way where you can't tell. The sushi was terrible because rice was mushy. The Parmesan cheese they had was really weird and when I put it on my pasta it gave it a weird granulated texture. It is hard for me to describe the Parmesan cheese's weird flavor, but the color was off because it was pure white, maybe it was fat free?    The servers were really nice and very attentive. Our drinks were refilled consistently and they were very polite and friendly. I also really liked the ambiance, so it is a shame the food disappointed me so much.",

We only been here once for lunch and breakfast on our last day, I've enjoyed their omelette station twice^_^ the man behind the stove did a mini show of tossin and flippin, did an xtra w/them pancakes too. Mum&Dad didn't care much for the lunch buffet, but fills they tummy with it's worth anyway as they come with the Vacations Hawaii Package.  Speakin of which, my mum threw down the meal coupons as it was our last day, of them we only used 2-3.  Our server Rose, tells us we could use them at the snack bar for purchase or trade at any of the DT participating hotels.  To my surprise, after 15+ years my parents didn't know of this until now!  My poor dad was snackin on some them Trader Joe's omiyage the other Nite cuz he was hungry when he could've jus used them coupons for sushi or real food! Mum says no one has ever told them this. If my star rating could go to this server then it's all hers.  I mean, not only she had us learn bout them coupon books...she checked on us more than enough and refilled our coffee even when not asked. She talked to us a bit and she wasn't even filipino!! hahahha   Rose made a lovely experience after waking up a grouch at 730 in the ayyy emm. Except for that man up front, he must've woke on the wrong side of the bed too, grumpy rude man!",

There is very limited choice, maybe 9 dishes plus a carving station, small salad and cold cut bar, nachos, and a make your own burger and hot dog station.  This would be a great idea if the dogs and burgers were made fresh for you but instead they sit rotting in a warmer and are always over cooked and rubbery.  I have yet to get a fresh roll here.  Their specialty dishes are usually good however and I enjoy their fried chicken even though it may have come from the smallest bird ever and the staff behind the counter don't seem to care that I want a thigh and look at me like I am crazy.  My former boss used to take me here every now and then or I would have never gone back.  If you like cheap buffets, this is one but for the same price Red Rock has much better food and more quantity.",

    "text": "The thing I love about Vegas is for the price of a appetizer you can eat at a buffet.  Paradise Buffet, located in the Freemont Casino, is your stereotypical cheap Vegas buffet with tons of food items but lacking in quality  Parking: Parking available in the Freemont Casino.    Atmosphere: Kinda tacky. Think of dark rain forest, mirrors and green vinyl booths. All that and a big buffet.   I'm pretty sure this restaurant was featured in \"Swingers\" as the place the guys got dinner after they lost the money at the tables.  Service: This restaurant is both a Buffet and standard restaurant service.  For the handful of times I've been service has been fine without complaints. For both the Buffet and standard service waiters have been attentive and fast. If you have any problems its just getting into the place where if you go buffet you pre pay.  Cost: So for the Buffet it ranges from $7-8(breakfast & lunch) to $20(Tues night Seafood).  For the most part the standard buffet you're going to get your money worth for $14 although for Seafood night you could do better.  For standard restaurant service  most food ranges from $6-11 so depending on what time you go and what you want to eat it might be a better deal just to get the buffet.  Food: Like many Las Vegas buffets the food is just alright.  Well at least nobody ever got sick when they were with me.   I think the weekend breakfast brunch was my most favorite just do selection.  The times I've been the dessert selection was rather good.  Conclusion: Paradise Buffet is just your typical Vegas cheap buffet. Nothing amazing but your also not breaking the bank to get some food.  It's a bit tacky but if you get by that then its definitely worth it for breakfast or lunch(weekdays)",

    "text": "Here's my recipe for a perfect Vegas trip: Three parts obscenely cheap to one part ludicrously expensive. The $10.99 champagne brunch at Paradise Buffet is the perfect flavor for the obscenely cheap part of that recipe.   Are there even cheaper brunch buffets to be found in the City of Sin? I'm sure there are, but this is the perfect three star buffet for me. For the most part, it's what you'd expect from an $11 buffet - some of the stuff sucks, some of it is okay, the bacon was dishearteningly bad, but the prime rib was surprisingly delicious. They do tout themselves as a \"seafood\" buffet, but... that seafood wasn't looking too hot, so I stuck to the carving station.  And, of course it wouldn't be called a champagne brunch without the champagne.... that they bring to you in these awesome plastic champagne glasses (not flutes, but the older saucer lookin' ones). And, boy do they keep it comin'.... and comin'... and comin'. It's not one of those places that proudly declares endless champagne and then a waitress is nowhere to be found. No sir. You'll be lucky if you EVER see the bottom of that little plastic champagne glass here.  All of this in the lush, dark, tropical setting of The Paradise Buffet. A-OK through and through.",

    "text": "OK, you are in Fremont Street and you want to try some good ole fashion Vegas eatery at some insanely low price.  So what attracts the eye as you stroll down through the casinos? All You Can Eat Prime Rib Buffet for $13.00.  Now if that doesn't get your juices pumping I don't now what does.  SO with that said, A group of us went there to give it a shot as we were clueless as to what else we want to try and figured the buffet would give us some options.  We walked into the line and there were quite a few people ahead of us (good sign right?).  The food there definitely matched the price we paid for it.  Now I am not the one to judge solely on a few items and by looks alone so I decided to try at least one thing from each section.    First the good part: the Prime Rib was pretty tasty.  Not the best Prime Rib, but hey, I can't complain at this point.  It was definitely was savory and I was lucky enough to get it fresh when it came out.  If you decide to eat here just load up on this, you'll be happy...trust me.  The desserts were the next highlight.  The soft serve ice cream rivals that you get from a Souplantation with minimal toppings (fudge, nuts, strawberry in thick fruit sauce) but you can't really mess up when it comes to ice cream.    The bad part: The sushi can definitely be skipped at this place.  I normally don't have high hopes for sushi at buffets but this one is nestled right next to the soft serve ice cream dispenser and cakes.  Again minimal selection and the the rice that was used was spongy.  I mean..i can take a little stale, but this just felt like I was eating something artificial.    The rest of the food was below par (tried the fish, chicken, chow mien, and yams)....cannot comment on how it all tastes cause it was all just pretty much the same consistency as everything else.  If you are looking to save a few bucks, get some steak, and maybe load up on juices I'd say you can come here.  But for me, I think I'll spend a little more time trying to find a better eat in the Fremont Experience.",

I mean c'mon it's freaking dollar people . Also the prime rib was AWFUL very bland , cold. Tip for tourists , go to the Downtown Grand , where you get 1/2 off prime rib with a players card or the California , prime rib 9.99 every night , don't waste your time at the Fremont , the entire buffet was tasteless & the food was lukewarm to touch",

While I do come here with my parents when we are on vacation, it's due to the fact that we use the coupon book for meals that we can use with our hotel package. If it wasn't for the coupon, this place would be a total rip off.   So the only reason that I gave it a two star is due to the fact that the staff is friendly and if you have the coupon book then it's a decent deal for a meal.",

Their garlic clams were very good, and I stuck with the snow crab the rest of my meal. The cold snow crabs were sooooooooooo goooooood. I don't know if they salted them, but some were a bit too salty.   Either way, I had a blast and stuffed my face really well, and the fact that it was free, I can't complain. Now the True verdict is whether I would pay to eat here. If I'm stuck on eating snow crabs, I don't think it's a bad deal. Service was prompt.",

We went here on a Friday night, \"Seafood\" night, WAY WAY WAY over priced, the food was not very good at all looks like it sitting there for hours and when asked the staff is there any fresher foods coming out, their reply \"Nope not until that is all gone first\" I mean seriously? That is discussing! When asked when we paid to go if it was worth the price and of course they say \"yes, its very good\" Boy they are lying! Also really your going to try and sweep up around my feet when I am trying to get food. That is rude and nasty, the food was poor quality and cold, and not very presentable. Boyd Gaming really needs to thing about this property's buffet, I mean maybe they should close this one down. They had a small small selection, the staff is not very sanitary, they seem to wipe things on their clothes then handle your drinks. I will never again go here again and suggest anyone thinking about it, AVOID it, definitely NOT worth the price they charge!",

I decided to go to the Saturday Night Steak buffet and wow was I surprised. My  previous visits had been to their prime rib nights and I felt the food was a good value for the money. The steak night is not a piece a meat sitting in a warming tray. It's s steak cooked right in front of you to your liking. For the $15.00 tab the quality was very good and the rest of the buffet items were tasty as well. Keep in mind we're talking one or two steaks cooked to order plus dozens of sides for the modest $15.00. Other Boyd properties offer prime rib buffets as do most of the other Hotels in town and you can pay all the way up to the $50 plus range.  The Fremont Steak buffet is one of  a kind and will be on my list every time I'm in town on a Saturday evening.",

Vacation Hawaii provides food vouchers to use at this buffet. Also B Connected Players Club may offer promotion for free breakfast or lunch buffet (check the kiosk daily to see if you have promotion offers).  Breakfast Fruit bar offered bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, peaches, pears, fruit cocktail, and jello.  Restaurant customers may also choose ham, bacon, sausage patties, little sausages, scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, biscuits, toasts, miso soup, cold cereal, and other items I can't remember.  LOL. There is the omelette station where you can order your omelette any way you want or order easy over eggs.  The chef, Juan Rios who was April 2014 Employee of the month,  managed to cook the omelettes for the customers as well as replenishing the hot pancakes.   Lunch/Dinner Spaghetti, dirty rice, mashed potatoes, roast chicken, fried chicken, ribs, fish, and some other items were offered as well. Carving station had the prime rib and the chicken. Many choices of pies for dessert or settle for soft serve ice cream.  Wait help I had three different people as my wait help when I had my meals. One waitress (Monday/Tuesday breakfast as well as Monday dinner)  and was really friendly and always checked up on me. She made sure that my coffee never ran out. The waiter during my Wednesday visit for lunch was also was friendly and he too checked up on me. The second waitress during my Thursday breakfast did not even checked up on me nor did I get a coffee refill.   Overall my experience eating at Paradise Buffet was average. I enjoyed eating the hot pancakes and omelette for breakfast. The miso soup was a bit too salty. The fried chicken was a bit too dry. The mashed potatoes was delicious with the southern beef stew over it.   Next time I should try the cafe side of Paradise Buffet and Cafe.",

No where on their website did it say all one price or we wouldnt have wasted the time. I guess the fact that there was NO LINE should have been our warning. Luckily for us I didn't see the reviews of this place til now and it seems to be a blessing in disguise as most of the reviews are negative. O well, maybe a better web page would help.",

Both times we had excellent attendants and they were prompt at checking on us as well as bringing us drinks and clearing our plates.  We found most of the food to be good to very good; however, there were some things we really didn't care for.  Now, is this a bad thing? Not really....at a buffet we expect there to be some things we don't like and some things we do.

They do have a pretty selection of food to choose the breakfast was the deal though I should of gotten the French toast cause it looked yummy I got the two eggs rice and Portuguese sausage. Service was good and the food came out pretty quick. For price the cafe is ok vs doing the buffet unless you have coupons or a comp. I do prefer Market Street Cafe at the Cal over this.",

Don't complain about the lack of vegetarian options when you show up on STEAK NIGHT 4. Don't complain about the quality of steak when you are paying 15.49 a person.   Fremont's buffet is great. We tend to go on steak night to get our fill for about 35 bucks with tip. Where are you going to find a decent steak you don't have to cook yourself for that price? You're not. They have good roast beef too. There's a little for everyone, but their selection is low in terms of variety, that's why I recommend going when it's a specials night that you'll enjoy. It's old decor reminds me of what Vegas used to be like and reminds me that not everything downtown is changing.  We loved the guy manning the grill on Wednesday. His sense of humor was great and he knows how to turn a not so great cut of meat into a good steak.",

The salad bar was great as well. I made bomb salad I wish I could have used French dressing instead of French but there was only one person working in the food area and he looked like a chicken with his head cut off so I left him be and used ranch instead.",

    "text": "This was a last minute decision for my coworker and I to come here to the newly renovated buffet restaurant and enjoy some lunch.  Both of us has been here only once and didn't remember the experience from the previous experience.  The restaurant lounge has a very lush a floral-like decor to give you the impression of being somewhere exotic & tropical.  The food islands each have its own setting of food variances.  One is dedicated to freshly cut fruits, an assortment of melons and other well knowns.  There's a salad and cold cuts section with an assortment of premise salads like macaroni or potato salads.  In the middle, there's a build your own burger or hotdog station. It's a little confusing since you have a hot station for burger patty's, hotdogs, grilled onions, bacon strips, etc.   The buns are located next to it and yet May and ketchup or cheese is nowhere to be found. Also, there's a soft serve ice cream section which is sort of in an odd place. The remainder of that island is a lie and dessert section hosting Apple, cherry, blueberry pies and the other end a variety of cakes.  Along the back wall is the hot food station.  Beef bourguignon, mashed taters, roast or fried chicken, roast turkey or beef carved slice by slice, fried rice or plain, potstickers, cornbread etc.  Also know that there is also an ala cartel menu that provides specific meals - half of it is for our Hawaiian O'Hana who may want local island fare.  Not too bad, the food was good, chicken was juicy, the customer service was amazing.  One fun story, after making my first plate of food, I walked back to my table and set my plate down, before I sat I was already starting a conversation when I looked at the other person and realized I was about to sit at the wrong table.  Enjoy!  :)",

The food here was as good as a buffet could be.  Tuesday was the seafood fantasy day which was $21.99 per person.  If you had the player's card, then it was $1 off.  There were only two different kinds of fruit unless I missed the others.  Our waitress seemed like she did not want to be there, but she still refilled our drinks.  She even asked us, \"WHAT?\" as if we were bugging her.  That was the first time we came here.  When we left, the line to get in was very long and almost went out towards the entrance.  The other times we were here was for breakfast.   The omelette station was good as there was a chef there to cook it fresh just the way I wanted.  Our waitress was somebody different than the first time and so much better than the waitress we had the first time we were here.  I thought this place was A-OK.",

After 15 minutes the waiter brought a woman with him to our table. The woman wanted to know why we paid for 1 person and 2 of us were eating? I said, \"I told the cashier 2 people so I guess they cant understand English\". She said if you dont pay she would call security. My wife gave her a credit card to pay for 1 more person. When my wife looked at her statement the next day we were charged for 1 person and than charged for 2 people. I called the Fremont on 6/20 and had to leave a message. I have NOT received a call back as of 6/22. I feel we were scammed by the cashier or someone at the buffet. We are in our 60's and are not going to try to get a free meal. We have gambled 100's of times and ate at the buffet at the Fremont many times before. 6/20 is the last time for both. I gave it 1 star because I cant give them 0 stars.",

    "text": "Service + Restaurant Interior: 3/5 Price vs. Quantity: 4/5 Food Taste: 3/5  I've eaten at Paradise Buffet twice now. Both times I've had the same experience which was just O.K. So they get props for consistency. The biggest draw point for this buffet is the price. It's one of the cheapest buffets I've been to. The food quality, however, is lacking.  The restaurant interior is a little too dim for my taste with a cheap tropical feel. The place is clean though which gets points since it's a buffet and those tend to get dirty. The wait staff shows up sporadically, not the most attentive.  The best thing they have is hands down the fried shrimp. It tastes delicious, especially with some lemon and cocktail sauce. They are pretty large in size and fried to a point where each bite provides a crunch. The taco bar was pretty impressive too. They have numerous taco toppings including some refried beans. They weren't the best taco you'll ever eat but it was unlimited so I was satisfied.  All the Chinese food is mediocre. Most of it is dried out or lacking flavor so I would personally steer clear of that. The sushi is extremely limited in variety. They have a neat little salad/side bar that has various things like pesto pasta salad, ambrosia salad, seafood salad and more. I was actually pleased with that because it gave me a lot of things to try, all of which were so-so (except the ambrosia salad which was great).  They had a stewed meat which was definitely noteworthy as I don't tend to see stew at buffets and it was pretty tasty, but not very tender. The desserts were a nice surprise for the sheer variety that they have. It's more typical stuff like pies and cakes, so don't expect anything unique. The flavor of all the desserts is about what you'd expect, almost like a store bought flavor.  If you're on a budget and not picky then give this place a shot. You probably won't walk away thinking you just had the best meal ever, but it beats paying $30-60 a person at a buffet in the strip.",

After a night of heavy imbibing and glass clinking abandon, we ended up here, in the early morning, with thoughts of fluffy flapjacks caroling in our mind. The buffet is relatively cheap - a few shillings and you're home safe - so we thought we would spin the bottle on this place.   Immediately upon entering, the we noticed that most of the food was limp, lukewarm, devastatingly disappointing. My friend trudged and shuffled and bowed his head as if someone had just blindsided his soul. He compared the smells of this place to a a bleu cheese filled fish tank. While his statement was a hyperbole, it really didn't smell too appetizing.   The lack of selections sent me into a frown-induced tailspin. Still, it's pretty funny to see your friends sink into a pit of despair at this place.",

I wanted lots of fruit for breakfast as I eat a plethora of beef the previous day. The breakfast buffet is a bargain. There was plenty of fruit but some of it not quite ripe, some was pretty good.  For the breakfast buffet, there is an omelet station and pastry case.  There's the usual bacon, scrambled eggs, corn beef hash, pancakes, ham, waffles, cereal, sausage. They also include drinks of choice and I had orange juice, tomato juice and coffee... That alone would cost as much as the $8 I paid for the buffet at most restaurants. I had an omelet as well, so the buffet was a good value for me.  If you want an egg white only omelet, you can get it here... Cannot comment on their lunch or dinner spreads/value.",

    "text": "I've never really had a good experience with buffets. Paradise Buffet and Cafe Restaurant reminded me why I avoid them.  Yes, it's Vegas. Yes, they are known for world-class food and excellent buffets. Just remember that NONE of them are located in Downtown Las Vegas.   The establishment is located in the Fremont casino. It's large and maze-y with roomy booths. The decor isn't vintage; it looks like a 1980s highschool set for Wizard of Oz. There's alot of green.  First off, our waitress didn't know what half-and-half was when we requested it with coffee. She kept pointing to the french vanilla creamer already on the table. I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place....  They had a decent variety of food from American hot-dogs and patties wading in gray, hot water to Italian pasta, dried out from the hot lamps to \"Chinese\" stir-fry that could rival any MacCormack seasoning packet available at most grocery stores. I opted for jambalaya, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and beef roast from the carving station. I've never had jambalaya before (at this point) so wasn't sure what to expect; it tasted okay:lots of sausage and my friend told me it tasted like it came from a can. Can you go wrong with mashed potatoes? Yes, even Paradise can! When I attempted to add butter to the flavorless mash, I could only find margarine...Ugh, isn't anything real here? Not too surprising, after all, they didn't have half-and-half... Everything ersatz!   Fresh fruit and a piece of apple pie for dessert. Pretty sad when the fruit was the best part of the meal.   Lunch buffet cost about $9. A bargain, one might say, for a \"Vegas\" buffet. All the strip buffets were starting around $30.  There's a reason why the restrooms are located at the exit of the restaurant with large, brightly-lit signs. Now, I love food, and if that food disagrees with my digestion but it tastes delicious, I'm willing to give a little leeway. When I eat a less than mediocre meal and additionally have the inconvenience and discomfort of immediately needing a restroom, I am not a happy camper. In toto, six out of our group of eight ended up in the restroom. The women's bathroom was clean, however, the males in our group recounted a disgusting state of the men's restroom.  Why 2 stars in stead of 1? Although the entire experience was sub-par, there is a possibility our 6 days of Vegas binging finally caught up to us and contributed to our sickened state. Even without sickness, not worth $9.",

I have been to this buffet several times for breakfast only and can truly say it is very good for the price  and I look forward to eating here every visit.   The price is one of the lowest in all of Vegas and  weighing all out this buffet has good breakfast and  considering Mc D's and Burger King is about $5 for A  breakfast that is small and cheap, you get reasonable  bacon, eggs, freshmade to order tasty omelette's with  fresh eggs cracked right in front of you, fruit, veggies,  desserts, shrimps, salads, and much more for A very  low price.   This is a buffet that has reasonably good food that is  very good for the price, and I recommend their made to  order omelettes so you can pick what you like and  have it made in front of you.  In conclusion, where on earth can you get quality fresh  made unlimited omelettes, bacon, eggs, fruit, bacon,  sausages, desserts, and so many other options that  are reasonably good in the year  2015 and after for less  than $8 bucks with a server bringing you unlimited bever- ages and on top of that all items are reasonably good and tasty.  All in a nice nostalgic dining area with nice plants to accent the paradise theme?  To expect expen- sive gourmet food for a low price would be unreasonable in my opinion.   Try other buffets and you will pay double for similar food.",

When we wanted a 4th mimosa, we were told 'bottomless' means 3 max. And you are not allowed to mix them together. (We asked for a larger cup to mix the small glass of champagne and small glass of oj together and no one had an issue brining us them). The food and beverage manager Marco told us he felt 3 was plenty. If I wanted to have 3, I would have stated at arrival that I only wanted a few. He argued with my husband and refused service. Biggest waste of $40 in all of Las Vegas. You lost customers for life Fremont. Marco was extremely rude, interrupting my husband constantly about his right to refuse. You need to specify at arrival the meaning of 'bottomless'. Very displeased.",

The service is always good, the food is always more than satisfactory, and the value will leave you feeling great!! In fact on our last trip this buffet trumped the Bellagio hands down (over salty, cold crab legs? no thank you).  We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and there was no lineup.  It includes \"Champagne\"--some fizzy stuff which I didn't end up getting (you actually have to ask for it even though it's included and unlimited) which makes $10.99 (with their free players card) a great deal.  I had tea instead, which was good.    Brunch included stone crab (better than the crap @ the Bellagio), prime rib (not bad), and white rice (for some reason I crave this stuff when I go away).  Lots of breakfast items like sauteed sausage with onions and other fare. I left stuffed and so happy!!  Dinner is good value and tasty as well!",

    "text": "The Fremont Casino boosted that its' buffet is the \"biggest and best\" in the Fremont area.  Okay...that really doesn't say much since it's probably the only buffet in town.  I came here for the buffet since the price was hard to beat.  Buffets on The Strip were charging $11.99 up to nearly $35.00 so at $6.99, I couldn't resist.  Soon the phrase \"you get what you paid for\" kicked in.  First off, I came here right between the breakfast buffet cutoff.  The guy at the counter gave me two choices: either pay $6.99 for the limited breakfast buffet (whatever they haven't put away) or pay $7.99 for the lunch buffet (in which I was not allowed to eat breakfast items).  I didn't fully understand that kind of mindset but just to be on the safe side, I opted for the lunch buffet.  Once seated I noticed how dark, dingy, and outdated the dining area was.  The booth that I was sitting in had rips on the seat and the carpet was pretty stained.  After a few minutes, a server came and asked about drinks.  He brought the drinks to the table and I never saw him again.  In fact if I needed something like utensils, condiments, or extra napkins I got up numerous times to get them myself (*boo*).  It was 10 minutes until they bring out the lunch buffet items and yet I sat there not sure what to do.  Since I paid for lunch, I was told that I can't eat breakfast items.  And yet the time at the paid parking structure was ticking and I was quite hungry.  Since there were still a few breakfast items out, I went for it.  From what was left I got myself a sliver of cooked ham, one slice of whole wheat bread, half a spoonful of country potatoes, and (worst item ever) a very small amount of \"eggs\".  Nothing on my plate was appetizing but the \"eggs\" were just inedible.  It was not real but powdered \"small curd cottage cheese like\" eggs that tasted nowhere close to the real thing.  I had a forkful and discarded the rest.  The bacon was another story...not sure if it was a pig.  It tasted like cheap bacon with absolutely no smoky taste to it.  After what it seem to be forever, lunch items were brought out at 11 a.m.  Again the selection of food wasn't the greatest but I did like the grilled chicken, pork chops, and salad.  They had a \"build your own\" burger bar in which I grabbed myself a meat patty only.  It was fairly good but dry.  Fruit bar was also good but one side of the bar was completely empty and it stayed empty.  If I were to point out the \"shiny star\" of this buffet, it would be the dessert.  Many sweets to choose from and I did like the coconut white cake.  For what it's worth, I got.  It's not bad but it can use some improvement.  The size and variety of the selections can be bigger but I'm not really a fan of absent service and no acknowledgment.    *Tip* if you parked in the Fremont parking structure, you can have your ticket validated at the Be Connected booth out in front but remember to bring your buffet receipt.",

This is their seafood buffet night.  The first funny thing...well maybe it wasn't funny for them, was the couple in front of us.  The cashier ran their credit card through and said, \"Do you have another card?\"  The husband looked puzzled.  I turned to my mom and said:  \"Do you think she told her husband about all the cash advances she'd been taking out on that card?  I bet she's so out of control, she can't keep track.\"  (evil laughter)  Mom: You're terrible (but she laughed with me) Me: The apple don't fall far from the tree Mom: (pause) You're adopted (evil laughter)  So yeah, the apple don't fall too far.  I ate turkey and roast beef, shrimp scampi, salmon, and Louisiana style seafood stew.  lasagna, California rolls, peeled shrimp, and a little salad...the healthy part.  I had lemon meringue pie, key lime cheesecake, and a mini eclair.   Me: Okay, I'm full.  The second funny thing was this little kid kept running around the buffet line and the manager chasing him down to scold his parents.  The last funny thing is the woman who took her sweet time and had to make everything neat on her plate.  Because the Fremont Hotel is part of the Sam Boyd Chain, the meal cost us $6 each.  Not a bad deal.  We then slowly walked out to Fremont Street to watch the Experience.  It was a fun evening with the parents.",

    "text": "Ok been waiting to get home to write this.  Me and my wife and youngest daughter were staying at the Fremont Hotel and decided on eating there as well.  We went down stairs and walked into the Paradise Buffet, my wife asked the cashier how much for my 6 year old and she informed her it would be full price, without my wife even asking the cashier took it upon herself to waive the cost for my daughter, all 36lbs of her.  She even cleared it with a male manager.  We proceeded to be seated close to the buffet which was nice since I was hobbling already from over doing it walking on the strip earlier that evening.  As soon as our waiter came by he asked about drinks I told him 3, he asked how many we're eating and I again said 3.  He looked at the receipt and noticed we payed for 2.  I told him what the cashier had done and he said ok and walked away.  5 minutes later a female manager walked over and told me we would have to pay the $17.99 for my daughter to eat.  I said I would talk to my wife and we would handle it, she said ok and left.  Our waiter, who clearly must have ownership in the buffet came by again and was looking for the receipt that we paid for my daughter, I told him we had not yet, at that time my wife came to the table and informed him that the male manager had approved it, our waiter/owner said the manager has no right to approve, such a drain on the business and cash income of such a struggling establishment, ok he just said the manager had no right to approve that.  So now our appetite is ruined, we are pissed and I want to kill our self important arrogant bastard of a waiter.  But after he and his favorite manager went and spoke with the original manager, who apparently COULD approve such a thing, they dropped it and left us alone.  The food was ok, not great.  The service was ..... Well let's just say this, never never never never again.",

Now, the buffet wasn't as huge as some of those on the strip, but it had plenty of options.  The night we went was prime rib night. They also had whole chickens and turkeys available as well (slices, that is...you don't get a whole turkey for yourself you fat bastard). The salad and dessert bar is sufficient.

    "text": "Probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4, but the price was right and a 2-for-1 coupon sweetened the deal.  Our champagne brunch was quite nice. We each asked for orange juice with an extra glass so we could mix our own mimosas, and the drink waitress looked surprised but complied. The orange juice was great and fresh tasting, so the mimosas were a highlight.  The prime rib was good. The delicious Korean chicken was the best thing I tried. The lamb was only okay. I didn't much care for the stone crab claws (my least favorite kind of crab). The peel-and-eat shrimp was very pleasantly spiced, another winner. The seafood bisque was okay; the soup itself was good but the plentiful seafood was not very appealing and brought it down a notch. (Fake crab, a few tasteless scallops, and tiny shrimp that didn't seem to make any difference other than to give you something to chew.)  The hash -- apparently a big favorite of Hawaiians -- was only adequate, straight from the can and heated the bare minimum. The sausage was okay. The bacon was the best bet among the breakfast meats; but if you like your bacon crisp, you won't like it. The array of lox and fixin's for bagels looked pretty good, but we didn't try it.   The pecan sticky rolls looked marvelous but were unfortunately disappointing. If you like oatmeal, there is a great selection of toppings. There was the usual huge array of buffet desserts.  There's a nice selection of flavored syrups for dressing up your coffee, but instead I added whipped cream. Delicious.",

    "text": "Fremont has a wonderful hidden treasure in the back of their casino, their Paradise Buffet. It's small but reasonably priced and offers a fine selection of food. No real surprises, it's what's become the standard buffet lineup of entrees, an omelet/pancake station, and southwestern and Chinese dishes. Sunday Brunch offers some extra seafood (shrimp, crab) and champagne. It's not the good stuff, but believe me, after a glass or two you won't notice.  I was lucky enough to visit champagne brunch with a group of frinds who also like to play with their food. The buffet selection inspired me to assemble a southern-style plate of fried chicken and waffles with a side of fruit that tasted divine. Then I hit the dessert bar. Again, nothing fancy here, but a nice array of cakes and pies with soft serve ice cream also available. Extra credit to the buffet for offering sugar free pies and cake as well.  The best thing about the Paradise Buffet may be the decor. It has the darker feel of classic Vegas casinos, but there is an attempt at tropical lushness with plastic greenery and flowers throughout and a large aquarium at the entrance. The buffet is set off by crystal-accented chandeliers and lighting, the ceiling is all mirrored tile. Liberace would've been right at home here - and I mean that in the best way possible.  One star off my rating for a poor first impression: the restrooms are at the entry and they may be the first thing you smell coming in from the casino. But once you're over that speedbump, it's all good.",

    "text": "Wow.  Worst dining experience I've had since a little buffet in Louisiana.    Terrible old and dingy decor.  Our seats and tables were basically hosed down. It was all wet from someone \"cleaning\" it.  The buffet was scary and I thought I may get food poisoning, so I stayed away from all mayonnaise concoctions.  Prime rib was a dark brown - totally overcooked.  The condiments for baked potatoes were set-up before the utensils, not after the baked potatoes - so I had to go in reverse in the buffet.  Most of the selections were meat.  The salad bar, ugh...The vanilla ice cream was out and there was an array of drip bowls for dripping machine.  The shrimp were a strange orangey brown color and cocktail sauce was drizzled all over the bar.  There was a mess of serving spoons everywhere. The chicken was good.  But I picked a hair out of it. not even a decent dessert could appear here. My silverware was sticky to start.  The chocolate cake tasted like a recycled HoHo.    The whole experience was simply awful. At $36.00 for two people, it's not even a deal.    I am convinced all the other buffets on town ship their week old leftovers here to serve.  I feel bad for posting this because some of the servers were very sweet people and I can't imagine having to show up here everyday.  OMG.  Just an awful experience.  *  after reading some of these 3 - 4 - 5 star reviews, I'm really worried for some of my fellow Yelpers.  This place is dangerous.  I'd rather hand over my life savings to a drunk leprechaun dancing naked on a roulette table at O'Shea's than ever set foot NEAR this place again.",

    "text": "Well.... Where to start???? I was on Fremont street for the Year of the snake celebration events and I was hungry.... I took a walk from the stage and found myself lost in a different time zone.... Did I fall through a time rift that brought me back to the early 80's hmmmm...... I like the music and the TV shows were great but I digress.  No time rift no alternate universe on Fremont Street.... Nope I was in the Paradise Buffet... A look back into a culinary error (sorry mean to say ERA) that has long past on the Vegas strip but is alive and well in on Fremont Street.   Atmosphere- Interesting if you like that vintage diner feel... (yes plastic flowers and all)  Service- Great!!! Our server was right there as soon as I put down my fork or hit the bottom of my glass with the the following line \" Go get some more\" and \"Let me refill that for you\" The Hawaiian shirts and the flowers in the hair I guess you can compare to \"flare\" that you see at other restaurants but it just fit right in with everything else.   Food- Ummm hmmmmm well It was ummm homey and not in a bad way the items on the buffet were ALL very identifiable from the iceberg lettuce salad (really) to the cold cuts (really really) to the make your own taco station. You knew what you were getting yourself into from a culinary standpoint and did not have to ask any question about what an item was. More then likely you have had it a few nights ago for dinner.   All in all great place to sit relax and enjoy some comfort buffet food that you WONT see on the Vegas strip... ANYWHERE and that is not a bad thing.",

    "text": "I came while in Vegas, and this remains the worst service I have ever received in any type of Restaurant.   Me and my fiancee were quickly seated and told to go ahead. We waited around for a bit for our waitress to take our drink order, after a few minutes, we decided to go get food. Got back with plate number 1, which was pretty small. Still no waitress or water on the table. 1/3 way through plate one, I ask a hostess for water, she tells me waitress will be there soon, but she's really busy.....  A minute or two later a waitress checks in on the table RIGHT next to me and asks if they need anything else and she starts to walk away..I flag her down and ask her for water, she said no, I'm not in her section and your waitress was very busy but would be there shortly.  Few more minutes go by and yet another hostess walks by, and I again plead for a glass of water. She stops, picks up the receipt, and says \"you haven't even been here that long, your waitress will be here soon.\" She proceeds to go stand by the podium and do nothing.   I finish plate and go grab another. Pretty annoyed. I get back and yet another employee walks by and again, I plead for a glass of water. I'm now nearing the point of just standing and up and screaming can I get a fucking glass of water. The employee says he can't get me water, but will go get my server. FINALLY my server comes over, no apology for the wait, no nothing..just a glare at me and \"what do you want?\"  I wanted to say, I'd like to eat at a place where the servers aren't bitches, but requested a water and juice. A glass of water was thrown down and juice was served.  Food was marginal. The cook at the omelet bar was friendly, but that was it.  Avoid this dump.",
