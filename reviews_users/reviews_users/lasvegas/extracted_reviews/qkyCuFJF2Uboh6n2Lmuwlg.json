    "text": "Popped in Lee's to grab an iced coffee and grilled chicken sandwich before leaving Vegas. I thought this was a good idea because I love their coffee.  This location is huge, probably easily double if not triple some of the other ones I've been to. There are plenty of tables for customers. I am assuming there's a huge demand for cheap Vietnamese sandwich at all hours of the day/night since this is a 24hr location. My assumption is probably correct except holy moly, no cheap sandwiches at this Lee's! Everything on the menu is at least a dollar more expensive. What I pay for a large coffee back in LA can only get me a regular size. I guess the sandwiches are still cheaper compared to most American joints, but certainly not by the Asian standard.    I waited a good 20 minutes for my sandwich and drink. And I'm not really sure why it took that long because there aren't many people ahead of me, and they had at least 2 people making the sandwiches.  My grilled chicken sandwich was pretty dry compared to the ones I've had in other locations. Not a fan of this Lee's and will not be returning.",

This place is good because it's open 24 hours but other than that it's not a good place to go to not a lot of selection for food besides sandwiches. Don't come here expecting is going to be another Lee sandwich from San Jose or LA because it's not. Save your money.",

    "text": "If this is your idea of a ***good*** (not best, because there isn't such a thing as perfect) banh mi, please expose yourself to more locations.  The good things about this place: +Fast +24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes) +Bright and clean  +Clean restrooms +Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing. +Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.  The caveats: -The sandwiches (more on that later) -Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!) -A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches  The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh.   The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.     Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed!   I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya!   What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.  As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!",

Other than Spring Mountain Rd. always being congested as fudge, This Lee's I loved better than LA Lee's.  There was a generous amount of meat, an overload of veggies (which LA Lee's lacks on giving), and lastly...........the bread was SOOOO fresh - lightly crispy and soft at the same time, NO murder on the roof of ur mouth!  The bread was still warm out of the oven, i've never had that from all the other locations.  Everything seriously tasted fresh.  I'm bummed i only ate 1 sammich.  Being preggo right now, i could've totally devoured 2 and taken another one to go on the ride back home.    I will definitely come back fosho.",

    "text": "I usually stop by here when I am in Vegas. Mostly because of their Iced coffee, and I will buy the small bottles to help me stay awake. The caffeine is strong, but is it also very good tasting and you don't have a huge crash afterwards. So when you have to stay awake, it helps a lot. The restaurant itself is very clean and there is a lot of space for people to sit. They actually expanded the restaurant, it was much smaller before, and now they made it bigger. It must have gotten quite popular.  They also have really great sandwiches, different options of breads, meats, or vegetarian. They also make french bread rolls often, you can buy them for cheap if you want. I will usually buy one or two before heading back home to LA, and just stick it in the oven to heat up. Finally the price is good, it is not very expensive. So after you lost your money (or won) you can buy yourself a sandwich to stay sustained.",

    "text": "I came here a good handful of times before I actually found something that was good. When it first opened, because of the excitement  I came here 2 or 3 times in hopes of finding something good from this Viet chain. Unfortunately I gave up and never looked back. Oh wait, never say never? I recently visited due to the fact my friend and I had a night out and had the late night munchies, but we were on a budget. Oh hey, why not Lee's since it's cheap and its open at 2 in the morning.   Grilled Pork Bahn Mi- mmm! nice flavor on the pork. the spread was also tasty and I'm actually a fan of what most people refer to as their \"super hard bread.\" I just love that crunch! The veggies could of used a little bit more work because they were just 'blah.' Overall I really liked it especially for the size and price. But I mean most Bahn Mi places can't mess up on the signature grilled pork sandwich. Highly recommend this and nothing else.   Vietnamese Coffee- my first time drinking viet coffee, made me kinda anxious since I heard a few stories about it. Pretty good and in my first few sips I tasted as if it had a hint of alcohol  flavor. I wanted more, but I ordered the smaller size not knowing about it's deliciousness.   The other things that I ordered in the past and didn't satisfy my pallet.   Sardine Banh Mi- the veggies were even worse my first time around. Especially the cilantro which was pretty much wilted. I didn't really taste the spread nor see it either. Let's just say this sandwich was sort of a disaster... And this was my first Lee's experience. Obviously not giving me a good first impression.   Coconut waffle- this looked really delicious with it being a bight green color and all. I just had to order it because it was looking me in the eye as I was waiting in line to order. Unfortunately it was super soggy with an ok coconut flavor. Kinda disappointed it didn't live up to what I had hoped for.   Beignets- once again it looked delicious under the heating lamps in the display case. UGH wrong... I wasn't really fond of the texture. I feel like it was lacking something, probably sweetness. Once again something I do not recommend.   Although I did enjoy the girlled pork banh mi, it doesn't make up for all the miss haps for all their other products. Plus, I'll only go here for my bahn mi fix if it's another one of those late night munchies kinda thing. Therefore, 2 star rating- sorry!",

    "text": "Nostalgia galore! Back when I was a youngster (ok, back when I was like 10-14, maybe not so young) living in Orange County, my family and I would often stop at one of the various Lee's Sandwiches around town, and they were always pretty damn good.  So, when I was driving on the 215 home from California a couple weeks ago and saw a giant billboard with the name \"Lee's Sandwiches\" on it, I was excited. Very excited. So I stopped by after work the following week, picked up some sandwiches and boba smoothies, and brought it all home. The first thing I noticed was that, wow, this place was pretty big! Of course, now that I think of it, the other Lee's Sandwiches were as well, but I had sorta forgotten it. It would totally be a perfect place to hang out with a group of friends, or meet up with someone; conveniently which could be done whenever seeing as they are \"ALWAYS OPEN.\"   The menu was huge, and to the right there was a large froyo area as well, giving a lot of options, but I was here for the sandwiches, and ordered the BBQ pork, grilled pork, and grilled chicken.   Got home, split the sandwiches in 3rds and had some of each. They were delicious. But like many others, my gripe comes with the amount of meat in the sandwiches, there's just not enough! I would rather pay an extra dollar and have a meaty sandwich, then have one skimping on the meat. But regardless, $3.50 for a 10\" sandwich is good, and I was quite satisfied. I'm already looking forward to going back and trying their sandwiches.  P.S. According to the wiki on bahn mi sandwiches, the they originate from the French countryside \"salad sandwich,\" so perhaps there's a reason why there's not too much meat. I'll try asking for more next time though.",

    "text": "BASED ON BREAKFAST ONLY: Not impressed. Should have known better based on the reviews on here but I was desperate and hungry on my way to work this morning. I got the bacon, ham, egg and cheese on a baguette and a raisin croissant. The sandwich took a few minutes and I was so ready to tear into it when they handed it to me. I was on my way to work so I took it to my car to eat on my drive. Unfortunately I quickly found out that my sandwich was cold. Not warm, cold. I can't remember ever, EVER, getting a breakfast sandwich cold. It didn't even feel like it had ever really been hot. The ham for sure had not been heated up at all. It was fresh out the cooler. Oddly, the sandwich was still decent tasting (maybe I was just that hungry). The baguette was good and had a nice crunch to it. If this sandwich was served hot as it should be this might be a completely different review. Note to self: stick to McDonalds breakfast. Oh and $10 minimum on Credit Card for a restaurant/food chain is absurd.",

    "text": "Best Boba Smoothie I've ever had!   This place was amazing... for smoothies. I'll level with you here.... I didn't try ANY of the food. I only had 5 bucks on me at the time.   They let a group of us hold a super smash bros tournament there though in a side room for a pretty decent price. That plus the ridiculously awesome boba smoothie made it a pretty great experience for me. Looking forward to the next tournament just so I can get more of those smoothies.  To the complaint below that it's ridiculous to put a 25 cent surcharge on all items...... Consider opening a restaurant for 24 hours. Consider the cost of being open during hours that business is far from \"booming\". You might understand needing to charge just a little more merely to stay open 24 hours a little easier. Not every cost increase in the world is made out of greed.",

    "text": "I have never written comment on Yelp before, but I do consult Yelp often before or after each visit to different eatery places...Decided to start my first review for this Lee's because I felt that I need to do Lee's some justice. I do not get paid to write this review between. Everyone has his/her own preference, and this is just my 2 cents.  PLACE/LOCATION: huge, plenty of sitting areas, free wifi, clean, hip hop music at night, huge TV screens, open 24 hours! (very clean toilets...A+)  SERVICE: everyone is so amicable and gracious...young, polite college students who work around the clock to pay their own bills.  FOOD: I love number 11 (special combo). The baguette is fresh, aromatic, and the taste is enhanced with just the perfect amount of mayo and pate.  I was not a big fan of meat...but this place adds the right amount of meat (sliced not too thin or too thick) carefully curled up inside the baguette and the taste is flavorful, not too salty or too dry. House pickles, cilantro, jalapenos, and onions add the final touch nicely. You could always request what to leave out. There are so many options on the menu that I would come back to try them all. Next time, vegetarian baguette! There are Asian menu and European menu for sandwiches...serving the diverse community of Las Vegas. Very clever.  DRINK: Smoothies are great. I love the avocado smoothies and sugarcane juice freshly made. I will try the Italian sodas next time! I heard this place is famous for their coffees as well....too good that customers often complain that there is too little amount of coffee...but if it's that good, I won't mind paying for a second one...because it's cheaper than a Starbucks' latte and the quality is comparable! My friend actually says that there is a reason Lees puts a lot of ice inside their coffees: the dark coffee would melt with the ice so that the coffee would not be too strong, too sweet or too bitter....It's a tradition of coffee drinking in Vietnam.  Overall the experience is great, for a fast food place! We will definitely come back!",

My sandwiches were full of lots of meat, the right amount of condiments, and were served on very fresh bread.  And I ask the haters.... where else are you getting superior Banh Mi sandwiches at this price, level of cleanliness, and similarly easily-reached location? Sure you can get a more homestyle Banh Mi in a hole in the wall and even then it isn't THAT much better.  Honestly it's a Banh Mi sandwich. It's a really simplistic food.  If they screw it up there's no way they'd stay in business with the amount of competition in this area. From what I understand it is downright cutthroat in that area.",

Initially, I didn't want to say anything to the store, but my friends urged me to and one of them talked to an employee at the pick up counter with me. The employee, she, told me the drink was made by a new employee who didn't know the steps well and filled the cup w all ice. I was disappointed but still gave it a 4-star because the second employee went back and gave me a free refill. Thank you, the second employee. Sorry I didn't get your name.",

It's in the Pho Kim Long parking lot, so beware of parking. It's in an Asian plaza (if you get my drift). The employees are not friendly whatsoever. The one chick who took my order even got annoyed when she gave me someone else's food. Like hello? You handed me the bag! Sorry for being an inconvenience to your life.   Anyway, on to the food. The watermelon smoothie was disgusting. They don't use fresh fruit, so it was that super fake watermelon syrup tasting crap. Mixed with boba that turned solid after 5 minutes of being in the smoothie, just awful. It got thrown away after 2 sips. What a waste of $5! I hate their baguettes here because they are seriously like break-your-teeth hard. So, I opted for my sandwich on a croissant. Instead of the light and flaky croissant that we all know, what I got was bread baked into the shape of a croissant. Effing deceiving people! If you look at my picture, you can clearly see its bread and not a croissant. The meat was boring and tasteless. My bf had to put Sriracha on his sandwich when I brought it home just to add flavor to it. He also said the baguette was hard, which I already knew.  Ok, and they have this stupid policy that states any purchase with a card between 9pm-5am will be charged an extra 25 cent PER ITEM! WTF!!!! I'm pretty sure they make enough effing money to suck up credit card surcharges. If not, go back to being cash only. Don't be cheap and try to suck up any bit of money that you can.   I used to like eating here when I was younger and didn't know the difference between food and good food. After eating so many bahn mis throughout my years of living in Vegas, I can strongly confirm that I will never eat here again. Garbage, just garbage!",

    "text": "Went here on a whim since we wanted a banh mi but didnt want to go to a pho restaurant. I was skeptical since it had such low ratings but my wife convinced me to go anyway.  First of all there was one guy making most of the sandwiches and taking care of the side dishes like pork buns and sesame buns. The line was and continued to be almost to the door way. We waited for around 15 minutes in line and while there, i witnessed at least 3 groups of customers leave due to how slow the service was. I also need to mention that because its so crowded, the temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably hot and this is vegas so im accustomed to the heat. It is also very cramped when its busy as well.  The sandwiches were not that great. It was very small for the price and the meat in the combination was thin. The mayonaise overpowered and drowned out a lot of the flavors in the sandwich. The bread was a positive, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the in.  Basically this was a one and done for me. Im sure that they are well aware of how popular and busy they are especially next to the las vegas strip. More workers would definitely make the dining experience much more efficient and enjoyable.",

The sandwiches are a great price for what you are getting: crunchy bread filled with flavorful meats and lightly pickled vegetables.  Lee's is always well lit and clean with the best customer service.  There is so much seating inside and we noticed an abundance of posters of Hillary Clinton eating at Lee's at our last visit.  The cashiers are always helpful with recommendations and order clarifications.  My go-to order is the grilled pork sandwich with vegetables on the side when I am not eating it immediately.  I also like to order the other Vietnamese goods like the pate chaud and egg rolls, but nothing beats the Vietnamese iced coffee here! So potent and so good.    This place is consistent, inexpensive, and a great alternative to fast food sandwiches.  This is a guarantee stop whenever we drive through town on road trips.",

I waited forever for my sandwich and it was only slightly warm like they heated up in the microwave. The bread was really hard and super chewy. I got the grill pork sandwich but it felt like I was eating beef jerky cause the pork was so dry and hard. I wouldn't come back here if I wanted a Vietnamese sandwich or Vietnamese food. So I don't recommend coming here not worth the time to stop here or worth spending money for food that isn't freshly made.",

The French bread here is always a must have when coming here, pairing it with their signature ice coffee is like having a party in your mouth!   Another specialty is the Durian shake, if you don't know what it is its a fruit that grows primarily in Asia and is popular in the Philippines. You either live it or hate it but in order to know you got to try it!   I've been to the original location in Orange County as well as several other chains so I have a pretty good scope on most of their locations. This location is cool because it's 24hrs BUT it's not regularly cleaned, the tables and chairs are mostly dirty. The service around 1am is rather slow which is understandable considering less people work the graveyard shift. Other than that I will definitely stop by again during my latenight visit.",

The way we communicated, there was no way for to me ask if I could get my money back...nor did they offer to do any more because well, it's an Asian establishment and we all know how some Asians are with customer service - there isn't any.  Also, totally agree with Nelson Q's review, the Ice Coffee, the whole thing was filled with crushed up. like to the top of the cup where you have difficulty getting a straw in there.  ** head over to Pho Thanh Huong by UNLV - best sandwiches in town. sadly, they close at 10pm I believe.",

This place has hard bread, filling is kinda bare in the sandwich, the iced coffee should be renamed ice with coffee as my cup was done in like 3 sips (also the ridiculous price they were charging should be a crime), and the smoothies have no taste at all now with gummy boba.

Had enough Mickey Ds, Earls, and In-n-Out for the weekend?  Well come grab some Lee's. Quick, fast, not exactly cheap, not exactly delicious, but it will suffice.   When in Vegas, you know you're going to pay more than you normally do for food.  No, it's not the best Banh Mi, but if you're in a hurry and looking for a good portable to go food item, then Lee's should do the job.  I usually got the number #11 combination..in all honestly, I have no idea what's in it.. they always advertise it..so why not?  It's around $5 bucks for an okay size banh mi. Don't expect anything grand, just know you won't be hungry. I usually ask for more pickled veggies..which they charge $.25 for..and if i'm really hungry i go for an order of spring rolls too--a bit disappointing yes..but when you're hungover and hungry (since you were too drunk to make it steak and eggs the night before) the spring rolls actually taste decently refreshing. Plus that and the banh mi is easy to eat in your car ride home (or flight).  As for the coffee...if you already have a hangover and is sensitive to caffine..I would skip it. That stuff is strong..and yes you would get a bigger headache!  A few things.. Remember to bring cash, listen for your number to be called out, and don't complain..since you know what you're paying for..just eat the damn sandwich and be on with it. OH if you're lucky, they often give out samples of their other items.  So..1 star for being open 24hrs, good accessibility, and 2 stars for the food.",

They're open around the clock and at midnight we were craving some of that savory, pickled and fresh veggie goodness on a light crisp baguette.  What we got was strange spreads (not pate) on bread that had tough, chewy edges like it had been reheated by microwave.  We couldn't find cilantro on the sandwiches at all.  We both felt a little ill in our stomaches after eating which we deduced to be food poisoning or the feeling extreme disappointment.",

I've had the durian smoothie, but I'm not sure if they use the actual fruit or if it's just a powder/syrup flavor.   Don't get their, \"freshly squeezed sugar cane juice.\" It's nothing compared to the fresh ones found in LA. I got a large cup yesterday and it was disgusting. I let my mom try it and she said it might have been made with a powder mix. Regardless, they should get a better mix!",

The sign in the front for the bread being baked fresh was promising, but we got stale chewy bread that made it hurt to chew after a while....and I love chewy things like jerky but this wasn't fun. Got the vegetarian and the filling isn't really substantial and more like crispy bean curd crisps, rice crisps and the usual vegetables but it tasted good. I figured if I nuked the bread at home a bit it would soften it and it sort've did, but still very chewy.   To drink we got the honey chysantheum ice tea and it was still hot, with not enough nice in it....Funny, most of the complaints is there is too much ice. Too bad it wasn't good, it was nasty. It had a unpleasant back taste that was a bit like moth ball moldy grandma sweaters.    I see they have fro-yo and maybe late night fro-yo runs is ok, but I'm real leery now.",

No onions like they advertised and not the same with beautiful pictures on the wall. and we did not know what that is exactly. The meatballs are too sweet to me with A lot sugar. And the most terrible \"meat cut in the box\", which ruined my vacation night really. I asked the lady how long have been taken until now. She said just yesterday. But everything was smell and stickiness inside. Its cost 4.31$. I tried to eat some, and its nasty. I must vomit after some slides of something stickiness like shit. And my stomatch was stomach ache then. Im really frustrated with meat cut in the box. I throwed all away in trash. I promise I never back this place. The first time is the same as the last time.

This has to be the nicest and biggest sandwich shop in the world, it's so huge! I was there over the weekend, and the crowd was huge. I think I waited nearly half an hour in line. As always, their sandwiches are typical Lee's sandwiches that you find at their other locations. I won't say their sandwiches are the best in the world, you either love their sandwiches or you don't. They are a franchise and they use the same ingredients, so it does matter which location you go to, their sandwiches will be the same, (think McDonld). What sets this location apart from the others is the atmospere. This is the only Lee's location that has self serve frozen yogurt, a first for Lee's! The place is very bright and very clean(after all it's new). It is very conveniently layed out. It is also a nice place hangout with your friends. I don't know when was the last time I would hang out at a sandwich shop, but you can certainly do it here. I didn't get the chance to see the whole place because it was just so huge.   I was reading some of the other comments and it's like a broken record. I know, I know...your mom and pop sandwich shop down the street has better sandwiches. Like comparing McDonalds to a corner diner, sure the diner has better hamburger, but why do people keep going to McDonalds? You want better coffee?  then go to a coffee shop! You want better eggrolls and spring rolls, then go to a restaurant! If you want a place that you know will always be there, open and close at the right time, serve consistence quality food, and won't ask you to leave because you hang around too long, then come to Lee's !",

Darn, they were really good and cheap! I much rather pay Lee's prices for theirs versus Lee's. It's an insult to my last name. And I don't even own the joint. Enough said. But you might like it. Some people like it and think it is good. I just think it is a skinny sandwich, average at best. Sure they have the same ingredients that you find in a regular Bahn Mi but you can just go here or Hue Thai and it would still be the same or better and cheaper. What's it with me and cheap? Writing these reviews, I can't help but notice I keep saying good and cheap. Oh wait, those are the places I like. Nevermind.",

We ordered 10 special sandwiches, which cost about two quarters more than the regular sandwich. When we got the food, they weren't the specials we ordered, just the regular kind. Unfortunately, some of us had already taken a bite on the subs and thought that maybe we should just ignore the mistake and make the most out of what we have. However, my uncle insisted on exchanging them with the right ones because the difference in amount, when added together, is still a good sum of change (He paid and as a person, he's the type who holds on to every penny he can cz of the recession). Anyway, we had them exchanged but management just dumped the missing meats in the original subs we got (the wrong ones), re-wrapped them,  and gave them back to us without us knowing which belongs to whom. It was just disgusting and disappointing! I think they should have given us brand new sandwiches because it was their mistake for giving us the wrong order in the first place, and that is how good customer service should be. Obviously, my uncle did not let that slip and insisted that we got brand new sandwiches. It was one bad experience that destroyed the company's reputation altogether, and since then, we just never came back, especially my uncle who made sure that everyone, friends, families, and strangers, hear about that horrible incident.",

Once was bc they didn't get our order properly made, second time took 25 minutes with only 4 other customers in the store...not sure why that's considered busy...and this last time, they had no idea what macaron flavors they had.  They kept us waiting 20 minutes after payment to say they didn't have 2/3 flavors we ordered and wasn't sure what other flavors they had (why don't you write this down?)...They also handed us cold manjo even though I asked for fresh warm ones and the guy said he'll take care of us....crap shoot of a Lee's.  I wish I could have taken the tip we gave them in the tip jars all these visits back.  Also when I asked for a refund on the macarons, they gave us back the pre-tax refund.  Wasn't worth it to ask for the tax and have to wait again, so we didn't bother.  Bottom line: this Lee's sucks.  Btw only one of the entrance doors actually opens.  Not sure why.  Would not recommend this location.",

The chicken banh mi was good, but definitely Lee's club was better. More flavorful!  The texture of the bread still have not failed me. So gooooood!",

I told him you know health policy. And he just shook his head. Like he didn't care at all. Again I told him it was health Department policy. And that was the end of the conversation. I will be calling the health department on Monday. Really sad to see this because it's my favorite sandwich shop.",

Second time I went we forgot to tell the cashier we wanted the Asian combo at the beginning and instead mentioned it in the middle and he said \"you need to tell le they are combos at the beginning of the order\".

The coffee is classic Vietnamese coffee that you can make yourself if you're willing to buy the coffee, the strainer, and the condensed milk. It's decent Vietnamese coffee, but it's not anything to rave about.  The one redeeming quality is that the pate chaud is on point. The crust is flakey/buttery while the meat filling is substantial and has a good texture.  The parking sucks. Parking is already limited because of the sheer size of the lot, but it gets worse because there's so many businesses in the same area. Because of these 2 aspects, you either come when it's not prime time or you park across the street where 99 Ranch is and walk.  TLDR- everything is meh except for the pate chaud. Vietnamese coffee is decent but it's not something you can't make on your own.",

I thought it was pretty ok, hubby didn't seem to think too highly of it. Though he did eat his half quite happily.  So the next day we went back to grab a couple sandwiches and some Vietnamese iced coffee for our road trip to the Grand Canyon. Again cuz they are open 24/7 this seemed like the best option. We picked one special combo sandwiches and a pork meatball sandwich this time.  Fist let me say the coffee was absolutely delllllicious!! But you get a very small amount with the cup packed full of ice. It worked for us cuz we had already gotten some Starbucks before we headed out of our hotel.  As for the sandwiches, I liked the combo one (hubby refused to try it afraid it had hidden head cheese). But we both tried the meatball one and it was absolutely awful!!! Literally we each suffered thru one bite and threw it out.  So overall I'd say the sandwiches are ok....Iv def has many many banh mi before and these are average at best. And like I said avoid that meatball one! Oh I almost forgot we got a coconut waffle with our morning coffee too. It was yummmmy :)",

    "text": "I first became aware of Lee's Sandwiches about a year ago in San Jose, California. This one is a little different then the one in San Jose. And can't put my finger on it but it may be that Las Vegas is more culturally designed for tourist. Therefore it may carry over to the culture of the store. Not sure.   From what I see there are plenty of Asian patrons though coming into the store.   Lee's offers free wifi and is open 24hrs. There are also miscellaneous snack products on the floor shelves. The items are those specific Asian type snacks. (You the Americanized Asian sweats.)   As for purchase today, wonderful. The Pate Chaud was fresh and the iced coffee consistent as to the San Jose store. Nice and strong.",

    "text": "Let's start by saying it's better than average. What's better? The flavor of their coffee. It's dark french roast with chicory and sweetened condensed milk. The same syrupy milk used in tres leches cakes.  This style of coffee is commonly served with beignet in N'awlins. It takes a little more sophistication to recognize this because people think SBucks has good coffee. Wrong! 7-11 serves better tier coffee than SBucks. So learn a little something and go for the coffee.  They also make baguettes fresh in the store. This is the perfect vessel for your perfect sandwich.",

    "text": "It pains me to give them one star, but like some others on this review site, I had a terrible experience recently due to the staff. Every time I'm able to stop into Lee's I order the Asian Combo with a Chicken Ban mi. While the food has always been good, this last time I actually spent the rest of the afternoon throwing up due to the actions of the staff.  While I was eating in the second booth with my brother, a middle-aged female employee began mopping in the dining area. The mop REEKED!!! I can't even imagine the last time they had cleaned it, because it was just nauseating.  Not only that, she had no bucket of cleaner~ she was literally just pushing around this dirty stinking mop where we were all trying to eat.  As if that wasn't bad enough, she found a dirty spot literally four feet from our table, and her method of cleaning it?? Taking her shoe and rubbing the reeking mop into the spot half-heartedly. She stood there for a good 3 minutes oblivious to the discomfort of the customers trying to eat around that dirty mop. It was so bad I could not finish my food. I threw away at least a third of my sandwich (and later my boba tea) and we left.  After that I felt so nauseated from the smell that I was actually sick at home. It just blows my mind that A) the employee would think such a dirty mop (again, with no cleaner or bucket in sight) would clean the floor adequately and B) that she would be so OBLIVIOUS as to clean with it around eating customers.  I've loved Lee's up until this point, but I'm not sure that I can ever eat there again~ every time I think about it, I'm going to remember that dirty mop and being sick. Poor form, Lee's, very poor form.",

My BFF and I have been coming here for over 5 years and remember when they started charging for \"less ice\"... because we don't like super watered-down iced coffee. Well who dose?!? So management put up a sign and added a 50 fee. Then they raised the prices... I get it. Now, although expensive, we will splurge once in a while, and this is what we get!? The employees won't even explain why a quarter of the drink is missing, and why there's still the regular amount of ice! This is inexcusable and becoming a total waste of money! $6 + tax, and we can't even get a full drink, or an apology?!? Ahhhhhh!!! Upon asking the employee, he simply turned and walked away... in fact, right off to the public restroom while still wearing his cooking apron. Now I'm upset, unruly and ultimately grossed out all at once. We are done. Farewell Lee's Coffee! I used to love you! :( Now 'the people' and their incompetence have killed it for me! #RUDE #NeverAgain #BoycottBadBusiness #LeesSandwiches #LasVegas",

We shared the #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich and the  #11 Special Sandwich.  Both sandwiches tasted bland to us.  Nothing special at all.  Were there good things about the restaurant?  Yes.  The restaurant was clean, service was fine, and prices were fair.  Oh yeah, the Jackfruit smoothie was pretty good too.  I probably will not return here anytime soon.  Maybe another location in the future.  In Vegas there are many other places to try first before coming back here.",

They are addictive and unique in flavoring compared to all of the other sub shop offerings.    We went here for a few reasons. 1. It pleases everyone.  Even the more picky eaters in our group. 2. It's affordable.   3. We don't have one in our town.  We need one. 4. It was gonna be quicker than the other options mentioned.  This particular one seemed just like all of the other Lee's I have been in.  A little different layout, but basically the same.  Fast food style ordering and just barely longer timeframes than most fast food.  It did have some nice TV's though.   Service was the standard mildly gruff businesslike service I get at most Asian places.    I always order #16 and #1 and #18.  I especially like the pate.  I get it so rarely, I get it when I can.  The bread is the star on these sandwiches too.  Just perfect for what is being made.  Lee's Sandwiches has perfected Banh Mi for the masses.  Is it as good as fancy Banh Mi you might get at some restaurant for $10?  Nope.  But this is food for the people.    Head up though.  If there is a low carb eater in your party.  They may just not find anything to eat.  This place is packed with enough carbs to prep the Boston Marathon.",

The cashier goes about his business and doesn't say that he will eventually be with me, just goes about his business.  I ask how much something is and before I could get another word in, he just walks away to help another fellow behind me pay cash for some bread. I have a WTF moment as he let that guy behind me just walk in front of me to order and it wasn't even a quick order.  He just looks at me and doesn't say a word.  All I wanted was to buy frozen coffee.  My order would not have taken that long, and it would have been done rather quickly.  I don't know what I did to deserve this type of treatment. I've been coming here for years. So after waiting to be helped, and then left waiting again, I just left.  That sucked.",

See my Garden Grove review for info on specific food and drink (and a photo of a 1/4-full cup of coffee without ice... and a bag of ice on the side). One time our car was blocked in and we were unable to leave the parking lot due to TV cameras and \"men in black\" with their SUVs of black. Later found out it was because Hillary Clinton came to visit! We were feet away from her enjoying the fresh-baked bread, haha.  Came here a billion times while on vacation here and sick of paying exorbitant strip prices for food and tired of finding out all my authentic Chinese go-to places have closed down in the past few years. It is bigger than most locations with the exception of the also 24-hour Garden Grove location (my regular). One thing I prefer about this location is that they take card for purchases over $10. I don't remember if they have nighttime surcharges like Garden Grove but their prices are all generally higher than the locations in CA. But I guess that's the price you pay (literally) for being able to get real banh mi so close to the strip.  This strip mall is extremely popular and the parking lot is long, narrow, and hard to maneuver. It can be hard to find parking near the place you want.",

This restaurant is deceivingly large and a for good reason (it gets pretty busy). They carry a plethora of Asian drinks and the American standards. There's open windows to see the fresh baked breads being kneaded by large machines. I didn't get a chance to ask, but just left of the register they were making some type of small baked good from scratch, which is a plus.   The ordering process is simple for the most part, but because it gets pretty busy and the area around the counter is congested, you can loose your place in line if you don't pay attention.   I ordered the roast beef. Quality beef slices, lettuce tomato and mayo on a tasty croissant. The amount of beef given was fair but did leave me hungry for more, so if you go in with an appetite I would double be meat.   All in all it was a good deli experience and when in the area, I'll definitely return.",

The bun bao was a little dry, but I didn't mind so much since I don't usually eat the all of the bun anyway. The sandwich was very filling. Their bread is always cut longer than your normal banh mi sandwiches that you get at the Vietnamese delis. I saved half for the next day. Tasted just fine microwaved. Usually I'll toast it in the oven so the bread is crispy on the outside, but I didn't have access to one at the hotel. Overall, a good choice if you're looking for Asian sandwiches made with French bread.",

They also have the bubble popping bursting boba. I enjoy their Avocado smoothie, it is nice and thick and not icy or fake powder.   They have cute pastry that are shaped like fishies are corn and filled with cream inside. It is a great place to come grab something quick to eat or take it to go. The price are decent and are under $5 for a sandwich. They have a great seating area and they also have bathroom available. The parking can be challenging as it shares it with tons of other restaurants and businesses in China Town. However, its a good size store.   I highly recommend this Lee's Sandwiches for great tasting snack, lunch or late night eat. They have tv screens so you can easily know if your number is called and can get your food quickly.",

I don't have time to sit and wait for them to realize they've been skipping my number for 20 minutes. I spoke up & requested a refund because I have an order ready available for me at Starbucks, thanks to the convenience of the mobile app.   I spoke with Erick the manager who didn't really seem to care much. I told him his workers were standing around chatting while I was waiting. I probably won't be back unless someone else is paying. They won't get my money anymore.",

    "text": "Fun Fact:   In 1983, They started serving banh mi, Vietnamese style sandwiches from their catering truck by San Jose State University to the students and residents in the area. It became an instant hit among the community. Wanting to create a more permanent location and expand the franchise in over 3 dozen areas including Las Vegas and Henderson.  They opened the first Lee's Sandwiches location on Santa Clara Street.  In addition to the traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, they added Euro-style sandwiches, fresh baked baguettes and croissants, an extensive line of drinks including the famous  Lee's Coffee - ca phe sua da and can be expressed in regular, caramel, mocha, or vanilla blends.  Lee's Sandwiches attracts a diverse crowd, from traditional Vietnamese-Americans to a younger crowd, all ethnicities of all ages with the extensive menu that offers a unique dining experience for everyone's preference.   Lee's Sandwiches is heavily involved with the communities. They have contributed and helped raised additional funds for many tragedies including 9-11, Hurricane Katrina, the floods in Vietnam, earthquakes in Mexico, and other local charities such as donating food and sponsoring various community and non profit events.  As for my experience, I always utilize their space to do my college studies and homework in privacy because they stay open 24 hours and the owner is very supportive of my goals. I sit on the foyer part of the restaurant/ cafe so that I wouldn't take up space on the inside where people could dine. They also have a private room used for events. You can go in and ask if that room can be reserved.   What I love to order on their menu is #5 - Grilled Pork and #6 - BBQ Pork with extra mayo packets and vinegar on the side. This brings out more flavor and softens up my bread because that's just how I like it. To go with your meal, you cannot skip on their famous coffee. I love it because it's thick, creamy and keeps me awake when I study.   P.S. Just a heads up, plan on bring in cash to pay for your meals because they have a $10 credit/ debit card minimum to purchase a meal.",

They should have at least 2 people at the front counter.   I ordered 2 ice coffee which did not take that long to make and it was sitting on the counter & there were no one to give it to me, for almost 10 mins .  The cashier had a line of people waiting to order so she could not run to get the completed order out to the customer.  Every time it's the same, they will gladly take your order fast  but getting the order done is always been a bit of a wait for me at least.",

Not to mention that everything on the menu is more expensive than at the Lee's Sandwiches in Orange County. They are also stingy on napkins and the picked carrots for the sandwiches. Overpriced for what it is. Sandwich was decent, pate chaud weren't good at all (meat was too sweet).",

Nice looking place as far as a sandwich shop goes, similar to a quickie mart feel but bigger. Looking at the menu they offer a wide selection of items like croissants, breakfast sandwiches and the Bahn Mi. I ordered a grilled pork bahn mi and a roast beef w/cheese sandwich. It took almost 10 minutes to get the roast beef sandwich which I can't understand since the grilled pork was ready almost right away. The bahn mi was good but about average for what you can get elsewhere. Other than the slowish service its priced right and its open all night so I have another option for late night grubbin after work.",

Our order took about 10-15 minutes to come out, but everything was correct and delicious! The coffee tasted good with nothing added.  The fresh baked rolls are delicious and for $3 the Bbq pork hoagie is such a great deal. I love the tender pork paired with the crunchy carrots and diakon with a hint of spice.  The turkey hoagie was typical, but tasty nonetheless.  We probably could've shared one and been satisfied.  I couldn't finish mine, but the fiance was more than happy to help! We will definitely be going back!",

The atmosphere is pretty cool and the place is huge, you're guaranteed a seat. You won't miss your order, unless you forget your number or loose your receipt, because they have a robot on speaker calling out your number throughout the whole place.  Well, I've always gotten a combination sandwich and I get mine at a local Asian market bakery down the street, so I was expecting something just as good. Well, for two combination sandwiches it took about 30 minutes for our order, kinda ridiculous. As soon as I picked up my order of my combination sandwiches all I noticed was small portions of everything. I didn't even taste vegetables or the spread they usually put on it. I guess it was an okay sandwich but I've had better. Also, I wasn't even half way done with my sandwich and the roof of my mouth was all scratched up from their bread. I thought maybe if I had some hoisin sauce or Sriacha it would help, first off they didn't know what hoisin was when I asked for it, second, they gave me a little cup of Sriacha good enough for two bites and they said they only could give me two. Great. I was not feeling this place at all. I guess I should go give it another try & try something else but for their prices, I could just stick with my Asian market's bakery.",

    "text": "I definitely got my Asian sandwich craving fix here during and after my pregnancy. As usual, I ordered the bbq pork sandwich. It was great and reminded me of home. They had a lot of stuff on the menu including European sandwiches which my husband enjoyed. From steam buns, to thai tea, boba drinks, coconut waffles, and packaged snacks, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants lunch in china town. It was pretty cheap here if anyone wants a cheap lunch. You do get a lot for your money.   Customer service was great. They were friendly, fast, and efficient. They got my order out in five minutes or less even when there was a rush. They have a lot booths and it's fairly spaced out. It's not hard to find either, considering how compact Chinatown is.   I do see a lot of bad reviews in here, but it's definitely a place people should check out at least once. I just wish they had something like this in North Las Vegas.",

Upon arriving I looked at the menu and didn't see anything that had really caught my eye. They have a variety of Asian and European sandwiches, I got the vegetarian that has a variety of veggies and a yummy sauce I'm not too sure what it is. The only thing I really didn't like is that they don't let you use your card for orders under 10 dollars and neither my cousin or I had cash so we had to combine our order which makes it inconvenient when thinking you're just going to pay for one meal.",

When I looked at the pictures here at Yelp, I was worried that it would be super busy with long lines. Luckily for a Sunday it wasn't. The hobby group I'm in only occupied one table and a few more chairs near the doorway against the glass window.   I liked how it wasn't just a small eatery but it also had lots of prepackaged snacks and sweets.   While there I ordered a regular Caramel Smoothie with boba ($3.49), and a Steamed bun with egg and chicken inside ($1.99). I didn't get to eat the steamed bun because it was big and hot (Currenly in my fridge the day after I got it). The caramel smoothie with boba was ok but it took a while to get. I'm glad that they have the number system because without it I would have forgotten about it or wouldn't have heard it on the PA system. Would I go again? Sure! With a lot of choices in sandwiches and etc there's still plenty of things I'd like to try.",

    "text": "TLDR: 24 hours; $0.25 surcharge between 9p-5a; $10 minimum credit purchase; bahn mi and euro sandwiches  Lee's Sandwiches in Las Vegas? Why wasn't this thought of earlier? This restaurant prides itself on euro-asian sandwiches, but boasts its foundation from Southern California. There are a couple of differences between the ones in SoCal compared to the one here in Vegas so I'll share my experience below.  There is a quarter charge for purchasing after 9pm. WTF. Really? This just makes me laugh. Anything to get by in this economy I guess. I would've just restricted the menu to save money in that regard. I purchased the same thing I always get: #5 Grilled Pork Asian Sandwich and it's a whopping 710 calories according to their website. I enjoy the combination of flavors from the mixed, pickled vegetables to the cooked meats. The roof of my mouth often gets scraped from the hard bread, but I guess I can just take smaller bites.  My service late at night was generally positive. The communication between the foodservice workers need to improve, but generally a smile during the drunken hours goes a long way.   All-in-all I would return. My experience was not spectacular, but it was consistent. I would recommend, as long as you can get over the smell.",

I ordered 2 bbq pork bahn mi, a special combination bahn mi, and a lee's coffee. The cost is around $18. I asked the cashier what was in the special combination bahn mi and he had no clue, he was nice enough to ask someone to tell us what's inside there (head cheese, jabon, pate), well I never had any of those interesting meats (I did not like the after taste, I'll stick to bbq pork). My love and I decided to go with the usual but try something different as well. We both took a bite of the special combination (props for those who can handle this taste), with the bread scraping against my gums and ripping my skin off, I already knew my bahn mi was not  going to be good.  I usually expect my bread to my bite-able, but no. BBQ pork had a off putting taste to it. I don't know, I felt like I had food poisoning after an hour of eating this meal. I will attempt to eat at my usual spot and let you know how it goes, but as for lee's in china town. I do not recommend.",

I was really impressed with the price and the size of the sandwich.  This was my first time at this chain.  It was about a foot long for about $4.75.  You can't beat that.  Even at the usual Banh mi shops, it's a 6 inch sub for $4.  So, this was a good deal to me.  The bread was on point.  It was fresh, crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  The filling was alittle skimpy but if you consider the total size of the sub, it's not bad.  The filling i.e. meat and pate were nicely flavored.  Tell them to put the jalapeno on the side..   They had a great grand opening promo (poster on the door) where you got free Viet coffee with any sub purchase! STEAL!  A foot long sub and Viet coffee for under $5 is an amazing deal!  You gotta ask for it.  I noticed people around me didn't get the same deal.   I was disappointed they didn't have the Viet coconut waffle.  I love those.  They said they didn't have any batter left.   I noticed they had pate chaud  (French inspired Viet meat puff pastry) but I didn't want to have left overs b/c it was already midnight and I had a footlong I had to inhale.   The Viet coffee was from a premade mix rather than made to order but it was free and we're in Vegas...we were craving the caffeine.  I noticed this was a common practice in Vegas with the other Viet restaurants we visited.  What happened to the single serving coffee drippers???!!!   I liked sitting in the shop eating.  They had interesting snacks for sale and it was a very big and nice shop.    LOVED that it was open 24 hours.   Cashiers were friendly even at midnight.",

But I guess either massive inflation hit or because this Lees is in Vegas...   $4.50 for the number 1 special! That's nearly $5! What is this? A Vietnamese subway?! Banh mis are known for their value... Cheap eats, usually a banh mi would cost you like $3 or even buy 2 get one free... It might be this location? But if that's the price, Lees sandwiches have gone up.   They also don't have nem anymore... But they did have cha lua and if you buy it they give you a loaf of bread... Great deal but you're paying $6 for cha lua... I guess I'm used to paying $1-2 less. Maybe it's this location... We made a pit stop to eat breakfast and got some sandwiches for lunch. It was okay...",

    "text": "I used to come here before I discovered where to get the perfect banh mi to my liking. I knew it was ahhhite, but would come anyway because my mouth would long for that banh mi experience. In HI, I used to go to Bale...it was worth scraping the roof of my mouth for.  Okay, back to Lee's. It's fun because they are 24hours, the offer an array of banh mi's, and serve other items I haven't bothered to memorize. They do sell other items in their refrigerated area if you are one of those out-of-towner who is looking to take something back.   Honestly, my experiences with their banh mi sandwiches were....my sandwich was skim, and my bread would be in pergatory somewhere. Pergatory, meaning...wasn't quite toasted and wasn't quite cold. Then other times...I wasn't sure if it was stale or overly toasted. But how could that be possible considering I've gone on nights where they are in baking their french rolls. Perhaps I should've requested a fresh roll, but I don't like to make a big ole deal especially if we're talking about a 3 dollar something sandwich.   Anyway, I wouldn't stray someone from coming here. I'd point them in a different direction first, though. But if you wanna come in and try it out...go ahead. They aren't that bad at all especially if it's 3 in the am and you find yourself desperate for a banh mi.",

Tonight I decided to stop by and buy a baguette to have with dinner. After I Order I told me that their card min is 10 dollars. I didn't have any cash so I had to leave without getting what I went to buy. I had just gotten off work so I wasn't really thinking straight and completely forgot that I've purchased thing for a lot less than 10 dollars many times in the past so I called them and ask them if I could pay for a 4 dollar item with card and they said i could. I don't know what was the reasoning for the counter person to come up with the card rule on the spot but next time I'll just pick another place to give my money to.",

    "text": "Lee's Sandwiches is definitely the place to get your snack on. It's located in a shopping center in the middle of Chinatown, which most of the time, sucks driving in no matter what.   Lee's is definitely a go-to at any time of the day simply because they have affordable food that's a little above average in quality. I usually come during late night hours after work or class because it's not really busy and it isn't too pricey to break the bank.  The interior is bright. There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing. It literally looks like a scene from iCarly or some other show on Nick LOL.   Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.  I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!  If you don't want to drive all over Chinatown for decent boba and cheap snack-like food, then Lee's has got your back!",

I ordered and was charged more than the menu price so I questioned why, she told me because I ordered a large.

In fact, it just tasted like milk and sugar. Tons of sugar. My friend disliked his thai tea as well, TOO MUCH SUGAR. The reason why I find it so sweet is because my regular boba spot is Tea Station, and their lychee snow is JOYGASMIC.  I will say that I loved the sandwich I ordered, which was bbq pork. I don't mind raw onions and the spice, it was good. My phone picked up wifi there, but it does require a password. I didn't inquire about it since I'm not there to surf the internet.  My friend also ordered beignets- now beignets are basically french donuts. Fried dough. WTF LEE'S. You come up with mini sweet pita pockets. When you bite into it, it's just.... empty. I really don't know if I'm going to go back. The place is so pretty at first glance, but it's a huge mindxuck.  Oh, I forgot to mention. Yes there's plenty of space to sit down. But it's not like anyone wipes down tables or clean the floors. Every table had at least some crumbs, and the floor under the table we sat at was so dirty. Shoe grime. Didn't catch it until we finally left. Blehh. =/",

How many times have we all rubbernecked while cruising down Spring Mountain only to see the place still under construction?  I ventured in around lunch time and the place was packed. Fortunately efficiency is one of their strong points at Lee's so before long I had my grubby hands on a #11 Special Combination. And then, the disappointment. The bread was a little dry, the pickled veggies a little bland and there was not enough mayo/pate. I don't expect the best sandwich when I go into Lee's but I do hope for a decent one.  It did seem like many of the workers were still in training so let's hope the quality improves in the coming weeks. I'll be back again soon.",

I've given this place a few tries, but each time I've been disappointed. The meat in the banh mi is almost nonexistent and has a rubbery texture, like it's been sitting out all day. The bread is stiff and hard all throughout when a well-baked baguette should be soft on the inside. Service isn't all that different from a fast food restaurant, you get in line and pay for your order, then they call out your number. I haven't tried their American style breakfast sandwiches, but if they can't even make their Vietnamese sandwiches right, I'm scared to taste their American sandwiches. I'd rather take my money to Hue Thai or Dakao.",

The day after the purchase, we realized they had a buy any sized Asian sandwich get a regular-sized coffee free promotion since August 9th. We had purchased 2 Asian sandwiches, and the cashier asked if we wanted a large-sized coffee without letting us know of the promotion. Thus we were charged full price. Even though we could have gotten 2 free regular-sized coffees, she took advantage of our ignorance and purposely led us to believe buying the large-size was the better deal.

I've come here after work, shoots you'll see me at any given time throughout the day.     The quality of the sandwiches, the freshness I've grown accustomed to from Lee's is there.  Apply the sriracha and your tastebuds are in for a ride of enjoyment like few others out here in Vegas.  And let me be the upteenth hundredth person to tell you their fruit smoothie bobas are magical!  The frozen boba perfect in this mildy hellish place we call Vegas during summer.

I wonder if they think I'm so blind that I wouldn't see that 90% of the cup was ice. The taste was good but really a rip-off for what you get.

I had just come to peace with Lee's because they started accepting credit cards, and I enjoy their iced green tea. However, they have raised their credit card minimum to $15, and we made the chilling discovery that if you order \"light ice\" they pour the exact same amount of beverage. This means that you receive a glass that is 3/4 full. This is in the top 10 most ridiculous business practice I have witnessed, up there with charging a quarter for tap water...crap, I probably just gave Lee's another idea.",

    "text": "Sooo came here after work (11pm) craving a sandwich and Lee's is both close and 24.  Two people, two sandwiches, one a European combo (they also have 'Asian combo' option which serves 2 egg rolls opposed to chips) and one single sandwich put us out $13.   Positive: -Open 24/7 -The Turkey, Ham and Salami sandwich on the baguette. -Dining Area (spacious with options and wi-fi) -Baguette's (worth mentioning twice, for sale individually) -Nice variety of Asian and European sandwiches -Awesome variety of drinks too; smoothies, all sorts of coffee drinks, Asian Teas and Boba available. -Those fun, different Asian snacks that you may find at a cultured market, the international isle, or may see at your local Japanese sushi restaurant.   Cons: -Our breakfast croissant was greasy (equivalent in price but 1/3 the size to our meat sandwich) and could not stand up to a Starbucks breakfast sandwich enjoyed the day before, which is frozen and then microwaved ingredients.  -Soda Machine behind counter: Whenever I see this I know I am dealing with a cheap, cheap owner / a money hungry establishment. Why? The food cost is all in the cup, the cost of the cup much exceeds that of a second round on fountain soda and should realistically be available for seconds / refills as a service to customers dining in a restaurant.   -Service suggested staff was no where near a happy group of individuals (excessive sighs, long exhausted stares, disgruntled and impatient tone, with overall disorganization)  -Wait time 10 minuets. Okay so not great, but still acceptable. Probably just seemed too long because we were tired and got our hopes up being number 12 after they called number 11 and then 10, 9, 8, 7,12 ? Okay weird but whatever.  -What I cant get over, the biggest con: a DIRTY DIRTY restaurant. Every booth was disgusting with dirty paper napkins and or cups and each also covered in crumbs. Floor was littered with straw wrappers, cups, and dirty napkins as well. Saw the same staff member walk through a disgustingly dirty area and not attend to or mind the mess. The establishment had 4-5 people visible and working and there was frequently no line. If said staff member had the time to circle around aimlessly, why not wipe the tables, or gee I dont know, sweep? It was obviously not overseen in a rush but a demonstration of poor systems and practice of staff. Bathrooms were dirty too.   Would I visit again? Yes, food did not blow our socks off but wasn't terrible, wouldn't mind exploring the options and beverages on menu, Somewhat of a bargain if you know what to order (aka not anything on a croissant) and hey what can I say, even I get dirty now and again, I hope my second trip will be to a more manicures restaurant, because we don't like to eat dirty now do we.  Decent food, 24 hour sandwich spot, loses a star for service/soda machine and one star for cleanliness, or lack there of.",

I couldn't think of any other reason than trying to relived the past, but those days are over and i rather support our local store than a chain.

    "text": "There are a few amazing things about Lee's Sandwiches that needs to be pointed out:  1. 24 hours. 7 days a week. 365 days a year. All day, errrrday, baby! When the UNLV library closes at midnight and the 24 hour Starbucks joints are all full during midterms, Lee's is a great alternative as a study spot.   2. Iced coffee. A little disappointing because it's literally a cup of ice with a side of coffee. But no joke, this stuff is super potent. Ice will melt over time and the coffee will still stay strong and won't taste watered down. Condensed milk goes into this so for ya'll lactose intolerant people, pop a Lactaid pill or avoid it altogether.   3. Snacks. They have a good variety of Asian snacks. Sweet, salty, crunchy, candy-like...you name it, they have it. They're a little hard to ignore since they're staring at you while you're waiting in line to pay.   I was a huge fan of their sandwiches when they first opened. Bread was always warm and soft. Ample amount of meat and veggies. But sad to say, it's no longer like this. The last sandwich I ordered, I felt as though I was fighting with the bread just to get a good bite. Hard, stiff, stale bread ain't my thing. I ordered the veggie sandwich and it got me scratching my head wondering where all the veggies were! I usually really like their pork and egg steamed buns too, but wasn't too appetizing during the last visit. More bun, less pork/egg concoction.  All in all, I would recommend this place. They need to bring back good quality sandwiches though. Then this place would be fantastic.",

    "text": "Lee's has been a chain I've heard about from natives of Orange County, but I had never been to a location until I went to the one in Vegas' Chinatown.  My friends got some banh mi, steamed buns, and Vietnamese coffee. I ordered the combination banh mi and my hunger was sated. Nothing stood out or was overly special about it. Their bread was on the squishy side. I heavily prefer the freshness of the ingredients and crisp bread used in the sandwiches from Dakao. The Viet coffee was pretty bold and strong, but provided the needed caffeine fix. They fill the cup completely with ice, so there's not a lot of coffee, but the stuff packs a potent punch.  At the time, we thought the food was pretty decent. That is, until a while later, they ended up feeling queasy and one friend had stomach pains. It was enough for us to throw the remnants of our food away immediately. No question.  First time at Lee's ever proved that it'll be my last for the Nevada locations.",

We were helped by the woman who takes orders who kindly described a lot of menu items. My wife and I split the BBQ Bork and Grilled pork Bahn Mi's. My grilled one had a lot less of pork than the BBQ one but both had excellent flavors and the bread... Wow! A perfectly baked baguette with such a great flavor and perfect crunch to it. It's a place you smell like well after you have left which can be a good or bad thing.",

    "text": "Figure I give it another try.  It has been about 2 weeks after my first visit.  Probably, it was the opening week jitters.  This time around, there was not much of  a line.  There were only 3 people in the sandwich shop.  We ordered the Banh Mi - special combo and an ice coffee.    With no rush whatsoever, it still took them over 20 minutes to get us our orders.  This is quite shocking.    Once we received our orders, it was another disappointment.  The Banh Mi was pathetic.  Hardly any fillings... a few thin slabs of meat and hardly any veggies and pickled carrots/radish. Bread was cold and hard.  Obviously, it was not fresh.  It concerns me that it was definitely made sometime earlier in the day.  If this was the case, why did it take so long for them to fill our order??? Did they forget?  Go figure... I should not be surprised.  As for the coffee, where is the coffee??? It was like 90% ice and 10% coffee.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me for trying this place again.  Never again.  Bad food, bad service, and overall bad restaurant.  By the way, how the heck does this place get an average of 3 stars?  It seems like the owner or their henchmen is putting 5 stars on this place to boost the yelp ratings (note:  you can kinda tell... most of their \"5 star ratings\" have only \"1\" review to their name).  Sheesh.. how cheap is that.  If your restaurant suck, don't try to Falsely advertise your failure by boosting your yelp rating..    Obviously, the management does not have their priorities set.  They should focus on fixing their restaurant and producing a quality product.  Otherwise, no one will return...",

Its not the best, but maybe it is just the location here in las vegas. Me and my friends also miss that one girl who was cashier. I havent seen her all week, so im assuming she is gone because i used to see her all the time here. She was cute and had a great personality. I wish a lot of the cashiers there were like that. The music they play is repetitive and loud. It makes it difficult to tell them what i want to order. I noticed they have been putting on different tv shows on their tvs lately too. The only downfall about this place is that me and my friends found hair in our food and one of our friends got food poisoning. Talk about health concerns. Its an alright place, my favorite thing there is their pate chauds, coconut waffles, and their passion fruit juice.",

Unfortunately it's more an essence of Vietnam vs the real thing. Cafe sua da didn't taste strong, nor fresh and of the pastries we had none of them were Vietnamese in orgin - rather tasty but not the real thing. We avoided their banh mi as my sister-in-law thinks their bread is hard and they are light on the meat/vegetables. So overall it beats the alternative at  11pm at night but go to a real mom and pop Vietnamese place during normal hours and skip the corporate knock off.",

However, this one in Las Vegas (Spring Mountain Road), didn't even have spring rolls, rice plates, etc, and only had some small pastry dessert inside.  The store itself is really clean and big, but I don't even know why they have such a huge store if they don't even sell a lot of items.    The customer service is also bad.  We ordered three sandwiches with extra vegetables and hot peppers.  The sandwiches were made and placed on the rear counter behind the register.  I had to flag down the cashier to tell her my sandwiches were ready for us.  Then when we opened up the sandwiches, all there was inside was the meat.  They put all the \"extra veggies\" in a zip loc bag and basically told us to add the veggies to each sandwich.  Lazy ass fools!   Go somewhere else and save your money.",

The sandwich was tasteless.  The bread made it taste better than what it really did.  They just pulled the bread out of the oven and it was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

The Iced Coffee is still as good as I remember it. The Banh Mi Thit Nuong wasn't anything special. The bread itself didn't have a good buttery taste. The good thing was that the bread wasn't not overly toasted that my teeth break as I eat the bread (this has happened to me before). The cashier lady wasn't the friendliest but it'll do as long as my order is right. Their register is very modern in that your order and price appears in front of you as they enter it in. The awesome thing is Lee's is open 24 hours but they do have a slight nominal fee when you order during the wee hours. They also don't take credit if your order is under $20.

It's open 24 hours, and the entire place looks like a gigantic cafeteria. Bright lighting, plenty of seating. The night I came in with my friends the place was nearly empty, so no issues with finding a spot.   We had the cream puffs and the sugar cane drink. Cream puffs lacked taste, as I felt like the cream in the middle really wasn't anything significant or tasty (the cream was just \"there\"). I do have to say the sugar cane drink is worth giving a go, since it's sweet but not overly sweet to where you get sick of it halfway. Otherwise the pastries and the bite of the sandwich my friend got wasn't anything special. Also, I always seem to think places who just offer cash as a paying method is behind with everything else technologically in the world unless it's a family business.

Thit Nuong/Grilled Pork Banh Mi - Lacked the flavorful grill and sweet flavors that vietnamese grilled pork usually has to offer.  It also seemed like there was only 3 skinny pieces of meat.  Very lacking in filling as with other Lee's experiences. 2.  Special combination (sliced jambon, head cheese, pork roll and pate) - this was more enjoyable for me because it had the nice flavors of all the sliced meats but the hard baguette held me back from devouring the way my hungry tummy wanted to. 3.  Cafe Sua Da / Iced coffee - super icey, but I can't say I hate the flavor.  Just lacked the volume.  It few slurps and it was gone. 4.  Nuoc Mia / Fresh Squeezed Sugar Cane Juice - wayyyy too sweet, like  unnaturally sweet.  Conclusion:  3 solid stars for excellent effort, but not higher for just mediocre banh mi.  Please, frequent the mom pop's of banh mi places like Dakao for much better banh mi.",

I went in and this place is pretty big and there are a lot of people. Despite this, the wait in line was really quick. I ordered a Turkey and cheese sandwich. Took about five minutes for my order, and when I saw it I was disappointed. There was only the turkey, cheese, tomato and some mayo in the sandwich. There were onions, a pickle, mustard and jalapeno on the side. For the taste it wasn't anything special, I could've made one like this at home....I am disappoint!   And for a place like this, I was even more disappointed that they only accept cash, weird because they had an atm machine also in the store. I won't be coming here soon, seeing as this place seems to be working out it's opening glitches. Maybe in a few months.",

Not too Bad but far from great.  #5 Grilled Pork: slices of pork were bland, I think the medley of veggies and herb were tastier?.. I like the BBQ Pork better, it has a little more flavor.  Pork and Chicken Egg Rolls: Both missing flavor but I'd take the pork over the chicken  Iced Vietnamese coffee: Strong, Sweet and quite tasty. This should wake you up!  The highlight of this place would be their Bread. Their Bread is pretty good much better than what they stuff in them.... If your looking for quantity over quality for a budget price, then this place maybe your solution!",

    "text": "2.5 stars!?   I've been to the one in Irvine, California since I went to undergrad there and loved it!! I was ecstatic  when this one opened up locally! I think this will be the next subway =).   I must admit that I was discouraged when I yelped it and it only returned 2.5 stars. Anyhow, I decided to go see for myself and this place BIG!! LED TV's everywhere (march madness anyone?), great ambiance, very clean and modern design. Probably the nicest Lee's. The line was a bit long, and i was expecting to wait about 30 mins from reading other user reviews but it took about 5-10 mins which was decent  given the amount of people there. I ordered the Ham and cheese croissant and an Iced coffee. The Ham and Cheese was huge and delicious. No complaints there. I don't understand why people are complaining about the iced coffee...It's the same at all the Lee's. It's VIETNAMESE iced coffee. It's condensed so the ice is meant to melt and dilute the coffee...duh. It's not meant to be gulped. Maybe the Iced coffee should come with instructions ha ha.  Never the less, the coffee is very addicting. I ended up buying one of those bottles that you can keep in the freezer so I can drink it through out the week.   I haven't tried one of those fresh made pasteries or the patay sho thingy's. I'll try it on my next visit.   Free WIFI is always good. I'm Planning to use it as a study spot since it's 24/7! whoo hoo!  I wish it had a drive thru.  I see a frozen yogurt bar opening up in the near future!   Overall a very nice place. I hope it's safe to study there at night. Is there a security guard!? ha ha",

Prices went up higher and seems as if the sub I got  was not worth the money   I asked what the most popular one was I think it was combo #11.  I really still don't know what I ate. Seriously there was some funky meat I had to take off it was so chewy and tough. Actually looked nasty!  I love the veggies they put on the sandwich. The turkey sandwich looked pretty good. I guess that was not too bad.  Bought some of the end pieces of the rolls they sell for only  .99. you get a nice size bag. The only thing with that is you better eat fast cause they get hard and stale fast!  The bread use to be a lot better. The outside had a crunch and inside was soft. Always super fresh. I don't know why but it just didn't taste like the bread was just made.  We did get the coffee again. That is still amazing!  A little expensive with so much ice in it but has an amazing flavor.  Not sure if we will come back anytime soon. If we do I will for sure make sure I know what I order. I don't even want to know what that meat was. Lol",

Sure, the quality of ingredients is laughable, and sure parking is entirely impossible at any reasonable hour of the day - but you don't go to Lee's for organic free-range rBST-free cage-free kosher halal panini-pressed-by-god-himself sandwiches or for valet services. You go there to get cheap food that fills you up and makes you feel like an old Vietnamese grandmother just reheated every strange, delicious precooked delicacy in her fridge and filled your belly with them. It's wonderful.   In all seriousness, the banh mi is very underrated here; the pate is largely flavorless (probably from sitting out for the last few decades) but it's nice to see that they even include it. The bread is a solid French roll, the meat is sweet and tender, and the inclusion of cilantro is a welcome callback to what the sandwich should be. And it's four bucks. Go get one.",

I have watched this place go from an always crowded hang out and fun spot to grab a drink or eats - to a barely surviving business.   Part of the problem may be the arrival of other businesses which have spring up since Lees first opened here in 2013 ?  Places that are nearby and have better food better drinks better prices.  I have seen the quality of employees go down over the years , and the speed of service is very slow . Many of the tables are wobbly, and many of the pastries that used to be always available are now not available. They seem to have weird rules that don't make sense . I asked for the little custard pastries, she said all she had left was eight . I said that's ok. I only want 4 . She said I had to buy all eight .  I ordered a thai iced tea and asked her to go light on the ice . She said it was an extra charge for going light on the ice .  So to summarize. If this was the only game in town , it wouldn't be a bad place . But with so many nearby options offering better variety , better pricing and friendlier and quicker employees .. I can't justify coming here unless it's past midnight and everything else is closed.",

I liked how they have a combo meal where you can get a sandwich, egg rolls, and a Pepsi.  The egg rolls were average. I tried the xiu mai banh mi and it was pretty good.  My husband did the combo meats and he liked it.  It's a pretty big sandwich.  Bigger than your average banh mi and the bread is different too.  I think they make their own breads.  The coconut waffle was really good.  I loved it.  They make it right in front of you.  The banh bao was average.",

The bread and everything was good but their flavor lacked. Think it's their \"pate\" like they didn't put enough or enough didn't even have a nice flavor. And their peppers were  too spicy to handle. The best \"banh mi\" to get is the Dac biet (combination) and thit nuong (lemongrass pork). Other than their sandwiches tho, they are know for their famous Vietnamese coffee. It is a crazy rich creamy style strong coffee. A flavorful experience that I'd definitely recommend. It's also a great mix with eating a sandwich. They have other snacks leading to the register in hopes you bite in to their teases. Not full \"lee\" satisfied but I'm sure their sandwiches will consistently taste better the more you go because everything is made fresh and made to order. Lastly, it's open 24 hours!!",

It is pretty big and spacious for people to eat and escape from the hot outdoor weather. The best part is the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. The juice is warm because it's freshly squeezed from the stalks, so stir the liquid up and enjoy the sweet, refreshing sugar cane juice. The sandwiches were tasty, but the baguettes are a bit softer than I'm used to. Still thoroughly enjoyed every part of my meal. They do charge for extra veggies, so I didn't get it. It is great for a Lee's in the desert. If you want your banh mi, or DELICIOUS Vietnamese coffee, pandan (green) waffles, the custard filled fishes, random Asian snacks, just come here. :) One stop for it all!  There is a bathroom inside. Parking is shared with all the neighboring stores/restaurants. I was able to find a spot, but it was super crowded. I took the first spot I saw.",

And you can tell this group of workers are younger but they need to know what's appropriate and not.. and it took forever to just get two coffees.. no one was helping the poor girl up front.. shame this place used to be so good in customer service",

They are probably my two favorite things to eat, and probably the only decent option if you are hungry in the middle of the night with only a few dollars left in your name.  Haha.  Lots of seating areas available and they have restrooms available for the customers.  I wouldn't say it is the cleanest spot I have visited, but it is not anywhere close to being labeled as \"dirty\".  Yea, expect bread crumbs on the tables if the staff didn't get a chance to wipe off the tables before you use them.  I always order their Special sandwich, and their iced coffee is amazing.  But it annoys me that the iced coffee are so expensive, but I guess you just have to bite the bullet if you need that extra shot of caffeine to make your drive back to wherever you came from.  Oh yeah, be aware of loud obnoxious drunk people loitering around during late hours.  Hahaha.",

This was however my first time at this location and I loved how open it was when we first walked in! They have extra seating away from the main restaurant area and it's furnished with plants and Asian inspired animal statues. I went with my Vietnamese mother in law and was told to touch the frog for luck! In the main restaurant they have your choice of seats and booths, drink fridges to help yourself and cute merchandise against the wall. The screens also show all their drinks - they have their own boba drinks too now which I haven't seen before! Aside from the coffees, we ordered a BBQ pork banh mi and a combination and they were both delicious!! The bread was warm and soft but crunchy on the outside. There was a good amount of meat in both and the veggies and the sauce inside were a great complement to both. I was so impressed and would definitely stop by here for some lunch and my beloved ca phe sua da again!",

Still... in general, I've had mostly good experiences here, and the prices are decent.   I like that it's next to Golden Tiki - perfect for when you need a little bit of  food to balance out the booze. And after a tiki drink or three, it's clean..enough.

When they were only around $3 I would buy alot and bring them home to share with the family but now it's almost $5 for a sandwich. That's ridiculous for a banh mi. I always get the special combination banh mi and ask them to toast it up or warm in the microwave. Yes, it's suppose to be a cold sandwhich but I love when it's warm because the bread is soft and the pate/mayo get really creamy. Try it next time! My bread was hard. It wasn't from toasting it because I asked them to warm it up 2x and it still wasnt war! The bread was really stale. Now I'll just the banh mi from where I live $3.25. Just not the same bread/pate but still amazing & creamier!",

The fried springrolls were delish as well. If you love Vietnamese coffee, you need to buy their concentrate version. It cost a little more than the one already made but you just need add it to some ice and a little water. you can make 3 or 4 cups with one container of their concentrate.

I'll give an additional star for the nice employee who took our order, and the fact that the rest of us got the correct items, but the wait and inconsistency of following service protocol (using the machine to call out numbers when the full order is ready) is ultimately going to chase away many customers (and stars).   Come here for the name, but expect to be called out of order even if you all ordered the same item. Don't expect any consistency in wait times regardless of the amount if customers present.",

I haven't tried most of them because I'm always too full to eat anything more, but the ones I have tried are delicious. This place is not on the strip but is pretty close to it.  Their lee's coffee is a favorite. It may be too sweet and strong for some, but if you let the ice melt a bit, it tastes perfect.

    "text": "Don't put out coupons if you don't want to honor them...that's what I call BAIT & SWITCH. The picture below shows a perfectly valid coupon from Valpak. The first time I tried to use this BOGO, I tried showing it on my mobile device, but Lupe (the cashier/night-time supervisor) said it must be printed out. Fine, but the coupon could be more clear and say \"must be printed\". I returned a few nights later with a \"printed\" coupon and got another cashier to accept it. I also got a digital punch for their Epoxy Loyal Program. Lupe witnessed this and then scolded her cashier to not allow for punches to be given when a BOGO is used. I returned a third time last night. Lupe was the cashier, and once again, she refused a perfectly valid coupon. She said she was just following the rules and that I can contact her manager Benito. When I finally spoke to him today, he told me that I was abusing the system  by trying to use the Valpak coupon in combination with their Epoxy stamp (Customer Loyalty Program), and that he had me on video. So now I am the sandwich criminal! Their customer service is a joke...instead of just giving me a lousy $4.00 sandwich, they are just jerks about it. I understand that some coupons say \"Not to be combined with any other offer.\" I don't think asking for 1 Epoxy stamp was unreasonable since I was still technically paying for 1 of the 2 sandwiches that I would be getting with the coupon, but if that's against their policy, I can totally understand. But, that isn't reason to just ban me from using the Valpak BOGO coupon. They just have to politely say that I can either use one promotion or the other. FYI, there are many other restaurants that will allow me to use a coupon and a loyal stamp/punch card. It's not a big deal.",

    "text": "After living in the Bay area for 6 months, I was aware of Lee's Sandwiches as a chain. But somehow I never made it in to visit. I was pleasantly surprised to see their familiar store fronts when I relocated here- and finally swung by this evening for dinner.  Pricing and variety are good, with both European and Asian sandwich options- I chose the #6 bbq pork, and added on a 5-piece order of hot wings for $3. Not bad at all. Total order was under $8 and even though signage is posted about $10 minimum for credit cards, I was not hassled.  As I waited for my order, noticed several other menu items I'd consider coming by for in the future: steamed buns in a warmer by the front counter, various Asian grocery store snackfoods, and cold coffee drinks available with boba- yum!  Order was up quickly, sandwich was gigantic  (10 inches!) and wings were tasty. Considering they were \"hot\" wings, flavor was not spicy at all, but they were not bad. Sandwich was large enough that I barely managed to eat half of it, though a good inch and a half at each end was just bread and no filling. Way too much daikon was on my sandwich, giving it a mostly sweet taste with no attempt at balancing flavors- bread and sweetness overwhelmed.",

I ordered my usual turkey baguette, with a Thai tea and I was really turned off this time. I found an actual hair baked into the baguette. What's even more sad, is that I continued to eat the sandwich and tore off the piece of bread where the hair was because I was that hungry. (Ehh some people have it worse). The tea was not that great either, it it had a weird overly robust flavor, definitely not as good as it used to be.  Overall, I probably won't come back to Lee's unless it's the one in Henderson since they seem to have better reviews.",

Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced \"Imported from France\" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.",

    "text": "When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally...\"empty\".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?",

As far as the place, it is spacious, well lit, and clean considering it is open 24 hours. For those unfamiliar with a Vietnamese sandwich, you kind of have to know what to expect and/or go by recommendation as to what to order. My favorite would have to be the grilled pork banh mi. Many friends of mine like the Special Combination because it contains a variety of meats, but I'm not too fond of the pate inside. Their wide selection of beverages is perfect to quench anyone's thirst, I personally love their Italian sodas. While I've never had their frozen yogurt, it adds another thing they have available.  Also, BRING CASH if you don't plan on spending the $15.00 charge limit.",

So I asked her if I could just order the second one she missed, she said okay, and took my order. BUT WAIT. No more boba. She seemed so dismissive and annoyed. Then when I asked if I could just wait for a new batch, she said something in Spanish to her coworker and said I could if I wanted to wait 30 minutes.   Amazing. Purely amazing. Your complete lack of customer service is so welcoming. Your urgency to make a sale and retain customers is definitely providing you with a thriving business.   So here I go, on my way home, with no boba... :'(",

    "text": "I love the vietnamese sandwiches, but the downside is that the bread they use is always hard . So when I take bites I take hard chews of all bread and end up eating most of the meat last. Their bread is good, tasty, and soft when it's fresh. I wish they would serve the freshest bread for the sandwiches too! Their thai tea boba is deliscious! Milky, smooth, and sweet! Just the way I like it. They also have free wifi and a very contemporary feel to the interior decoration.   If you're looking to get a kick start on vietnamese lingo, I'd suggest to hang out at this spot and learn about the numbers in vietnamese! Their service machine calls out your ticket in english and vietnamese! So when you're hanging around lee's definitely count with the service machine, and I guarantee you you'll be a vietnamese counting guru with in minutes!",

As my first time, I wasnt sure how to order but thought it would be a great sandwich based on the pictures. It was ok...baguette was fresh but not hot,  or warm. It was bland for a grilled pork sandwich.  The pork was not hot or warm. There was little sauce,  little veggies,  meat....lets say it was skinny. Anyway,  I'm sure I won't be back unless I want a skinny,  dry, grilled pork sandwich on a not so hot baguette.  Still, I ate it, so it gets 2 staaaas...",

    "text": "Lee's is one of the best places for sandwiches and bahn bao (steamed buns) in Las Vegas. Vietnamese food in general is an acquired taste, and you must also apply this to these sandwiches. With that said, the food here is amazing and has such a unique taste. The sandwiches are a pretty decent size and you are rarely left hungry after just one. The employees are always extremely nice and helpful if you don't fully understand what you are ordering. While the line can get pretty long (because it's popular), once you have ordered it is a fairly short wait. Furthermore, Lee's is open 24hrs, so you can get your cultural grub on any time of the day. I usually eat here about once a week. My favorite thing on the menu is the bahn bao (steamed buns). These are amazing. I typically get the pork and egg or the BBQ, however, they also offer a chicken, egg, and mushroom bun. I highly recommend eating here. If you are skeptical give it shot. Definitely get a bun and maybe split a sandwich with someone to give it a taste. I hope you love it just as much I do.",

    "text": "March 13th, 2011 marks the opening of Lee's Sandwich, an popular Vietnamese chain from California. There was a lot of hype for Lee's to open and I never had Lee's before so I was curious to find out what all the fuss was about. Is it really all that and a side of a pennyworth drink?   Lee's Sandwich is open 24 hours (or \"always\") and is CASH ONLY. The man whom seemed to be the manager says it may be a permanent thing. The restaurant is pretty big, there were tons of tables, and it seems to have a modern look going on (think Yogurt Land). Oh speaking of Yogurt Land they also will be serving froyo (frozen yogurt). At the time of my visit the yogurt machines were not up and running yet. If you aren't into yogurt thats okay because they also have che (Vietnamese desserts). Aside from that they have a decent variety of baked goods(Deli Manjoo 5.89/20 pieces) and baguettes ($0.99/each).  Nowww onto the sandwiches. I saw the price ranges of $2.99 to $3.89. I must admit there were a lot of choices. Each sandwich comes in a 10 inch baguette that is baked fresh each day (baguette bag says every 30 minutes). Traditional banh mi flavors were available such as the combination and grilled pork. European sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches were also available which by the way seems really weird to me to have a roast beef and turkey sandwich made in the same place with my jam packed daikon/carrot cured pork sandwich. Anyways my grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich was somewhat bland, the bread looked like it was gutted out, and felt like a lack of authenticity. I know that its a franchise, but the sandwich I ate does not deserve the name of banh mi and should only be referred to as a Vietnamese sandwich.   Today was also the soft opening so if you are going within these next couple days expect some delay and kinks. I must of heard \"sorry we're out of \"insert item\" \" at least 4 times for 4 different items. At one point I heard that they ran out of milk, one of the most essential items for them to make their coffee.   I will probably stop back a few more times to truly gauge my feelings about Lee's Sandwich, but at this moment I rather get something from Mr. Sandwich/Hue Thai or Dakao.",

    "text": "I was soooo looking forward to this place opening.  Had heard friends from cali say good things about Lee's... and the thought of banh mi 24 hrs a day had me constantly checking it out every time I drove by, wishing....hoping.... that it would finally open.  Then they finally opened for business and I never went....  lol.  I saw what seemed like a lot of poor reviews on Yelp and just never got around to trying it out.    Well... leaving my buddy's place late one night and a bit hungry, I finally decided to give them a shot.  Who knows.... maybe it'll be delicious, I thought to myself.  I was thinking a lot of the bad reviews were probably just from the super snobby Yelpers....the ones for whom nothing is ever good enough...lol.    Well... sad to say, the poor reviews were well earned.  There were 5 people working there that I could see.  Three taking orders by the cash register.... which seemed like overkill, seeing as there were about  10 people in the entire place....half of which were already eating.  1 guy making sandwiches, and 1 guy pretending to push a broom around.  I place my order, as did two other small groups right behind me, and grab a seat right next to the pick-up area.  The guy making sandwiches was pretty quick and had all 3 orders (a total of 6 sandwiches) done in less than 3 minutes.  But then they just sat there on trays.....  while 2 people stood by the cash register doing nothing, and another walked by the finished sandwiches about 5 times so she could talk to the guy sweeping.    Hmmm...  I wanted to just walk behind the counter and grab the stuff myself... but whatever... I was kinda curious just how long they'd let them sit there.  Eventually the guy who was \"sweeping\" finished up... and as he left the dining area he handed out the 3 completed orders...   So as far as service goes....  not impressed.  But hey, if the sandwiches are amazing... I don't really mind all that much.  Eh, what a let down.  The bread seemed a bit too hard and crunchy.... and although it looked like an adequate amount of meat and veggies were inside...  90% of what I could taste was just bread.  Again....not impressed.  Hue Thai / Mr. Sandwich are much better.  Sure they may be $1 more per sandwich, but it's worth it.  Heck... I'd much rather go get a $5 footlong at Subway then get a couple sandwiches at Lee's.    You know I really don't like the place when I give it 1 star...  I mean seriously.... I even gave Clark County Detention Center 2 stars.",

    "text": "First of all, this Lee's Sandwiches here in Vegas is no where near any comparison to the one in the Bay Area. This place was all hype and no deliver!   The first star is for being \"always\" open, late night cravings and or ready to eat food is a good thing about this place and Free Wi-Fi!  The second star is for a decent special combination Bahn Mi sandwich, it's not close to the one I've had in the Bay but it's enough to satisfy the hunger. Also, the star is for the exceptional Vietnamese spring roll that they make fresh and their Bobas that comes in a variety of flavor.  The other food that they offer are all ok, the chicken wings were kind of salty and their fried spring rolls (lumpia) was just dry. The bread that they use are made fresh, however by the time you get it and take a bite, it's a little dry already. The place offer other tasty food as well like their breakfast sandwiches and other pastries, but all can't be compared to how good i remembered Lee's back in the Bay.  As far as the workers, they are not your typical asian servers, because most of them are either hispanics, blacks and some whites.I've been to this location more than five times already and some of the workers are just rude and loud. However, there were some exceptional servers that were very friendly and attentive to your orders.   Overall, this place is a miss! I thought after anticipating it's grand opening that it'll be a hit, no it's more of a disappointment. I only go back to this place cuz Mr. Sandwich down the street close early and they really do have good drinks (iced coffee, bobas, smoothies).  Oh yea, as a plus their music playlist is up to date! They got your new hip hop, pop, r&b favorties in the mix lol. Be aware that the commercial they play for the iced coffee can be a little annoying!!",

If you have shitty bread, it doesn't matter what you throw on it, you're gonna have a bad sandwich. The bread here is good, really good. A nice crusty on the outside, soft on the inside bread. The toppings could be higher quality. I feel like I could probably make an equivalent sandwich if I had their bread, but I'm in chinatown ordering a salami sandwich. I really like grabbing some egg rolls or an Italian soda with my lunch. If you're on the fence about this place, stop by and grab a loaf or nine of bread. You won't regret it.",

My first impression on entering the store is that there is a smell, a bad smell, that lingers the entire time you're in there. You would think after a few minutes you  would get used to it and wouldnt notice. Not here in Lee's.  If that wasn't bad the smell followed us all the way to  home while the sandwiches were in the car. We seriously had to roll the window down. I thought I was being  dramatic until my co-pilot stated she was refusing to eat hers for fear it tasted like it smelled.  I was able to venture in but wasnt wow'd. The bread was ok but the meat was skimpy.. even for  most bahn mi standards.   Meh... kind of sums it up perfectly..",

They are like a lot of boba shops with the same kind of food and drinks. Their boba isn't cooked as long which is why I know a lot of people don't prefer their boba that way but I enjoy it! The one thing I'm not too fond of is their bread used on their sandwiches. Depending on what time of day it is, towards the end of the night, I usually get really hard pieces and eat on the insides of the sandwich. Service takes a while, even when its empty. Their card minimum is $5 so if you're only trying to get something small, bring cash with you.",

Last time I had a Viet sandwich was when I went back home to Dallas.  I was expecting the meat to be thinly sliced and layered on (like most of american deli's- Subway, etc) and plentiful of vegetable that are either chopped or julienne.  But overall I left semi full and sad; the bread was stale, deli meats were a bit tough to chew and overall the fresh taste of the meat, soft bread and the fresh, crisp sandwich vegetable wasn't there.  I've seen this place packed and everyone seems to eat the sandwiches with hunger delight but it just wasn't there for me.   And it's a cash only transaction venue was a bit of a turn off.  I may have to continue to look for another Viet sandwich places to fulfill my appetite.",

I loved you in Orange county...Your iced coffee, you little custard corn shaped filled pastry...Your dessert \"Che.\"  You've been open in Las vegas for oh...I guess at least 3 months now...I expect more from you having the history I do with you!  I use to go down to Orange county from Northern California and make it a point to stop by a Lee's for their great coffee and desserts.  There is one literally on every other street corner there.  Despite not accepting CREDIT CARDS, I would grab cash on the way just to stop by you.  What happened in vegas?  I know it takes business at least three months to settle in and offer consistent-tasting food. Its been that long yet I still am not a  fan of your sandwiches, vietnamese Ice coffee or pastries as I have been for at least 6 years now.  To the newbies, your sandwiches might taste good, but honestly, you have no consistency with your sandwiches.  The veggies are good but sometimes I don't get enough.  The bread is also very hard if you buy it to go and not get to it for a few hours.    Readers, if you are familiar with myself, I love love coffee.  i love Vietnamese coffee even more.  The first time i walked into this place 3 months ago, the girl behind the counter asked me how I wanted my coffee because she can make it specifically to how i wanted it.  WRONG! Lee's coffee is generally pre-made, when ordered, it is just simply poured over ice.  There is a specific recipe that goes into making this drink.  The next few times they got the clue and had it pre-made.  Unfortunately, this coffee still lacks the taste that I remember receiving time and time again when ever I visited SoCAL.    Because this place is family owned and operated, I would think that at the least, my coffee would taste as I recall it for many years.  I am sad to say that this Vegas location is incomparable to its sister locations i SoCAL.    If its a late night and I am crazing my coffee and sandwich, I'd stop by.  Otherwise, I go to Hue Thai or Mr. Sandwich.  Please Lee's, Get better soon.     Sincerely your customer, TTK   PS: Pro's: One of the biggest locations I've been to, If you camp out, no one would notice.  ...That's about it.",

Wife and I both had smoothies watermelon and strawberry both with boba.  We both enjoyed our smoothies very refreshing.                  We had a chicken and grilled pork bahn mi .  Both sammies were dry needed more mayo, meats seemed pre cooked to me.        Disregard the Hot fresh bread sign they have , i think it is permanently on , bread was not hot or fresh.         The positives  :  Dining area very spacious and clean!!!       The reason for second star bathroom was very clean and not the single person bathroom , I expected when I first saw the door. When I opened the door I really said \"wow\" .  I would give it another star  just for the bathroom ,, but did not want to mislead people who don't read reviews , but just go by star ratings.       If you get anything from my review it's this , if you have to go potty in Chinatown , Lee's is the place!!!  If you see me at Lee's   I probably just came to use bathroom.",

They do serve Deli style sandwiches but why do that when you can have something different. And the price is right = $3.39.  I am a former General Manager of a Steakhouse and I KNOW that if the owner is taking care of the little things, more than likely they have already covered the Big things. You can see by the cleanliness of the restroom = Ice in the Urinals!! That they are on the ball. I like the dining room also with the Large screen TV;s and the big over sized booths.

I ordered the #11 special combination and the spring rolls. But they were out of spring rolls. Really? Uhm, you can make that easily!  I got my sandwich, the bread was deliciously warm. If you wait for the bread to cool down, it gets hard and you'll have a hard time eating it.   So bottom line, go when hungry and during brunch when lines are shorter.",

That's difficult when you have to get back to work. Maybe they need to staff up at peak times.",

My first impression when I walked in was is this even a Vietnamese establishment. Not that one too judges book by its cover. Sure they had small section selling Vietnamese products from candies, dry goods products, baked goods, and beverages. It felt more like american chain sub or sandwich shop.   I had the grilled pork sandwich or thit nuong. The same one last time had one but this was in Sacramento area. Not as though not close because my grilled pork sandwich had all the condiments that traditional. The spring of cilantro, sliced jalapeno, the carrots and believe daikon, and if there was anything they did hit on point was the bread. The bread was perfect hot, fresh, crispy outside, and great bread. They place they feel short for me. The grilled pork lacked flavor for me, portion size could have been bigger, the sauce or spread inside not fan of, and when combine everything together nothing Wow or get excited about. My dad who visiting order the combination sandwich. Not sure the types of meat in it but not fan more so then grilled pork sandwich.   Really if looking too get Vietnamese sandwich not the pace too go. I know I was disappointed.",

The only thing stopping me from giving over 3 stars is the lack of customer service by the cashier. I ordered my food to-go, yet my sandwich was handed to me without a bag. I had to ask for a plastic bag to carry my sandwich. Also, the cashier took the order of the person behind me in line; that was very off-putting for me. My sandwich came out much later than usual, which wasted my time. I'll still probably visit this place, but less frequently due to the service.",

    "text": "Whenever I go here my usual is the #4 Grilled Chicken. For those that are noobs, its like pho but in a french baguette without the broth. I referenced Bruce Lee because they also put fresh sliced jalapenos in it. So if you arent expecting it, watch out! Gives you a really good kick to your taste buds!   If you are not sure what to get, just get whatever every body gets by default when they go here for the first time. The #1 Combination. It has a lttle bit of everything in it. Well, not everything but if you wanna play it safe, this and the grilled chicken are safe picks.  For those that dont find the baguette sandwiches appealing, they have huge croissant sandwiches. Yes, they have European sandwiches. Not sure why they would have these because they are a Vietnamese sandwich place but it is good! Now these sandwiches are much more tolerable if you dont wanna get surprised with what is in them. You have choices like roast beef, turkey, and ham just to name a few. Im not gonna go over every little thing they serve cuz otherwise you will be falling asleep.   They also have nice appetizers like hot wings and spring rolls along with a whole list of different flavored smoothies. Dont forget to throw some boba in there! Oh, also did I mention they have frozen yougurt as well?  Last but not least, a lot of people also get the ice coffee here. I have tried it myself and I gotta say, it does have a lot of flavor plus the caffeine you crave! Prices for the coffee are a little bit less than Starbucks which is a good thing.  NICE RANDOM INFO: Its nice that they are open 24 hours so if you got the munchies at 3 in the morning, you are set! Free wifi! You just need to ask. I think last time it was their business phone number. Last but not least, if you are there long enough, you can learn the numbers 1 to 99 in Vietnamese!  BAD RANDOM INFO: Just recently they started taking plastic but there is a minimm of a 20 dollar purchase. They should of just kept the cash only policy because if you dont have any cash than you have one of two choices. 1. Purchase more food than you planned. 2. Get money from their ATM which leads to more fees not only from the machine, but from your financial institution as well.  So every now and then, a trip to Lee's should be ok, hence the 3 stars. For more info on the rest of their menu, go to their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.leessandwiches.com&s=254c7b55a1bd5ea20af10a0798c8fd8a78eebff8b66c45ca3423ddd53a9977b5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">leessandwiches.com</a>",

The place is huge but so little snacks or drinks available. The pate spread isn't tasty. The staff here were not friendly. The Vietnamese coffee isn't the best that I've drank (too sweet). The grilled pork was too dry and the vegetables pickled were so sweet.",

I just wish they would put more meat in their sandwiches so I'm not hungry again in 1-2 hours after eating here. Would recommend them as a good snack spot if you're in the Chinatown area because the food isn't filling enough for a full meal. But for $4.25 a sandwich, you can't go wrong!",

I went again today to give it another try and got the bacon ham egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on a baguette and again it was just like warm, no ham and it was only halfway full.

I got in line and there was another customer in front of that ordered a lot, which is fine. Their order was going to take forever and they were in front of me so I wasnt mad. I ordered my thai tea with boba (which is okay, not the best but I definitely have had worse) , and waited. 20 minutes later, the customer in front of me and I were still waiting for our order, which again he ordered a lot so I understand. I looked over and the thai tea was just sitting there while they work on the larger order. I went ahead and ask if that was order number something and she said no it wasn't, so I was like that's not me then. Another 20 minutes later (that's 40 minutes combined now) and they finally got the order ready for the customer in front of me. By this time, both of us were already annoyed by the time we waited. Then the server grabbed the thai tea, the same one I had asked her about, and called my number. The tea was watered down from the ice and it looked sloppy. Long story short, I was pissed, but I said nothing in case it's another 30 minutes to make a new one, and drank some of my tea before I threw it away. So no, i would not recommend this place.",

Now granted I'm only visiting the area, had a bunch of mediocre food on the strip the day prior and came here early in the morning on a Sunday where most folks in the Vegas area visiting would be recovering from hangovers.   Damn good stuff. The flaky pastry with meatball was served hot and fresh. The bahn mi had enough crispy on the outside and hot while the meat was tender and had a crisp exterior. The coffee was generous, and tasted fresh out the brew.   I think this place is a definite stop by for every time I'm in Vegas now. It was also nice to see the crew with nothing else to do prepping for a big day, cleaning up the place and making it look as flawless as possible.",

From what I remember, this place was tolerable for 2 hours then it got frustrating with the homeless and back & forth with customers.   Its gotten even worse now. Now the wifi is locked nowhere to plug your device, an annoying small door to walk through in the middle of the main entrance. They opened a second door for people to come in, but left the second cramped door? If your trying to say that the first door is for entrance and the second for exit then it's poorly done. I get the middle door is, perhaps, for security reasons but you have glass for walls. Whoever wants to go inn can. Then why have that annoying center small door? It makes no sense.  Aside from that, customers seem to have gotten far more louder than before. You guys are right next to each other, why on earth do you have to yell for? Now I define have no reason to return and spend my time there.  UPDATE... NO MORE WIFI. ITS PRIVATE NOW.",

I've been to the ones in Los Angeles  County (since its my home region), the one in San Francisco, and now this one in Las Vegas.  The baguettes used in San Francisco were too mouth-cuttingly dense, so eating those was an adventure of its own. However, in Las Vegas, the baguette is firm, but easy to eat. The menu wasn't very clear as to what certain items had, which is a bit different from the menus of the other cities. However, the personnel were very friendly and helpful. I know! I should know what's in each sandwich if I'm a Lee's Sandwiches fan, but I'm also a UX Designer, so I'm a bit nitpicky about accessibility.  Ordered two Combination #1 banh mi, and they're good. Two whole sandwiches at barely $9-something... if you're on a budget, this is a great bargain! Hell, if you did Combo #11 where you can one sandwich and a Viet Coffee, it's barely $5-something--- total bargain!",

The sandwich I ordered and paid extra for bacon, did NOT have bacon and there was 1 piece of turkey on each cut half of the over sized croissant. There was absolutely nothing great to say about this sandwich but way to much bread definitely not enough topping on the inside and you forgot my bacon.  The dessert pastry things were good and they were fresh and still warm. Only reason for the 2nd star on my review.",

They're always open, which is a plus when we're craving late at night.   Their Vietnamese coffee is the best! It will for sure wake you up, and mind you pre-work out doesn't do me justice like this coffee does. Neither can any boba place match up to the caffeine power Lee's Viet coffee has!  Lee's aways has been and will always be our go-to!",

We always stop here to grab a sandwich (my favorite is the combination), it's absolutely delicious, fresh, toasty, flavorful and yummy. I could easily eat 2 sandwiches by myself, it's seriously that GOOOOOOOOOD!!! Another popular item that they have there is the Vietnamese iced coffee which I love so much. It's so tasty, you all should check it out, I promise you won't be disappointed. I also love their sugarcane drink, they make it right in front of you. It always tastes so fresh, sweet and great. I usually order a few large cups to bring with us as walking around the strip when it's hot.  I always grab a whole bunch of other snacks like sesame donuts, coconut waffles, croissants, macaroons...etc. They are so yummy!!! The place is always busy so I wait in line for a bit to get my order. The place is clean and they have free wifi as well. There are tables and chairs where you can sit and relax and enjoy your food. The only thing that they need to be improved is their restrooms, it's very dirty.",

It's not just how obnoxious the exterior is, with the ultra-strong lights that probably drive every insect in a ten mile radius to the store front, or how unnecessarily large the place is - but it's the mediocrity of the food and the stinginess of the restaurant that really just earns it a low, low rating.  Their baguettes are ho-hum, the amount of meat per sandwich is underwhelmed by the pickled veggies, and while the price is great I'd much rather go to Mr. Sandwich and pig out there.  When I say stingy, I refer to their iced coffee.  I love Vietnamese coffee (strong Vietnamese coffee individually dripped with condensed milk and it's delicious and nom nom nom and really should be a dessert), 70% of that cup is ice, the rest is yummy Vietnamese coffee.  Want more?  Ask for low ice and what do they say?  \"Sorry, pre-measured, I'll have to charge you twice.\"  Seriously.  I'm paying three bucks for three slurps of coffee?  I can go around the corner, go either side to Pho Kim Long or a five minute walk and get some Vietnamese coffee for a full serving!    Their spring roll looks like it had two shrimp and some real veggies in there.  It's allll laid on the top with the shrimp sliced in half.  So it's nothing but filler.  Where's the taste?  I was informed that they used to have really great food in California about ten years ago.  I dunno what happened, but wow.  However, I will give it to them - Interior is super squeaky clean, modern, and ultra-bright, as I mentioned, as well as 24 hours.",

Their coffee is still full of ice, but it's so delicious and I got a free one because I had a coupon that I saw inside the Las Vegas Weekly in the dining section.  My ten or more two star experiences and this five star bring me to a three star for Lee's. Their wifi is always open. I guess there won't be much they can do now about the lack of outlets, but there's always great reception.

The smoothie I had, though, was more ice cream and sugar than fruit, like it seemed to be advertised.  There's no table service here, which is perfectly normal for a sub place, but I've had better subs elsewhere, and way better smoothies elsewhere, as well.  If I come back, I'll have the sub and skip the smoothie.",

I was getting my nails done down at Sahara when the guy who does my nails got into a conversation about Chinatown and all the spots he likes he mentioned this place and he said they had the best ice coffee. When someone tells me something is a 10 I know I have to investigate! So after getting my nails done my boyfriend and I go he orders a smoothie and order a large ice coffee. Coffee was a 10 it had crushed ice and the coffee was rich and thick. I want to try the steamed bun next time and a baguette. Will be coming back to Lees sandwiches.",

It's perfectly sweet, but strong. I've been going here for iced coffee for a while, but I still have to dilute my coffee with water. You can honestly make your coffee last a while if you just keep adding water.   You can purchase the concentrate frozen in the cold case & one frozen bottle can make 3 servings of iced coffee for about $6. They're in the cold case towards the left of the restaurant.  Every time I go to Vegas I have to go to Lee's because i've yet to find a better iced coffee!",

Yes the flavors aren't superb but I can definitely deal with it! I like how the sandwiches are skinner! Makes it easier to eat then the regular thick baguette used for the banh mi like other restaurants. I like it bc I have TMJ (displaced jaw joints) which won't stretch my jaw muscle that wide. They don't put a lot of meat which is fine for me. Like I say it's Vegas late night food okay? They do sell other items besides the sandwhiches! Ohhhh and I'm in love with their Viet iced coffee! What I noticed is that the wrappers for the sandwhich have the name/type of meat you get so it can help differentiate the sandwhich for everyone! We order 6 so to have the name of the sandwhich on the wrapper helped ID each one. Located in Chinatown so parking is okay bc a few restaurant open late night as well.",

The warm bread is soft yet crunch enough without being too hard that it'll scratch the top of your mouth. That does happen with certain places that serve banh mi because of the type of bread the use. The chicken isn't so grilled, which I expected a darker more grilled chicken. The chicken has enough flavors and combined with the veggies, mayo, and herbs, it's okay. Not the best banh mi around I'm sure.   The cashiers don't seem to be very welcoming. In order to use a credit card, your purchase will need to be $10+. This place is open 24/7 which is great for those that are hungry in the middle of the night. Overall, this place is okay.",

Not sure when they have fresh and warm French rolls for purchase, but I do know that they are good as I've had it before since someone brought it to a wine tasting.  My favorite is Banh Mi sandwich number 11 and the red bean sesame balls. What I like the most about Lee's is their bread and how they're open 24hrs.  They have Vietnamese iced coffee, iced Thai tea and many other selections.",

We had some time to browse (since the line moved slow) so we grabbed a couple of small snacks as we stood there. The menu is pretty big and they do have a lot of different drinks to pick from.   My friend ordered a honeydew green tea with boba and I had a lychee iced peach tea.   The cashier was friendly but she definitely looked overwhelmed. She told us they were short on people and that there were only two of them working that Friday night, hence the longgggg wait.  Our drinks took about 10 minutes and they were placed on the counter for us to pick up from.  My peach tea was good and just what I wanted. My friend didn't like her honeydew green tea as she said it was too sweet and tasted like medicine.   The inside is big and there are a bunch of tables. I did leave with a stomach ache though, because the inside smelled like what I think the inside of a dirty toilet would smell like, yuck..   I definitely would not be able to eat here with that kind of smell..   Smelly location and slow service, hmm idk.",

I did notice when I get it that it wasn't really stuffed. What I did enjoy was the bread and also it came warm. A panini press and some cheese would make this perfect:) I did like it but would never get this again.

Had no time for that but being open 24 hours, I returned another time at 630am and was served immediately.   I live near the Henderson location on Eastern and have dined there maybe three times and this location twice. I always have ordered the 5 & 6, a grilled bbq pork and bbq pork. The sandwiches are consistently amazing from store to shiny store. The bread, fresh with a crunchy bite that's softens easily with each delicious chew. The veggies are fresh with bursts brightness from the cilantro, crunch from the fine slivers of carrot and heat from the raw jalapenos. The meat is juicy, Smokey, sweet, tender and perfectly seasoned. These two sandwiches are scrumptious and satisfying and the chip selection is eclectic and on point. I chose a horseradish kettle chip. Their beverage selection is equally diverse and delicious from domestic sodas to a variety of coconut waters and flavored teas.   If you're ever unsure about what to order, I highly recommend the 5/6. Surely to impress your tastebuds and five senses.",

    "text": "Dissapointed. I went at 3:30am. The plaza they are in is always busy with a lot of my favorite places. I kept trying to remember Lees as I have seen it hustling at various times. I decided to give it a shot.   Let me get the poor part out of the way & save the good part for the end of the review. Not very clean feeling walking in, poor communication from staff to cook to customer. Didn't even know my number to be called was on the receipt. I will say she did ask if I wanted a paper bag & remembered to put napkins in the bag. THAT IS A PERSONAL 5 STAR. (big pet peeve when places don't ask & worse don't put napkins or tell you napkins are located over...). So really just more communication & don't let the customer expect, just tell them it's going to be 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 7 minutes etcetera. The sandwiches that did come out looked good but more like the pretty bakeries that don't really bake well. I would go back & try it again if that helps at all. Ok now to the positive part.   Moving from Miami Beach I can honestly say I felt like I was at a Cuban Bakery. Except a Cuban Bakery is a 10 compared to this. I was hoping for more Asian Cuisine. It's definitely just a sandwich place. What i got was delicious & is the reason I provided 3 stars. I got spring rolls which was not what I was expecting. It was shrimp rolled with veggies & I was expecting more of an egg roll (spring roll). It's ok because I'd go back just for that. Unfortunately I ate it too quickly to remember to snap a photo.   I also got a Binh Ban Bun. I think that is what it's called. Omg it was delicious! I wish it was a little more fresh than when I purchased it but they werent making any more for the night. Again, delicious. And worth the trip over there.   Overall it just wasn't a great customer experience & for me it's all about the customer experience AND the food. Thankfully the food I purchased was good.   Itll be a little while but I will definitely be back. Thank you.",

    "text": "This place has gone down hill. On our last visit a couple days ago, we walked in and my poor boyfriend almost fell hard, but he caught himself on another patron's table and bumped an elderly woman's shoulder.  The culprit was water on the floor that was not wiped up. I had to notify an employee who saw the whole thing, but didn't take initiative to clean up the water spills, until I pointed it out. He then had no choice but to clean it up.  Second, the same guy took our order, and was not friendly at all. You could tell it was a \"bother\" for him to take our order. We had one question regarding the menu about combination number 6 and 11, he rolled his eyes as if we were asking him about the entire menu!  Third, as we are done placing our order, we decide to look for a place to sit. I kid you not, every single table was dirty and needed to be wiped up! Also, the floor was dirty with food debris and dirty water floor marks from spilled liquids! You could tell they had time to do it, but they were just being plain lazy! We had to pick the \"cleanest\" table and wipe it ourselves.  Fourth, our order was ready and was sitting on the counter. The cook calls it out for the order taker to call us. The guy is too \"busy\" daydreaming. I got fed up and walked to inquire about our food, the cook notices me and just decides to go around from the kitchen and give me our food instead of the other guy. I then told the guy that the order is for here. The other guy finally walks over to tell me, \"oh we don't give out trays, but I guess we can make an exception\"...really dude?!  Fifth, we are eating and the place is not busy and instead of them cleaning up the tables, they just do nothing about it...ugh!  This experience really ruined it for me to ever come back to Lee's. I use to love coming here, but not after this. The owner should do a surprise visit, to make sure this is not an ongoing thing, or it was just an \"off\" day.",

    "text": "Wow this place is huge. Looks like they got more selections than some SoCal locations I've been to. We stopped by here before driving back to CA on Friday after Christmas. I didn't get anything (knowing the traffic we had to face ahead lol) but my friends all ordered their coffee. One friend is a regular lee's customer, so she knew to order with LESS ICE. The rest were ordering for the first time, so they were disappointed to see the 80:20 ice-coffee ratio lol their coffee is pretty strong tho.. one of my friends let some of the ice melted to water down the coffee cuz he thought it was too strong (he's a Starbucks regular). So yeah.. if you can handle their coffee, make sure to ask for less ice. Otherwise it's not worth it. We didn't get to try their sandwiches cuz we had late buffet lunch before coming here, but this is a chain eatery so I'm pretty sure their food tastes the same as the ones in CA. I honestly like their baguette.. they use rice flour so it's more crispy than the French one x) Oh and they also have deli manjoo here. My friends love them.. I think it's okay but then again, don't mind me.. (I don't have sweet tooth like the rest of em lol) they made them there, so you get to buy them when they're still warm :) and they also sell other drinks and prepackaged snacks.  Whatelse.. oh restroom is regularly cleaned.. and umm parking can be a hassle during rush hour or holiday season. Hmmmm maybe I'll be back if I happened to be in Vegas and craving for some banhmis. Lol maybe. (I'm pretty sure Chinatown has better banhmi tho.. I mean there's a banhmi eatery too NEXT DOOR.. what's up with that?! Lol)",

Damn, I should have taken a picture to show you guys! The toppings inside the banh mi was sooo skimpy!! It was so sad! And the meat ball in my pate chaud was tiny!  This Lee's is skimping on their customers! Of course the 2 stars does not apply to allll Lee's, just this one in particular. I hope the owners/managers read all the reviews and make some changes! Customers would only want to support if the food has quality..and quantity. heheh :)",

Also, the food is prepared relativlely quickly and its a good change from the other 24 hour burger chains like McDonalds. My favorite sandwich to order is the #11 special combo: it has a nice balance of meat and vegtables.  My only complaint is the cleanliness. Since the place is open 24/7 it attracts the drunk crowd. I remember going here around midnight and seeing a pile of puke outside the entrance.",

I have been ordering this sandwich off and on for over a year.Was told it is no longer on the menu. I asked if they had house veggies, they said \"yes\", asked if they had bread, they answered \"yes\". They would not make the sandwich. Price was never discussed, they just refused to accommodate me. I was not asking for anything that requires more work or ingredients that were not avaliable. in fact almost all the sandwiches come with the house veggies and mayo.  This was some of the worst customer service I have seen in a while. why have a sandwich shop and refuse to make a sandwich.",

I decided to check it out when I moved back to Vegas today from Hawaii and I must admit the food was just as I remembered from all of the times I went to Lee's in California . The only difference was the staff . They were a little cranky and were not the best of help when it came to questions my friends had .  Besides that if you like Vietnamese sandwiches , try Lee's . The #4 grilled chicken is amazing !",

    "text": "This review is based on a grilled pork sandwich. I have to say their sandwiches are cheap, but you get what you paid for. First of all, it took about 15 mins for them to complete my one sandwich order. Let me put this into perspective: there were 10 workers in the back making sandwiches, and it took them that long. Sure, I came into an already existing long wait as there were people ahead who've already waited longer than I have. But still, the long waits are unacceptable.   The food: one word, tasteless. The carrot and turnip had no flavor. Its like they forgot to put sugar and vinegar when they soaked it. The meat was not too bad, it was one of the best parts of the sandwich. The bread was ofcourse, indeed one of the highlights of the experience. It was definitely fluffy since it was baked fresh.  Last of all, they have a wifi access point, but I don't think they advertised it for public use. If you have T-Mobile, there is no 3g while you are inside.  Conclusion: I would rather go to Mr. Sandwiches instead and pay just a bit more for better quality and taste, and to save myself 15 mins of my life.",

But if you insistent - please try them.  Especially if you like:  - Breakfast sandwiches that taste like rubber between two crusty and dry pieces of \"french bread\" - I put that in quotation because I know what french bread (baguettes) should taste and feel like, and this place should be damn ashamed of themselves for claiming they have good european bread.  Please.  - Bottom of the barrel coffee that's thick and tastes like tar and will set you back $4. Coffee that tastes like coal melted down with molasses - yummy!  - Banh Mis that are just shameful.  No flavor, wth?  Lee's should be paddled and punished for this.    - Service that is excrutiatingly horrible.  Example you ask?  I bought two breakfast sandwiches (#82, bacon ham egg and cheese) for my fiance and I. I open it up and notice there is no bacon and cheese.  I bring it over, and they want to argue with me that there was definitely cheese in it and that I didn't order it with bacon.  Are you freakin' kidding me?  I show the receipt.  I literally pick apart the sandwich to show there's no cheese.  No freakin' cheese or bacon dangit.  Then they tell me that I must have taken it out??  Really??  I walk out.  Screw this.  Never going back.  In fact, I may just stand out and picket this dang joint.  The taste of windy, sandy Vegas winds will taste much better than what they serve.",

And the slices of meat were just cut so sloppy  Pate chaud was seriously lacking of stuffing, it was pretty much all bread  The Thai tea with boba had HUGE icebergs and chunks of ice in it and the boba was not great either, my drink had more ice than actual beverage and it was hard to drink becausevof those huge chunk of ice.  Almond croissants are ok, I had better  The only plus is that its  open 24hours and they sell pate pre packaged at the refregirated section along with good tapioca desserts which is cool cause I love pate so i can make my own bahn mi at home instead of eating here again.",

    "text": "Not sure why this place has such a bad rating, it is just like any other Lee's and its in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown. If you can tell me a better place to get a Vietnamese sandwich, then perhaps I could see why you might not like this place but even then, the sandwiches here are awesome.   Whenever I go to a Vietnamese sandwich (Banh Mi) place, I always order the grilled pork sandwich (thit nuong). This is not to be confused with the BBQ pork sandwich which is made out of the red Chinese style pork meat. The grilled pork is pork marinated in a concoction of lemongrass and various herbs that give it a great rich but fresh taste. That along with the toasted baguette, pickled carrots, radish and serrano chilies make an awesome sandwich.   FRIENDLY TIP: If you're feeling a woozy hangover from the night before, which can happen pretty often in Vegas, grab a Lee's sandwich and take a bite. I've learned that nothing calms my upturned stomach more than toasted, fluffy bread. Oh and grab a Cafe Su Da (Vietnamese coffee) for the drive home - that coffee was made specifically for champs. :]",

    "text": "Wow, really?  Not at all what I was expecting, especially with all the hype that surrounded this particular location.  I live in the Bay Area, CA where there are plenty of Lee's Sandwiches. I've only been to one, in San Jose, but the variety of food they offered was mind-blowing.  So when my parents and I were visiting my sister in Vegas and she told us about this massive Lee's that just opened and had 500 employees (according to local news), and after seeing all their billboards, I was expecting something fantastic.  Well, not only did it not live up to the hype, it didn't even live up to what I would expect a Vietnamese sandwich shop to be.  Yes, the place is ginormous, but that's primarily the sitting area.  Set up bright and plentiful like a McD's, I can see people coming here during the wee Vegas hours.   The actual menu though is puny.  Some basic Vietnamese sandwiches (I've seen tiny locally owned shops offer a better variety) but mostly American sandwiches.  Huh?  Aside from the sandwiches, there are various sides, desserts, and snacks offered.  It seemed to me the place didn't really need to be as big as it was considering their tiny menu.  Sandwiches are pricier than Dakao, just a few blocks away and way way subpar.  I grew up on Vietnamese sandwiches and eat them regularly and these were probably the worst I've ever had. Edible, yes. But a far far cry from an authentic Vietnamese sandwich.   And the wait was pretty long too.  I tried their siu mai (pork meatball) and their grilled pork.  Their grilled pork tasted very little like Vietnamese grilled pork but was ok.  Not great, just ok.  Their siu mai though was very lacking in flavor.  I've never not finished a Vietnamese sandwich before but I couldn't find it in me to finish the siu mai.  Also, the sandwich itself was smaller than I expected.  Apparently, Vegas Vietnamese sandwiches ARE smaller than the ones in the Bay Area but even compared to Dakao, the Lee's sandwiches were small.  We had originally planned to eat lunch there and then order more sandwiches to go to eat later that day.  But after our lunch there, we instead drove to Dakao and bought some sandwiches there, which are much better, not to mention cheaper, not to mention they are a locally-owned small business run by a cute husband & wife team.   At least the girl who took our order spoke Vietnamese.  But she wasn't very friendly (which actually is pretty authentic I guess).  The Latino guy who was making the pastries was a lot more friendly.  Although they serve some Vietnamese food, I don't know that I would actually classify this Lee's Sandwich as a Vietnamese food place.  I honestly can't see this place surviving, but then again, I don't live in Vegas.  The reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is that my sister said their pate is the bomb. She said it is their only redeeming quality.  Unfortunately, since we ended up not ordering more sandwiches, I wasn't able to try it myself so have to take her word for it.",

Just ordered their ice coffee boba, ice coffee mocha, and hot mocha--they had a special of \"buy 2, get 1 free.\"   I had the ice coffee boba--the coffee was already mixed with condensed milk. I tasted decent but nothing I'm crazy about, and the boba could have been better if it wasn't buried in all the small pieces of ice (which took up 75% of the cup).  The BF had the ice coffee mocha... he thought it was just okay. To me, it was more tastier than mine.   And finally, the hot mocha (which I had a little later lol--I'm a coffee addict, what can I say? haha), now, THAT was friggin delish!!! Next time we're in Vegas and we have the extra time and if we're passing by the place, I'll stop by and order that with boba.",

As usual, I order my house special sandwich with a side of fish sauce and happy eat away.  The next day I thought I would go to one of my favorite Viet sandwich places and I was reminded of what a GOOD banh-mi is supposed to taste like. Delectable meats, crisp vegetables, mild but spicy jalapeno, and most importantly--soft, gourmet bread with a bite. I soon realized that Lee's is simply OK. The bread is hard, the service sucks, and the sandwich just isn't as flavorful as some of the other places in town.  The next day I tried another banh-mi place in Chinatown and was again reminded of how much better it was than Lee's.   Two thumbs up for CONVENIENCE (24/7) But thumbs down to actually good food. -____-\"  Go to your other banh-mi joints if you can. But if you need a banh-mi fix at 2AM. Mister Lee is there for you.",

The food is always super fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. I usually get the veggie bahn mi combo which comes with a drink & small bag of chips for $5.99. It's a decent deal and the sandwiches are pretty big so I usually can only eat half and take the other half to work or home.   The Asian cashiers are so friendly and helpful and offer outstanding customer service but be warned... If you happen to get a Hispanic cashier and you don't speak Spanish there will be language barrier problems. The past 3 times I've had a Hispanic cashier, they were extremely rude to me! One started speaking Spanish to me and when I explained to him that I didn't speak Spanish, he rolled his eyes, muttered something under his breath and went to ask another Hispanic cashier for help. She was a little more friendly, and from what I could tell was trying very hard to understand me but due to her limited English and very thick accent, I was having a hard time understanding her as well. Eventually I got my order, and of course as expected due to the language barrier, it was incorrect. I had to wait almost 30 minutes for them to fix it.   The second time, a different male at the counter spoke limited and very broken English. He tried to tell me my sandwich was not available with avocado and I explained to him that even though my sandwich doesn't normally come with avocado, I would like to add it. He then argued with me until the very sweet Asian cashier came around the corner and intervened.   The 3rd time was probably the worst. The guy at the counter spoke almost no English, was SO RUDE and when I ordered my sandwiches and Buy 2 Get 1 Free Boba he kept messing up the order. He finally got the order right on the screen, but when it came out the cooks had messed it up. As I asked them to fix it, he argued with me and asked if it was okay if I just had the sandwich the way it was. Umm, NO, that's not what I ordered. As I was waiting, my Boba orders came up and sat in the window. Since my sandwiches were taking so long, the boba started to melt and when I finally got my order my smoothies were watered down, melted , warm and nasty. I asked them to remake them and the guy freaked out and said I was being picky. I asked to speak to a Manager and when the Girl came out from behind the back of the kitchen and I explained to her my story she looked horrified. She fixed my order right away and even gave me an extra boba for free. Win! :).   Overall, my experience with this location is good. I frequent the Eastern location more simply because it's in the same shopping centre as my work and is an easy 5 minute walk. However, This Chinatown location is decent too. It's open 24 hours and has plenty of places to sit, charge your phone / laptop, study or just relax with friends. It can be pretty packed during the day especially around 11am-1pm and 4pm-6pm. I don't mind the wait, but the Chinatown traffic outside is horrible so be warned!",

The food is not mind blowing, but it is pretty decent for the money, and the portions are fair.  Everything I have had tastes fresh, and haven't really had any issues here.  Overall, it is a solid place to eat late at night, but you won't really see me here before midnight, since there are much more places I would rather eat.

But I digress, back to the food. This is the first real experience ive had with sammichs from.. where they come from.. The bread is ok very crusty and it really does get all over you but lends itself to hold the banh mi (Grilled chicken) I dont try anything else bc I can probably make a better sandwich at home myself. The pickled daikon are sweet and gives alot of contrast to the meat and the other ingredients.   Theres also some heat on this sandwich via fresly sliced raw jalepenos on the sandwich.. FYI be careful because the first time I had this sandwich not realizing what was on it  I got a mouth full of jalepenos and I thought I would never be able to feel my lips again. (if you enjoy pain, have at it).  In all fairness when I do come back its only with the hubby because hes working I know what to expect, nothing more nothing less.   They do have awesome smoothies, italian soda's freshly made (mango is my fav).  which kind of confuses to me but I guess since its considered to be a sandwich shop I guess it makes sense.

It was a decent sandwich, nothing to rave about, but everything tasted good.  Secondly I was weary of ordering a drink due to the excessive ice comments. I just opted for a soda in case I got the same treatment of ice with an expensive coffee beverage. Well... there was a lot of ice, but at least I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it.  That was it.

Pros: Opens 24hrs, cha and banh mi taste better than the locations in San Jose, Nice place to relax and chill with friends:  Cons: Hard to find parking, price is alittle more than the ones in other locations in the bay  Still a great place to eat good cheap foods compare to other places in Vegas..I would say better than Mcdonalds...",

It usually doesn't get crowded so it's a great spot for little group meetings or homework crammings. Food-wise, if you're looking for quality, you don't want to be coming here. My mom ordered a sandwich. She had quite a hard time downing it because the baguettes were kinda hard and the veggies were dry and falling all over the place. Bobas could've been better except for all the ice that took up more than half of the cup. I used to go there simply for their green tea waffle (and samples) Recently, those things have been taken down for some reason...and then you find other places that serve better food.   This wouldn't be the first place I'd run to for food but my opinion may be subjective, so you be the judge and go give it a try.",

I won't try to get into a battle of words with my fellow Yelpers, because I trust their opinions on many places, but on this one...I respectfully disagree.  Let me set the scene. It's 4:30am. I'm on my way home from the club. I had NOT been drinking, so I was able to judge my food with an able tongue.  Lee's is like your typical Fro-Yo Shop on crack, because it's 10x as big and is actually a Sandwich joint (with Fro-Yo...Yo).   I ordered the #11 combo, and my sandwich was out within 4 minutes. The baguette was PERFECT! The lunch meat they used was tasty, and I just LOVED the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to the sandwich to give it that extra Asian flair :)  I can't wait to come back. I most certainly was not disappointed. I did not have the horrible experience that some of my friends did.   I say give it a shot and judge for yourself.",

My favorites are the BBQ pork and grilled chicken, but I haven't had anything here that was disappointing. I believe if you buy 5 sandwiches, you get one sandwich free. The only thing that was weird was that after 9pm, they charge you a late night fee of 50 cents per item, which can get expensive. They are cash only, so with all of the money they are saving by not paying service fees, I'm not sure why they have a late night fee? Bizarre.",

    "text": "Why so much hate??? They've got to be doing something right for this chain to make it this far. Lee's Sandwiches will one day be an international phenomenon. Now I'm not on the bandwagon yet because of several key concepts, but I consider Lee's Sandwiches the Starbucks/McDonald of Vietnamese fast food. Not to say I'm against or for fast food chains, I simply respect success. Keep in mind how many people these chains employ and the salary and benefits they provide vs horribly ran, no customer service mom and pop places.   Vietnamese food really have the potential to be as mainstream as say American, French, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisine. But sadly, what really holds it back is the concept. Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand that style is as equally important as flavor profile. The rare greats that do understand, like the An family with the Crustacean (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anfamily.com%2FRestaurants%2Fcrustacean_beverlyhills%2Fdisplaypages%2Fhomepage.html&s=befd7abff1c61914acbb3798f145eabe3bb5e2872c198845a70bcec7ab9aaa2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anfamily.com/Restaurants...</a>) chain is simply killing it.   So ask yourself this. Would any non-Yelpers (Westerners), or even Yelpers that's not adventurous , dare step foot in a place like Dakao, or Pho Hue Thai and order Banh Mi?  I think Lee's Sandwiches is fantastic for what this city needs. It's a slap in the face for all the local shops to kick it up a notch (mainly Decor and customer service). It's a wake up call to say that good food is no excuse for poor overall dining experience.   In conclusion, this Lee's offers way too many choices for their own good. Less is more. Just look at Chipotle.",

So much for their \"Baguette Factory\"...the bread was hard and seriously tore up the roof of my mouth by the time I was done eating it.  The filling...eh.  I asked for double meat and double vegetables.  I'd hate to see what regular is; I think they maybe forgot to double the filling?  And the iced coffee, while delicous, was mostly ice.  I could barely poke my straw through the lid and then I had to jab-jab-jab it in to make it through the core of ice.  I was so fed up with it all I didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  Maybe I missed the best part of it by skipping that?  Oh well.  Thanks anyway Lee. I'll feed my banh mi cravings over at Pho Mailan.  * One star for being inexpensive (unless you count being charged for extra but don't get it)  * One star for cleanliness (as long as you don't look at all the handprints on the windows--come on guys, spring for some Windex and use it!!)",

Having said that, I was really excited to try this place out, after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was a but skeptical so I gave this place a try. I stopped by this morning at 9:30am, place was very clean so I give that an A. I ordered the following and my opinion.... OH YEA all these orders weren't for me, I bought a variety of stuff for me and my friends and all took bites ;)  #6- bbq pork... horrible, it was thin slivers of the red chinese bbq COLD  #11- special combo... the meats had so many artifical red coloring #82- ham, bacon, egg, cheese... nothing special, tasted like the fast food breakfast sandwiches #14- pork roll w/pate.... wheres the pate?? oh wait its smeared onto only half the roll!!!!  Deli Majo- look like little tiny madelines filled with sweet custard Hollow donut- covered with sesame seeds and fried Sesame Ball- tiny sesame balls filled with red bean paste, fried  Overall, I thought the baguettes would be light & crispy, but it was rock hard and too cold. There also was not enough of the dikon/carrot stuff... and too much cilantro!!! The pastries were ok....  This place looked like a really cool place, but you can tell its definitely a huge company that runs this establishment.... Next time you want a real Bahn Mi, try the small mom and pop stores... although you may have trouble with communication, you wont be disappointed with the food!!!",

    "text": "My dad brought home two banh mi and a loaf of bread from their grand opening. We were disappointed when we opened up the sandwiches to see the minuscule amount of filling.pickled veggies, or herbs. The cost of the last two items is virtually nothing, so that was baffling. I understand that the crunch of the crust and the bite of the bread is important, but does it make it right to skimp on the rest of the ingredients? Growing up in a Vietnamese family near Little Saigon, in California, I expected more from this place.  I normally like the special, which has a little of everything. Banh mi is a delicate balance between the aforementioned bread, a smooth pate, a creamy mayo, a fatty char sui, a Vietnamese sausage or fish cake, cilantro, peppers, pickled diakon and carrots. Too much, or in this case, too little throws off the sub. If you are in the mood for great banh mi, go down the street pass Cathay House. Their is a wonderful shop located next to Ann's Salon called Dakao Sandwiches. They are friendly, bake their own bread, and produce a far superior sandwich.",

    "text": "I don't really know what brought me to this place. I was on a nighttime drive through Chinatown, to which I was suddenly attracted to this surge of bright fluorescent lights. My initial drive home instantly turned into a detour. I fell victim to this place, much like a fly getting zapped by a mesmorizing bug light.  Walking in, I was kinda impressed. It seemed like this place had it all. It was like a mashup of everything I go out of my way for: convenience store drinks & snacks, Asian sandwiches, baked goods, frozen yogurt (coming soon), coffee, smoothies, boba, etc. It had all of this, plus it was open 24/7.  I was happy... giddy even. The concept of this store brought out the inner schoolgirl in me.   That all went downhill after I placed my order. I ordered a sandwich; a grilled pork one.   Price wasn't too bad. Maybe around the $4 spot.. decided to order a coffee with it as well. I sat at my table eagerly waiting (still on a schoolgirl mindset). Place wasn't really all that busy. Somehow, I still ended up waiting for my sandwich and coffee for over 10 minutes. A bit too long for a simple order. They call out order numbers using a DMV-like system. I'm guessing they're also trying to mimic the DMV wait times as well. Kinda boggles my mind to see how long it took, when I see what seems like 50 employees working the kitchen.  After I got my order, I no longer was ecstatic. My inner giddiness turned into a neutral feeling. The baguette bread of my sandwich was hard, almost stale tasting; the pork: nothing impressive.  After the first bite, I had the most plain pokerface going on. It was a bland, dry, and overall, a depressing food.   The coffee had a very strong flavor, though creamed and sweetened to the max. The coffee taste was so intense that I felt like I was getting smacked in the face with a sack of coffee beans with each sip. I kinda liked it, in a kinky sort of way.   Am I coming back to this place? Probably not. I know there's some new store kinks going on, but I just don't see how it can get much better than my initial visit.  Note - So far, it's a cash only joint, though they decided to get an ATM inside instead of a credit card machine. I guess they prefer to give us surcharges over convenience.",

I usually don't write bad reviews since I understand that running a business is hard and nobody wants to upset a customer, sometimes thing just happens beyond control or out of misunderstanding or miscommunication. But what happened today was not beyond control, was not because miscommunication or misunderstanding, it was just unacceptable! I brought my two young kids (1&3) to Lee's Sandwich today wanting them try out Manjoo for the first time. I have always been to Lee's for Their sandwiches and bought Manjoo several times for my office staff. When I was making the purchase, I specifically asked the cashier, a young man with glasses, that if these Manjoo I am purchasing is freshly made today (no date on box, just two numbers which I don't understand what it means). Without looking, he quickly answered yes. After paying, I opened the boxes so my babies can enjoy them and me and my husband each had one. As my kids eating their second Manjoo and I was getting one for myself, surprisingly I found the bottom layer of the Manjoo are molded! The first layer was already eaten by my family without looking with the trust that the cashier told me it was freshly made today. I was furious! These are eaten by my young children! 1 year and 3 year old ate the molded Manjoo! I brought these molded Manjoo to that cashier and questioning him why is this molded since he said it was freshly made today?! He then flip over the box and looked at the bottom and said, \"sorry, these are from two days ago.\" Two days ago?! So now you tell me it's from two days ago?! How can you sell these old Majoo after I specifically asked you twice if these are freshly made today?! If these are for me, I wouldn't be so angry. But my babies ate molded food after I put my trust in this cashier's words and Lee's quality of food! I am beyond angry! I am beyond furious! I will never bring my kids here or feed them anything from Lee's anymore!",

I was leery about trying it out because I checked Yelp beforehand... but I figured I waited this long for the place to open up that I had to try it out.  The clean, modern, open layout of the restaurant first attracted me. On the right side, they have self-serve frozen yogurt which I have yet to try. In the middle is where you line up to place your order and to the left is where you pick up. There are several tables and booths available.  I ordered the special combination banh mi and a thai iced tea with boba. Based on previous reviews, I made sure to request easy ice. Their system is like a well oiled machine. The wait time was less than 5 minutes. There is no chance you would miss your number from being called because there are TV screens that feature the order number and and a robotic voice that calls out the number as well.  The banh mi I ordered was worth the price. For under $4, the foot long baguette was fresh, crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the inside. The filling was delicious and was the right amount despite what other reviews say. I was completely full and satisfied with my meal.  My one major complaint is that they accept cash only. Thank goodness I had cash because I didn't see a sign and I didn't want to pay the ATM fee. As I was leaving, I looked around everywhere for a \"cash only\" sign and only saw a 2\" x 2\" sign on the door. There is no excuse for an establishment this big to not take debit or credit.  My experience at Lee's Sandwiches was very pleasant and I plan to become a frequent patron if I have the cash on hand. Another plus... it's open 24 hours.",

    "text": "As much hype as this place was getting from people I know, I really really wanted to like the place.  We ordered sesame balls with red been, one milk tea boba, and one passion fruit milk tea with passion fruit flavored jellies and boba. Unfortunately they were out of the sesame balls, but they said that they would make them fresh, and that they were worth waiting for.  Needless to say i was way excited, and looking forward to my freshly made treat.   5-7 min later we finally got the our drinks, however it did not at all look like what we ordered! we received 2 what tasted and looked like iced vanilla lattes from starbucks with only boba in one and both boba and flavorless jellies in the other. Surprised by our confused looks, the lady at the counter offered to remake the drinks. It didn't look like she had figured out what we wanted, so I declined to get mine remade, unlike my friend who accepted the offer. Unfortunately, the second time around was just as unsuccessful. It still looked about the same, except now served in a large cup instead of a regular cup, and about 1000 times sweeter.  Even though we were disappointed about our beverages, that was not the main reason for our visit, so we were willing to overlook it. However when we finally got the sesame balls, they were not only super greasy, they were super hot, and NOT red bean. Really?! What did I just wait around for?!   I do understand that this place is called Lee's \"sandwiches\" for a reason, and I heard that their sandwiches are supposed to be pretty good, but after 3 strikes I don't think I wanna go back to find out.  This place was disappointing, and I say save yourself the trouble.",

    "text": "**Cash only or a $10 credit card minimum** How does this Lee's get it right, but the Cali locations can't? We had plans to come here to just pick up a few fresh french baguettes for our lunch during the week, but it seems like Lee's had other plans for us. We ended up ordering a whole slew of things.  5 baguettes - somehow their bread at this location wasn't rock hard and didn't cut the roof top of our mouth. Even after a couple days and after toasting, the bread was still tasty and tasted fresh. Great for making toast points for bruschetta, wine and cheese night, or making homemade banh mi sandwiches. 5/5  1 banh mi dac biet (special combination sandwich)- we asked for extra veggies and meat for an additional price. They did not disappoint, they packed the meat and the pickles on high. The sandwich was stuffed to the brim. 5/5  1 nuoc mia (cold pressed sugar cane drink)- this is the most refreshing drink on a hot day if it's done with fresh sweet sugar cane. Maybe the sugar cane they used the day I came was on its way out and way too ripe, it had an off taste to it, like it was almost ready to rott. We didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish it. 1/5  2 cha gio (Vietnamese egg rolls)- this is my favorite here, they are small and always crispy and hot. They are addicting! 5/5  3 banh tieu (hollow donut)- this is also one of my favorites growing up. I love the slight sweetness to them. Either eat it fresh, or take it home and toast it till its slightly crispy. It's good when it's a little crunchy. 5/5  2 pate chaud (pork pie)- the pork pies were all dough and barely a dot of meatball inside. It also tasted like they should have baked it for a little while longer since the dough inside tasted raw. 1/5  1 pate container- great for spreading onto thier toasted French baguettes, or when you make banh mi at home. 5/5  2 day old croissants for 99 cents- any of their day old bread is a good deal it's all 99 cents. 5/5  This place is not only huge inside, but also has ample comfortable booth style seating. The place is bright and has a wide open floor plan, but they could really use someone out in front tidying up the tables.",

They somehow got some kind of plastic wrap in my smoothie, and when i brought it back they were acting suspicious and basically accusing me of putting it in there to scam them out of a smoothie (wtf???) I was then told to write my name and number on a piece of paper and leave it with them so that a higher up could contact me when possible. 2 days later I received the phone call,All they were willing to do was replace the smoothie. On top of that, when I showed up for it, I had to argue with the manager just to get the same large size I had originally bought. It felt like a joke. My coworkers and I will not be going to Lee's anymore. I'll post a picture of my plastic mango smoothie",

    "text": "This is probably the biggest and the nicest Lee's I've ever went too. I'm originally from San Jose, CA and that is where the original Lee's Sandwiches was from. It was always packed and it was the place to go since I was a little girl. Knowing that there's one here in Vegas is very comforting! Although they don't have the authentic Vietnamese desserts and side dishes, it's still great to have their sandwiches and bao's. (If you ever go to San Jose/San Francisco area, you can message me for the original location) I usually prefer the grilled chicken or the vegetarian one. At this location, ask them for extra sauce inside the sandwich, I think it's a little dry if you don't. That's only if you like your sandwich a little juicier. The coffee is amazing but strong here so incase you're not use to the Vietnamese style coffee, you'll have the jitters for awhile lol. It has condensed milk in there! You'll definitely have a sugar high and a caffeine kickers haha! It's best to get it iced. You must try their coconut waffles! They make it fresh! Ohhhh! If you want egg rolls in chicken or veggie, they fry it fresh too!!! Okay, I just got hungry. Lol cheers my fellow yelpers! Happy Eating!",

My husband got the special combination, same as mine except much more meat and as he would say \"it hit the spot\"  The store is cute with a variety of drinks and snacks to buy and had a lot of seating. Aside from banh mi sandwiches they also offer American deli meat toppings, steam buns, spring rolls and boba smoothies. It is also open 24 hours! It's a great place for lunch or a quick snack.  We'll definitely have to try the one here in IL.",

The place is really casual, set for dine in, fast food style. There's even a little grocery stands, clean bathrooms, overall a very calm and inviting space. I ordered the avocado vegetarian sandwich with daikon or house pickles no mayo or mustard and I said no cheese bout 5 times. When I got my sandwich it had a generous amount of cheese and little to no vegetables, not even half an avocado. But since the cheese was all mushed with everything I had to take off the cheese and tomato myself. I was very disappointed with this. My date ate and enjoyed his sandwich. I also got the sugar cane drink which tasted odd at the beginning but when you let it sit it in the ice for a little and stir it up it tastes so much better. I don't think I'll be coming back to this specific Lee's any time soon.",

I got my new sandwich and realized how thin it was..less meat...less fillings.. It appears they gutted my old sandwich and put the innards into a new roll with pate. This was why the new sandwich was so thin.  Not cool!",

The boba at Lee's is always prepared perfectly - soft and chewy on the inside! Their coffee is has the perfect blend of a strong with a little bit of sweetness.  Lee's sells Deli Manjoos. These deliciously sweet treats are shaped like a fish and are filled with custard. I cannot just eat one, especially if they are freshly made! Speaking of freshly made, I also buy their sweet coconut waffle. The waffles are green in color but so so good! They make it for you fresh after you order. Yum!  Lee's started selling churro too. I heard they are really good but never tried them.  This Lee's location is large in size but I never see the place completely filled with customers. I have seen the line very long though! The parking lot and parking situation is horrendous but there are 15 minute parking stalls available, which is very convenient.",

I'll definitely need to come back to try other menu items but all we ordered was a mango smoothie with boba. I was surprised that across the street at tea of joy, hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream size LARGE was $4.50 and at Lee's a small mango smoothie was over $5. There were 3 people waiting in front of us so it took 20 minutes for the drink to come out. The smoothie itself was really delicious but the boba was ridiculously soft to where we couldn't chew it. Right when I bit down to eat the boba, it'd almost disappear into my teeth.  I like that this place is 24 hours so I'll have to come back and try something else on the menu, like the coffee everyone raves about. At 3am it was busy with many groups inside socializing. I also enjoyed looking at the mini Asian goods they have.",

It's basically liquid cocaine, but sorry guys no cocaine just strong coffee & sweetened condensed milk, I believe .   Food and coffee overall was great like always, but the bathrooms are disgusting..

    "text": "I have given Lee's many chances, and far too many disappointments have come my way. I think that I have particularly high standards for them because they are soo much better in California. Their sandwiches are usually sloppy with a lack of/ skimp amount of necessary ingredients such as pate and picked daikon and carrots. Their bobas are inconsistent and not always as soft and plump as they should be, but rather shribbled with a hard center and dripping with boba water residue in my slushes and teas. The slushes are watered down and flavorless. I have taken my out of town friends here to try, and was embarrassed in doing so. I should've known when I tried to order in Vietnamese, not one person understood me because there were no vietnamese workers there. This really doesn't matter to me, but I can certainly see why the sandwiches are not up to par with my cravings for authenticity. I'd rather go to hue thai for the best sandwiches.",

The sandwiches are not gourmet or anything, but the bread is nice and it's tasty overall.... the iced coffee was too much ice, but oh well.  don't come here expecting fat sandwiches.. it's just quick/cheap grub... which is sometimes my style.",

Or, maybe it's because I'm a sucker for a clean, new resto that's within easy driving distance from the 15 on Spring Mountain? Either way, I had a great veggie banh mi at Lee's with some folks last week! Ratio of filling (very tasty, btw) to other stuff (cilantro, carrots, etc.) was spot on, and the bread was perfectly warm and flaky. YUM. It doesn't hurt that the honey chamomile iced tea was awesomeness in a glass. Negative points for the cash only option and the long wait for food. Because someone in our group ordered a smoothie, it took 25 minutes to make 3 sandwiches and tea -- smoothie lovers be warned! Other downer: the crazy parking lot -- I always feel like I'm going to get into 10 accidents!! Bottom line: will def. be back -- you really can't beat $3 for a yummy 'wich.",

I went in early morning so it was not as busy as it would have been during the day, but I ordered a simple breakfast sandwich and it was actually the wrong order, when I told them this, they just said \"ohh would you like me to just change the sticker for you to the order you wanted?\" this got me really upset because the sandwich I ordered was actually twice the price of the one they gave me. After arguing back and forth, the employee went to the back and came back out with my same sandwich, except this time with a sticker of the sandwich that I actually did order. More arguing finally led to a refund of my money and I left. There were a lot of good reviews about this place, but after my experience I will be sure I never go back",

It is also unorganized when it comes to the card system. One of the workers (dont know her name but she was latina) swiped my card for my meal at $5.99. She brought back the receipt and the receipt said $16.48. Good thing I saw it before I signed my name! I told her that my meal simply only cost $5.99 instead of $16.48. While she went back into the card machine to see if an error occurred, my friends approached me from behind. I told them about the problem. I exclaimed \"I hope she isnt swiping my card a lot of times!\" The worker says this to me \"You need to stop talking shit with your friends, im not fucking swiping your card twice!\" In shock I reply, \"What horrible customer service, its you're job to treat me with respect, how dare you talk to me like that!\" she replied \"if you dont like it, you can leave!\" Not only was I embarrassed in front of everyone but I was humiliated. I have been going to Lees Sandwhiches for years now! I even told my friends! But being treated like shit ended it. I am forever done with this restaurant. I will tell everyone that I know that this customer service was not acceptable. I later on checked my bank account and I was charged twice! I had to call bank of america immediately and clear up everything!   PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!  HORRIBLE SERVICE. LOWSEY CUSTOMER SERVICE.  PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!  There is a cheaper and better viet sandwhich place down the next plaazas. WITH BETTER SERVICE.  Dont waste your time and HARD EARNED MONEY!",

Ordered up four sandwiches for me and the fam, and the cashier politely let me know that I get a free fifth one.  Don't mind if I do, yo.  They were done in no time and we took the bag of goodies home.  I sat with my Dad in silence, eating my grilled pork sandwich.  Downright delicious.  What really makes a sandwich is the bread...this French bread was perfection.  Again, perfection.  I will definitely visit Lee's again when I'm in Vegas visiting fam and I am patiently awaiting for a Lee's franchise to open up in San Diego.  I knocked one star off only because it's cash only and I bet the ATM machine charges a human pinky in ATM fees.",

People were confused whether there were 3 separate ordering lanes or just one single line...  We had the egg rolls.  It was already pre-made and was sitting in the warming case/cabinet for lack of better words.  It was pretty weird that they didn't have any sauce for the egg rolls and lunchtime had just started...  We also had the grilled pork banh mi.  The sign said the sandwiches were 10 inches long and I initially thought it would be a good size sandwich.  Unfortunately, these baguettes were pretty thin or narrow.  The meat portion was ok, but more towards the slim side like the baguette.  haha.  The grilled pork was ok and wasn't bad...  The pickled vegetables were pretty good.  The sandwich was not soft and was not too hard, however, my upper palate was a little raw afterwards.  They were giving out samples of some type of waffle that had a green batter color in the inside.  That was surprisingly good.  Overall, this place was ok.  It wasn't horrible, however, I wouldn't come back, unless someone pulls my arm and asks me to give it another shot.  I've had better banh mi at other Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas and the fast food vibe didn't appeal to me.",

The biggest Lee's I've seen! * Lots of free samples to try. * express line available for strictly pastries and coffee orders * They have a room available for banquets and private affairs.  Cons: * Rock Hard baguette bread ! * Minimal selection of asian sandwiches * congested with traffic. * I order deep fried pastries for dessert and they threw it in the same bag as my fried egg rolls.. who does that??  Tips: * Go down the street to Mr. Sandwich * I'm not a coffee fan, but its strong and good according to my gf * easy on the ice for the ice coffee would be a most wise request.    Okay, so I came during grand opening and ribbon cutting, which explains the crazy traffic (but I attempted to come again a few days later and it was still busy so I opted for good ol' Mr. Sandwich).  I've had Lee's before in California and remember taking a liking to it, but man their baguette's are just super hard!  The express lane was nice for those coffee drinkers and pastry lovers, but I was here for sandwiches.  The disappointing thing is that they tried to have a diverse palette of sandwiches by throwing in american sandwiches (ham and cheese) on croissant bread.  If I wanted an American sandwich, I'd go to Subway (or better yet Port-O-Subs).  The option of American sandwiches was interesting at first, but it isn't even tasty. Sure this added diversity, but it also limited their selection of Eurasian sandwiches.  I understand Lee's is a big name and the opening ceremony was a blast, but it just didn't win me over.  Will I be back?  Sure, but only because I got a free $5.00 gift card for coming during the grand opening.  Aside from that, I'm good with Hue Thai's or Mr. Sandwich for my Asian Sandwich cravings.",

There's really no effort in eating a sandwich. You open your mouth, bite down, chew and swallow.  I made the boytoy bring me here since I sort of had a craving for banh mi and because he said he's never been. This is probably the worst place to introduce somebody to banh mi. Lee's is like the McDonald's of banh mi. Many locations, not the best quality. The bread was not crunchy. It was chewy and made my jaw hurt after a while. If you're not a fan of liver (like I am), don't forget to order your banh mi without pate. The cafe sua da never fails me, although it always comes with a crazy stupid amount of ice.

Before this place was open my boyfriend would count the days till their grand opening, So I was definitely excited and expecting more but honestly I don't have much to say about this place.   Food: dull, bland not exciting  Price: Okay   Hours/location: convenient hours and the location is close to the strip so its a good late night DRUNK snack",

We each picked up a sandwich and two others also got spring rolls.  The sandwiches were ALRIGHT.... you have to keep in mind the quality is going to pretty much suck, since it's a chain restaurant. The spring rolls were pretty bad... never had any like it.. they used shredded up lettuce.. cha siu (bbq pork) and shrimp. They were pretty gross but hey... you'll eat anything when you are drunk.  The interior of the place is really big and very nice. There is so much seating that the place looks like a ghost town but A+ for the effort they put in building the place.",

    "text": "It's True that Lee's isn't going to serve you the best bahn mi that is known to man, but what they offer up is reasonably-priced, consistently good sandwiches on fresh baked bread. They are always open, so if you are like me - traveling to Las Vegas from the East Coast with a sleep schedule that's completely out-of-whack - Lee's is an option whenever I find myself craving a good Vietnamese sandwich or in need of something to eat which isn't a couple of eggs and toast or run-of-the-mill fast food.   I've also been enjoying their coconut \"smoothie\", which is much more like a milkshake than anything remotely healthy as one would expect a smoothie to be. The packaged goods they offer are interesting enough to experiment with; I tend to get one or two cookie or hard candy packages each visit to save for later.   Service is mediocre at best, but it's adequate. I think they do their best given the drunken crowd which shows up past 11PM which is either elated to be fed cheap or obnoxious and too wasted to even remember their visit the next day. Cash only is a disappointment and likely the complaints the staff hear about this policy sours their mood hourly.   Two-thumbs up and three stars for Lee's. I'm a regular when I'm visiting Vegas.",

Probably because the baguette was better - was a little chewy, not stale. Value for the price is pretty good.  Also, as with A/C thermo is set at a right temperature and not too cold. This is important if you stay with a laptop - yes, this place offers free wifi.  I'll use Lee's when I have to wait for Samurai Motors across the street to fix my car.",

Easily the worst banh mi in town.  The pate chaud are obnoxiously greasy.  Ask them to double or triple bag them on to go orders unless you are cool with grease leaking through the bag & onto your passenger car seat.  On second thought...don't even order them.  There is a girl that works the counter in the morning that needs to be fired.  One morning I ordered 2 chicken eggrolls & 3 shrimp.  After I order, she tells me if I order 5 eggrolls I get a discount.  I educated her in math & let her know that 2+3 = 5...ugh!  I also ordered a banh mi & she tried to correct the way I said banh mi.  I'm half Vietnamese & know how to say banh mi...double ugh.  I asked her for nuoc mam (fish sauce) & she looked at me with a blank stare...I had to tell her \"Fish Sauce.\"  So much for my plans on hiring her as a Vietnamese tutor...  Getting Sriracha sauce from her was harder than pulling teeth.  She looked down to where the to go plastic cups of it usually are & said they were out.  I had to ask her to get it from the kitchen, where I could see a bottle of it from behind the counter...triple ugh!  She has consistently sucked on other occasions as well.  Only come here at 4am if you are drunk, have plenty of time & don't care what you are eating.  Do not come here if you have time constraints such as heading to work...you will be late from doing the girl at the counters' job.  Hue Thai & Mr. Sandwich are better choices, granted they are not 24/7.",

Not so hot and I had to ask for them when they called me up to give me my order. So not okay.   And I didn't understand the wait for the sandwhiches.

Their bread is always so perfect, and both the Vietnamese and \"Euro\" sandwiches are good. Delicious chewy medium-quality meat, onions, cilantro... yum yum yum :) Lee's is so comforting and just brings back so many good memories.   Don't get me wrong, obviously this is not going to be the best banh mi you've ever eaten, and not the best boba or Vietnamese coffee you've ever drank, but it is still so good. Lee's is like your Quiznos. Not the best sandwich you've ever eaten, but every now and then you get a craving that only they can satisfy.   I was very excited to see a Lee's sandwich so close to the strip, and wow, I must say this location is HUGE, very CLEAN, open 24 hours, and has WIFI! How could you not like this place?   I'd come to this location to study or get my quick fix of Vietnamese sandwiches. You can't really go wrong w/ Lee's. Please give it a chance!",

Their bread is rock hard, the veggies taste like they've been out for days, and there's barely any meat. Don't bother coming here for the coffee either because its 1/4 coffee and 3/4 ice. Everything is also overpriced.  The place itself is a little awkward. The last time I checked they had a frozen yogurt place on the side but it was closed. I guess its great that its open 24/7 but other than that fact, I wouldn't come here for banh mi. Drive down up the street a little to Hue thai or Dakao for your banh mi needs.",

I like how they have a lot of varieties and we didn't wait too long. The staff was alright. We went there around 1am so they looked tired and irritated. We ordered their barbecue pork and special combination sandwich and also the deli manjoo. Their sandwiches were alright. So much hype about it when the bread would cut the roof of your mouth. I would like it much better if they made it less crispy and more soft and warm. That was my only issue about the sandwich, but what do you expect from a sandwich that only cost $3 so I guess the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\"... The 8 piece deli manjoo on the other hand cost more than the sandwich and it was the most DEPRESSING and POOR \"thing\" I ever had. I was so excited when I saw it because its one of my favorites and I always got those at my hometown Guam, but when I got it here there was barely any filling, it was sooo dull, and it tasted old! I couldn't even swallow it, thats how amazingly depressing that thing was. They lost a star for that. This was my first experience here so I think this place was just \"A-OK.\"",

I recommend Lees if you want a good casual meal without hurting your pocket.  They are opening another location on Eastern by Serene / Richmar, a busy shopping area in Henderson by the airport, I will go there for sure.

    "text": "It took them that long to open its door. I remember seeing just the  Lee's Sandwiches sign in ages every time my family wanted some Pho instead of the casinos' buffets. Finally, we had a chance to step in its big huge doors last weekend. They make sure you  get in the store or what, they don't have just one entrance, but two over sized double door entrances. Feng Shui?  It's a WOW. I am used to the small sandwiches shops, or even other Lee's I've been to, not as huge, nice, clean, quality constructions as this one. They don't have the typical tables and tables next to each other, whatever you say, the next table can hear you all. It's spaciest but private feeling. I guess 'cause of the expensive glass dividers? Very good for hang out. That's probably why they have the yogurt station. The yogurt station wasn't ready when I was there. So I can't tell about the yogurt. They will have their Grand Opening on March 25, 2011. Hopefully, they can get the supply from Pinkberry.   We ordered the typical Lee's, iced  milked coffee, combination sandwiches, they have on their bags, baked every 30 minutes.  Their bread really fresh and baked within 30 minutes.  They must make their biscotti from their over 30 minutes bread then.  How in the world they throw out all their over 30 minutes breads. My kids love their biscotti. I ordered their chicken wings, and chicken nuggets for my kids to bring back to the hotel for after swimming snacks. Also you must try their green coconut waffles. Very gooood.  I've been to other Lee's and bought the ready packed food. For those who want some French taste for a lazy morning, or  a late night, try the French  pate on the selves if you can afford a little bit more than the Lee's fast food prices Pate. My cousins from France used to sneak in her suitcase and through customs for me the pates, can't bring meat products to USA. Heat the pate a little bit on a skillet, with fresh baked bread, and a little bit of the Maggi soy sauce (they also sale the very good kind Maggi there). Out of this world.  Don't forget the tin boxed cookies also on the shelves, make a very good gift.  Very fine cookies. I don't like the Frentel Butter on the shelves though.  It's a wanna be Beure Bretel from Normandy, France, but nothing like Bretel.  Well, at least now we can bring quality food back to the hotel and munch. My kids love the snacks after swimming and  I don't have to pay the ridiculous hotel prices.",

We ordered 3 ice coffee, 2 sugarcane juice,  1 croissant and 3 bbq banh mi. The service was fast. We watched Paris by night while waiting and after one or two songs, our food was ready. The coffee was just the same as at other Lees stores. But my daughters said the sugarcane juice was definitely the best ever. The banh mi was crunchy and tasty. My little boy loved his croissant. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't accept credit card. I don't understand why they would limit their customers. a wierd, out dated business phylosiphy",

    "text": "When you think of Chinatown in Las Vegas, one doesn't usually equate it with extremely fresh baguettes. But that's what you will find at Lee's Sandwiches on Spring Mountain Rd. I have enjoyed my recent visits and here's why. Spoiler alert, because Hello Kitty. No, but seriously, there are a lot of fun characters that greet you on the way in.  It wasn't my first choice to try Lee's Sandwiches when so many other options are available a few doors away. But what I discovered, mostly good, was an always open, quick service restaurant with a modern Asian flare.  After ogling the freshly baked bread through their peek-a-boo oven window, ordering food was top of mind. I was hungry like a ravenous wolf roaming the frozen tundra.  Ordering was a little sketchy, but I was thankful my purchase was fulfilled perfectly. I bought two BBQ oversized pork buns, a #1 BBQ somewhat spicy pork sandwich meal on a small baguette and a Dr Pepper no ice. It also came with a few egg rolls.  Here's the thing with egg rolls. They could be nuclear hot when coming out of their warming box, but like shoestring fries, they go cold faster than an aluminum engine block, in the Midwest, during a Polar Vortex.  A small tip from me to you, eat the egg rolls first. Then the pork buns and finally the sandwich. This latest adventure to Lee's had me trying a smidgen of mayonnaise on the sandwich. It may be shocking to some that I added mayonnaise, but it made the sandwich creamy, spicy and overall better tasting. Otherwise the sandwich is drier than your mouth after waking around in the desert for 20 minutes.  I'd order this combo and sandwich every time I visit Lee's, it's that good. The BBQ pork buns are a few dollars each, but totally with it. The pork has a nice pink color with a hint of sweetness, exactly how I like it.  But what's not to like at Lee's? There is unfortunately a few things that I must mention. The first is a minimum purchase when using a credit card. If you order food past a certain time of day, each item will cost .25 cents more. If you are trying to feed a family, those quarters add up fast. Then there's the drink, ice and refill situation. Order a drink with no ice and the cup isn't filed to the top, just where the beverage would have been if it included ice. A refill fee of .50 cents is next.  Charging for refills is kinda baffling, like really? I can get a $1 large drink with free refills all day. But maybe they are trying to offset their free WiFi and TV? Probably not, but I can't imagine what their electric, gas and water bills are each month. All of that aside, I can't wait to go back to Lee's Sandwiches.",

The grilled chicken sandwich with extra veges I ordered was lacking the extra vege and I thought did not have enough grilled chicken. The fresh French roll was ok but I would have like mine to be a little more baked with a nice brownish hue, not beige.  I'm not crazy about the layout with the fro-yo on the right, deli section on the left and ordering in the middle. It doesn't seem to flow.   I also do not like that this place is so franchise now. I mean they even sell their own mayo-like spread.   Omg, did Tony say that there will be slot machines?! Doesn't seem very family friendly next to the fro-yo machines.",

There was a decent amount of meat in it as well. Solid- would order again.  BBQ Pork & Grilled Pork Sandwiches: I felt like there was very little meat on our sandwiches, piled high with the veggie fixings. We ate them, but meanwhile discussed how we should have gone to Hue Thai for that mouthwatering pork sandwich we got there last time.   The sodas here always have a strange taste. I'm not sure why that it, it almost tastes plastic-y.   All in all, we might pop by for the occasional pork bun (until I can find a better one elsewhere) but will be taking the rest of our sandwich money over to Hue Thai.",

    "text": "This place has the cheapest sandwiches. $4 and change gets you a sandwich. And not a tiny one. A decently sized one. You'd have a hard time beating that. Unless you only have a credit card on you. Then there's a $10 minimum. Bring cash.   The sandwiches are okay. The bread is delicious. It's great they give you so much of it. What goes inside the bread is less impressive. They usually go a bit skimpy on the meat and they put a ton of accouterments in there like cilantro and bean sprouts. It helps fill the sandwich but sometimes wish there was a bit more substance.  The real issue with Lee's is with their drinks. Their coffee drinks, or anything they put ice in, is a total rip off. I've been to this location before and I have had to specifically tell them to lay off the ice. The cup is filled to the brim with tiny ice, so you get a few sips of drink. Honestly, I think it's cheap. You pay four bucks for an iced coffee and you get a cup of ice. Also, when I told them to lay off on the ice, the guy who took my order looked like I was crazy. Maybe they don't know that it's garbage to fill a drink to the brim with ice. Maybe it's just how they were told to make those drinks. It's horrible though. Don't order a drink that has any ice in it, unless you actually just wanted coffee flavored ice.  That's one thing I really wish Lee's would change.   Bread is great, sandwiches are good in a bind, avoid drinks as they rip you off.",

    "text": "When there is a Lee's in your city, that is a good indication Viet community ain't too shabby size wise. For growing numbers of Viets relocating to Las Vegas from Cali, this is for now, the only Lee's operating in the city of sin.  And for what it's worth, the location of the world's largest banh mi franchise doesn't bite the sour bullet the same way so many of the others do. The sandwiches are solid, but not enough to be considered legendary on their own. Sure, it's factory produced with the bread baked in house, but like many chain'y executions, the food lacks the love and subtle touches other local banh mi joints would otherwise put out. The dac biet (special) version of their Viet sammy may be their most reliable sandwich, even if the bread is a tad often too crunchy for the already bloody roof of my mouth.  When all else fails, shoot for a Viet coffee or one of their cold beverages. Vegas is already hot as hell during the summer, so their iced coffee actually does hit the spot. While it's tempting (and always available), don't give too much thought to their random snacks (goi cuon, cha lua, etc.). You'll likely find better at the Viet supermarkets or local delis, but expect a price inflated version at Lee's.  Got the munchies at 3AM? You're in luck, this Lee's, much like the rest of their neighbors on Spring Mountain are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Drunkards are less likely to come here from the strip from a cab, so expect a crowd of locals or Asian food craving zombies to source the late night scene.",

    "text": "Delicious Banh Mi Sandwiches in Vegas!!  A Chinatown in Vegas, who knew? Back at home, I live about 1.5 miles from the mecca of Vietnamese food in the DC area (Eden Center), where there are tons of banh mi spots that everyone loves. My co-worker told me I had to try Lee's Sandwiches, and I was skeptical, but I knew he knew his food so I took a cab out to Chinatown.  Went inside, and it was definitely a different set up than what I am used to for a Vietnamese place. It offered Vietnamese and Euro sandwiches, but the star of the show here are obviously the Vietnamese offerings. So i got the special combo, with the eggrolls. The Banh Mi's were superb! Lots of flavor, the pate and pickled vegetables were on point, and the cuts of meat didn't taste cheap like some banh mi's can have. It actually tasted better quality than most, and was very filling! The baquette was crispy, crunchy, and very tasty. This was actually one of the best banh mi's I've had, and I've eaten plenty of different banh mis... From San Francisco, NYC, DC, and now, oddly Las Vegas.",

    "text": "The Skinny: ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and it was so salty! The bread was also not as good as other places (2) service: the cashier was super friendly and service was fast at 1:30 am, (4) value: if you are craving banh mi late at night,  I guess it is okay.  But otherwise there are way better joints in town that do a way better job for less (2)  I had just got off work and was looking to nosh. On the way home,  I made a pit stop at Lee's to grab a bite. Was interested in all the various sandwiches they had including non-Asian ones.   I ordered their bbq pork banh mi #6 off the menu. Purchase was cash only and cost $4.86.  Service was fast,  friendly and helpful. I was kind of wondering why she offered soy sauce and hot sauce with my order. More on that later.   I unwrapped the sammy and it looked pretty legit. That is until I bit in.   The bread is pretty hard. As in scrape-up-the-roof-of- your-mouth hard. The middle part of the bread is kind of too dense and chewy.   Filling wise,  the meat is kind of skimpy and bland for bbq pork. Which is probably why they added soy sauce and rendered a very salty sammy. First time I have ever seen soy sauce in a banh mi. Kind of bad upon bad.   They were kinda light on the undermarinated veggies too.  Odd thing was the presence of onions on the banh mi. Never seen a banh mi with onions in it and I've had my fair share. Not a fan of the onions and now that I know will ask them to leave that out too. That along with the soy sauce.   Overall,  if you're craving some late night/really early morning banh mi,  this joint is okay.  But with all the other better joints around?  I'd give this joint a pass (2 stars).",

    "text": "Terrible service.  Avoid this establishment at all cost especially if you have a food allergy.  Today I ordered over $30 of sandwiches, one of which was the sandwich with pork roll and a sunny side up egg.  I clearly instructed the cashier that I only wanted the pork roll,  egg,  soy sauce, and salt and pepper, and nothing else in my sandwich.  This was for my son who's allergic to dairy.  When the order was ready, the egg was missing from the sandwich.  I brought it back and it took them over 8 minutes just to fry an egg.  There was no apology whatsoever.  Also,  there was a white sauce in it.  I'm assuming it's mayo.  Not sure what the ingredients in the mayo are, so I told my son to stop eating and throw it away.  Luckily, there was no allergic reaction but there could have been.  Employees are unfriendly and obviously are not capable of following directions.",

I got both and shared half of both with my Mom.  The fresh baguette is always the best plus the pickled veggies and jalapenos nicely compliments to the flavor of the sandwhich!  I love love loveee their iced coffee, but decided to their fresh passion and get the coffee to go.  The passion fruit was fresh squeezed and sweet to perfection.  It was the perfect drink for such a hot day on the strip.  The only disappointment was there weren't many Vietnamese baked goods or desserts displayed for sale around the store, which there usually are at other locations.  Maybe we came too early at 10am, but it is always open, so unsure about that.  Lee's Sandwich never disappoints and I'm glad to know I can get mt banh mi fix every time I'm in Vegas!",

This location is 24/7 but in weekends, especially at night when you want to get your late night munchies on sometimes you'll have a hard time finding parking in the area. There's a back lot area where you could park as well but you'd have to walk all the way around the entire complex building to the front to enter the store. Sometimes Lee's have the buy 2 boba get 1 free or buy 3 boba and get 2 free deal. I never know when it happens because it's random and they do not announce it as much, you'd just find out upon entering their store.  ***Minimum on a card is $10.*** Late at night (from my experience) they may not have change for $50 bills and $100 bills, keep your cash low. They have Asian snacks and drinks stored around the store as well but it appears to be a bit more expensive than a regular Asian market that has it.",

The Asian meats choices were very different both in cut and texture. The yellow mayo was slightly sweet unlike best foods style but it was good.  I like the pickled veggies and cilantro and divided about the slivered jalapeno.    I liked the combo offer that comes with egg rolls instead of chips.

The coffee is amazing but they could offer a larger cup for the size L and LESS ice too, it seems like it's more ice than coffee. 1 star off for the bathroom though because it always seems like it's dirty and the floor has not been mopped.",

I came here 4 times during my short stay in Vegas and each time I felt the coffee was different.  First time was a little sweet but still drinkable, Second time was absolutely too sweet (felt like all I was drinking was condensed milk-- I even waited for the ice to melt to see if that would help but it didnt and I had to throw the coffee away ), Third time was too bitter ( I let them know it was too sweet last time so they added more coffee and less condensed milk but it still didnt work out), 4th and final time was delicioussssss. I would still come here for the coffee just because I absolutely love Lees coffee and its the only one in the area but just be prepared for super super sweet sugaryness in your mouth!  On the last day, I ordered the special combination ( #11) and the bbq pork (#6)  sandwich.  Special combination had no taste to it.....for the bbq pork banh mi I could only taste the vegetables.   Customer service was very friendly each time .   Overall, I would come back just to take a chance on their coffee.  But the california locations definitely taste better.",

They have a lot of square footage, including inside the restrooms. There was plenty of room to sit and eat. The food came out pretty quickly and it tasted good, both sandwiches and drinks. All of the members that I bought food for seemed to like the food as well and it was probably a lot of food since there were some leftovers that I had to eat as well.  There is no self serve water. Due to the dehydration of my party I had to keep fetching water from the cashier. (Also, the people I bought food for drank all of the drinks I bought, and my friend thought it was really good compared to the other teas we have bought in the past.)  There is a PokeStop within reach of the building's interior.  Parking is pretty limited, but we got a space in front of the store.",

It's just the ease of the location (again, near the aforementioned pho place, which is the most restorative of soups if we are all honest) and how quickly it is to grab these and hunker back in your hotel room to eat your sandwich in the dark. Not that I've ever done that... These banh mi are heavy on the pate, from what I've noticed, and the bed could be crisper, but you're just trying to get something in your stomach. My routine is to order one to go and eat it when I'm done whining my pain into my pillow so I can avoid exorbitant room service and/or walking downstairs before it's time to go out and do the whole process all over again.",

After dinner - we were driving through some strip malls hoping to find another eatery to try some Chinese/Japanese food. However, it was already 11 pm and most places/restaurants had closed.  EXCEPT...Lee's! It was the only place that was open in its strip mall / plaza, so we walked in and purchased some sandwiches to go. :) It was a good stop for us, since we were going to drive to Grand Canyon the next day, so buying some sandwiches for the road made sense.  We ordered: Combination - yummy, 2 types of meat slices Pork roll & pate - I'm a fan of pate, so I really liked this sandwich the best Grilled pork - reddish color pork slices Special combination - 3 types of meat, instead of 2 types in the regular combination Roast beef - \"american style\" roast beef sandwich; my husband ordered this one  Every sandwich comes with some fermented/preserved orange/white carrots + some cilantro and slices of jalapeno. YUM! :)  There was a promotion at the time too:  Buy 5, get 1 FREE! We took advantage of that - the cash register lady told us about it when we were ordering.  We had to wait about 10-15 min for them to make our sandwiches and then off we went.  This place is OPEN 24 HOURS!",

But one time I went there and asked for a large lemonade, little did I know that there was SALT in the lemonade like wtf and then I went to go complain about it and they gave the same drink twice, until 30 minutes into my meal they come out and say \"lol this time I got it right, there was salt instead of sugar in the mix\" at that point my tongue was already numb from the lemon and salt mix they gave me.  They're very pet friendly I brought my German Shepard Misty into the shop and this girl was like \"right on I love dogs\"",

The ingredients are old, cold, and definitely not fresh. Tasted sour and spoiled to be honest. One of the banh mi we ordered is the bbq pork. They cooked it with onions. Never in Vietnam bbq pork has there ever been bbq pork with onion stirfried. It was disgusting!!!   Never again! Please do not support this business. Obviously Lee's sandwich did not standardized all of their chain restaurants.",

    "text": "Came here on a lunch break since I've been hearing from fellow colleagues raving how good Lee's coffee is and the fact that there big in California.  My first impression, real nice and organized inside. Lots of seating and flat screens. I liked how they have a express line for only boba and coffee orders. They have a voice automated that calls out your ticket number when your order is ready. I was a bit thrown off because it wasn't going in order, so at first I thought they skipped me. Perhaps whoever's order is easier to make is called out first.   I ordered the chicken banh mi sandwich with and iced coffee plus $1.00 coconut waffle. I'm not so much a fan of there sandwiches - bread is hard. The coffee is good- strong. However, they put only a small amount of coffee and then a grip load of ice! The coconut waffle (green) sells for $1.00 in which you can find them in single packages at the front register. My colleague loves it apparently. I don't know what she loves about it though. It was so dry that I literally was about to choke on the piece of waffle bc I couldn't get it to go down!   I was not that impressed for my 1st experience, but they do have a lot of other choices to try out - so I'll give it another shot. I also noticed they are soon opening a self serve frozen yogurt section inside.",

    "text": "I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).  Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.  I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).  So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.  (UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for \"less ice and more coffee\" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.",

Line was super long, but I have to give them props to maintaining such a busy crowd in an orderly manner.    The sandwiches were consistent with other Lee's that I've been to.  They even had a window with all their fresh baked bread! Check out picture uploaded :)  Their coffee is awesome! Strong, flavorful.  It was what I needed to wake myself up from late nights and long hours of driving!  I only wish they had more to-go stuff that other Lee's have available (ie. sticky rice, spring rolls, vietnamese desserts, etc).  This place is more focused on sandwiches.  Think of a Mcdonald's version of Lee's!",

It also seems like the prices are a lot higher but maybe it is because they are 24 hours so they need to cover the costs in some ways especially with such a big space.   I have never really seen this place packed like the locations in California, but service is fast & easy... they take your order quick & try to get your food out as quick as possible.   I usually always get wings from here... although it takes about 10min. For them to cook it... totally worth the wait for the hot steaming wings hahaha  The sandwiches seems to lack the amount of meat & more so veggies than what I feel is the norm for them... compared to California I feel like i can count how many pieces of veggies are in my sandwich compared to the ones I usually get that has veggies over flowing & falling out while eating your sandwich. This may be the main reason as to why my star rating is 3 stars.  But i do LOVE all the random snacks that they have... along with their smoothies which I think is pretty good & their Vietnamese ice coffee with crushed ice is the BEST especially if you are a student & you just need that pick me up.  The interior is nice though... very clean... although the bathrooms do have some sort of stench but i try to not use them unless in dyer need.",

    "text": "Meh. I figured Spike Lee would make better sandwiches. There's nothing wrong with Lee's Banh Mi per se. It's just that there are so many other places in Vegas that make better Banh Mi for the same price. Why go to a chain when you can eat local? That's my philosophy anyway.  Granted, all we tried was the Banh Mi and their grand opening special 99c iced coffee. The iced coffee was more ice than coffee. I'm not sure why they bothered. Judging from what the guy said, they offer this grand opening \"special\" and then rip us off with basically a cup of ice. He made it sound like they are only making it like that today because it's a 99c special.  There are other items on the menu that might be worth trying. Fellow Yelper, Tony T, says that this location has way more stuff than other Lee's in California. If you've never been to a Lee's, it's probably worth checking out, if just to see what the fuss is all about. Otherwise, I see no reason to return.  p.s. I don't actually think this is a Spike Lee joint.",

There is no order at all. Everything is so confusing and got held back. I was here on Sunday morning, super busy hour and there were only 4 people on the assembly line. Half of the time the people didn't even know whose orders are whose. The cashiers were confused and had their heads in their butts, running around figuring out orders back and forth handing out and wrapping food. This place is a goddamn mess.   I only ordered 2 lees ice coffees and I saw my order on the counter for 15 minutes sitting there waiting till they finally noticed that the order was finished. Furthermore they only noticed after I pointed to them my coffees hanging on the counter. People were impatiently waiting and hovering for their food. Their system is so inefficient it's so frustrating for me standing looking at my order. The sandwiches I had here before were cold and chewy, poorly wrapped.   I never had good experience here I very much dislike it. I would never bring a big group here for \"fast\" food. No good food can bring me back to this kind of service.",

I love sandwiches and boba, so I waited with high anticipation for a fresh, delicious sandwich on par with the quality Lee's popularity suggests.  Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough croissant with pre-squished avocado, a minimal amount of meat and veggies, and WAYYYYYY too much mayonnaise! Don't bother with the boba either, it's really hard and not fresh.  The smoothies don't taste like real fresh fruit either, even though they say they are. Funny, I didn't know jackfruit could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The smoothie I got didn't even taste like frozen jackfruit... it tasted like a premade flavoring added to a mix.  I should also mention that the cashier was fairly rude while I was ordering, like I was an inconvenience to her in showing up and politely expecting her to do her job for a minute and a half.   I was so hungry when I came here that I would have accepted even Subway as passible food.  For me to feel this badly about what they offered is a pretty abysmal first experience.  Due to such a stark lack of redeemable qualities I won't be returning... not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other place is closed... I'd rather go to a fast food joint, eat a Cliff bar, or starve.",

The manager was very nice and told me that their regulation is to throw it away after a couple hours.  I came in and he made the sandwiches again for me.  The sandwiches hit the spot! So glad I came here to  grab some sandwiches for my vegas trip. I ended up buying some steamed pork as well to snack on later and it comes with a baguette! He was kind enough to offer a plastic bag so that the bread doesn't get stale throughout the night. I'm def coming back again for my next Vegas trip",

Sandwiches, che(viet desserts), smoothies, coffee, eggrolls, pok buns, and etc...  Fast casual spot. You won't be served here so don't expect that.   They're are located in a busy plaza of Chinatown so parking might be difficult during the the dinner rush.  They only accept cash, which is ridiculous. There is an ATM on the side of the restaurant, but to have to pull out money from an ATM and pay a fee for a 3 dollar sandwich upsets me and most probably.   Great place for a quick snack in Chinatown. Might not be the best place for Vietnamese sandwiches in Vegas, but they are so convenient that I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon. It's upsetting because I'm from San Jose and grew up on Lee's Sandwiches, and this just doesn't cut it.  Their cafe sua da is amazing. They put way too much ice in it so you might want to wait til it melts a bit...pretty thick otherwise.",

Decent bahn mi, bbq pork tasted good but I wish there was more of it, maybe twice as much for the price, quite a bit higher than I'm used to paying. Kids enjoyed churros and chips. Wife had the club and liked it but thought it was pretty basic, decent price though. The baguettes were awesome, crunchy and delicious. All in all not a bad spot. I did miss the pate on my sandwich though I guess thats not how they serve it there, oh well.",

We took it back to the hotel and I was impressed with the size and filling.  Not only was there a decent amount of meat for me, but quite a bit of pickled vegetables.  The crunch in the bread made polish off the entire sandwich(also just finishing working out helped).  The coffee was sweet and served as a dessert.  Looking forward to coming back.",

The coconut waffle was green....WEIRD. It didn't have much flavor at all. My iced coffee was HORRIBLE. I barely took 2 sips. The red velvet frozen yogurt tasted gross. It had a really weird flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste like the red velvet yogurt I get a golden spoon.  The cream puffs were ok. They definitely needed more cream. One thing that really stood out, and not in a good way, was the loud speak system that announces when your order is ready.  I've made a rule. DONT EAT AT ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STAR. I, again, broke my own rule. I try to be spontaneous though. I try to \"live in the old days\" were Yelp doesnt rule my life. And, that fails me everytime. There are so many good places to eat in Chinatown. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.",

The bread was perfectly fresh- still warm, delicate crust, light fluffy billowy center. They don't overload the fillings, They are however filled perfectly. The balance between their meats, pickled veggies, cilantro, fresh jalapeno, magic house mayo, and fresh french bread is the thing that inspires symphonies. In summatoin: PERFECTION",

    "text": "Another quick dissapointment among a overrated franchise that has lost it's steam over the course of a few years. When Lee's sandwiches first opened it's doors in California it was among the best places to go to for Banh Mi, Iced Coffee, and even their deserts. Unfortunately as they expanded their stores their quality slowly diminished. Let's hope that Las Vegas is the last place they go to.  I had the opportunity to go to their grand opening celebration with a couple of other fellow yelpers, but for the benefit of the doubt, I wanted to hold off on writing a review on them since it wouldn't have been fair. They were super busy that day, so I wanted to wait a bit and come back another time since I didn't get to check everything out.  Went there last night and it was a major dissapointment. The Banh Mi still sucked, bearly any meat or paste, if you're gonna give that little then charge less. It's Lees Sandwiches, not freaking Louis Vuitton or Chanel. So please don't charge more just because of the name. And if you're gonna charge more, at least make it taste super delicious so it's worth the price, but it's not. The bread I admit is good, but that's only because it is baked in house fresh everyday, so there is no excuse to mess up on that. Iced coffee, hella expensive for the amount they give you. I piss more after being dehydrated for 8 hours.  Overall the store is very clean and obviously new, very flashy and modern. They have free wifi, YAY! But I wouldn't use it anyway.  Customer service, oh lord......I asked one of the workers last night if they still only accepted cash, and she pretty much answered me like I was stupid retarded. She then right in front of me turned over to her co-worker and whispered something to him about me asking her such a stupid question, and that there is a sign right there that says \"cash only\", and he just shook his head. First of all you dumb b!tch, if you're gonna talk sh!t right in front of a customer, then you might as well say it out loud and not try to cover your mouth with a freaking receipt. Or if you were smart at least wait till I'm gone and then say something. Fortunately I was in a good mood last night so I didn't say anything to her. So if you're reading this, YES, I heard you, you little twat. So let's rewind the retarded and don't get all pissy about me not seeing your stupid little sign. Out of all the shit and signs they have by the register how the hell am I suppose to see that little \"Cash only\" sign. That's like being in a night club and trying to find a midget.  So.............this junk get's one star, make your food better, charge a reasonable price, be smarter about what you say in front of a customer, and for god sakes accept debit/credit cards. We're not in the stone ages, and let's not make the stereotype that asians are cheap/stingy any more True than it already is.  I don't even feel like Rickrolling this place, sigh.........if Rick Astley were here he would just face palm himself.",

I wound up chipping one of my k9's when I ate it later at the hotel we were staying at. But that's probably my own damn fault for scarfing it down all fast.",

    "text": "Was walking through the shopping center and decided to stop in for a bite.  The atmosphere is great, I had a feeling of being somewhere totally different like I was in a little sandwhich shop in japan at 2am looking for some good food. The menu was a little confusing at first but figured it out and then asked whats good? We were recommended the combination #11. so we went for it. two #11 sandwiches with a soda to the tune of just $10.10. not bad for being 10\" sandwiches! ! So we get the sandwhiches and start eating them only to realize a very different texture in one of the meats. I check it out to that it has head cheese!!! haha I never had head cheese and must say that im glad I didnt know that it was in there because I would have never tried it. The taste was a little strong for me but what got me was the texture and I had to take out the rest shortly after. Besides that the sandwhich was great, meats were tender, veggies tasted great and added alot of flavor to the sandwich and the baguette was to die for!! I would just eat the baguette lol! All in all a very good experince at lee's. Will definitely be back and will explore their menu!",

And there wasn't much filling. The ice coffee was great though. A little too much ice, but the coffee was really refreshing for a hot day in Vegas.",

    "text": "For those of you who don't already know, Lee's sandwich is a very popular franchise throughout the west coast that specializes in Vietnamese deli, refreshments and desserts. Look at it like a McDonalds, but a little bit more healthy and among the Asian community. Back in the early years of 2000, Lee's sandwich used to be one of my favorite pit stops every time my family and I would go to California. They USED to have one of the best BBQ pork baguettes in CA and their combination baguettes were to die for. Now, however, given the expansion of this franchise to Vegas, Lees sandwich has gone down in quality so much that the only thing worth going there for is just their coffee and 24 hr convenience.  Whenever I go there to order a sandwich, it always seems like something is missing from the core. Whether it be too little meat, too little veggies, or too little sauce, it never comes out full or consistent. The meat that they use for their special combination is also tasteless, and they never seem to put enough mayo/sauce. Same goes for their BBQ pork. It has no BBQ flavors, plus is too sweet and always dry. I'm Vietnamese and I know how a proper sandwich should be made. Most Vietnamese people will tell you, It needs to have some  dashes of soy sauce in order to wrap up the flavors. However, it seems as if Lee's tried so hard to make their food Americanized for a more diverse crowd, that they made everything bland and flavorless (almost with a \"healthy\" image). On top of that, the workers making it need to be more on the same page.  Not once have I gone there did I get a sandwich that was well stuffed and not mostly bread when I take a bite. Also, the next time you buy their sandwich, try leaving it out for about 30 min before eating it. Guarantee, the baguette will be hard as a rock. Same goes for reheating the sandwiches. The outside should be CRISPY, not hard! It should not be that way!  However, there is one thing good that I would like to give Lee's recognition for (which is also what earned it 1 more star)... Their Vietnamese ice coffee is to die for. The roast they use is very rich and deep in flavors. It is not as strong as Vietnamese coffee straight from the filters you get when you order it in pho restaurants, but the richness is definitely there. On top of that, their coffees have the perfect combination of cream at the same time.   Overall, if you're not hungry, then I would definitely suggest getting their coffee (for the same price as a baguette), instead of anything else. You can definitely give it a try, but know that Lee's sandwich failed at making Vietnamese Banh Mi.",
