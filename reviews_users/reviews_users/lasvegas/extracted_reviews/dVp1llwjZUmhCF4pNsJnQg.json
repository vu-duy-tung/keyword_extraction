    "text": "Breaks my heart to give them a low review but this place has one big problem:   They've clearly bitten off more than they can chew.   While it is nice to have an extensive menu, it doesn't help when the waiter essentially tells you before you fall in love with anything on the menu, ask me if we have it.  I have been here several times at different times of day (even right when they open) and this message is always the same.    The things I have successfully ordered have come out cold, bland, or poorly executed (I.e. things that should be crispy come out soggy, cold condiments put on something that should be hot, etc.).    While the woman running the kitchen has great ideas, I wonder if she has ever run a kitchen before.   They are missing key elements that a professional could help them clean up.   I have high hopes for this place and will return to see if they're able to get past these basic issues.",

I was a bit bummed that it was just hearts of palm and maybe a little jackfruit and felt it needed a bit more texture. But judging by how delicious other people's plates looked I think I just got a dish that wasnt for me...not something that was made badly. Looking forward to coming back to try more. Breakfasts look legit.",

    "text": "Here we go! We ventured in this past Saturday to give TMV a try. Some people might say the location is slightly questionable, don't let that stop you. The addition of a legit restaurant on this corner will hopefully add more positivity to the atmosphere. I myself am pleased they did not choose an ultra hipster or multi million dollar venue to debut there efforts. Good choice guys!  The decor is crisp, clean,hard lines that I would describe as ultra modern. Everything from table and chair seating, picnic table, couches, to bar seating. Well lit with clean white being the overall color way. Appealing art and decor through out which also continues right into the two unisex restrooms.   Upon arrival we were greeted and seated promptly. Servers were friendly and attentive,a little scattered at times, but hey they'll have their rhythm and flow down soon I'm sure!!  The menu is much larger than I had anticipated. I'd have to say probably the most expansive vegan restaurant menu in town and yes they offer signature cocktails and beers as well. Although tonight our server informed us of several items on the menu that would not be available, due to the chefs working out the kinks and getting in their groove I suppose.   Tonight we tried the breakfast burrito which is served supreme style with all the fixing you would expect in an all out supreme burrito. It is served with breakfast potatoes on the side. Good combo and very delicious. We also tried a burger called \"the BFF\". It is a Beyond Beef Patty decked out with Mac and cheese in the middle. Mmmmm, mmmmm, tasty as can be and accompanied with fries. I nearly forgot, we also had the trifecta avocado toast(see pictures)so delicious. I had a PBR my wife had a strawberry smoothie.   We really enjoyed our dining experience and look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times now and I am overall happy with the menu and service, but it feels like they are still working out some kinks of being a new restaurant. The hostess seems bored and the wait staff are a bit green (no pun intended) and therefore super attentive. Silverware and napkins aren't bundled, so I got my fork first, then my spoon with my coffee then a knife when my meal arrived. It's a first world problem, but if the wait staff and hostess were doing side work then they might hover less and look a lot less bored. There are also table top staples that are conspicuously absent, like salt and pepper or sugar packets. Again, I think it's because they're new, and it didn't inhibit my enjoying my meal terribly.  The preparation of menu items seems a little inconsistent. My first visit I noticed my waffles were missing some toppings, and on my second visit my husband's breakfast burrito was missing guacamole and rice and beans, but got a lot of lettuce and onion. Being that he's not even a vegetarian, I don't think I'll be able to get him to go back with me, he was pretty underwhelmed.  I however will be back, the breakfast items are pretty yummy and I want to try their smoothies and desserts. Also, the coffee is really good and they have an abundance of dairy free creamer options, which is something I can't find at a regular greasy spoon diner.",

    "text": "Ambiance: modern on a low budget with music at 7/10 in an echoey environment.  The good: Buffalo chicken is top notch. Fries appear fresh cut and are a nice square size in between steak fries and shoestring. No goofy seasoning. Best vegan cheese dishes I've ever had in the queso and Mac and cheese.  The bad: the Lobster roll - lobster being replaced with hearts of Palm is pretty clever. The hot, buttered, soft but crisp roll being replaced with a pale, cold, doughy thing is not. Probably the result of a too-many-items on the menu issue.  The meh: carrot cake has zero carrot flavor but overwhelming almond flavor. Great frosting and consistency and wonderful if you love almond. Weird if you expected carrot.  The price: understanding that quality fresh ingredients cost more, the food prices here still feel a buck or two on the high side. Likely will drop as more vegan competition opens up.  Why go here? Maybe you're a newly converted vegan who would give your left turnip for a spicy buffalo chicken sandwich, or maybe you're super lactose intolerant and could KILL for some queso dip. Or maybe you've been vegan4lyfe and want to convert some of your omnivore friends over to the green side. All good reasons to be a patron.",

But we were all ready to go. Instead of offering it to her for free for waiting - the kitchen staff was seen eating the food out in the open! No one came to apologize. My husband spoke with the manager because he hunted down an employee after waiting for a check for 15 minutes. The waitress just wasn't attentive to our table whatsoever. But on the way out she had a very terrible attitude and was saying goodbye in the most condescending tone of voice.   The owner offered 10% off of our next visit. There won't be a next time. I had high hopes - but after the lack of professionalism.. I won't spend another $50 there.   Food ideas were great. Fry appetizer was literally fries, lettuce and cheese sauce. Jerk burger was flavorless. Mac n cheese was too sweet and overpriced. I would go back if the service wasn't crap but they don't seem too concerned about that just yet.",

    "text": "Update:  I accidentally deleted the TMV response laughing at my food poisoning and telling me it could not have possibly happened there and to look at everything else I ate that day. I will let you know it is the only place we ate all day and we were the last table of the day.  I certainly hope you are reviewing handling and prep practices.  A posted picture of your Queso from earlier showed it topped with red and green peppers.  Ours came out with a big glob of shredded lettuce on it which is where I think the problem came from as this is the only thing we shared besides the cheesecake. Probably a substitution after you ran out of ingredients.    I would like to sincerely thank you for your concern and suggest that some customer service training may be in order as well when it comes to handling dissatisfied customers.    Let me start by saying we have really been looking forward to this place opening and really wanted it to be great.  Any new opening is going to have challenges.  I'll explain the 1 star rating upfront.   My wife and I ate there Saturday afternoon, two words, food poisoning.  She got sick first out of nowhere  about 6 hours after we ate and I quickly followed suit.   Been getting sick all night.  The one dish we shared was the Queso dip.  We got there at 1:30 PM, and did not get seated until after 3 PM.  Tables were full, several had \"Reserved\" signs on them with no people.  It was very noticeable that there was no food coming out of the kitchen.  As tables started emptying out, they would not seat anyone because the kitchen was so backed up. They also were turning people away at the door with the restaurant half empty.  We were able to order after 3 PM and placed our entire order at once so we would not have to wait any longer than necessary.  They were out of most of our first choices, I finally just asked the server what they did have instead of continuing to be told they were out.  We ordered the Queso appetizer,  the Ruben, the meatball sub and the Cheese Cake Sampler.    The Queso had a very strong Nutritional Yeast taste.  ur desert came out 10 minutes before we saw our sandwiches.  Definitely have timing issues that may get worked out over time.  My wife really liked the Ruben.  The meatballs on the Meatball Sub were well seasoned.  The sandwich was supposed to have melted \"Mozzarella\".  It came with what looked like Daiya shredded Mozzarella that was ice cold.   The cheese cake was fine.  Kind of a play on Peanut Butter and Jelly.     The Hostess spent most of her time apologizing.  Does not appear they were ready.  We were alreay talking about giving TMV another shot during he week, unfortunately, die to the food poisoning, we will not be going back.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place such a low review, but they really gave me no choice with all the issues they had today. It's been exactly one week since they've opened so I will definitely come back in a month or so when they're more in the swing of things  The restaurant wasn't full of people when I came in so I was looking forward to decent wait times.  I started off with the flamingo smoothie and it took about 10-15 min to get it. For a $7 smoothie I feel like I should've gotten a bigger portion and it wasn't very sweet.   I ordered the chicken and waffles and the wait time was about 30 min, which is fair. The presentation was great; however, the waffles were borderline cold and they were not crispy on the outside at all. It was more like chicken and pancakes than chicken and waffles. It was also served on top of mashed potatoes which made them a little soggy. I had to ask for a side of salt because the potatoes were so bland. Additionally, there was no syrup on top of my waffles, just butter. All of the syrup was on the bottom of the plate and got into half of the mashed potatoes, which made them sweet instead of savory (you can see in the picture).  I had to ask for two sides of syrup so I could actually get some on my waffles and came to find out they charged extra for it. The fried chicken was amazing! It was crispy, juicy and so far the best vegan chicken I've ever had. I got a refill of my smoothie and the second one was way better than the first one.   I also had the TMV cheese fries, which were okay. The fries by themselves were pretty good but the queso had no flavor to it at all. It seemed like it was there for nothing more than to look like cheese because it didn't taste like anything. I ended up dipping the fries in ketchup because I couldn't get on board with the bland cheese.   I ended up having a lot of left over food and when I asked my waitress for a to-go box she told me that they didn't have any. I was pretty done at that point, how does a restaurant not have to-go boxes? Needless to say I had to waste the generous amount of leftover food I had and was very disappointed with my experience. I will visit again eventually to give them a chance to redeem themselves. I hope their service gets better.",

    "text": "I am so ecstatic to have a comfort food , vegan type of place in town ; warm welcome. We sat down to look at the menu first , and decided to eat there based on all of the selections . I saw that other people reviewed the restaurant being out of several items, we did not run into this problem. We ordered the loaded fries, a chocolate shake , Buffalo chicken burger , and the burger that had macaroni and cheese on it ; fucking delightful . The only think I will mention is that the chocolate shake description stated it would have coconut whipped cream on top , which it did not . I didn't care though lol, I am easy to please and it was bomb as hell either way. The French fries were loaded with cheese sauce, which I love and the burgers were extremely flavorful and each had a distinct taste. I am very excited to try everything on the menu. Last thing , the portions are huge , and I had plenty of food to take home :) so excited for more vegan food !",

We ordered the Reuben and steak and eggs. Both were delicious and came out fast. I love having a vegan place so close to where I work. I'll be back soon for sure!",

There was a lot of I don't know.  The three of us ordered and two meals came out. They ran out of the 3rd option which was a common theme on a lot of items. Again our waitress was super sweet. We were going to come back on Sunday but we're going to let them work out the kinks. I'm giving a 5 star because this place will only get better with practice. Good luck!",

There is something on the expansive menu (easily more than 50 options) for everyone, even non-vegans in my group were happy. I'm honestly perplexed by the other reviews complaining about the service, as over my two visits it was stellar both times, attentive without being annoying.",

We told them we became vegan 2 years ago and they immediately told us \"the kids won't eat vegan...\" Strange, the kids are 5 and 9 they don't even know what vegan is.....  The kids were pouting because the parents already poisoned their views of \"vegan food\" and kinda presented \"vegan\" as a nasty word to them. The kids pouted the whole time they were in the restaurant. The parents ordered mac and cheese for their kids and they didn't touch it saying they don't like the flavor. I tried it and it tasted amazing. Anyways the server found out the kids didn't touch their food and took the items off the bill. It was a very nice gesture. My husband and I had Chicken and Waffles and cleaned out our plates. I really appreciate TMV's staff looking out for their customers.",

One of the female bartenders who's short, dark hair & usually has her hair in a bun, yeah doesn't have the best attitude. Kinda seems like she doesn't wanna help anyone. I ordered from her one time, she didn't offer me fries or a salad with my order & left so I had to stop her before putting my order in to make it with fries her response \"oh yeah\"  But like I said, the food is fucking amazing.

I mean normally vegan food is pricey but that's because it's all about the quality of the food and not so much the quantity. I have to say that the quantity and quality at the Modern Vegan was over the top! Everything was superb. Lots of flavor, very tasty. The chikn and waffles my wife got was Humungous that we actually ended up sharing it lol. I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was just amazing. Very tender and the sauce that went with it was amazing. We are coming back in April for our next Vegas adventure. Till next time. Thanks!",

I was wearing \"bride to be\" sashes/tiaras and the staff quickly picked up on it and were really congratulatory, which was sweet! They quickly sat us and brought us our drinks which were delicious (The Plant Killah and Too Pretty to Work.)  Our food was equally as delicious. I ordered the Mac and Cheese, while my MOH ordered a buffalo burger. It's hard to find good vegan Mac and cheese, but this was absolutely delicious. My MOH really enjoyed her burger as well, and ate it so fast I didn't get a chance to try it! Lol. I wish we had room for dessert, but unfortunately we did not. However, it is a food excuse to return another time - which I definitely will!",

We just spent a week in town and we enjoyed our first meal so much we had to come back even with so many great vegan options around the city (compared to central Wyoming). I tried the philly cheese steak, the lobster roll, and the Austin (a killer salad covered in their own house \"steak\"). We also had a side of the Mac and cheese which was phenomenal on its own. I caught notes of roasted garlic but none of the standard noochy notes that come from vegan Mac. If TMV published a cookbook I'd be in line for 2 tomorrow. The food carries this place but the decor is great and the staff is professional and attentive. I never needed anything. I'd recommend this place to anyone regardless of your dietary preference. We took a friend that wouldn't have known the chicken on his salad was plant based if we hadn't been up front going in.",

First bite he stated he wasn't able to tell the difference between an animal based pulled pork sandwich and the plant based one he was currently eating.   I had the Louisiana Fried Chicken. Overall the food was good. The chicken was crispy, the mashed potatoes were creamy, and the coleslaw was refreshing. Although, parts of my meal were incredibly salty. I'm not sure if it was the gravy or the breading on the chicken that was covered in salt. When I ate each bite of food with the mashed potatoes it definitely mellowed out the salt though.   Each staff member was very friendly. The wait time on food was pretty inconsistent though. We recieved the Pulled Pork Pretzel Bun relatively quickly but had to wait much longer for the Louisiana Fried Chicken. My partner had already eaten his whole Pretzel Bun by the time I recieved my food.   I would definitely go back again to try out other things on their menu. Overall we both enjoyed the food dispite some hiccups.",

    "text": "So...the hours are all over the place, apparently. Call before heading in, that is if you dare to head in at all. Limited hours on Mondays and Tuesdays with a completely different, limited menu. Weird, but we're starving so we stayed. Wish we hadn't. I wouldn't bet on them being around in a year or 2 unless they up their game in a major way. Anyway....  Place looked closed when we got there. Very few patrons, but that doesn't stop us from having to chase down the waitress constantly as she seems to love ignoring us. At least she was smiling and cheery in our limited interactions, I guess....  Burritos came out cold. Took awhile to get them out, too. Odd given such an empty place. For some reason they also serve wet burritos on a pan lined with paper...which gets wet and soggy...and, ya know, tears and gets absorbed by your food. I don't think I need more paper in my diet, but I guess they think otherwise.  Goes well with the deafening music they blast, I guess. Maybe they figure you'll complain less if you have to shout at the top of your lungs.  Anyway, we asked for our burritos to be heated up. When they came back they were lukewarm instead of cold, so we took them to go since I guess heating up food outside of your home is a challenge.  So why 2 stars instead of 1? Well the French toast we also ordered that came out while the burritos were being \"reheated\" was pretty good. Not amazing, but good. \"Anything with that much sugar is going to taste good\" remarked my dinner companion. Still, I maintain it was at least slightly more than that, and enough to hit 2 stars when combined with a cheery, if mostly absent, waitress.",

My order of the number one skillet somehow never got put in so we waited 15 minutes while the burger got cold, which we then sent back bc no one likes cold burgers. . My skillet finally came and it was the wrong one. We ate it anyway. The server apologized and the rest of the staff was friendly. The manager apologized as well but unfortunately did not comp the meal. This might not be our first choice next time we are in town for Vegan food, too bad because the food is actually pretty good.",

One thing to note none of the staff asked about if there are any allergies for them to be aware of which I think for a vegan restaurant that should always be asked to the guest!!!!!   Was greeted immediately and sat down with menus. Menu had like 100+ items (a lot TBH) which is great and all but it was sorta overwhelming. Waitress was kinda pushy on getting apps but also was thorough on what was hot on the menu.   Food was alright. Had the cauliflower and fries (should be an APP, not an entree) it was a little too breaded for me but it was still great. Fries were hot and not soggy which is a plus!   Had the pasta which was alright but the bread that came with it was waaaay better then the dish itself. Meatballs were tasty.   Would I come back here, yes if I studied the menu so I know what I'd get prior without feeling so overwhelmed with the menu.",

It's the type of place you can take your non vegan friends (if you have any) and they won't know they are eating plant Based. The menu covers every meal for every time of day. They are also open basically all times of day. There is beer, wine, and cocktails. The whole place is black and white mod so it has to stay clean or you'd see it. This isn't like the I only eat salad dressed with alkaline water type of place. This is the can I get a beer a margarita a bacon burger and loaded nachos type of place. Or mimosa v'eegs Benedict and breakfast burrito type of place. Whether your vegan, vegetarian, or a person who hasn't figured out eating animals will kill you. You will like something here.",

It's uncannily bright inside. Lights are turnt up and every table is reflective bright white.  My husband was excited about the milkshakes and tried to order one, but they no longer offer them despite them still being on the menu. Out-of-date menus are one of my pet peeves... just put some tape on the milkshakes.  We ordered a side dish I was very keen on, but never received, with no explanation. The restaurant wasn't busy when we were there (early evening) so I'm not sure what happened.  The food is obviously erring on the unhealthy side; duh. I knew what I was getting into but still was surprised at the oiliness of the breading on the buffalo sandwich. The pretzel bun was also slick on top with oil.  On the plus side, I'm really thankful for additional vegan options in Vegas, and the menu is very ambitious.",

He kept our drinks full and had suggestions for every food-related desire we could come up with.  I cannot say enough about his service and this company.

I been vegan for a few years and have tried a lot restaurants. First impressions walking in..it felt like I was in the iRobot movie with Will Smith. They got chains hanging from the ceiling! It was kind of funny lol I'm slightly biased because I'm vegan to eat and be thicc. I don't care about no healthy tasty green salad vegan food. The food overall was kind of bland tasting. I think everything just needed to seasoned better.  Also I'm so grateful vegan restaurants are thing but I don't like when restaurants use gardein meat lol. It's probably the cheapest option I'd imagine. The workers here seemed kind of annoyed and depressed. They were nice and didn't do anything wrong but us vegans usually are out here radiating our positive energy and I just didn't feel that in there. Shout out to the bartender with the curls though, she was really sweet to us and none of that applies to her. I hope the other workers take after her.",

Finally, the bartenders were fairly new so we're still getting acclimated so that part seemed a little rough but we laughed through it.",

As we walked in nobody greeted us however there is a host station. Waited for a waitress around 10 minutes to take our order. I asked for a cup of hot water, but their coffee machine was broken, so I asked to heat it up in a microwave. What as a result took them 30 minutes.   Served glass of water had a green lipstick trace. It was replaced in 30 minutes as well :/  Food...well, nothing special, we ordered a Pad Thai, it was too oily. And I had a carrot raw cake, which was frozen (although it is claimed that it should be raw and fresh). Didn't taste like a desert at all. For 10$ it is disappointing.   Wish I could give this place another shot. That have a great potential and definitely happy that we have more and more places for Vegans. Wish they could add more raw dishes like wraps or desserts, less \"meat\" substitutes (because for lots of Vegas it is unacceptable).  Wish luck those guys!!!",

Everything was amazing , the burger had some pizzazz kick  , and yummy , the banana was OMG .  The only thing I would of liked , was the waffles to be a little crunchie , not soft.  The server was very attentive  and the bus boy deserved a bog tip , he was always filling our water glass and promptly took away our dirty plates.   THIS place is SO awesome.

    "text": "First off, I had high hopes of the food because this place has good reviews and is a little on the pricey side.  Second off, I travel a lot and get to try a lot of amazing vegan restaurants, so again, I have high expectations.  The servers were kind and helpful.  The place is clean and comfortable. The menu is huge, but I was just not pleased with what I got. I ordered the V'eggs Benny for $15 and a side of Sauteed Broccoli for $5.    My side of broccoli came first and it was obviously steamed, not sauteed (and in a microwave, I assume).   Then the Benny came. It definitely didn't look as I had expected it to.  I've attached a picture.  On the menu, it says it comes with made from scratch hollandaise sauce.  While I appreciate things made from scratch, this was large mound of virtually flavorless fluff, whose texture mirrored that of the mashed potatoes underneath.  (Also found it strange that everything was in a huge heap, mashed potatoes on the bottom.)   Hollandaise sauce is supposed to be lemon-y and flavorful. Plus, there are so many delicious vegan mayo alternatives that could be used as a base.  Anyway, to enjoy my meal, I ended up scraping most of the \"sauce\" off and covering it with sriracha and it was ok. Not worth $15, in my opinion, but ok.  My hopes are that they improve and keep growing in popularity because we need yummy and healthy vegan food! My suggestions: serve things as described, maybe have a smaller menu with only the things that they make really well and can keep in stock?  Quality over quantity, basically.    I will be back in Vegas tomorrow and might give another item on the menu a try.",

When I saw the menu online I was super stoked at the variety and the many vegan options available.  I tried to order the coconut curry soup.  They didn't have that soup nor any of the soups on the menu. They had just chili. I thought maybe they should take it the soup selection off the menu and just refer to it as soup of the day. There were about 9 diff soups on the menu.  I ordered the cauliflower buffalos bbq wings with fries and those were delicious.  Tried to order the cinnamon buns called nice buns on the menu. Waiter replied he wasn't sure if they had it and checked with the kitchen. He returned saying they used the wrong yeast, it didn't rise, so they don't have it today.  Then I tried to order a milkshake. He said they don't have milkshakes anymore and they've been meaning to take it off the menu. I chose to leave without dessert.  1 item available, which was a second choice, out of 4 I requested.  At some point it's just False advertisement on the menu.  Again part of the reason I was stoked to try this place was because of the variety and amount of options available which in the end didn't exist.",

    "text": "After four long months of convincing Randall to go out with me again after our last visit to Applebees, he finally took me out. He admitted he had been distant due to the extra labia that grew on my left side, so he took it upon himself to take me to Oahu, where we sat in sun rays and I waited for my pina colada that never came. But he DEF made up for it later. I yelped and found \"TMV\" nearby. I'm still not sure what it stands for yet. We walked into TMV without ressoz but they sat us immediately, in the cold dark corner of the room with no light. Randall knew this would upset me because I am a REALLYY good food photographer. He wrapped his phone in old, used toilet paper that was in his tight pant pocket, turned on his phone to light my cocktail \"Plant Killer\".  We ordered the Ruben (which they said they had but replaced as a cold sandwich) & six minutes later, Randall got his food. He ordered the Vegan Louisiana Fried Chickies. He made an immaculate choice. He only gave me a few pieces because he's a greedy mother fucker but he paid so I let him get away with it.   Shandy gave us the Vegan Desert menu and we chose the peanut butter cookie dough with the vanilla ice cream. This was a bad choice. It was delicious but the second we ate it Randall got fat ankles and I got pregnant. We had to leave immediately. He convinced me to go on a walk, and I had to keel. I have attached a photo below of me having food farts.",

Although I saw the prices were pretty high, I decided we should treat ourselves. The environment was decidedly hipster- clean, white, minimal, with bumpin' music.  We all chose something different: beet appetizer and pasta salad, corn dog appetizer, pulled pork sandwich, chick'n and waffles, and plain waffles with berries/walnuts. For dessert, we had cookie dough/ice cream and cheesecake trio.   Every single thing was AMAZING. Especially that friggin' pulled pork sandwich. My omnivore partner keeps dreaming about it! I mean, so do I... that \"pork\" had the same mouthfeel and taste if it's animal counterpart.   Only issues I had (though they were small): mashed potatoes were actually large chunks of undercooked potatoes, hot dogs used with corn dogs had a slightly odd taste (I think they used one of the more \"meh\" brands of veggie dogs), waffles were very soft/vegan butter was very hard. Oh, and yeah, the desserts were very, very overpriced for what you get.   To date, TMV is the BEST \"junk food\" vegan restaurant I've been to. YUM.",

My wife got the Reuben which is one of her favorites but they burnt the bread, she wasn't satisfied with it.  The only thing that was good was the potato skins and that's the only reason why I gave one star.

It took 30 minutes just to put in a drink order and after that an additional hour no food had arrived at the table yet. I'm usually very patient and understanding. I honestly didn't even want anything for free but the way it was handled really rubbed me the wrong way. I had to cancel my order so I wasn't late for work and it was like no one cared on their end I didn't even receive an apology.",

And to be honest, The Modern Vegan's menu selection, portion sizes, and flavors blow all the other options out of the water.  Today was their Grand Opening, and they definitely still have some kinks to work out: 1hr + wait times for food, blenders not arrived yet for smoothies, broken juicer, etc...but honestly, what restaurant doesn't have a crazy first day/month?  The food was SO WORTH THE WAIT. Let me stress that. We ordered quite a few items and when they finally did come, it was heaven.",

I feel this is a restaurant that was created to cash in as the vegan lifestyle grows and that it has nothing to do with the ethical and conscientious reasons that people are vegans in the first place. I've eaten in vegan restaurants all over the United States and the staff and the people preparing food or working in a restaurant that serves plant-based food because it is part of their lifestyle and it comes from a place of integrity. This place lacks integrity on every level. we ask that one item be removed from our bill because it did not taste good and wasn't prepared well. No more than a couple of bites were taken of a Portobello sandwich. The waitress refused and when I ask to see the manager she threatened to call the police.  It's also located in an area that does not feel safe or welcoming. Vegenation, Chef Kenny's, Violets Vegan are far better choices for plant-based dining.  The owners of these restaurants opened them to share this way of eating with others not to turn a quick buck.",

Not only is this place open hella late now, but they serve ultra  vibey tunes and an all-around chill atmosphere with their delicious vegan fare. Shoutout to the cute bartender, Chris, workin' his magic in a glass near you until the early morn!  The decor (and even the dishes) are very IKEA, but the food definitely makes up for it.

    "text": "Our first time at the Modern Vegan.  The food here is very tasty. We had the \"meatball\" hero and the Ruben sandwich, a falafel with sweet potato fries and salads.  Their Ruben is a very good facsimile of the real thing.  They use a great marble rye bread, real sauerkraut, and a vegan cheese.  The \"meat\" had a sweet smoky note like a tad of BBQ sauce was used to flavor it and pull it closer to real corned beef.  I would have loved some russian dressing, and also a critical detail that was left out... deli mustard.  French's Yellow mustard just does not get me there. Now the \"meatball\" hero, sub, grinder or whatever you want to call it was great. I loved the sauce and the \"meatballs were delicious. Its super messy but so what? Dive in and enjoy. The falafel is a solid choice. Its not  heavily seasoned so you may want some hot sauce. The sweet potato fries initially came out cold. But our server replaced the basket with some awesome super crispy piping hot fries instantly. I also saw the \"chicken\" and waffles and they look downright insane. Salads are fresh too.  The service here can be a little slow but thats ok by me.  Settle in with a drink and relax. All the servers are super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and responsive.  Overall, this restaurant is a significant advance for the Vegas vegan community and deserves a serious look. We will be back soon. Free parking in the lot out front. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Amazing service and delicious food. Besides the coleslaw being underdressed and peppery, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and Louisiana Fried Chicken with mash potatoes and gravy were scrump!  The ambiance is really modern and clean. The hostess and waiters all smile and very nice. Our waitress even told us what they are no longer serving and was very knowledgeable about the menu. The food came out in about 10-15 minutes which we are willing to wait for because the food is made to order.   And of course, as with most vegan restaurants, the majority of items are soy based. Not the best option but considering I only eat halal meat which is not easy to come by, I didn't complain.   I'm predicting this place will have lines out the door in a couple weeks ... Mark my words!",

    "text": "If you have allergies, AVOID this place.   My girlfriend and I came here because she has several allergies including allergies to milk, eggs and gluten. Usually a vegan place would be ideal because they don't use eggs or milk. So we decided to come here.   Before ordering anything, we gave the waiter a card where we wrote down all of her allergies. We carry this EVERYWHERE we go and use it in ALL of the restaurants we go to.   Having that said, we asked the waiter on recommendations that would be suitable for her. At the end, we decided to have one of their gluten free breakfast bowl. The menu said it was served with gluten free cereal, and we thought so too because we have gluten free oatmeal and cereal at home all the time. It was after eating that we found out that the cereal was actually not gluten free. Unfortunately, her allergies take a while to manifest in her body so it wasn't until that night when she started to have an attack and had to take her to the Emergency Room. My girlfriend spent the night in the hospital and ruined our entire vacation in Vegas. After bringing up the issue with the restaurant, they said that they were not responsible and wouldn't offer any support for what happened. I would've hoped they offered some kind of support as the hospital bill wasn't cheap and even though she is OK, one of this allergic attacks can potentially kill her or leave her in the hospital for months.",

    "text": "On a sunny Friday afternoon, the day after its grand opening, my SO and I decided to drive a half hour to try the hot, new restaurant boasting vegan comfort food--an offering that isn't as widely available in Las Vegas as it is in other vegan-friendly cities. Let me start by saying that the menu has an overwhelming number of options, although, nothing compared to the infamous Cheesecake Factory Bible (thank goodness).  As we sat down in the starkly white and monochromatic, IKEA-furnished establishment, I thought to myself that ordering JUST a few dishes would be devastating. But as our smiling server greeted us, she mentioned a long list of items that they were out of. To be quite frank, this was indeed a blessing. The less I had to choose from, the less conflict in my taste buds! Our limited yet still quite varied list of choices allowed us to enjoy three following items: the Louisiana fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy (no coleslaw for me!), a vegan lobster roll with a mountain of French fries, and a heaping side of baked mac and cheese.  Now, I'm not quite sure what it is about this establishment, but I found it so endearing. Maybe it was the Mockelby table in the far end of the room? The millions of pillows nesting on one lonely couch? The strange chain curtains separating the bar? Perhaps the wooden shelves hidden out of plain sight, or the sound of early-2000s Mariah melting into the background of a \"modern\" atmosphere? Stepping into The Modern Vegan, you forget you're on Nellis and are immediately immersed into a different world, the only reminder being your 8-year-old vehicle parked outside the window.  How much do you enjoy eating? If the answer is a lot, then wait-time could be a critical factor to your experience. We found ours to be relatively short. A mere 15 minutes after ordering, a baked mac and cheese was set in front of us, served in a piping-hot, cast-iron pan. It had that quintessential, crumb-top layer that mac and cheese is best known for. And while I thought it lacked cheesiness and needed a pinch of salt, I did in fact eat every single piece of elbow pasta on that pan. The vegan lobster roll didn't taste too much like it's seafood counterpart, but I thought the lobster mixture itself was refreshing and tasty. Add to that, a mountain of fried potato strips... I must admit I've never once met a French fry that I didn't like.   The True star to me, though, was the fried \"chicken\". I've had many-a-vegan-fried-chik'n's in the past few years of eating a plant based diet and I have to give it to this one. The Modern Vegan nails the batter, the seasoning, and overall flavor. To me, this was just right. It was crisp, but somehow light, and I couldn't help but to think about how a chunk of soy protein isolate could possibly be so, dare I say it... moist? On this spring-sunny day in March, somebody in The Modern Vegan kitchen knew how to work that deep fryer. A pepper-y gravy and some fluffy mashed potatoes complimented the crunchy, crispy, tender and flavorful vegan chicken. I was content. No animals were harmed.  The portions here met the \"American standard\". So much so that after licking each plate clean, the thought of ordering from their list of desserts would have been overkill for two rather petite individuals. Nevertheless, knowing I even had the choice was plenty promising. Seriously, check out those desserts! While The Modern Vegan is not perfect, and is at times reminiscent of a club, it has the potential to be such a great asset to the Las Vegas vegan community. I am definitely returning to The Modern Vegan with a bigger party to try and make my way through their menu. Give it a shot! I'm sure you'll find something you'll like.",

Im not vegan, but my friend Alexis took me there three times in three days, and the food is delicious and amazing! It's hidden at the southerly end of the Strip, but worth the Uber ride down. The menu is incredibly diverse. Ask Susie for her favorites, like the Louisiana fried chicken, baked mac'n'cheese, jalapeno poppers. Alexis' favorite dessert is the \"Oh My God\" gooey hot fudge brownie with ice cream and peanuts. My dessert was the deep fried peanut butter'n'jelly  sandwich! For those of us who aren't vegan, don't think \"vegan,\" just think \"fabulous food!\" Break away for your ordinary routine and experience this exceptional restaurant while you are in Las Vegas!",

    "text": "This was the last restaurant we hit before leaving LV on an epic weekend!  The menu is massive making it hard to choose!  But choose we did. We started with jalapeno poppers. I was excited since I haven't had these in years. They are advertised with bacon. I did not see or taste this.  However I did see lots of seeds left In the center making it unbearable for me to eat. My husband ate them all thee were 4 minus the one bite I took. They were fire hot. It kind of ruined his stomach for anything else unfortunately. So be ware if you order these. They don't clear the seeds!  Next I order comfort food. A nice plate of Luisiana \"chicken\" with mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy. The plate was massive which was cool. Lots of mashed potatoes. However when I took a bite the potatoes weren't really \"mashed\" like we know mashed potatoes to be. They were more like a plate of smashed boiled potatoes. No flavor no creamy taste or texture. They were chunked half finished potatoes . This was a bummer. I ask the waitress to give me butter and salt so I can try and salvage this meal. But even that was hard. I had to smash my food with a fork and add butter and salt and extra gravy just to give it flavor. She never offered to take the plate back to the kitchen or replace it.  She just said \"oh yeah that shouldn't be like that\". I have not reason to say why I didn't ask to send it back. I was tired and wanted food in my belly so we could start the 6 hour drive home at 8 pm in a Sunday night. Anyhow needless to say she didn't even offer to take the meal off our bill even when we said it was less than edible. The chicken and gravy was okay, But without mashies it's just not the same. She gave us a 2.60$ \"military\" discount as a way of making it better. Anyhow I was a little disappointed .  I didn't even take a picture of my plate to share on social because it was that bad. Service was \"meh\". The waitress should have done everything to make our experience better not act like she had no control over what was happening.",

We visited on a Monday morning and were seated immediately. While we had the option of ordering a beverage, we decided to forego it, as we would be getting bubble tea afterwards. We ended up ordering two Portobello Lasagnas and an Acai Parfait.   The portobello lasagna was displayed in such a beautiful manner, and it tasted absolutely specular. The portioning was just right for me, while my friends ended up splitting their portobello lasagna and acai parfait with one another.  The acai parfait looked delicious, although my friend did note that a good portion of it was frozen, so heads up on that. It made it a bit challenging to eat, as the chill slowed down the process. My friend said she would've ordered something else had she realized the parfait would be frozen.   Overall, good experience and would love to go back and try some other dishes!",

I brought hubby , he ordered All American burger on pretzel bun / fries and I ordered the Buddha bowl salad !!!!  Hubbys burger came out and we shared it because I waited so long . I eventually had to tell the server ( Kimmi) to cancel the salad .  ALSO WHILE WE WERE WAITING, for our order I see Kimmi the server picking up a Little infant babygirl & holding it in front of the food pick up order line and was just talking like it's visiting hour she gave the baby back to the table she got it from and comes over to tell us food will be out soon ; and I had to ask her to please wash her hands because of baby diapers and clothes carry lots of germs because babies do crawl around on grounds...... Wow IT WAS A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE !  I don't know if I even want to come back or not PLUS SHE didn't didn't even apologize for me not getting my Salad she said it's a Freestyle Kitchen and the food comes out whenever it's ready. LOL REALLY BASICALLY MEANING The COOKS Will GET TI IT WHEN THERE F_#%*N READY    THAT IS NOT THE BUSINESS  .... YEAH TRY TELLING a real EXECUTIVE CHEF THAT !!!",

    "text": "AVOID IF YOU HAVE ALLERGIES!!!! I really wanted to like this place. But they tried to kill me with their negligence.   I am very allergic to onion and garlic -- I'm in town for a conference and there aren't a lot of options for me to order takeout, which is why I was excited when I saw TMV on UberEats. I ordered the Buddha Bowl (which has red onions in its description). I added a note about my allergies and then called the restaurant to verify that they had seen the note and could make the dish without onions/garlic. The woman who answered the phone put me on hold to chat with the kitchen to make sure. When she came back on the line she said it wouldn't be a problem for them. I double-checked and said that I'm allergic so no onions/garlic and no dressing (just  plain vinegar). She verified again with me and assured me that they could handle it. My food arrived and I didn't see any onions (at first). I poured on the vinegar, cut up the salad, closed the lid and shook to \"toss\" it. I started eating and after several bites (I was starving), I noticed a piece of diced red onion. I picked it out and then began using my fork to look around the rest of the bowl. Low and behold, there were more than a few pieces of diced red onions in my salad. This is so critical because eating onions (even in powder form) will close my throat.  If someone tells you they have an allergy and you assure them you can comply; you need to be vigilant in making sure the allergens don't get into their food. If you can't comply, TELL THEM. A $10 sale isn't worth putting someone's life at risk (nor the lawsuit that would follow should something terrible happen). Luckily, I realized the negligence before it got to that point, but this could've ended very badly for me. Do better.",

It's not in the best neighborhood, but I wasn't going to let that dissuade me from going.   When we arrived, 80% of the tables were empty, yet we were told they were running behind and there was a wait. We waited about ten minutes to be seated, at which point we were told the restaurant was out of a lot of things from the weekend, including avocado, and hadn't gotten their food delivery today. So several of the items we wanted to order were unavailable.   Our food took about 30 minutes to arrive, despite a mostly empty restaurant. My order came with sweet potato fries, even though I didn't order them. The server offered to make it right, but I was fine eating them. The food was good, but it didn't live up to expectations. I wanted to be blown away, but it fell short.   Overall, the food was good and the staff was pleasant. I'd eat here again, but I'd definitely temper my expectations in the future.",

We sat down to a wonderfully large menu with food and beverages (They have AH-MAZING beverages by the way!) Now, I'm allergic to just about everything under the sun, and it's super hard for me to eat ANYWHERE, but Laurie and Chris were so kind and patient with me and got to know my allergies. They made sure I would be taken care of, and it made me feel so special! The chef who prepared my meal was so great too! The food I had was amazing. The best tofu scramble and sweet potato fries I've ever had. Not kidding! We were so blown away by out experience! The customer service was top notch, 5 stars. Water was refilled every time we needed more, and we were checked up on perfectly. The bathrooms were clean and well maintained. You can tell the staff take pride in the restaurant! Because of the warm welcome and the amazing food, we now can't wait to go back! 10/10 highly recommended! Thanks Laurie, Chris, and the awesome chefs who took care of us this evening!!",

One random experience here that happened a few weeks ago occurred when they bring us the Gia waffles and there's almost zero syrup on it, kinda just tasted like sweet bread at that point. whatever no biggie, so i tell the waitress the waffles are a little dry and ask to get some more syrup... \"okay its gonna be 75 cents if you want more\" lol what? i'm expressing that i'm not fully satisfied with the waffles and your gonna charge me for it? i guarantee the blonde owner in the kitchen purposely puts such a small amount on the waffles knowing almost everyone will want more. 75 cents for 2 tablespoons of syrup surely adds up. yeah probably not gonna eat here again the more i think about it. i've regretfully given this place about $300 of my dollars, yikes.",

The owner of the purse arrived within seconds and moved her purse right back to it's original space. Right then I felt uncomfortable and disrespected as a human being. After my company and i decided to stay despite what I witnessed. I also noticed the waitress whispering to the lady who's purse she moved. Soon after we were approached by the same woman waitress. At this point I'm feeling really  uncomfortable. She comes back and tells us that her establishement did not allow open containers. My fellow conterpart had a bottle of alkaline water. So you mean to tell me alkaline water is not allowed in a vegan restaurant? Instead, we requested water and restaurant policy. However, we were served a glass of warm water with no ice. And we did not receive a written policy, nor did the manager seem interested in serving us. We will not be returning to this establishment again.

    "text": "I read the reviews and complaints, but wanted something different on Mother's Day. The service was actually great, with our table being pre-bussed, all food brought correctly and in a timely manner. Any server available checked on us, as well as the manager, and even the hostess. Our specific server was very helpful, and knowledgeable of the large menu, giving great recommendations. She even had a great sense of humor for our jokes, with a few of her own. My \"know it all\" cocktail was delicious. We ordered an appetizer, breakfast items (available all day), a lunch item and dessert. The lobster roll was actually very good, once your brain gets that it isn't lobster on the 2nd bite and just acknowledges that the flavors are still tasty. The nacho cheese sauce was not our fave, but the rest of the ingredients were good. The biscuits and gravy were delicious and I was so thankful for the suggestion. The banana split, perfect. Real french fries, are always a plus. Portion sizes are sharable, which makes for a great experience. I was so happy we didn't let the reviews deter us, that we went again within a week. My carnivorous teen devoured her meatball sandwich, barely wanting to share. Same with her waffles, which she said were the best ever. The flavor of the falafel was surprisingly fresh and tasty, though the bread maybe just slightly tough, but would still order again. The Italian sandwich was perfectly light and fresh for the 90 day, with their pesto butter adding dimension. The place is bright and clean inside, and they are the perfect gateway to plant-based eating for those who aren't committed yet. Unlike similar places, they have regular sodas, which was a plus for my coke drinking husband. There is a full bar, with tvs that showed a variety of interesting content. My only suggestion would be to please add seat covers to the restrooms. Also, I don't enjoy them being co-ed restrooms, but I won't complain because I know I'm just weird like that lol it is helpful to grab whichever is available, after all. I only wish we didn't live on the other side of town, but my wallet is probably thankful because we'd probably be there again today. There are so many more items we're looking forward to trying. The scene is growing in town, and hopefully TMV will be around for the duration. Worth the drive!",

She was rude over the phone asking \"What do you want?\" When I had already told her what I actually wanted (and asked in my usual nice way). I feel bad because I know it's such a popular place to eat and the food is AMAZING. And I know she could have had a bad 2 days in a row, I don't know. She just didn't even smile at customers. We got the vegan breakfast burrito and biscuits and gravy. (:",

    "text": "I really wanted to enjoy this place because from what I've heard/seen on Yelp-- the food looked really good and the menu was budget friendly. The food (from what I've ordered-- Gia waffle) and the Cosmopolitan smoothie we had, it was good. Mainly because waffles are my favorite things to eat.. but the my opinion of the Cosmopolitan drastically changed my view of the place and several of the coworkers who were there (at the time we were there). I want to say... before I go further, I do have a severe nut allergy. Before I went vegan, I had a terrible experience after eating a Ferrero rocher truffle and accidentally consuming nuts while I was at a mixed vegan fusion restaurant in LA... so I was unpleasantly surprised with how the staff handled the situation.  At first, when we ordered the Gia waffles I initially asked for the nuts to be removed from the dish. Thinking we were done ordering (because we were just going to ask for a milkshake afterwards) our waiter took our menus. Being out of stock, he politely said so and we didn't take it badly but we just asked for a recommendation on the smoothies (which is why I was unable to view the ingredients of the drink). He recommended the Cosmopolitan so we just ordered that. The second our food came and the smoothie, I took a sip and instantly recognized the strong flavor of nuts. Being cautious, I immediately waved for the attention of one of the servers out and asked about the ingredients (because of my allergy). Going to the chef then returning, she said there were no nuts in it. I didn't trust her-- because of how strong the flavor was, and I was 100% certain that the flavor of almond milk wasn't that potent. (I know I'm fine with almond and pistachios which is why none of the other smoothies didn't really concern me or the ones I've read that contained 'almond milk'.)   Fortunately, I didn't experience any severe allergic reaction from consuming the smoothie. But after knowing that the one of the servers lied-- just because she was afraid of something happening that wasn't even her fault, angered me. The smoothie contained peanut butter. So yes, it did contain a nut other than almonds. The food here is enjoyable but if anyone has a nut allergy, I strongly recommend to either not eat here or to be extremely careful with what you order.",

You could please many kinds of folks right there. F) Online ordering, yay.  K, so, when it comes to the actual food, I have mixed opinions. But I will be back to try more, so obviously I'm not that miffed. I think it would be best for me to individually explain the zeniths & nadirs of what we got.  The presentation of everything was high-end, and the portion sizes were awesome. I wouldn't complain regarding the price when it comes to the Chxn & Waffles, 'cuz that is a metric f#ckton of food. But, when it came to the Baked Macaroni, I felt jipped. If it were cheaper, I woulda ordered more things (curious about the Jalapeno poppers & the other 862 menu items, lol). In a way, their pricing is losing sight of that fact. Maybe in the future, they can offer a mixed appetizer dish for somebody like me who just wants to try a bunch of fried apps & get my feet wet.  The Chxn (of Le Chxn & Waffle platter extravaganza) was bomb-diggity, and the very best thing on either plate. The mash was acceptable, but needed some more love via fat & salt. I was glad they weren't too pasty & weren't instant, 'cuz there is no frickin' excuse for that. The waffles & asparagus weren't bad. Bacon coulda been crispier. All in all, 4/5.  The Baked Mac; however, had this really strong flavor, and once I had enough, I just couldn't look past it. It was supposed to be \"bacon\"-flavored, but honestly, it was like, cumin-chipotle-chorizo-tapwater. It also needed salt. Sigh. It coulda been good, too, and appealed to more palates if it were \"plainer\" or whatnot. Maybe offer two versions? Idk. And the parsley cheese topping looked so nice. I was disappointed. I coulda handled some bacon bits, but the flavor mix permeated every elbow macaroni, like woah.  I'm a fatty. I'll be back anyway.",

It is very near the UNLV campus, and frankly, the menu was so big, I think I would probably have to go here 50 times before I could try Everything. What caught My eye immediately was Florentine with mashed potatoes. I am a sucker for mashed potatoes. This dish was beautiful, beautifully presented, great blend of flavors, appetizing in every way, and extremely filling. I had intended to get dessert but forget that. The mashed potatoes were creamy, mashed with skin on, and they had a great flavor from the combination of the other vegetables in this dish. No, I did not lick the plate...  The decor is beautiful clean, black and white, a metaphor for what our food choices should be. Black and white, food is either healthy or it isn't.  The background music is what you would expect for a college location, and the big screen TVs all around displayed adorable animal pictures.  And added bonus, free coffee refills! I completely enjoyed this experience and have every intention to return.",

We started with the avocado trifecta which was tasty. My wife got the made to order waffles which were probably the best vegan waffles we have ever eaten. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich. The servings are huge! Two people could easily split one entree.   Overall we had a very nice experience. The atmosphere was nice and the food was very good.   We will definitely come back.",

The bartender (Lindsey I believe )on the other hand wanted to help but also tried to give me a guilt trip that the waiter has to pay out of pocket for the fries being remade because the owners don't like if something had to get returned .

My honey had the buffalo chicken sammy with a salad and liked it well enough. But felt the avocado should've been pureed so as to not make the toppings fall off. The environment was relaxed and clean. The waitstaff was friendly and polite. We had a server with a necklace on that said angel and she was very attentive with out being pushy, and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and even recommended her favorites on the menu. Very good selection and variety of food. Super delish all vegan fare! We will be back next time were in Vegas! So yummy! Thanks TMV!",

I'd say you don't need the double. The single patty is good enough. I had the fried PB & J and it's was just too much food. I much prefer a Normal PB&J, as I also felt the peanut butter overpowered the sandwich. This place is good, but contrary to my bias (which is of course ignorant), vegan doesn't mean light. Order like you'd order anywhere else and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Don't just order a lot because you think it's \"vegan\" so de facto lighter than actual meat based staples. I Loved the food, service and cutest decor all over the walls. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "The texture for the imitation meat stuff is great, food is hot and presented well, however, this place is pricey.  This is more a first impression, or first few visits review.  The location is weird cuz the neighboring businesses are ghetto or the rowdy gay bars.  The moment you go inside the property it's like you're not in east Vegas or the Tropicana paradise area.    The music Is upbeat and chill but not my preference.  It's the popular music for the kids-30 year olds  The clientele is mixed, which shows that this place needed to be here cuz there are a lot more plant based diet foodies in the area.  Fries are hot and well cooked but they're too salty.  They need like paprika or something.  I wish they would offer condiments other than Heinz ketchup.   The jerk chicken has a great texture and taste to the meat and cheese but it doesnt taste just like jamaican jerk.  More of a subtle American eh.  Reuben texture was great but still needs something.  Still one of the best vegan reubens ever.  Mac and cheese was also tasty, but wasnt as hot and gooey as I pictured it when ordering.  Packed house or busy, means the lighting is super bright like a museum and I'm not into it.  When it slows down the lighting is much more intimate and more my taste.  They have a bar here with your usual drinks.  It would be cool to see more specialty cocktails or special stash, high end liquor too.  The seating areas vary,  the majority of the seats are nice but not the most comfortable.  They are light and easy to move but need handles.  The decor isnt my cup of tea, but it is well placed and caters to the modern vegan, hence the name.  The whole feeling of the place is basically for the namesake.   Expect the servers to focus more on the large groups.  They are great but not top tier.  I purchase vegetables and cook vegan food.  So I know that what you're paying for here is mainly ambiance and hanging out.  Great spot for the UNLV guys, artists, young foodies and all that.  For me I think it still needs more. And to have more appropriate pricing.",

I thought the burger came with a meat patty, but it's actually just a portobello mushroom. I was surprised, but it was great when I added the meat patty to it. A little too cheesy in my opinion, but good. Dessert was okay, I wish it was more of an apple pie crumble , not just an apple crumble. Definitely, will come back to try other items on the menu.

We had some coffee and  the chicken and waffles which we split and was phenominal, also had zucchinni fritters, buddah bowl, loaded queso, and buffalo chicken sandwhich. There was nothing that i didnt enjoy and i wish i had more room to eat because I could of stayed there all day and ate! Haha. They offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner with a wide menu. Also have appetizers, smoothies and cocktails. The staff was amazing and attentive! Check this place out!!!! You can't go wrong!",

The menu choices were just overwhelming, narrow the menu down and work on bringing good taste to those items. Ordered the V'eggs Benny and mac n cheese baseballs. The v'eggs benny-everything except their Hollandaise sauce no flavor what so ever. The mac n cheese baseballs was an epic disappointment. Just the thought of them makes me cringe. Unlike v'eggs benny they had a flavor, a very very bad flavor. Like seriously how can you serve that to people.Spent almost 50$ on food I couldn't even eat (I don't mind spending money on food, if the food is worth it) If you're going to serve such flavorless food at least and put some salt and pepper on the table lol.  As far as the atmosphere, the place looks super cute, clean and the girls that served us were cool and polite.",

    "text": "I am really excited that Las Vegas is gaining more and more vegan restaurants to ease our minds as we make our decisions for dinner throughout the week. I do think that new restaurants need to do more research about owning a restaurant as a whole before they open the doors. Great food is not the only thing that will keep your business going. You need to have the fundamentals of customer service, execution and presentation of your food and restaurant, and inventory down pat or you'll risk losing a lot of potential clientele simply because you were either ignorant or ill-prepared.  That being said, The Modern Vegan has a very clean look when you walk in, and the staff seems friendly. I was greeted by the hostess immediately who showed me to the bar, which I was excited and surprised to see was a full-service bar. The bartender was also friendly and polite, but you can tell that is stressed out for very a good reason. I sat down close to the food window, and just paid attention while I read through the menu. I will say that I am huge about making sure I don't hear any work drama in front of customers, and I wasn't happy to hear someone yell at the servers about not picking up food fast enough from the window. Say whatever you want, but do not do it in front of customers. It's embarrassing for the employee and kind of sets an aggressive tone around your space.  Back to the menu. It's a massive menu; too massive, if you ask me. Not only was it a lot for me to take in, but it was obviously too much for the kitchen to handle. Half of the items that I ordered were 86'd, including all of their 8 or so soups except for one, two appetizers, the cocktail I ordered, and one sandwich. And that's just based off of what I ordered and overheard people discussing. What I ended up with was the stuffed avocado appetizer, a side of Mac n cheese, and a raw carrot cake Togo.  The food came out quick. I wasn't a fan of the bits in the Mac n cheese, but it was a solid side dish. The avocado I probably wouldn't order again either. There was something in it that was very salty. So I just dumped out the tofu scramble and ate the avocado plain.  That raw carrot cake was probably my favorite thing. It's actually amazing. I would call back to order it Togo, but I did overhear someone on the phone tell the customer that she wouldn't do any take out orders.  I'm honestly not coming back for a while, until the buzz dies down and they figure some things out. I get that a new business needs to learn, which is why I'm reiterating that before opening up a business, some research needs to be done. If all you have is one soup, then do a soup of the day. Don't try to keep up with that huge menu. Customers get disgruntled if they can get what they want, and my second and third choices will never taste as good as what I originally wanted to dine in for.  I want to see vegan restaurants thrive in Las Vegas. Hopefully whenever I come back, I can edit this review and tell you how wonderful everything is.",

I just want to take the time to say to whoever is in charge of this establishment that your employee Kylie is simply amazing. I walked into the modern vegan not expecting it to be as busy as it was so I thought I'd be waiting forever to be seated and eat. But the she managed that full busy restaurant so well I was seated in no time! And it was such a happy atmosphere for how packed it was, generally there's almost an upsetting vibe to packed restaurant especially when people find out they have to \"wait.\" She was very quick and efficient with everything that she did to get us seated as fast as possible. She even recommended the buffalo burger as something I should try and it was absolutely amazing!!! I can see why it's a popular item. I will definitely be coming back here next time I have a Vegas trip and recommend anyone reading this to head there if you want excellent customer service with a smile!",

Food: The food was decent, but I had to scour the menu for something that was not over processed chemical versions of omnivore food. As a vegan, I wish vegan restaurants would embrace vegetables, nut cheeses, tofu, etc. and NOT processed fake meats and chicken. The menu is extensive and the restaurant is missing half the ingredients. The waitress must have returned to the table five times to say they were out of something.   Service: At first, our service was just fine, but then the waitress got busy. Not her fault at all. But while I sat there for twenty minutes after finishing my food, waiting for the check, I could not help but notice the four people behind the bar doing nothing. One was looking over ordering and appeared to be the owner. This is for you: help your employees! It looks so bad and is irritating to watch one waitress cover ten tables while the rest of you stand around.   Prices: WAY overpriced for what it is, honestly.   I won't return.

Our server was helpful and attentive in making suggestions and letting us know what the favorites were. There was a bit of an issue with two people in our parties orders. The kitchen was out of pretzel buns. This was fine and they opted for the only other option given to them, sourdough. Our server came back saying the chef suggested they pick something else as their sandwich / burger choices were tailored to that bread choice. Understandable. They picked something else. We also split the nachos between the 4 of us with bits left on the platter. Our food came out in a timely manner, two at a time as the orders were out in. I got the chickn' and waffles... so good. Hit the spot on all levels of sweet and savory. And it's a tower of food see photo! Totally shareable. I didn't fully know what to expect but was happy to see asparagus and a bed of mashed potatoes that soak up some of the syrup... perfect. We also tried that Mac n cheese and weren't impressed there. The Ruben was good but the other sandwich at the table was not a big hit. The menu has something for everyone and a bit more. You can enjoy an adult beverage of grab wellness shots and smoothies.

So to my great surprise, my wife researched and found some key spots she wanted to try on her first trip here. She picked a WINNER with TMV!  This is now my favorite place in Vegas! We ordered the Saucy Cauliflower Wings (which comes with fries),...delicious!   My wife ordered the Louisiana Fried Chicken, which comes with mashed potatoes and a mushroom-sausage gravy,... I sampled some of her plate and almost wish I had ordered the same, so tasty!  I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak w/fries,.... equally as tasty!   The price was $14-15 for each item we ordered, and WELL worth it as TMV gives you HEALTHY portions that don't disappoint and make it hard to finish your plate. I saw another patron who ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs, and I regret my stomach isn't big enough to eat all of that in one sitting so Spaghetti and Meatballs is on my list to order when I come back.   Thanks TMV, cooks and staff, for making my return trip to Vegas and my wife's first trip so satisfying!   5 stars from me for the large variety of menu options, the delicious taste, large portions and decent price and atmosphere.",

    "text": "Had to try the new talk of the town in the vegan Vegas community since I was in town this weekend! 1st off, don't get discouraged from the off the beaten path location because once you step through their doors, it's very visually appealing. A modern diner feel with lounge couches! I almost plopped on one after my meal! Speaking of meals, I ordered the popular vegan chicken & waffles. OMG, living in Cali has made me forget how big Vegas does it because I couldn't even finish the whole thing! The waffles were crispy on the outside & chewy inside, the chicken was thick & cooked to crispy perfection, in between the waffles were 2 strips of what looked & tasted live Veggie Life bacon, and they put a heaping scoop of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then drizzled maple syrup on top!  Will absolutely, definitely swing by again because their menu is huge & everything sounded tasty",

    "text": "I had high hopes.   The location was easy to find and easy to park.   The menu is huge, \"we don't know what we specialize in\" huge.  They were out of a lot of food when we went. The way that was presented to us was like this was already a norm.  An entree will run you $15.00 a plate.   Our server was not attentive whatsoever.. she seemed a little clueless, she took our order for coffee and food, someone else brought out our food, not at the same time but in reasonable enough time that it was ok but we never saw our server again until we waved her down for our bill 25 mins later where she returned and asked if we wanted to order more food..   I wanted ketchup, a refill on coffee, a spoon for my coffee, but I had almost eaten it all by then. But no I didn't want to order more food. Weird.   In the meantime, a manager, possibly owner or just a much more attentive server passed and asked if we wanted more coffee, and asked how our food was which gave us the opportunity to tell him that our experience wasnt too good. He asked if we had \"asked\" for any ketchup.. and to that I hope he realized that it was hard enough to finally get some more coffee.. no one was available in our direction and for half of our sitting, we believed someone would come eventually.  My burrito was cold with cold ingredients intentionally making it that temp. I could tell it was on purpose, cold beans, lettuce, lots of pico, a little bit of chkn but yet it was a cold burrito and therefore it should be called a WRAP. When I told the gentleman who worked there this he seemed surprised that it was cold and went and talked to the cook I think. When he came back he informed us that it was supposed to be cold. I had already come to this conclusion but my point is that it's weird to serve things that are generally hot , cold without fair warning.   Here's the thing, it's new.. it's working through glitches and growing pains. But the bad server with the nose ring and animated features, she's not doing this restaurants name any favor. The menu is too big and it's missing half the things anyway. For $15.00 the breakfast burrito doesn't hold up with any other vegan burrito in town. For $3.00 coffee please refill it at least once.. please offer a spoon and condiments when you bring the food.   This experience was just too bad.",

    "text": "I never thought I would write one of those \"I wish I could give this restaurant 0 stars\" type of review to a vegan restaurant but here it goes.  I followed this restaurant on Instagram because of the infamous @Veganfatkid (follow him because his posts are great). Everything on their IG posts are mouthwatering and look amazing, especially the waffles!!! BUT, I had to remember that IG isn't reality therefore, in person I had a different experience than on-screen led me to believe.   Ambiance: Outside: shady and dark during the night... Inside: The restaurant itself is \"TOO modern\" for me and I'm 21 years old... but this is a biased statement due to my preferences being more rustic-modern vegan restaurant. The ambiance in the restaurant is stressful; white walls that have me uneasy LOL, white tables, and black and white everything... Anxiety ridden ambiance lol.   Service: I probably was the most disappointed because I'm in vegas for vacation and being that it is 100+ degrees outside you would think that the water would be ice cold... lol no. And no prompt refills. lol. Also, no waffles that night (the most exciting thing on the IG page to me). I wanted to try the vegan chickn and waffles and the gia, but no waffles. SAD. But, with an overwhelmingly large menu and zero help from the server I opted for a regular burger.   Food: The burger was good, but beyond meat patties are bomb, so anywhere this would be great, BUT not anything spectacular for the price. SAD. Fries cold, o-rings (underwhelming oil taste and no seasoning). Warning, do not try the pad-thai, skip altogether. Lots of sauce, too sweet and too salty and oily and no noodles all in one bite LOL.   Wanted to try dessert but the serving size was underwhelming for the price... SKIP.  Do not recommend for vegans, non-vegans, vegetarians in the LV area...",

We were visiting the Las Vegas area and found this gem.  We liked it so much, we went there 3 times - in 3 days!  I had the Frenchie - 3 large pieces of french toast smothered in fruit.  The first time it was perfect - just a little syrup, which is how I like it. When we wend back, I ordered it again and it was swimming in syrup - so you might want to ask for the syrup on the side.  Still good, I just don't care for soggy syrupy french toast.  I also tried the avocado toast - twice.  3 large pieces, one with tomato with avocado drizzle, asparagus with drizzle, and one with perfectly sliced avocado.  Again, the first order was perfection!  The second time we went back, while it tasted good, but was not presented as well as the first order and the toppings weren't as generous.  I also had the sweet potato fries, which were MANY, very good and satisfying.  My only critique is consistency.  Again, the menu has MANY selections, the restaurant is small-ish and well stocked with patrons.",

We always try a new place when in Vegas and this trip we went way out of our comfort zone and we are glad we did. The owners were there and were amazing at explaining the menu to us, made suggestions for us since we haven't tried vegan food and were so friendly and helpful. We had the jalapeno poppers for our appetizer, baked Mac and cheese and my husband had the pad Thai. We loved it all. Is there a difference, well in the mac and cheese yes I tasted a difference, but a good difference. My husband is not a mac and cheese fan, but liked this one a lot. My husband was surprised that it wasn't chicken on his plate.  Their drinks are delicious too. We tried Too pretty to work (which was our favorite) and sex on the plane which was great too.  The decor is modern and welcoming. Not far from the strip and vegan or not you should try this place. They have so many options, there is something for everyone.  Wish we had healthy options like this in more cities. A menu with a lot of variety, big portions, great food and drinks. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open late nights some days too.  We will be back on our next trip to try more of their options. We can't wait! Great Job Modern Vegan. You have made us fans!",

    "text": "On a recent vacation to Vegas, finding good vegan food was important. The fact that we went to The Modern Vegan three times in less than 24 hours shows that we found what we were looking for. There are so many awesome aspects to this place that it kept us coming back again and again.   First, the service was beyond impressive. The first time we went, I ordered something that, quite honestly, I just didn't like. It's not that it was bad, because I'm sure it wasn't. It just had coleslaw on it (which I overlooked on the menu...totally my fault), and I get easily nauseated by the taste of it...ANY coleslaw. I explained to the server that I had made a mistake in ordering that plate and that I would like to order something else. I said I would gladly pay for the meal I didn't eat, seeing as it was no fault of theirs. The server (Jessica, I believe) cleared it with the manager, both of whom were very understanding and polite, and I had a different plate (the Pad Thai) in just a few short minutes...which, by the way, was probably the best vegan Pad Thai I've ever had. Furthermore, I was shocked that they didn't charge me for the meal I sent back, even though--again--it was no fault of their own. It's refreshing to come across friendly, thoughtful, and expedient service.   Additionally, The Modern Vegan offers tons of options...literally tons, because their serving sizes are as gigantic as their menu. Not only do they offer breakfast food around the clock (minus their abbreviated late night menu), you have a multitude of options for each meal. Whether you order breakfast at 10PM, dinner at 4AM, or lunch at 9PM, you'll find your plate filled to the brim with larger portions than I've seen literally anywhere else at a vegan restaurant. Two out of the three times we went, we had to take some back to the hotel with us. The portions were so large that you'd get about half way through before you started feeling like a bear shot in the ass with a tranquilizer. You don't stop eating when you're full; you stop when you hate yourself. But it's totally worth it.  As far as price, yes, I know it looks a little above average on the surface. But once you see just how much food you're getting, you'll understand that you are getting far more bang for your buck.   The decor of the place is nice, and I wish they'd set up a shop here in Orange County, CA. Not only would they do VERY well, the chic modern decor would fit in well, too.  I wanted to specifically mention two people before this review is over: Jessica (the server mentioned before) and whoever the manager there is (burly guy with a beard and nose ring). While we interacted with a few other servers there during our three visits, these two were FAR above par. They were friendly, down-to-earth, hilarious, polite, expedient, and made us feel more than welcome every time we went.   We plan on going back to Vegas again soon, and I can say with confidence that we will be eating at The Modern Vegan.",

There were 3 people in our party.. meals came out separately about 10 minutes apart. On top of that, the food was cold. When I tried to explain my dissatisfaction, the owner attacked me personally and made rude remarks. Our server Missy was great but the owner was a total A-hole! I am sure if you look at the owner's low class responses to critical reviews, you will look for other vegan restaurants to support. There are many great vegan restaurants worthy of support but this is definitely not one I would recommend.",

If you order it , I recommend asking for light on the oil/butter/whatever they use to make the sandwich.  It was slightly too oily/greasy for my taste as the bread was basically soaked in some sort of vegan butter. Texture wise it was spot on, sauerkraut was really really delicious, sauce was bomb as well. I'll definitely have to try some other stuff, hopefully something less greasy/oily. The fries that came with it were surprisingly not greasy at all and were fresh! Their menu is huge and definitely the largest vegan menu I've seen in Vegas. What makes them unique is their options, they have a lot of vegan versions of \"normal\" dishes! Looking forward to trying their other dishes and dining in when I get the chance.",

Great, I move on and even if it's bad, fine...I move on and never visit again. And yet, here I find myself wanting very much to beware future diners.   I was visiting town with my brother and his partner and we were quite excited to try this place. Food photos look amazing and we were pretty hungry. All vegan? Yes!!!   What we ordered:   Corn dogs for appetizers The Buffalo Chicken sandwich  The Gyro with fries  The Banh Mi with salad  1. The corn dogs came in 10 minutes. They were yummy. Feeling good about this place. 2. My brother's partner got his fish first - The Buffalo Chicken sandwich.  3. You guys, I'm not exaggerating when I say, it literally took 40 minutes before myself or my brother got our dishes. My brother in law refused to eat his Buffalo Chicken sandwich until we had gotten our food. So his sandwich sat there getting cold for FORTY MINUTES.   I feel like the Kitchen forgot our orders bc the waiter asked what we ordered 20 minutes after we ordered our food originally. We ordered sweet fries while we were waiting for our regular food items bc we were so hungry. We also noticed the table of four to the right of us had the same experience. One woman there ordered noodles and the other three people did. It get their dishes from the kitchen for another 30 minutes. They were eating off of her plate as well bc they were also hungry, I'm sure.   Here's the kicker. Maybe I would of just chalked this up to \"new restaurant/new kitchen kinks\" to work out. I understand those things, I can overlook things but what really made me want to write this undoubtedly is the lack of acknowledgement of what we were experiencing as diners. There was a bald guy with glasses (not our server) who blamed us for not knowing that the Kitchen there was a \"Free Flowing Kitchen\". \"Oh! No one told you this was a free flowing kitchen??!!\", is what his response was when we mentioned that we had waited 40 minutes between meals. \"Yea, we serve dishes as they're ready.\" This same guy there also said to me as he was collecting our plates, \"See? Doesn't the food taste better when you have to wait for it??\"   I couldn't believe this guy. True blue Vegas bullshitter this guys was. I couldn't even look him in the eye after he asked that absurd question. Our actual waiter was nice and apologized for the wait and we tipped him in cash but I would warn anyone looking to try this place beware...you might just be there a lot longer than planned . I mean, it was unforgivable. We basically ordered three sandwiches and sides and then that guy with his \"free flowing kitchen\" talk. Gimme a friggin break.   Never going back.",

    "text": "This restaurant popped up on my yelp feed, I was so excited to try it! The pictures looked on point, reviews looked good and so we decided to drive out of our way to check it out.   The location is definitely not the safest, I wouldn't suggest going at night. Upon walking in there's a sleek and clean vibe with music playing a little too loud for regular conversation. We where sat immediately, which was nice.   There was no napkin or utensils set up at our table, after ordering the first dish arrived. Cauliflower wings with French fries, we had ordered sauce on the side.   We asked for utensils but none arrived for some time, the second dish was the salad with a honey vinaigrette...it was honey mustard. Not very good at all. We still have no utensils at this point we are starving, the food is cold and we have hit savage level... munching with our hands!  We asked for Fiji bottles water, they finally brought over a karaf of ice water... needless to say we where ready to leave and just asked to cancel the Fiji water.   The food just wasn't flavorful but most of all they haven't gotten the service aspect down yet. I hope with time this place becomes a vegan gem but as of today I would not go back.",

We went three times in one week during a recent vacation, and they ran out of several deserts and a few mail menu items even though a truck came with new food in the middle of the week. Still, we mostly enjoyed our food.   The menu is large, so there are many selection options. The salsa tastes like Pace out of a jar, and the cheese sauce (not really queso) tastes better with the meatless meat added.   By far, the desserts are the saving grace of the whole place! I'd go back even just for their dessert.",

I went with a non vegan group of black folks, so you know we were side-eyein the southern staples.   I got the Louisiana Fried Chicken with mash potatoes and gravy with a side of coleslaw.   The Fried \"chicken\" was absolutely amazing, the texture and fry batter was shockingly familiar. Mash potatoes... golden and buttery, the coleslaw was super salty and honestly my least favorite part of the meal.   My homie also got \"Fish\" Tacos, which she said were BOMB. It's crazy how many different types of cuisine they have coming outta one spot.   Rarely am I rushing to go places that sell Italian and Sushi at the same time. But you can't beat 100% plant based eating. That's what I like to call good eats.",

The following day, August 9th, I returned with friends for lunch. We arrived and there were about 8 open tables. We, as well as 3 other separate parties stood at the front door without being greeted. We all just kind of stood there waiting for some kind of acknowledgement the bartender and both servers would walk by and actively not have eye contact. I couldn't believe this was the same place I was the evening before. After about 10 min one of my friends went to ask the bartender if we were going to be greeted and we were told we would not be seated for about 40 min because the kitchen was backed up. If the kitchen can't handle a load then maybe the menu should be dialed back to a load that can be managed. The service staff literally let us stand there and not speak to or acknowledge us.  We left after 15 min of standing there with no real acknowledgement.   This is not how a guest should ever be be treated.  Had any of them just come up and greeted us and explained what was happening we could have either decided to wait it out or leave. What had happened was the staff let about 9 people stand packed in the doorway acting like we didn't exist.   Supper disappointing after my first visit was fine.",

I got the spaghetti and meatballs and it was DELICIOUS. The meatballs were just perfect! My mom got the chick'n and waffles and to my surprise she loved the combo. I did go with my father and brother who are particular closed off to meat substitutes and anything vegan. Because of this they found it hard to find something to eat, but they both ended up getting food that they tolerated. My advice- don't bring people who don't want to try meat substitutes or anything \"vegan\". My brother got the nachos and they were fantastic, and the taco meat was delicious. I WOULD recommend the bottomless mimosas, they bring them out to you at the perfect time! And the mermaid mimosa... AMAZING.  Basically I loved this place and if I could, I'd eat there every day. The servers are friendly and you get food fast!",

I ordered the lobster roll, it was unreal. The texture of the lobster was almost identical to the real thing, the magic sauce they use is the perfect compliment to the meat. The fries were fresh and tasty. The meatball sub was very good as well. Everyone in our party, vegan and none loved their food.

When we came through the door it took about 10 minutes for someone to notice and seat us. My bf ordered a beyond beef burger and I ordered the breakfast burrito. Our waiter was pretty great but we could tell that this place doesn't use team work.   There were times throughout our meal that we would need something white our waiter would be busy and the other waitress would walk pass with her head down, careful to not make eye contact with us so that she wouldn't have to help us. She was dressed  minimally so maybe she was only going to tend to the tables that were mostly men. Which is what she did. Anyway, our food was good but just wish we could of had more attentive service. Our waiter did the best he could. When you work in a place like this you have to have good team working skills or the place will fall apart.   I also had left overs, I had only eaten one half of my wrap. I asked for it to be re-wrapped before I left because it wasn't wrapped well to begin with. The waiter brought it back in a to-go box but it hadn't been re-wrapped at all. Just dumped in a to-go box.",

I went on a Monday and had the avocado bruschetta which was amazing, and the cauliflower rice. Both were full of flavor and way better then I was expecting. If you've never had raw food before it's a good place to try. It's one of the better places I've been. The food wasn't to \"earthy\" like I've had at other places.  I'd definitely go back and order both dishes again! The staff was very nice and I was surprised that my bill was under $20 for two items! I had to take some home the portions were so big!",

    "text": "I had just come off a 3 day binge of Cafe Gratitude in LA where I had eaten everyday and then my first night in Las Vegas I decided The Modern Vegan instead of my staple Vegenation.  Location was a $10 Uber ride from my hotel. Windows are all blacked out. As I opened the doors I questioned myself if I was entering a billiards hall. It was loud. Too loud. Many TVs all playing different channels. Bare decor. That's fine, it's about the food right?  I ordered the truffle mushroom soup, a glass of wine, and the corn dogs. I had seen the corn dogs on the yelp photos and decided I'd do that. Then I ordered the lobster roll- same reasoning. What other vegan places have a lobster roll? Let's try it!  First baddy- my waiter/bartender came back and told me there was no soup. Ok. Oh wait, none. That they ran out. Of all of them. And I'm a soup person. Ok I won't replace it.  Then my lobster roll comes out. Before my corn dogs I ordered first? Which were an appetizer? No condiments for the fries offered.  The roll was OK. Forgettable. I can do this better at home with some mayo jackfruit onions and some Maywah seafood slices from china town.  Then I asked if I had ordered the corn dogs. I did. Phew.  They came out. I was finally offered water. Right?!  The corn dogs were insane. Insanely bad. I peeled off the batter. It was thin and extremely greasy. This was not a cornbread corn dog. This was a battered dog. A \"baddered dog\" one might say. I felt like I got sick.  I like soup didn't get it, I also like dessert so I was willing to try. I ordered the trio of cheesecakes. Strawberry, chocolate and blueberry.  I LAUGHED. I texted my husband and laughed. This was not three different cheesecakes. This was the same cheesecake cut into three slices with different toppings. Different toppings like a small dollop of peanut butter. I didn't finish this either.  Now let me be honest- I absolutely support and love vegan places. I've been vegan for 17 years. But just making something to have options? No. It's 2018. Quality over quantity. And atmosphere man. This place had me looking around constantly being like...who decorated? Who signed off? WHO NAILED THE FAKE GRASS UNDERNEATH THE BAR?!   If you're vegan and want some out of the norm options I'm sure this place has perked your curiosity- but if you've been anywhere else in the world of vegan establishments this place falls short.   Sorry. But really, I should have gone somewhere else but I'm glad I checked it off my list.",

Came here on a Saturday with my mom & fiance for lunch with the excitement to finally try their famous chik'n & waffles and thankfully were seated right away despite how busy and filled up it was.  The menu is massive - heads up you'll take a good couple minutes trying to figure out what you want especially since everything sounded amazing! We decided to go for the chik'n & waffles, the vegan lobster roll, & a side of the baked mac n cheese.   After the server took our order, we basically didn't see her until the end of our meal. We had to ask more than one server/busser that passed by our table when we needed something and it would take almost 10 minutes for them to even come back.   The food was just okay, especially for the price. The only good thing about the chik'n & waffles was the waffles; the breading on the chicken was falling apart and everything was just too sweet. The vegan lobster roll was wayyy too sour and I had wish it was a little warm, I felt like I was just eating cole slaw and bread. The best thing we had was the Mac  n cheese & it was only a small side portion - definitely recommend getting the full-sized entree.   Overall, our first time experience was okay. Not sure if we'll be back but definitely a good place to try out if you're vibing some vegan comfort food next to UNLV.",

Got the Hawaiian salad...VERY basic for $15....also hit breakfast potato skins for app which came after main courses...asked for a side of ranch which tasted like tartar sauce told server and was told back they get complaints a lot due to which chef if making sauces or cooking such and such. I feel this palace could have a lot of potential but has to get there wide frame menu together with staff and Kitchen or just serve burgers and sandwiches.",

I did not immediately realize this so we didn't ask the grubhub delivery person about it. When I did realize, I called the number the restaurant has listed on yelp and on my order receipt. I called 4 times with no one ever answering the phone. The voicemail box also said it was full.   We visited the restaurant in person as well and they said the reason we didn't get our order was because they were out of the item we ordered. If you're out of something, then tell us and give us the chance to order something else instead of letting one of our friends go hungry. That was so rude. Why didn't someone contact us? In addition, they said they don't have a phone right now. What?! It rang each time and is listed on their page. They just choose not to answer it and that is different.  This business needs to communicate 1000% better with customers. Grubhub gave us a refund for the item but TMV was not very apologetic or interested in our business. The customary thing to do is offer a free item for our troubles. Our morning breakfast plans on our vacation were ruined because of their service. The least they could do is give us something for free.  BE WARNED: If you try to call this business they will not answer. I guess there's not enough vegan restaurants around for them to be competitive. They don't care about offering good service even though you're paying them $18 an entree.  We will not be back unless something drastically changes about their management style.",

I have read other reviews that state the food here is salty and I have to agree. They could cut back a little on the salt. That being said, the food is still yummy. Another favorite of mine is the lobster roll. I look forward to trying other meals here but if there's one suggestion I could make, it would be to cut back on the salt please. I am so happy that there is a vegan restaurant with so many options. Thank you for this vegan restaurant!  I have a new review for this restaurant. This is the first time I've ever experienced dining in this restaurant since I've always had take out. This time I brought my two girlfriends. The service was hardly desirable. Our meals came separately approximately 10 to 20 minutes apart from each other. The water tasted horrible and to even get a refill took forever. I was a little embarrassed that I recommended this place to my friends. I'm sure they will never come back. I will probably come back for takeout but like I said earlier the food that I have ordered here is very salty. But not unedible and it is still tasty in spite of the salt. I do hope they cut back on the salt, improve their service and water taste. I feel the water is not filtered by the way it tasted. Thank you modern vegan for trying! There could be improvements but not all is lost. You always have a chance to do better. Maybe I can convince my girlfriends to give it one more try.",

    "text": "If I have to sum up the restaurant in one sentence, it is a slightly overpriced place that serves delicious comfort-food style vegan dishes, and A LOT of them.   The menu is HUGE. However, if you dive into it, you'll find familiarity in each item, and it becomes less daunting. Imagine a PT's (or a Gold Sierra's) menu, and substitute the protein and cheese in those sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers with vegan meat and vegan cheese.   We ordered the Queso Dip, mac&cheese, the lobster roll and the buffalo chicken burger. It was amazing to think that none of these dishes were made from animal protein. The seasoning and creative usage of different types of veggies alone brought out layers of flavors. The reason for 1 less star was 1) the price. I know eating Vegan is a little more expensive, but everything can be about $2-$3 less on the menu, and will keep me on the hook to go back on a weekly basis; 2) the fine details. If I were to pay that price, I expected a little bit more refinement in each dish (talking about presentation, garnish, final touches, etc.)  Is this a place to eat super healthy (think Panacea) ? Probably not. But is this the place to satisfy your cravings and convince your meat-eating friends (or yourself) that vegan doesn't mean bland food? Absolutely!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place!! Unbelievable!! We were in Vegas for a couple of days, and ate only here for our breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had no desire to check out other vegan places, because TMV has everything we could possibly want, juices, sodas, burgers, fries, pasta, bowls, desserts, etc. etc. The prices are very reasonable, the menu is expansive, and the portions are enormous! I highly recommend the \"chicken\" and waffles, and spaghetti!! (holy crap!!). I'm telling you, this place would turn a meat eater vegan!! The only problem with TMV is that there aren't more of them!! Seriously, check it out when you're in Vegas,or make a special trip just to check it out. You'll be glad you did!!",

I wanted to see what the new tenants did to the place.   The parking lot was packed and so was the restaurant. I mean the place was hoppin!  The menu was large they had a huge selection. As I said I never had vegan food before but it was good.  If you are into the vegan diet thing I definatley recommend!",

During that 30 minutes that we were sitting there ordering/waiting for our food, this other customer was recording herself ask the waitress/bartender, Rachel, if there was soy product in pretty much every item on the menu. Not only was the woman being extremely disrespectful towards Rachel and the restaurant in general, but she waited until about 10:55 to place her final order, mind you the restaurant closes at 11. This womans \"job\" is to review restaurants, but she wasn't really reviewing it, more like bashing everything on the menu. We just wanted to say great job to Rachel for staying extremely professional and pleasantly friendly throughout that process. Secretly we all hope that lady never comes back to The Modern Vegan, but hopefully this woman and all 35 of her ig vlog followers give The Modern Vegan another chance ;)  Good job Rachel! You're a beast! Keep spreading peace and love to all, even the ones that don't return it   Sincerely,  Happy returning customers,  Stacey  and Cody",

It was so good on our way home back to LA we had to stop over and get sandwiches.  I got a Gyro and my husband got the Philly cheese steak and oh my god they were just delicious!  Also try the chicken and waffles if you are a vegetarian or a vegan you have never tried anything like this before ... it is pure heaven.

The menu is way too big for staff to manage and customers to wrap their minds around. The owner might need to take some restaurant management classes. It's a long wait to be seated and to be served our food. There is no hostess so customers walk in confused of how or if they sign in. An employee randomly comes by and just grabs who she has seen waiting the longest. I don't blame her as I see her juggle the whole restaurant that's being sabotaged by a menu way too big. P.S. I was told I couldn't replace my fries for carrots. Carrots are super cheap.",

When a place first opens it's always expected there's going to be some issues, but waiting 2 hours for food is absurd...so is being told they ran out food not once but 3 times.......and so is waiting 30 minutes to get the check. The food is good but not worth the wait or the price...I'll come back MAYBE when things are running a lot smoother.  One other thing...we ordered a burger after the 3 other things we wanted were gone, and waited 45 minutes for it, but by that time they were closing and instead of giving me the food that I wanted, they took it off the check without letting us know and sent us away.

Gina (owner) really knows who she is catering to, vegans who want savory comfort food. And for those who are skeptics, I came here with a meat eater, and he was truly impressed. We ordered the Louisiana fried chicken and the Reuben. We actually came back a second time because it was too good not to, we ordered burgers, I don't remember which ones, but it doesn't matter everything was delicious. Pluuus the service was amazing, we didn't wait long for our food. I really hope Gina opens a location in SoCal because TMV is the new standard.",

We ordered avocado toast starters and 2 entrees, my entree came out first, when I questioned about the starter we wanted to share, the response \" we are a free flow kitchen\"  my partners entree came with the starter about 5 to 8 minutes later when I was more than half finished.  So what do I do finish my entree and let the starter get cold, or finish my entree and let the starter get cold.  Does my partner eat the starter, and let his entree get cold?  these are not the choices I thought I would have to make.  Great tasting food, stupid service.",

The mashed potatoes were good but lacked salt. Fast forward to Saturday morning 9/29 (My Birthday) - we walked in with coffee and before we were greeted we were told outside food wasn't allowed - but we weren't told that the day before. Whatever take the coffee they were almost empty anyway. We order 3 different meals the BLAT, MAC & Cheese Balls & PB Delight. Everything was fantastic!!!!  We were given plates that were not larger then a slice of toast... When we asked for larger plates the waitress responds \"Let me see if we have any\" I'm sorry do you not normally have plates in a sit down to eat establishment? Anyway as we were brought back 2 plates we noticed they were dirty.. When asked for new clean plates we watched the waitress go over to the kitchen window to wipe them off - not wash them or get new plates... When asked for a new plate she takes it back to the window and we watch her and the owner & cook inspect the plate looking at the dried up old food and laugh & joke about it. Really???? This is how you treat your paying customers? Despite the good food; the lack of customer service received makes this a No for me in the future!!",

I bet their chicken sandwiches/burgers are amazing too, if made with that same fried chicken patty. My husband got the biscuits & gravy, which tasted pretty good but was not as filling as my dish.  The service was spectacular. My mom is the least spice tolerant person ever and they changed out her order of pad thai (which we confirmed was not spicy prior to ordering it, but it came with hot peppers) right away.   VeganFatKid was having brunch while we were there by the way, which goes to show how good it is :) Def will come back.",

    "text": "I went to the modern vegan with my daughter on Friday, March 16th at 1pm. When we got there we were greeted promptly and sat quickly.  Our waiters, Kim,  greeted us and asked for our drink order. There was no juicer and so no way to make any of the juices and for some reason no way to make the smoothies. So we got water and my daughter got a sprite. The sprite came in a can which I hate cause that means you pay per drink.  They should have a soda machine because the meal is already so pricey.  The water had a funny taste to it and we sent it back. I had Kim bring me another one but it still tasted funny. Also there was a huge list of foods they were our of. My daughter wanted the pulled pork sliders but they couldn't make them without the mayo and so she got the spaghetti and meatballs. It seemed a little small to me but the sauce tasted great and was had lots of veggies on it which I love. I ordered the v'eggs Benny which was wonderful. And the asparagus that came with it were great as were the mashed potatoes that my daughter ate half of. Alao we ordered the cauliflower wings with a medium aauce which came with fries.  Both were very tasty and i loved the breading on the cauliflower. Kim checked on us often and brought extra napkins,  salt and pepper. I ordered a 2nd sprite due to the water issue.  Then at the end alot of the desserts I wanted to try were also out. But my daughter was full so we left without. We paid $60 which is a hefty price for 2 people but we loved the food so we'll be back. I hope they get the water to taste better,  get in everything they ran out of and allow for more modifications I'm the future.  Overall though great job and we love you!!!",

    "text": "The menu is extensive which is awesome but food that I ordered was mostly just ok and wait was crazy. Between waiting for a seat and waiting for our food, we spent 2 hours there.    People who came in after us got their orders first, one table ordered two of the exact same items I did. One of those items we were told was sold out but the other table was able to grab the last two. Felt like there's probably an issue with communication and timing between the front of house and back of house staff.   I ordered the Louisiana fried chicken. The chicken was good and tasted pretty realistic although I had hoped for more chicken. The entree included a large serving of coleslaw but it was pretty light on the dressing. The mashed potatoes had a coconut flavor which I didn't care for; I'd suggest they switch to using more neutral plant milks and creams for such items. Gravy was ok. Mac and cheese side was again, ok. My mom ordered the Philly cheesesteak which was pretty good. Fries not bad and was a large serving, but slightly mushy.  I went opening weekend though so I expected slow service and some kinks to be worked out. I'll be happy to try again in a few weeks.  I was happy the owner's husband asked us how we enjoyed the meal. I hope they learn a lot from opening weekend and can get the kinks worked out soon. Overall just happy there's another vegan restaurant in Las Vegas!",

The real test for longetivity will be if it can get through the summer when UNLV isn't in session.",

    "text": "This was our second time at the restaurant and as a local Las Vegas vegan I am always excited about vegan restaurants.  My husband is non vegetarian and the first time asked for the pulled pork. They brought my food the first with such a big gap that I ate alone. My youngest daughter had the lobster roll, way too much sauce and dill.  My husband ordered again the pulled pork. The sandwich was completely cold. We told the waitress and she said that she was sorry and will remove it from the bill if he didn't want anything else. The manager came over and told us that she was sorry and that she'll take care of it.  They bring the bill and when I looked she removed only half of it. The vegan pulled pork sandwich (which is probably jack fruit) is $15!  I told the manager that she said that the sandwich will be removed from the bill and she said \"I didn't say that\". The waitress said that. \"But not me. I'll talk to her.\" Ok first off what type of manager throws her co-worker under the bus. A good leader/manager owns it and follows through and then if you need to communicate with your employees and give them more training then you do that. Never in front of the clients. When I told her that she will see the review then she said \"oh do you want me to remove it?\" No girl, you already showed your leadership style and the culture of the restaurant.  Too expensive for the service and the quality of the food.  Never again!",

But overall the atmosphere was rad! The food was AMAZING. I don't understand the negative reviews as far as the food. I had the chicken and waffles, and my boyfriend had the Mexicana. Vegenation doesn't compare... IVETTE WAS AMAZING. I BELIEVE THAT WAS HER NAME. GIVE HER A RAISE. SHE WAS PHENOMENAL. (Really skinny, short, long black hair)  Cons: the wait is REAL, if you're in a rush, don't go. Also, people seated after us (and in a larger group) got served first ? And we ordered breakfast... we showed up about an hour after opening. They were slow, so I don't think the wait was justified.  Also the employees are soooo uninformed. A lady behind us asked if she was safe to order anything because she was lactose intolerant... in my head I was like duh, BUT THE WAITER HESITATED. then proceeded to tell her to stay away from certain things on the menu? When they are 100% plant based....  Definitely at-least give this place a try! I will definitely go again and hopefully the recent reviews aren't True.",

    "text": "Honestly very disappointed In this establishment. The food looks so good in the pictures. But the experience of going there was a totally different experience. Initially we walk in and get seated right away. But the table we were seated at was dirty. So I asked if they could clean it. The person came back set down silverware then returned to clean the table. Already a bad start. Next our server comes over and brings us water and informs us a large portion of the menu items were 86'd. She leaves us with a list of about 20 items that are not available. So the menu is limited now and have to ask if other items that have similar things on those are available. Some yes some no. The waitress returns 10 minutes later doesn't ask if we would like anything to drink. Then proceeds to ask if we're ready to order. We order and I ask to substitute something out. She says that's fine no problem. Puts the order in and proceeds to comeback about 5 minutes later and tell me for the substitution I'd have to pay an up-charge of 4 dollars. I would understand if it was 1-2 dollars as being a side. But 4 is too much for a substitution especially after being told it was no problem when I ordered. Lack of communication between front of the house and the kitchen. I say it's fine I no longer want the substitution just remove the side I didn't want. I then attempt to drink my water but notice my cup is dirty. Another dirty item in the same dining experience ruined it even more for me. I look for my waitress to inform her of the cup but she's off talking to a coworker and ignoring her tables. I have to call the hostess over and show her my dirty cup she states eww yeah I can see that it's dirty and gets me a replacement. Our food comes at different times with only two entrees ordered. Bad time management. Especially that the other person that dined with me ordered her entree atleast 5 minutes before me because I wasn't completely sure what I was gonna order as to not order the same thing. Also when I got my food I received the substituted item and was shocked because I told her I didn't want it because of the up charge. I brought it to her attention because I wasn't going to be charged for something I stated I no longer wanted before receiving my food. She stated no you won't be charged for the up-charge and that the kitchen messed up because she even told them don't put the substitution. The saving grace of the experience was the food though. The food was delicious and flavorful. And that honestly saved the experience from getting an even worse rating. But the lay issue we encountered was after eating our food and having our table cleared. Our waitress had disappeared yet again for another ten minutes. As we sat  there waiting for our check so we could pay and go. She eventually showed up asked if we wanted dessert but we stated we were full. So we got our bill paid and left. The all around experience was barely ok. And honestly if I were to eat here again I'd order to go as to not deal with the rest of the venue.",

The staff is friendly and accommodating and the food is incredible! The  first time there were 4 of us and today we were a group of 3. We have tried: Chicken and waffles, Eggs Florentine, Reuben, Lobster Roll, Breakfast potato skins, Buffalo chicken sandwich and Meatball sub. They were all sensational!! I can't wait to go back and keep working my way through the entire menu!",

    "text": "I am glad this place exists! Nothing like finding a vegan restaurant; where the menu is catered around your choices, and not you attempting to piece together a decent vegan meal around appetizers and sides like most mainstream places. I will definitely go back, now the reason for a 3 star rating. First....how are you out of drinks, and or have to check if a menu item is available for purchase? I have to say, I have NEVER been to a restaurant that essentially cannot provide what is listed on the menu. I have eaten at many places, and as costs of meal goes up, I have an expectation that service goes up....not for service to go down. Strange! Another thing was service. Was slow, had to ask for things, like napkins, syrup, and spoons for the ice cream.....why do I have to ask for spoons....for ice cream??? It's also VERY loud...music is blasting....I am assuming because they are located under the flight path of McCarran Airport....I suggest bringing pen/paper,using sign language, or stop by Lakeshore Learning and buy one of those learning sets that elementary school kids use....it's like a phone system and 8 kids and a teacher \"plug in\" the sets;it sits in the middle of the table, and you can hear one another speak through the \"phone piece\".....yeah....get one of those....because communication even with the staff was an exchange of loud almost yelling interaction :) Still thou.....food was pretty darn good.",

Nice smaller size, too.   Service: I felt like the service was just a smidge slower than what I'm used to, but our waiter was super friendly and chill, and joked around with us a lot, and helped with recommendations.   Food: I want more! Not planning another trip to Vegas but man I really want to try more of this menu. Breakfast is available all day and they have a humongous menu, there were so many things I wanted to try! Definitely will be checking out their menu for home cooking inspiration.",

Eating with your eyes is very, very important but enjoying what you're eating is just as important.  We will be back and hopefully the chef will notice my advice.",

First off, our food came way too fast upon ordering and was not hot?? So we can assume the food is not freshly prepared and quickly heated in a microwave. Heard the table next to us send their food back. We thought about it, but what was the point. We both picked at our huge plates and only ate the potatoes. The menu is way too big. Too much selection can be overwhelming. Perhaps they could scale back the menu to 1/3 of what it currently is and focus on making those few dishes fresh and tasty. So embarrassed that I took my friend here. Plus it's located in a sketchy area with people dealing who knows what outside. The cherry on top is my friend texts me later saying she feels dizzy and asks if vegan food can do that to you! If there was any chance of converting a meat eater, this missed the mark. What an awful experience. Don't take friends and family here who are visiting from out of town. They will look at you like you're out of your mind. Servers are nice though.",

The first time we visited they only brought out half the table's food, then we had to wait 20 minutes to get the rest of our food. That time they compensated us for our troubles with some complimentary dessert.  Two visits we went for dinner. My husband got his sandwich before me and I, again, had to wait at least 15 minutes before my food came out. My husband FINISHED his gyro before I started eating. No mention of this or any apology from the servers.  Tonight we ordered takeout. First, they didn't tell us there was a veteran's discount and we have two veterans with us. Then They didn't get one of our orders so we had to wait another 30 minutes for them to make it. They claimed they put it to the front of the cooks orders, but it was a buffalo sandwich. They wouldn't give us that sandwich complimentary, either, and made us pay a second time for the meal.  I really love the food at this place, but if the service doesn't improve, they will lose patrons. Our patience was wearing pretty thin tonight.",

    "text": "VERY DISAPPOINTING. Ordered chicken and waffles. Asked for water. Got a cup of water--no ice. I'd just assume ice would be in the water, but I guess the waitress took me literally.First chicken and waffle was cold. Second one was cold. My daughter ordered ramen-out of ramen. She then ordered fries and lobster sandwich. Fries were cold. I'm assuming the sandwich is served cold, because it was cold too. Asked for a second cup of coffee and creamer. Waitress brought creamer but no coffee. Waited. Had to ask again for coffee. The bill? The wife's husband told us he'd take the chicken and waffles off the bill. Too loud when he was talking and didn't hear what he was going to do with the final bill. Got the bill, gave the waitress my daughters credit card. When she came back, she was charged for the chicken and waffle. Waited until we got husbands attention, then explained we were overcharged. Waited again for waitress to bring corrected bill. Waited extra long for to go boxes.  The whole experience was bad. The chicken and waffle looked so good. My mouth watered. One bite of cold mashed potato did nothing but kill my appetite x 2. With the whole rotten experience, I'd think her husband would've offered more of a discount. I feel he needs more restaurant/customer experience because he has no idea how to speak to the customer. We may give it a second try but it'll be in 6 months or so when they have things going good. If they're still open. LOOK at how delicious that would've been--had it been served hot.",

    "text": "I might give a higher rating once I actually get to eat here.   I've been watching this place on social media for weeks and was so excited for it to finally open. I honestly didn't have high expectations for opening day as I know it takes time to work out kinks and get the flow down - but I went anyway because I wanted to be supportive of a new vegan restaurant. Unfortunately, the experience was even worse than my low expectations.   The place was busy but not overwhelmed, we only waited 10 minutes or so to be seated for lunch. We were given our drinks and our server took our order...and then nothing for an HOUR! Our server literally would not make eye contact with us and ignored us the entire time. We finally flagged her down and asked about our food. She said that food was coming out slow and the table ahead of us had been waiting 2 hours for their food! Seriously?? 2 hours??? She said she was going to go ask about our food and then never came back. This server was terrible. No communication, no apologies, no customer service. Just flat out ignored us. We were starving at this point so after waiting another 15 minutes and no news we decided to just get up and leave.   There were some positives that stood out:   - The hostess was very pleasant & friendly.   - The interior is super cute.   - I love the modern vibe (not the traditional \"granola\" vegan spot).   - The menu is large and diverse.  - The food that we did see go by to other tables all looked amazing.    I'm disappointed I didn't get to eat here today but I will definitely come back in a few months and give it another try.",

    "text": "My first visit was back when they recently opened, small menu great flavor and the owner going out of her way to assist in anyway necessary. Fast forward to the present. The complete opposite,  Huge Hype menu which makes hospital cafeteria food taste like 5 star dining. Most seasonings are vegan rt? So shake a few in those dishes so they no longer taste like a microwave TV dinner. Service was the absolute worst. It was 15 minutes before we were seated although they weren't busy at all. Four servers standing at the bar glancing up trying not to make eye contact with us. Only seated after I asked. Had to ask for water and never received a refill. I didn't want to post a review because I understand everyone and every business has a bad day. So my wife messaged the owner on IG and no response. So if that's how much she values her customers I figure I'd let the public know. It seems she let the success get to her head and falls far short of what initially won me over as a customer. I truly hope you can do some damage control and get back to the way this restaurant was. Or maybe it's a reflection of how you treat your employees? Whatever the reason is, you lost control of this place and it shows. The two things this establishment offers are service and food and on my visit the modern vegan can not execute either. Do not support a business that takes success for granted",

The food, although, yes, mostly Gardein products, is delicious.  Because my digestive system is sensitive to soy products like Gardein I opted for the \"lobster\" roll which I believe was either artichoke or hearts of Palm. Either way it was amazing. And if you tend to skip over the dessert menu, DON'T!!  Their deep fried PB&J is one of the best things I have ever eaten. Picture a Monte Cristo minus the animal cruelty. I don't know how they made the batter but WOW!  Next time I might brave the Chickn and Waffles because it looks amazing, just didn't need the digestive issues this trip. Thanks Modern Vegan!  You rock Girl!",

It was understandably busy for a Saturday at 1 PM. Taking that into consideration, they still managed to take an unusual amount of time just to get our drink and food orders. We waited about 30 minutes to receive our drinks, and the waiter who brought them wasn't able to get our order right on the first try. My brother had to chase down his drink, or else I believe it would have never arrived! Our main waiter wasn't attentive to us in anyway, he even tried to give us the check before we recieved any food! Unfortunately, we had to leave, because after patiently waiting an hour and a half, we had run out of time. We  were not impolite or rude, and never received any food, nor an apology. I was expecting an apologize, at the very least! Any other time, in similar situations, it's always been acknowledged and/or accommodated in some way by the staff. I would never recommend this restuarant to anyone.",

I ate his gravy with my mashed potatoes and could've drank the bowl!!) and coleslaw. My chicken and waffles were amazing! The mac and cheese was missing something. We couldn't quite put our finger on it though. Nevertheless, the servers were super courteous and helpful, the ambiance was very cool and modern, and the TVs with the game on were just up my boyfriend's alley. We can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. Everything looked great!",

    "text": "Wow - just wow! We ate here three times during our stay in Vegas. We didn't plan on it, but it just worked out that way.   Right after we landed, we took a cab here. She was a bit crazy (if you watch Kimmy Schmidt Unbreakable - she was just like the old lady in the show). It was very interesting. Anyways, we went in luggage and all.   Inside its a bit modern/hip. Doesn't feel like super comfortable - more like a bit nicer environment, but it's whatever. We didn't feel out of place with our travel clothes. It's not classy per say, but it's all white and chic inside. It's funny that the couple at the other table from us ordered the exact same order as us. And then they were having issues getting an Uber back to the strip. I'll put this tip at the bottom too.   We started with the jalapeno bites. I liked them but didn't love them. It wasn't a cream cheese filling. More like melty cheddar filling. We also go the popcorn chicken. SUPER DELISH! I got the Chicken and Waffles with mashed potatoes, and the hubby got Shrimp Po Boy. CNW was AMAZING! Wow. The shrimp sandwich was ok. I never had the real version - so I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste, but I didn't like it that much.   Our second visit - I got the Philly Cheesesteak and I can't remember what the hubby got...was it Chicken and Waffles with mashed potatoes again?! I'm not sure. Whatever I had it was delish! We also got the deep fried banana split. It was a bit much. LOL but very interesting to try. Ice cream was super good!  Our third visit no photos. I got a burger and I can't recall what the husband ordered. I believe it was a Beyond Beef burger. Typical. If I could do this third stop over, I probably would have ordered something else.   Overall, the food was really good. I would definitely go again and recommend to vegan and non vegans. So many more things I would have liked to try! Until next time!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place out since they opened. I attempted one time to go and order some dinner to take home but they don't let you order to go which means I would really never get to come here often because they're closed Tuesday and they close at 6pm on operating days.  So I was able to pick anywhere I wanted to for Mother's Day and TMV was the first thing that came to mind! I was so looking forward to trying it and my daughter and I got dressed up and to go eat.  When you walk in the place is nice and clean the hostess was nice sat us down and our server came over to take our order. I always order my daughters food first even if I'm not ready to order and all she wanted was a order of fries with cheese. The server said (the cheese is vegan) is that ok?! What!!? This is a vegan restaurant so would hope the cheese was vegan. So she puts in her order then we put in 2 more orders and while we waited we got served the smallest cups of warm water.  So our first order comes out, not my daughters order so we don't eat until all of us have our food. We told someone we were waiting for my daughters fries with cheese and they still came out with our other order plus appetizer and not my daughters food. So we told them once again our daughter doesn't have her food so we're waiting to eat.  Then a server finally brings out her order and says it's way too hot and sorry they didn't know it was for a child! Even after making it very clear and my daughter is the one that asked for it. By this time I was not happy with the service I could understand if it was super busy but that was not the case.  The food was alright not what I thought it would be my coleslaw had no flavor and my other food was already cold from waiting so long.  So I asked for my food to go.  One more thing I want to add is 11$ for 3 jalapeno poppers to me is a little much! I never complain about prices especially if the food is good in this case it wasn't worth the price.  I was really disappointed all around and don't think I'll go back which is a bummer because I love to support our local vegan businesses.  This was just a no for me.",

I can't speak to the restaurant atmosphere since we had our food delivered, but it arrived quickly on a Friday morning. We have had vegan comfort food other places, but this was too notch flavor. And the combination of the flavors, such as the chickn with the waffle with the mashed potatoes was so complimentary I can't rave enough about how yummy it was! The 'steak' was also incredible. It is difficult to get a faux meat to come out so close to real meat, as well as to get the different 'meat flavors' to come out tasting uniquely from one another, but this place is master at it. Whether you're a vegan or not, the food from this place is a must to try!",

Menu- large selection, too many items on the menu, crowded and hard to read with the small font.   Had the $14 Baked Mac & Cheese, it was pretty good. Ordered the $10 Key Lime cheesecake to go. I was shocked at the size! For $10 at least provide a normal slice. Here's a photo with a bottle cap next to it to show scale. It's half a slice. C'mon! That\"s four bites max! Not worth it. Worst yet, was the rude manager, when she asked me how everything was, I told her the desert was overpriced. Her response was arrogant and dismissive. For a local off strip joint in the fruit loop district,  Robuchon you're not! Your prices and unfriendliness don't justify the 3rd rate strip mall experience.",

I really enjoyed the vibe, definitely modern with a hint of fancy-ness although still casual. I also appreciated how friendly the staff was. They were on top of taking orders and being very efficient, as well as kind. So all the stars for that!  My husband's choice was the coconut curry (good call!) This was delicious and definitely my fave of the three we ordered. I think it would go great with rice! The lobster roll was okay, I'm not sure I even liked lobster roll when I used to eat seafood, so honestly I don't know why I ordered it haha. I think I was surprised it was cold, but that's how a real lobster roll is served, so totally not their fault, mine for lack of research. The Mac and cheese was on point with creaminess, but not super cheesy that I'm used to tasting, but not bad.   I honestly wish I could have ordered more to sample, but our time in the area was limited and I only have so much I can fit in my stomach. All the menu items looked incredible and I'm sure very delicious. That's another plus, lots to choose from, so whatever mood they seem to meet that need. One thing is for sure, we'll be back again when in the area!  Overall the experience was great!",

The energetic pace of my server seemed slightly rushed and inattentive. It felt as if she was rushing me just to see if I would order more than an appetizer. I The corn dogs on the appetizer menu should be provided with a garnish for the $11 price point. Presentation should strongly be a factor when asking your patrons to invest in this portion of a meal, especially if you are modern in Las Vegas. Nonetheless, I had to ask another server to order another item due to the server for my table being more absent than she was towards the beginning of this visit. I have been to vegan restaurants nationwide, and this was my least favorite of them all. Hopefully, this franchise will focus on a wholistic experience other than the menu being 100% plant-based.",

It is white and it was immaculate. The menu was so extensive that I was overwhelmed with what to try. Normally, I'd try more than one dish in that situation, but the  prices were so high I couldn't afford to. I didn't knock the prices, though, because we were in Vegas, right? *shrug* Instead of being overwhelmed, I went with the daily special, which was a vegan version of a Big Mac (close to $25). That thing was huge!!! Like, so big I couldn't bite it without squeezing it hard. I tapped out before finishing it with the delicious crispy fries that came with it. The service was great. The guy who helped us was patient and kept checking on us.  I can't wait to get back to Vegas so I can try another item on the menu.",

I ordered the buffalo cauliflower wings as an appetizer and for my main course i had the lobster roll with a side of french fries. It was so delicious, and flavorful with that creamy avocado sauce drizzled on top-delightful. My sister ordered the Mack Attack sandwich and she gave it a two thumbs up and said the taste was similar to the 'Big Mac' except guilt free! There's nothing like eating guilty yet guilt free. The moment we got to the restaurant and looked at the menu, we knew that during our Vegas stay we'd be coming back again. The restaurant is right next to UNLV in the same plaza as the 7/11 and there's parking!!!! I can't wait until this restaurant comes to Atlanta because I'll be there every single day. See you soon TMV   So I came back to TMV The next day along with someone who is non-vegan and she was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Mac n cheese baseballs, the chick'n and waffles and I ordered the \"jerk chicken\" sandwich as my main course. The cauli wings were still tasty and we got the bbq flavor this time. The Mac n cheese baseballs were also very tasty and had great texture with the crispy, crunchy exterior and the macaroni was cooked to perfection.",

We should have known better than to stay because all the tables were full and the couple before us had been waiting for a long time. The wait was insane.  The poor pregnant hostess was running around seating people while taking orders, serving food, and bussing tables. I wanted to sit her down and let her know that she needs to train her staff better so everything runs smoothly, especially when she is on baby leave.   Get ready to view the largest vegan menu I've ever seen. The portions are enormous! Bring your appetite. I loved the chicken and waffles on top of mashed potatoes. The pulled pork sandwich wasn't that great but I'm sure they'll improve their recipes as time goes on.    I'll give them a thumbs up for lasting a year and opening a new location in San Diego. However, the kitchen needs to get synchronized on executing orders at the same time for a table. My dish didn't come out until 10 minutes after my love received his.",

The deep fried sandwich was on the dry side, but I asked for a scoop of ice cream, which made it perfect!

    "text": "I was in town for NBA Summer League and woke up needing fuel for the day. John A., legendary Commissioner of my fantasy basketball league, suggested meeting at the Modern Vegan, and I was more than a little suspicious. My last memory of vegan food was at Pure Food and Wine, eating \"vegan cheese\" that tasted like cardboard. Bad vibes from PFW were right, too: the place shut down in a blaze of infamy due to cashflow issues and inability to pay workers, completely unpardonable. It made me enter Modern Vegan with low expectations.  Those expectations were quickly reversed. Vegan corn dogs were incredible. I hate to be cliche, but \"I couldn't even tell they were vegan!!!!\" and even better, didn't have a flashback of Ralph Nader saying he would never eat a hot dog because he knew what went into it. Falafel was OK as well, though not as exceptional. Hard to fault MV for that, though, given the low upside for falafel.   MV is located in a strip mall and windows are all blacked out. I wondered for a moment if the place had shut down and become some seedy stereotypical \"Vegas\" establishment, but it's just decor. Inside is totally normal and clean. This place gets the #MERLINFIVE.",

Neither one of us is vegan but we were looking forward trying something new and we were soooooo happy we did. We started with mimosas, oh so bubbly and refreshing, and smoothies for the kids, so tasty I'll have hard time convincing them to drink my homemade ones. We then ordered some appetizers to share: the literally loaded nachos-truly the best nachos I've had, an abundant portion for everyone to indulge. The Mac and cheese baseballs-cheesy, warm and delicious. The perfect corn dogs- if I didn't know they were vegan I'd never be able to tell the difference as they far exceeded our expectations on what a vegan corn dog should taste like! We then ordered the stuffed portobello steak, my absolute favorite, so flavorful and healthy I wanted to take another one home. The spicy chicken wrap was superb and asked for another round of drinks. The philly cheese sandwich which beat the flavor of most regular phillys we've had before. We could leave without ordering the Cody waffle and it was the cherry on the cake. Besides the generous portions we cleaned all our player and savored every bite. Thank you TMV and we can't wait to see you again!",

They have a long family style table too, if you have a big group.   The servers were very friendly and fun. They only have one soup a day (although there are about 8 on the menu, they switch off) We were lucky it was creamy truffle soup, and it was soooooo delicious!   We got the \"eggs\" benny and the chicken and waffles. The portions seemed very very large, but it was mostly a giant serving of mashed potatoes underneath everything. I don't know if they serve all the dishes like this, but both main courses we got were like this. It was nice for presentation, and I'll never complain about a big portion, but the problem for us wax that they placed everything on top of them. So almost every bite tasted more like potato than the actual food. If I go back I would ask for that on the side instead of underneath.   The chicken and waffles were AMAZING! But they didn't quite pull off the eggs Benny. The \"hollandaise sauce\" didn't remotely taste like hollandaise sauce. Which I was really looking forward to.  We also got the jalapeno poppers. They were little bites of fried heaven, and those I would definitely get again!",

OMG we got deep fried banana bread and it was sooo delicious. Portions so big we went back to our hotel with 3 to go boxes lol.  Next day on a branch time we sheared soup and breakfast burritos between 3 people and the same desert for the whole table ( there was 8 of us)  If u visiting LasVegas even if u staying on the strip take a small trip to this wonderful place, u won't be disappointed!",

I ended up coming here twice during my Las Vegas Trip and both times our waitress forgot us and forgot things we ordered and we had to go up to the bar and asked for our bill so we could leave.   But the food WAS AMAZING. I would still recommend people come here because the food is so good. First visited we ordered the mac and cheese baseballs, breakfast tacos and waffles. Everything was amazing and my husband who is not a vegan agreed, the food was great.   Second time I ordered the bacon stuffed peppers and fried chicken and mashed potatoes and you get so much food! So yes the food is pricy but the taste and the amount you get is worth it.   So would I come here again? Yes.  Do I recommend it? Yes just don't expect great service.",

This place is not what it looks like on the outside. It's part of a little strip mall but when you go in it's super cute and trendy. The wait staff were all nice and everything moved quickly, I was surprised how fast the food came out! The menu is EXTENSIVE, I had a tough time choosing. They have breakfast (all day), salads, burgers, sandwiches, and lots of great drinks (smoothies and alcoholic drinks). My pulled pork sandwich with slaw was amazing, and the TMV sauce was great with the fries. I'll definitely be coming back before I leave.",

    "text": "Having loved our first dining experience here, we returned for a follow up and sadly tonight's choices weren't as stellar as those from our first night.  My hubs ordered the mac and cheese and the flavor just wasn't there for us.  We have tried our fair share of vegan macs, both restaurant quality and store bought, so we know a more cheesy flavor is possible.  Beyond that, it also felt like the overall seasoning could've been stronger.  It's a rather large serving of just straight mac and cheese ..if it had been the side to something else maybe we could have seen past it.  Wanting something \"healthier\" and chock full of veggies, I went for the breakfast budha bowl.  The flavor was on point and it was sooo tasty but man it was swimming in oil.  That just defeats the purpose of choosing a heathier option.  We're considering a third/final visit tomorrow since it's a reasonable distance and can be fit into our packed schedule tomorrow.  Hoping the third time will reinstate our original feelings if we do make it in again.",

The music is fun, but not too loud.   The servers were friendly, knowledgable and attentive! I love their all black uniforms.  The bathrooms are clean and stocked... and gender neutral!  The customer service was on point! We were seated right away and received our food and drinks in a timely manner!  We ordered the poutine for an appetizer. It was bomb! Cheesy, rich, and the fries never lost their texture. I ordered the chicken and waffles for my entre. It was really yummy! I would recommend more chicken, but it was still so good! My boyfriend ordered a burger with bbq and bacon it it! It was also very tasty. I always love Beyond Burger patties. My friends ordered the lobster roll and Reuben hot dog. The Reuben was very good- rich and kinda spicy. I didnt try the lobster roll but it looked great! Lol  We are so happy with our experience! I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "The Modern Vegan is a gem hidden in an unassuming strip mall in the shadow of UNLV.  My kids call me a flexitarian as I can be a hard core Vegan, Vegetarian or an Omnivore!  I like to say that I follow my body's religion when it comes to food, I feed on what fuel it needs or craves, within reason!  I can't believe I've never eaten here before now!  Trust me, it was so wonderful, I'll be back!! We all ordered something different and shared, family style,  that's how we roll(sometimes)... The Chicken n Waffles with Bacon and Mashed potatoes are GREAT if that's your jam (not mine), the Lobster Stuffed Portabello with asparagus and cauliflower were TDF! We also ordered the Bolognese with Zoodles which was delicious, it tasted clean and flavorful, the Pad Thai was good however,  the noodles were a little overcooked (says my friends' mom who orders that on the regular), the kids enjoyed the Spaghetti and Meatballs but the Mac n Cheese was bland,  if you regularly eat nutritional yeast on foods you'll be ok, it had \"that type\" of flavor.  The service was good, I think that it was a busy GRADUATION weekend and they were slammed and you got that sense that they were frazzled. I appreciate when staff let's you know what's going on, that way, we as customers understand and can be more patient, tolerant, compassionate and flexible. Maybe better staffing for busy days. It's a tough line of work and I appreciate these folks serving me so I can kick back, relax, eat yummy food  and enjoy my family and friends!",

I was very disappointed because not only did it cost me $18 just for this burger, but it's something that would usually cost me $8 at Pancho's Vegan Restaurant.  Now the second thing is they made me re-order twice because they had run out of what I was trying to get. I finally picked the popcorn chik'n which cost me $14. It really isn't anything special. Next time I'm just going to walmart and buying a bag of Quorn instead.  So disappointed at the price and the service.",

I lived in LA at the time so recently moved to LV and was dying to go here with my bday around the corner decided this would be the perfect place to celebrate. WRONG- walked in with my family of 4 stood at the entrance for 10 min before they came to greet us to be seated, mind you there was 5 employees running around and walked by us a few times and not one said we'll be right with you nothing. And over 6 tables empty. So we get seated by a gentleman that stated your waitress will be right with you, another 10 min later the waitress comes to the table we were ready to order. My 8 yr old just wanted 1 corn dog and fries which she couldn't do so I had to order 4 corn dogs cause the owner wasn't there? Anyways She didn't bring our food out another waitress and a gentleman brought our food out. After 5 min I had to ask the other waitress for my missing items drinks, side sauces etc. cause my waitress was no where to be seen, then after I seen her I waved her down to Inform her that we couldn't eat the nachos they put so much cheese that my chips are all soggy and it was just to much grossed us out you couldn't taste anything else.  I got the Fried chicken and mashed potatoes are super yummy maybe they should pair it with another side The coleslaw needs some flavor I love coleslaw I had 1 spoon of it and didn't touch it after that, needs some pepper some apple cider vinegar brown sugar simple ingredients for coleslaw.  I messaged the owner on IG just to let her know about the service we experience without her there the staff was not on there A game at all when I left I even seen one of the employees on the side on break drinking a tall can of beer. Very unprofessional and this owner should look into having someone run her business better while she's away. And they use plastic bags your vegan invest in eco. Friendly bags.",

Together we all got the Cauliflower Wings (family's favorite), Veggs Benny, Chicken and Waffles (family's second favorite), Steak and Veggs, and the Jerk. The breakfast portions are INCREDIBLY large!!! The other menu options were more reasonably sized. Overall, great food and quick service :)",

The menu is large but too large. It makes you want to try everything. I was really excited to try the holy hell after the amazing cowboy burger but it was out of stock. The poor waitress explained that the kitchen is kind of all over the place and half the time they don't know what's out of stock till someone orders it since it's so huge. I definitely would come back to this place. I just hope this new business works out all the kinks until then.",

Then like 20 minutes after leaving, both me and my friend (she ordered the nerd) got horrible stomach cramps & proceeded to have the worst upset stomach that lasted until the next morning.",

    "text": "I have... mixed emotions about this place. First of all, I didn't see the restaurant at first and it's on a one way street, so that was a fun start to the experience (sarcasm).   The location.... leaves a lot to be desired. I could barely find a parking space and the parking lot way fairly dark. The interior of the restaurant is very IKEA/Hipster-esque and I wouldn't say it's bad, but I wouldn't say it was exactly my cup of tea either. Everything feels a bit cramped and the lighting kind of reminded me of a hospital. My biggest note about the ambiance of the whole restaurant is that HOLY S/&@ the music is LOUD. I almost feel sorry for people who choose to go here for dinner with their friends/family/whoever because you'd be lucky to hear half of the things they say to you. I think my ears were ringing when we exited the restaurant after.  That being said, the menu is huge (which I'm not a big fan of, but it has its pros and cons) and the options are mostly really appealing. I would not usually spend as much on dinner as I did here, but we came for a special occasion, so I could justify it. The food tasted very junk food-ie. I didn't really like the burger I chose, but it tasted good and over all it wasnt bad, it just wasn't my thing. Boyfriend enjoyed his meal thoroughly and also liked our appetizer.   In conclusion, everything was -good- but it just wasn't exactly up my alley for the reasons above. Everyone was really nice and I can see why TMV is getting rave reviews.",

    "text": "So the executive assistants decided to go on a lunch date while the directors were stuck in training for the day.  Only one of us is actually vegan, but we've all for the most part experienced it and either don't mind it, or enjoy it.  Anyway, I got the lobster roll with fries and the pasta salad.  The food came quickly, so I was surprised that my fries were cold and slightly soggy.  The lobster roll wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  It had a lot of sauce on it.  I honestly don't know what they use for pseudo-lobster, but it felt like potato..I think maybe hearts of palm?  Aside from the sauce, kind of felt like I was just eating more fries.  I was surprised at how heavy it all was.  None of us were able to finish our meals, but I took my roll to go and I do intend to finish...honestly it wasn't terrible, maybe it just wasn't for me.  The only thing I was upset about was the pasta salad.  I didn't get pasta salad.  I got mac salad.  If it said \"mac salad\" on the menu, I wouldn't have ordered it.  That might seem really trivial, but coming from Hawaii, mac salad is kind of a big deal and it actually helps me separate good mainland Hawaiian restaurants from the bad ones.  When ordering it, I guess I expected something more like an anti-pasta...with olive oil or vinegar or something...just not vegan mayo.    I see a lot of reviews complaining about service.  We were sat right away.  Food came fast.  Server checked on us a few times, answered questions about the menu we had.  She was friendly and not intrusive.  I didn't have any issues at all, in fact I think the manager came to check on us too.  Whoever she was, she was making rounds checking on tables.  Overall not the worst experience, just nothing really stood out; at least not  in a positive way.",

    "text": "WOW. JUST WOW! I wish I could give more than 5 stars for this one. This is not simply good vegan cuisine.  THIS IS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS FOOD. PERIOD.  If you're reading reviews and trying to decide if you should dine here- I'll be the one to say it. The answer is YES. You NEED to experience the culinary genius that is The Modern Vegan. Mark my words this spot will become a popular and well known vegas destination before you know it!   Herbivore and carnivores unite because everything we ordered was beyond delicious.   Where do I even begin? My cousin and I decided to pop in after a day at the pool. We were greeted with a warm and friendly ambiance along with open arms. The restaurant is so chic and fabulous. Honestly it's every insta foodies dream.  The manager was so kind to take the time to seat us and fill us in on the interesting backstory of the incredibly talented  woman who is behind this fun and vibey joint.   After being seated, were promptly greeted by our server who was more than willing to give suggestions. (Which we appreciated) The menu was unlike anything I've ever seen. It's ENORMOUS actually. The options are endless. Which as a non meat eater, I felt as though I had just hit some sort of jack pot!   We decided to order the club with vegan bacon and the buffalo chicken sandwich and split both down the middle so that we can share.   THE FOOD. No words that I type on this review will even come close to expressing how unbelievably delicious BOTH sandwiches are. The buffalo chicken sandwich was SPOT ON. The texture, the flavor, and even the appearance. With our first bite we both let out an unintentional food moan as our eyes grew as big as saucers. My world was officially shook. Everything about this buffalo chicken sandwich was pure perfection. The selfish foodie in me was honestly a bit bummed I had to share in that moment....  but now after experiencing it I want to share this place with everyone!   The club sandwich was equally as life changing. It was monstrous in size and so so so tasty. I couldn't get over the bacon. It tasted just like a traditional club sandwich. This club had cucumbers- which happened to be one of our favorite things about this club. It gave the most delicious crunch with each bite.   We ordered both sandwiches with french fries. (Good decision on our part because the fries are super yum)   I honestly don't think there was a single morsel of food left on our plates. Throughout the entire duration of our dining experience we could not stop talking about how phenomenal the food was. Even hours after we ate, we were still talking about the pure creativity and deliciousness of what we experienced. Later that night we were TEXTING each other about. My mouth is no joke watering thinking about our meal just while typing this review. THATS HOW AMAZING THIS FOOD IS.   The Modern Vegan is a new favorite- and I am already planning a trip back-  not even a full day after dining there for the first time!   Thank you TMV for creating a fun and groundbreaking dining experience for those of us who do and dont eat animal meat!",

    "text": "Wow! I'm surprised at some of the complaints about this place! I get that there are off nights at places, but some people must be super hard to please! I came here with my sister tonight after hearing how much some of her coworkers love TMV. The location, in my opinion, is cool. It's close enough for tourists, but it's also tucked away on a small street across from The Double Down (easy enough for locals). The restaurant itself is in an unassuming building, and while one review critiqued it as feeling \"IKEA/hipster,\" to me, it just felt modern and clean. My sister, who is not vegan, pointed out how beautifully diverse the clientele was. It's definitely not just the downtown/hipster crowd.   The waitress we had was great! (Unfortunately, I didn't get her name.) Very professional and friendly-- she took time to talk with guests, but she was quick and efficient. They were out of the corn dogs, which my sister was bummed about as she heard they're awesome, but they have so many other options, that you really can't complain. I guess that's one thing that always gets me about reviews-- sometime people throw full blown temper tantrums over restaurants running out of popular items. Unless the restaurant is consistently out of like everything, you really gotta reevaluate your life if the one time it happens to you, you throw a hissy fit. Like, you're in Vegas ordering a moderately-prices delicious vegan meal, is your life really all that awful because you can't have one thing on a 100+ item menu? \\_()_/   As for the food, my sister and I split an order of popcorn chicken and the All American Burger (I think that's what it was called!). It was all delicious! The sriracha mayo sauce that came with the popcorn chicken was really delicious, and the burger was perfect! I'm pretty sure the patty was a Beyond Burger patty-- that was what it tasted like anyway, but the toppings all really came together nicely. The portions are big, so sharing with friends is totally a good plan. It's nice to try a little of everything. Unfortunately we were way too full to try any of the deserts, but we will definitely be back for one in the near future! Awesome find!",

    "text": "The Modern Vegan is one of the best things to happen to the Las Vegas vegan community recently. I was smitten with TMV after I first perused its expansive menu. In the ~5 times I've been here, I've barely even made a dent in checking off menu items off my list. Thus far, I've been happy with 95% of the food I've tried.   CORN DOGS ($11): This appetizer is a meal in itself since it comes with 4 giant corn dogs. Greasy perfection. 5/5 MAC & CHEESE SIDE ($5): Better than most vegan mac & cheeses I've tried, but not sure if it's omni approved. 3.5/5 GYRO ($14): The sauce and gyro plant-meat are amazing! But the pita bread is awful thick. 4/5 LOUISIANA FRIED CHICKEN ($15): My absolute favorite thing to eat here. My husband's too. The mashed potatoes and mushroom gravy are to die for. 5/5 V'EGGS BENNY ($15): Not my cup of tea. Not bad, but not great either. Too saucy. 3/5 THE BUFFALO ($14): A buffalo chicken sandwich. Another winner. 5/5 OH MY GOD ($10): A chocolatey dessert. Good, but a small portion for the price. I wish the brownie was softer and warmer. The chocolate ice cream was awesome. 4/5 DRINKS: Expensive AF, so I stick to water. The downer here is that the glasses are teeny tiny and refills are usually hard to come by.   As you can see, there's a plethora of options to choose from at TMV. This restaurant is my go-to for meals with friends.  YELP'S 2018 REVIEW CHALLENGE: #17",

Wish I got the waitresses name, she was super sweet at least.. The only thing I got to eat was the pulled pork on a pretzel bun (dripping in grease) which took 30min. It was just okay - I wouldn't recommend it. I also settled for cold soggy fries instead of sweet potato because they were out. I tried to order the mac n cheese bites but they were out of mac n cheese too (what?). Half way through my sandwich I ordered my dessert because of how long everything was taking. About 5 min after I was finished she finally came to let me know they were out of Oreos... like is this all foreal?! Service - slow. Food - overpriced. Environment - cute but loud (bar seats are not comfy). Location - weird. Like I first stated, extremely disappointed  Maybe this was an off day, I might give them a second try.",

Happily, we made it this time and this little gem will be one of the first places we head to when we come back next time.  Our waiter, Scott was super upbeat, helpful and made our dining experience even more pleasurable. The food...delicious! The vibe...modern for sure, thus the name! We tried the v'eggs Benny. Though delicious, the hollandaise sauce was a bit thick and a little too sweet for my liking. My hubby loves the sweet and savory but agreed that the sauce probably could have been thinned a bit. The portion was huge and splitting this dish a good option. The char on the tofu was really flavorful. I loved the savory part best. We tried the V Lobster roll. It was a pleasant change from the typical vegan sandwiches you can find other places. We had yummy smoothies and topped off our meal with the \"Baby Baby!\" Oh wow! Dessert on steroids! It was a chocolate and peanut butter sandwich that was deep fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar. It was like a beignet and fritter had a baby and the baby was gorgeously beautiful! Highly recommend! Say Hi to Scott for us too!",

Prices are crazy for some of the selections. $11 for the popcorn chicken (see pic) The pieces are probably size of a nickel maybe smaller  You can't call in a to-go order by phone. Only through grub hub where prices are increased. Seems like when you would previously call it was the owners personal cell phone.   Location leaves a lot to be desired.",

Definitely advise you to do the same!",

They'd benefit from some sound dampers on the ceiling as the place is a little echo-y",

I do want to say that the location of the restaurant is a little strange. It is located in a small, rather desserted off-strip market complex alongside of a 7-Eleven. It has a tinted black cover on its windows that doesn't give away how it looks from inside. That is a little weird! Although, as soon as you enter the restaurant, it looks pretty modern with all-white, contemporary decor. It is pretty big and has a lot of seating.  We ordered three items to split between four people - and spoilers - it was TOO MUCH! The portions are huge. We ordered the Breakfast Buddha Bowl, Breakfast Burritos, and Breakfast Tacos. All three were great, with the buddha bowl really standing out for me. It was made with zoodles, tofu scramble, and lots of veggies! I loved their preparation. I would just want you to REALLY think about how much you order if you don't want to box much of your food :)  Their menu is huuuge! So whenever I am in Vegas next, I will be going back to try something else and some dessert too :)",

We went super excited to try their food. My friend ordered two appetizers, Their Breakfast Potato and Loaded Nachos, both marked with GF. When the appetizers arrived, He wanted to order Burger (they do offer gluten free bun) with fries. Their fries also marked with GF on the menu but because of past bad experiences with \"fries\" He asked if they fry something with gluten in the same fryer. Since the waitress was new, he could not answer the question, so he went to the Chef to ask. In the meantime, He ended up eating 2 nachos. The waitress returned and said that their fries are not gluten free since the fried something with gluten in the same fryer. Therefore, also the Nachos and the breakfast potatoes are not gluten free. Too late for my friend!!!!  He was confused because on the menu the nachos and the breakfast potatoes were marked GF, and He could not see any warning on their menu about cross contamination. He asked the waitress to please call the chef so she can explain better what options are and to provide my friend with answers why they mark it GF when it is NOT!!!  Well, the waitress came with another person that claimed she is a \"dietitian\" and both apologize on behalf of the chef because the chef was \"too busy\". The person said that the do have 2 separate fryers but sometimes they just use one fryer to fry all their food. The Chef did not come out to say nothing!!! And when I got the bill, I was in shock to see that they did not even give discount for their mistake. My friend did not want to create a scene in the restaurant because we were with other guests. He just kept my self-calm and asked me to write this review. They definitely knew they were doing something wrong marking GF on their food when it is not!!!! My friend couldn't sleep the whole night, end up vomiting and having severe stomach pain. I wrote this review not to put their food down, the food was delicious. This restaurant should not mark their food GLUTEN FREE when in reality they don't use the dedicated gluten free fryer. This show lack of education!!! So, if you are Celiac, DO NOT go to this restaurant!!!!",

I'm talking chicken and waffles I'm talking grill cheese sandwiches, salads, soups, ice cream, pasta, I'm talking spicy crispy chicken sandwiches... Deep fried peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!!! The list goes on and on and on!   I mean give me a freaking break the parking is easy, the menu is huge, the staff is crazy accommodating, the price is right, They have cool stuff on the TVs, they have a full bar, they have plenty of room to accommodate big parties, and it's super close to the airport... and the food is absolutely epic! I have brought tons of people here that are not vegan but I absolutely love the place and have come on their own with coworkers and or family and friends just to have them go thru the same amazing experience.  The bar area is great to be able to pop in and grab something quick with a beer or a cocktail, or you can sit in the normal dinning area and take your time. Depending on what's happening in town this place can get a little bit dizzy the wait is never that bad.  The ambience here is super trendy with white furniture and white walls. Great music playing and great friends... makes a great time!   This is definitely a place that you're gonna want to check out! Vegan or not!",

But the validity tho   For a starter my friend and I shared the jalapeno poppers. They were bangin'! I ordered the chick'n and waffles! It was massive. Definitely enough for 2 people to share. It was so yummy! They unfortunately were out of mashed potatoes. Which now that I think about it, is weird, because they had French fries. So if the mashed potatoes were homemade and fresh they could have made them. Anyways I got fries instead. And was still stunned by the whole meal! The chicken pieces had a wonderful consistency and paired so nicely with the waffle. My friend had the Louisiana fried chick'n. I tried a few bites. It was also an exceptional meal.   This place is a little ways from the strip but worth the trek. Highly recommend!",

But this restaurant had lots of great reviews so it is the one that we finally settled on.   It is located in the Naples plaza. The main store in this plaza that you'll see on the corner is a 7-Eleven. The decorations inside the restaurant are modern, just like the name. The food is all vegan.   Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, which also comes with two pieces of garlic bread. The meatballs are not made from an animal but they taste very realistic. We also got a side of macaroni and cheese. It has crumbles of bacon, fake bacon, in it. The macaroni and cheese is some of the best I've ever tasted. And we got a CosmoPolitan smoothie. It is made with blueberries, banana, and peanut butter. It's really yummy.   The wait staff is friendly and helpful. There are no kid menus but there are side dishes that can be made into A kids meal. But overall the restaurant is not really designed with kids in mind, which is fine, but just to keep in mind if you are planning on bringing a bunch of kids like we did lol.",

First off, it's amazing to be able to look at a menu and choose from any food dish knowing it's vegan-friendly. It totally takes the stress out of eating. Secondly, the menu is HUGE! Go be vegan and have so many dishes to choose from is incredible. And breakfast options?! Sold and sold.  We started with the chips, salsa, guac and queso. You can tell the queso isn't \"real\" cheese but omgggggg it's delicious! It's soy-based and not cashew-based as I originally thought. My friend got the pad Thai and it was great. The peanut sauce taste is prominent but I love that in pad Thai so I was extremely happy with my sample of that dish. I got the teriyaki chicken sandwich and holllyyyyy moly so, so good. They literally have anything you can think of on this menu... we saw a chicken and waffles dish go by.... I was genuinely shocked something like that could be made vegan and look as good as it did to boot.   The onlyyyyyy downside to my experience here was the initial wait. I'm fine with waiting to be sat but no one even came to the front to acknowledge we were there... the couple ahead of us ended up pulling someone aside to ask about being sat. Even just a \"be right with you\" would have been sufficient. Once we were sat, the service was quick- our food was out well within a reasonable amount of time. The place is a bit small but there's a good mix of small and large tables so you can dine as a group or couple.   This is without a doubt one of my new favorite spots to eat! Even if you're not vegan, you may just love it. My friend isn't a vegan and he is already talking about going back.   P.S. the portions are big!",

The food was out of this world. Never had I had vegan food like this. The Big Mac was my top burger I've ever had. Everything tasted fresh and cooked to order. If you're vegan come here!",

The sauce literally was burning our eyes (very peculiar taste too).  Mango toast is great.  Beet salad - delish.  Decent drink selection.  Good time had by all.",

A+++  HUGE delish portions and a so many FUN options on this menu!  100% vegan takes on comfort foods you definitely crave after a long night out in Vegas.  Bottomless mimosas:  pick your juice(s) too!!  I loved my pineapple cranberry mimosas.  The waffle options so fabulous you may wipe away a tear of joy.    Very close to UNLV.  In a kind of sketchy-ish area, but not too bad.  Easy close parking in private lot shared with a few other businesses. Place is nice and clean inside, modern and casual. Well lit.  Lots of seating. Service was very friendly and pretty darn fast.  The bartender came out himself to refill our bottomless mimosas while checking if we liked them.  I really cannot wait to return.  Tried the chick'n and waffles, which came out literally the size of a derby hat.  These waffles would have been delicious dry and alone,  but they were sitting atop probably two cups of homemade mashed potatoes, sandwiching a golden crispy fried chick'n filet, and gloriously enveloped in maple syrup.  Two asparagus spears adorned the top, looking like tiny antennas on a carbtastic heap of goodness.",

One, they brought my plate out alone and my fiance's over five minutes later. Two, we asked for extra mayo on the side and they neglected to bring it out llke we asked, and 3, servers hardly come by, they're just not enough of them. They should address that or consider going to a counter-order system like Tocaya uses.  Being a cool, all-vegan restaurant is great, bravo!  But careless service is deal-breaker.  They should also hang tapestries or something to absorb sound, the noise level was intrusive.",

There is a bar area with screens for sports fans. Now the menu. Huge. Anything you are craving, they have. We got the fried 'chicken' with mash potatoes and slaw and the Thai Asian salad. I think because the seasoning was lumped in one area of the chicken, I got an entire mouthful of salt my first bite in. That was a little harsh and hence the one star off. The salad was nice, fresh and colorful. Another reason for the one star knock off is that our waitress brought our ice cream sundae 10min into our meal, so that all the ice cream pretty much melted by the time we got to it. Service is fast otherwise and off the beaten path away from the strip so parking easy.",

Our group was 2 vegans and 2 others(lol) whom thoroughly enjoyed their buffalo wrap and breakfast quesadilla as well.   The price point matched the food quality, service, and serving size. It's located in a small strip mall by UNLV. This place is a must try and I will definitely be back to try out more of the menu on future Vegas vacays.",

    "text": "This is an amazing vegan restaurant in Vegas! So glad I got to check it out on my recent trip. The menu is incredible--so many unique options! There were so many things I've never seen done vegan before! And trust me, I've been to MANY vegan restaurants and festivals and what not, I thought I'd seen it all but nope! I love the approach of making vegan food fun and exciting and well, MODERN.   I decided to go with the vegan gyro, simply because I haven't had a gyro in over 10 yrs and I have never seen a vegan one! Now, I don't even remember what gyros taste like so I can't say if it was realistic, but I definitely enjoyed the sandwich! I think the only thing is I wish there was more sauce , that may just be a personal preference though. The fries on the side were crispy and yummy! Ask for a side of ranch--theirs is delish with fries.  I also tried some of my family's food. All American burger was solid vegan burger goodness. Stuffed portobello steak (?) was surprisingly delicious. But my favorite was the Louisiana fried chick'n! Oh my godddddd. The chicken was good and was served on top of a delightful cloud of mashed potatoes--which were bomb! The portions are quite big and we were all stuffed but we sure saved room for dessert!  Their dessert menu was so poppin we couldn't resist! I had the hardest time deciding but we ultimately went with the I love you (I'm pretty sure). It was a icecream sundae served with a fried banana. Need I say more? So good!!  Our server was super friendly and very helpful--he gave us plenty of great recommendations. He took good care of us! The restaurant had a clean, modern aesthetic which I found to be unique but very cool.  Overall, my family and I had a great meal and experience. I'm a little bummed I live in LA because I think this may be one of the best vegan restaurants I've been to! If I'm in Vegas again I will DEFINITELY be hitting up this spot again!",

Also the indoor aesthetic is very nice!   Tip: Don't ever order the jerk chicken sandwich, it tastes so plain - definitely doesn't deserved to be labeled as \"jerk\" or any other type of seasoning for that matter. The tomato on the sandwich was also sliced far too thick. Poor execution overall.   What's worse is that a staff member asked me how everything tasted...looking at the 3/4 of the sandwich still on the plate, I mentioned that the jerk chicken sandwich should be removed from the menu and that the gravy (on the biscuits and gravy) was delicious. This prompted no request to have me order something else, no attempt to discount my bill. I still paid and tipped the waiter. But I do think you all should know in my 17 years of being plant based, I've never been so disappointed with a sandwich.   I imagine that other things on the menu might be  delicious!",

It gets many college students, but it's okay for everyone. The whole menu is vegan, so there's no need to ask questions about if something is vegan.   I had the Reuben the first time here. It's about $12 for the sandwich and a salad. The price is kind of high but you get a lot of food for that. It's a pretty big sandwich. The \"corned beef\" is made from tofu I think. It comes with a very good vegan cheese. This doesn't taste fake like some of the kinds in stores. It comes with a side of your choice. The salad isn't outstanding, but it came with a good dressing and was a nice compliment to the heavy sandwich.   It has a large menu. So many things to check out. They are also open for breakfast, so lots of options for any time.",

It was like walking into a club where you have to yell so you can hear each other.  Sorry, but I'm not a fan of this vegan place.",

    "text": "Sadly, this is the second time I've really been turned off here. The first was when I called to order something to be picked up on my way to work. I dont use credit cards, she said she'd let me do it this \"once.\" The sandwich was $15 and I paid with a $20. Fully expecting me to answer \"No I don't need any change\" when asked she was visibly disappointed when I said \"Yes\" and only gave her $3 instead of the $5 and pat on the head she felt she deserved for my \"One time only special cash pick up\" exception. Ugh.  Im not a fast learner apparently because I actually went back last week lol and found a note on the door, closed until Oct 10th. ?? Hungry today I thought maybe I can find out what's going on so I called. Low and behold they're open. I asked the girl what happened, just you know, curious, I had changed lunch plans with a friend the day I saw the note (VEGENATION DOWNTOWN ROCKS) just a simple 5 second answer would have been the polite thing, and she just hung up on me!!! Lol this is Las Vegas, I don't expect a lot but I'm MONEY on the phone, to just hang up on me?? I gave her the benefit of the doubt and called back. Asked her again what happened and she hung up on me AGAIN. Ugh 15 dollars for a sandwich x 2 x a week. Thats over $1500 in a year this place won't be seeing from me because a snotty little girl didn't feel like being polite. AND I'll NEVER recommend this place or bring a friend, AND my experience will be shared with anyone who'll listen, so add some more dollars on top of that.",

The breakfast burrito and potato's it came with were COLD and the burrito wasn't even wrapped so I had it eat it with a fork and knife.Service was pretty bad. Not rude or anything but In their own world and not attentive at all. Took 10 min to bring us hot sauce for the burrito and maple syrup for our waffles. When I asked for syrup the server seemed confused like oh more syrup? When literally there was nothing on the waffles. Overheard the owner telling customers that she doesn't care about bad reviews and that she will reply and tell them to never come back... don't know why you would take pride in that. Extremely loud in here too. Don't expect to be able to talk to whoever your with. There's a lot better vegan restaurants in LV...",

    "text": "This place was absolutely amazing! I went with my Bf and my friend(neither of them are vegan) and they thought the food was amazing! When we first entered, we were greeted with a smile by the woman at the door and we were seated immediately. The place is super cute inside and a lot bigger than I was expecting. The decor is so cute and the windows are all tinted so you're not catching and glares or heat from the outside. The menu has to be one of the most extensive vegan menus I have ever seen and I'm used to vegan restaurants because Los Angeles has a ton. This was definitely the biggest selection I have ever seen. It was as overwhelming as the Cheesecake Factory menu. They have breakfast options, wraps, burgers, salads, Thai inspired dishes, Mexican inspired dishes, and a bunch of desserts. Their portions are really big so keep that in mind. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my BF got the chicken and waffles. We could not finish both as they don't play around with the portions lol. Both were so good. The breading on their chicken is so crunchy and the chicken tastes so bomb! My friend could not believe he was eating vegan chicken. He was thoroughly impressed. I wish I could have tried more off of the menu, but we were stuffed afterwards. Also, they don't allow you to sub the onion rings for the fries, even at an additional charge. I was kind of bummed about that since you don't find many places with vegan onion rings. They do have it as a side order but I knew French fries and onion rings would have been too much food. I also got their strawberry rum drink called Desert Crush and it was so good!! When I am back in Vegas, I will be sure to hit this place up again!!",

    "text": "I sure hope the food tastes good because the to-go waitress/bartender was the worst. I sat at the bar to order. I spoke to her. She barley acknowledged me. I guess bucking your eyes and giving a fake smile means hello? I don't know. She didn't even ask if I wanted a drink while I sat there; didn't even offer water. She chatted with the other folks at the bar said, \"thank you\" and \"thanks\" to them. When it came to me there was nothing; no conversation. When she finally came over she said \"what are you getting?\" I gave her my order. I asked for grilled onions instead of raw onions. She acted as if it was a hassle ask about the onions, but order cook did too. He couldn't act too pained though because you can see him through the order/kitchen window. Maybe I shouldn't have asked for grilled onions, lol. Any who, she threw my bill on the counter and rushed away like she was sooooo busy. It didn't seem busy at all, but who knows? I paid. When she finally returned with my change, she placed if so far back that it was close close to falling behind the bar. She made eye contact with the guys next to me. She again made conversation with them and said, \"thank you\" when she handed them their bill. When she gave me my food she said \"thank you\" seemingly annoyed because I didn't leave a tip.  Trying to hold on to my initial excitement about eating here, I took my burger with barely grilled onions and left. I came back and asked for a refund. The GM was very nice. She allowed me to keep the food any way. All in all, the food, BFF burger, just was ok. The experience, however, was less than ok.",

The Louisiana chicken came with coleslaw and mashed potatoes. The chicken was tender and crunchy all at the same time. The only downside I would say was that the Mac and cheese was a little bland. It required a bit more salt n pepper . However, the service was quick and the wait for food was less than 10 min. We were pleasantly surprised when it came back so quick!! When I'm in Vegas again I will surely look this place up again!!!",

So happy I don't have to travel to Costa Mesa for a good vegan Ruben sandwich anymore!  There are a ton of items on the menu however,  they were out of many of the options including juice and smoothies.

My only criticism is that the service can be super inconsistent. Usually the service is decent, but there have been a few order mix-ups and long waits. One of the waitresses that never fails to impress is a short Asian/Polynesian(?) woman who usually has a bun in her hair -- sorry, I wish I could remember her name! She's super friendly and every time that she's who comes to take our order, I know the service will be great.",

A few employees walked by us and said we will be right with you, which in their language means \"I am too busy to help you, but maybe someone else will.\"  Some lady (looked like the owner) eventually came over and sat us down and just walked away.  No nice welcome.  No drink offer.  No menus.  No service... We waited for 15 min and NOBODY came over to say anything... We started yelling other locations.  Maybe we will find the grace to give it another try some other day.",

Creamy chicken with some celery for crunch and cranberries for a hint of sweetness, all served on two thick slices of sourdough. It reminded me of sandwiches my grandma used to make for me--except veganized! One star off for being closed on Monday and Tuesday. I hope their hours will expand after they get past the launch period. Las Vegas is so lucky to have a vegan option like this.",

Everything we ordered  Louisiana chicken, lobster roll, cauliflower buffalo wings were incredible. I could bring meat eaters here and show them what's up- and not hear a complaint!

They were sold out of the fried cheddar, but we went ahead and tasted the Mac and Cheese. Definitely delicious! Honestly it's in my top three vegan macaroni and cheeses of all time. And I'm picky when it comes to that. Now, understand too that this top-3 Mac and Cheese was the worst thing in this list. Everything else was PHENOMENAL. We ordered corndogs -- the batter is absolutely delicious. Boyfriend had the buffalo burger and if you've read any of the reviews here for it -- you know it's awesome. I went out of my comfort zone and ordered the Louisiana fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. Honestly hats off to our very patient waitress (I wish I'd gotten her name but she knows who she is!) who convinced me to give the gravy a try (I was afraid it would have a strong taste of mushroom when I saw the pics and that's just not my thing)! But it was AMAZING. Tender, juicy, savory and spiced perfectly. There was no hint of mushroom whatsoever. Seriously. You guys. Order THAT. Start there and then try everything else on the menu.   We also had smoothies (I got the Flamingo and he got the Tropicana).  Both were awesome. Mine was better   We ordered two additional meals to-go because we wanted to grab as much as we could since we don't live on that side of town: the Philly Cheese and the Rueben sandwiches. I didn't take a bite of my Philly, but the bf took a bite of his Reuben before we left and swears it is the best Reuben he has ever had in his LIFE (this includes real-meat ones)! He said the flavor was on point, the sourkraught was good and crisp and the, \"meat,\" was juicy and not dry like others he's had.  My point is: this place has a HUGE menu, and we got 8 items off the list and they were all fantastic. Don't think this is variety without quality taste. I am honestly blown away by the time and effort that must have been put into opening this restaurant and offering customers the sheer amount of amazing choices. Seriously. We were both impressed.  Not only that but every staff member I interacted with was friendly, courteous and helpful, and honestly I was having a really scary and awful day to cap off some pretty rough weeks and none of them even knows how much this whole experience cheered me up. It was just good food and good people who really cared about their craft. I've still got a lot to deal with, but today at least, will will stand out in my memory a little bit more and for a better reason than it would have been if we'd not decided to give the place a go.   Everyone I know will be hearing about this place from me.   Update: I tasted the Philly when I got home and I can confirm it too is fantastic.",

Turns out, they let a GrubHub driver take it \"30 minutes ago\". It's fine, mistakes happen. But the owner (husband) just kind of said \"don't know what to tell you\". Ummm, I don't know, how about \"so sorry about that, i can get another order in for you right now\". Nope. Not this guy. He's too spoiled or lazy (or both) to be bothered with providing the product/service that his customer has already paid for. I (the customer) have inconvenienced him by showing up to his restaurant to pick up the food I've purchased.   Never experienced this before at any business, let alone a vegan business. The owner (husband) behaved like a spoiled trust fund kid. Like he couldn't care less.   WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD, AT ANY BUSINESS. PERIOD.   I wouldn't go back to this place if it was next door to my house.",

    "text": "As a vegan, I'm sad to say that I was very disappointed with my experience here. I was weary of this place from the get go because of their GIGANTIC menu. The menu is huge and allllll over the place. From waffles, to pad Thai, to poutine? I think that restaurants are usually better off sticking with smaller menus and having a few amazing dishes rather than dozens of just-okay dishes. I think this is definitely a problem here.   My boyfriend and I ordered three dishes: the poutine, Louisiana chicken, & the lobster roll. The poutine was the best dish of the bunch, but it still wasn't great. First of all, for an appetizer, the portion was MASSIVE. The fries seemed to be unsalted and a bit under done. The cheese and gravy was just ok, nothing memorable. The Louisiana chicken dish was similar. It was nothing more than just ok. The fried chicken looked good, but it just didn't taste quite right. I've had lots of vegan fried chicken from a variety of restaurants- but this tastes like something you buy frozen and heat up in your microwave. The coleslaw was also not good, it also tasted like something you'd get at a grocery store. The mashed potatoes were probably the best part of the dish, but still nothing I'd go back for. The lobster roll looked great but the taste and texture was just... awful. I never send food back but I had to with this dish, especially considering the high prices here. They took it off the check with no problems and I really appreciated that.  (Although I didn't enjoy the food much- I do want to say that everything was plated quite beautifully!)   Besides the food, the service was pretty good and everyone was very nice. The decor wasn't bad, however it was a confusing feel. It's like they mixed together a fancier restaurant with a fast casual cafe. They had a gigantic bar but such a small kitchen, which just didn't make sense to me. If the restaurant closes at 6pm, is a huge bar really necessary? I've worked as a cook in a couple different restaurants and I cannot begin to fathom how they cook everything on their menu in their tiny kitchen. It blows my mind. I currently work at a restaurant with a menu 1/3 the size of their menu, but our kitchen is 3x the size of theirs! This is probably part of the reason the quality of the food was lacking. I feel like the owners might not come from a food service background, or were maybe just too ambitious?   Overall, I really, really wanted to like this place and I hate to see a vegan business do poorly. However, I  think there's a lot of things that need to be fixed for the restaurant to live up to its potential. With a much smaller (& more focused) menu, revamping the kitchen, and maybe bringing in someone with more experience in this industry this place could be successful.",

I had to remind our server that I was still missing the Mexicana and when she comes back with the plate it was cold and seemed to have been sitting at the counter waiting for someone to pick it up.  Food overall taste was okay, I tasted my friends chicken and waffles which was pretty good. I had a few bites of my own food but the chick'n was cold and pretty tasteless. because of the service I won't be coming back which is unfortunate as I love to support vegan businesses.",

The best example is there Mac and cheese,  my wife bought some Mac and Cheese by Daiya and it looked/tasted like the same Mac and Cheese from here.

    "text": "Outside of my main careers, 2 things I have worked with the most are food and customer service. Both need to be present at any restaurant worth anything, & both need to be good, or at least decent, for any restaurant to deserve paying customers. I won't go back to TMV, because the food was overpriced & mostly disappointing, and the customer service was for the most part shockingly nonexistent or bad, depending on the moment. Everything on the menu is $3 to $5 more expensive than would be reasonable, & the portions and quality do NOT back up the inflated prices. Out of 4 entrees and 2 appetizers, only 2 items were really enjoyable...the \"jalapeno poppers\" & the \"meatball sub\". Couldn't find much flavour in the \"eggs benny\", the buffalo caesar wrap, the philly cheesesteak, or the \"mac n cheese balls\" (sauce was great but the balls had zero flavour). I love vegan food. I have cooked it/served it/catered it/sought it out, and hoped for the best at many places, since I became vegan in 2001. This place is NOT where I would send someone looking to experience good vegan food for their first time. Even if the customer service wasn't some of the worst I've ever seen, I'd hesitate to go back & try more dishes here. The menu looks eclectic and amazing, but it's hard to justify a return visit, & such high prices, when only 2 out of 6 items purchased were satisfying. Aside from needing to have DELICIOUS food, I believe every vegan restaurant needs EXCELLENT customer service, or at least enough to make every guest feel welcome & appreciated. It's an opportunity to be ambassadors to non-vegans, a chance to welcome people into (ideally) a pleasant, cruelty-free atmosphere, with (ideally) yummy, satisfying food. So about that customer service... First, the phone number leads straight to an answering machine (during biz hours), so that's kind of special... Having arrived, of the 6 staff members I interacted with out of necessity, 1 was awesome, 1 was pleasant and helpful, & 4 ranged from careless to shockingly rude. First the positive...Jordan, cleaning glasses behind the bar was classy, helpful, & kind, & he should really be training the rest of the staff on how to be friendly & professional. The gal at the window to the kitchen (possibly the owner, who seems to like making snarky responses on these reviews) was friendly, smiling, & promptly answered three questions I had regarding ingredients, even running to the back to check ingredients listed on packages. On the downside...the hostess promised faster service if we sat at the bar, telling me I didn't need to carry a menu with me, only to leave us at the bar with no menus. Once food started arriving, I politely asked a young food runner for utensils...twice, cuz the first time he half-heartedly called out to one of the girls working the bar & then disappeared, until I caught him walking by & asked again. Of the two ladies behind the bar, both of whom ignored my gf and I for a LONG time before taking our orders...the younger server flashed us a smile once or twice, but really seemed to have no time for us...and the older of the two, whom I initially flagged down to ask my simple ingredients questions, showered us with neglect & disrespect. She first told me I should ask her fellow bar server \"when she's done making things\", then after a LONG wait, told me I should go talk to the cooks, because apparently neither of the bar servers know much about the food, nor are capable of relaying questions to cooks or managers...so off I went to chat with the gal putting finished plates in a window. When I mentioned we were going to be ordering 2 additional entrees to go, our server said, \"You'll have to box it up yourself, cuz we don't do that\". I asked, \"What about when people just come & order food to go?\"  \"We don't do that\", was again the answer. Do they have boxes & containers? Yes, yes they do. Will they hand one to the cooks, or designate an order as \"to go\"? No, no they won't. In all my days of waiting tables, of boxing leftovers up for people, & neatly packaging carryout items, I never imagined I would find a restaurant with such ludicrous policies & excuses. At one point, I discovered our check was on the counter just to my right. There had been no formal delivery of said check, no \"Anything else?\", no \"Thank you\", nothing at all. Upon glancing at the check, I noticed a charge for extra ranch, which we didn't order nor receive. I mentioned it to the ladies behind the bar, which resulted in the older server in the bandana grimacing, grabbing the bill from me, printing out an adjusted bill, & tossing it toward me on the counter with no apology. We paid the bill, & she tossed my credit card & receipt to sign, dropped on the counter with no eye contact, no gracious word, no thanks or farewells, just...nothing. This wasn't just 1 person having a bad day. Most of the staff seemed bummed to be there. Lots of young, funky looks, but barely any smiles. No \"Vegas, baby!\" It was sad.",

    "text": "Firstly, let me start by apologizing for the length of the review. I want to put in every detail of my experience with this place. Secondly, I want to say that I am glad to see more truly vegan restaurants are popping up and after reading some of the reviews for The Modern Vegan, I was pretty excited for my boyfriend and I to try it on our Vegas trip this past weekend. This review is not from someone who hasn't tried good and flavorful vegan food before, and therefore has no idea what actual flavor is like. I am no newbie to the vegan scene. I live in SoCal where we have plenty of vegan restaurants. Some bursting with flavor and some not so much. SO that being said, I have some things to say about this place.   Yesterday (4/15/18), my boyfriend and I tried to call to ask if we needed to make a reservation after hearing that they are really busy. We called 3 times and the phone went straight to voicemail each time. Weird, but that wasn't about to deter us from going to what we thought was going to be our new spot to eat when we come to Vegas.   We walk in and the hostess told us there would be a 10 minute wait which is really not bad at all but then she suggested that we could sit at the bar  where they serve the full menu and get faster service. We go to the bar and waited for a few minutes before we were able to get someone's attention to ask for menus. I should mention there were at least 3 people behind the bar and not one of them acknowledged us when we sat down or offered us menus. After perusing the menu, we have some of our options for food narrowed down and we wanted to ask a question regarding the ingredients to a dish to see if it had hydrogenated oil. By the way, research hydrogenated oil if you don't know what it is. It's essentially not food and like one molecule away from tupperware, but I digress.   There was a lady with a bandana in her hair and she seemed nice enough as she asked us if we would like a drink. I ordered a drink and my bf asked if she knew the answer to our question. She didn't know but didn't offer to go to the back and ask the cook or offer for us to see an ingredient list. She told us to wait for this other girl behind the bar (has a partially shaved head) because she might know the answer. I believe she went and told shaved head girl that we had a question for her and she honestly never came over to talk to us. We got the attention of the bandana lady and she again acted like she couldn't do anything remotely resembling good customer service and after a while of us going back and forth with her and telling her we couldn't wait all day for someone to answer our question (seriously guys we were waiting a long time for shaved head girl to come over), she finally told us to walk up to a window where we could see the kitchen and ask the cooks ourselves. So my bf walked over to the window and talked to a woman who was cooking. She was very personable and was able to answer our question very well.   After finding out that they do not, in fact, use hydrogenated oil, we were able to place our order. Again, we had to wait for a while for someone (remember there were multiple people behind the bar) to come and take our order. Shaved head girl finally came over and she seemed nice enough and we told her we wanted to order a couple things for there and then a couple things to go to eat later. We ordered Jalapeno Poppers and Mac and Cheese Balls to start. The Jalapeno Poppers were really good and the peppers had a great spice to them. The Mac and Cheese Balls, on the other hand, were really bland and lacking in flavor. We did love the dipping sauce that came with both of the appetizers. For entrees we ordered the Eggs Benny and the Meatball Sub. The Eggs Benny was pretty tasteless and boring but the Meatball Sub, though severely over priced especially because it wasn't that big, was actually pretty tasty and meatball subs are one of my favourite dishes when done right.     When our food was brought to us, it was brought without utensils and we had to ask the same guy twice before he brought them. During our meal, nobody checked in with us to see how we were doing or if we liked the food. Not one person looked our way the entire time. Finally, shaved head girl brought us our check and walked away. After informing the bandana lady that we had wanted to order more food to go, she told shaved head girl who said \"more food?!\" with a disgusted look on her face. Remember, we had already informed her we wanted more food for later. We get our food and we had to box it up ourselves because apparently they \"don't do that\". We got our bill ($92!! insanely overpriced) and they had charged us for something we didn't order. After taking the item off, bandana lady tossed the receipt back to my bf along with major attitude. Needless to say it was the first time in our lives we didn't leave a tip for a server.   This place was overpriced and overly hyped.  Don't waste your time or money.",

    "text": "Don't order the jalapeno poppers. At $11 for 3 poppers that are full of seeds like they didn't even bother removing them. We couldn't even eat them they were so spicy. My husband bit into one and immediately turned red and started coughing, he's used to eating very spicy food and jalapeno poppers don't even faze him normally. upon inspection of the jalapeno we find a shit ton of seeds not like they accidentally left some in but like they never even tried to remove them. So my husband is sitting there dying while we have nothing to drink because one of the glasses of tap water they brought us was full of floating stuff and was disgusting and he had already finished the other small glass with no waitress in sight to refill us. $11 wasted on an inedible appetizer. They charge $3 a glass for ice tea. The other food we ordered was good. When we finished we asked the waitress if they normally leave all of the seeds in the jalapenos and explained they were so excruciatingly hot we couldn't eat them. She said the kitchen told her sometimes they will accidentally leave some in and she doesn't know what happened maybe they were in season that's why they were so hot. I'm just sitting there like ummm ok. She apologized but we still had to pay for some crap we couldn't eat. I'll never come back here with dirty water and people that obviously don't know how to make what they serve. Not worth the money! Booo on you Modern Vegan",

SOOOOO happy to see this menu after LV had zero vegan options for forev.  The menu is HUGE and I've tried many things on here and it's some of the best vegan food I've ever had. Seriously even down to the iced coffee it's worth coming back and trying so many different things on the menu.  ONLY reason why I'm giving four stars out of five is that the service/food can be kind of inconsistent. I could have a so-so server who forgets water, doesn't get orders correctly, etc. or the best service I've ever had. Same with the food. For example, their buffalo chik'n burger was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. But their Flamingo smoothie was super lacking in flavor for a smoothie and the baked mac n cheese was super liquidy and didn't seem baked. I hope they add to their dessert section! Nothing that wouldn't ever have me coming back.",

Luckily , it's amazing in real life too!  A friend and I came in around 10:30am on a Sunday for brunch and we were seated right away. We were given menus and water. We decided what we wanted rather quickly, and our waitress (who was great) was able to take our food and drink orders together.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the Chick'n Waffles which was amazing. Looked just like the photos I've seen and it tasted great! My friend got the biscuits and gravy and enjoyed that too. One thing to note here is the portion sizes are GIGANTIC. Seriously, my friend and I could have just split one entree and not even finished. I wish I could have taken my leftovers home, but sadly I had a long drive to San Diego ahead of me. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas, and I definitely want to try some dessert!",

I don't know why this place has any of those kinds of reviews because this place is the.  B o m b!

I shouldn't have to ask for anything when being served food such as .. napkins, utensils, more water, and condiments. That should be a given. The food is not good at all except breakfast. Extremely overpriced for what you get.. just because the portion is big doesn't mean ur paying for quality or taste. It's unfortunate I would rather go to Vegenation or even chef Kenny's vegan restaurant is 10 times better. If you want mediocre food with poor service try out TMV.",

I was recommended this place by a friend in vegas and after hearing that they have 200+ options of 100% vegan choices, I had to go. I will say, I was not impressed with the location but I'm super excited to hear that they're building a location in Reno (where I live) coming next summer.   The ambiance is upscale, modern, with clean lines and mainly white but with some brighter colors. It's beautiful inside. The menu is a bit intimidating but it's beyond amazing. They have anything from burgers to tacos to waffles to chicken to dessert. And it's 100% vegan. The pictures of the food do not do it justice and I was pleasantly surprised about the quality, flavors, and amount of food.   My friend and I wanted to order one menu item each and split another as sort of an appetizer. I got the cauliflower chicken wings with buffalo sauce, she got a burger and we split fish tacos. WOW. those tacos are enough to keep me a customer for years to come and be super impatient about their arrival in Reno. Additionally the wings were AMAZING and totally not what I was expecting. The vegan ranch complimented them perfectly and I. Want. More.   Can't wait to go back to vegas to try more and anxiously await its arrival here!!! 10/10 recommend.",

That is ridiculous. Oh, not to mention the waitress forgot to mention that it's a $3 up charge if you want onion rings or sweet potato fries as your side (which we did). For the location of this place (ghetto) it's just over priced for the quality you receive. The lemonade was the best part... will not be returning",

Such great food, so tasty and creative. All vegan. How they make vegan hollandaise sauce I'd really like know. Really. It was fantastic.   Our second visit was on the way out of town on Tuesday. Google said it was closed so we called. They are now open on Tuesday with a limited menu. Mostly Mexican food, breakfast and lunch were both available at 11 when we arrived. My husband had churro french toast. WOW!!! It was just incredible. I had a carne asada burrito with red and green sauce. So delicious. They don't skimp on the portions either.   The service is great. The manager came around and asked about our food, checking to be sure everything was just right.   The menu is incredible. So many mainstream dishes you never think you will have again once you have gone vegan are at this unique spot. I wish they would open a location in my hometown. I would eat there every day.  I highly recommend this spot and will return again and again.",

I have tried a few restaurants here and in California and yet The Modern Vegan has stolen my heart. Not only because of the food but because of the owner. She was so patient, helpful and very knowledgeable.   Ok so about the food I ordered the Mac & Cheese Balls, Buffalo Chik'n Sandwich and of course BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!!! Let's take a moment of silence........ (Pause)   The Mac & Cheese balls are AMAZING!!! full of flavor by themselves and when you add the sauce ..... explosion. The balls were baseball sized (2per order) and had a great Panko-like crispy texture outside. Inside was warm, cheesy and creamy.   Buffalo Chik'n Sandwich equally delicious. Even though the Chik'n was dipped in buffalo sauce it was still crispy. It was dressed with a garden mix & avocado.   As far as Service, it was great!!!!!! Our waiter made sure we were doing well and you can tell the owner put a lot of heart into this wonderful place.",

Customer service was great, everyone kept apologizing however they had nothing to apologize for there was no delay or anything. Now this a big pet peeve, and lots of resturants do it and i feel it is unacceptable. When someone orders an appetizer that comes before your entree to hold you over, if you bring the appetizer with the entree first thats too much to eat at once, also it make the table a cluster eff with plates everywhere. Please can restuarants stop this, its resturant management 101. Now most people think fried foods take no skill, but they are complex because the outside can be cooked but the inside can be cold unfortunately that is what happened with the mac and cheese baseballs. Maybe just check the temp before hand. My sons frenchie came out about half way through our meal, mostly because i think they may have forgot. He ate my fries though so not too big of an issue. The lobster roll was good, i wont fault them it just wasnt what i wanted on my taste buds (they were out of what i really wanted) the regular mac and cheese was luke warm but that could be because out of precedent i wouldnt eat it until i finished my appetizer. But it was much better then the fried baseballs. My boyfriend LOVED his southern fried chicken and i loved my sons frenchie. Then dessert we got the banana split. I would have really loved if it was a normal banana split i havent had one since i went vegan 6 years ago. However it was very good. As stated i see a lot of potential for the atmosphere, menu and price. Just some kinks to work out and then place could be perfect!",

Our waiter came by and introduced himself and was really polite and friendly, also informing us that the kitchen is free flowing before we ordered, so food comes out when ready which was helpful so no questions asked.  I asked the waiter for ice and lemon, he had no problem with it and even brought a carafe because the glasses are a bit short, which I thought was really cool.  My husband ordered a lemonade I tried a sip and it was refreshing, but needed more sweetness to it.  So I think he will order something different next time.  The food,  I was craving a buffalo chicken and mac n cheese so we order that and split everything also from a pic I saw here on yelp a deep fried PB and J we asked the wait staff and he said it was the app called PB Delight it wasnt what we expected but it was still good, the bread was a 9grain and fruits were fresh.  The buffalo chicken sandwhich was so delish! Crispy goodness and fresh veggies and the pretzel bun was great!  The side mac n cheese came before everything we devoured it, the flavor was on point.  I'll definately return to try the nachos and another chicken sandwhich...maybe even a dessert",

They have a variety of options, it's like a Vegan Denny's! I liked that they had healthy light options too. The breakfast bowls were HUGE! All the portions were big you can definitely share all items from the menu. The customer service was great as well! Yvette and her staff do a great job.

They brought the coffee and said they had no idea if the agave was added. Then came the $3.00 shot glass of coconut milk. I had soup and sent it back. Tasted like salt and more salt. My daughter ordered french toast and it took 30 mins. Was so behind they asked if we wanted it to go. Umm no she would like to eat it now. Disappointed and will not go back. The biscuits and gravy was good. Breakfast skillet was just ok. Heard a whole speech of how they are awaiting the tesla of waffle makers. Who cares.",

Nice clean environment and friendly service. Will definitely be going back!",

The menu has a bit of everything so your bound to find something you might be craving.  I ended up getting the Ruben and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was so good.

Pretty expensive but I guess not many vegan options around in Vegas for competition. Not a big fan of their Phad Thai, seemed a bit less on the flavor and seasoning. Huge huge selection on the menu, can be a bit confusing but a number of great options to try.  Overall, if I am in Vegas again, I will certainly visit this place few times during my stay to try different things on their menu.",

The menu is massive--I mean really, really extensive and can suit any desire.  I had the buffalo cauliflower and \"chicken\" popcorn and both were crazy good. Excellent side sauces. My man had the tofu pinwheel and it was just so-so, but his \"pulled pork\" burger on a pretzel bun was great (best bun ever, he says).  He wants to come back and try the \"cheese steak\" because he feels like they understand \"meat\" textures here. Next time, I want to try their \"chicken soup\" and one of their salads--and I definitely want to have one if not both of their interesting avo toast options. Very creative takes on a staple.  The staff was extremely friendly and upbeat and several people were servicing our table, so we never needed to ask for or wait for anything.  The food came out quickly, the tastes were exceptional, and the ambience was modern, yet casual, so I think it's a great place to take people who are committed vegans, transitioning into vegetarianism, or full-blown meat eaters.",

    "text": "Disappointed in this place- but probably because my expectations were set high as I had received so many recommendations.  I came here last Thursday around 6 and the place was pretty much empty. I sat first and waited for my friend to join me. I'm big on service and this place lacked just that. Browsing the menu while I waited, the lobster role caught my eye; wondering what the substitute for the \"lobster\" was I decided to ask our server as the menu just described it as a \"super secret recipe\".  I couldn't tell if she was new or just extremely awkward- asking her questions almost made me uncomfortable (that's how bad it was). Anyways, her response to the lobster substitute question was \"I don't think they'll tell me because it says super secret\" lol what-- what if I have an allergy. Weird. Another woman who looked like a manager later advised us it was heart of palm.   We ordered the fish tacos, the Buffalo, and the lobster roll. The fish tacos were mediocre at best and really lacked flavor. The buffalo, on the other hand, was exceptional FULL of flavor and the chicken substitute had great texture- highly recommend! The lobster roll was massive but was absolutely horrible- the sauce they smother it in is so overpowering and ruins the whole thing. It does not taste like a lobster role whatsoever; even with consideration of it being \"vegan\".   Service was definitely lacking but I'd give them the benefit of the doubt as the place is still pretty new. Food was \"eh\" but the menu was very extensive so I'd probably give them another try. I'm still team Vegenation for now though.",

    "text": "Let's get down to business.  First of all. I hate giving 1 stars, I love seeing vegan places open up and grow. I love the ambience of the place. Modern, nice and white good for the eyes. All the servers, hosts were awesome! Tatted up, different styles, they were free and I love that about this place so as far as customer service that's a 5 star for me. The employees are all 5 stars because it made me happy that they didn't need to wear a uniform and just dressed as they pleased kind of feeling.  I'm upset o have to give this rating but I am because the pricing of the food is ridiculous for the quality. I dont mind spending $50+ on a couple items as long as that stuff is good but no go for me here.   Now, it's time to be cut throat because we are now talking about the food industry as I own 2 places myself here in Las Vegas. People being cut throat with me is how one of my places is doing so well because I turned tragic into triumph.   Down to the food:  $5 Side of baked mac n cheese: Tasted like cardboard, not only once but after every single bite tasted like cardboard. Bland, the flavor was off and there was just something missing. I think it was the cheesiness part, I finished it though cause there's was like 6 bites because of the portion size, or maybe my fatass was just making it 6 bites. Lol.   $8 New York New York Smoothie: Was not a smoothie, it was a chunky chocolate milk. I couldn't taste much, all the flavors of the banana, cacao, agave were so light. Thus far, it was good but I tasted the stinginess of ingredients in the drink.   $15 Biscuits and Gravy: Gravy tasted like it was sitting in a stainless steel container for a couple days. Like, canned gravy with a lot of herbs and some rusty metallic flavor. Biscuit had no flavor, flat top on butter? With a little garlic powder. Rosemary infused butter maybe? Mashed potatoes, I know have been sitting in a container. Discoloration, the texture and the moisture of water coming out of the mash I knowing it's been sitting. Bland.  $11 Zuchini Fritters: chopped up zucchini inside a ball of unseasoned flour and some gooey stuff which I think should have been cheese. It was my least favorite item I've gotten out of this meal. The texture was good but the flavor was just not having it, this item was poorly put together. The tzatziki sauce was good though.  $14 Buffalo Burger: Soft Pretzel bun, with a breaded chick'n tossed in buffalo. Not bad at all. I liked it, fries were unseasoned, at least mine were but the burger wasn't half bad. I took it to go.  The problem I see having a big menu is that the lack of flavor falls off all of the items. I didn't get to taste it all but as of asking the server the most popular items I got 2 of them. I most likely will be back because I want to change this review but as of today it's a 1 star for me. I came here from all the hype on the LAS VEGANS GROUP page but that all got shot down.",

    "text": "It was yesterday. I was visiting Las Vegas. We went to the modern vegan restaurant and we order a burger. It took them 30 minutes to get the burger and then we noticed that it wasn't as I ordered it (mean wail my friend gut its food )so with lot of smiles I ask them to \"fix it please\" and they took the burger back to the kitchen. 30 minutes later I got my burger back and again it was with nothing that I asked in it (they latterly just gave me that burger to shush me) The problem is that they didn't put me in priority to get my food first so I was literally waiting more than an hour to get my food. While I could see so many Burgers coming out of the kitchen... One of the reasons that I'm writing it here in \"Yelp\" it's because how the management deal with me.  They looked at me like I'm the \"annoying\" one with their body language and with short of patience to me and with words like \"so what do you want now\"... Nonetheless the manager tried to charge me for the frys that I was snacking while I'm waiting for my food. So I asked for the owner that was in the restaurant (actually in the kitchen) that time and the manager didn't let me talk to him/her. She prevented me to talk to the owner to tell him what was the problem with my experience at my first time in this restaurant. I felt very not welcomed there. It's really doesn't matter how good the food is wail the experience was really bad and quite upsetting. I have to say that the waitress was great and very delightful (it was her third day at work) She showed us the 'order' and it was fine. They messed up at the kitchen.",

I recently turned vegan and was amazed with the numerous about of vegan spots around the Henderson area. I heard great reviews about the Modern vegan via yelp. So I tried it for myself. 5 stars! As soon as u arrive to the parking lot you can tell this place is going to be delicious . The decor and detail of the place matches the menu. I arrived around 4 and the friendly hostess greeted me. I ordered the mac n cheese balls but they ran out & also ran out of sweet potatoes fries. When I heard that I knew this place was poppin. The waitstaff and bartenders were absolutely the most friendliest people to wait on me.   Now let's talk about the food! I got the jalapeno poppers and baked mac n cheese! DELICIOUS ! Hands down the best vegan mac n cheese I've ever tasted. It was creamy but not thick. Every bite was a water fall in my mouth! The poppers were just as good. The filling wasn't too much , just right. It mixed well with the house sauce that comes with it, and a Jameson neat.   I will definitely come back to this place in three months !",

First off, the restaurant itself is very nice and clean and a little unexpected to find a vegan restaurant in this area. For starters, we had PB delight, ahhhmazing! For entrees, I ordered their famous chicken and waffles and spaghetti and meatballs for my husband. Both were delicious and big portions! And for dessert we had Oh my God! And yes it was OMG good!!!   I'm taking a star away due to the service, host was on the phone for a couple of minutes while we were standing in front of her and did not even acknowledge us. No hi/hello or welcome, and rolled her eyes right in front of us! Also, our food took 45min to come out, server was very apologetic and offered us dessert so it was all good!  I definitely recommend this new vegan restaurant in town!",

I am cautiously optimistic to go back. I would love to have another Vegan restaurant in rotation!  *old review* They say the Modern Vegan is pretty good. It's hard to tell as the service is horrible.  Walked in on a Sunday afternoon to the restaurant being a quarter full and stood there roughly 5 minutes before being greeted with an \"I'll be right with you.\" After standing around another three minutes I gave up. Conversely, I went to the No Fur Cafe which was equally as full with 1/3 of the staff and was greeted immediately. The food was great also.  There aren't only two vegan restaurants anymore. Far too much competition to get away this. I hope they turn the service around so I can at least try and see if the food is good or not.",

I've been plant-based for the better part of 15 years. I ordered The Modern Vegan via Uber Eats. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! In fact, it's so good that I called them when I finished eating to let them know it tasted like \"sex\" in my mouth. I ordered the breakfast burrito, and asked that they leave out the corn. It was perfect! My daughter had the waffles with fruit, and I had one, because their portion sizes are so big that it fed my husband, my daughter, and myself. Run to The Modern Vegan with your mouth wide open, and don't look back.",

None the less I need this place close to me in California so I can try the entire menu. It's far above many Vegan places I have been to. Now the CONS....SERVICE... subpar to say the least.  Waitresses are young and non observant.  Walked past my table 4x and didnt remove empty plates and trash...I felt they were more attentive to talking among themselves then checking on the customers. I had to bite my tongue a couple times at the fact my.waitress swept the floors, played in her hair and then handled food....that's horrible. All in all I will 100% return cause let's face it...good vegan is hard to find and worth the trouble.  My 4 stars was due to service,  NOTfood.",

I looked around at the other 4 customers who were in there and told the waitress that they weren't very busy.... she said it didn't matter. I asked if I could talk to the manager about the seating she said no. Then they seated a party of five there.... I would like to say that the menus looked like they had a lot of options, but the menu aesthetics weren't appealing. The restaurant vibe was not up to par. I decided to leave because the service was not pleasant. I told them thanks but I am deciding I want to go somewhere else... as I was walking out, the lady there who was servicing us said \"men will be men\" which is very sexist.

    "text": "While visiting from out of state we had researched vegan places to eat in Vegas and we were most excited about TMV, unfortunately from the very beginning it was not a great experience. One food item we ordered was unavailable so we chose another, this was told to us after the waitress had already put in the order so we had to choose another item. That food item, what happens in Vegas, came out and we were told our other dish should be up shortly. It had been at least 5 minutes since the first dish came out when the general manager approached the table saying that the waffle machine was actually broken and I wouldn't be getting my chicken and waffles and to order something else. I then chose the V'Eggs Benny and it definitely left a lot to be desired. The hollandaise sauce had a weird sweet cashew/soy milk flavor you often find in vegan sauces with little flavor of anything else and everything was one consistent texture of mushiness. The What Happens in Vegas was good, though as mentioned came out way before the other order and was then cold when it came time to eat. The manager gave us a $1.50 off though in hindsight we really should have only paid half of what we did as the entire experience from start to end was met with issues. Wish we would have spent our time and money elsewhere.  UPDATE:  Just changed to one star after after reading previous reviews and how the owner reacts to negative reviews and I'm appalled I even stepped foot in this place. Honestly we didn't even notice gratuity was already added to the check as we were so ready to get out and on with our day, unfortunately we ended up tipping them close to double what they deserved for subpar service and seriously bad and bland food. There were so many better vegan spots in Vegas that you can enjoy during your visit, don't waste your time here.",

    "text": "I haven't reviewed anywhere in a long time, but this experience put such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to come out of the woodwork.   I went here on a Friday afternoon during a lull, so you would think we would receive great service, right? WRONG. We put in an order for a ginger ale, mac & cheese balls, a waffle, and a Reuben. The mac & cheese balls were never put in - we ended up getting them at the end of our meal and we were so full we didn't eat more than a bite. I was also not too impressed with the taste of them - the sauce is a saving grace. The noodles were pretty dry and the bacon they put in them overpower whatever cheesiness you may get. Meh.    The ginger ale took multiple waitresses to get, and wasn't brought until about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. It was just sitting at the end of the bar, taunting us. We were one of maybe 3 couples in the entire restaurant, and it was a chore to get their attention, and each time they actually came to the table to give us our order, they immediately turned around without asking if there was anything else, which caused the perpetual game waving our hands around hoping someone else would see us. More on the ginger ale later.   The waffle was enormous and my boyfriend said it was quite good, however it was very, very dry. When we finally got the attention of our waitress again (who was busy cleaning the restaurant. The entire time.) we asked for some syrup. We received about two tablespoons and they had the gall to charge us 50 or 75 cents (can't remember the exact price but I'm still shocked) for more syrup?! When they barely put any on in the first place?! Ridiculous.   My Reuben was okay but nothing to write home about. Portions were decently sized, but majorly overpriced by $2-4. The manager did eventually come over once they realized that our mac & cheese balls never came and apologized for the wait. When she asked if there was anything else, I asked for a refill on the ginger ale and she said there were no refills on drinks, but she would refill as a gesture. She brought out the can and - omg. Literally a tiny half-can of ginger ale. For $3. Half the glass is ice. What a ripoff.   This restaurant really reminded me a lot of NYC eateries without any of the charm or service. Overpriced, under-seasoned, and trying to get every last cent out of you they can while ignoring their customers. I really love going to local restaurants, but this is one I do not think I would come back to. Only giving it an extra star because it has late-night hours and an expansive and fully vegan menu, but there are so many other options on this side of town that will give us great service, great food, and at reasonable prices.",

I love the creative menu at TMV, it's 100% plant based, though not 100% healthy, but I'm ok with occasionally indulge myself and have some fried and savory food on weekends and save the salad bowl for weekdays. I had green curry with soy \"chicken\" and a lot of veggies and it was really good! The service was lacking and I had to wait a while for them to take my order, refill my water and collect my credit card... maybe it's better outside the busy lunch hour.",

Nutty and creamy and a tiny hint of spice in the background to bring to together. I considered ordering a second side to-go, and I regret never doing so to this day!  The chicken and waffles were...interesting. The waffle was everything a waffle should be. Crusty on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Not too overdone but not gummy either. Juuuust right! The chicken tho, it was just too much! I don't hate seitan, but a fat hunk of fried seitan with no other buffer but a waffle was overwhelming. I just kept chewing, and chewing and chewing and chewing, with some hot sauce of course! No way I'd be able to eat all that with no other outstanding flavors. I think it would've been better as chicken strips.   The potatoes underneath were sweet! An unpleasant surprise. Savory potatoes would've been the PERFECT complement the seitan needed, but that mark was missed.   The sweet potatoes, and the sweet waffle and the fried but otherwise flavorless seitan was off balance...That mac and cheese tho!  My sister raved about her biscuits and gravy.",

They have over 100 items, basically anything you're craving. They have. My service has always been amazing here as well.   But the real reason I came here to brag, one night I went there at 250 am thinking they were open until 5 and hadn't realized the hours changed to closing at 3! They must have been having a slow night and closed a little early.  The server recognized me as a usual, unlocked the doors, the chef came out and took my order himself and set it to go.   You can't beat that kind of service.   Thank you modern vegan",

When you open the door and walk in the ambiance shifts to what reminded me of this place called \"LIME\" in SF. Pretty much a daytime club. The first time we went, was in the morning. The music is loud and the portions are large. We shared, Breakfast Potato Skins, I ordered the Lobster Roll and bf got the Chik'n & Waffles. All of which were amazing! No to-go box needed. The service was okay, the server seemed to be new at serving but no complaints.  The second time we came was during their first late night service hours. We pulled up around 2am. The late night menu is a shorter version of the main menu but still plenty of options to choose from. This time I got the jerk sandwich and he got the reuben. Again, amazing...and unbelievably vegan. No box needed again! The owner asked us how everything was during this visit and it was mighty delicious! Will definitely be back more often.",

    "text": "Another great vegan spot off the strip. Unlike some of the others, though, this one is actually relatively close by. It's located adjacent to the University of Nevada campus, probably a 10 min taxi or ridehail trip from the strip.   When you walk into the restaurant, you immediately get the whole \"modern\" part of their name. The inside is very monochromatic; that is, most of the furniture and decor is bright white, with some black accents here and there. At a quick glance, you could almost think the restaurant was on the higher end of things. But once doing a deeper look, the types of plain tables, setup, and (of course) menu items steers you back to the reality: MDV offers comfort food, plain and simple.  And they sure do offer a lot of it. Their menu is a massive, over-sized one pager. A huge portion of it is devoted to breakfast items alone (which can be ordered any time of the day), with the rest being a mix of mostly normal lunch and dinner offerings, desserts, etc.  On my last trip to Vegas, I actually ate here twice. First, yes, it was that good. But second, it was on my way back to the airport and I wanted something easy to carry onto the plane with me.   On the first visit, my co-worker and I shared an order of corn dogs, and I got the reuben for my main. The corn dogs were out of this world. They were definitely more than your standard store-bought variety, not that there's necessarily anything wrong those. But the batter on MDV's Corn Dog was the best I've had yet. Not only that, quite rightfully (but sadly, not commonly elsewhere) they had mayo, ketchup, and mustard on the side.  As for the reuben, it was certainly up there in the rankings of reubens I've had. The texture and construction was really on point, and it tasted exactly how I hoped.   The next day, I got a club sandwich, which was equally good and really massive. Even after transporting it a little to the airport, it was still quite intact and not a mess (as can often happen with a poorly made sandwich).  I must also say that the staff I interacted with both days were extremely nice. The waitress on the first night had a lot of great recommendations, and frequently checked in on us to ensure we had everything we needed. The following day, the guy behind the bar (who was assisting with take away orders) was generally very friendly, and had a nice large glass of water poured for me while I waited (a simple, but nice touch).  With a menu that size, I'm definitely looking forward to trying some more options next time I'm in town.",

The menu was quite extensive. There was a lot going on and a lot of items to pick from. This was both a good and a bad thing for me. It was a good thing because often there aren't many vegan choices on the menu. This was a bad thing because I'm indecisive and it made picking something much harder.   Our server was friendly, taking the time to explain the menu. In addition to the menu there is also a bar.   We settled on burgers and sandwiches. The cowboy burger was amazing. It was a burger with bbq sauce, bacon, and grilled onions, all vegan of course.   Price point is about $17 a plate. This is good quality vegan food so that price is what I would have expected.   It's a bummer that this place isn't closer to where I live. I'll definitely be back to try other menu items.",

On a Sunday afternoon, this was the hot spot to hit up for a late lunch/brunch with visiting friends. The ambiance and environment is super modern and contemporary with hints of black and white all around. It's a step up from a diner or quick-eat restaurant. There's a comfortable feel while also feeling trendy and hip.  We tried the corn dogs and queso for appetizers which were super delicious! The corn dogs were light and fluffy and the in-house-made \"mayo\" was a perfect compliment! The queso has just the tiny kick to it with corn chips on the side. My husband has the chicken and waffles which took some time since it was the most popular item in the joint but it was well worth it! The syrup wasn't overly sweet and the crispy \"chicken\" fit well with the fluffy waffle. I had the veggie Benedict which came home with me! The portion was very generous and filling! The mashed potatoes went really well with the spicy coconut \"hollandaise\" sauce and veggies. Our friends enjoyed their Reuben and the breakfast combo!   We will definitely be back because it's the business - just knowing it's super popular so there's always a wait during peak days and times!",

    "text": "Damn. I REALLY wanted to get behind this place because I love when new vegan joints open up here and I want to love them and support them but unfortunately they kind of missed the mark. I've tried this place out twice now and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be returning.  The first time we came we tried the Frenchie, V'eggs Benedict and a side of their Baked Mac n Cheese.  Hunnie Bunnie liked her French toast and the mac n cheese was pretty good - they make their own cheese sauce and it's very CHEESE-LIKE and SAUCY! But the V'eggs Benedict was DRENCHED in sauce, I had to scrape most of it off and the dish itself was rather flavorless.  The second time we came we tried several items: Spaghetti and Meatballs: Not enough sauce or flavor.  Eggplant Bolognese: Not enough sauce or flavor either.  Buffalo Chick'n sandwich: This was pretty freakin good, but honestly what isn't when it's drenched in a delicious sauce?  Popcorn chicken appetizer: These were pretty good as well, they tasted like actual popcorn chicken.  Mashed potatoes: Barely warm and no flavor.  Onion rings: The breading wouldn't stay on to save its' life and there was ZERO flavor. It does come with a dipping sauce but it should have good flavor WITHOUT the sauce.  I had also asked for a side of cheese sauce because I wanted to dip my fries in it when I got my sandwich but they brought it out with the popcorn chicken.   They brought the appetizer out first WITH my cheese sauce which I thought was odd because I wanted the cheese sauce to dip my fries in when I got my sandwich.  And after that the rest of the food kind of trickled out. The mashed potatoes side. And then the two pasta dishes a little later and then the onion rings and then finally my sandwich - it dragged because the server thought I ordered something else.  I really wish I could have ranted and raved about how amazing this place is. The menu is huge and looks like it has great potential but the food is expensive and flavorless. Chep said it was \"The worst food he's had in Las Vegas in ten years.\" I wouldn't say that, but it wasn't GOOD.",

Out of all the vegan places we've visited throughout the country, this place had an awesome variety of options to choose from! We were there for happy-hour and got bottomless mimosas! The bartender/waiter Scott was awesome and personable and he just kept bringing out the drinks and he made personalized surprise drinks, which were amazing! He recommended his favorites (which we decided to order) and it was delicious (Fish Tacos, Cowboy Burger). Excellent customer service and definitely recommend if you're in town!",

For my cocktail, I got the blue Hawaiian which was fairly large for it's price. For my appetizer, I got the Canadian poutine and I ate every ounce of it - the gravy on top was to die for! Then for my breakfast, I got the V'eggs Benny... the meal itself was amazing except I definitely could have gone without the hollandaise sauce due to it having a heavy and weird flavor palate. Other than the sauce, the place and atmosphere itself was amazing!! Would definitely recommend.",

I had to ask for silverware, extra napkins and my coffee was never refilled.  I work in the service industry, so I try to be pretty forgiving, but the restaurant wasn't crowded, so there really wasn't an excuse for the lack of service.  Thus this is why I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5.   Food is a 5 Service 3.5  Will I go back? Yes, because their menu is so extensive, I really have more items I'd love to try on my next visit.    Hopefully I will be able to update my review to 5 stars with better service on my next visit.",

    "text": "I drove from Los Angeles to try this restaurant. The pictures on IG and yelp looks amazing, but unfortunately this was a waste of time and money.  I arrived with my family at 8:30 pm 3/30/19, before we could all get in the door the server Lindsey, said they close in 30 min. We said that was fine. She then said \"ok just letting you know because at 9 you would have to get out\" we then said ok, then she insisted again \"I just have to let you know because i don't know if that's enough time to eat\" I then said \"it seems like you don't want to serve us\" she then acted like that wasn't the case.  After being seated we were handed the very limited Tuesday menu. We ordered our food and were not asked anything about drinks. Minutes later 2 dishes were brought out, 10 min after that 2 more dishes 10 min after that the final 3 dishes. It wasn't until we asked if they had drinks she rudely responded with \"yes I have you give you guys water\" without offering any other option until we asked.  The food was obviously nothing like the photos and poorly tossed together. The inside of the burrito was not warm, the sauce on top was cold like it was just grabbed out the fridge ((the burrito/sauce is served over paper that gets soggy and rips so try not to eat the paper)), French toast had barely any syrup, the strawberry served with one of the dishes was old, and the one of the dishes was very salty, but we didn't complain.  My son went to ask Lindsey for some more syrup but before he could even get within a 5 ft radius of her she pointed to the restroom and said \"restroom is over there\".  I've never had such awful customer service. And on top of it she had the nerve to add her own gratuity. I would not suggest anyone come here.",

I got the \"What Happens in Vegas\" which includes vegan eggs, asparagus, vegan sausage, vegan bacon and a piece of toast. I ordered it to-go and it was ready in about 10 minutes! Everything was DELICIOUS! I couldn't eat the toast because I'm Gluten-Free & i don't believe they have gluten free options (at least not that i saw on the menu), but this was the best vegan breakfast I've had in Vegas so far! The sausage smelled a little bit like beggin strips, but tasted just like real meat lol I highly recommend for vegans as well as curious meat eaters :)",

    "text": "I'm really not trying to leave a bad review so no one goes back there. I really hope that my honest feedback helps this Vegan Restaurant because there's not a lot of vegan places out in Vegas so I would love for this place to strive. So I came here for my first time with my my boyfriend on Saturday morning. We ordered some Waffles, Cauliflower wings, and a Gyro. My boyfriend is from Greece and he enjoyed a traditional gyro that taste so similar to the ones back at home! That was a ! The waffles were good but would be better if they came out warm not room temperature. And the Wings were the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! Another !  We got so excited about our amazing experience on Saturday, we wanted to return again the next day! Then it went down hill from there on Sunday. We decided to order corn dogs and cauliflower wings this time. The corn dogs came out first. As we bit into them, we both noticed the inside was uncooked! My boyfriend scooped out raw batter! We checked 3 out of 4 hot dogs and they were all like that. So we had them sent back and didn't want new ones anymore. When our wings came out, similar issue. The batter wasn't cooked all the way and we couldn't eat them fully, we had to pick off the raw breading and just eat the cauliflower my guess is the cook was OVER battering the food and it wasn't able to cook all the way throughly. The outside looked cooked but that wasn't the case inside. We kindly let the waitress know after we were done just to give the cooks a heads up about the inside being a lil raw, just so they're aware and wouldn't serve it like that to everyone else. We didn't demand our money back or a discount. Things happen and there was obviously different cook from the day before. We noticed that the cook argued with the waitress instead of taking honest feedback about the food. That was really unprofessional and we were just trying to help. Overall the service is amazing and the place has a cool vibe to it, but I think the food is really going to depend on who's cooking it that day. I have to give it a 2 star though because I left the restaurant not feeling well, and later threw up the batter from the wings!  The raw batter obliviously didn't sit well in my stomach and that was the only thing I ate that day and I didn't drink I only had water.",

    "text": "The food is fantastic but their service is hit or miss.   Let me say that I have both eaten in the restaurant and ordered delivery.   My first tip for you is to not order delivery from grubhub (sorry yelp). Long story short but I had a horror story one evening in which I placed an order 3 times, was on the phone with yelp support twice, was on yelp support online twice, and still never received my order. I then ordered from Postmates and received the wrong order (this is about 2 -3 hours later).   I ended up speaking to the manager of the restaurant and she said that they were having issues on and off with yelp orders not going through correctly (both pickup and delivery) and that they were working on fixing it.   Another issue I have with them is that they never answer their phone. Literally. Never.   That being said I have ordered from Postmates after that and gotten my order on time and everything was correct so just be aware if you are ordering delivery.   Now let's get onto the food.   Their portion sizes are massive and the chicken and waffles can easily feed two people. I have had their burgers, sandwiches, salads, and obviously they're famous chicken and waffles and I have not been disappointed with any of them. I've also tried their smoothies which are delicious but extremely overpriced so I would not recommend them ($10 for a tiny little cup of blended up banana and almond milk  - no thank you)   This place has great hours on the weekend as well so if you need some late-night munchies you don't have to stray from your vegan diet .. it was honestly probably one of the most exciting parts for me!  The parking is also pretty good. They have a decent size parking lot and I've never had an issue getting a spot although it can be a little seedy if you come late at night.  I eat here every time I come to Vegas and I won't be stopping anytime soon!!",

The jalapeno poppers were SPICY but very good if you can stand the heat. The onion rings were fantastic. The best item on the menu is the French toast. Trust me. Covered in berries it's a feast for the eyes as well as the tummy.  The service was a little slow (although as I said it took us a long time to order) so be aware if you're in a rush.",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I'm so not vegan. But I do stick to a meatless menu plan a couple days a week and have made several visits here over the past couple months trying a little bit of everything. I like what TMV offers for those with specialized diets, but those assuming \"vegan\" is synonymous with \"healthy\" will likely be overwhelmed by the massive menu that largely covers all the cheat meal bases from nachos and poutine to burgers and tacos. Luckily, they still have juices, smoothies, salads, and sandwiches for those wanting lighter options.  HITS: The Mexicana breakfast tacos are huge and tasty portion with three overflowing tacos. The cauliflower buffalo \"wings\" are among the best I've tried in terms of texture and even reheated well the next day. The hearts of palm-based \"lobster\" roll was impressive, with a tart and tangy sauce and a huge portion (an ongoing theme). The baked mac and cheese sauce was creamier than other versions I've tried and I think I detected a hint of butternut squash? Their sauces overall are one of their strengths. From the burger category, I customized the Cowboy (featuring Beyond Meat products) and enjoyed it as much as a regular burger, and the pretzel bun held up better than other vegan versions I've had around town, would omit the \"bacon\" next time.  SERVICE:  I've sat at the high top tables at the bar for all visits and usually get Anthony as my server, and have yet to encounter any of the service issues mentioned in other reviews. He's attentive and personable and I appreciate that I get my check taken care of quickly when I'm on limited time. Reading the snarky owner responses to low reviews is a turn off but I have only encountered positive vibes on site.   SUGGESTIONS: Portions are enormous which make the $10-15/dish prices reasonable but some of the apps are large enough to be meals in themselves, which could be adjusted or offered as half portions with lower pricing. Though I liked the tacos, the tortillas themselves didn't hold up well and their waffles are huge and dense.   Overall, I think they could pare down the menu a bit to improve quality. I appreciate that they offer so much but by now there's bound to be stuff that doesn't perform well or simply doesn't get ordered often. I am looking forward to bringing some vegan friends here who have just moved to Vegas- next I plan to try the loaded queso and the fish tacos!",

I've been vegan for about 8 months and it taste so much like if I was eating real bacon inside my Sandwich! Flavor was amazing and the sauce or spread was amazing! French fries were also really good and the sauce they offered me on the side was also amazing! Think it's called the TMV sauce but not too sure! Also ordered a Berry, peanut butter and chocolate smoothie! Also did not disappoint! Place closes at 11pm and people were still coming in until the very last minute! I will definitely be sure to come here every time I visit Las Vegas again!!!",

I gotta say, just reviewing the food alone IT WAS AMAZING! everything that I ordered was off the charts delicious. Decided to get the mac and cheese, the poutine fries and the San Diego salad. Everything was amazing delicious and didn't taste vegan at all. So flavorful, seasoned perfectly and such huge portions. If I wasn't so hungry, I think I could've made it last 2 servings. It was a little more than I was hoping to spend on the first meal here, but again it's Vegas, it was huge portions and why the f not?  On my way back to LA, I'm definitely planning on going back one more time and taking some with me. Absolutely in love with the modern vegan, anybody who comes to Vegas, I think even if you're not vegan wouldn't be disappointed with this place, it's just that good.",

    "text": "Writing an update since last year.   I'm happy to see they started opening on Monday for a Raw Vegan food day but my friend and I were both really disappointed.   What I can say though, is their burgers are great and their mac and cheese were good too. Hopefully, their gluten-free options are spruced up   I got the quinoa bowl and it was bland. It was made up of cabbage, carrot, mushroom, avocado, and quinoa. This seemed great and looked beautiful when brought out but the flavor was completely lacking. I would think maybe it is a one-off but I had gotten their avocado caprese which was just ok and also their pesto soup which, again, completely lacking in any memorable flavor. I'm writing this in hopes that management and staff will reassess their menu because this will be a BIG turn off to people and tbh, speaking for 2 vegans, 1 being Raw 1/3 of each year, we were both surprised at how this was coming out of the kitchen. We were really excited to come this day because not many places in Vegas have raw foods option and were left scratching our heads at how the ball could have been dropped on this. Hope this gets passed as a constructive critique and not a blast on the restaurant - really easy to add some flavors. I've been here 3 times and only once was it something I would want to come back for (the burger and mac and cheese). This will most likely not compete well in Cali. It just seems like any gluten-free option is not going to be good and I'm not sure why.",

HOWEVER, Our only complaint was the service we received from the tall gentlemen at the bar with dreads who resembled a model. He didn't bring our drinks out until the food was about to be plated, I asked for ranch and he forgot and gave other customers multiple sauces. Additionally, he didn't ask if the food was good and offered dessert after handing us our bill. Honestly in the future I would rather get the food To go, if customer service isn't placed as a top priority.",

Plus the staff is kind and they are helpful in suggesting great menu selections. They've only been open a few weeks, and I hope they continue to thrive so I can go again the next time in Vegas.   Between my boyfriend and I, we had the Pulled Pork sandwich on a pretzel bun, the buffalo chicken sandwich, the BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato sandwich), and a dessert. Everything was good!",

Coming from LA VEGAN FOOD this place blew  too expensive not at all worth the price.  I had the chick'n and waffles, the mashed potatoes were good, but overall the waffles and chick'n was flavorless.  My boyfriend and brother ordered the great American. Using the beyond patty I didn't think they could go wrong, but they did the bun had no taste. Presentation was great but as far as taste, if it wasn't for the BEYOND patty it would be a zero.  For appetizers we got jalapeno poppers and Mac n cheese. Jalapeno poppers were really good   Mac n cheese again missing something not good at all.  I gave this place a 2 because of their food and prices. Overall total paid was $71 not including tip.  Coming from LA and vegan for 3yrs. I do not recommend and if you do try it coming from LA it was more expensive then VEGGIE GRILL, and SAGE BISTRO.   In my opinion, if I ever went back to Las Vegas I will NOT be returning to MODERN VEGAN.  PICTURES ARE deceiving",

Went yesterday and had a new server names Moe. This guy was awesome. If I ever had a complaint with TMV it would be that sometimes I'm unhappy with the service or care from employees at times, but Moe absolutely crushed it.",

Of course everything isn't going to be fast on the first day!   Everyone was kind and sweet, the restaurant was packed, and most importantly / the food was BOMB! Everything tasted delicious which is the most important thing!   Don't come to a brand new place in the first week if you're in a massive rush. Maybe come back a little later in the month. The food is for sure worth the wait and you will enjoy it more when you have time to be patient!   I think today was amazing. The food was great. The restaurant is clean and tidy and the food speaks for itself!   Update: May 2018 Came back with a friend for a late lunch, ordered 4 things, all absolutely amazing!!!!!! Breakfast potato skins / delish! Louisiana fried chicken, outstanding! Fish tacos - legitimately tasted just like regular fish tacos (but no death!) and finally the grilled cheese - ORDER IT NOW!!!!!!",

    "text": "I've been waiting to go to TMV since it opened, but figured I'd wait a bit so it wouldn't be as busy as opening week. My fiance and I came around 6pm post-gym and very hungry, so we went all out!   Cosmopolitan smoothie: really liked it, was smooth consistency and had good flavors. Didn't overpower our meal.  Truffle Mushroom soup: had really good flavor, but the consistency wasn't creamy enough. Did not taste any truffle flavor. Just call it mushroom soup and I would still eat it.  Side of mac & cheese: slightly bland, missing a bit of salt. It has potential though. There were some vegan bacon bits in there which gave it good texture.  The Buffalo burger w/fries: the tastiest vegan burger according to my fiance. It had a good buffalo flavor, but it didn't overpower the sandwich. The avocado was a nice touch. He asked for ranch on the side which made it super tasty. Fries a little under salted, but the crispiness was good.  The Rancho w/salad: Definitely bit off more than I could chew with this one. Didn't realize it came with a double chick'n patty, but I ended up taking the second one home. The patty is super crunchy and tasty, and as a whole that burger was delicious! I like that they used spinach for the salad. I got the dressing on the side.  The service: We were seated right away and the restaurant still had a decent amount of people at their tables. Our server Missy was very nice and helped me pinpoint which burger to get. It looked like the place was pretty busy and only 3 servers I think? Either way, there was always someone to refill our waters and check on us to make sure we were okay or if we needed anything.   The price: A bit pricey, but tasty and worth it to go once in a while for a nice meal. The quality is on point.  We will be back to try the breakfast items next time!",

It was certainly disappointing as I'd hope to get a break from the normal vibe of this town.

    "text": "The Food Presentation: I saw pictures of the food on the website I ordered the \"What Happens in Vegas\", based on the lovely photo , I was expecting a healthy bushel of asparagus (~7 pieces), hearty chunks of tofu in the scramble, 1/2 a plate full of the potatoes seasoned with an abundance of basil, a hearty portion of the vegan bacon, and vegan sausage. When my plate arrived, my partner and I could not hold in our laughter.  See my picture. The plate had two scrawny, shriveled pieces of asparagus, a fried mess of crumbs posing as the tofu scramble, and potatoes covering 1/4 of the plate with just a dash of basil, and 2 extremely oily pieces of vegan bacon. The vegan sausage was the only thing on the plate that looked like the advertised picture.  The items were spread on the plate in a manner that screamed \"we ran out of food and are trying our best to make it appear as though we did not\".    The Food Taste: Underwhelming.  The tofu scramble had a crumb consistency and lacked any distinguishable flavor.  It was hard to get over the crumb-like consistency.  You could not stab it with your fork like a real tofu scramble because it was too crumby.  The crumbs rolled off the fork.  The only way to get it into your mouth was to shovel it in quickly like a starving person.  Even then, some crumbs escaped to the floor.  The asparagus was bland.  The potatoes were okay but did not have anything that stood out about it.  The vegan bacon was just oily.  The only thing that was good was the vegan sausage.  My partner got the breakfast burrito, which was primarily ice-burg lettuce and onions.  The onions over-powered the dish.  A burrito from Chipotle customized to vegan would have tasted much better (and had more nutritious lettuce) for less than half the price. Also, the coffee was not the best (watery, gas station grade coffee).    The Service:  We waited well over 1 hour for our food.  The waiter was quick to put in our order and bring us coffee, however, he did not check on us again until about 45 minutes later to tell us that our food was almost ready.  He also did not provide a coffee refill until that point.  I wasn't actually sure if our waiter was supposed to be our waiter.  I somehow thought he was the bartender who stepped in real quick because everyone else was busy.  Then we got ignored for a good 45 minutes.  It did give ample time to observe the staff and see the mini-dramas occurring amongst the employees.  Given, they were probably stressed that they were running out of food or something and had to spread the plates thin.  There seemed to be mini-meetings/scolding's between the gal that appeared to be the owner and the employees.  The atmosphere seemed extremely tense. Unprofessional.    The Price: The \"What Happens in Vegas\" and breakfast burrito were each $15.  Compared that to VegeNation that offers a Tofu Scramble and Vegan Burrito for $11.95 each, I would call the Modern Vegan not much value for your buck.  Also, given the taste factor, remember you can get a Chipotle burrito that is customized Vegan for just $6.50.  The Ambiance:  Average. Looks like it was a 7-11 or night club converted into a restaurant (based on the location and tinted black windows). Some good ideas, but still had a run-of-the-mill Ikea feel to it.   I was excited to try this place, but the overall food quality, taste, service, and price were lacking.  Especially since I tried VegeNation the day before (which was excellent) and had a direct comparison.",

    "text": "To get to the point of why 2 stars: Service- the server couldn't make a recommendation which is part of her job; our food came out late and way after other people who were seated after us got there food.  Menu- the kitchen was backed up and can't seem to handle such a large menu Food- lobster sandwich was possibly made with heart of palm that was way too salty. Corn dogs were actually really really good! So were our alcoholic becer Portion and price- too big and too high; appetizers such as corn dogs come too big (4 whole corn dogs). They should cut the price and the portion so people can afford the food and be able to try more without getting stuffed. Overall, the prices on the menu are too expensive for the experience and the location which is not the safest area and a bit run down.   TMV is new and maybe with a little time they will improve, I hope. Great items on the menu I would look forward to trying in 6months when I give them another chance.   Update 5/26 visit ( won't go again)  This food was delicious but the service; here is my feedback: we were the first ones there in the morning when they opened. the skillet came out 12 minutes before the waffle. One waitress came by and said it was because the food is made to order and we only have one waffle iron. The next server blamed it on \"new cooks\". Why can no one take ownership for the issue? My silverware was placed on a dirty silicone mat when they took my skillet away to keep it warm. I asked for new silverware and they asked me why? Gross! You know I had a very bad experience but I had no \"Service recovery\". Nothing was comped on my bill. This is the second time I tried eating there and I won't be back again. I hope that they hire a front of the house manager who can actually run a restaurant. They got the food but they cannot execute.",

    "text": "I'm coming in Sunday with my non vegan, fiance and sister in law. And while browsing the menu pictures I noticed some pictures of less then stellar reviews, coupled with a response from the manager. Which of course led me to read other reviews. Which lead me to actually posting something.   I tried this place spontaneously one morning after a few errands I ran on campus at UNLV. It's great that I could practically hop a fence and get to a vegan joint for lunch or breakfast. Who cares about the strip mall, this is Vegas. Embrace some diversity.  But more to the point. I came in around 10am, and they weren't too busy. The hostess was nice. The decor was clean, white and simple. But had some very nice touches. Hey the furniture may come from ikea, but so does my mattress and I love it.   My server was attentive, refilled my water glass a few times, I sorely needed it. Room temperature water is actually absorbed better by your digestive system. This is a desert. (Summer is coming TMV, larger water glasses might be a good idea).   I had chk'n and waffles. Which I've only had a few times in the last decade. They were good. I might have preferred the breading slightly less crispy, but wasn't a deal breaker. The waffle, was good. The mashed potatoes were delicious. I wanted more syrup.. but then I wanted gravely too. I asked for neither and wasn't unsatisfied. Nearly finished the double size portion.   I did ask for recommendations from the server. I wanted a sandwich to go. I ride a motorcycle so space is limited and as I usually pack a lunch in the same size container. I needed something that would fit. I really wanted to try everything, last on my list was the Rueben. I've actually never had the meat version. (15 yrs vegan). But this is what he recommended, though he couldn't see it fitting in my tubberware. It did, and I told him to hold the fries when I ordered. I would have liked the option to get the sandwich al carte, but ended up just telling him to save that order of fries for himself. The Ruben was delicious, half of it was lunch and I came home and threw the other half in the oven for dinner. Just as good.   It's a bit pricey, I could make similar items at home for about the same cost, with more servings...but do you know how nice it is to have so many options? And people will cook it for you, craft the details, do your dishes and serve you. It's a rare experience in my book. Yes over tried nearly every vegan joint in town. I like Violets, but it's way too far away from where I live and work.   I could see a lighter portions option being a big hit, or a order to go menu designed for the broke college student. Maybe in the future? Just thoughts.   Gia, you've done a fantastic job. This is truly a Vegas Vegan restaurant. Thank you.   As a note. I gave this 5 stars. I work in food service, so maybe I have a more realistic approach to expectations. But just because I don't particularly like or agree with something doesn't mean it isn't good or relevant.",

    "text": "The food is really good. Very good!!!  Unfortunately, the times I've gone they're out of half the menu items. And to make matters worse, you're not told they're out til you've already placed your order. This is a common problem for restaurants that have a big menu. I think that's the case with TMV - they haven't learned to manage their inventory because it's too large. They probably need to pair it down a bit. (They should, however, inform customers right when they're seated rather than after they order.)  Today we were told the issue was that 'the waffle iron broke.' Weird, right? Because a restaurant should have more than one. And you can just go buy another one real quick at Target around the corner. Because it's Fathers' Day weekend and likely to be kind of busy for brunch. (Just for the record, they were also out of vanilla ice cream and other items too.)  I want this place to work. They just need to figure out this issue and stop disappointing people.",

The vegan tacos are just your regular bagged tortillas, barely warmed up, filled with tofu and potatoes. No salsa to accompany them. I've also tried their Asian noodles, which again, lacked flavor, very disappointed. Most dishes average around $15 - $17 , definitely not worth it. Service is ok, so 3 stars for that.",

I think we just beat the rush, as we were eating there were mobs of people waiting outside.  5 tables were reserved when we arrived and 4 of them remained reserved during our entire time there (which was about 1.5 hours). Either they reserve them really early or don't cancel reservations when they're too late. Unfortunate, since it looks like they lost business due to wait times being too long.  Food came out pretty fast (like \"no way that could have all been made to order that fast\" fast). I had the chicken and waffles because they were out of the benedicts. It was huge, and tasty...but really cold. Looks like other people had the same issue with that dish.   Ordered the cheesecake trio to-go. This and the cheque took a long time.   I am sure the kinks will work out and they will get better. Everyone was really nice and kept apologizing for the way things were going in general.",

    "text": "Let's start with the good: the menu. It is HUGE. HUUUUUGE. There are a ton of awesome items on it. This place was extremely hyped up prior to opening, largely in thanks to the local vegans website, \"Vegans, Baby.\" Now, on to the \"meh\" / bad. I stayed away for quite a few weeks because of the owner's behavior on social media. I saw multiple instances where she was being incredibly rude to potential customers, including arguing on her business page regarding the \"right\" way to create a menu item. It really disgusted me and made me not want to become a patron. However, I did come to try it out. Starting with location: it's close to UNLV, which is great for vegan students, but in a very unsavory part of town. The windows are completely blacked out from the outside as well, which makes you wonder if they're even open. After parking and taking our valuables with us (haha) we went inside. The hostess was on her phone, which was a bit of a turnoff - I completely understand boredom at work, but at least fold silverware or something. The interior itself is pretty nice and looks like it'd be cool for brunch/happy hour (if they had that; they're only open until 6pm at present). They have bumping club/rap music which also confused me - if they were open late I'd get it, but during lunchtime it created an odd ambiance.  The waitstaff seemed generally under-trained and very confused when taking orders. One of the food runners had to be asked four times for hot sauce; he continuously brought us ranch and ketchup until we gave up and waited for our waitress to return. I think the waitstaff has potential to be good, they just need A LOT more practice. Two of us ordered a gyro, the other three ordered various salads. The portions here are HUGE and honestly could feed two people per entree. I would highly advise they size down their menu items and decrease price as it's just not realistic. As far as the gyro, it was good, but not great. It was thick, fluffy bread as large as my face - which really made me wonder whether the owners had ever had a real gyro. The massive side of the bread made it really hard to enjoy the interior, which essentially fell everywhere and couldn't be contained by this half of a bread loaf. The salads were all pretty good, no complaints there. Payment also took some time as the waitress seemed confused as to how to use her portable POS machine. Overall I'm glad I went, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. I hope that they will begin to offer carry out or Postmates/Uber Eats as I'd prefer that over eating in.",

We went there on Saturday for brunch as we couldn't find anything healthy to eat on the strip. It was a $6 Uber ride and we're so glad we went there even though it's not in the prettiest part of town, but safe especially as there were many young families too.  It's a very simple and clean venue in a small strip mall. The food was fabulous. I enjoy large portions and I was very pleased as I left quite full. They've only been open for about 6 months and you can tell they've come a long way.  Even with the place being packed the service was excellent and friendly. I would highly recommend TMV. I can't wait to go back and try other menu choices.",

Went the third and maybe the last time and got sat at the bar. This experience was the worst, our server, I think his name is Steffon, was pretty rude right from the beginning, why? I don't know, we're always pretty nice. My bf ordered a burrito with chicken, a few minutes later our server came and told us that \"the kitchen messed up the order and put the meat crumbles instead of the chicken if you want to send it back your order will take 15 min\" um what? Why didn't you just have them redo it as the customer wanted it, at least be nice about it but my bf accepted since we didn't want to wait 15 min. Food was alright, the breakfast burrito was cold. My bf never complains but today was the first time I heard him say something bad about service and food. When we finished, our server gave us our check very rudely. Good thing my bf paid and left a tip because I wouldn't have. I really hope TMV can better their service. Otherwise people will start to notice and not come. Again, I really wanted to like this place but after this service I don't think we will.",

Not sure how I feel about the branding it looks like Mayweather's Money Team and the atmosphere feels like a nightclub which is cool but also can feel a bit sterile but hey also gives it a clean feeling which is rare for this area. Besides all that the staff was helpful and honest about the menu. The menu was a bit overwhelming so many options maybe condensing the menus to separate breakfast lunch and dinner menus would be helpful, awesome that they do have so many options though ! That being said a lot of the items on the menu weren't available like they only serve one soup per day and they didn't have the cheese for Mac n cheese and nachos etc... ok whatever plenty of other options. So we ordered the corn dogs for appetizer surprisingly nom and I had the Snob because I'm a snob for portobello mushrooms and not a fan of beyond meat and soy this soy that wheat this wheat that... it's great there are vegan options but I think it's lazy to use premade products come up with some original plant based meat subs to get 5 stars from me... it's all about the jackfruit and less soy and wheat products because that's the cheap and easy route .... anyway that's just my preference ... the pretzel bun was bomb the snob burger was bomb I loved the cheese on it and prefer it over Skinny Fats port sandwich... my friend ordered the spaghetti which she really enjoyed... over all I like this place and it's good place to take your non vegan friends who are interested in trying meat subs... this place has potential the foods already bomb not healthy but tasty",

    "text": "My one of many fave vegan restaurants in Vegas! Very brand new and well awaited to try. I didn't want to rush and visit within the first week-month knowing it would be packed. So I visited at just the right time and experienced no wait time and seated immediately. First let me just say, from the jump the ambiance and style of the restaurant alone is very appealing to the eye. Hence the name \"Modern\" Vegan! Totally suits the restaurant perfectly. My waiter was completely knowledgeable about the menu, made a few suggestions, and explained each dish down to the seasonings! Buffalo cauliflower seems to be my go-to at every vegan restaurant even non-vegan places. So I decided to automatically try their twist on it. As well as the lobster roll and I think my bff ordered fish tacos. Their menu by the way is out of this world! Super diverse with many options to choose from (entrees I didn't even know were possible of being made vegan) thanks to the owner and ceo of the restaurant; most items on the menu are recipes created from scratch by her! On top of everything, I truly give this place a 5 star rating due to their genuine customer service. They really care here. Customer service is everything to me. Wether you work in retail, hospitality, or the food & beverage industry it counts. I seem to have really bad luck with finding a piece of hair whenever I eat out. And unfortunately it did happen to me here. It happens to me so often that I stopped blaming where i ate at but started blaming myself! Lol thank goodness the manager came by and apologized and took really great care of us. She literally remade everything I ordered and gave a complimentary dessert. They went above and beyond! I appreciate her accountability and she's truly the sweetest soul I've ever met. They def have a returning customer right here, always!",

I can't remember all I ordered (since I visited about a month ago and forgot to write my review then), but I remember it all being super good and the next time I'm in Vegas I am going back here!",

    "text": "The modern vegan has such a great atmosphere and feels very homey. The staff is very welcoming from the minute you step foot in the front door until the time you leave. They treat you like you are part of the family and you never feel like just another customer. I always sit at the bar with my friend each time we come in usually at 3am from a good night out and it's the best way to end the night. We are always greeted by the very attractive and friendly bartender/server Scott. Scott always has a smile on his face. He is very attentive to what you need and is always on top of everything!! He is one of the best bartender/servers that I have met in a long time. We need more people like him. The food is amazing as well ! I am always craving those sweet potato fries! The service and staff are amazing! I recommend whoever is reading this to try it out as well vegan or not ! You won't regret it !",

    "text": "One star solely because they are Vegan. If you love salt, this is the place for you. All I could taste was salt. I ordered the Reuben, it tasted like a salt sandwich. My wife had the Fried Chicken.....that was \"Fried Salt.\" Look, I am from North Carolina, I am used to to a heavy dose of salt, but this southern boy had more than my heart could take, (literally) In all seriousness any place that has 4 and 1/2 stars on here should be leaps and bounds better than this place. I have been Vegan for 2 years and this is the worst Vegan restaurant I have ever eaten at. The prices were WAY to high for the amount of food that I received. My wife and I ordered the \"cheese\" cake trio for $13. I think the cheesecake came from the Kid's Menu, because I truly don't know what my money went to. Also, the cheese cake was supposed to be Strawberry, Blueberry, and Peanut Butter. What the menu neglects to tell you is that it is plain cheesecake with some fake tasting syrup, a dollop of Jiffy peanut butter, one strawberry sliced paper thin, and 3 blueberries. Look that is ok, but not for $13. Overall, I am sad. If a non-vegan ate here I would be afraid they would never go vegan. It does not represent our community well, and that is the worst part. Ownership, if your reading, you've lost a vegan with a large following. Customers, there are plenty of other great vegan restaurants in Vegas, go else where and save your self the drive/uber money. You'll be happy you did. Thanks.",

I recently went back and the vibe is totally different now. The service was really really bad. Like really bad. Just slow and they seemed like they didn't know what was going on with anything. However the food was still really good so that's a plus but I'm not sure what happened to their service",
