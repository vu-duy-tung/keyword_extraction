    "text": "OH EM GEE!!!!!!  I think this is currently my new favorite restaurant.  You don't hear much about this place but my friend brought me here for an early bday dinner and I loved it so much that for my actual bday dinner when my other girlfriends arrived in town, we came back!  I've had tapas before but this place was one of the best.  The portions are small but that's really what tapas are!  And it allows you the ability to try more and order more!  My favorites would be the carpaccio, the crab cake lettuce cups, the thai chicken flat bread, papardelle pasta, and holy SMORES PIZZA!! Honestly, that smores pizza is one of the best things I have ever eaten. I have no idea what they put in it - crack perhaps? - I could eat ten of those in one sitting, if I knew that it wouldn't all go straight to my butt.  Sooooooo good!  Drinks are a bit pricey.  They offer wine flights, selection of four wines in 2 oz glasses.  That was good, but still pricey.  Sangria was good too but wayyyyyy expensive!",

The ouside patio is beautiful with the surrounding pool and gardens.  We had some Prosecco and 3 tapas - bacon wrapped dates, some smoked salmon wonton thing, and stuffed chicken.  They were all quite tasty although the chicked was a bit dry.  Service was great.  I would love to go back and try some different items on their menu - the wine list looked very interesting as well.",

If we weren't on a schedule, this is the sort of environment I could hang out in sipping wine for hours.  The service was exceptional and the drinks delicious.  My friends got the blood orange margaritas and they were amazing - tons of flavor and not too sweet.  I had a white wine flight that was also very good, and reasonably priced at $15 for four 2 oz samples.  Oh, and the server explained the date on the plates to us - one was clearly the year they opened, and the other was 6,000 something B.C., which apparently is the first recorded date of wine.  Pretty awesome.",

We had a party of 8 in which she gave us several reccomendations of items to try along with our drink orders. She was so accomodating and nice, even when she forgot 2 items, it was ok, because she was that good and everything was perfect.  Wonderful cocktail selections along with the food. The carpaccio was absolutely delicious! Tender meat served with capers and herbs along with an aolii sauce.  The flatbreads had a wonderful combination of ingredients with the flavors bursting in your mouth.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.",

We asked for ketchup and tabasco sauce and again another waitress disappeared requiring us to ask for the third waitress. Our order for drinks took about 20-30 minutes to complete. Our plates were not clean and they walked by 3-4 times without the courtesy of changing them. When they replaced the plates, we can see leftover food on the new plates. My wife asked for a pancake and, again, the waiter disappeared but he came back with food to serve other table. We had to ask another waitress. The restaurant was not as busy as any other typical restaurant and they obviously were not short of staff.  Food: same burgers, sandwiches, pizza and tater-tots over and over again. The food is cheap american food you can get it at any fast food restaurant. The quality is equivalent to McDonald's. It costs $48.00 per person before tax and tips and you have to pay for your drinks separately plus NO refill. No water unless you ask for it. Waiters and waitresses were dropping their plates several times like it's normal.  I'm a Las Vegas resident with an average standard. If you want good food and decent service, you should NOT come here. We came here for Easter Brunch for butler service--all you can eat.",

There is a wine for all taste buds. We bought a bottle and ate on the patio overlooking the garden pool.  We ended up being there for 3 hours and were not rushed to leave.  The food is tapas style and very high quality.  We had the La Cave Cesear Salad which was yummy and the meat & cheese board.  Biting into the cheese you could tell it was real aged cheese, delicious!  After sitting there so long we decided to have the chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was divine.  If you enjoy high quality food and wine this is the place for you.",

The cozy, lounge like atmosphere made La Cave the perfect beginning to our last night in Vegas. To satisfy our greens craving we ordered the asparagus, egg and pancetta salad which was spot on! The quail egg, ham and cheese flatbread was super delish and had an unexpected, yet nice spice to it. The steak croquettes topped with blue cheese were also delish! What was that sauce? Yum! We also enjoyed a nice bottle of Malbec for $48. The service was great and our waiter was super accommodating. He even allowed us to hang out long after closing to finish our wine and enjoy the view off of the balcony. In the end, we spent about $120 (including tip) for two girls. Best and least expensive meal we had in Vegas. I would recommend calling to see if you can reserve a table outside on the balcony.",

    "text": "La Cave is a smaller Tapas joint hidden in the Wynn corridors. Part of its allure are the 3 different seating \"rooms\" the restaurant offers. Indoors for the person that wants an intimate, dark setting with chatter around. A covered patio type situation with wicker seating for the casual diners who want to have a more spacious experience. And of course, the tables completely outdoors that face the pool area.  Having had the opportunity to dine here for both a late-night dinner as well as an afternoon lunch, I was able to experience the entire restaurant. The hostesses and waitstaff here were very friendly and they even remembered me when I came back the next day. This is truly the most heartwarming restaurant - service wise- that I've been at the Wynn properties. Yes, most of the time service is impeccable in these resorts but this was the only place that I felt that the wait staff actually cared and weren't just carrying out directions.   The chef, Bill De Marco was there the entire time at dinner and I actually saw him inspecting all the food that left the kitchen. That to me, is a good sign (as I constantly mention in my reviews).   Once again, we had partaken in the vegan menu offered here (all priced between $10-$15):  1. Salt Roasted Beets, Vegan Cheese, Pistachios - The beets were cooked very well and sweet red juices were oozing out of every bite. The pistachios here really made the dish. Grated to the tiniest piece, they provided the uniquest crunch to the dish. I can only say that perhaps adding a few more pistachios might have made this dish more memorable  2. Mushroom Tortellini, Arugula, Tomato \"Cream\" Sauce - I was going insane at the plump juicy cherry tomatoes that topped the dish. Yumminess! The tortellini's were savory and the cream sauce was exquisite. Pieces of mushrooms mixed into the dish were also so satisfying. Served in a cast iron cup, the presentation was also eye-catching  3. Gardein \"Chicken\", Celery Root Puree, Lemon Caper Sauce -Yum Yum Yum. After we plowed through this, we wanted seconds. The protein was cooked amazingly. Crisp in the right places and moist in others. The concoction your fork made with some Gardein, the celery root puree, some of the spinach and sauce was just heavenly. Deliciousness.  We had blood orange margaritas that were rather potent and very tasty to round out the beverage portion of the night.   La Cave is a nice place for all events...date night, a nice weekend brunch or a rambunctious group dinner. And they have a menu for everyone. I like!",

Got seated right away in the back bar area (asked for patio area but it was booked or closed for another party)  After being seated it took almost 10-12minutes before anyone came to us and asked if we wanted something to drink.  Once we ordered waters and 2 cocktails, our beverages took another 10minutes or so to get to our table.   Once drinks were out of the way, we ordered our food.  My husband and I are big foodies, so usually we order a lot of things off the menu when we go out to eat.  The server knowing we ordered 7 plus different tapas dishes, they should have paced the food coming out to the table. I say that because we were seated on a small 2 top  table and there was very limited space to place all the dishes we ordered. I felt as if we had to hurry to eat what was on the table to make room for the next dish. Or they squeezed the next dish on the table. Trying to move our water and cocktail glasses here and there to make room. That kind of bugged me.   Food:  Not too much complaints there except the scallop dish we had was bit salty. Even my husband who likes salty food said it was too salty.  But it was cooked to perfect temperature.   Overall the food was pretty good. Service not so great.",

    "text": "As I was eating dinner at La Cave the other night, I was debating that this review could go anywhere from a 2 star to a 4 star.  We ate there with a group of 6, and since it is Tapas, we were able to try almost everything on the Menu.  Unfortunately, nothing was super memorable.  I'll start with the highlights.  1) Our server was very nice.  Great personality and even gave some good recommendations for offstrip restaurants. 2) The Beef Filet was quite was good.  That and the Charcuterie plate were probably the two best items that we had. 3) The wine selection was quite good.  The Sommelier acted of high importance, but didn't show any action for his promises.  As shown below.  The bad: 1) The restaurant is in the Wynn, and prices were as expected.  They were not outrageous, but for the quality of the food, they seemed a bit high. 2) As we were eating the duck, the Sommelier asked how the duck was.  I told him that it was chewy and not very good.  At first he acted surprised, and said he would take it off the bill.  As the norm, I said, \"oh no, that's ok\" (still expecting him to do it).  He then replied, \"other people have said they didn't like either.  I'm taking it off for you guys.\"  I figured if he DID stand behind that comment, that would def. bump La Cave up a star.  If he didn't, then it goes down a star because it was that bad. 3) Other disappointing dishes were the overcooked and small Scallops, the watery grits, and the chewy lamb.  La Cave is a 3 star restaurant for the mediocre food, and above average service for the strip.  All dishes were \"OK\" and nothing blew any of us away.  It was all just OK.  As you guessed, the duck remained on the bill, and as expected, the Sommelier was just giving us words.  I doubt I will be back to La Cave, and gladly try other restaurants in Vegas.",

    "text": "Our meal at La Cave in the Wynn hotel was by far the most outstanding dining experience we enjoyed during our extended weekend stay in the desert.  After a number of other meals and experiences which fell short on the execution, I thought that La Cave did everything very well.  Our server was prompt, friendly and informative.  There was never a push to hurry any decision which gave us plenty of time to look over the \"American tapas\" menu.  The cuisine is creative American, all served in small plates.  It took us some time to come up with right combo of tastes and sizes.  We agreed on 4 small plates - the rack of lamb chops, the pasta with broccolini, the mushroom grits and the 3 bean salad.  All of the dishes were excellent.  Of the 4, probably the salad and lamb were the biggest stand outs.  The salad because this wasn't your picnic variety of 3 bean salad.  Rather, the La Cave version had fresh green beans, fried garbanzo beans, grilled artichoke hearts in a delicious ice wine vinaigrette. Yum!  The lamb was served hot, juicy and tasting of the grill.  La Cave has an extensive wine list of bottles, glasses and 1/2 bottles - domestic and imports.  We settled on a 1/2 bottle of a French white which complemented our meal well.  The wine server  was very knowledgable, kept our glasses full and spoke with us extensively about the dessert drink options.  My wife tasted, and then ordered, a glass of Madeira and I had a fantastic Amaro.  There were a handful of dessert options but we were plenty full and enjoying the after dinner drinks.  The interior design of the restaurant is very eye-appealing.  Despite the hard wood floors and background pop music, we found the noise level not to be a problem.  The overall meal is pretty pricey but considering the excellent execution and location, it's not out of line for the experience.  If we were closer, we'd be back for date night!",

The food is actually good too but the prices are a bit steep for how small the portions are. $17 for chicken skewer app, 10 for grits, and $16 for small lump crab lettuce cups. Everything flavor wise was on point just wish portions justified the price. Good if you want small tapas though. And everything fresh.",

Mushroom Grits- the mushrooms on top were to die for.  Bacon wrapped dates- drool  Scallops  Thai chicken Flatbread- I just loved every element of this dish.  My group all had wine flights which was a great way to sample all sorts of wines. I personally had the Running with the Bulls flight and I loved each wine.  To top it off the music in this place was off the hook. I wish they had dancing!!  Super cute, yummy food, good tunes.  Go here.",

    "text": "Sunday brunch, beautiful garden inspired patio, long booth for us, so relaxing and comfortable, a bit of a retreat from the strip, with a hint of romantic....perfect for a quiet Sunday after hard partying on Saturday night ;p. We were looking for a restaurant for lunch at Wynn, this place looked pretty nice, decided to give it a try, host lady was very friendly, took us to a nice patio table, our super cute eye candy waitress Lisa came to us, introduced the brunch with bottomless mimosa or mojito options, also gave us a wine list to decide.   The brunch buffet was amazing! Unlimited salad bar in the front, along with chilled soup, veggies, fruits, pastries, assorted cheese and carving station. Servers brought us tapas every few minutes, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, ham or veggie flatbread, potato, beef sliders, mushroom gratin, pancake, French toast on a stick, steak Benedict...so many choices, they were so delicious! Our mimosa and mojito were so yummy and strong, they brought a few desert treats too after we finished our brunch.  The service was great, all eye candy waitresses kept our glasses full all the time, servers kept bringing us more and more tapas. We enjoyed our brunch so much, with the garden patio seating? Even better!   The tab was $130, with bottomless mimosa and mojito for $20 each. It was funny I had to run back to give our waitress Lisa more tips, cause hubby realized he didn't give enough, and she deserved more. :)   Love this cute little restaurant, romantic, intimate and relaxing, one of my favorites in Vegas. :)",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I came here for our highlight bachelorette party dinner and it was FANTASTIC. I've loved every restaurant I've gone to at the Wynn (Tableau for brunch) and will continue to make sure I try one of their restaurants every time I'm back in Vegas!   Every dish was delicious, plus their service was awesome (we needed to be out of there within 2 hours to make our show and all our dishes came within 20 minutes of us ordering! It gave us extra time to lounge around and order extra drinks at the end of the meal before we had to go. The environment   On to THE FOOOOOD!   *Thai Snapper Ceviche, Asian Pear, Habanero - $15 4 stars Great way to start the meal - light, well balanced flavors, fresh seafood. I don't even normally like ceviche but I liked this one as it had some really stand out flavors!  *Jumbo Lump Crab Lettuce Cups, Citrus Segments - $16 4.5 stars Love the contrast in texture between the fresh lettuce cups and the crab. The citrus added a great tangy kick to the flavor. A wonderfully simple but refreshing dish.   *Bacon Wrapped Dates, Blue Cheese Fondue - $12 3.5 stars Delicious - as bacon wrapped dates always should be. The I thought the blue cheese would add a really unique bit of taste but it was a bit bland, also a bit too much creamy (like those dips that come with those veggie platters at the grocery store).  *Beef Carpaccio, Arugula, Truffle Aioli - $15 4 stars Yummy, tender, well balanced.   *Fiery Artichoke, Roasted Pepper, Olives Flatbread - $14 *Chorizo, Italian & Andouille Sausage Flatbread - $15 4 stars Both flatbreads had a great crunchy crust that was soft and steamy once you bit into it. They all had a good balance of flavors.  *Salt-roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese, Pistachio - $10 4.5 stars Beet-lovers (and even non-beet-lovers) unite! A wonderful little dish that has the sweet, the savory, the creamy, the crunchy.   *Lamb T-Bone, Spinach, Pomegranate - $19 4.5 stars The lamb is SO tender and delicious. With just enough pomegranate seeds to add that kick of unique flavor into every bite.  *Diver Sea Scallops, Polenta Cake, Shrimp Sauce - $17 4.5 stars Fantastic use of seafood, soggy carbs (my fave), and a delightful sauce.   *Chocolate risotto 3 stars Well done, and it came with some small cookies, but nothing particularly unique/memorable about this dish. Get if you like chocolate rice pudding =).  *S'mores flatbread 4.5 stars Ohhh yes. A delicious fatty way to end the meal.",

    "text": "One of the most enjoyable Sunday Brunches I've had to date. It's advertised as \"Butler-Style Brunch\" or, American Dim Sum, I was a bit confused by what they meant until it was explained to us. Small plates that are brought around to your table by the servers, and you pick what you want. My previous experience at La Cave was great, the outside patio option, and the view of the pool, plus the food was excellent, made me anxious to come try brunch.   A little kink in the service, we did sit for awhile before being offered a drink, after someone had noticed, we were started out with bottomless mimosas ($20 extra on top of cost of brunch) but it did include a variety of drink options if mimosas aren't your thing.  They included;   Bloody Mary Caipirinha Margarita Mojito Sangria (white or red) Mimosa  I liked that you are able to switch them up.  Table side items inlcuded:  Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Salad Chilled Tomato Soup Fresh Fruit Salad Yogurt Parfait with Granola Cornflake Crusted Brioche French Toast NY Style Egg Sandwich Scrambled Eggs Angus Mini Burgers Mushroom Grits Baked Potato Loaded Tater Tots w/ Brown Gravy Tomato Mozzarella Flatbread Chef's Selection Ham & Egg Flatbread Eggs Benedict with Chorizo, Canadian Bacon or Filet Veal Short Rib Hash Pancakes with Berry Compote Bacon and Chorizo Sausage Cups  Everything we had was really good, but a few really stood out, I'm not a huge french toast lover, but the one served was by far the table favorite. I had 3 servings (don't judge, they're small). The mushroom grits and the Eggs Benedict Filet, oh and the Fresh Fruit Salad (sounds boring but it was outstanding) were  my favorites.   I'm not sure if it was intentional, but we did wait quite awhile in between servings, not sure if this is to let you rest and digest before the next server comes around with items, but we did have to ask a few times for refills on our drinks and well as food. There seemed to be plenty of staff. Service wasn't bad enough to knock a star off, we really did enjoy our food. Already making plans to come back.",

    "text": "I came to Vegas for a bachelorette weekend for a close friend and was charged with finding places for our party to eat (perks of being a Yelper!). I had to work with the diets of a couple veggie/vegan friends and that slightly limited my choices of eateries in Sin City. However, googling and Yelping showed that The Wynn's head chef was a converted vegan and many of the hotel's restaurants had vegan choices...yay!   Vegan/veggie menu? check. Classy venue? check. Cocktails, beer, and/or wine to start off our bachelorette party right? check!  The ATMOSPHERE in here is a combination of a classy restaurant/lounge -- there are traditional tables to sit at along with comfy couches/benches too. Instead of huge bay windows, the wall just opened up on one side of the restaurant and we got a wonderful view of the High Roller Ferris Wheel throughout our meal.   Onto the FOOD!   Even though this is considered a \"tapas\" restaurant, I thought their portions were much larger than traditional tapas. I got the chicken thai flatbread and it had the most amazing spicy chili sauce on top. It was also very filling! Upon request, they offered a separate vegan/veggie menu and my friends all enjoyed the mushroom ravioli.  For the DRINKS...  They had many beers on tap and a large selection of wine. There is also a full bar for cocktails. I ordered a SANGRIA and it came in the largest glass ever...it was like half a fish bowl! I loved the fresh berries and apples in my drink.   The SERVICE was very accommodating here. I was able to make a RESERVATION via Opentable and they even called me the day of to confirm our spot. I really appreciate restaurants checking in because I hate having my party wait upon arrival while they get our table ready. We were running a bit late due to traffic on The Strip, but they still held our table for us 30 minutes after our reservation time.   If you're ever in need of a classy restaurant with a diverse menu (especially for vegetarian and vegan eaters), I highly recommend La Cave at The Wynn!",

This made us even later for our show... and it turns out it was their mistake because one of the girls paid in cash so there was no cc receipt to sign.

I read reviews people said they had a good time others said there was a nice ambiance. None of this was True.  Let me start with service. It wasn't terrible if u like that your server doesn't care. The only reason I tipped her is cause I'm in the industry and felt bad for the bussers. She barely let us know the menu and could care less. And pretty much only stopped at the table to take the order and pick up the check. We ordered a bottle of wine also. The came to table presented it then took it to the back to open it. I'm not balling and buying crazy expensive bottles, but that's not how u do it. Especially for a restaurant specializing in wine. The food was about the quality of some wanna be tapas shanti that can't make its food cost, so they go extra cheap.  Shrimp ceviche had some flavor but was impossible to taste it cause you needed a spoon to get the sauce out of the dish and That was non existent. The beef carpaccio was decent. The flatbread was just another flatbread, the beignets were over cooked and not doughy in the middle. The crab was canned crab on lettuce with an orange wedge. I get simplicity but not with that product.  Overall mediocre meal with lackluster service at a high price.",

The atmosphere inside near the pizza ovens and bar would have been more interesting but the outdoor area was enjoyable.   Our server explained the menu and special and responded to our questions very well. She was busy with several tables the rest of dinner and could have checked in on us a few more times.  I had the Spanish wine flight but had to ask for a copy of the wine menu again because she didn't explain each of the wines.   We enjoyed the asparagus with jamon Serrano and egg; those Spanish pigs are tasty. The beets with goat cheese were not as good as I had hoped. The bacon and quail egg flatbread was just ok but filling. The veal short rib pasta was quite good especially with the Spanish red wines on the flight. But the winning tapas of the night was the sea scallops with polenta. You only get two and we could have eaten ten they were so good.   Overall La Cave was a good place to enjoy tapas and wine on the north strip. But I was not wowed like I am when I eat at Jose Andres restaurants like Jaleo. If I'm anywhere near the central strip and in the mood, I'd rather eat there.",

They have these 2 swings in the corner that you can sit on, and these 2 really relaxing looking chairs you can eat at. THE END. The cons.....oh the cons! The price for brunch is ridiculous, especially when you add in the bottomless drinks. The service is HORRIBLE....like, can you pass me again without offering me food....thanks! The waitress didn't even know what one of the drinks was.....there are only SIX drinks....and FIVE everyone knows: margarita, mimosa, mojito, blood mary, sangria. The last one was a brazilian rum drink (I dont know the name, but I dont work there so I dont have to!) The food was eh. I mean, really EEHH (shoulder shrug). Nothing stands out, nothing was delicious or OMG, you have to try it. Well, that's not True. The yogurt parfait was delicious. That's it Freakin yogurt.....add some lemon zest and basil and BAM, it's tasty. PASS on this place. Save your time, and your money. Not worth it. Half price? Not worth it.",

I was seated by a very snotty, skank hostess who apparently had little interest in the answers to her canned hostess questions: Was I a guest here? No. How do I like staying at the hotel? Uhm, I'm not. Would I like a wine list? No, I'm not drinking tonight....still got the wine menu. Why even ask if you don't even care??? Robot in fishnet stockings that she was, I'm glad she got off her stripper pole at the gas station in North Vegas in time to come to work at La Cave and find me a wobbley little table. YIKES.  Anyway, I was dining alone and sat at the table waiting for a waiter/waitress for well over 15 minutes without ANY service, water or otherwise. Waitstaff walked by constantly, still no service.  Since I was on a tight schedule, I got up and tracked down a waitress in the kitchen area and politely explained to her what had happened and then handed her back my menus. No one cared and no one tried to remedy the situation.  I wound up eating at another restaurant in the hotel, with great service. Sorry, La Cave. Your service was beyond rude, your hostess staff was dirty and I was happy to take my 40% tip elsewhere.",

We went on a Tuesday night before going to a show right there at the Wynn and enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio of the restaurant.  The wine list was quite lengthy and we had a great bottle of Pinot Gris, which was kept chilled for us on a very hot day.  The food was absolutely phenomenal. I have a big appetite and usually stay away from Tapas-type places but we were able to order plates one at a time to make sure we had enough food (but not so much we couldn't enjoy the show after). The scallops were a highlight, along with the bacon and egg carbonara. The flatbread was delicious and a bit more filling and the sliders were excellent.  Thanks to Nikia for tremendous service and a truly memorable dinner.",

If you are looking for that kind of an environment, this is a nice place.  I was with my kids and they were hungry we decided to stay anyways.   The Thai Flatbread - not too bad for the size and price.  I personally don't like the Thai flavors on pizza or flat bread it always too sweet.  My kids liked it so I guess it was alright.   Cavatelli Lamb with brussel sprouts - it was ok it's super small...Good thing I wasn't hungry so it was fine.  Angus Burger Sliders - Now if a 9 year says his burger is dry then you know it's dry.  They eat McDonalds all the time and don't complain.  These sliders were really bad doesn't live up to it.  French Fries - Surprisingly, they were the best things, then again they're probably frozen fries.     Beignets - You get 5 doughnut holes with some jam for $9, talk about getting ripped off.  I ordered a 4oz pour glass of wine and my kids had soft drinks, bill came out to $96.  I guess you pay for the ambiance and not the food!!!",

The staff was helpful and friendly, as well as the manager Rich. He made great suggestions and we had an enjoyable conversation with him. You feel like the food is made with care and attention to detail. And the service allows you to enjoy yourself, they don't make you feel rushed which irriates me about other places. We are glad we went, it's hard for me to find a place on the strip where it feels like the staff genuinely cares and works well together",

The veal short rib with brusell sprouts was delicious,  but unexpected specially since the description didn't mention it would be penne pasta with shredded short rib.  The sauce more than makes up for the misleading description.   The flavors in the beef carpaccio decadent, too bad it's such a small portion.   The ceviche had no flavor,  u couldn't even taste the lime,  that alone makes me want to take a star away,  but everything else was delicious.  I wish they would bring the lamb chops back.   The place is suppose to resemble a wine cellar hence \"La Cave\"  but it could be too dark for some folk. Oh and the portions are too small for the price of each dish.    The price range was from $8-12 for salads not bad,  but $15-20 for main dishes,  which are tiny.    By the way I'm not a fat ass that gorges on food I actually like sharing with my significant other,  and I believe in quality not quantity,  but these portions could use a slight enlargement. :-)",

The bacon wrapped dates were scrumptious, the flat breads delicious, the prosciutto  stuffed chicken was rich and robust, and the diver scallops to die for. But the pie de resistance was the carpaccio. It was THE BEST I have ever had. We ordered 7x over. 7! I'm not kidding. That good.   So next time you are in Sin City check out La Cave.

When the line for the Buffet is easily over an hour long or you don't feel like paying the extra $12 for the VIP line, consider coming to La Cave to enjoy a meal. Tapas-style portion sizes means you can order a bunch and share it amongst the table.  If you're looking for a cozy brunch, La Cave offers an AYCE served-tableside brunch option. Think of those Brazilian churrascarias, but instead of coming by with skewers of meat, they come by with trays of yummy breakfast items including but not limited to berry crepes, french toast sticks, jerk chicken wings, pancakes, sausages, grits, tater tots, and CUPS of bacon. Yes, that's right. You can have CUPS of bacon at your table. Oh, and short ribs (of all things??)  If you can score a seat on the patio, you'll have a nice view of the guest pool, and if you happen to be at the edge of the seating area, you'll catch a nice balanced draft of A/C and desert air.",

The staff was amazing, one of the bartendar was the master in food recommendation and the other bar staff was the wine expert. Perfect team! The place is little too warm for me, which made the wine too warm for my taste. Even if poored from the wine fridge, it was too warm for me.  The food was amazing, the ambiance was great. The bar high chair were not comfy but the bartender recommended switching them with the one from the middle of the place which were much MORE comfy!!

    "text": "La Cave is an alluring, quaint little restaurant within Wynn that was my second gastronomically-bookmarked stop in Las Vegas. It's a potentially dressy but not too dressy, intimate but not too intimate venue, with both indoor and outdoor seating. I enjoyed the ambiance within La Cave, especially the hammock swings, but the nonchalant attitude of our hostess and server put a bit of a damper on brunch.  Jumbo lump crab lettuce cups with citrus segments: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-fnYvr2bthdzOn_LhMx8mA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) The lightness of this dish was very refreshing, but the straight-out-of-the-refrigerator coldness of the lump crab meat kept me from loving the preparation. The presentation, as shown on the picture, was also a bit lacking. I liked the acidic balance of the citrus segments, but I would have preferred they be sliced into smaller bits and interspersed throughout the crab.  Kale salad: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ko9BBn19wVjVCnKSiKhqWA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) I love the taste of kale by itself, so it's very hard to go wrong with kale in my book. The fresh kale itself was tender and springy, but the dressing was deathly sweet. It was so sweet that I had trouble tasting the actual taste of kale, which was disappointing. As I'm allergic to apples, I requested that they come on the side (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=q2HJIqSFmGU7syb3UvF8NA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>). I would have also preferred that these be cut into thinner, smaller slices.   Warm beet salad with goat cheese: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ZcU6FdfmQS_6Y76YjiMWkA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) This warm beet salad was probably my favorite dish of the meal, as the beets were cooked perfectly and cut into the perfect bite-sized cubes. There was a generous amount of melted goat cheese that was flavored well, and it was almost fondue-like how I was able to dip the beets into the goat cheese for a tasty morsel. The presentation was also adorable; this is a must-order for beet-lovers.   Lamb shank atop bed of couscous: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Co3RQUf9w82XKO1zHQeScQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) The couscous was blatantly undercooked and underseasoned. The lamb shank was cooked well, but also a tad underseasoned, which I didn't mind because I like the natural taste of lamb. For someone who minded gaminess though, it may have been too much. It was an elegant dish that just fell a little short of the mark.   Shrimp with piquillo peppers and fingerling potatoes: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=d1i5jsyqWYdq8xXTnrcQZw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) We added this dish on at the very end, so I'm not sure if it was because I was pretty full by the time it was served or if I was just not really that big a fan of it.. I liked the tangy citrus notes of the sauce, and the fingerling potatoes were cooked well, but there were maybe two total.. and they were cut into halves. The shrimp also just didn't have much of a shrimp taste, which is something that always bugs me: when food misses its nature-made taste.  Bacon and quail egg flatbread: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=CJQ-fBIpDVVd-3El6GlF4Q&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) Out of the two flatbreads, this was definitely my favorite, and I'm usually not a fan of bacon (I know, I know). The huge chunks of fatty bacon were a bit more like ham in my book, and the runny quail eggs (more please!) somehow cut the heaviness of the meat and cheese. The perfect toastiness of the flatbread, with its crunchy outside and fluffy inside, set off the dish nicely.   Fiery artichoke and pepperoncini flatbread: (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H9hg3GRikNP-ce7mAjuHNg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) The large portions of flatbread with glaring deficiencies of toppings made me immediately \"meh,\" and the unimpressive flavors just reinforced that sentiment. I remember the pepperoncinis being very sour, but not much else. The flatbread was a tad overbaked compared to the previous one.   I'm not sure if I would return to La Cave, as the price point was a little high for mediocre quality, and the small tapas-like plates tend to add up quickly. If I do, I'll definitely order the bacon and quail egg flatbread and warm beet salad again.",

Food is made to order and the server continues to come with what is on the menu. Be careful, COME HUNGRY, Because you will be super full at the end. Everything is fresh!!! Drinks are so good, you have an option of choosing from 5 different ones. My favorite dish is the loaded tots as well as the NY egg sandwich. I am originally from NY and that brought back serious memories.  I will definitely come back and I highly recommend this place!",

My mom asked for a manager and the hostess sent her next store to get him. (That's her job)  She shouldn't have had to go get him.  Someone in the restaurant should have asked the girls to turn the speaker off.  The manager told my mother he would take care if it. And no one ever came to address it.  So when we left my mom asked Bryson what the managers name is and he said jennaveve. The hostess sent her next store for what?  So the manager was a girl and she was in the building?  Ugh.   Regardless the food was excellent and the atmosphere is great. Our server was super nice and the manager (jennaveve (not sure of spelling) was great too)   The hostess dropped the ball and someone in the restaurant should have addressed the girls. A customer shouldn't have had to ask for a manager to take care of that!",

    "text": "A Great Manager Makes a Greater Restaurant Experience:  We ate at La Cave last night. It was amusing that most of the patrons resorted to smart phone flashlights in order to read the menus as the dining area is rather dark. The food is quite interesting with multiple flavors blending together in original ways to make each small dish a unique taste experience. We enjoyed the deconstructed Caesar salad in which a wrapped layer of prosciutto added an interesting angle. We particularly enjoyed the crab ravioli. My wife was less enchanted with the mushroom and truffle grits although I liked it enough. We ordered four plates and two wines. The drinks and first three dishes arrived promptly. Then something went wrong (who knows what) and we waited and waited for our fourth dish. After a very long time sitting in the semi-dark of this establishment a waiter brought a plate of crusted ahi tuna to our table saying compliments of the house. We enjoyed it well enough. A few more minutes later the manager, Rich, came to our table apologizing profusely for the delay and saying it was unacceptable. (I politely agreed with him.) He then offered to buy us two more glasses of wine and said he would adjust our bill. He recommended two interesting white wines to accompany our soon to arrive shrimp with shishito peppers. Our waitress Melissa was also great. Personable and sympathetic to our less than stellar dining experience. Rich came back to our table a couple more times to check on us. He personally supervised my perfect decaf espresso (also gratis) so I could be sure to sleep last night. My wife and I decided to split a dessert of beignets with three sauces. Delicious although not Cafe du Monde (but amazing for Nevada). At the conclusion of our two hour meal we were presented with a remarkably adjusted bill. We were very pleased with the way Rich and Melissa saved our dining experience.",

The food The best dish I had by far was the beef carpaccio with truffle and capers was amazing. I wanted to lick up the sauce on the plate after! Crispy ahi tuna was good and unique. The Flatbreads were decent, the sliders just average, nothing special, not worth $15. I was dissapointed in the onion soup which had very little substance under the dough and too salty. The wygu was a little chewy. For dessert I highly recommend the beignets which comes with three different dipping sauces.   Atmosphere was classy. Service was decent. Not a bad experience but with so many other restaurants to try it don't think I'll be back.",

They even have a couple of those chairs that hang from ropes....very fun to sit in and have a couple of glasses of Wine.  Cigar smoking was allowed on the back patio....a few people took advantage of it and the awesome weather we had that night.  Overall, I was very impressed with this restaurant and their staff.

I could see the face of my date, or potentially the food that was placed in front of me (we hadn't ordered yet). Then, BINGO, the lights were turned off and I was in a DARK, dark cave. Too much mood lighting for my taste. It made me want to lay down and go to bed. More importantly, it left me wondering what my food even looked like. Presentation of the food and overall ascetics adds to experience. Don't take this away with dark lighting.  Now to the food,   Gorgonzola Salad, Bibb Lettuce, Pickled Onions, Crispy Prosciutto  - good overall. Tad too much cheese. All I tasted was gorgonzola. There was also something sweet on the plate that tasted like dates... BUT I couldn't see for the life of me what it was thanks to the lighting.  Bacon Wrapped Dates, Blue Cheese Fondue - okay, the dates were too sweet, but the blue cheese fondue attempted to offset that  Chorizo, Italian, Andouille Sausage Flatbread - it was okay. I wish I went with the chicken pesto  Onion Soup, Puff Pastry, Gruyere Cheese - it was okay.  Angus Mini Burgers, Mushroom, Chipotle Mayo - good dish",

I sat in the middle -- a sort of open-air dining room with the best of both. Nice!  The food is great, but expensive. We had roasted beets with goat cheese, quail's egg pizza, some kind of steak and mushroom dish and a sort of deconstructed Caprese salad. The salad was really small and weird, but everything else was great!  The clientele is a mix of upscale one-percenter hipsters and upscale one-percenter thirtysomethings. Some kind of pleasing background music played; it was either jazz or some kind of loungey electronic stuff. The fact that I can't remember means it was played at exactly the right volume!  Overall, recommended!",

    "text": "After searching Yelp for quite some time, my mom and I landed our sights on La Cave. At first, they tried to seat us right by the kitchen/pizza oven but we quickly asked to me moved with no argument from the friendly hostesses. We sat close to the bar and were able to peak into the enclosed patio area.  The atmosphere was dark and sultry with music playing loud enough to sing along during a pause in conversation.   We both needed a minute to decide on which wine flight to order and the waiter was gracious enough to invite the Somm over for some suggestions. The Somm was really nice and friendly. Not pompous and arrogant as others I have met in the past. I asked for a specific wine to pair with the chocolate cake and they did not have it. He was gracious enough to talk to the wine director to find something to fit my fancy. And it did!  It was recommended to order 2 plates per person and it was right on! We started off with the mixed greens salad. Moved onto the warm beets where my mom was oooooing and ahhhhing after every bite. I had never had beets before and I even liked them. For our third plate we went with the Veal short rib pasta. The portion was generous and I would have been fine eating that alone. It was warm and delicious. Total comfort food. For our last entree we had the beef medallions.  I absolutely HATE bleu cheese and the kitchen had no qualms about substituting mozzarella on my filet instead of the bleu. Of course we had to order the cake as well and it was a nice way to end the night. As we chatted with the somm, I mentioned that we were celebrating a belated birthday for my mom and they brought out a small chocolate mousse with a candle on it for her.   With 2 wine flights, 4 plates, one cake and 2 after dinner dessert wines our total was just under two hundred and worth every penny. I would totally visit La Cave again!",

The service was amazing.  I came back the following day to have a quick drink at the bar- similarly, the service was wonderful.  I can't wait to go back!

We arrived promptly for our 9 pm reservation.  After a brief wait, we were seated at what I would call \"lounge\" tables.  The tables were no higher than my knee.  To give some perspective, no higher than my knew is super low since I'm only 5'3\".  \"Lounge\" tables are just fine to sit at while sipping on cocktails, but not good for eating an actual meal.  Plus, unless you like to give people a peek at your crotch, it doesn't work so well for ladies in dresses.  They were nice enough to move us to a regular dining table, but that only meant an additional delay before eating, which probably put a damper on me even possibly enjoying the food.",

The food was served more like a tapas, so everyone is to eat off the plate. Portions are small depending on what you are ordering. Did not have a chance to try the wine. The cheese platters are excellent.  The only thing I would recommend is set reservations for this place because it was packed and we had to wait for a table.",

    "text": "Here's a review that's long overdue. I dined at La Cave at the Wynn a couple months back for Father's Day. Their weekend brunch is an all you can eat feast served butler style -- meaning the servers walk around with trays of food and you pick what you want, like a dim sum place. It is more expensive than the buffet ($48 for adults and $28 for kids under 12) and a less diverse selection, but the quality of food is probably better and (for all you lazy people out there) you never have to leave your seat while dining. For an extra $20 you can get all you can drink bloody mary's, mojitos, and caipirinhas.  Dishes that were served included:  Pork ribs - meaty, tender, with a little heat from the sauce. Sliders - the beef patties were well seasoned and juicy and the bun was soft and slightly chewy. Pancakes - small portions are perfect for sampling. The light texture of the batter worked well with the raspberry compote. Cornmeal crusted French toast - the crunchy exterior and light fluffy interior made for a delicious combo. Jamaican jerk chicken - the thick, crunchy exterior was exploding with flavor and gave way to the tender, juicy meat underneath. It was one of the best dishes of the day. Egg with a veal hash - a large portion that was plenty for two to share that was served in a cute little cast iron dish. The meat was oily but the amazing potatoes and mushrooms made up for it. Caprese salad - the slices of tomato could have been thinner. It was decent overall, but nothing too special.  Yogurt parfait - I didn't try it but we did get some fresh berries that were delicious. Steak and egg benedict - the steak was ok and the muffin was stiff, thick and chewy. The egg was overcooked but the hollandaise was perfectly balanced between the egginess and butteriness of it. Cup of bacon - it was nothing fancy, just a white cup with bacon, but it was delicious. You can't go wrong with crispy bacon. Asparagus - another dish I didn't try but it did look good. I didn't want to ruin my meal with too many vegetables. Mushrooms and grits - i enjoyed the creamy texture of the grits and liked the toothsome bit of the mushrooms, but there was way too much truffle aioli. Tater tots - not sure if these were made in house or frozen, but they weren't bad. By the time this dish came around I was so full I could only have one or two. Flatbread - pretty good, the crust was slightly crunchy yet chewy.  To finish the meal they brought out a couple plates of chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal and golden raisin cookies, and chocolate raspberry brownies. I was stuffed but had to try one of each. The chocolate chip cookies were great -- chewy and warm, the oatmeal cookies were ok, and the brownies were excellent -- fudgy, dense, and moist.  The mojitos were good but could have used more mint and the caipirinhas were strong with just enough sweetness to them.  It was an excellent way to spend Father's day and a great alternative to the madhouse that is the buffet. The relaxed and intimate setting on the patio is the way to go if you want to stuff yourself silly without having to move. And after you're done you probably will (like me) have some difficulty getting your fat ass off your seat.",

    "text": "We went to La Cave as a party of 6.  Tapas + party of 6 = very expensive meal.  The reason is because you have to order 2 or 3 of each dish so that everyone can try it.  We ordered a number of dishes: salt-roasted beets with whipped goat cheese, caesar salad, stuffed chicken, shrimp, sirloin steak, chicken and fontina flatbread, bacon wrapped dates, angus mini-burgers, and s'mores flatbread for dessert.  Most of the dishes come with 6-8 pieces, except for the salads.  Probably the best dishes were the shrimp, bacon wrapped dates, and sirloin steak.  Everything else was good, but not mind-blowing or very special.  Service was very good, and the atmosphere is nice.  Note that it can get very loud in the dining area, especially in the front room next to the bar.  If you like tapas, La Cave is worth checking out.  But if you go, bring one friend (two at the most).  Otherwise, you'll be seeing a long bill, as is shown in a one photo.  I personally am not a tapas fan because it's not really a good value.  However, it can be fun for happy hour, or a light meal.",

Slow to the greeting, slower to the order, food came before the wine even though we had ordered wine first thing, took 20 minutes (no kidding) to get the bill after asking, and then we were given the wrong one.  Something is (or at least was) dreadfully wrong, the manager knew it, but could not solve the problem.",

    "text": "Debated 4 and 5 stars on this place as the context of Vegas makes it hard. Anywhere else, a solid 4, in Vegas, it gets a big 5.   Inside the Wynn casino, La Cave is american small plates served tapas style with a very comprehensive wine list. There are a range of small dishes which are actually pretty big and some interesting and thoughtful wine flights which are fun. The atmosphere is dark and very lively. It is an excellent place to go to get the party started if you are going out. A little high on the bachelorette party quotient for me but that is Vegas generally.   We started with the Italian flight which was excellent and ordered a bottle of Prosecco for later. The food started coming out fast with the first being the salted beets with goat cheese and mushroom grits. This was actually the first time that I have ever had beets so they were good? My husband enjoyed them so I am assuming they were. I ultimately discovered that beets aren't for me. I do however fancy myself as a bit of a grits connoisseur and the grits at La Cave were excellent.  Our shrimp and flat bread came next and were also excellent. The flat bread was sirloin, blue cheese, caramelized onions, and mushrooms. In all seriousness, with ingredients like those, you would need to try to make it bad. The shrimp was in a pepper sauce and actually went nicely with the grits as a pleasant surprise.   Price wise, it was very fair especially for being in the Wynn so if you are looking for small plates, this is the place. As a side note, Steve Wynn is a vegan and as a result they have a vegan menu which is really nice in the land of steak houses.",

Still, that's a limited sample size, so I can't comment too much on the size matter. But my salad and flat bread were really good. We'd already been drinking a decent amount, so we didn't order wine which actually seemed to annoy the server for a flash, but she was still attentive. We never had to sit with empty water glasses, finished plates were removed promptly, and, as I said, the food was great. Just be mindful of where you sit if you intend to eat - we ended up in the rockers with a low table, and that would be great for some wine drinking, but it was difficult to eat with. I'd still go back; I'd just wait until a real table was open.",

And yet, with such a classification as these I have to ask myself \"How have I NOT been to La Cave before?!\"  Perhaps it was all those Bellagio Buffet visits that got in the way of such a fine Vegas dining experience. Or, as a complete contrast, perhaps it was all those late-night, post-libation cravings for all things fried and greasy. Whatever the case, I'm really glad I came here!  My friend and I had some time to kill as our man-friends waited in line at XS. Starving, we wandered the casino until we found something that looked reputable and served meat. Finding La Cave almost instantly, we both ordered the sliced sirloin and an accompanying wine flight. (Yes, I likely did not enter the establishment sober, but it doesn't take a sober person to know that their steak is LEGIT.) Tender and covered in a mushroom fondue, the sliced sirloin hit the spot. And at roughly $20, the wine flights were a great way to sample from the thorough wine list (as well as continue that pre-clubbing buzz!).  Like most Vegas experiences I happened upon La Cave by chance. UNLIKE most Vegas experiences...I don't actually regret this one!",

    "text": "SAVE YOUR TIME....AND MONEY.     I have never posted on Yelp before but I feel compelled to relay my experience at this supposed fine dining restaurant.   I took my girlfriend to La Cave on New Year's Eve.  When making the reservation they failed to inform me it was prix fixe dinner for that evening.  We enjoy tapas and had heard good things about this restaurant and were looking forward to sampling many different things.   The prix fixe was \"4 courses\".  The first course was two small (remember this is a tapas place) servings of foie gras (did I mention I don't even like foie gras?), the second course was pork belly, again two small servings.  Evidently pork belly is very fatty, it was only a few bites to begin with but I had to cut away about 50% of it in fat.  Our \"main course\" was ONE SCALLOP (I kid you not) and a very small (two or three bites) serving of sea bass....WTH??  The dessert was a brownie!!    I have lived in Vegas for 18 years and have been to many of the five star restaurants in our city.  I have NEVER had such a lame meal at a \"fine dining\" establishment.  We felt ambushed by their prix fixe menu, and it was too late to find another eating establishment (believe me we tried as soon as we sat down but it was New Year's Eve and every other place at the Wynn was either booked or there was at least an hour wait).    Did I mention the cost?   A few bites of foie gras, a few bites of pork belly, ONE scallop and a few bites of sea bass and a brownie.  I had one glass of wine, my girlfriend did not drink.  Our bill with tip was $270 bucks!!!  $95 per person + my glass of wine.  I have been to Aureole at Mandalay Bay for less money!    It is absolutely shameful. We will not be back and will tell everyone else (and the Yelp community) to stay away from this rip off restaurant.  01/07/16 UPDATE Evidently we were not the only customers displeased with the New Year's Eve prix fixe dinner.  I received a phone call from the General Manager apologizing for our experience and inviting us back to give them another try.  I must admit, I do find it telling that the GM would take the time to personally call each customer who took issue with the menu and pricing that evening. In my view that speaks volumes as to the integrity of the restaurant and management who obviously care about their clients and reputation.  We have decided we will give them another chance and perhaps this will be a much better (and typical?) experience.",

We did not see a server for a while longer than I would expect.  Once she did come she have great suggestions for the meat and cheese board.  I ordered a German Riesling. It was a great pick if you like sweet white wine!  Our orders came in timely.  The beef carpaccio was very good.  I love truffle oil. This beef was server rolled in 4 pieces. Very small and light.  We shared but I could have had one order to myself. The cheese board was large. A generous helping of meat... Salami, prosciutto, and a spicier meat.  The truffle cheese, Gouda, and third cheese we had her choose for us seemed so small in comparison to the meat.  Toasted bread and cranberry sauce also complimented the board. Everything turned out to be more than enough for the three of us. We took an hour to eat our appetizers as we were waiting for Allegro to open. The server had not tended to out table since the food had arrived.  After the hour passed we had to wave her down.  As I was taking my last sip of wine she asked me how I liked what I had chosen.  What we are was good.  For the type of restaurant it was, I definitely  expected better service.",

I ended up ordering a half bottle for $52 because hay, it was Thanksgiving and that's just how I roll on a holiday. I'd rather have a nice half bottle of wine than a piddly little glass for more expensive per volume, amirite?  ANYWAY the rest of the menu is great. My friend got the Thanksgiving prix fix menu, which was really quite good. The pumpkin pie was outstanding--those Wynn pastry chefs really know what they are doing!   Can I talk for a second about charcuterie? Like, how it's one of my favorite things in the absolute world? Charcuterie plates for a steal of $33--3 meats, 3 cheeses. Super HQ and devourable.   My flatbread was awesome--truffle, beef, mushrooms, onions. ALL THE THINGS THAT I LOVE. My other friend got the thai flatbread which was also awesome. The flatbreads we just turned into entrees, not so much tapas, but I could see how you could do that.  The inside is dark and the bathrooms are out in the hallway. Genevieve was a bomb server, too!",

The reason I chose this place was because of the neat patio it has in the back with a view over looking the Wynn pool as well as the Venetian and the High Roller.  The area is dimly lit with very comfortable seating giving it a more intimate feel.  We had a bottle of wine at the recommendation of the sommelier, who was awesome, didn't get his name but taller gentleman with a beard and long hair. We savored every last drop of the delicious bottle from South Italy LOL.  Everything we ordered was super tasty and had very good presentation. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, the chicken thai basil pizza, the onion soup, and the three sliders. BIG EXCEPTION: the sliders.  Not sure what happened here but they looked and tasted like little mini whoppers from Burger King.  We were not impressed by them at all and at ~$15 they are not worth it.   The server was SUPER nice!  Very knowledgeable of all the food items and constantly checked up on is to make sure we were okay.  Overall a great experience and would highly recommend to anyone.",

Service impeccable, food delicious and easily sharable and the ambiance outdoors was perfect, neither too hot nor too loud.    Which brings me to the first time: we had dinner here a year ago and it was way too loud.  Like rock concert loud.  Maybe I'm getting old, but if I'm drinking decent wine, I want to enjoy it without bass vibrations.  And the small plate concept may be good for lunch, but for dinner I need a bit more than aesthetics on my plate.",

The two standouts from the meal were the MOA Breakfast Ale and the chocolate marscapone cake with caramel sauce.

He was very impressed with the ambiance, the politeness of the  wait-staff and the incredible presentation of food. He especially liked the liquor dessert where they make it with liquid nitrogen. Yes, he had the traditional crab legs.  For the first time in his life he ate Carpaccio, and was really liking it until I told him it was raw. Then he thought I was trying to kill him.  Overall, the wait staff was great when dealing with my dad, patient and friendly.  I'd easily recommend this place to anyone.

    "text": "All in all the dinner we had was lovely, it's just I live in San Francisco and could get everything on the menu for half of the cost. Hence, the three stars. If you are coming from a place where you don't get to experience amazing wine lists and food and that's your jam, then you will definitely enjoy this place.  We drink a lot of Pinot Noir, and on that front the selection was fantastic. Lots of French and Sonoma County/Russian River options.  The patio is gorgeous, albeit a little hot if you go to early - definitely opt for a dinner reservation that's 7:30PM or later - that's about the time it started cooling down.  Our order: Thai Basil flatbread - this was solid. Really good and unique flatbread.   Beets with pistachios and goat cheese - really tasty, perhaps a bit too rich or heavy handed with the cheese. I love beets so I felt like they were drowning a bit.  Charcuterie plate - prosciutto, sopressata, and a dry salami along with Truffle tremor, humboldt fog, and a beemster type of wisconsin cheese that I can't recall. All good, but nothing surprising here.   Crimson Crush wine flight for 2 - really good selection here. Both of the french Pinot Noirs on this flight were fantastic.  This was more than enough food for two people - I'd actually say slightly too much. So don't be afraid to order the plates as you want them - it was pretty quick.  Hope that's helpful!",

    "text": "I've been to La Cave enough times since it first opened to get the \"lay of the land\" and become pretty familiar with the menu. So far, I've experienced solid cuisine and tantalizing wines. Add the poolside setting, and all in all it's a lovely hideaway for a casual lunch or dinner.  The pizza (sorry, \"flatbread\") with micro mozzarella and capers is quite delectable, and it's big enough to constitute either a good sized entree for one or a tasty snack for two. I had never even realized I like capers before trying this dish here. But once I did, I had a new found appreciation for the salty bite of capers (especially when combined with nicely melted micro mozzarella and crushed good tomatoes on warm flatbread).   And if you're in the mood for something sweet, then don't bother leaving. Just order the beignets and dig in! They're puffy little dough balls that just become extraordinary when dusted with powered sugar and paired with tasty dipping sauces. I tried it with the raspberry jam, the chocolate sauce, and the creme anglaise, and in all cases I had to hold myself back from licking the plate. This may have been the high point of my most recent dining experience here.  Oh, and don't forget the vino! I mean, come on, \"In wine we trust\" is written in Latin on this joint's ceiling! I'm trying to remember the name of the wine I tried on my last visit, but it was red, sparkly, sweet (but NOT Lambrusco!), and quite satisfying. If you like being adventurous with your wine, then you'll most certainly have fun here.  So far, La Cave has been a great addition to Wynn's dining scene, and it fills a void in providing a \"tapas style menu\" at a price point that shouldn't even scare away tourists who think they can't afford anything inside Wynn or Encore.",

    "text": "La Cave is described as a \"Wind and Food Hideaway\" that serves savory small plates and oven fired flatbreads. You are greeted at the front with what seems to be typical for Las Vegas Hotel restaurants. \"Can I have a last name.\" \"Can I have a first name.\" \"Are you staying here at the hotel?\"  At first glance, the restaurant doesn't seem very large. There are 3 different parts to the restaurant: the main dining area, the garden lounge, and the cave. In the front room (the cave), the ceilings are low and there is a bar on the left and seating at a long table in the center. On the right side, you can sit by the open kitchen and watch the food being prepared as you eat. The back room (where we were seated) is slightly larger with higher ceilings and a more open feel. There is seating along the sides and middle of the room, and another bar at back. The last room, which is partly outside, is called the garden lounge.  After we were seated, our waiter introduced himself and made sure to tell us that the food would be \"small plates\" and pointed to the plate on our table to show how large each item would be. Apparently the people that sat down beside us didn't want small plates, so they got up and left. Moving on to the food, we were given a short overview of the menu, told about the Chef's specials for the day, and given an extensive wine list.  We decided to order three things: Meatballs, Marinara, Bread (Chef's special) Sliced Sirloin Steak, Mushroom Fondue, Cippolini Onions Lamb T-Bone, Bacon, Mustard Greens, Fresh Figs  After ordering, the food was brought out much faster than I expected it to be. I suppose this could have been a bad sign (it wasn't). Although not extravagant in any way, the Meatballs were my favorite item from the meal. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the marinara didn't overpower the flavor of the meat. Also, for the price, the portion was very large. The Sirloin Steak was cooked well (I mean flavor, not that it was burned to a crisp). I don't really like mushrooms, but in this case they didn't detract from the overall flavor. Finally, the Lamb T-Bone. This was almost as good as the meatballs.  Great seasoning/flavor and very tender is how I would describe it. The lamb was placed over a bed of mustard greens with bacon. In almost any situation, I hate mustard greens. Not this time though, as they were actually good.  No room for dessert, but I'll assume we didn't miss out on anything special. The desserts are standard desserts served from the hotel (Wynn) and not unique to the restaurant. Beyond the food, the service was very good. From the person that showed us to our table, to our waiter, to the person going around refilling drinks. There was just enough attention, but not too much to the the point of being annoying. The next time I'm in Las Vegas I'll definitely be going back to La Cave to try out a few more things.",

Shouldn't reservations get a little special treatment versus walk ins?  The food is garbage- rock hard waffles, Veal Hash with no salt, sliders with mushroom mush ... come on for $50+ a person.   No doubt this property will go down with Steve Wynn gone.   Steer away from this shit hole.",

Our server was very knowledgeable about the cheeses but two it the three cheeses were dried out and the cheese was way to cold. It was so cold it was difficult to cut it.

I do have to say the French onion soup was amazing. The gorgonzola salad was good too, even though it was overdressed.   $200 dinner for two with 4 cocktails, and 4 plates.

    "text": "Eh. I came here because a friend and I were reminiscing about Nora's wine bar and we were lamenting the fact that there aren't many wine bars in town. I love a good cocktail bar and the quality of the local breweries is spellbinding to me. Nonetheless, I am a total sucker for a great wine and cheese pairing.  I had come to La Cave many moons ago, for a private event and had thought the space was stunning. With that in mind, I suggested we come here for some wine and a snack. The restaurant, or rather the cave, is not quite as I remembered it but still gorgeous. Nice and cozy. PERFECT for a date night. Albeit an expensive one.   We both went with the sparkling wine flight, which offered 4-5 different types of sparkling wines, two champagnes included. We also ordered a bit of cheese with charcuterie, which was quite tasty.   We are both ones to linger over the conversation, perfect for nibbling on small bites and wine. Not so much with sparkling wine though. It took us a good hour to go through all of the tastings, and by the last few they were roo temperature. This our fault really. Red wine would have been a far better choice since we were going for a leisurely evening.  If you are on a date and have a quick hour for a snack, I would recommend that flight. The wine by the glass hovered around 20 dollars I think. A tad steep if you ask me, but then again I really doesn't have a pint of reference for wine in this city anymore. Anyway, if you have the money, it's nice. I think my total came to around 50 dollars. Nice ambience but a bit expensive for this gal.",

They aren't the full menu restaurant type, they serve small portions. And let me tell you. Those small portions fill you up! If you don't want to share, you should order at least two items from the menu to fill you up. The street style corn is delicious, the mini burgers are great, the chicken skewers. We ordered a lot of items. I forgot to take pics. But you will love this place. It's nice and dark inside, not too dark. It's a cute place to go on a date too or if you want some privacy. Prices are decent. Service is exceptional. Our waiter was amazing! He was very helpful since it was our first time here. I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas.",

My omnivore companion loved the ahi tuna and the lettuce-wrapped crab, while I was delighted by the vegan flatbread and and the Gardein chicken with celery root. There aren't many restaurants in Vegas who can offer more than one or two options to vegan diners, but this place had a bunch of great-looking options.",

There was also a big group there, and they were loud. So, we were fine being seated in the second room. Our area was like sitting in a great living room. A couple chairs a sofa and a large coffee table arrangement. There was a beautiful view into the garden. Our seats were near the door between the rooms. The door really needed to be open so there was a breeze to cool the place down, but when the door was open there was a lot of noise from the party in the other room. The food was a bit of a mixed bag. Some was excellent. Some was just OK. So, in the end, it was a bit of a mixed bag. If I was staying at Wynn/Encore again, I'd give it another try. However, it's probably not worth the amount of effort to get here as a destination place. At least not for me. Still, I liked it enough to be a fan.",

The restaurant is beautiful inside with a patio overlooking Wynn's wonderful outdoor space and secluded pool area. I was seated at the window and it was busy and I'm so lucky I showed up just as they were opening - everyone else has a reservation and considering the Wynn buffet line was over and hour wait and the cafe's were all packed with long lines - I totally lucked out finding such a gourmet gem as La Cave.    Ordered the bottomless brunch Mimosas and chances are I'm going to be drunk again before noon - just saying !! So started off the morning right.   The brunch menu is served by the butlers and it's a all you can eat brunch for $48. Very cool !   Started with a fruit salad with berries, watermelon, pineapple all cut into very tiny pieces and shaved basil; very nice  Next was the Heirloom Tomato & Mozzarella Salad; which was nice as well.  The scrambled eggs were ok (cold actually), and the little baby Kobe beef slider was OMG out of this world juicy and just delish (and actually had to have a second one)....the \"tater tots\" loaded with sour cream and bacon were actually incredible !! The guail egg and ham flatbread was out of this world - I'm making that at home - the mushroom & truffle grits were really nice (haven't had grits in so long this sure was a treat !! )...The last dish that I had was the pancakes with berry compote - OMGosh yummy. There were about six other items that I chose not to have and the way they did the service was just fantastic  - 5 star experience ! And they even ask you if you want a drink to go !! WOW !!     Let's see brunch $48 + $20 for Mimosas plus Tax = $73.61 + tip = $ 100 brunch - Expensive (maybe) but I got 4 drinks and a gourmet brunch and it was worth every penny !! (I loose that much at routlet in 10 min - and not as much fun !)   All in all this was likely the best \"buffet\" I've ever had - every single dish was high quality, gourmet outstanding dishes. The best was it was all served to you instead of a cattle line buffet. The Wynn outdid themselves - one of the best meals I've had this week in Vegas !    Actually the whole hotel has impressed me so much. Wonderful place !!    Still can't believe those light posts cost $10k each and there are thousands of them !! Way to go Steve Wynn you ROCK  !  I'm staying here next visit !",

Service was excellent, and food was delivered as soon as it was freshly prepared.  Yes, it gets pricey, but it's consistent with other Similar restaurants on the strip.

    "text": "Come for the ambiance over the food!  I first dined at La Cave for my BFF's birthday party. And by party I mean the birthday girl, myself and our third musketeer. We were keen on a more upscale experience. Somewhere around casual fine dining without breaking the bank. We also wanted to do a girl's night where we could actually talk to each other without a voicebox / stereo system throwdown. La Cave maintains a reasonable volume level and never gets very loud regardless of how full it is.  AMBIANCE  |  It definitely has the low-light, sultry feel going for it with a few very intimate dining areas. In my experience, the further away from the entrance you are the better. The main dining room is alright, but the garden room is a little more luxurious with the indoor/outdoor sliding doors. You get the cozy seating and low ceilings but you get to check out the Lake of Dreams-inspired garden.  FOOD  |  The veal short rib deserves a solid 5 stars. It's always perfectly cooked and really well marinated. At $20, portions are surprisingly bigger than expected. At the same cost, they have the sliced sirloin which is 100% pass. The mushroom fondue is more salt than flavor and on one occasion, it was served cold. Honorable mentions are the warm beets w/ goat cheese and the pepper/artichoke flatbread.  WINE & SERVICE  |  I've been to La Cave on a few different occasions and service seems to be consistently mediocre. You'll see your server a couple times in the beginning but don't expect them to check up on you very much. For my friend's birthday we got a relatively inexpensive bottle of chianti ($70). But the second time I went, my other friend purchased a nearly $300 cab and even then, our server rarely came by to top off our wine glasses. The wine selection is extensive and organized in a way where a wine lover of any calibre can pick something they like. La Cave also being a swanky wine bar also has a pretty decent selection of wines on tap on those fancy Enomatic systems.  Nice choice for a date spot or a GNO!",

The food was so-so.  Not bad, but I've definitely had better.  Overpriced, $50 for lunch, now understand that this is for one.  The wait staff was effective--not warm and welcoming more cold and clipped. The tables for two are to close together, while I understand the need to conserve space I don't want the person sitting next to me breathing on my food.  All in all, I'll be back for drinks,  but I'll be looking elsewhere for the dining experience.",

I was honestly looking forward to giving this joint more than 3 stars but they fell short of what was expected. It all started with the lack of service, knowledge and organization.  When we asked our waiter questions about the menu he kept having to go to the manager/kitchen to ask. Then after ordering he was still having problems with getting our food to the right tables and people, therefore the arrival of our food was slow.   My meal consisted of tomato mozzarella flatbread pizza, caesar salad and some crostini/crab dish that at this point was not memorable. Also the price seemed to be normal for this kind of place, but from the service and food I'd say it wasn't worth it this time around.  I will though give Le Cave props for the beautiful decor and ambiance, but service + food needs improvement. I do look forward to giving this joint another whirl in the near future to see if things have changed.",

    "text": "This was our only dinner in Vegas that I didn't meticulously research ahead of time, and it turned out to be fantastic.  La Cave is a sexy dark little restaurant in the Wynn Hotel, specializing in small plates and wine. We were seated immediately despite lacking a reservation. Unfortunately, given the theme of the restaurant, I was very much not in a wine mood and so opted for a cocktail instead. That said, La Cave offered several different wine flights as well as an extensive menu of by-the-glass or bottles. If I went back I'd be interested to try a flight as they seemed to have interesting themes.  The food was excellent. We shared four dishes: The shrimp with piquillo peppers and potatoes, a three sausage flatbread, the beef sliders, and pasta with short rib and Brussels sprouts. All four dishes were delicious, but the shrimp was far and away the best one. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the seasonings in the dish were just delicious. We fought over the dregs of the sauce. The pasta came in a close second place. The sausage flatbread was surprisingly spicy, so be forewarned if you're heat-phobic. Four dishes turned out to be plenty for the two of us to share, with a small amount of leftovers.  My only reason for not giving La Cave five stars is that the service was very slow, particularly at the start of dinner. We waited quite a while to give drink orders and again to order food. Once the food order was placed, service picked up, as each dish is sent from the kitchen as it's ready. Honestly, the service would not stop me from coming back--it wasn't bad, just slow--but I feel like it kept our experience at La Cave from being \"as good as it gets.\"  Recommended.",

    "text": "After reading other yelp reviews, there are a few standout items at La Cave (including the tableside smoked salmon). Unfortunately, I was not able to try any of these during La Cave's Sunday Buffet Brunch because these items are unavailable during this brunch. This cost $50 per person and an additional $20 for bottomless mimosas/sangrias/mojitos/etc.  The food at La Cave is only decent, probably because I did not get the chance to try their more popular dishes. The Buffet Brunch had a list of about 15 items, ranging from mixed fruits to yogurt parfaits to eggs benedict to mini burgers. Everything was served \"butler-style\" meaning that servers walked around with a platter and asked whether you wanted the items they had available. Of the 15-ish items, only a few stood out. First, the mushroom grits were very tasty. Second, the baked potato tater tots with brown gravy was very crispy and good, but still did not warrant a price of $50 for the quality. The eggs benedict was surprisingly good because the egg was poached very nicely and La Cave had 3 variations of eggs benedict: chorizo, canadian bacon and filet. All of these went well as the meat in the eggs benedict. One of the 2 BEST items here was the veal short rib hash. This was one of the only dishes that actually came out piping hot on a sizzling plate. The veal was shredded and drenched with flavorful sauce. The other item that really stood out was the ham egg flatbread. This was the other item that actually came out hot. The cheese was slightly crumbly and completely melted over the ham and egg. I would've been happy eating an entire piece of this flat bread.  Overall, there simply wasn't enough good dishes to justify a price of $50 even though La Cave had a list of 15 items to choose from.  As for the drinks, the red sangria here was incredible - - in fact, probably one of the best I have ever had. Even though this was bottomless, each and every glass was strong yet delicious. $20 is somewhat steep on top of the $50 meal, but I think it was well worth it!",

All the items were on display at the front of the restaurant, which all seemed to look tasty. Unfortunately, they didn't taste as good as they looked. First, the food served was completely cold. Second, they brought the options around in no sort of order and we didn't even get offered a few things off the menu that was listed. Going from Yogurt parfait to Sliders is not how I expect to enjoy my brunch. They seemed to be passing around more of one food item, than others; so we didn't end up getting all items. Bottom line, their brunch is not up to par with all the other Wynn/Encore restaurants. We called the manager to express our dissatisfaction with the food served to us and he didn't really seem to want to gain our business in the future. For the price we paid for 2 people, this place is definitely not worth it. We will not be going back!",

I am giving it 3 stars because I have been there twice now and both times the service has been horrible.  Both times we have sat at our table for at least 10 minutes before anyone even approached us to offer a menu.  Then, once we got the menu, we had to ask for the actual wine menu.  I mean, you are a wine bar, that should be a given.  Once we had our menus, it took at least another 15 minutes to place our order.  After this, the food is excellent. At one point, the Executive Chef actually delivered part of our order and to check on us.  Overall, I love this place and will definitely continue to go back.  Hopefully they can work out the kinks with the service - it is not a big place and I can not imagine how the Servers would be overwhelmed with the small amount of tables they have at a time.",

    "text": "The dining options in Vegas are endless.  Many of the restaurants are more open, bustling with the activity of a club, or adjacent to the casino floor - with the lights and noise that come with it. La Cave is not this. If you are looking for a more intimate engagement, this may be your place.  La Cave is a tapas-bar, wine cellar set in a modern wine cave setting.  The first thing you will notice is that it is dark, really dark.  Lights come, most noticeably from a neon sign saying - In Vino Veritas - above a long table in the front.. Appropriate. There are also a few platforms, lit from below, with an assortment of empty wine bottles on them.  Stone arches and iron gates help complete the feeling like you are in a wine cave.  They have two bars, one in front and one in back, along with a very nice outdoor patio area.  On the night we were dining, it was about half full, but still was quiet and intimate.    First the wine - excellent selections both in the bottle and by the glass from most regions around the world. I went with the Italian Arneis - which  you don't see a whole lot and my wife selected a very nice Oregon Pinot Noir. They also have a nice offering of craft beers as well as cocktails and liquor options. It's Vegas, so be sure to pace yourself, since you will be going to other places. Though if you just stayed here, that would be a good thing.  The food portions are tapas style, but on the larger side, and everything is excellent.  We started with the Tuscan Bran Salad (tasty) and the Mushroom Grits (excellent). The Angus Mini Burgers were good, and the Pepperoni Flatbread Pizza was shockingly good (after all, it is just sausage, right).  We also had the Smores Desert Flatbread at the end, wow and wow again.   Price? Even for Vegas standards, I felt that this was on the high side, which drops them down a little bit. So, be prepared when you get a table for four with 5 glasses of wine and 5 plates and it is $230 plus tip.  Still, the next time we are in Vegas, we will be back.  Loo Review - Since it is a small restaurant, they don't have their own facilities. You have to go back out of the front door, go left and use the common area bathroom on the arcade.",

Prices range in the $20s max for entrees and appetizers run in the $10s.- all of which seem like a bargain.  The angus steak, fettucine eggs and bacon, and flatbreads are all highly recommended.   I will definitely come back again.",

There was literally 15 minutes between the appetizer and the dessert being brought out. They need to spread it out!  That being said.. ceviche, steak, beets and goat cheese salad and the smores flat bread was incredible!   The ambiance and decor is phenomenal.  Well worth a visit!",

    "text": "We were a rather large group (23 - 7 of which were kids) but they knew this when we made our reservations and we made the ordering process as smooth as possible by having one person order for the group. The manager was clearly overwhelmed by the size of our party - he couldn't even hide his lack of competence. Within three minutes of seating us, he went around both tables to tell our party to keep it quiet. Considering we were the only party sitting inside, who do we need to be quiet for? You? Plus, if you had 23 people seated at separate tables, they would be just as loud.  The service was quick - they were clearly eager to get us out (which is understandable. We actually did an early dinner so we could be out of there before their dinner rush). Was it friendly? Not by any means. I had to thank a waiter three times   before he acknowledged me (he clearly heard me - he just didn't care like an ill mannered 6 year old). The kids started playing with the little fake candles - the ones that cost me $0.10 each at party city and the restaurant $0.0003 each. The manager, who just seems to really hate anything joyous, quickly ran over and YANKED (yes, yanked) them away from the kids. Why was that necessary? The kids were quiet (per his request) and not hurting anybody/anything. Why was he so anti them having a good time? Overall, decent food - unfriendly service - cheap management",

    "text": "We had a friend in town for a convention and all hit up La Cave on a Friday night.  She had an event, so we had an early reservation at 5:30.  No other tables were seated, but a few came in shortly thereafter.  The wine list is solid, but the sommelier was gone for some reason, so after picking our bottle we had to wait at least 10 minutes, which was annoying.  It was a cab, and it was at perfect temperature.  You will spend on bottles here, but they had a few selections by the glass as well.  We shared a bunch of the small plates:  bacon wrapped dates, the steak/onion/blue cheese flatbread, gorgonzola salad, meatballs with polenta (a special), a charcuterie plate, and diver sea scallops.  The charcuterie was $33 for 6 choices, 3 cheese and 3 meat.  You get a LOT of food with this, so while the price tag may seem high, it's certainly worth it.  Excellent quality, and they come with a nice spread and many crustinis.  The menu is not enormous, but what they make, they make well.  I prefer that to having dozens of options that are all average or worse...  The flatbread was also large, with 8 good-sized pieces.  The dates only come 4 to an order, and they are delicious.  The bacon crisps up nicely, but didn't get burned.  They are served with a blue cheese sauce that could have a little more blue flavor for me, but it was a nice sauce nonetheless.  The salad was a slight miss for me if any dish was.  But, overall, a fantastic meal, and we certainly had enough to eat.    It's a cool atmosphere, pretty dark in the evening, but a nice place.  I will return.",

Service by Melissa was superb, friendly and very professional and pleasant.    As well, Aaron the GM dropped by our table, greeted us, helped the wait staff and was exceptionally cordial as we chatted about the restaurant and his career at the Wynn.  I always find it very nice when management takes a serious interest in meeting the needs of their guests.  Kudo's to Aaron and Melissa.  The food is small plate.  Everything was exceptionally tasty and other than the salmon that we were a bit disappointed in, everything from the flatbreads to the charcuterie plate to the crab lettuce wraps were wonderfully prepared and beautifully presented.  We are not real wine drinkers, but we did enjoy a nice Moscato with our meal and Aaron let me know that La Cave has the largest beer selection of any of the restaurants at the Wynn.  This alone is a reason for me to go back and enjoy some craft brews, with a charcuterie board out on the patio.  We are so happy that we finally \"found\" La Cave and are looking forward to going back.",

Especially enjoyed the concept of wine \"flights\" where you can try four wines at a time.  Most dishes are served \"tapas\" style (small portions) which are great for sharing. The flatbreads are a bit larger and will easily replace two smaller plates. Recommend a flatbread and two other plates for a couple. (Leave room for desert)  The diver sea scollops were delicious. Next we had the stuffed ravioli, again delicious. The beef sirloin medallions with caramelized onion were to die for. Then we had a flatbread with cheese, onion and truffle oil. Soooo good. Should have ordered the flatbread earlier and dropped the stuffed ravioli (hard choice).   You have to leave room for desert! We had beignets (French doughnuts) with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces. We also had a dish with pistachio ice cream, blood orange sorbet and tropical sorbet. A perfect way to top off a fantastic meal.   For the most part, the service staff was excellent. They were very knowledgable and helpful when making selections. Perfect attention to detail. My only problem was that our hostess had tables on both ends of the restaurant. So at times it would be several minutes before she could check in on us. Had a very informative and enjoyable chat with Ralph D (manager). Asked him to convey our compliments to the chef. Highly recommended.",

We raised our concerns about the desserts that we had ordered & the floor manager took care of it immediately - which we appreciated her for. But the desserts were still a disappointment tho. Food & experience overall was just A-OK... we weren't impressed as we had hoped for.  Between the 4 of us we shared the following:  :: FOOD :: Jumbo Lump Crab Lettuce Cups  (5/5) Beef Carpaccio, Arugula, Truffle Aioli  (4/5) Grilled Shrimp  (4/5) Diver Sea Scallops  (4/5) Angus Mini Burgers  (3/5) Fontina Stuff Chicken  (3/5) Veal Pasta  (3/5) Chorizo, Italian & Andouille Sausage Flatbread  (3/5) Snapper Ceviche  (2/5)  :: DESSERTS :: Chocolate Risotto  (3/5)    - Unique. I liked it but i don't think my party members agree with me Beignets  (2/5)    - I had better elsewhere. Hate to say but it's not worth the $9. Creme Brulee (1/5)    - Looks good but it was deceiving. Had it remade twice and it still came out undercooked. The second time around they over torched the sugar & it came out pretty burnt tasting.  I'm not sure if I'll come back or not for I really wasn't super impressed by the food. But who knows... I could give it a second try. i do love tapas and it's so close to XS :D",

We ordered random deserts anyway......... Our group of 6  left at 10:45. We also were not told that an automatic gratuity was added, which was fine, except we then tipped on top of the tip not knowing this....it was so dark on the patio.  Called the restaurant the next day, left information  for the managers and they never returned my call and proceeded to charge our account for the additional tip!  Not the best experience!

Flatbread was good, but the beignets were AWESOME!  Plates are small but the price is a bit high, compared to what you'd expect at a \"tapas\" restaurant.

The cheese plate was awesome, except they don't have any gluten free crackers or bread. They did provide apple slices, but I can't eat those either.  The crab cups had very little flavor and they were really running. I had gross crab juice running down my arm.  There are no GF pizza or pasta options, and items that could be GF unnecessarily have gluten in them.   That was about all I could eat on the menu, so I just sat there while my boyfriend kept ordering little plates for himself, that he enjoyed.  For a wine bar, I would expect the wine to be the correct temperature. Our red wine came out really, really warm. Hating to do it, I added ice to the glass, but it then was like warm, watered down wine.  It is really nice that Steve Wynn has allergy menus at all of the restaurants in his properties. But when there's only 3 things in my section, it made for a quick dinner and a lot of sitting around gagging down warm wine.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his meal, so this is only for the Celiacs out there.",

Again, I think if my expectations weren't so high for the Wynn/Encore, perhaps my review would be better - but, La Cave, in comparison to many of the other fantastic restaurants in these hotels, was a real dud.    Just a few things I'll review..we had an 8:15 reservation and even though the place was more than half empty, we still waited for our table. Our server, who seemed quite aloof couldn't offer us much help with questions about some of the plates, so I got the feeling the food, if he had ever even tried it, wasn't that impressive to him either.  Of the three plates we got, one including a flat bread - which is hard to mess up - none of them were really any good.  We all get a dish we don't love sometimes...but, for all three to miss?  Just surprising.    I will say, the wine was good and the price wasn't unreasonable - but, I do wish this had overall been a better experience.  I had been wanting to try this place for a long time.  Still glad I did....but will certainly be checking out different places in the future.",

    "text": "This is easily one of my favorite restaurants ever!  The customer service was phenomenal, the food was absolutely delicious, the atmosphere could not have been better, and the waitresses & their outfits... well you have to go and see for your self!  Food:  We ordered a variety of things including salmon, flat bread, shrimp, pasta, s'mores flat bread dessert, pinot wine flight, and a couple of beers.  It was recommended to share with the table and it was really nice having a mixture of foods - all of which were cooked to perfection. 5 out of 5  Atmosphere:  \"Darker\" type of environment with both a inside and outside area.  I'm personally a huge fan of this type of restaurant and thought it was visually one of the most appealing restaurants I've eaten at.  There was also a more modern music selection which made the place feel alive. 5 out of 5  Customer service:  When I originally booked the reservation they asked if there was a special reason for my visit and I let them know it was for a 30th birthday.  The person who scheduled my reservation on the phone said she would try to get us one of the nicer tables (all of which are extremely nice) which was appreciated.  Upon the day of our reservation, our flight was delayed so we had to push back the reservation time and it was done without any issue.  The waitresses and bus boys paid close attention to all tables but didn't overly show up at the table.  5 out of 5  If you are looking for a nice place to have dinner, pay an extremely reasonable price for what yo get, and a lot of fun - I HIGHLY recommend La Cave.  We will be back every time we are in Vegas!!",

    "text": "After our not so great 5 star Italian experience from the night before I wanted to go somewhere close- in our hotel. Something light, something quick, and something trendy. La Cave caught my eye right awag from the endless restaurant menus at Wynn/Encore. I thought it would be the perfect place to dine, relax and try a few things.  Fact: Michael Morton created this restaurant!  Here the breakdown:  Ahi Tuna Sashimi-pomegranite flavor, small dish, refreshing.  Thai Snapper Cevice- not impressed. It came with little taro chips, but the fish was very \"whatever\"  Hamachi-refreshing, but nothing special.  Jumbo Crab Lettuce Cumps- a little too watery, hard to eat, but also very light and tender  Charcuterie-amazing! I loved all the difference options of mixing and matching.  Marinated Shrimp-also pretty great!  Angus Mini Burgers- I'm not the biggest red meat fan, but these were pretty delicious and very simple! They came with roasted tomatoes!  Mushroom Grits-the favorite at the table! Even though it was a very small dish it was great for sharing! Very rich and creamy!  My friends also got the Salmon and the beet/goat cheese salad. Both came in small sizes and were perfect for a course or to share.  Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant. We sat in the lounge which had low chairs, dark atmosphere and very lively vibe! I would come back here again!!   It's also a full bar!",

    "text": "Oh, this review breaks my heart.  I am so disappointed.  Whoever decided to close down their wonderful little original store and move into this ridiculously tiny hovel needs to be sent to detention for the rest of the school year.  And the next seven years after that.  And perhaps a lifelong membership after that.  They've moved into a teeny, tiny little place that I'd say 85-90% of their original content is no longer there.  Gone are the cheeses and pates.  The cookbooks and the great majority of all their wine plates and trinkets.   All the charm is gone.  The wine selection is greatly diminished from what it used to be.  With everything else missing, it's lost everything that made the place great.  But I found at least one bottle of wine that I liked.  Not that it was hard to do in such a tiny little rack that now makes up their selection.  It's like a casino convenience store now.  I can only guess financial reasons, or someone in the Paris made them move, but the end result is depressing.  I can't believe that they could justify doing something so foolishly reckless to such a wonderful little place.  Changing up La Cave like this is the \"New Coke\" of bad brand decisions: Pointless and awful.  But Coca-Cola eventually came to their senses and went back to their original ways.  I sincerely hope La Cave will do the same.",

A variety of food options, even a menu for the vegetarians. They do have a full bar which is nice, since most of the cocktails are quite sweet tasting.  The food tasted very good, and they do have some very interesting concoctions. Because it is tapas, and the menu is a bit priceier, if you're super hungry, this might not be the best place for you (try Johnny Smalls or Firefly). But if you're looking for a place with a nice ambiance, this is a nice one. They do have a beautiful patio area overlooking the pool which makes for a beautiful backdrop at the end of your meal.",

We were in a slight rush to make the show which we explained to our server and she was very accommodating.  She was at our table frequently in case we wanted to order more, and brought our food out as soon as it was ready.  In terms of food, I highly recommend Ahi Tuna with pomegranate, ti's absolutely out of this world!  Flat-bread with tomato, mozzarella and capers was also very good.

Great!  5 stars for that alone!   We wanted to try everything on the list, but were forewarned, each dish were very small portions.  we ordered 2.5 dishes per very 2 people, that wasn't enough for dinner.  But everything from the flat pizzas (4) to the scallop cerviche were delicious! After we all had our own desserts.  They were all very yummy.  The smores pizza was my favorite and I don't even like smores!   The pricey dishes kept us from ordering to be full.  As for flavour, it gets 6 stars, for dinner place to go when hungry it gets a 3 star.  but overall I'd rate it a 4 start place.  I'd definitely go again for dinner but make sure you had a full lunch prior.",

We were there for Saturday dinner and were seated on the patio.  Our reservation was a bit earlier than usual so it wasn't as crowded yet and there several large parties so that was a new experience.   One of my favorite parts of La Cave is the selection of wine flights.  I'm partial to white wine so I was excited when the selection of the Worldwide Whites had changed since my last visit.  The chenin blanc & the riesling were my favorites.    We ordered our usual favorites: bacon wrapped dates with fondue (YUM!), the three bean salad, and the mushroom grits.  These grits are what made me start liking grits--they are amazing!  In addition, we ordered the crab lettuce cups & the fontina stuffed chicken; both were great!  And, the icing on the cake was the S'Mores Flatbread--always delicious!  La Cave is always reliable--excellent food, wine & service!",

    "text": "This review is for La Cave at the Wynn Hotel. There is also a restaurant called La Cave at the Paris hotel. Different restaurant, a bit confusing.  Back to business, La Cave at the Wynn Hotel. This is a tapas restaurant. You order a bunch of small plates and share. Everything we ordered (and we ordered a lot) was delicious. There were 5 of us and we probably ordered about 15 different small plates. Also had wine. There was also a vegan in our party, and she ordered 3 different menu items off the vegan menu (you have to ask for it but every single restaurant in the Wynn hotel has a vegan menu if you ask.)  My favorite item was the flatbread with artichokes and ricotta cheese on top. It was amazing. I don't eat meat, but the guys in our party loved the mini burgers. They wound up ordering an additional serving of those. Cheeses were phenomenal. Had to ask for more little breads to go with the brie. My sister the vegan ordered another version of the artichoke flatbread (sans cheese) which she said was phenomenal as well. She also had a beet dish that she said was very good.  Just a couple negatives. First of all, I called this restaurant a couple weeks before our trip to make reservations. I was told that since La Cave was one of the more \"casual dining options\" at the Wynn, they did not take reservations. Upon arriving at La Cave on the night of my 40th birthday, I was asked if we had a reservation. I told the hostess that i had called and was told i could not make a reservation. She said i must have spoken to the wrong person. She proceeded to tell me that their tables were all booked up for the night, but that she could make room for us in the lounge area. This turned out fine. I actually liked the lounge area better than the main restaurant area. A lot more light out there in the enclosed patio area. (Outdoor patio was closed due to high winds....although we saw people sitting out there even after we were told it was closed.) The only problem with the lounge area was that the tables were low and the seating is not really set up for a meal. But it worked out fine since it was a small plates/casual eating situation. I was just disappointed that when i called the phone number listed for the restaurant online, i was told one thing, then was told something different on arrival. I am so glad they had room for us since this was a birthday trip planned months in advance, and i picked La Cave out of all the other restaurants in Vegas due to their menu options that worked for everyone in the birthday party. We dropped about $1,000 at this place, and they almost lost our business. I would say they need to fix this issue asap.  One other caveat: this place is very expensive. It may be one of the more \"casual\" dining options at the Wynn, but not when it comes to the price. Since it is a small plates/tapas style restaurant, you have to order at least 2 plates per person to have enough food (that's why they're called \"small plates.\") Each plate is around $12-$20. And then there's the beverages. A glass of wine will cost you about $15. The cheapest bottle is around $65.  Also, i have to say that I wish there were some restaurants in Vegas where all the servers/waitresses/hostesses were not dressed like prostitutes. No matter where we ate throughout our stay, no matter how upscale the restaurant, without fail, all the waitresses were wearing skin tight stretchy dresses/skirts that just barely covered their private parts. Since it was my first trip to Vegas, this caught me a bit off guard. But i guess that's just Vegas. This is definitely a town set up for men. I noticed that male servers were not dressed similarly/scantily. Just the females (and most of the servers were female in all the restaurants.)",

Must haves - crab lettuce cups, salmon ceviche, chorizo flatbread, lamb chops, grits (one of the best things on the menu) beets. If you don't like beets or grits , order them anyway-guaranteed you will love them. Save room for the smores flatbread. Best dessert ever.",

Where we were seated was extremely dark were it was incredibly hard to read the menu.  I really enjoyed the small dishes allowing us to try several items.  I did feel the menu was limited.  My wife really loved the roasted beets.    I loved the spaghetti, I could have eaten a whole plate of that!   The skirt steak was nice with the little zucchinis was surprisingly yummy.  Unfortunately we had an incident when the waiter tried to refill my wine glass and spilled red wine on my white shirt.  I reassured him it wasn't the end of the world but I was disappointed after that I ended up refilling our glasses myself because no one seemed to want to approach our table after that!  Toward the end of the evening the waiter bought us dessert and a special oatmeal cookie tasting drink.",

    "text": "I was really excited to visit La Cave but I wasn't impressed.  I planned on having a party of 13 eat and drink there for my sister's bridal dinner and went back and forth with the manager regarding seating.  She claimed if we wanted to sit on the patio we had to have a set menu, which would run us about $60 per person.  Honestly, I don't have that type of money and if I did I wouldn't have spent it there.  Also, where is the patio located in this place?  The pictures online are very misleading.  We talked to the manager and wanted a large table in the back and we were told that would be fine.  We were put in the very front of the entrance in the middle of the room ( which was in between two bars).  The thing that irritates me the most is we could have just shown up and probably got a better seat with having to go through all the hassle of reserving a table.    The service was ok.  There was one lady who was actually paying attention to our table and she wasn't even our waitress (I wish I could remember her name).  On several occasions we asked for waters and the waitress said ok and never came back.  In all honesty she knew because the party was over 10 people she had a guaranteed tip included.  She was NOT worth the $91.00 tip.     The food was ok.  I wasn't wowed by anything.  The waitress said everything would come out when it's ready and at different times.  I've worked in a restaurant for 9 years and I'm sorry that's a load of crap.  It's called knowing how long things take to make and timing when to ring things in.  I'm also sure the waitress could walk over to the kitchen and let people know to bring everything out at the same time.    There are hundreds of other places to eat and drink at in Vegas.  Sadly, I will not be back.",

Though the wine options seemed to start above $50 for a bottle .  We tried six small plates: hamachi with hot peppers (divine!), bacon wrapped figs w blue cheese fondue (one of the highlights of the night), butter lettuce w dates Gorgonzola and crispy prosciutto, flat bread w quail egg and fontina, and delish baked clams, and for dessert  beignets w three dipping sauces. I also tried a wine sampler of reds. It was really a nice set of tastings. A couple (if minor) weak points include that unless you stagger your orders , all of the plates come around the same one and the waiter really didn't  advise us of this.  Also I felt the dessert, while tasty, was not quite as superb as the rest of the meal.  All in all, if I were back in Vegas again, I would definitely take a second trip back to la cave among all the other excellent restaurants in Vegas.",

We had reservations,   yet they sat us at their most uncomfortable table  (of which they had quite a few of this stupid uncomfortable table in the dining room.  Not sure who the architect was for this restaurant, but what a mistake putting uncomfortable seating in a restaurant.  One of our guests was a bit late and said he overheard the hostess tell another hostess that if we complained about the table and wanted another table,  that the only table available to us would be the high top table in the front of the restaurant where the bar is.   Well,  we of course asked for a different table.   There were 3 empty nice tables ,  but they said all they had available was the high top one.  We could have left,  but decided we were too tired and hungry ,  so we sat at the hight top table.    We checked later in the dining room to see if anyone was ever seated at the other 3 empty nice tables and no,  no one was ever seated at them.   Shame on you.   Manager had come over as they knew we were not happy,  but did she even give us a free dessert in the end,   nope!   Not sure why they do not care. Sherri C. Summerlin",

Chorizo sausage flatbread- all flatbreads here are cooked in a stone oven and are toasty and big on flavor. Filet minon with blue cheese and truffle sauce- the filet was cooked to perfection and the dish was innovative and extremely satisfying. We got a table next to the outdoor seating area where the sun was ample and the ambiance was relaxed. After a while, they opened the french windows to include the outdoor seating area into the one next to it where we were, and it just added that special touch to an already spectacular afternoon.

You can also ask for specific dishes. However, I did not enjoy the food. I tried pretty much all the dishes and there was nothing I wanted seconds of.  Most of what I got I did not finish. Scrambled eggs were too dry. Benedict was also dry and didn't have enough hollandaise. The steak under the egg was under seasoned. We asked for the burgers to be well done but it came out medium.   For $48 per person, I think I would have eaten better at an actual buffet. The service was good. Unfortunately the food was not. If you are looking for a similar concept, check out the brunch at Border Grill. They don't circulate food but it's all you can eat and you order from a menu and they bring it to you. It's about the same price but the food is way better.",

Food was delicious, with the exception of the flatbread pizza thing. We got the Thai chicken basil one ($19) and it was smothered in a super sweet chili sauce. Like eating candy. Ugh. Shoulda gotten a savory one.  The crab lettuce cups ($16) were really delicious. Not too much mayo, fresh herbs, & citrus...nice complex blend of flavors & textures. DH said it was his favorite thing.  Warm Beets with goat cheese & pistachios ($12) was super tasty. It was served in a little cast iron skillet. Portion size was generous for the price. Good choice!  Hawaiian snapper with asparagus ($25) was good, but not a good value. Portion size was really tiny. Probably wouldn't order this again.  We ordered a sparkling cucumber drink. It was okay, but not special.  Overall, nice spot to eat, especially if you order correctly. Kinda pricey, but food quality is high.",

Highlights include an amazing Caesar salad with a delightful Lemon Anchovy dressing. The flatbreads are very good, we've had several different ones and I can't say which was my favorite. The Beef Filet on crostini with Blue Cheese was also excellent.  The wine and beer selection rocks and this is a really dark, but trendy spot to hang out with friends or with a romantic interest.

We ordered the bacon, quail egg and fontina flat bread, which was deliciousssss. Half of our table ordered the sliced sirloin steak with mushroom fondue for the main course.

The low-light and decor is intimate but at the same time is good for a group. The bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese fondue was a different twist and the crab lettuce wraps were perfect for a lighter choice. The chorizo-andouille flatbread was very good-if you don't like spicy just ask for the red pepper flakes to be left off. I enjoyed the 3 bean salad, an updated classic that was such a nice change in a salad choice. We ended the meal with a selection of 3 cheeses and a gelato sampler that was a lovely ending. They have a wide selection of wines and beer lovers will not be disappointed due to a inventory. Service was fast and helpful.",

The waiter was very knowledgeable and had superb recommendations. I told him what kind of wine I liked and he chose the perfect one that satisfied my palate. The food is yummy and inventive - The Charizo flatbread had a lovely crust and a perfect balance of cheese to meat to sauce ratio. The Cheese board was great with the honey and toasted bread. My only complaint was the Smores Flatbread - I was not a huge fan of the flavor and found the crust to be more pizza -like then graham cracker which was not the most welcoming flavor. It is a neat concept, just for me, needs a bit of tweaking with the consistency and flavor of the crust. All in All though a fantastic, creative, and relaxing place.",

I was expecting dinner to take 2 hours  especially for a large party of 10, but we were in and out in 1 hour.  Everything was good, we ordered the lamb T-bone, sirloin steak, ceviche, hamachi, andouille flatbread, but my favorites of the evening were the beef carpaccio, mushroom grits, and diver sea scallops. The beef carpaccio is AMAZING! melt in your mouth, truffle seasoned beefy deliciousness.  The grits were creamy and rich, also truffle seasoned. The diver sea scallops were fresh, large, and cooked perfectly so they were still tender and succulent.  This is the perfect place to go to get that nice stomach lining before a night on the strip that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "WOW! After a lengthy drive through a wind and sand storm (LA to Vegas), we were ready for some fine dining and cocktails! We made a reservation through the Open Table App for 9pm, and although we arrived a bit early, the hostess found a lovely table for us in the \"lounge\". Tip: If you can request seating in the lounge or outdoor patio, both dining areas seemed to be a bit nicer than the area next to the bar. You may, however, need your iphone flashlight to get a better view of the menu items, as it is quite dark (romantic vibes) in all of the dining areas. We were greeted by our server almost immediately, who provided us an extensive overview of the menu (some of her favorite plates, and also the \"most popular\" items). She advised that all items are intended to be shared, and come out as they are ready (instead of coming in a particular order, i.e. appetizer, then salad, then entree). As we looked over the menu and made our decisions, I ordered a dirty martini with stuffed olives, and my boyfriend ordered a craft beer. I was definitely intrigued and tempted by their wine flight selection (they have multiple options that include reds, whites, and the \"Somm Selection\" (2 reds, 2 whites)), but was in the mood for a cocktail as it was my first beverage of the night.  We ordered the Crispy Ahi Tuna to start, which was way more delicious than anticipated (5 semi-thick slices of high quality tuna which a crispy, thin layer of fried deliciousness). Yum! Then we indulged in the Beef Filet, Crostini, Blue Cheese, Truffle Cream (two 2 ounce cuts of tender, perfectly prepared, melt in your mouth slices). Would definitely order again. We finished the meal with a flatbread (Fiery Artichoke, Pepperoncini, Olives, Ricotta) - which was recommended by our server. A bit spicy - the ricotta was my favorite part. We would have looked over the dessert menu, but the items we ordered were quite filling! It was the perfect amount of food for us to share (and trust me, we arrived hungry...).  Although I came into the experience expecting a decent meal with above average ambiance (as there are so many great options when dining in Vegas)- I was truly impressed with our experience. The service was great (both our server and her support staff), the beverage selection was on point, the food definitely deserives 5 stars, and the ambiance dark and romantic. I left with a smile on my face, and would definitely come back, whether it's with my boyfriend or a group of girlfriends!",

We loved the cornflake crusted french toast, the pancakes, the veal short rib beef hash, the egg sandwiches, the chilled tomato shooters, the flatbread, the tater tots and the eggs benedict with filet. Now ... they also have bottomless select alcoholic beverages for the incredibly economically friendly (especially for Wynn) price of $20. These drinks include mimosas, sangrias, bloody marys, mojitos and margaritas.   The total bill was $136 and with tip it came to $165. I regret nothing and neither will you.",

    "text": "Cool atmosphere although somewhat dark inside and 2 top tables are pretty close together.  Ok wine selections- wish they had more Cali wines like la crema Chardonnay or Justin Cabernet. We ordered cake bread Chardonnay ( only available in half bottle) which of course was awesome. Wish they had the cake bread Sauvignon blanc too.  We ordered:  Gorgonzola salad (best item we had), great flavors absolutely delicious. Nice balance with prosciutto and decent portion size.  Diver scallops on top of polenta cake. Scallops were cooked well but over seasoned, polenta was under seasoned and had more of a tator tot feel to it than a polenta feel. Wasn't our fave. It's hard to put almost anything with a scallop because it's so good on its own.  Filet crostini: absolutely wonderful. Blue cheese with perfectly cooked tender filet was to die for. 2nd favorite item  Flatbread special (pulled pork, Gouda). Least favorite item. I don't think the flatbreads are quite dialed in yet. Crust was too thick, didn't taste freshly made, sauce was too sweet and overall flatbread had one note flavor. Would have liked to see thinner crust with more meat and more distinct layering of toppings instead of everything mixed together and then baked.  All staff extremely friendly and great service.",

Baby kale salad was actually arugula - must have run out of kale - but nonetheless, it was lovely.  Perfect amount of dressing. Crisp apples were a great complement to the greens and the dressing.   Scallops were prefect.  Perfectly seasoned (just salt), with a good amount of butter and seared to perfection. Well done. The pollenta was too salty, but it had a great creamy texture.   Mushroom flatbread w ricotta was great.   Sirloin - nice cut but overcooked.  The waitress did not ask our preference for cooking [would have been medium rare] and we found this medium cooked sirloin too dry.  But I don't regret getting it; the presentation was great and its accompaniments were excellent.",

The restaurant is sexy and dark....hard to read your menu dark, but that's ok.  The vibe is lounge, with an extraordinary wine list.  Everything on the menu looks amazing.  It was hard to choose, but we finally settled on the sausage flatbread, pesto cream pasta and the hamachi.  All were incredible, flavorful and fresh.  I was surprised how spicy and perfect the flatbread was, only because pizza crust can be tricky at a restaurant that isn't really a pizza place.  We skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that.  Service started great.  As the night went on, the server became more absent and we finally had to stop a random waiter to get the check.  I plan on coming back.  For drinks or dinner, it's a great place to go with a group or a date.",

Charley Palmer at South Coast PLaza was the 1st   La Cave at the Wynn is the 2nd.  We had a meal that was stunning as well as excellent.  Take your whiny big portion attitude and hit the road - please.  Small services,...wonderful seating, great food,..  We had so much fun eating the food we did not order any wine,..but we sat next to the wine cellar and it was well stocked.  Had bacon wrapped dates with a blue cheese fondue,..yes i know what u r thinking - so I was,..but holy freekn amazing,..the different flavors of the three items was stunning.  We then had the Ahi,....ahhhhh ahi,.. still one of my fave foods to eat when done well,..this was - with some pom and a vinigrette and basil oil.  wonderful  Then we had this flat bread with very delicious canadian bacon and quail eggs,..yeah i know,....but seriously -- this flat bread dish was really really really good,..I could see having a wonderful brut champagne - and just this flat bread,..my gawd it was to die for,...I am not going to add quail egg to my regular dishes at home.  Last dish we had was thin sliced sirloin with baby mushrooms and stuff, Yes it was good and tasted like it was supposed to,...but of all my dishes it was my least fav,...we did go through almost 2 liters of sparkling water - again ,..well chilled and they kept my glass full at all times.  Now,..for those who like a drink,... and who are demanding on a well made drink,..and none of that crap stuff,..  I ordered a standard mojito - it we well muddled,..and perfectly mixed,..and it was a good sized glass too,,..lordy I hate those served in a micro tom collins glass or something,,..this was served well with sugar cane and plenty of mint and lime,..the way it is supposed to be.  I did not take pictures of the food here as it was soo perfect and wonderful that i expect you to go in and enjoy this place before everyone else knows about it and it becomes a reservation only place,..  We ate at around 7 pm and the line was slow - but by 8:30 the place was packed. Packed - crazy packed.  Loved the place,..the staff and the food as well as the seating,...yeah the chair was so special - lol seriously a great seat in a resturant is one of my high points --nothing sucks more than a chair u cant wait to get out of.  Okay I talked enough,,,get ur ass to La Cave - Hurry before it is too late.",

    "text": "Maybe because it was brunch, but the butler passed food just wasn't that great.  Lots of greasy breakfast items.  Lacked sophistication and the food felt overly simplified.  For example just serving bacon strips in a cup - they didn't wrap it and do anything to it that warranted a chef to create.  Sliders, scrambled eggs, tomato-mozzarella caprese, yogurt parfait ... Same thing.  They were all too dumbed down.  Why pay so much for something assembled rather than chef inspired.  Only a couple dishes were more complex like the short rib with eggs and flatbread.  But really, is flatbread that exotic these days?  For the most part, it felt like cafeteria food in a nice setting and served at the table.  Maybe the fact that it was the only restaurant at the Wynn on a Sunday morning with no line and plenty of seats.   That should've told us something.  Live and learn.",

The plates are all pretty small so definitely do family style. They also have a sommelier and a great wine selection so take advantage of that too if you like wining and dining.   Out of the small plates, my favorite has got to be the sliders. They were so delicious! The flatbread pizzas were good too, esp the ones with the quail eggs, which was very interesting and first time seeing that on a pizza. The hamachi was also good as well. The desserts were also super delicious, with the chocolate toffee covered donut ice cream bars and chocolate mousse!   Because the restaurant is pretty small, there could be a wait, esp if you want to go to the bar area and chill. But I definitely recommend this place esp if you're staying at the Wynn!",

It wasn't the restaurants fault these people were so obnoxious, but it impacted our feelings about La Cave.  We had the mini Angus burgers, meatballs, steak & mushroom flatbread and a couple of Pinot Noir wine flights.    The mini burgers were excellent (I would recommend getting the chipotle mayo on the side - the chipotle is really strong (and I like Chipotle!))  The flatbread was decent.  The meatballs were good, but the burgers were the star.  I might go back to this place if I could pick a table away from any obnoxious drunk people (maybe when the weather is better sitting on the patio is nice?)",

The price is reasonable but remember it's tapas style so you'll get little bites so it's fun to share with a group of friends. Nothing bad I can say about the place. For four of us we end up ordering six dishes bill was about $80  If I get to do it again I wouldn't order beef cappachio very small portion... the classic way is to lay thinly slice of beef flat, a little dressing, and choice of micro green. This way there are plenty of raw meat ( 16 - 28 slices on a plate). The best one I had was at Chaya in Beverly Hill. La Cave only served four thinly slices, rolled up with sauce.   You should order:  Crab lettuce wrap Angus beef slider Pizza with quail eggs on it Belgium beer.",

I felt like I was trapped at a really bad country club somewhere in the midwest.   We were going to see the Phantom, and wanted a snack before the play, but not a full meal, so we chose the Cave. From the moment we approached the hostess, the place felt awkward.  Our hostess could not find a table, and sent for a fellow worker, who checked the rooms, but could not locate a table.  Several people just walked in past us, which was curious, then another hostess arrived, who said maybe we could sit on the patio.  Fine, it had been too cold and windy to sit there all day, but would we like to sit there?   Sounds, er, great. We were led through three rooms, each with several empty tables seats amid the sparrows on a small outdoor balcony overlooking people being told to leave the pool, because it was too cold.  I sat shiverring in my faux fur vest, happy I had dressed for the cold Phantom theater. The waitress was very nice, and our orders arrived prompty.  Tapas is my new obsession, so I was delighted with the selection, but the dates were a bit overdone, and the chicken rolls were also dry.  The most fun I had was feeding the little sparrows who darted about delightedly.   I would give the place another try another day.",

After letting our waiter know we wanted to do the a la carte brunch it took about 10 minutes to get our first dish even though the table two from us and the large party in the center had been served at least 3 times during that time. I saw our waiter direct him to us. That should have been our sign to bail. It was that way the remainder of our time there. At one point we had a couple seated next to us so I thought perhaps we would finally receive some attention but sadly we were alternatively ignored. It's not good when your customers are sitting there long enough without food to talk about how bad service is. Needless to say, I won't be back especially since nothing we were served was spectacular.",

They offer wine flights that features 5 kinds of wines in each flight and the cost ranges from $20-$35.  You don't get a lot of each wine though so they probably add up to a little more than a glass of wine.   The waiter came over and told us that their food is tapas and sharing style and the portions are small so you'd need about 2-3 dishes per person.  HE LIED.  The portions are good size actually.  Depends on what you order, say the flat bread pizza is enough to feed one person, and so is the pasta.   The food itself is very tasty and nicely prepared though.  We ordered a side of truffled fries ($5) and it's the yummiest fries I've ever had.  Their shaved ham with quail egg pizza ($18) is also fantastic.  Not sure if it's good enough for me to return given so many great restaurants in Vegas, but it was an enjoyable meal for sure.",

It's a great place to go if you've never had them. They had some traditional ones (dates wrapped in bacon; but they added a twist with a side of blue cheese fondue which I was surprisingly happy about) and they have some new age ones (crab filled lettuce wraps; soooooo good. I devoured them like they were my last meal on earth and didn't care who was watching. Judge me people, judge me!)   We also ordered the angus burgers (nothing special, but good), and prosciutto and arugula flatbread (too die for, the saltiness was so satisfying) and a bottle of wine.  The decor was awesome. Try and sit in the back; they have romantic lounge styled sitting. Too fun!  Our server was really nice and cute, BUT girl... you gotta come back and keep pouring the wine into our glasses if you want to follow proper restaurant etiquette.

    "text": "I really enjoyed this place and would recommend if asked about places to go in Vegas.  It is intimate and unique.  There are 3 sections:  You walk into a round low ceilinged bar area with some seating, then you walk back further there is a high ceiling dining room with wine all the way up to the top, then to the right there is a lounge room with couches, weird furniture and a beautiful view out large wall of windows.  We sat in the lounge on a comfy couch.  The lighting is all candlelit.  The lounge reminds me slightly of a less ostentatious Parker Palm Springs.  Menu is small plates with a few larger entrees.  Portions are very small, but food is delicious. (bacon dates, beet salad, cheese and charcuterie plates, etc.) They aren't calling it a gastropub, but it is.    The have a large artisan beer selection and tons of wine.  Even the pricey highly specialized enomatic wines.  The vibe with soft reggae and jazz with some bass with the atmosphere was awesome.  I was thinking the lounge would be a perfect place to snuggle, smooch and nosh with a love, but unfortunately I was with my mom, oh well ;)",

    "text": "I came here with a friend during her birthday weekend. We thought it was absolutely delicious! We had the veal short rib cavatelli pasta, the bacon and quail egg flatbread, the scallops and the Beignets. The cavatelli pasta was our favorite!!! It was to DIE for and melted in your mouth. The only negative thing was the size. It was pretty small but also very rich that a larger portion might have been overkill. The flatbreads were a great sharing portion. And the bacon quail egg was a great combo! The scallops were ok, nothing memorable, though they were nice and large. And the beignets lacked flavor. We should've gotten the crem brulee, though I heard mixed reviews with the mint thrown in. The other great thing is the price. Very, very affordable for Vegas. PLUS great location in the Wynn. Nice spot to hit up before you head out to XS, Surrender, or Tryst!",

Our server, Matt, was also extremely attentive, funny and quick! The service overall here was very quick - even though we had 9 girls, we were out of there easily in 1.5 hours.   Some of my favorites however include (but note, there really wasn't anything that I disliked):  * hamachi with jalapenos - SO refreshing & crisp! (small portion) * crab/lobster lettuce wrap * flatbreads - both the artichoke & the bacon/egg were delicious * bacon wrapped dates   All in (including tax & tip), ended up being $60 / person (this is excluding alcohol).  They also have various wine flights (4) available ranging from $15-25.",

My whole group would agree that once seated we were disapointed with the service from our waiter he suggested the Chef's Tasting menu($45each) due to the size of our party we all thought that was reasonable but one of the members of our group has a food allergy to mushrooms and 3 of the six items contained mushrooms, when asked to substitute our waiter acted offended and told them \"to eat around the mushrooms\". We opted out of the tasting menu after the comment was made and ordered some delicious items like the Crab Lettuce Wraps, Pesto Pasta, Asparagus with egg, Flat Breads and other items. The service improved with the evening sadly once they realized we would possibly be repeat customers and after talking to the sommelier about the waiters personality . The bill was over $850 for tapas, dessert, cava toast and wine(2 @bottles at $70each). Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was great.",

Regardless, La Cave is a big time winner in my book. I ate a late lunch here with my brother and we were seated on the outside patio with a nice view of the pool and since it was a beautiful day in Vegas, this was a nice touch. Everything on the menu sounded quite good, but there are definitely two must try's, the angus mini burgers and the prosciutto flatbread, while both were great, the angus mini burgers were outstanding and completely melted in your mouth... those are a dish that I have since craved and will order again when I return to Vegas next month. We also had a salad and the jumbo lump crab lettuce cups and those were also quite good, but if we could have substituted two more orders of the mini burgers for those two dishes, we would have done it in a second. The service was very good and the atmosphere was lively and La Cave seems like the perfect place for a lunch before or after a day at the Encore Beach Club.",

With so many amazing options to choose from in Vegas I chose the same place ? I used to live and work in Vegas so i do know the city fairly well despite its changing scene. The wine list speaks for its self. Amazing and affordable. The food was spot on. I believe I ate through what felt like most of the menu. I must admit that the kitchen did have a bit of smoke rolling out from the hoods when they cooked ....but this was just part of the show and aI quickly got over it. The staff seemed down to earth. I dined alone each time, so for them to come over and \"check up on me\" in a very sincere way was a nice touch. Each time I looked around the packed room and happen to make eye contact with a staff member, they said hello. Something being from Chicago myself, I'm used to  but not used to seeing in Vegas. The chef (I saw his name and picture on my TV screen in my room) delivered my food! Nice touch. The room , food and service seems very down to earth, giving me and it a comfortable vibe with character. Something I don't find in Vegas all the time. I loved it. Unfortunately I will not being staying at Wynn my next planned visit this spring. But I will def go back to get those bacon wrapped dates !",

This was sooooooooooooooo good I can just only eat this. Must order more stuff with eggs from now on.

Because of Yelp reviews, we ended up at La Cave. We got right in at around 8 pm on a Saturday night. A lot of the dishes are tapas style, so we each got a small salad and a few things to share. I got the gorgonzola salad and it was AWESOME. The cheese combined with prosciutto was fantastic! I thought it was going to be super small but it was a pretty decent size. We got a couple flatbreads to share - the tomato, mozz and caper and the artichoke, roasted pepper and olives. I wouldn't LOVED the tomato and mozz but the capers kind of threw it off for me. The drinks are also pretty yummy. Four of us probably spent $40 bucks each, which for a trendier place in Vegas is pretty darn good. Would definitely come back.",

Portions are quite small by any tapas standard.  Not a particularly big eater, but if you think about what you need to order to feel reasonably satisfied the price of your meal quickly shoots up to a range where you could for the same price go to a more upscale restaurant and leave more satisfied.  So although the food is good, if I compare to comparably priced alternatives I would rate La Cave below average.",

Service once we were seated was very good as well.  We opted to sit at the counter next to the display kitchen.  This turned out great for us, as the chef in charge of the flatbreads noticed that one of the ones intended for us was instead delivered to another table.  He quickly let us know that he was making us another one while passing a complimentary plate of bacon-wrapped figs around the partition.  Really above and beyond the level of service I normally expect at LV hotel restaurants, even at a hotel like the Wynn.  One complaint was with the hostess.  We stopped in early (no reservation) when the place was nearly empty and noted that we just wanted to grab a quick round of drinks and appetizers.  Before seating us, she went through this whole process of getting our full names and whether we were staying at the hotel.  Struck me as completely unnecessary and rather ridiculous - they should really do away with it.",

Knowing that it was our first time there he didn't really take the time to explain all the menus that were given to us or take the time to suggest any of the popular dishes. We ordered the charcuterie board my husband asked the runner for a different bread options and he told us he would check with the chef. As he walked away we asked Ralph if there was a alternative option besides the bread chips they gave us and he said NO. Well there was! Just laziness if you ask me. Not trying to accommodate us and guess what? The restaurant was empty. He had prob 3 tables max. The food was amazing though. Good eats and good price. The only time we saw a manager was when he quickly came by the table to take the check book and cash us out. Didn't even take the time to ask us how everything was....fine dinning at its finest!

Beyond the obvious brilliance of being able to share, I love to try many different things, particularly at a new place.  La Cave is small plates, and it is great.  On to the food in a minute, but I have to relate my wife's experience.  She has several food allergies and sensitivities, including gluten, and we typically get mixed reactions when we ask what they recommend.  The chef at La Cave went above and beyond.  After a little bit of back and forth on what could be done with our server, we got the message \"the chef would like to do something special for you\".  We agreed, and he came out to talk with us after we ordered.  Extremely friendly, extremely attentive, great service.  The topper was the food they brought, which was simple, expertly prepared, and absolutely delicious.  My wife had a version of the Salt-Roasted Beets (which may have been the best beets I've ever had) and a version of the Grilled Shrimp (which she thought was the best shrimp she's had) and some terrific grilled Asparagas.  Did I mention absolutely delicious?   I also had the Bacon-wrapped Dates with Bleu Cheese Fondue and the Ham, Egg and Cheese Flatbread (with quail eggs).  The Dates were fantastic, and the flatbread quite good (and a bit rich).  The food was so hot when served I took notice - it felt like they took it off the grill to our table in just a few seconds.  In a couple square miles of many, many food options, La Cave was worth repeating on a single trip.  And the service put them over the top.  I wish I could go back right now.  I've written myself hungry.",

They kind of stopped coming around after a while and I probably would've eaten a few bites more.  Although that was probably a good idea as I would have eaten too much otherwise!",

In fact, La Cave is the ONLY restaurant we ever visited twice in the same Las Vegas vacation. Our server, Beverly, was delightful.  Very knowledgeable and helpful, but not pushy.  The three meat flatbread was fresh, well prepared and presented on a neat cutting board.  My wife is still talking about the wonderful charcuterie appetizer. On the second visit we tried several other tapas and were very satisfied.  The beef selection had a great taste, along with the blue cheese topping that is!",

I expected a great dining experience considering the reviews on here, and the price, but the dishes were hit or miss. The ambiance was nice, but I wouldn't recommend this place.  Hits:  The cheese sauce for the bacon wrapped dates was really good, making it different The sirloin dish was delicious, especially the onion and mushrooms  Misses: The flat bread was pizza...not what we were expecting for a Spanish inspired restaurant The ahi tuna was bland and nothing special",

It's good for dates because the portions are decent so you get to taste some yummy food without getting full. Nice glass of wine or two and you'll be enjoying everything else as well.  The highlight of our meal was definitely the pizza with chorizo. I could have ordered 3 more of them and kept eating because it was that good. Service was attentive and polite. They screwed up our wine order and sent it to the table next to us, but the staff quickly cleared things up and I was enjoying my nice warm buzz by the end.  We were fortunate enough to sit right in front of the kitchen, so we got to see how hard the chefs work to get the food out. It's like sitting at a bar, but with the kitchen cooking right in front of us as we ate. I got to say, they work hard. It was also great to see that they took the affair of cooking seriously and were concentrating on producing a great meal every time.   Overall, a great experience. The food is thoughtful and creative. The flavors are, in my estimation, meant to be paired with wine. Even if they're not, definitely get a glass because the food and wine definitely complement each other.",

Anyways, the important stuff, the food.  I will be honest,there were 10 of us, we ordered the menu pretty much, everything, yes everything was great, it's rare (as you will know if you've read my reviews) for me not to have a negative about one thing, this is one of those places.  There were a couple of standout dishes.  The jumbo lump crab lettuce rolls......OMG, a perfectly balanced crab dish The star of the night and maybe the best dish I have eaten this year.....  The Bacon and Egg Fettuccine, Prosciutto Sunny Side Egg    If you get to eat one dish in Vegas, make it this, my taste buds loved me for this dish.  Great service, the total bill was not bad considering the amount of food and wine ordered (less than the following night at Giada) the only negative, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars, the diet coke remained empty for lengths of time, I know it sounds stupid, but a glass of diet coke cost the restaurant a penny, there is no reason for it to sit empty, especially considering the service was good.",

Filet and blue cheese flatbread: Also delicious Thai-Basil chicken flatbread: Great but not if you don't like sweet and spicy together- as one in our party mentioned. Salmon sashimi tostada: Very good  For our \"main course\" we got the Angus mini burgers, beef filet with blue cheese crostini and the sea scallops.

The stuffed chicken was highly disappointing. It was dry and lacking in flavor. Unfortunately, this was the last thing we ordered.  The space is intimate but cozy.

There were already a bunch of people there (older crowd) and we ended up getting the best table on the patio overlooking the pool.  The good: Tapas like plates, many were basic, so if you have people in your party that don't go out of the box, this might be for them as much as you. A few different civeche's which were really good, and great selection of different dishes. Mushroom grits were a big hit.  The meh: Limited drink menu, boring cocktails, maybe the wine was better, but we're not wine drinkers. Some dishes were way too basic, the sliders at $15, thats a lot for three basic little burgers.  Conclusion: It was good, not terribly expensive, but not cheap either. I'd recommend it as one of the places you go in the area, but not my top pick.",

However, the meal and the service, in particular, were very disappointing. My husband and I both enjoy tapas style dining because the dishes are usually well seasoned and we can eat a variety of interesting foods. Of the four dishes we ordered, only one wowed us and that was the steak filet. The other 3 were ordinary and not special in any way, the recommended dates wrapped in bacon were not good.  The worst part was the service. Our primary waitress talked so fast that we needed her to repeat everything 2 or 3 times. Then a second waitress was trying to buss the dishes and wine glasses before we had finished eating and drinking from them. We managed to prevent her from taking anything we still wanted and I finally told her we were being rushed - it wasn't as if we were lingering over anything or that there weren't empty tables about. After that, the first waitress returned and pointedly asked if she could remove something every time - not sure if she was being sarcastic or just officious. We skipped dessert not wanting to press our luck.  The atmosphere was OK, a little noisy, tables close together, and dark with many hard surfaces and not enough sound absorbing materials in use. That was the least of our issues and in some ways it could be considered attractive but it in no way compared to the rest of the Wynne.",

In a city well known for scantily clad women, La Cave still manages to outdo itself.  And, oh yeah ... the restaurant.  The almost-tapas style menu means that you're going to order a lot of finger food style dishes that are tasty. How exactly they come together as a meal depends on whether you carefully select each dish or simply order a smorgasbord ... but either way, the food was delicious, if not pricey. But this is Vegas, after all.  And did I mention the girls who greet you at the front of the restaurant?",

    "text": "We decided to stop in to La Cave for a small early dinner before our red eye flight back east.  We chose this spot because I read that they did small plates and it seemed somewhat tapas style.  While the place certainly isn't Spanish tapas, but they did have a nice mix to choose from.  We went with the 3 meat and 3 cheese board for about $35.  Upon first impression I thought this was insanely expensive, but in reality they gave us a ton of meat and cheese.  It ended up being a full meal for the two of us plus a smores pizza for dessert (amazing).  Drink wise, they were expensive but on par for Vegas.  As for the decor, I thought it was a pretty cool looking restaurant.  The back room was dark and definitely set up to host small or large parties.  They also had a nice covered back deck area to eat outside.  It was a little too warm for the outside when we went, but I could see that being a good place to hang.  As for the service, it was a little slow in the beginning, but our waitress was very nice.",

This are just few of their delish treats that we salivated:  Fiery Artichoke, Roasted Pepper, Olives Flatbread Chorizo, Italian & Andouille Sausage Flatbread Mixed Greens oven-roasted tomatoes, grilled onions, shaved goat cheese Sliced Sirloin Steak And their wine selection are quite a stellar.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

    "text": "Grits!... order them period.   This review is long overdue since i have been back here many times for so many different reasons. La Cave is considered the food & wine hideaway and it kind of fits the feel when walking in past the entry cave where they have high tables to enjoy a glass of wine or appetizers and then past this to pen up to a formal style dining room complete with a gorgeous patio that opens up to a gorgeous night. The feel is a little more upbeat and hip with music playing and a diverse setup of tables and chairs to chose from to sit at. If you have the option try to find yourself sitting on the patio with a good glass of wine.   I have had  Grits - Oh God... thats all but eat while hot and dont be shy and let them get cold because its such a waste.  Filet and caramelized onion flatbread with blue cheese - A very nice combination of ingredients on a very generous sized flat bread. If you are a blue cheese lover then this is a must.  Bacon wrapped dates - A great stater and these are winner on many tapas menus but from here happen to be my favorite (far better than firefly) Sea scallops - Although these were well prepared i can say that i could pass on these. Then again i am not a scallop guy so if you love scallops then you may like more than i.  Beef filet crostini - The biggest surprise of the menu for me, so simple yet so delicious and so well put together. I could eat just this all night with the right glass of wine.   Chloe is the sommelier here and is good at what she does. Ask for her assistance with your wine and she will not disappoint with something from their extensive list. Her smile and appreciation for her customers aids in a terrific dining experience. Actually the entire staff here has always been attentive and welcoming as ill continue to return for excellent meals deep into the future.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place... hmmph oh wells my search continues for a nice hideaway.   Food:  Sliced Sirloin Steak: 2/5 Our waitress continuously reminded my table when we ordered our food would come out the order it was made. We said that's fine but when I got my order the sauce was very cold and so was the cut. BUT the plate was definitely heated, I ended up getting it sent back and the chef offered a free desert and his apologies.  Veal: 4/5 was very hard to slice through, maybe it was my knife but I swear it was definitely but it was very delicious, soaked in a pomegranate reduction, on top of a bed of veggies.  Chefs selection Thai Sweet Basil Flat bread: 4/5 very delicious, not too sweet and the flat bread was very soft yet also crispy.   Desert: 4/5 S more's Flat bread courtesy of the Chef for sending out a cold order of sliced sirloin Steak. It was very delicious. I love the dough they use for their flat breads. Very soft and it complimented the chocolate well.    Wine: 4/5 $70 bottle of La Sala Chianti Classico $70, Great Wine, very light and refreshing. I thought buying a bottle would've been a better deal than buying mutilple wines by the glass. Happy we picked this bottle.  Service: 2/5 Personally I think our waitress just forgot about us. She mixed up our order and forgot to order our desert. Well at least she had the balls to come over and apologize that she forgot and the chef offered a free desert.   Ambiance: 4/5 Great atmosphere, I loved the decor. Very modern, dimmed lighting, if you get seat on the patio they have big windows over looking the wynn garden or the waterfall. Very elegant.",

White sangria = bliss.  Beignets (donut-hole variety) for dessert.   We went twice this past trip. The only minor complaint was being seated in the bigger, outer room our second visit (perhaps there was a party going on?). The low seats/banquette were cute but oh, so uncomfortable.   La Cave is one of the main reasons I like the Wynn.",

They have a large gluten free menu and most items on the menu can be prepared gluten free, you just have to ask. The food was excellent I can't say I had a dish that I'd say I would not order again. Everything was made fresh to order and I loved watching make it at the open kitchen. I recommend ordering three tapas plates per person since I feel even for tapas the portions are on the small side. The only negative about this establishment is that there are TVs all over the place any it takes away from the beautiful ambiance and decor. In my opinion the TVs cheapen the vibe here and should be removed.",

    "text": "Went here for a belated birthday/last unhealthy hurrah dinner. My husband and I are currently obsessed with tapas bars. We have very different tastes in food so if you are like us, this is the place for you. All the portions are small plates and they are arranged by type of food on the menu. If you are adverse to seafood, like my husband, you can just avoid that section of the menu entirely. You order things as you go and eat them as they come out. A very casual way to dine. But at La Cave, the environment is more elevated. A great contrast in my opinion.   We sat on the patio, which was a bit chilly this time of the year. But once the heaters were on it was lovely. You have a nice view of the courtyard and part of the pool area. If you prefer to sit inside they have a room that is entirely windows so you can pretend you like the outdoors without actually having to endure them. Win/win.   The service was amazing, but this is a Vegas restaurant in the Wynn, I would expect nothing less.   The food was delicious. I loved everything I tried. Some of my \"must orders\" are the truffle mushroom grits, the beet and burrata salad, and the Mexican street corn flatbread. Yes it is better than it sounds.   Their wine list is a book, so if you love wine from all over creation, this is the place for you. They also have a variety of flights, which is fun.   I definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere as well as the food is perfect for a quiet date night, or a fancy friend's night out.",

So while staying at the Wynn on our honeymoon we decided this would be our last Vegas meal before heading home. We ordered the browned butter sage gnocchi, bean and avocado salad, and tomato and mozzarella flat bread. Overall the food had ZERO flavor. I am unsure if they even have salt or pepper shakers in the kitchen, there were none on the table. Typically the lack of salt and pepper on the table is indicative of a good meal perfectly seasoned to come. NOPE.The gnocchi was sweet. Like dessert sweet. Even disgustingly sweet for a dessert. The gnocchi portion was rather pathetic with a whopping 10 gnocchi for $18. The flatbread completely lacked flavor. It was just canned tomatoes thrown onto a very basic pizza dough with tiny lumps of mozzarella and capers scattered over the top. The bean and avocado salad was a generous portion but had less avocado in it than a 6\" subway sub. It was 50% fried garbanzo beans which became overwhelming. The ice wine vinegarette was not even detectable.  The service was good but we left there feeling exceptionally dissatisfied and wishing we'd just gone to White Castle.",

The service was solid and the ambiance was nice; as to be expected for the Wynn Hotel.  The prices were high, also to be expected at the Wynn.    We ordered some wine and a couple small plates, as this was the concept.  I'm usually hesitant on small plates, as they just give you a smaller portion, yet still charge you for an entree portion.  It seems to be the trend in the Northwest and west coast, as well as a lot of the bigger cities.    For our food, we had the scallop ceviche to start with, which was very good!  We then tried the French onion soup that was solid; it was served with puff pastry o top that was perfectly browned and crispy.  Then we decided to try the crab lettuce wraps, which were probably the only weak choice we made.  The waiter recommended them, but we weren't impressed.  They were just lump crab meat with a mayo based sauce that was very bland.    Over all it was a nice dinner, but would never pay those prices if I wasn't in Las Vegas.  It's really sad how overpriced it's become...",

I don't recall if an a la carte option was available while at brunch but their format worked fine for us.   There is a set menu of items that come out to tables, almost dim sum style. That is, they bring a plate of fresh, easy bite items that you can have or pass on. The ones we tried were very good and options did come back around in case you miss something or want more of a specific item.  I imagine you can ask for something to come back too although we didn't. I believe this cost $45 per person. There was also a bottomless mimosa option for $29 along with other cocktail choices. All said, a good start to the morning and trip.",

You are certainly welcome to charge your meals here to your room, but will NOT be covered when you settle your bill! The Wynn even lists all of these restaurants in their Wynn restaurant guide - and the restaurant doesn't clue you in either. This feels like bait & switch!

During the winter they put a wall up where there would be an outdoor pool view, which makes it feel a little more closed in, but during the summer it feels like a huge patio! Now the salads and pizzas here are unreal, which is what they are known for! However, this past time I went, I decided to try a few other things and man my mouth is watering thinking about it all over again! The short rib tacos are a MUST. The service was relatively good, but they were packed during lunch time which could be the reason for this. Our waitress was very honest about what she did and did not like which was great. However, all the waitresses were dressed very skimpy in cocktail waitress attire as if they were on a casino floor which was a little off putting just because it did not quite make sense for a nice restaurant! The lighting is a bit dark in the winter, but great during the summer. At night, the whole place is really dark, but still well worth your time. It is tapas style so everything is made to share, and the prices are very reasonable- especially for being a restaurant at the Wynn. Such a must try!",

    "text": "As a Frenchman, I rarely expect to be blown away by the food in the US.   This is one of the rare cases where I was blown away by the food, service and the location.   For the location, we sat on the terrace, on a large table (a group of 6), with a view on the internal garden of Wynn, Venetian, and the High Roller. All lighting in the night, the view was magnificent and blended/contrasted amazingly with the internal decoration of the restaurant, made in the style of an old European cellar.  Next, for the service - it was timely, diligent and the wine advisor suggesting pairings of foods with wines was competent and on point.   Now, the last, but definitely not the least - the food. It was amazing. I've never tried a skirt steak that good. Sauce, cooking, and taste - all blended to an experience of a steak I have not experienced even in France, let alone in the US. Combined with the side dish of asparagus and other vegetable blends, the meal overall was absolutely amazing and definitely worth the price charged.  I couldn't recommend this place more. If there was a six-star option of Yelp, that would definitely be a candidate for such a grade.",

    "text": "This review is for Sunday BRUNCH:  We were sat outside at a table right under the sun. It was 105 degrees outside! I'm disappointed that we were not asked if we preferred inside or outside seating. I did ask for a different table and we were placed at a table that was in the shade on the other side of the same hall with a table that was no higher than our knees when we were sitting in chairs. Not a good thing if you're tall and most certainly not conducive for eating.  The good:  -fruit salad yummy -yogurt parfait yummy -small tomato puree soup yummy -heirloom tomato mozzarella caprese yummy ( two slices of tomatoes and one slice of mozzarella yet easy on balsamic!) -tomato mozzarella caprese flatbread( you get a very small piece so ask for a few if you like it) -scrambled eggs good - bacon good -angus mini burgers good (as per my friend, as I cannot eat mayonnaise and it already comes with mayonnaise with no option to ask for it without mayonnaise) -French toast with corn flakes good  The bad or not that great: -sausage disappointing -tater tots with gravy were not that great -veal short rib hash disappointing -pancakes were small and looked pitiful, not that great as supposed to have Snickers in it... no Snickers to be found! -waffle with cinnamon and apple very average. -mushroom truffle grits more cream than grits and underseasoned, as well as way too heavy. -bacon and egg flatbread was with ham, not bacon, and just ok - I was so looking forward to the lox and bagel, yet the bagels tasted stale. I was disappointed.  -coffee way too strong. I only tried half of one small cup, and left it there. It tasted more like an espresso.  - we had to ask for pastries and cookies, and for the quality, we might as well have bought them at Albertson's, your local supermarket. Not at all impressed. My friend called it a blast of sugar with no other flavor.   Never saw or got in time:  -La cave egg sandwich (they came by an hour and fifteen minutes later with these yet we lost our appetite by then!) -filet mignon with eggs Benedict ( came by one hour and a half later since our arrival!) This is what we were eager to try, and we could not believe that it was actually served an hour and a half after we got there and after we had eaten whatever we actually liked.   - waiter only asked, after 50 minutes of being there, what we still wanted to try. After telling him, 20 minutes later still nothing came out... we only asked for lox with bagel and French toast. -the table beside us had some lady taking pictures and they were bringing all the dishes to her table. The dishes looked flawless, and they do not look like that when they get to you. We were officially chopped liver, because that is the impression we were left with.   -There were one to three persons coming out with small dishes from the kitchen and they go from table to table and those dishes go fast with only a limited number at a time which is not enough to go around for all tables... what's worse, they do not have any more of that dish that your table did not get any of, as the kitchen only made a few and the other tables already grabbed them, and the kitchen is now making a fresh batch so it will be a while!!!  - The only thing that salvaged this restaurant from getting one star instead of three is that the manager was kind enough to be apologetic and even offered me his card, requesting that I call and make another reservation. Despite him being very kind, I am not interested in coming back. As a local and a hard-working professional, I do not have time to sit there and do nothing even when it's leisure. I am there because I'm hungry. This is not a place to come to if your hungry yet rather a place to come in order to waste your money and socialize. I also appreciated that the manager only charged us for one person rather than both, which was very appropriate for the amount of food that we did not eat, either because it never came or we didn't like it so we didn't eat it.   -I would have rather seen this be a buffet. I'm sure the restaurant would not agree, but I think it would have made a lot more sense. Overall, very disappointing experience and I do not plan on coming back nor recommending it to friends. Way too many other amazing places for brunch in Las Vegas that have better food and better service and overall just better experience.  -I did also know that the larger the party  or table was, the more attention they got and all food seemed to go their way first.  Tip: if you valet and spend over $50, have them validate your parking ticket so no parking fee  Sad... I have been here for dinner in the past and it was very good. I cannot say the same of brunch.",

I've been wanting to try La Cave since they opened but there has never been enough time or hunger to fit it in.   The ambiance here is akin to a dark, sexy underground bar in NYC. Something totally different than what you normally find in Vegas.  One thing that stood out was the full bar behind us!  They only provided us with a food & wine menu so I thought they didn't serve cocktails.. until I turned around & saw a full bar.  Everything here is tapas which was great since we weren't too hungry to begin with.  Standouts include the short ribs as well as the sea scallops on polenta & the beet & burrata salad. There were a bunch of other items that looked great so I'm sure I will be back on my next trip.",

    "text": "I was really disappointed in this place. I was so excited to try it, because as a vegan there aren't that many fancy restaurants to get excited about. So going on a business trip to Vegas meant that I go to try a Wynn restaurant (he went vegan and so all of his establishments now have vegan options). I went with some omnivores, and a friend who has a gluten allergy. On paper, this place was perfect-- fun and fancy for a night out, small plates so we can try a couple things each, and gluten-free, vegan, veg, and omnivore menus. My group was pretty large, maybe a dozen of us, and they seemed really flummoxed by that. They didn't want us each to place individual orders- they wanted us to order only things we wanted to share with the whole table. This just doesn't make sense for a restaurant that is catering to multiple kinds of diets. After a little bit of arguing with the waitress, she did let us all order our own things, but she told us not to expect them to come out at the same time. This meant that some people got two small plates before others even got one plate. And they forgot some of our drink orders, so we had to flag them down, which took a ridiculously long time given that they weren't very busy. And on top of that- all the food was disappointing- the omnis, the vegan, and the gluten-free-- all not exciting or worth the price really.   So I would try another Wynn restaurant if I am back in Vegas, but not this one.",

You definitely have to be a fan of Blue Cheese to truly appreciate it.. wash it down with a fun flight of wine and you can't go wrong.  Did I mention it was pretty reasonably priced?",

The day of the reservation I had to change the time, and again, no problem.  I was impressed by the decor when we walked in, it is like a little restaurant in Venice.  We were seated by the 'lake', the lighting was perfect, and the acoustics make for good conversation.  We ordered a bottle of French wine, a Gran Cru from Volnay.  The Sommelier came straight away with the bottle and appropriate glasses.  He was very knowledgable about the region, and also friendly without being too chatty.  We ordered a cheese and meat plate to compliment our delicious wine, which it did perfectly.  We only had appetizers as we were heading to a show and would be dining out later.  I regret that choice!  I wish we would have had our meal at The Cave!  The menu was full of good choices that I could pronounce and had some familiarity with.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "La Cave is located inside of the Wynn hotel. The restaurant serves small plates of food so that you can order a bunch of plates to share with your friends. It's best to dine in a group of 2-4 people because the plates are small and even though you can order multiple orders of the same dish it's still hard to pass everything around the table...or you can do what we did and split you table into different groups. We had a party of 8 but divided the table into two groups to make it easier to order, share food, and split the bill. We were advised by our waiter to order about two plates per person and it was the perfect amount of food.  Ahi Tuna (Pomegranate, Basil Oil) $15 - The ahi tuna was super fresh and the sauce was very flavorful. Hamachi (Pickled Chilies, Candied Lemon Zest) $15 - Again, the Hamachi was very fresh and the sauce was light but flavorful. I also liked the added spiciness from the chilies. Beef Carpaccio (Arugula, Truffle Aioli) $15 - I love truffle everything and the truffle aioli in this dish was delicious! Salt-roasted Beets (Whipped Goat Cheese, Pistachio) $10 - I loved the salt-roasted beets. The beets were sweet, the whipped goat cheese was rich and creamy, and the pistachio gave the dish a nice crunch. Shaved Asparagus (Hard Boiled Eggs, Pancetta) $10 - I loved all of the different textures in this dish...the crisp asparagus shavings, the soft egg whites, and the crunchy pancetta. Sliced Sirloin Steak (Mushroom Fondue, Cippolini Onions) $19 - The sliced sirloin steak was to die for. The meat was tender, the sauce was amazing, and the mushrooms and onions were super tasty. Diver Sea Scallops (Polenta Cake, Shrimp Sauce) $17 - The scallops were melt in your mouth delicious. I loved the polenta cake...it was soft and creamy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. Chef's Selection: Nueske's Bacon, Poached Quail Egg, Fontina Flatbread $14 - The bacon pretty much looked and tasted like ham. I liked the addition of the quail egg on top...it's something unexpected. The flatbread itself had a nice chewy texture and a nice crisp on the bottom.  Everything was really good...we ate every last morsel of food!  Including a bottle of wine and tip it came out to be a little more than $50 per person which is pretty reasonable for a nice dinner in Vegas. I would highly recommend this restaurant!  P.S. They also have a vegetarian/vegan menu! There was someone in our party that is a vegetarian and she thoroughly enjoyed the vegetarian dishes as well.",

I had a crisp white Vermentino which I love on hot days. It was refreshing with a sharp bite and faint aroma of fruit, but not quite as cold as I would have like it.  The food, on the other hand was awesome.  We tried two flatbread pizzas, the Fiery Artichoke, Roasted Pepper, Olives Flatbread [sweet and salty and light] and the Chorizo, Italian & Andouille Sausage Flatbread [meaty, smoky and rustic].  Both were quite different but great, esp. the crust. My faves were the beef carpaccio and salmon wontons....we even ordered more.  Definitely will go back to try more dishes.",

Decent wine list, not a lot of variety but what they do have is good.  Service isn't super quick but they do a good job of splitting the checks when you have a big group.  Reservations are recommended.  Without them, expect to wait nearly an hour.",

While waiting at the bar for my husband the bartender didn't say two words to me and the other bartender had a big frown on her face. Lots of large parties which mad the dining room very loud but we got outside on the patio at 8 pm no problem and it was only 1/2 full and the weather was glorious. The food was great (Gorgonzola Salad is fantastic) but it's been hard to order a glass of wine with dinner (*bar must take a while) and this has happened to me repeatedly.  We had better service than our last viist but it's quickly slipping off my radar but we do enjoy the atmosphere. I think we will try Jaleo in the Cosmo next time we want tapas.",

I've never been a fan of wine until i started pairing them with cheese and I was so glad that la cave had malbec!  my favorite choice of wine. They had goat cheese as well and many different varieties.  The ambiance was perfect, dim lighting and high ceilings and great staff.  We also ordered the beef carpaccio, chicken, and others i can't remember.  Not a full entree type of place but a great place to grab mini items for a night out.  who wants to stuff their face before drinking anyways? just so you can throw it back up later? ummmm no thanks.",

Service was not good.  Hostess first brings us to low rocking chairs and low table. Not very easy to eat at. (I think the table she was suppose to bring us now only has one chair  so she was improvising possibly).  Anyway brings us to another table and we wait and wait for waitress to come although water is brought right away.   She finally takes our order, my husband orders a beer which he finishes and the waitress never even checks on us until we are finished with our tapas and then asks if he would like another drink. I mean the glass has been empty for the whole meal And now we are finished and you are asking?   Anyway we say no thank you to dessert and just the check which she brings and then disappears again.  The check is wrong as she has added some triple ice cream sundae which she says oh sorry.   hummmmm.",

It was so dark inside that I couldn't take a photo, but the beets were tender and delicious. I had a bite of his salad and it was great.   We ordered two flatbreads as our entree to share:  Fiery Artichoke, Pepperoncini, Olives, and Ricotta and Tomato, Micro Mozzerella, and Caper. They were a decent size, so between the salads and flatbreads, we walked out pretty stuffed.   I'd love to go back here and eat on the patio and try out more of the menu. The service was excellent and we didn't wait too long for service or food.",

Brunch is 48.00 for adults and 28.00 for children 3 years and older.  Bottomless drinks are 28.00 per adult with a variety of great drinks to choose from.  Loved the margaritas the most.

The waiters walk around with what ever they create fresh in the kitchen and offer you small plates.  You can decline or take what ever you like as it comes.  Everything we had was perfection.  From the crepes to the sausage, it was pure perfection.    Although more people were seating outside, we wanted to be inside (cooler, darker and more quiet).  As with any Wynn Resort Restaurant, La Cave doesn't skimp on quality.   The food and drinks were delicious!  The staff were pleasant and very helpful.  All I can say is, I can't wait to be back!  Yes, it's that GOOD!",

The seasoning is incredible, everything about this dish was fantastic!  -S'mores Flatbread: last but not least the dessert! Very yummy and not to sweet!

Thanks to a friend who was related to one of the owners, we gave it a try.  And so glad we did.  And looking forward to going back.  Great ambiance-- romantic yet fun, and good for moderate groups too.  We were a group of 8 and sat in the middle of the room next to the patio with the huge windows. Beautiful.    We tried what seemed like almost *everything*.  What others rave about is pretty good (although, bacon wrapped dates just about anywhere will be good); however, some standouts were:  the beef filet flatbread, the gouda foam pasta (I normally don't care for pasta, but OMG), the ceviche (a super well balanced burst of summertime in your mouth), beef carpaccio w/ truffle aioli (WOW, just wish there was more), mushroom grits (melt in your mouth delicioso), wagyu skirt steak, and beef filet crostini.  Oh and the Smores flatbread was heavenly.  Our friend's cousin knew the executive chef, so he came out and prepared this ahi tartare that was incredible-- hope they incorporate it into the menu in the future!    Also have a great selection of specialty cocktails that are...well, what cocktails should be.  Refreshing, balanced, not too alcohol-y, and just super delicious.",

In fact, the whole place was dimly lit. Our waiter took forever to serve our table (15-20 minutes after being seated). I was rather disappointed with this. He apologized for this, but this is not the way to make a good initial impression. We started out with wine flights. I had the French wine flight and one of my other friends had the Italian wine flight.  The Italian wine flight was clean and crisp, typical of what you would find in an Italian villa. The French wine flight was full of flavor with a kick after each sip. I believe that both of those wine flights were great. I think that the Italian wine flight was $25 and the French wine flight was $30 for 4 tastings each. The wine flights had half reds and half white wines. You drink incrementally from light to dark so you drink the whites first before you drink the reds.  Make sure you bring lots of money because for the three of us, it was almost 100 bucks per each person. I have to say that the dishes we had were so good. I think the combination of all the flavors as you take a bite of each Tapas item was orgasmic. We had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, the Diver Sea Scallops with Polenta Cake, the Gorgonzola Salad, Sliced Sirloin Steak with Mushroom Fondue, Mushroom Grits, Beef Filet with Crostini, etc. Do not order everything at the same time. Order in batches so your food is warm when it comes out of the kitchen. Some dishes are quick but some take a while so you should consult your waiter about the lead times. I would love to come back here again for a special occasion as it is very expensive to dine here, but it is worth it.",

    "text": "Through weeks of prior planning, I was able to booked a surprise birthday brunch for my dear friend and 8 other people while visiting Vegas for a wedding.  The venues and space was perfect!  I made reservations via OpenTable through yelp which was very quick and efficient.    The hostess and staff at La Cave were awesome.  Upon arrive with the birthday girl, the hostess led our \"table of 2\" to the back patio where all our friends were waiting for the big surprise.  The patio area was beautiful and I adored the two hanging chairs next to our table.  The relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff made our experience quite enjoyable.    For the food we decided to all order tapas style and share amongst each other.  We considered partaking in the chef's tasting, but one person in the group was not that hungry.    We ordered: - bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese fondue - salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios - beef carpaccio with truffle aioli - beef filet, caramelized onion, mushroom, and blue cheese flatbread.    - angus mini burgers with a side of beer battered fries - diver sea scallops on top of polenta  My favorite dishes would have to be the beef carpaccio and beef filet flatbread.  I loved the texture of the flatbread...slightly chewy on the inside, crisp on the edges.  My biggest disappointment was the bacon wrapped dates.  I raved to my friends about how good they are, but the fondue sauce was a big letdown for me.  I prefer to have my dates stuffed so the cheese oozes out, perfectly mixing the sweet and savory flavors.    Overall, great place and will definitely have to come back in the evening for a romantic dinner with the bf.",

One third of the restaurant has patio seating. Reserve in advance if you want those particular tables. Inside and close to patio tables are amazing too. Prices are fare. Usually one needs two things. Example:.salad $10 and flat bread (pizza) $15. Or just get one if not hungry and you just want something to compliment the drinks. Plenty of bottled and draft beer selection. $8 to $12.  They also have good espresso, cappuccino, etc. Great to recharge before continuing the night at top night club/lounge as XS, located at the same resort property Wynn/encore.  In short place appears to be very romantic and I am sure ladies will like it. Mature, yet trendy crowd. No running around kids and strollers. Service was attentive and perfect. La cave is easy to be overlooked, but it is definitely worth it and one of the best restaurants at Wynn property that does not brake the bank.",

Worth the prices if you're the type to be more interested in satisfying your taste buds. AMBIANCE: Tasteful modern interior, dimly lit and a bit sultry - provides a great intimate atmosphere. There's an indoor and outdoor patio area where you might be able to enjoy the view of the waterfall or garden. The further away you are from the main entrance, the more cozy you'll be.  SERVICE: Attentive, friendly, beautiful servers with plenty of great suggestions. CHANCE OF RETURNING: 85%  ___________________________________  Great tapas-style dining experience, allowing you to sample a wider array of dishes in smaller quantities. Everything was consistently well prepared and delicious. The five of us quite literally wiped the plates clean.  It's also one of the few late-night places that maintain the quality of its food and service even past your typical dining hours. La Cave is a good pick whether you're just looking to pop in for drinks and a snack or an actual meal.  Will definitely be back the next time I stay at the Wynn/Encore.",

It's just outside the casino floor so it's a little more on the quiet side and offers a cozy atmosphere with great seating options in the bar area or out on the patio.   Although they are known for their wine and beer selection, the Perfect G & T on the cocktail list was damn good.   As for the food, all small plates makes it easy to share and sample a few different options. Our definite favorite was the Short Rib Tacos. I'd go back just for them.   This is a great spot for quality drinks, delicious food and a cool intimate setting. Highly recommend.",

I highly recommend make dinner reservations if you would like to eat at the patio which I highly recommend.   Came here on Saturday evening  for Cinco De Mayo Weekend on May 4th. Reservations for 6:30 pm which also recommend to have a early dinner so you are able to get easy access to the patio area and beat the crowd. First moments of seeing the front of restaurant we were greeted by hostess. The revolving door immediately catch my eye as we followed the hostess to our table the first part of the restaurant you see a long thanksgiving table, and when you look up there is a motto in red light  \" In Vino Veritas.\" Very catchy!   Second part of the restaurant is my favorite, (hence La cave and Hideaway) it's like you are going through a tunnel and you see a light and once you find this sacred hidden gem you found an oasis of nature. The atmosphere was a Spring, Blooming Breezy weather while you hear the birds chirping. The outdoor/ indoor patio dining is the highlight of this place. Open layout.  A wall of Green foliage on side of the wall.   Our waiter was very informative and attentive as well as the whole entire staff. The menu was described to us as tapas style ( small portions) and great for sharing. ( Please note this is not a Spanish tapas restaurant) just to clarify that if its not stated on the other reviews) On the menu section of From the sea:  we ordered the Chilled Ahi Tuna, Lemon Risotto cake with Basil Aioli. From the Grill: we ordered the Moroccan Chicken Skewers with pear Chutney and pita bread. Prime Flat iron steak with blueberry Glaze with truffle Mushroom Grits. Pacific Sea Bass with Broccolini and Charred Octopus with Crispy Fingerling potatoes. Everything that we ordered was delicious with its own flavor profile. If you have a high flavor palette come to this hidden gem.  Their dessert menu was very limited so I took the chance of ordering Smore's Flatbread which I felt that I could make at home. I recommend to work on the dessert menu which did not align with the food menu. Please elevate your dessert menu.   Dress code for this place is resort casual. For the ladies: Bring a light sweater with you because it can really be cool at night this time of Spring season but  perfect weather to dine at the patio will be spring. Not too hot and not too cold. Just a perfect Spring oasis. Great for groups to socialize and have wine.",

    "text": "We came here because we saw good ratings over all. All we knew was this is a tapas and wine bar. As we walked into the restaurant, it was very dark like a celler and the music was loud. For our relaxing dining, i thought we picked a wrong restaurant but passing through the dark bar, there came a large open air, sun room like dining area. We instantly fell in love with this restaurant. The window is wide open but the temperature is controlled perfectly for the comfortable dining. We had glasses of wine, flight of wine and several dishes. My favorite dish was bacon wrapped dates. The server was very polite and helpful. Even though the restaurant was filled with guests, it was still quiet, breezy and relaxing. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

You could not even look out at the windows as they were blocked out. We ended up hanging in the bar area all night. The food and  drinks were good. Service excellent. Like I said this is one of my favorite places to check out. Not much else to say I can only hope the next time I'm in town the reason to be here, \"The View\" will be back.",

    "text": "Temporarily shuttered for renovation, but now open once again across from The Buffet at Wynn, it is at La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway that diners can find a different sort of \"all you can eat\" experience from 10:30am until 2:00pm on weekends.  Opened in late 2010 by Michael Morton, at that time the only Wynn Restaurant operated by an outside source but now joined by both Urth Cafe as well as Cipriani, it is at a hostess podium outside that guests are first met, staff then escorting them past a neon fixture reading \"In vino veritas\" en route to a dining room decorated in dark wood and foliage.  Built to resemble the tasting rooms of Northern California, a pair of Bars including one with seating flanked by temperature-controlled vaults, it is seated on leather chairs as light enters from opaque glass that menus are offered, the first a lengthy list of Wines by the bottle or glass and the other a collection of small plates served \"butler style.\"  Intimate in terms of atmosphere, a light soundtrack and hushed conversations complimented by staff who bring around a list of twenty items at varying intervals, it was with one diner adding-on bottomless Bloody Marys and Mimosas that the other opted for Coffee and a Cocktail, the Tuscan Pear offering a syrupy mouthfeel but plenty of booze reined in by bright Citrus.  Offering American small-plates by Chef Billy DeMarco, several years with the Morton Group including the opening of CRUSH at MGM following years in New York, it is not long after arrival that Food begins to circulate, an opening Gazpacho 'Shooter' refreshing by way of Basil Oil while sliced Tomatoes around fresh Mozzarella and a Basil Leaf were brightened by a drizzle of Balsamic Vinegar.  Moving next to Yogurt, Granola and Fresh Fruit, each item presented from a tray for the guest's acceptance or denial, it was from a cone lined with paper that snappy Sausage and Bacon were plucked before transitioning to \"Chicken and Waffles,\" or in the case the choice of Wing or Drumstick tossed with Mexican Hot Sauce atop a quarter circle that remains crisp around the edges and fluffy on the inside.   Quiet around 11:30 but filling to perhaps quarter capacity by noon, those dissuaded by 45-minute lines at The Buffet all but guaranteed a better experience for approximately the same price at La Cave, it was atop Filet grilled medium that a poached Egg and Paprika was served, the English Muffin readily soaking up Yolk and Hollandaise Sauce just as a skillet of Polenta offered in follow-up had become thick by way of saturation with Cream, Pecorino Cheese and Truffle Oil.  Delighting with toasted Bagels and Lox, the house-smoked Fish served in a good ratio to classic condiments, fans of Hash will also appreciate DeMarco's shredded Veal served with Peppers and Potatoes while Angus \"Mini Burgers\" are also nicely presented and far from the typical Slider thanks to Mushrooms served like a Spread along with smoky Mayonnaise.  Underwhelmed by both Flatbreads, a staple of the lunch and dinner menu unfortunately undercooked and presented luke-warm, it was with good fortune that these were quickly followed by all-new Snickers Pancakes topped in Bananas Foster, the melted Chocolate and Caramel adding unexpected texture to fluffy Buttermilk and the overall sweetness assuring no additional Syrup was necessary.  Swapping out share plates on request, a necessity for those not wanting to mix sweet with savory, it was after another round of Grits that La Cave's Egg \"Sandwich\" arrived, the flavor highlighted by Tomato plus a touch of heat while \"Loaded\" Tots were heavy but delicious thanks to Bacon, Cheddar and Brown Gravy.  Finishing up sweet, a male server who scampered off after presenting one tiny piece of tepid French Toast doing a disservice to what might have otherwise been a decent dish, it was after another skillet of Chicken and Waffles that another type of Waffle was offered, this one riddled with Cinnamon and topped with Apples plus mixed Berries that led nicely into Pastries and Cookies highlighted by a soft and chewy Oatmeal Raisin round plus an incredibly light Raspberry Muffin that turned out to be Gluten-free.   ****Smartly designed for the sort of guests typically visiting Wynn, La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway's Butler-style Brunch offers good value for just $42 per person thanks to well-designed plates, professional service and the sort of room conducive to quiet conversation and relaxation.",

Another plus was that the courses were timed really well- you'd finish a dish, very short wait and then the next thing would come out. Also a nice non-pretentious/casual vibe for this caliber of food. One of my top restaurants in Vegas. Can't wait to go back. Oh, and prices are reasonable too, which is a nice change in this town.",

My fiance and I shared the seared tuna, which was good but we could have done without, the scallops, which were amazing, the asparagus and egg salad, also amazing, the prosciutto flat bread, and the filet mignon.  The plates are small, but that was the perfect amount of food.  Others in the group loved the flatbreads too, and the beat salad, bacon wrapped dates, sliders, and hamachi.

It wasn't possible to determine if the ham was Jamon or procutto (big difference) because the egg dominated the flavor. Not well balanced.   Bacon wrapped dates: I try these at every Tapas joint. These don't disappoint and made a perfect desert to our meal.   Salt roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachios: nicely presented, with a balanced pallets of flavors. A nice rendition of a common tapas dish.   Sliced sirloin steak with a mushroom fondue and cippolini onions: easily the best dish we tried. The steak was cooked to perfection and the mushroom fondue had a rich smokey flavor.",

    "text": "Yummy food!  Good/strange service...  Odd music selections. We sat on the patio, which was soooo nice.  We hit it on an overcast day and really enjoyed some rare summer cool weather - lucky us!    I made reservations for the patio and they asked if we had dietary restrictions.  When we arrived, they tried to seat us inside!  They didn't have record of the patio request even though the lady confirmed it on the phone.  But, they did have our dietary needs noted.  The view was awesome and the surroundings are so nice.  The food we ordered was great, but my friend ordered a salmon dish and I ordered a side of fingerling potatoes.  They brought out my potatoes with a hunk of salmon resting on top!  So weird!!!  They apologized and took it back, presenting them both the way they should be.  Well, I'm allergic to fish and I asked if they just brought back the potatoes that had the fish resting on them (they took it away instead of leaving it, so I assumed they just separated the two and re-presented them).  They came back and said that they couldn't verify if that had been done (to me that means yes it had and that was embarrassing to admit).  So, they re-did the potatoes.  There was a woman in a suit helping us fix problems and seemed more of the upper level management sort. This whole ordeal didn't sit well with our waitress who was not happy that we \"tattled\" on her about her messing up the order somehow, her taking the food away and having it re-prepared, etc.  But what choice did we have?  Two dishes were combined into one and I'm allergic to fish, so we needed to say something!  So, when it came time to order desserts, I asked the waitress if we could see a dessert menu.  She goes, \"All of the desserts were listed on the original menus I brought out to you!\"  As if we were supposed to have them memorized and pre-know if we wanted dessert or not!  Really strange.  I told her that I did not have her menu items memorized and if she could please bring out the menus again that would be most appreciated.  Unreal to have to ask twice for a dessert menu, which she didn't even offer up.  Even lower-end restaurants ask if you want dessert. We ended up getting port instead of dessert and it was really good.   All of the food was AMAZING!!!  Everyone was happy with their plates and everything I tasted was 100% delicious.   The only other caveat was the music selection on the patio.  It went from classical to dance club to david bowie and back again to other types of music all over the place.  All music I love, but somehow this randome mix on the patio with palm trees nearby just doesn't go.  I think a little upbeat mediterranean mix would be perfect for that patio or even just the more ambient dance club stuff turned down low...  Bad music choices can make or break the full dining experience. Overall, four stars with a few little glitches!  We had a great time and the service was outstanding mixed with not-so-great.  We decided that they need to train their waitstaff across the board so there aren't problems like this for future patrons.   I will be returning though, and crossing my fingers that these minor details are fixed!  :)",

I could not have enjoyed our evening more.. it was the perfect ending to a great trip to Vegas. Congratulation La Cave.. you have a winner of a restaurant!!!

We had the ahi tuna with pomegranate (light and so flavorful), dates wrapped in bacon with blue cheese fondue (heaven on earth), angus mini burgers (delish), beets with goat cheese and pistacchios (so good and great mixture of textures)' scallops with polenta (fresh and filling), filet mignon, carameluzed onion and blue cheese flatbread (perfect marriage of flavors). We asked the server to pace out the dishes so we can enjoy each one. Everything was so fntastic and just a nice break from all the heavy Vegas fare. Will definitely go back!",

    "text": "I was fortunate to have business meetings at the Wynn this past week and made it a point to have lunch at La Cave as I had heard great things. And I was definitely impressed. La Cave, known for their small plates, flatbreads and extensive wine list, was simply amazing! I dined with 2 colleagues and ordered 5 plates, which was more than enough to share. I will review in the order we received our food, starting with the mushroom grits which were to die for! I don't believe I had ever had grits before and my first experience eating them was amazing. The grits are served with the mushrooms, pecorino cheese and butter on top and after mixing everything in, each bite I took was absolutely delicious. Next up was the salt-roasted beets, topped with goat cheese and pistachios. Every beet salad I've had in the past is usually served cold, whereas the beets I enjoyed at La Cave were warm and fresh. Shortly thereafter came the bacon-wrapped dates which were also out of this world. Our chorizo & sausage flatbread came next which was a very generous serving. The flatbread was unlike any other with the unique toppings served here. Finally, we had ordered the stuffed chicken and that is the only dish I wouldn't highly recommend. While not bad, it was just chicken with no unique touches. All in all, I am so glad I was able to dine at La Cave and will definitely return upon my next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "La Cave at the Wynn is by far the best Tapas restaurant if not one of the best overall places to dine in Vegas, I wish they had one in LA. It was just three of us who went last Friday night, sitting in the back room past the bar gave us a great view of the wine bar and beautiful arches. We are huge foodies and were starving so we thought we would just order a bunch of items thinking they would be tiny...We were pleasantly surprised to find that they were huge and no skimping on portions like most tapa digs. While waiting for our order the sommelier was more than attentive and patient offering up tastes for us to find the perfect glass of wine for the evening. We appreciated the patience and the good listening, if they were only all like that then the even the most inexperienced wine lovers would be taken on a journey. After finding our perfect pairings we served with the chorizo andouille sausage flatbread, the pomegranate sashimi that has this incredible taste and hint of cinnamon, hamachi, some truffle cheese grits-OMG-they got it right! Growing up in the south and a avid grit cook not many restaurants can get grits right but they do, served in a tiny cute cast iron pot keeps them hot for hours making each bite perfect! we then continued our tapas excursion with beets and goat cheese, bacon wrapped dates, grilled asparagus with fried egg(a little difficult to cut into but well worth the bite), beef filet with crostini served with these two sauces, one truffle and one like a red wine glaze, rack of lamb which was again to die for, some green salad and by this time we wanted to keep ordering and eating but were stuffed. We would have ordered the entire menu if we could have, everything is just that good. We ended it with a mixed dessert plate and a huge smile. Michael Morton and Executive Chef Billy really know what they are doing. This is a hidden gem in not only Vegas but everywhere. The service and ambiance were up to par.  We even returned the next night for a late night bite after we were sorely disappointed and left starved from our stint at blue ribbon at the Cosmo.  I'd fly to Vegas just to eat here.  It's a breath of fresh air to someone who got it right.",

We ordered the onion soup which was excellently prepared, along with the salmon sashimi crackers, gorgonzola salad and grilled salmon. Salmon sashimi was the only one that was not outstanding; it was fun but not amazing and a bit pricey for what you got. I ordered the La Cave pale ale which did not disappoint. I also find that the price-value is good here in comparison to all the other overpriced restaurants on the strip. For three drinks and four dishes, we got out for under $100. Service is a little uneven but they are very nice and that makes up for a slightly awkward server set up. Would highly recommend this to anyone staying near the Wynn.",

We had the bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with blue cheese - the bacon was very, very well done.  Our favorite flatbread with filet and caramelized onions had way more mushrooms than filet, way more cheese than in the past and was underseasoned.  Remembering how this dish was always such a flavor explosion, I felt weird shaking salt and pepper on it.  The caesar salad with the lemon anchovy dressing, all tied up with a proscuitto ribbon, was outstanding.  I could've eaten 4 of those.  We've enjoyed La Cave so much in the past, the other dishes overshadowed the salad, making this visit disappointing.  La Cave's not at the top of our list anymore.",

Without exception, every dish we tried was fantastic, from the crab lettuce cups, scallops on polenta cakes, beets, charcuterie, ceviche etc.  Between four of us we knocked out about 8 different plates.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful day.  The Wynn does a great job of creating a very relaxing setting at its restaurants.  The only ding was the wait.  It took a really, really long time just to get the order in, and then the plates almost all came out at once, so there was a lot of juggling of dishes on the table.  Either way, La Cave is a place that I recommend and look forward to coming to again.",

The beets were tasteless, even with pistachio crusting, it really didn't stand out. The sirloin with mushroom fondue was  a filler, not as savory as I expected. The flat bread was good, but not what I come to vegas for (I got mozz and capers, thought simple would be the way to go, but it wasn't great).

They charged $48/person for brunch but serving mediocre food like tater tots, scrambled eggs (I can get these for much cheaper at a fast food place), chicken wings, pancakes (which, btw, tastes much worse than my homemade ones), mixed fruit salad, bacons.... I mean, we paid over $100 for two for this kind of food was such a joke!!! To top it off, the server also dropped the food on me! That brunch totally ruined our entire day which btw not only Father's Day, but also our Anniversary! Never again we will waste our money like this at a place like that. Should have gone to the buffet instead! Don't go there, save your money for the slot machine!",

    "text": "I was surprised that for under $110 (including tax and tip) that 2 people were able to have drinks, be well fed, and have it all within the pricey Wynn hotel.  Great by the glass wine selection due to the ever gaining popularity enomatic system.  Quite pricey though, but what isn't in these upper class casinos?  I love the coziness of the restaurant, and the service was impeccable.  The food was fantastic, and surprisingly filling despite it's small plate size.  I really enjoyed my dinner here before going to see Le Reve, and would probably come back next time I'm in Vegas.  The only thing that I felt could have been better: they turned on the big screen TV on the wall and put it on football during my dinner.  When I go for an intimate dinner in a nice low lit fancy restaurant, I don't really want the blaring lights and distraction of sports taking away from the experience.  It's not a sports bar, and that kind of surprised me that they had that.",

The menu is small, but packed with lots of interesting stuff.   Be aware that everything is basically tapas. Small plates, but really good for sharing. We ended up with 5 items for two people. Roasted beets (excellent), bacon wrapped dates (divine),  grilled hanger steak with mashed potatoes (fantastic), flatbread (tasty) and some kind of chocolate mousse dessert (very tasty and rich).   All around good experience. Can be sneaky expensive if you are not paying attention to what you are ordering.   I would easily good back. Especially for late night dining.",

The food was absolutely amazing (favorite was the Mushroom Grits, hands down)  the ambiance very trendy and hip.  And the staff was very kind, nothing snotty in the tone at all!

    "text": "We were staying at the Wynn and looking for a place to eat before our show--not too fancy, not too expensive, but also not a burger and fries.   This place got good reviews and looked nice, so we thought it would be a winner. Honestly the food wasn't bad--but for the price, it just wasn't all that. The only dish that was really pretty awesome was the snapper ceviche--flavor and texture were both good, and we liked the little fried lotus chips that came with it. The flatbread with steak and mushrooms wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing, and again, for the $16 or so it cost, I would have wanted to be wowed a little more. My husband had asparagus with jamon serrano and a poached egg; he was underwhelmed. The ham was so crispy it was more like bacon than prosciutto...again, edible, but way overpriced. The waitress forgot to put in our order for chocolate risotto, then did; the taste wasn't bad but the texture was a little mushy and the portion was tiny. I had a glass of wine, which was a little too warm and the bottle had obviously been opened at least a day or two before. Not so bad I couldn't drink it--I did--but at $15/glass, I think they could have tried a little harder. I know $15/glass is standard in Vegas, but that bottle wasn't worth more than $15; the least they could have done was serve it at the correct temperature.  For 3 tapas dishes, 1 dessert, 1 beer and 1 glass of wine (low-end wine, mind you) the check was $84 plus tip. OK, not the most expensive place in the resort or on the Strip, but it was pricey, underwhelming and my husband left hungry. They should either lower the prices, beef up the portions, make more amazing food or all of the above.",

They probably had 4-5 people on the line and they didn't communicate with each other- at all.  Every.  Complete and utter silence, which I thought was so strange.  They were not a-lovin-their job.  They were just robots going through the motion.   Maybe the kitchen is set up that way on purpose, but I have never seen a kitchen not communicate- at all.  I think it came across in the food too.  No love in the food.  I had a flatbread that was really, fell flat.  Nothing to it.  I did have a braised veal pasta dish that was good.  The service was okay.  I had a decent wine flight.

Offered in two, four, and six ounce pours, the drink was a Shafer syrah which is a unique wine to pour by the glass. The snack was cheese with grilled toast points. The truffle tremor goat and buttermilk blue cheeses were both nice selections. The toast points were burnt. I really have to question a kitchen that doesn't know how to make toast. The snack could have included charcuterie if something other than Creminelli cured meats from Utah (I'm not a fan) was offered.",

The brunch is all you can eat, but it's served tapas style with butler service (basically a waiter bringing you out the food as soon as it ready from the kitchen). Highlights of our meal were the sliders,the corn flake crusted French toast and the mushroom grits. The portions were a good size and the atmosphere is beautiful. This more upscale than your typical Vegas buffet and as such more expensive, but the quality of the food is much better and it's still all you can eat. The service was very attentive and anything you want to go back to they will go back to the kitchen and get bring you back something freshly prepared. We loved this experience and will definitely be back.",

Our group decided to not do the traditional sharing- and each ordered 2 or 3.  I got the charcuterie board- selecting 2 meats and 2 cheeses; and the beef carpaccio. Wow on both. The carpaccio was probably one of the best things ever.  The charcuterie - get the Truffle tremor. It's amazing. And I received a huge portion of prosciutto, along with the other salumi.

I forget just how amazing this property is until I see the landscaping that was designed for this property.     The dishes here are served tapas style with bit-sized portion.  Our servers were amazing; we had one in training and she was a delight and very tentative.  We ordered the following:  *Fiery Artichoke, Roasted Pepper, Olives Flatbread- This was delightful, tasty with a kick in flavor that lingers nicely after the first bite.  *Salt-roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese, Pistachio- This was the delight of the entire meal for me; for someone who doesn't like beets, they season the beets just perfect with a nice salty and sweetness to it.  First bite you get the sweetness but it finishes off with a nice saltiness.  *Roasted Salmon, Vegetable Pasta, Yellow Tomato Broth- The salmon had a touch of roast flavor but not to overpowering flavor of seasoning.    And for washing down all the yummy food, I had the Fruli Strawberry beer, unlike Lindemans Framboise, Fruli Strawberry beer has just the right amount of fruitiness and perfect amount of malted beer flavor!  It goes down smoothly, flavorful and tasty!  The menu definitely looks like it will please the masses and has a bit of everything for everyone!

    "text": "The Wynn and Encore are some of my favorite properties in Las Vegas. Their elegant styling with classic and luxurious design cues all make for a perfect resort. Walking into SW Steakhouse with no reservation, I realized I was being too optimistic. Reservations is a must at SW -- lesson learned. Scratching that idea, our dinner plans turned into something more casual but elegant at the same time. La Cave at the Wynn is a wine bar, tapas bar, and hideaway all in one. I don't know what a food hideaway is exactly, but that's what it is. Their classic tapas items paired with some interesting wine tastings made for an incredible dinner service. SW steakhouse surely wasn't on the back of our minds.  We started thngs off with the La Cave Caesar salad. With the Romaine lettuce left whole, we cut into it like a steak. Wrapped in the most delectable, yet really salty prosciutto, I was all smiles. Mixed all together with their lemon anchovy dressing, the salad was a great ice breaker for our meal. The addition of fried anchovy made this Caesar salad a legit one.  Who orders soup at a restaurant, let alone, a tapas bar? This guy! Their onion soup really looked good with the puff pastry \"poofed\" up on top. With gruyere cheese mixed up all in the puff pastry, the dough had a great toasted cheese taste. The broth in it was rich and addicting. I just didn't want it to end. Mixing the broth with the cheesy puff pastry made for a perfect bite.  It was time for wine! I opted to try the Spanish wine tasting selection. With four different kinds from specific regions, I was bound to find at least one that I like.  I find myself ordering bacon wrapped dates at every tapas joint I go to. The salty and sweet combo is done all the time and I like to try them all and compare. Most of the restaurants prepare them similarly, but they are never the same. At La Cave, the dates were huge. This meant really big sweet flavors. The bacon's saltiness wasn't enough to counter balance the sweet dates, so the help of blue cheese fondue did the trick. . Just as the bacon wrapped dates, every tapas needs to have good flatbread options. Their chicken flatbread was a good option. With Thai basil, chili sauce, and garlic aioli, the flatbread had lots of flavor. For what it was, the dough and crust was decent as well. Possibly, any of the classic flat breads on the menu would have been good as well.  I love a perfectly cooked shrimp, and theirs was just that. Mixed in with chopped piquillo peppers, fingerling potatoes, and roasted garlic, the flavors popped in your mouth. The piquillo peppers made this dish as it was all I could really taste. I think a better crust on the shrimp with the addition of extra salt would have perfected this dish nicely.  Not eating at SW Steakhouse meant we had to find our beef elsewhere. We found it in their beef filet. Siting on top of crostini with some blue cheese melted on top, this was a perfect filet. I felt the beef could have been cooked a little more on the rare. The slightly over cooked meat was forgiven with the 2 sauces that came with it. One was a thickened onion based sauce, and the other was a mushroom/truffle reduced cream sauce. Both were exceptional with this beef, but the white mushroom/truffle cream reduction was just heavenly. I shamelessly just lathered this stuff on each bite.  After seeing the bill, I realized I probably would have spent this much at SW. The only difference is, and it's a big difference, I would have only eaten beef and some side item of starch. Granted, that beef would have been quite nice, and the bread and butter would have perfect, I had diversity. That is the beauty of tapas. Where other restaurants are all about doing one thing and doing it right, tapas is all about trying new things and repeating that over and over. La Cave was an awesome detour for dinner. The place was busy and the crowd was young and hip. It was dark in there though, hence the crappy pictures. I mean, it is a \"hideaway\" afterall.",

Reasons why I love this place... 1) love the fact is a tapas place, they offer a good selection of delicious small plates.  2) beautiful decor, very relaxing, patio has a stunning view and some super cool seating. 3) the price is perfect, for the quality you get I think this place is hidden gem, think maybe that's why they named it La Cave   Anyways, you really should try it if you haven't you are missing out. Best dishes, crab lettuce cup, diver sea scallops, and the beef Carpaccio.....",

They give you a few different selections of drinks included in the bottomless which I thought was awesome. Service was a little slow to start as we didn't get our drinks until after the first few food items came which also didn't come by until about 20 minutes after we sat. We watched a food runner completely skip our table and go back to the kitchen with a full tray of food that we could've had. It was very offputting. Afterwards, when the food started slowly rolling in, we were able to try most of what was on the menu. There are a few items that don't come out that you can ask for, which they quickly bring out. The short rib hash was phenomenal as was the corn flake crusted French toast. All of the other food was decent, but nothing spectacular. I also appreciated that they recognized our friends birthday and made her feel special. Their dinner is 10x better as far as food and service so I'll stick with that if I come back.",

    "text": "Finally made it out to La Cave for a full dinner and I hate to say it, but I wasn't as wowed as I thought I would be. We came in and took a seat at the food bar, where we watched the guys cook awesome looking flatbreads all night long. The first task was inspecting the wine list. I must say, even for Vegas the prices on the list were high. Saw a pinot grigio that I can get for $12 in Utah on there for $55. But we're celebrating, right? But there were many unique varieties of wine on there, which is much better than we can do back home. After asking the sommellier a few question, we decided on an ansonica, which we'd never tried (or heard of) before. We were very happy with the selection, which had a very unique slightly sweet flavor.   First, we had a couple of meats and cheeses: one blue cheese, one soft and creamy cheese, and a bit of salami, all very tasty and complimentary. The first (and biggest) miss of the night was with the beef carpaccio dish that came next. I'm sure the beef was of very high quality, but all I could smell when it arrived was truffle oil. The smell was a huge turn off and negatively impacted the taste of the dish as well. I definitely wouldn't recommend that dish.  After that, we had a shrimp dish with piquillo peppers. The dish had a lot of nice, big, fresh shrimp that we loved. However, we'd primarily ordered this dish due to our love of piquillo peppers, and this just had a few chopped bits that were overpowered by the accompanying sauce. I really would have liked to see them do something with this that accented the peppers more.  Our final two dishes were veal short ribs and a flatbread with olives and artichokes. The veal was probably the best dish of the night. The tender veal had a wonderful flavor. Still, I felt that the accompanying sauce was a bit too strong for meat of this quality. I really wanted the natural flavor of the veal to stand out more. The flatbread was a nice way to end the meal. It was perfectly cooked, with tasty fresh vegetables. The goat cheese really accented the flavors.   I feel as if this review might be overly picky, as we definitely did enjoy the wine and the food (except for the beef). But simply put: while this was a very good meal, there are many better places to go for small plates in Vegas. And given the choice between those places and this one, they're going to revamp the menu a bit to get me to come back.",

    "text": "One of Wynn's newer places, sometimes called a tapas restaurant; but let's get serious.  That has lost all meaning.  It is small plates, in no way Spanish.  Come on, people! It seems like it was just a few years ago that if I said I went to a \"tapas\" place, that was misconsTrued as women with no clothes.  Now every spot that wants to overcharge for a flatbread is throwing that moniker around.  (End rant.)  The Vegan Menu, which is all I care about, was small, but everything on it looked great.  There are about 6 items, ranging in price from ~$10-14.  I went with Amanda, and we shared four dishes: roasted beets w/ cashew cheez and pistachios, roasted pepper, kalamata, and artichoke flatbread, quinoa with caponata, and gardein \"chicken breast\" with sauteed greens and celery root puree.  I thoroughly enjoyed everything, but the gardein and beets were my favorites! The bread of the flatbread was pretty amazing too.  That would make a fabulous pizza.  No real vegan desserts (they offered fruit).  I had a flight of Spanish wines (4 2oz pours, $20) that were all good.  They have flights for every budget, which is AWESOME.  Great way to expand your wine palate.   My only real complaint is the ridiculously small tables, especially for a place where you will be eating multiple dishes at once.  Also, they do not make any effort to time the dishes, they just come out willy nilly, so ours were all there at once.    The service and ambiance were fine, nothing to write home about but no complaints.  I would definitely go back and try the remaining two dishes (and get the gardein again!).",

La Cave falls under the \"me too\" category.   For me, price should be an indicator of quality, and while La Cave excels in providing amazing service and creating  a wonderful dining atmosphere they fall short in their menu offerings, the most important element of dining out.   We ordered the fixed menu where they bring out their best dishes for us to sample. Overall the dishes were good but overall nothing to make you say WOW. That doesn't mean there weren't 'wow' elements to the dinner. My favorite dish was the Mushroom Grits with Pecorino Cheese. Hands down the best dish they offer and definitely a dish I would go back for. The mixed green salad was also out of this world.   Bacon wrapped dates were ok. The seafood dishes were also okay, the salmon was overcooked and fishy. For dessert we were brought the s'mores flatbread. My thought of those, why reinvent our beloved wheel? Graham crackers, Hershey's and Marshmallows... a sacred match made in heaven never to be broken up.   Will I be back? Probably not until they revamp their menu, but if you've never been might be worth a check out.",

    "text": "La Cave services small bites and has food I would consider as California Cuisine.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, flatbread, and grits.  The food was good, but nothing out of the world.  What really stuck to us though would be the horrible service we encountered while at this restaurant.  After ordering our food, we were pretty much ignored by our waiter even though there were other customers in the room with us.  The wait staff helped our the other tables but never really came back to us to see if we needed more water.  In the end, we ended having to wave our arms like mad in order to catch the attention of anyone in the room to hand us our bill.  We never received a refill of water that we wanted.  After getting our bill, it took a lot of flailing around trying to get the attention of our waiter to finally get him to take our bill.  What was frustrating about the entire situation was that he walked by us a few times, saw that we were trying to get his attention and continued to ignore us.  I was able to see him look over at us, ignore us, and then continue on.  After doing that twice, he finally came by to pick up our bill once he saw how frustrated we were becoming and asked \"oh, are you ready now?\".  He didn't bother to hand us our credit card back himself, sending someone else to do it.  We wrote our unhappiness on the receipt.  I don't feel as though it was so busy to the point that this type of service is okay.  Actually, given the fact that La Cave is at the Wynn, I had expected so much more from them.  I was very disappointed and upset.",

Unfortunately, they may bring a cup with sausage and bacon that serves 1 when you very obviously have 5 or 6 at your table. So you end up having to ask for more a lot. Great for the restaurant, but not so much for diners. The NY Egg Breakfast Sandwich was very good; the bread was soft. The Veal Hash was excellent, as was the Gazpacho.",

We have walked this place many times at the Wynn, and finally stopped. Cozy and nice. It was very quiet and easy to talk while waiting.  Service : Excellent. We were seated quickly, with a good view of the pool area. It was comfortably cool inside. Our waitperson was friendly and helpful and made sure we were well taken care of.  Food : Lots of choices. Servings are small, but easy for two to share. I started with the scallops and mushroom grits. The grits may have been my favorite item, with great flavor, best while hot. Scallops were also great, served with a tasty polenta cake. My wife ordered the bacon and egg pasta and the Wagyu flat iron steak. She enjoyed both, the steak was rare and very tasty. The pasta was surprisingly good as well. All choices were flavorful but not overly seasoned. Smaller portions equalled more chances to try things, a plus for me. They served when things were ready, so everything was hot.....  Dessert : a special note. Save room for the s'mores flatbread dessert.  We will be back, sooner than later I hope.",

Vegas has too many restaurants with great quality ingredients and flavors at this price point. We had such a mixed experience. The service: Eddie, our waiter, although green (just turned 21), gave spot on recommendations and exceptional service. Our sommelier on the other hand was an incredible snob. My husband and I are experienced in wine selection and this is not our first rodeo. We clearly stated we wanted to start with a white and move to a Pinot Noir for the main course. First, he was clearly annoyed that we were not buying a bottle for each course and then continued to recommend the most expensive Cab on the menu. Poor form. Food: The scallops,  wagu skirt steak, & mushrooms grits were out of this world!!! (All recommendations from our waiter) The ceviche was bland and clearly missing the habanero, which was high-lighted on the menu. The bacon and egg fettuccini had spot on flavor, but the pasta was severely overcooked (unforgivable in my opinion). I would pass up this mediocre choice for a more refined option.",

The dimmed lights are making the place very intimate and cozy. Make sure you sit somewhere further away from the entrance.   The portions are small. For two people you have to order 5-6 things if you don't want to be hungry.  We liked the flatbreads, those with the chorizo, the figs and the one with the poached quail eggs.",

The food was boring, very tiny, and very forgettable - and not cheap!    If I'm paying 20 for a bite of food, then each bite better be good - they were all worse than the buffet choices, and upsettingly boring. The flatbread was greasy....  It was ok-ish, but not great.  It was so dark, though, that we couldn't even read the menu...there's intimate, and then there's just plain too dark!",

    "text": "We wanted something to eat, but we were still way too full from a late lunch to handle a lot of food, so we headed for small plates. La Cave to the very delicious, very enjoyable rescue!  As many reviewers have already noted, these are \"small plates,\" not Spanish tapas. However, if you enjoy delicious food, you'll be alright.  They had an entire vegan option menu, which we ended up ordering from exclusively after some debate about whether or not to diversify. We got the three bean salad, the eggplant caponata, and the mushroom tortellini. The sommelier, a really fun and knowledgeable woman with whom it was a pleasure to speak, steered us to an unusual Trousseau Gris from the Russian River that was unique and very good. It paired very nicely with everything, but it really shined with the tortellini.  The three bean salad was AMAZING. It's green beans (haricot vert if that's your thing), white beans, and roasted chickpeas, along with roasted artichoke hearts, some seasoning, and an ice wine vinaigrette. The artichoke hearts were phenomenal. They were tender, cooked perfectly, and so flavorful. I could have eaten a plate of those and been happy.  The mushroom tortellini, in a cashew cream sauce, had amazing rich flavors and textures. The pasta was ever so slightly over-cooked, but that was easily overshadowed for me by how delicious the dish was. I think this was my favorite dish of the night.  The eggplant caponata was good, but the spices in it clashed with our other two dishes. It was also cold, but the eggplant was warm, so it was a little bit confusing in my mouth. It was, nonetheless, enjoyable--it's just that with standout dishes like the previous two, this had a lot to live up to.  The staff was universally pleasant and on top of their game. They were genuinely enjoyable to interact with and had great suggestions and thoughts for us. However, a word of warning: they recommend two small plates per person, but we were not that hungry, so we went with three for the two of us. We had PLENTY of food. Unless you have a huge stomach/appetite, I suggest sticking to 1.5 per person if you don't want to leave uncomfortably full.  Overall, I really enjoyed the experience thoroughly. I would love to come back to delve further into their impressive wine list.",

Now let's talk about the Tapas... 2 thumbs up for the Mushroom Grits and the Diver Sea Scallops... awesome.  Together we ordered 3 Tapas dishes and had a glass of wine a piece.

I shared the beet salad, green bean salad, egg over easy sandwich, and flatbread pizza (don't remember all the formal names) with a gf.

Patio: Great sitting outside on the patio overlooking the pool / grounds.  Very peaceful and relaxing.  Not a huge place, but definitely a spot I want to go to relax and have a good drink.  Food: Seriously awesome food.  We never came here for dinner, but more for lunch/place to relax for a bit, so it was never very busy.  We had the charcuterie plate multiple days, and for $36, it's an absolute steal.  You get a ton of meat/cheese, and its all very fresh and well done.  The hot coppa was my favorite by far.  Additionally, we tried the pasta with the fried egg on top which was one of our favorite pastas on the trip believe it or not, as well as their steak flatbread which was perfect.  10/10 on food - Didn't expect that, but it was awesome.  Overall, can't recommend this place enough.  It's quiet, nice, great staff, and unbelievable food and drink.",

    "text": "Great little hideout within the Wynn. We booked this place because we were watching Le Reve at 7:00pm and thought we'd grab an early dinner before then.  FOOD: Ordered their La Cave Caesar Salad ($11.00), Onion Soup ($9.00), Shrimp Ceviche ($15.00), Tomato, Micro Mozzarella, Caper Flatbread ($14.00), Black Angus Sirloin Steak ($22.00), Rack of Lamb ($23.00), Strowngbow Apple Cider ($9.00), Strawberry Cucumber Lemonade ($16.00), and a Chocolate Mousse Cake ($9.00).  The La Cave Caesar is marvelous little appetizer to start off dinner, it's Bibb lettuce wrapped in a thinly sliced Prosciutto with lightly brushed on Caesar dressing. I really enjoyed it since it wasn't so heavy with dressing and the Prosciutto was the perfect amount to give a nice savory kick to the fresh lettuce. The Shrimp Ceviche was a little sweet for me since the peach and pineapple chutney has a really sweet undertone, but shrimps were crunchy and definitely cleaned well. Their flatbread I think was highlight of the dinner in terms of portion and price, especially in Vegas upscale restaurants. It's enough to feed two people at least and visually it's not overly oily like normal pizzas are. My sister and brother seemed to really enjoy the texture and the how the flavors were light and flavorful. The Black Angus Sirloin is to die for! I definitely recommend it. It was so tender and juicy, cooked to perfection that it melted in my mouth when I ate it. Ahhh! I can still taste the delicious aroma of their Sirloin steak!  SERVICE: Our waitress was absolutely lovely, my sister has difficulty making up her mind when it comes to deciding on a dish, but she was patient with us and was just terrific. Great attitude with a charming smile and bright personality! She wasn't overly pushy in terms of over checking up on us nor did she disappear the entire time we were dining.  AMBIANCE: Just spectacular! I made a reservations note that I wanted to sit in their garden patio and that was where we were seated. Our seats were more like front porchesque couches where you get to sit back with long comfy pillows all around as you sip wine and look at the beautiful view of Vegas through their glass patio. Soft jazz music gingerly danced in the background with dimmed lighting, noise level was minimal which I loved. It's so classy and romantic here! Perfect for intimate outings. :)",

We we're not that hungry, but because we were near, we decided to stop in at the bar and try it out.   We only tried four apps, which was plenty for us. The couple next to us, suggested the Jumbo lump crab lettuce cups. Great crabmeat and crispy lettuce, No complaint on the freshness, just very simple to the point that you wanted something more. It needed a touch of lemon or yuzu aioli or just something to bring it together. A little more thought into this dish, and it would have been great.   We tried the the Salmon sashimi tostada. This was also good, but simple. Although 3 small pieces for $15 seemed to be a bit steep, even at Vegas prices.   We sampled the Bacon wrapped dates, with blue cheese fondue. Wrapped dates with a blue cheese dipping sauce. Pass on this one. You've seen it a bunch of times. It's tired.  Finished with the Diver sea scallops on polenta cake. Very good.  La Cave deserves another try. I'm sure there's plenty of dishes that would blow me away. The apps, although good, were just not knock you off the stool great.   They have a very aggressive wine list, and lots of wine by the glass, but the wines are definitely not cheap. I know, it's Vegas, and it's the Wynn, but it would be nice to not be gouged on wine, at every place on the strip. But I guess that makes them all consistent I guess.",

Their selection is great and they have the best wine flights I have ever had. Personally, I only order from their wine flights, so that I can get a few different tastes of the wines I like versus just focusing on one.  Their Sunday Brunch is truly an experience. Everything is served in small plates, and there is no menu. Waiters just continue to come by with different options and you can get as many different things as you like. For $30 you can also add bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's or Caipirinhas. Overall, an awesome deal for the quality and quantity you get. (Just ask my mother in law and her sister, who in their 70's can throw back more of these drinks than any 20-something.)  If it is a nice day, make sure to ask to sit out on the patio. It is gorgeous!",

It was 112 degrees that day but they had water misters all throughout the patio which kept us cool.   Our group of 3 shared the following dishes and really enjoyed each one: Salmon Sashimi Tostada - refreshing combination of ingredients Mini Burgers - the beef was perfectly cooked and juicy! Bacon and Egg Fettucini - very flavorful and rich  Beet and Cheese Dish (I forget the name) - it came out in a cute mini cast iron pan and was the perfect summer dish! This was perfect to hold us over until our dinner reservation.  The service was great and the food came out quickly.",

    "text": "La cave is a restaurant located in the Wynn that serves interesting tapas.   We started with crab rolls in lettuce, which I thought were tasty but under seasoned. Overall a forgettable dish.   Next came the Wagyu slider on zucchini, which was juicy and delicious. I wholeheartedly recommend this dish.   Next came the carbonara with sunny side up egg and fried prosciutto. the prosciutto was delicious; crispy and salty, but the rest of the dish fell short. The pasta was delightfully chewy, and the egg was well cooked, but the dish felt under seasoned overall. This is the second time I felt that the seasoning was off.   Next came the scallop and polenta. The scallop was incredible--cooked and seasoned to perfection, but the polenta was flaky and again under seasoned. It was cooked well, however.   Next came the Thai snapper ceviche with lotus root. The root was crispy and light, and the fish Ceviche was an excellent pair. I felt the overall flavour was safe, not exciting.   The beef filet was well cooked, but again the flavours were on the safe side. The blue cheese was a good compliment, and the truffle cream was on the sour side. Well cooked, average seasoning    We rounded off the meal with a charcuterie plate of sopressata, prosciutto, and aged Gouda. This was the best dish of the meal. Lavash, aged Gouda, and the jam, combined with the cured meats created an incredible flavour medley unlike anything I've ever had.  The last dish alone bumped this review from 3-4, along with amazing attentive service and an enjoyable, laid back environment. For the cost, I feel the food was held back in one way or another, which kept La Cave from scoring 5 stars with me. However, if you're a fan of tapas and fancy wine and cheese, be sure to stop by La Cave",

Boyfriend and I got seated and didn't even have one person come up to us for over 5 minutes. Almost got up and left. Cocktails were okay. At least you have options other than typical champagne during brunch. Stick with the white sangria, can't go wrong with that. Also, notice they'll obviously walk around with all the high carb, cheaper foods. Pretty sure pancakes came by our table over 15 times. None of the good stuff came until we asked them. Like I said, subpar service. Wouldn't recommend going here unless you wanna really blow $160 plus tip for two people and starve while you wait for the real food to come out.",

    "text": "We went to La Cave Wine and Food Hideaway on 9/13/18.  Our bill was $210 for 4 people -- the food was good, but let's face it this is still pretty expensive for a charcuterie board, 3 tapas, 1 desert, 1 alcoholic drink and one or two non-alcoholic drinks.  The price isn't what bothered us though.  As I said, our bill was $210, but when our waiter brought the bill and my husband's credit card back to the table, we were charged $185 -- it was a $25 difference, so while we wondered if it was a mistake and were going to ask, we also thought it might have been some sort of comp for some reason.  But then the waiter came back and asked for my husband's card again (which he still had out, just in case) -- the waiter had used the card to pay the wrong bill.  So now he charges us $210.  But what we didn't find out until the next morning was that the restaurant did not cancel the  previous authorization for $185.  The waiter never told us that would happen and no manager came to tell us this -- I guess we were just supposed to know this or something.  So my credit card sits there for 3-5 days with both charges on it, until the bank clears the authorization -- tying up an extra $185 of my money while we are on vacation -- while this may be no big deal for their usual clientele of millionaires and billionaires, it is a big deal to a regular person.  We didn't find out that both charges stayed on the card until the next morning, and when my husband called the restaurant and spoke to a manager, he basically could have cared less.  Yes, I got a \"Sorry\", but that was it.  My husband has built a Customer Experience program for a Fortune 200 company, and he was completely ticked off by this point.  Nothing but a sorry -- that is really sorry.  No offer to comp one of our dishes or the difference between the bills ($25) or the amount of the tip for the waiter who never told us anything about this happening ($42).  After mentioning this, the manager did provide a flippant offer to comp a drink, so my husband asked if that included the $2,500 bottle of wine on the menu -- no response.  I guess you have to be a millionaire or billionaire and/or a celebrity for La Cave or Wynn to care whether you had a positive customer experience.  If you are Joe Blow, you just don't matter enough for them to care about your customer experience.  Won't be going here again, and if you aren't a millionaire or billionaire and/or a celebrity, I suggest you don't go either -- this place just doesn't give a flying leap about the middle class -- it was obvious to us our customer experience just wasn't important to them.",

    "text": "The No1DP found this restaurant as a recommendation from the Encore concierge as a restaurant with portions and environment friendly for single travelers. Though it makes for the concierge to make a recommendation within the hotel, the No1DP had a nice meal out of it. When I joined him several days later he took me here on our first dinner date before the AWS re:Play party.  LOCATION: One of the restaurants that line the Wynn Esplanade, the shopping strip inside the Wynn/Encore.  We got to sit right next to the kitchen where all the hot items were grilled and the flatbreads were baked. We got to talk to one of the chefs and we witnessed how they prepared some of our food.   - Diver Sea Scallops, Polenta Cake, Shrimp Sauce ($18). Medium-sized juicy scallop with an equal portion of polenta, which is easily becoming one of my favorite presentations of cornmeal. The small plate is deceptive that eating the entire plate could get a person full quite quickly. - Mushroom Grits, Pecorino ($10). Though not a lot of mushrooms it had full of mushroom flavor. It was also the most carb-heavy dish so I was able to get more full because of my portion of grits. It's served in a cask-iron skillet to keep it hot.  - La Cave Caesar, Prosciutto, Lemon Anchovy Dressing ($11). Several stalks of lettuce doesn't make it a salad. It's essentially lettuce wrapped in prosciutto and served with a savory cream puff. It's a decent attempt at interpreting caesar salad as a small plate. - Prawns, Baby Corn, Long Beans, Chili Vinaigrette ($18). We got to see this made right in front of us from the grilling of shrimp to its final assembly of baby corn and long beans. This dish is meant to be eaten whole as the individual components are just average. Shrimps were a big portion. - Beef Filet, Caramelized Onions, Mushrooms, Blue Cheese Flatbread ($17). Our dining companion of the night offered me a slice of flatbread. The flour used is double zero, a high-quality flour used for making pastas and pizzas. I took a bite of the beef and it was soft yet packed with so much mushroom flavor. If the No1DP was used to eating beef he would certainly enjoy it. If dining for two flatbread can get you full quite quickly so we're glad in retrospect that we got non-flatbread dishes - it allowed us to try more small plates.  Server was knowledgable in our requests of wine glasses for the night. No1DP enjoyed his white while I was happily sipping my light Pinot Noir.   The place is definitely pricey (as is all Vegas establishments) but a reliably good restaurant for small plates.",

These American fusion-styled tapas are highly expensive for mediocre small portions of food. La Cave is tucked away inside the Wynn with modern industrial styles with really dark lighting.  My boyfriend and I went here for a friends birthday and were seated in the bar area which was really dark and busy. There was another room enclosed that could of been used for our 12 person party yet we were in the not-so-great area. Ask for the glass room for reservations and make sure to request a non-bar sitting area. At least the service was decent and the hostesses were helpful.  The wine list was extensive with reds, whites, dessert wines, sparkling, bubbly and even orange wines (still not sure what those entail?) that range from $16 to the hundreds by glass. The cucumber ginger cocktail was refreshing!   I ordered the Onion Soup for $12; it was alright. My boyfriend loves steak and always orders it,  so we always rate them 1-10! He ordered the skirt steak which was cut in pieces for $26 and gave it a 7 out of 10.  If you want to spend a bit less with top notch classic Tapas, go to Firefly Tapas on Paradise Road. Off of the Strip, it is well worth your time and money and your taste buds! (P.S. The steak was rated 11 there!)",

All other items smaller, tapas style. The menu offers a wide variety of healthy choices that are not too heavy or fatty. I really like the Wagyu -- sliced thinly, tender, and cooked perfectly medium rare. The fish are good too -- salmon and halibut were cooked well.

Usually I associate casino restaurants with the height of service, especially the Wynn, but the hostesses really chapped my ass.  My Wife & I were meeting family for dinner. We arrived a bit later than our family, so were trying to meet up asap. The hostesses did not greet persons going in before us, and were deep in convo. We looked at each other confused & assumed it was a casual place, so we took a step inside too. Maybe that's the etiquette here? No one asked us anything. We never intended to be rude barbarians. We saw our family waiting, when the hostess briskly walked up to us, physically blocked our path demanding, \"EXCUSE ME, CAN I HELP YOU, DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION!\". We felt so embarrassed - \"Yes, *surname here*, we have a reservation, that's our family right over there\". She wasn't believing still. Were we underdressed? Do we not belong? \"WELL, I CAN -TAKE- YOU THERE,\", she quipped.  K, B-tch, you do that. \"Hi & welcome\" also works well.  We felt so embarrassed & selfconscious as we sat down, not even an apology for the spectacle. Our family could see our upset.  Proceed to the waitress effing up our whole table's order & laying on the flirt with men at the table like spackle. I wouldn't have given a s*** if our order was correct, but she seriously missed like 3 entrees for the table. That's pretty bad. I understand it would be advantageous to flirt for a bachelor party or something, but it honestly made me & the other ladies at the table uncomfortable because it was all family & that man was our Dad, husband, brother, etc...and she was crouching down intimately...you get the idea.  Anyhow, the hostesses took the cake that night for making us feel like utter doodoo. Gracias.",

Pretty moderately priced too!  It's also got a nice patio.  Unfortunately since I didn't make a reservation for dinner, they sat me down at one of their bistro tables inside which still had a nice view of the pool outside.  I ordered their Roasted Salmon but knowing that it probably wouldn't be enough to fill me up, I went with my server's recommendation and ordered the Hamachi Cubes for my appetizer.  Hamachi Cubes -- Yuzu Aioli, Crispy Lemon Chip <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F11dvgs1&s=2d530581cd752f0948d5fc8a0bd0c69dd93dcd0a7f33fd4f5cae4add4070bd2f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/11dvgs1</a> Very fancy dish!

It was a pretty generous portion!  The salmon was cooked perfectly and I liked the vegetable pasta that went along with it.  While it may not look like much on the picture, it was a very hearty entree and I was very satisfied!  Service was exceptional and on point!  My server was very good and she always checked up on me and also very knowledgeable about the menu.  She definitely earned a nice tip!  Although I didn't get to eat out on the nice patio, I still had a nice dining experience at La Cave.  I must come back again to try their flatbreads and all the other entrees.  It's top notch dining on a very affordable budget!!  5 Stars!!",

The tables are too close together, I am not a fan of tables too close together when dining in an intimate setting. The food was very good. It's a great place to go to share lots of small dishes in a tapas style fashion.",

The food was incredible, the drinks were incredible, the service was outstanding. We ordered around 20 dishes brought out a few at a time, and sampled a large portion of the menu, and there wasn't a single item any of us were unhappy with. We ate and drank for at least 3 hours, and went back to our hotels stuffed to the max. Will have dinner again here next time we are in Vegas.",

We were staying at the Wynn (5 star review forthcoming) and decided to eat at La Cave since it's in the hotel.  I like the idea of small plates and sampling a lot of different things instead of one giant entree.    We both ordered the bacon and egg fettuccini and I think that came first.  It was very good.  The bf wolfed it down in a second.  I was savoring mine...Then he ordered the BBQ pulled pork flat bread.  DELICIOUS.  The pork was tender and not dry; it was full of flavor.  I ordered the mini burgers and every single bite of that was HEAVEN.  It was so perfectly seasoned...ever little bite I took.    To drink I ordered a red wine flight which I found to be very pleasant.  He ordered just a glass of zin and it was also in my flight.    I can't say enough good things abut the Wynn.  They do it up right.  Even us common-folks can enjoy a little slice of decadence.  It's great.",

    "text": "One of my favorite Sunday Vegas indulgences is the covered patio at La Cave.  When we have nowhere to be and nothing that has to be done I love spending a late afternoon enjoying the fantastic wine selection and watching the reflection of the sunset in the side of the bronze windows of the Wynn.  The service is just perfect.  The check in often enough to make sure our glasses are refreshed with cold Champagne, but give us enough room to get lost in conversation.    If you're lucky enough, you might score one of the swing seats along the far wall.  My personal favorite spot to sit is along the back wall on the long comfy couches, safely protected from the sun but not the views.  If brunch is your plan, they have a fun Sunday brunch that is served butler style.  Servers carry tapas style brunch dishes on serving platters and stop by to offer each table.  I like that the brunch is a set fee, so you can just relax and focus on the moment.  They also have a bottomless drink offering that includes multiple cocktails.  I must confess that their bloody mary needs some work.",

Even though most of place was empty, we had a hard time getting a table because the host said the table was reserved.. 2.5 hours later. We were finally able to argue we had a flight to catch and promised to be gone in 2 hours. That was fine, we had decent service and enjoyed the wine menu. The food was unremarkable though and wines by the glass list wasn't very special. We had several bottles of wine from the bottle list. And a few bland whites from the BTG list.  What happened next is what irks me, we had a bill of several hundred dollars and split the check 5 ways. Later when I got home I realized I was over charged on my card by over $10 on the tip, even though I left 22% tip for a mediocre guest experience. I called and they asked that I send a picture of the receipt and what not, which I did. I never heard anything back for almost a month and figured they fixed it because no one said anything. I checked my account and nothing, wrote asking why I still wasn't credited, and the manager wrote back saying \"he had called me and left a message saying I needed to call back with my cc#\".  Well I never got a call. I checked my missed calls for the past month and there's been nothing, plus my VM box has been full since October so it's impossible he ever left a message like he stated. I don't appreciate being lied to. And I don't understand why no one simply responded to my email for me to call back. Either way it was irritating and I called back and asked for the over charge as well as the rest of my tip to be refunded. He said that's impossible, none of it. Then offered no explanation or apology for what happened, for it taking so long to fix, for lying about calling and resolving the issue with the absolute bare minimum. Excellent job Aaron!",

Everything at La Cave was amazing - my girlfriends and I still talk about it fondly.  Walking to La Cave itself was such an experience. It is located inside the Wynn. We had to walk through the gorgeous hallways and then arrive at La Cave, where we were seated promptly.  We had ordered a whole array of tapas to share, including the roasted beets, bacon-wrapped dates, ceviche, salmon tostada, beef and blue cheese flatbread, sirloin steak, etc. Everything was incredibly delicious! Each one of us was in love with the food, including one or two picky eaters!  Three of us got a wine flight as well. I LOVE wine flights, and this one didnt disappoint! To pair with the wine flight, we ordered three types of cheese to share. Oh man, the portions we got! BIG pieces of cheese! We were all giddy with happiness because we thought we'd get an inch at most, considering what a reasonable price it was.   The service was super friendly and polite. We all had an amazing time laughing, sharing food and indulging in good wine. Thank you La Cave for the good memories and for making sure the last dinner on my bachelorette trip was a success! :)",

My 3 small tapas dishes came out to $50 (not including alcohol or tip). Luckily it was on the company's dime. If I were to visit here again, I'd do it more as a happy hour drink and appetizer type deal before a more substantial meal.",

They could only seat me at the bar or high-tables at the bar. Not my preference. At the end of the dinner, I walked to the back of the restaurant to see the patio.  To my surprise, there were plenty of people there, and it was enclosed with glass panels. There were certainly some empty tables where I could have been seated.  My server, Jennie was very pleasant. I had the bacon-wrapped dates ($14). Delicious, but could be a difficult meal if you were trying to impress a companion as the dates and bacon were stringy.  I also had the scallops ($18). They were moist and very good, but only two on a slaw that was not that impressive and with some unexpected bacon bits.  La Violette Viognier was very good ($16). Again, everything was a bit pricey for what I got.  Next time, I'll try the Happy Hour.   Very strange experience, none-the-less.",

    "text": "In a nutshell the food is great but omg the service is the slowest on earth.  I took my bestie here for her birthday since she's a vegan and Wynn restaurants are known for their amazing Vegan menus. The menu definitely didn't fail to impress us.  We each ordered 3-4 items, since it's \"tapas\" style, but that was a TON of food.  We could've probably gotten away with 1-2 items each.  My main complaint is how SLOW the service is.  When we were first seated, the server greeted us and took my drink order. It took quite a while for the drink to come. Shortly after, we ordered food, and that took at least 30 minutes to come.  When we were done eating, we sat there for at least 20 minutes waiting for our server to bring the check. No one ever came to ask if we wanted water, or how we were doing. I was soooo irritated because at this point we were super stuffed and all I wanted to do was leave and go home to curl up in the fetal position.  Our server was super nice, but it seemed like maybe she had too many tables to tend to because after she took my card to pay for the check, it took her at least 10 more minutes to come back. So basically we sat there for an additional 30 minutes just waiting to check out. Waiting and suffering with our food babies in our bellies.    If you're a Vegan and want to do a special night out, I'd definitely recommend it because they have great options and it's definitely a special occasion type of place. If you're not a Vegan, there's lots of other options with amazing food and much better/timelier service.",

Guests helped her back to her feet, but she was embarrassed and in pain the rest of the evening.  Nobody from the restaurant (and they all saw it) came to us and asked if she was okay, or if she would like anything at all.  So for that reason, I must withhold the 5th star.    Otherwise, this place is a must see.  Sit outside on the patio overlooking the garden and the Wynn hotel.  It's breathtaking.  Just watch your step inside!",

Our inability get coffee refills was very frustrating. The two refills we obtained only came after making special requests and the second time required an additional reminder. Our table was a small two top which did not leave a lot of room for extra plates. Getting leftover dishes removed required flagging Busboys- they were not taken automatically. I could chalk some of these up to uncertainty if a dish was finished, but there were many clearly ready to be taken away. After we had been sitting for almost an hour, there were three core breakfast dishes that we still had not seen. Upon mentioning this to our server she agreed to look into their status. The hash showed up promptly but the other two remaining dishes did not appear until 12 minutes later. (I know this because I began to start looking at my watch) By that point I was full and ready to leave but since the effort was made to get them to the table, I felt obliged to have at least a bite or two. They were good and I would have enjoyed them if the timing had been better. We then paid and started to leave. On the way out I encountered the manager. We made eye contact and I nodded unsmiling hoping he would ask how the experience was. He did acknowledge me, but only to say Happy Easter. This had all the makings of a great experience. Poor execution prevented it.",

I wouldn't steer people away from here - in fact, we will likely return to try them out for a later-in-the-day meal. But for brunch, this wouldn't crack my Top 10 list - there are simply too many other better options in the area.",

We were a group of 10 and the waiter couldn't get us individual checks and it took 30 minutes to bring us separate checks and lots of making faces because it was so inconvenient to him. And when we arrived the waiter asked if we got a table or seats and we said seats. One would think seats meant separate checks. And even worse the manager chased us down after we left for a missing credit card receipt. Yeah, that's because one of us paid with cash. The manager also yelled obscenities behind our back. Food was decent and wine was good but the service was terrible. With so many other great food options on the strip that have good service as well, there is not a way any of us will ever go back.",

I think I enjoyed their brunch menu more than their dinner menu.  For about $50, you can enjoy 16 butler-style table side items and for an additional $20, you get unlimited brunch cocktails (mimosa, sangria, Mojito, margarita, Bloody Mary, and caipiranha). About $30 for kids under 12. Servers with plates/trays of food go around the restaurant. We were sitting in front of the kitchen so, we always got first dibs on everything.  Items we got just for the heck of it (non mind-blowing but expectations weren't set high in the first place): Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Salad Fresh Fruit Salad Scrambled Eggs Angus Mini Burger Chorizo Sausage Cup Pancakes with Berry Compote Tomato Mozzarella Flatbread Veal Short Rib Hash  What we enjoyed and ate the most: Cornflake Crusted Brioche French Toast Mushroom Grits (I smelled truffles when the server passed by so, I had to have this!) Baked Potato Loaded Tater Tots with Brown Gravy (do you like Poutine?) Ham and Egg Flatbread (raw quail eggs) Eggs Benedict with Chorizo (one of the best eggs Benedict's I've ever consumed) Eggs Benedict with Filet (you can't go wrong with steak and eggs)  This is supposed to be a leisurely dining experience so, if you have to be somewhere at a certain time, go somewhere else. I like my Lazy Sundays so this was an excellent choice. Laidback, no worries...just sit, eat, sip and enjoy life!",

Another was scallops on fried polenta. The other was bacon and egg fettuccine  prosciutto. The last was mushroom grits with truffle and pecorino.  They were all very delicious. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly. Our view was simply divine. I think it was a perfect experience and I would definitely return to try out more of these little bites. This restaurant is back a little from the machines. You have to look for it. We had a table outside and were by ourselves for most of our meal. I have to say for my one venture outside of Palazzo that we did have a great time.",

As the name suggests, they have a dim \"hide away\" vibe that projects an understated and intimate elegance.   Our server was great - very attentive and polite. He knew the menu well and was able to make great recommendations.   The food at La Cave is easily some of the best in town. My party of three shared four dishes (tapas style) and they were all excellent. We had a field greens salad with champagne vinaigrette, tomato and mozzarella flatbread with capers, roasted salmon with green beans, and a chicken pesto pasta. Throughout the meal, we literally couldn't stop talking about how great everything was.   For a nice restaurant on the strip, the prices were quite reasonable. For the four dishes and a glass of wine each, it came out to about $45/person including tip.",

    "text": "Another small plates joint.  I love small plates and sharing.  I also love enomatic machines.  They ensure that the wine comes out at the right temperature.  Red wine is always served too warm.  I had the Blue-Eyed Boy Shiraz by Mollydooker and a nice Malbec.  Both were excellent.  Some of the wines are not served in the enomatic machine.  Make sure to order from the enomatic machine.  And ignore the $120 glass of wine.  I don't know what's up with that.  The rest of their wine is reasonably priced.  Our bartender, turned server as the night went on, was also excellent. Very attentive and anticipated our needs. We tried the bacon wrapped dates, mushroom grits, and the prosciutto flatbread.  I could have lived without the bacon-wrapped dates... too large and mushy. you have to cut them in half to eat them. The blue cheese fondue the dates came with didn't have much flavor to it.  I like Firefly's bacon-wrapped dates better with the almond in the middle for some crunch.  I think our bartender did too, because he asked if we'd tried Firefly's.  The mushroom grits were to die for... so tasty with the truffle oil.  I adore grits.  And the prosciutto flatbread was also very, very good.  Lots of prosciutto with arugula made for a nice balance of flavors.  The flatbread is huge compared to the other dishes, so beware.  The desserts were ok. There was a toasted poundcake with strawberry and sour cream ice cream that sounded great but turned out to be underwhelming.  The poundcake just tasted stale and the sour cream ice cream just tasted like vanilla.  We also tried the beignets which were just beignets.  Nothing to write home about.  I like the ambience, but I would suggest sitting farther away from the door.  Maybe at the bar in the back or at a table.  At one point, these kids coming from the pool in swimsuits decided to play in the revolving glass door... and the hostess and their mom let them.  In about 1 minute, one of the kids got slammed in the door by the other kids.  Screaming ensued. The mom couldn't figure out how to get the kid out of the revolving door for a while.  So annoying.  I think the hostess should have put a stop to that before it happened.  It was pretty predictable.  Later in the evening some drunk guys in t-shirts and shorts came in, falling all over the place and asking for Coors Light.  Charming.  Just get a table in the back if you are looking for ambiance that does not involve the regular Las Vegas tourist.   It's a cute spot that has potential.",

    "text": "Alright, first off, this is not a restaurant you go to and expect to eat your own meals. This restaurant is meant to be a really fancy take on family dinner. The food comes out on small plates in modest portions abs you are encouraged to share. So you are also encouraged to get a few plates of food not just one for yourself to enjoy as you would in a normal restaurant.   All that being said, this place is really good. With the portion sizes being small it isnt overwhelming and you don't leave over full. We had the chicken skewers, shrimp, Angus, and the benigets.   The chicken came on skewers with little toasted pita slices with a taziki sauce. (like the stuff you get on gyros) the chicken was moist and the sauce very good.   The shrimp was wonderful and the sauce was very creole in taste but not overly spicey.  The Angus came out about the size of a fist and cut into two pieces. It also was very flavorful but wasn't cooked as well as I could have been I think.  The benigets were small abs round, like a Mexican wedding cake, and came with a chocolate sauce, raspberry jam and a cream sauce I cannot place. All were just wonderful.   So if you're looking for something a little different with delicious food this is a good place to eat. If you're super hungry and not wanting share go someplace else.   Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu as there were a lot of words I didn't personally recognize on there lol.",

    "text": "Went there for dinner after attending the Wynn Showstoppers show. The venue was super nice - especially the terrace looking out to the frondous hotel grounds. We were however overall disappointed with the quality of the food. Our Gorgonzola salad tasted flat - quite the opposite of what you'd expect (desire) in a Gorgonzola dish - and some of the bits and pieces in it were hard to identify (whether by eyesight or by tastebuds). The ceviche was alright due to its fresh cilantro seasoning but otherwise lacked freshness and lemony zing. The mini burgers' meat was super tasty, but such taste was slightly damped by the mushroomy tapenade that coated it - and the bread was neutral in the palest possible way. The redeeming dish was definitely the tomato mozzarella and capers flatbread - flavorful and crisp although it would have benefited from being served a bit hotter to get more of the \"fresh out of the oven\" feel.  The wine list was extensive and it was a nice surprise to get a Verdejo option - I love this Spanish grape.  My margarita however tasted like anything but - not sure what they put in it but it felt more like drinking a watery mezcal mix. It may be that we weren't lucky with our food choices and I'd give this venue another try - just.",

We had everything from the beef filet crostini to the Gorgonzola salad, sliders, ceviche, onion soup, bacon wrapped dates, and three diff flatbreads- Thai chicken, steak and mushroom, and chorizo and sausage. All were completely up to par. Nice atmosphere and good food to compliment. The portions are all tapas but VERY filling and satisfying. Will definitely return. Beignets were decent but the smores flatbread was amazing not overly rich but absolutely got the point across. We had two young kids With us and even though my kids do extremely well I think it's more suitable for adults for sure, it's just more intimidate yet casual. Good for some wine and tapas with friends or a nice date night. If u do happen have children with you, they definitely cater just fine and don't make you feel out of place.",

The best part about coming with a big group (we had 8) is being able to basically sample the whole menu...which we pretty much did. That being said, La Cave is a place that I like to classify as a great \"girls night\" restaurant because the tapas sized portions don't really compare to a good ol' steak and eggs at Buffalo Bills; unless you're willing to drop $70+ on food per person (not including drinks), you probably won't leave full.  Expect to order at least 2 of every dish if you have a party of more than 5.  The food was excellent overall. Some of my favourites were the bacon, egg, and fontina flatbread, the diver sea scallops, and the short rib cavatelli (which in a twisted way tasted like Chef Boyardee's beefaroni, but in the best way possible). Another big hit was the beignets, or more specifically, the creme anglaise that came with it....long after the beignets were gone, we were still scraping up the creme anglaise. Some \"meh\" dishes were the shrimp with piquillo peppers, the jumbo crab lettuce cups, and the bacon wrapped dates, but I only say they're \"meh\" because they didn't do these dishes any better than anywhere else that serves them.   Because the menu is extensive and the portions small, your best bet would be to ask the waiter for his/her recommendations and take it from there. Hopefully, your waiter will be a bit more opinionated than ours (when we asked her for recommendations, she waffled on every suggestion so I ended up taking the reins and ordering everything myself).",

She tells us they don't have any tables so we'll have to sit outside until something becomes available.  Waitress comes out and could care less that we are unhappy.  After half an hour we finally give up and just decide to eat outside.  An hour later as we're half way through our entrees she comes out with \"Great news!  We have a table inside!\"  Are you freakin kidding me?  We all laugh and say forget it.  No apology, no free drink, nothing.  Will not be returning to drop another $500 to sweat through dinner and feel totally unappreciated.",

    "text": "I'm a sucker for a good wine bar, and this place is now in the running for my favorite one in Vegas!   *Atmosphere - we sat in the beautiful back \"sun room\". It had an almost Moroccan feel to it with nice brown tones and a huge planter built into the wall overflowing with greenery. Floor to ceiling windows, comfy furniture.. I loved it! It was a nice contrast from the more cave-like room in the front.   *Wine - The wines by the glass weren't all that exciting to me, but we had a couple of half bottles. They were stupid expensive ($50?), but it's the Wynn, I can't say I was surprised.   *Staff - weird, honestly. The waiter was aloof and the hostess had to get my name and whether I was staying at the Wynn or not down on some piece of paper before I was allowed to sit down in the empty restaurant. We were also told we could only have the table for an hour, but whatever. The bus boys tried to pick up our water glasses and remove them several times. It was bordering on silly.   *Food - I adore meat and cheese and this place had a phenomenal meat and cheese list. Reasonable portions were $5 or so, not all that bad. We had an aged gouda, proscuitto, and truffled goat cheese. Seriously some of the best cheese I've ever had! So freaking yummy.   This was a great place for a pre-dinner drink and snack, but would also be a fun place to end the evening. Sexy enough for a date, but also fun for a group of ladies - one of my new favorite spots to drink on the strip.",

    "text": "Had lunch here on a Friday afternoon ...  Ok.. so what's up with needing my first and last name before seating me?  It's not like it was used in any way to speak to me during my visit here.  Anyways...  SCENE:  Great vibe... really cool bar in the front area... cool bar in the back area Low lighting, dark, modern, upscale cave like feel... kinda romantic without being gushy...I guess you might call it 'casual-intimate'.  Good place to hang out with friends or work friends ...but not a good place for a power lunch.  There's a patio area with nice looking couches, chairs, tables, live plants, and really nice (fancy) looking hammock chairs.  They just begged to be sat in with a glass of wine and enjoy the day.  However, it was a bit chilly and they didn't have outdoor heaters out there so we sat inside.  SERVICE:  For a Wynn establishment... I expected more / better.  I'm not saying it was 'Bad'... it was just Mediocre which is NOT how you would think anything at Wynn would be.  We were sat immediately but the wine menu was not part of the menus provided.  I mean... they give you an additional menu that is sorted by Gluten-Free or Dairy-Free or Meat-Free, etc.... but they don't give you a Wine menu?  Hello... you're surrounded by wine and isn't this supposed to be like a really nice wine bar?  So... after waiting for 5-7 minutes to gain the attention of anyone... we asked for a wine menu.  And it's a very nice wine menu.... not ridiculously priced and they have a good selection of different priced wines.   We ended up ordering a glass each... by the glass ranges from about $10-20 depending.  Not cheap... Not atrocious.  FOOD: The Fiery Artichoke Flatbread is FANTASTIC!  Comes with fresh ricotta, roasted red peppers, pepperocini and of course artichokes.  The flavors went really well together and the ricotta was like butter.  The bread itself was perfect!  Not dough-y and not tough.  The Beet dish is really good... very rich because of the melted goat cheese, but so YUMMY!  The beets were juicy yet firm.  The Asparagus dish was 'ok'... I don't think I'd order it again... it came with shaved hard boiled egg and crispy pancetta.  It sounded good on the menu but the flavors did not blend together well.  And they put some sort of lemon or citrus sauce on it which made it too sour-like.  The Dates were 'ok'..... I've had better.  I think it's because the bacon they used was not of the Applewood Smoke type and that the blue cheese fondue (on the side) was really runny.... versus being melted inside the date.  Anyways...overall... Yes, it's a bit pricey... $76 b/4 tax... for 2 people with a glass of wine each... but it's a really lovely meal.  If I go back... I intend on sitting on the patio and being able to savor the experience better.",

    "text": "Per my galpal from Colorado's request to try a fine-dining meal together during her visit to Vegas, I did my research and thanks to these magnificent yelpers for their recommendations, we ended up opting for La Cave at the Wynn for dinner.   We were tight with time and had quite a struggle getting a ringside table at Olives (located at the Bellagio) because apparently, making a reservation in the morning doesn't guarantee you a spot for the night. It's just that in demand! So we stuck with a 10pm reservation there and a 7:15pm reservation here at La Cave. As the day progressed (this was on Saturday), we had to buy more time to squeeze in other stuff to do for the day and realized we would not be able to make it in time here. Fortunately, La Cave had another opening at 9pm and were accomodating enough to push us back, plus leave our table open for 15-20 minutes to make it even more flexible. We got there just in time to be welcomed by some friendly usherettes who led us to a nice high table in the most cozy-looking restaurant, dimly lit with lines and lines of wine bottles ranging from varieties made as recent as last year to vintage wine (I think the most expensive bottle I saw was priced at almost $500)  We enjoyed the most nicely presented food I've ever seen (Naturally, considering this was my first fine-dining experience). The portions were just as cute, enough to fill our tummies. And to think that I should've splurged at this opportunity, I actually ended up with a health-conscious choice of roasted salmon with vegetable pasta and yellow tomato broth for $16. That and a glass of water. Our server was patient enough to split our checks for the night and we were prepped and contented. Was a long night of great conversations despite the chitter-chatter in the background seeing as how the restaurant was packed. The atmosphere had such a classy vibe to it, totally worth dressing up for.",

    "text": "The bf and I wanted to find a wine bar during our trip to Vegas and after reading various yelp reviews, we decided to go to La Cave at the Wynn.  I called to make sure I didn't need a reservation for a Thurs at 7:30 pm.  The phone rang for awhile and I almost gave up but someone finally answered and was very friendly and said we should definitely make a reservation.  They asked about dietary restrictions and I said I was a vegetarian but I'd already found things on the menu I wanted and I was informed they have a vegan/vegetarian menu.  Now, we arrived 30 minutes late thanks to the monorail/shuttle service no longer offering a stop at the Wynn...and I was wearing heels having not expected to be walking for 20 minutes.  By the time we reached the Wynn, I had extremely painful blisters on both my big toes and was not in the mood for anything.  Seriously, you want me to be a heinous b*tch, put me in uncomfortable shoes, and make sure I'm late for something and starving.  Thankfully, despite our lateness, they said they could get us a table in 10 minutes and we could wait at the bar.  We plopped down at the bar and started to go over the extensive drink menu and were about to order something at the bar when they told us our table was ready.  Our server Desiree came over to greet us very quickly and asked if we'd dined there before.  She explained the portion sizes (they are \"made to be shared\" more like tapas) and the flatbreads are 8-10 pieces.  I asked for the Veg-friendly menu and was tempted to try the mushroom tortellini with cashew cream sauce but I don't like mushrooms enough to go on that adventure.  We decided to split the wine flight of white wines that was $20 for 4: Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Moscato, and Chenin Blanc.  The presentation of the wines was very cute...a long wood block with small cupholders built in labeled I through IV in order of the lightest to the most full-bodied.  Our server explained this and left the wine menu there for us to observe as we drank.  I noticed she got a few other tables around the same time one of which was larger.  Another staff member came to check on us to make sure we were doing ok in our server's absence.    The only issue I really had with the place in general was the music.  It was kind of club-style dance music and it seemed wrongly placed for an intimate wine bar.  My bf and I couldn't really have too much conversation in there because of it.  We started by ordering salads: the Mixed greens salad and the 3 bean salad.  my mixed greens salad was ok but the 3 bean salad was awesome and I wish I had gotten that.  The crunchy chickpeas were my favorite part.  For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the onion soup in puff pastry with gruyere and I ordered the fiery artichoke, roasted red pepper, artichoke flatbread with goat cheese.  Neither of us minded not being able to talk much once those two items came.  My bf was practically licking the bowl by the end and I was enjoying the fiery burn of the spicy peppers.  We wanted dessert and afterdinner drinks so we asked for the dessert menu.  My bf had already ordered a cappuccino which was unfortunate because there was a tasty caramel-coffee drink on the alcoholic drinks menu that he would have ordered had he waited for the dessert menu to get to the table.  I ordered the Spiked hot chocolate which tasted like liquid tiramisu.  YUM!  We decided to try the basil and mint infused creme brulee and our server made sure that we understood it had the herbs because clearly she'd had a customer complain about this in the past.  Kudos to our server for checking!  When we got it, the dessert looked like it was cooked properly and the sugar had a nice crack when we dug into it.  The first bite was VERY herbaceous and I probably could have done with just one herb.  The combo of the two was a bit overpowering, but the diced strawberries broke up the savory aspect a bit.  By the end I was wanting more.  Our bill all together was about $104, not bad for a nice sit-down dinner in Vegas.  Great experience!",

I must say, this place is amazing!  We reserved the outside patio (gorgeous view) and had such a wonderful experience.  The staff was beyond friendly and helpful.  My husband and I got there earlier than expected and they had everything ready for us and even let us sit early too! Our time max was 2 hours, of course we went over that limit, but we were not rushed at all.  The managers kept checking up on us without being over bearing.  This restaurant was exactly what we wanted.  Thank you staff and management at La Cave!! This was such a wonderful experience.",

Still giving this place three stars because service from the wait staff is always incredible and the food is impeccable-- even with the strip price. But the hosts here are rude and left a sour taste in my mouth this trip.  We came on a Monday night without a reservation which I wouldn't expect to be very busy. The host told it would be a 10 minute wait. That seemed logically until I asked to sit at the bar until our table was ready and there was no one in the restaurant. Host forgot about us after 20 min of being at the bar. We asked her how much longer till the table would be ready and said said give me a second with a rude tone like we interrupted her conversation with the other host. She finally took us to a table but with no menus. Never came back to offer us any, not even a wine list.   Recovery point: our waiter Brendan was the best. He was fun, energetic, and didn't seem like we were bothering him unlike the host. Immediately offered us great food and alcohol options. We got our food very quickly like always and tasted just as great as last time. Everything is tapas here so we ordered a bunch of food including the chicken flat bread, fehttuchini, beef carpaccio, kale salad, sliders, and the pork belly-- all great. Atmosphere is like an old wine cellar which is a nice and cosy feel for a romantic night out. Patio is lit beautifully from the Encore hotel and overlooks the pool.  If you don't mind a rude host ruining the first part of your night, this place is INCREDIBLE. I've never been disappointed until this time around.",

The Beets with goat cheese was not bad at all, but the seafood we tried was sub-par. The salmon sashimi tostadas was not sashimi but smoked salmon and it tasted funny because it just don't go together with the sauce they serve. I wonder if they ran out of sashimi and just put smoked salmon and hoped we wouldn't notice? Maybe an error in the kitchen? I don't know.  Our white sangria was actually wine spritzer with 3 pieces of fresh fruit in it. They charge $15 for that. Come on guys!!!  Nice crowd, nice atmosphere and good vibe, good service but the food was just not good. They need to try a little harder.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to try La Cave for a belated birthday dinner celebration after reading the rave reviews on yelp and other sites.  We are longtime Vegas vacationers who love staying at the Wynn because we appreciate their high standards, quality amenities and top-notch service, and love to frequent their excellent restaurants.  It started out fairly well--the greeters at the door welcomed us and seated us quickly, and our server came and took our drink order.  All of the restaurant staff was impeccably attired and gave me the feeling that this was going to be a good evening.  While walking to our table, we noticed that most of the employees were busy chatting away with each other instead of working or doting of their customers, and most of them avoided eye contact or any kind of acknowledgement of us--yes, we WERE properly attired.  The restaurant was very stylish and clean, and our table for two was set very romantically and the ambient lighting was perfect.  However, the huge flatscreen TV on the wall blaring out a March Madness college basketball game was confusing and somewhat of an eye (and ear) sore, since we wanted to dine in a cozy, romantic restaurant--not a sports bar.  Our drinks were came quickly and were really good--I had the Rince Cochon, a strong Belgian ale, while my wife had a glass of Eckstein Riesling.  Our server asked if we were ready to order, but we were unfamiliar with their offerings and requested a little more time.  Well, I finished over half of my beer by the time she finally reappeared to take our food order.  We had a small order since we needed to get to a show after dinner, so we ordered the jumbo lump crab lettuce cups, warm salt-roasted beets, chicken flatbread and the beef filet.  The crab lettuce cups came out first--full of succulent lump crabmeat, topped with small wedges of mandarin orange and pink grapefruit--very tasty and refreshing!  Next, the chicken flatbread and beef filet--the flatbread was very generous and filling, the exotic seasonings and hearty portion of chicken made it most delicious and a worthwhile experience, while the beef filet was savory and rich, sitting on crostini soaked with those delicious beef juices, topped with blue cheese and cooked to a perfect medium.  After we finished the three dishes and our drinks, we patiently waited for another 10 minutes before our server showed up and asked if we were ready for dessert.  I quietly mentioned to her that she forgot the roasted beets, so she said she would check on them.  Wait 5 more minutes, then she comes back and says she forgot the beets but if I still wanted them \"the guys could throw them on the grill\"--what?!  I was still hungry (these ARE small plates, after all) so I said I did want them.  Another 10+ minutes later, the beets finally show up, but it is kinda sad sitting and eating beets with nothing else to munch on with it. So I quickly ate most of the beets and asked for the check, since we still had a show to attend and our discombobulated meal took over 75 minutes to consume.  To my surprise, I was charged for the beets!  We wanted to speak to a manager about our disappointing experience, but needed to rush out of the restaurant to get to the show at The Orleans in time, which we did with just minutes to spare.  So I would rate La Cave the following:  FOOD:  4 stars-excellent quality, but very expensive for small plates.  AMBIENCE:  3 stars-nice atmosphere and lighting, staff dressed very well, but sports-bar TV's killed it.  PRESENTATION:  4 stars-very professional, clean and stylish.  SERVICE:  1 star-extremely disappointing for a Wynn restaurant; too long wait times for food and service followup; felt server wanted to rush us out.  To say we were disappointed is an understatement, because the food offerings and the restaurant itself were wonderful.  Hope La Cave can clean up their service issues, because there are a lot of other options, both on- and off-property.",

    "text": "We celebrated my husband's birthday with about 24 of our friends last Friday.  We originally reserved the patio area but realized that it was completely outside not indoor/outdoor like the picture on the website.  We explained our confusion to the manager and he accommodated us by seating us inside the garden room.  It was quite the ordeal to move all of us inside and re-arrange several other parties to make room for us.    The service was superb and the food was absolutely amazing.  There were a number of people that are foodies in our group and everyone of them gave the place a thumbs up.  I would highly recommend this place and would definitely come back again.  Thanks so much for the service crew working Friday night.  You made our event very memorable and special!",

La Cave has become a must do when in Vegas..now that they added a Sunday brunch I will definitely be stopping in then as well.  The place is beautiful, if your lucky enough to sit on the patio, just sit back and enjoy.  The wine flights are reasonably priced and come with some awesome wines..The appetizer plates are good enough to share, yet they are so good I hate sharing..  We also stopped in on a sunday one day and our friends showed up with their 18 month old child..The chef came out to ask what he could cook for him and within 10 minutes they had his food ready..This goes beyond customer service, such a nice gesture and such great service all around..",

    "text": "La Cave has excellent service, an elegant and chic atmosphere, innovative and delicious dishes and an amazing wine selection with brilliant sommeliers. All-in-all I had a wonderful dining experience and for a very fair price.   Thai Snapper Ceviche-this was my favorite dish; bright and light flavors with a subtle heat Ahi Tuna w/ fruit salsa- had a great spiciness to awaken your taste buds Sunny side up egg w/ serrano ham & asparagus-crispy ham and a friend egg over toast was simply delicious Bacon wrapped dates-everything I hoped they would be: sweet & salty & crunchy & chewy Raclette- heart warming and flavorful gooey-cheesy baked Swiss dish Mixed greens salad- great combination of acidity and earthiness  Roasted beets w/ whipped goat cheese and pistachio-my favorite vegetable dish  Diver sea scallops atop a polenta cake- great textures and flavors, a must-order! Beef filet with crostini & blue cheese- classically delicious and perfectly cooked S'mores flat bread- sweet, chewy and rich--a great way to end the meal!  With all this food and wine, we were stuffed! This restaurant is a cozy, beautiful sanctuary in the Wynn...I can't wait to return!",

    "text": "My visit here Sunday eve. was similar to dating a gorgeous jerk. Atmosphere, service (attentive) and wine options were great and expectations high(based on looks)... but half the tapas I tried were poorly executed.   Drinks: a tasty (affordable-like all their wine/cocktails in general) glass of Chenin Blanc(cheapest I've ever seen, but from S. Africa), then a good moscato. Wine flights here are fairly priced as well and offer grouping or individual tastings as an authentic wine bar should. The wine, cocktail and bubbly lists are amazing and the wine list is esp. eclectic.  Tapas:  First up, a delicious gorgonzola salad w/ crunchy proscuitto and delicious dates. Best salad ever. Yay! Finally, a great meal to impress my friends visiting the strip!.... then s%!t starts tasting very cheap very fast:     The onion \"puff\" pastry soup came out within one minute and tasted like it had been under a heater or overcoooked(burnt, rubbery crust, sans any puffiness or flakiness to its texture). The scallops were tasty and perfectly cooked. I wasn't sure what to think.  Then came the stuffed chicken... very overcooked... unforgivable?(should we break up; I just didn't know what to say... like all the others, huh?).   The filet with blue cheese was flavorful and met expectations, even though my medium rare was probably medium. Proscuitto di parma was great-a therapy session to address my unstable joy-then aged gouda was served with a delicious raspberry jam but also with the most stale crostinis I've ever tasted. These were obviously not prepared of me but for some other guy who'd stopped by earlier, or maybe for anyone with mullah-typical. I only ate the crust for its mild crispiness.   The flatbread dishes looked/sound creative and appealing but I was not in the mood.  Dessert: They offer a beignet, but one friend suggested we share the crepe. YUCK... they sent out that one joke-on-a-plate, where the chef has reinvented the crepe as a cold (\"deconstructed\")one w/ flavorless, unripe fruit that makes italian desserts overly sweet by comparison... we(all french) each took a bite and smirked. I've enjoyed similar crepes before at a ton of other places, but this one sucked... no honey/sauce /nothing on the plate was on the same page.  To be fair, this place is cheaper and far more chic than the the Bellagio's Pettrosian or those cheesy bars at the palazzo/venetian. Predictably, I plan to return to this sexy spot for wine and maybe try a couple dishes but nothing serious. Maybe I'll ease in w/ sunday brunch. I just need time. I regretted not going to the encore's (consistently fabulous) lobby bar.  They should definitely cut their menu in half and master a smaller # of dishes.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner before La Reve since they are both conveniently located at the Wynn hotel and left full and satisfied. The place has a unique modern cave like atmosphere and it was definitely cozy inside. Service was excellent as our server was not overwhelming and allowed us to take our time picking their tapas like menu items. Everything I tried was absolutely delicious, but nothing compared to their phenomenal bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese fondue, it was to die for. My husband who is a okay about most food in general, was like 'these are amazing.\" So that has to tell you something. These are a must get! I had the mini burger sliders and they were prepared excellently, perfect combo of bread and meat. Plus, they were also served with a little tomato vinaigrette salad which was really refreshing. My  hubby had the sirloin with mushrooms and he really liked the way it was prepared in a plum like sauce, super tasty as I had a bite.   All other items that our friends had including the flatbread, the veal, the garlic shrimp, they seemed to enjoy it all. Plus the beer was served in these fun glasses, very cool in my opinion. But only reason for not giving them 5 stars is that I felt that the dessert menu was a little limited. My friends had the s'mores flatbread and they seemed to enjoy that but that's not really my thing, the only crust on s'mores should be graham cracker not pizza dough. Oh well, but if I stay in the Wynn next time, I will definitely come here again as it was super tasty, nice ambiance and great service.",

    "text": "Wonderful little gem inside the Wynn hotel.  We arrived late afternoon to the hotel, too late for lunch but not early enough for dinner, so we popped in for a glass of wine and some cicchetti, and were very pleasantly surprised!   A very extensive list of wines by the glass, and some very nice flights.  We tried a nice flight of Italians (2 whites and 3 reds) then settled on one to stick with.  Food wise, the bacon wrapped dates were excellent, salty, sweet and crunchy all at the same time, and the blue cheese fondue was an interesting twist on this dish.  The sunny side egg was a show stealer, wonderful soft fried egg with some crisped up serrano ham and still crunchy asparagus.  A delightful dish!  We were impressed enough that later that same weekend, we came by for the sunday brunch.  This was also a unique take, with most of the food being passed \"butler style\" as they call it, rather than at a traditional buffet.  Huge selection of different dishes, from breakfast sandwiches to duck hash to freshly made pizza.  Pair that with bottomless mimosas and we were in good shape!  The room itself is also very nice, with a wine cave sort of effect as you come in, but a very nice open air patio in the back looking out on the Wynn grounds.   And the wait staff was excellent on both visits.",
