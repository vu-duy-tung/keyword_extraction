The meat was okay, they seem a bit stingy, and the tacos were almost 3 bucks a piece.  The sauce was not as good as TJ guac, and the hot sauce was a little bit bland.  I guess being sober I just didn't enjoy this place too much, but if you have not tried a authenthic mexican taco this is somewhat close, but much more pricey, and not as good as expected.",

    "text": "Where has Tacos El Gordo been my entire life??? Honestly this might sound crazy but I am not a huge taco person but I can honestly say after having tacos here I am hooked! Their abodabas tacos are freaking bomb dot com unbelievably delicious. Spicy pork prepared and sliced sharama style so tender and flavorful oh my god! I like mine on flour tortillas and topped with grilled pineapple  they make their tortillas fresh in front of you from dough to pressing it and then cooking it in front of you! Their lengua tacos (cow tongue) are absolutely delicious and full of beautiful flavor! Super tender and I now love cow tongue because of their tacos here! When you come here you have to order the tacos in different lines depending on the meat of your choice! The carne Asada line is the longest line because their carne asada is hands down heaven wrapped in the most beautiful taco! I will be back asap! I love you guys and the way your tacos have touched my heart forever! I'm a better person because of your tacos",

    "text": "THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!  I ate in stunned silence soaking in the mix of favors, aromas, sights and sounds.  This is yet another example of the inescapable rule - if you see all of God's children flocking into a restaurant indifferent of race or socioeconomic class - go in, take it in and EAT WITH THEM - the world would be a better place!  This place is incredible... The taco standard hence forth!  The only thing that would make this more authentic would be to move all to Cabo and put in on wagon behind a truck!    Ok... So down to the glorious details...  When you first walk in you see that you can order various item at different stations from around counter, but if you're a newbie have no fear, just ask someone and they'll be super happy to yell to the right part of the kitchen with what you want.  After your attention is averted from the large menu (not that there's a lot on it... It's just huge!), you notice 2 massive rotisseries with layer upon layer seasoned pork, Al Pastor topped with a signature pineapple.  Much like Gyros or Shawarma, Al Pastor, the Mexican version of the same is serious indicator of being in place that cherishes flavor and authenticity.  Unlike the other two meats, how Al Pastor is seasoned varies widely based on he tradition and locality of those making it... Which always makes it somewhat of an anticipated reveal!  This al pastor was highlighted with a very mild version of its common seasoning namely Guajillo, ancho, cumin, garlic onion, and pineapple allowing the charred meat shine through a bit more on its own.  Seared in the traditional manner with cilantro and onions on soft FRESHLY MADE corn tortilla only made it that much better!  The carne asada tacos were even better which was honestly hard to believe even possible!  The lightly seasoned and thinly sliced steaks are flash grilled over a fire that defies the term HOT to be then placed in a warming container next to the girl where magic clearly happens here.  The steaks, being close to the grill, continue to slow cook and steep in the smoky sooty goodness from the grill making hands down THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN!  Check out my pics ...  The tacos are generous and juicy.  Tortillas are all freshly made.    No matter what you do in Vegas, this will be one of the highlights... If I'm wrong call me out... If I'm right, just smile and pass it forward !",

Instead of 1area to order,you go to 4 different stations and then to the cashier to pay, so confusing and time consuming. We tried the carne asada,cabeza,lengua,tripa, carne asada fries and quesadilla. The tacos are typical,no special sauce or flavor. The fries was sort of a disaster-the cheese don't melt onto the fries(maybe not hot enough?),they use thin fries, the meat was ok but a little dry.  The interior of the place was not also well airconditioned,it was super hot, outside it was also hot. We tried it out of curiosity but once you know it's hype and disorganization, rather than the quality of food,it feels like a gimmick and is quite disappointing",

Ordered 10 al pastor tacos, an order of Carne Asada fries and we chowed down. Comes with a plate of grilled onions and hot peppers. Everything was really terrific. Oh yeah, the whole meal cost us 46 bucks. We could've paid that for a couple slices of pizza if we stayed in the Wynn. My advice to all of you is when it's drunk, hungry time get your butt in gear and walk up to this great taco shop and stuff your face. It's great.",

I as on the opposite side of the strip, so I called for a ride share. My driver also recommended it, after seeing that I was headed there. So, this place had a lot to look up to. I am happy to say that it did! I was a little taken back when I walked into the building, but quickly figured out how to order food. You figure out what taco meat you want, then goto the area that happens to prepare that meat. After collecting all the tacos you want, you then go to the register and pay. It wasn't that crowded when I went in there at 8pm, but I could see how this structure could move people through the lines at a faster pace than a standard 1 counter set up. What I really like bout the place, is the selection of meats. I got a cabeza (beef head), lengua (beef tongue), and Tripa (beef guts) Tacos. They were very, very tasty! At $2.25+ a taco, the price is a little high, but being on the strip, it's still a lot lower than most restaurants in the area.",

I saw pics that other tacos had it on but my other tacos only had onions and cilantro which didn't make them \"great\" or \"better\" than other taquerias I have attended. Tacos are small and expensive. They are fresh so that is good. We were in line a good hour and a half.  Three separate lines for anything so it sucks not to know this ahead of time.  One for adobada and al pastor, another for asada and I don't know what else, and another for lengua and cabeza, etc. Worth making a long line for them? Not in my opinion! The only thing I would go back for is the adobada tacos and I guess my husband liked the Al Pastor.",

There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it.   Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.        1. Carne Asada and Chorizo       2. Adobada      3. All the other stuff This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!  I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos.  The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.    If you want the best cheap eats on the strip, I don't think you have to look much further than Tacos El Gordo.

Try: Asada Sudadero  Pro: There's little else to be said except they make excellent tacos, fast. Definitely a great place to pop by for a quick snack, and they have a good variety of meat. (Not good for vegetarians)  Con: The lines are long, especially for their more popular meets due to their unique ordering system (lines by meat type). The place is very dingy, but depending on your point of view, can add to the authentic experience. It's a little pricy for what it is, but decent for Vegas.",

I believe the wait was almost one hour on a Saturday's night.   I think someone needs to come up with a better system. I had to stand in three different lines and that didn't include the line to pay. If they can't change the system, you got to change your game plan. You just need to remember to bring three friends, at least, with you so everyone can be in different ordering lines.    After all that, this is one of the best al pastor tacos, I have ever had. Don't forget to have them cut a piece of pineapple with your tacos. The combo of the two is delicious. I have been cravings for one or ten for months now.",

Tried a Suadero (beef brisket) Mula (2 corn tortillas stacked with cheese && meat inside) bomb! Wasn't a fan of the guac sauce or the carne Asada it was a little dry for me. This place is one of my favorite spots, the buche was so flavorful and the alpastor was traditional with all the spices and pineapple cooking with it as it spins. Here's a tip, the lines are huge, like atleast an hour wait but if you don't want Asada you don't have to wait in line! You can let them know you want a different meat && they'll let you inside. Asada is usually the longest line, then there's an Al pastor line, then there's the last line that's serves buche, lengua, cabeza, suadero and tripa. They also have a section where you can get grilled onions and grilled jalapenos. Must TRY!",

    "text": "If you are looking for the best tacos along the Las Vegas Strip, Tacos El Gordo is the place to go. The menu is relatively simple - tacos, fries, and a few other entrees. However, there are a few different types of pork and beef options to go with your food. The ordering process seems a little chaotic, but it is actually pretty simple once you figure it out. There are different lines depending on what meat you are ordering. Get in line. Place your order. Make sure you grab a tray to hold your food. Once you have all of your food, go pay at the counter before finding a seat. The seating is cafeteria-styled, and this place can be extremely packed with a line out the door so do not be shy about sitting next to strangers. I ordered an al pastor taco, tripe taco, and a half order of carne asada fries. The meats are so flavorful and tasty. The al pastor was slightly crispy. The tripe was tender. The carne asada had a nice and subtle char, and the half order of fries was so filling. Overall, it was a perfect meal. These are not dollar street tacos, but the prices are still pretty cheap. The tacos are over $2 each, and the half order of fries was $7.50. Tacos El Gordo make for a tasty, memorable, and inexpensive meal in Vegas. It is not in the heart of the strip, but it worth the trek to the north part of the strip.",

Just in just before lunch time but there was a good amount of crowd. I can tell this place probably gets crazy crowded during the peek lunch time so be aware!   As far as tacos go, you can't go wrong with their al pastor! & of course they have other selection of tacos such as asada, lengua, tripas, suadero etc. They have great selection of fries and quesadillas if you aren't feeling tacos. I crave this place at least once a week so I'm so happy I found this place. A solid 5 stars for friendly service, clean restaurant and amazing tacos!  They're open till 4am?! Can't be mad at that",

Boy was I wrong! Waited 2 hours to get my food. 1 hour and 15 minutes outside in the 110 degree heat and then inside another 45 minutes. Got in the shortest line inside and ended having the longest wait. The people in front of me ordered enough food for 30-40 people each.   The asada tacos were chewy and full of gristle, the spicy pork tacos were really fatty and rubbery but had a good green sauce on top. They make the tortillas fresh on the spot which was a plus.  The flan tasted pretty old even though the expiration date wasn't for a few more days. The horchata came out of a soda fountain machine and overly sweet and not creamy.  I honestly don't get all of the hype of this place? They aren't as good as the tacos here in Utah and we aren't known for the best Mexican food in the west coast. Definitely not as good as the taco's in Cancun or Tijuana.   Will not go back to this place, that 2 hour long wait was a killer and I will be holding a grudge for a while to come.",

I felt like we needed at least three people to eat all we wanted.  So, first decide what you want from the menu.  Then determine which lines offer you those items.  Wait in line.  Get your food and go to the cashier by the entrance.  Find a spot and eat.  Ok, simple enough, it sound like, right?  Wrong!  The place was already packed at around 4PM on a Sunday and each line took forever because each person was getting like 10 tacos.  And forget it if you happen to wait in a wrong line.  By the time you realize it, you'll not want to wait again in the correct line.      The food was great, but I don't know if I'd want to experience the the mayhem again.  Well...we'll see.",

    "text": "I'd saved this place for years now.  We drove by here once and saw the crazy line and didn't go in.   Finally our friends who came in town last week, suggested this place for the second time to go eat here, we agreed to go.  We went around 9:30 PM.  The line wasn't so bad.  The lines started inside of the place.  All the tables were taken at the time we were waiting in line.  By the time we got to order our food, the line did start to go outside.  It took about 30 minutes to order the food.  It's a hole in the wall place.  Super confusing what's going on with the lines for first timer, that doesn't know taco lingo.  I'm surprised there aren't more reviews explaining how the process works.  There are 5 different lines for different type of meat.  Going from left to right.  Line 1 is for Adobada(Spiced pork), Al Pasto(Marinated Pork).  Line 2 and 3 is for Asada(Grilled Steak), Mulas(Any type of meat with two corn tortillas - kinda like quesadillas), Sopes(Handmade thick tortilla), Chorizo(Mexican Sausage).  Line 4 is Adobada(Spiced pork), Al Pasto(Marinated Pork).  Line 5 (All the way to the right) is Cabeza(Braised pulled beef's head), Buche(Fried Pork Stomach), Sesos(Beef Brains), Tripa(Fried Beef Stomach), Suadero(Brisket), Lengua(Beef Tongue).  You wait in the line you want to order that type of tacos.  If you want to try different types of meat, you'll have to wait in line all the lines.  Best if you go with 2 friends and everyone picks a different line and orders for everyone.  This way it would be much faster.  I'm not sure how they can account for all the tacos that goes out this way, because I saw people eating their tacos while they're waiting in a different line.  You basically, wait in line order your tacos.  Pick it up right there, go pay at the cashier.  It's just a little hectic because there are so many people standing in the line or just around that aren't so clear if they're cutting or joining their friends after they ordered food from a different line.    I think it's best if you order at the cashier first, have your receipt to get in line to pick up your food.  It can still be in the different lines.  It would be clearer of what you want instead of yelling over the counter and people eating their food in line and not paying for the food.  The receipt can be printed a little larger with the itemized and one staff walks around to check off after you picked it up your food.  We tried the Adobada, Al Pasto, Asada Tacos and Asada Fries.  I was a fan of the Asada Tacos.  My husband liked all of them and Asada the best.  I think we'll just stick to the Asada line next time. Maybe checkout the 5th line on the side.  We didn't see it until we sat down.  The 5th line was the shortest when we went, I think other newbs like us didn't know like us.    Also, I thought it was funny when one of the cashier came over and was yelling at people standing in line in Spanish about something.  I understood hand gesture of there are 2 lines, but anything else she said....not a clue.  More than half of us doesn't understand Spanish, maybe in English would help too. LOL",

I came here with a group of seven around midnight on a Saturday. I grabbed a table outside and chatted with the security guard by the door. My friends proceeded to go in and wait in the 40 minute line which had been out the door since we arrived.   40 minutes later and a lot of dead bugs on the table in front of me from the fluorescent bulbs above, the food was served hot and ready. Just from tasting their salsa selection was fresh and delicious, giving its own spice to the flavor. I got two tacos for a decent price and carne asada fries. Overall the food was incredible!   There are a lot of make believe Mexican food joints scattered through our Vegas however this one represents and is delicious. The food was great with their own spices and peppers to the mix, truly a traditional Mexican style of cooking.   Sadly I dock one star for the ridiculousness of the wait and one for the cleanliness of the lobby and outdoor seating. Good place to visit, not so much to stop.",

The restaurant divides up the line by the type of meat you want to order.  I like how they arranged that since the system works.  My favorite tacos are the Al Pastor and Carne Asada.  The Al Pastor is the best here and it is a little spicy.  The meats are super flavorful and you just want to keep eating it!  My friends said the Lengua (tongue) is good here too, but I'm not a fan of exotic meat.  There's a side bar that you can grab radish, carrots and different types of salsa.  During busy hours, the line does get long, but it's totally worth the wait for tacos!",

I would call this a hidden gem (only because you don't know about it), but with the amount of reviews and the amount of people at any given time it's pretty well known. Don't be discouraged by the pictures of long lines, they turn out everything quick.   They have separate lines for different cuts of meat, so you might want to have someone else in your group stand in another line to get it all at the same time.   I would highly suggest Pastor (pork) and Asada (beef). You can chose from Flour or Corn tortillas. Don't forget to ask for everything on it! Also the Asada fries are amazing. You can even get a half order and any type of meat you want on top of the fries.",

Pretty chaotic and confusing if you've never been before.   I myself am not a big meat eater so I ordered a cheese quesadilla. Was going to get a chicken taco but they don't have chicken. Anyways the quesadilla  was small, nothing like I expected and the cheese was pretty burnt. I also ordered a horchata and was sad to find out it came out of a fountain drink machine.  I guess for a cheap meal this place was ok but it is nothing I would come back for.",

I also tried the sopes w/carne asada, cheese but it didn't had any beans. The cranes asada was better, but a bit on the salty side.

    "text": "I grew up and live in Los Angeles, where there are taquerias on every street and taquizas at some house party every weekend. I love tacos so much I drive to TJ and Rosarito to eat specific tacos.   Here's how I see it:  If you're from a place where Mexican food and tacos are not common, and if you don't regularly eat tacos (it's a treat or something new), you will be between \"LIKE\" and \"LOVE\".   If you're a TACO LOVER, these tacos will be \"OK\" to \"GOOD\" depending on the meat choice.   I'm a TACO LOVER, tried each taco at each stand outside of Estadio Azteca (on a Clasico day!) to see which one I liked most.  This is just my opinion, ultimately you should try the place and see how you like it.   STAND-OUTS (to me): Suadero Tacos - These were the best tacos here, freaking DELICIOUS. I wish I had gotten them all suadero after trying each taco.   Adobada tacos were also tasty.  CONS: SUPER LONG LINES AND WAIT.   If there's a line outside to get in, wait til you see inside.  They have separate lines for different meats, so the asada and adobada lines were long.   The salsa situation: make sure you ask for as much as you really want and hope they give it to you, because you'll have to wait in line to get more.  It was my 1st time there and I didn't realize that you get your tacos and are supposed to pay at a register tucked in the corner. I jumped on an open table inside and actually ate first, paid when I was done.   To me the tacos were good to satisfy the craving, but some people hype this place up as the best. They're good, but honestly, I don't think I'd wait that long again for those tacos. I'd have to have the craving in Vegas or be tagging along w people that want them.",

I wish I had just gotten the tacos or a burrito instead and skipped the fries.  I also had a carne asada taco that was just perfect. Overall, the food is really, really good. It can get a little hectic when it is busy, but not overly so, I don't think and I think the separate lines, besides being a necessity for the different items, also speed the process. The check out process could be a little more efficient as far as getting from the food lines to the check out, but they have two cash registers, so that is helpful. I am going back tonight because this is one of those places that once you have been, you keep thinking about when you can go back.",

    "text": "Om om om... The only reason I did not give them 5 stars due to price and limited seating. But anyway, back to taco love land.. Amaz.. yes indeed. As you wait in your line of choice (each line has a designated list you can choose from of meats). You can order quesadillas, mullas, tacos, vampiros... with any meat of choice depending on your line of choice. As you wait you will notice fresh corn tortillas are being made and the meat sizzling on the burning grill. As you order you place your order with the man that chops the meat on the block and preps your order to your liking in a matter of seconds. If you ask for the everything you will get cilantro, chopped onions, salsa and guacamole.. mmmhmmm. You place your order on your tray and then walk over to the cashier, who they makes the count and charges your per item. She also is in charge of drinks, and if you want extra salsa (free) you request from her. As you head for the door to eat, don't forget to grab your limes, radishes and salt or pepper. As I mentioned earlier, depending on the time of day, you might not be able to find seating. THis is located in an older center north of the Wynn hotel, right next to some souvenir store. Definitely on my list of stops when in Vegas.",

People, listen, if you want good Mexican street tacos, come to this place.  Had two al pastor tacos and one carne asada.  They were awesome!  A bit on the small side, like mexican street fare, but at two bucks a taco, you can get filled for ten bucks.  Good luck trying to find a deal like that anywhere else on the strip that isn't commercial fast food.  next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm going to grab some asada fries, because these other yelpers keep going on and on about them.",

A delicious marinated steak taco covered with guacamole, salsa, and onions for 2 bucks filled with all the yummy grilled flavor you want from a steak. Or get the lingua taco. The most tender meat you'll get in a taco form. Don't tell your friends what it is (beef tongue) and they won't know the difference! Or get the tripe taco. They must char the meat before they put it on the tortilla because the tender meat had crispy bits of yummy on it. That's my favorite part. I got those three tacos and a water for less than 9 bucks...a huge deal considering I'm eating on the strip!",

In this case, the extra star is for its location. The adobada tacos were pretty awesome. I thought they'd be a little more tender, but the sauce was fantastic and there was a perfect amount of spice. The carne asada tacos were good too, but the adobada were better in my opinion.  And unlimited horchata refills for a little over $1.50? Yes please! I was really looking forward to the grilled green onions, but they looked and tasted more like they were steamed. I know they were grilled though, since I saw them sitting in a pile on the grill. It was just overcrowded so most of the onions didn't get much contact with the grill. I like when they have a little bit of char on them. Overall, it was a great stop right on The Strip.",

The line can be quite slow since everything is made to order.  As soon as you get your order, one pays one grabs a table.  We had 6 between the two of us and a side of the grilled vegetables.  Filled us up!  Spicy pork Pigs head  Lengua (my favorite!!) Steak  Get the grilled vegetables!  Taking one star off since their horchata machine was out of order but they didn't say anything when we ordered and paid.  The pina colada is pretty darn good too!

This was the best one. Spicy flavor is there but not too strong, and meat is so juicy.  - Asada tacos (beef): Pretty good - slightly smokey but still tasty.  - Lengua tacos (tongue): OK, not the biggest fan since it tasted a little too soft/mushy and the sauce was on the weaker side.  Overall... Obviously the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego is the big winner (and original), but Las Vegas has upped its game in terms of taste & quality. Also, you can get the red spicy salsa sauce directly from the guys giving you your tacos (don't bother asking at the cashier's, they're always running out of red sauce there).",

I ate here two days in a row when I was in vegas, once for dinner and then a day later after leaving Surrender nightclub (walking distance, and open late)!   The ordering system is kind of confusing at first since each line is for different meat options, but its easy after your first time. Just split up with your group of friends and have everyone order from a different line for the group.   This is my new must-go restaurant whenever I'm in Vegas.",

So there's 2 establishments right next door to each other, not kidding, and both have lines out the door, so you think 'Wow this is the spot!' WRONG! The line's our the door because it's utter chaos and no direction at all! When you walk in it's like a can of sardines of people. There's like a mass crew of workers behind the counter but pay attention to where you are in line. Each type of taco has its own line and you can't order a pastor taco if you're in the asada line. So you're literally waiting an hour to get your asada taco, then you need to maneuver over to the pastor line , but now you want nachos, so now you gotta wait in that line. By the time you're done getting what you want, your tacos are cold and the homemade tortillas are too hard to eat, but now you have to wait in another line just to pay! F- that!!! Tacos are not good if they're cold! Never coming back to this place. I had to walk out and wait outside because it was too hot and stuffy in there.",

I went to this first when I first got into Vegas and had two Al Pastor tacos and a Tripa Mulita and the tacos were good, but the Mulita was mind-blowing, it was so so so good that I ended up coming back the following day.  The lines are weird and it is confusing when you go into the establishment, especially when its busy but this place is most definitely worth trying.  Service - 4.0 (fast, depending on what is ordered) Food - 5.0 Venue - 5.0 (Average quickserve joint, with a patio )",

Never mind the crazy lines because this place is worth the wait, but every taco I've had here has been A1. The Al Pastor, Carne Asada and Adobada are my three favorites. The meat is all cooked to perfection, and the sauce they put on the tacos just adds to the taste.   Each taco ranges from about $2.25-2.40 depending which taco you get.   The way the lines are set up are separated by which kind of taco you want. So if you're going alone, and want a carne Asada and Al Pastor taco, be prepared to wait in line for al pastor, then in another for carne Asada. That might be the only fault in this place, but at the end of the day it's not the biggest deal as long as the food is good!   I recommend getting everything on your tacos, food allergies permitting, and ask for Pineapple on your al pastor and Abodaba tacos! I tried it for the first time and it was a pleasant surprise! Enjoy!!!   5/5 burritos!",

However, the reason they gave me the asada tacos is because I only got three. Yes, there are different lines for different types of meat so to save time, come here with someone so you can divide and conquer the line. Also, there is another location about a block away and the space is larger. We got the adobada French fries, spicy pork tacos and carne asada tacos. I really enjoyed the carne asada tacos and I did like the spicy pork, but not as much as the carne asada. The abododa fries were great! Giving 4 stars because of the wait, different lines for different meats and the extra charge for salsa.",

I'm not talking about the Americanized tacos like carne asada, but the kind you get at the OG street taco stands. My favorites are the Cabeza (beef head), Tripa (beef tripe), Lengua (beef tongue), and Buche (pork stomach) tacos...which are only offered at the more authentic taco restaurants. Even then, some of them are not good (not as fresh), so finding one that's authentic AND fresh is a real gem!   Tacos el Gordo in Las Vegas is one of my favorite stops for authentic tacos! It's soo good--the best next thing to going to Mexico for tacos. It's so satisfying!   All the meat here is fresh, tasty and juicy! They have a HUGE spit-grilled Al Pastor. I was literally standing there watching the JUICE drip off the spit as meat was being sliced off. *drools* So tender and incredibly tasty! At Tacos el Gordo, you can also get grilled pineapple with your Al Pastor tacos and I absolutely LOVE their green sauce.  So. Freakin. Delicious.!!  This location in Vegas is on the strip so it is busier and the line can look a bit crazy all wrapped around. But the wait is not that long! It's definitely worth the wait.",

Lengua tacos, carne asada tacos, brain tacos - you name it, they've got it.  You come in, and tell the cooks what you want, then bring your food over to the cashier and find an open place to sit. Parking lot is plentiful and free behind the shop. Come hungry.",

    "text": "Why do they not have a location in Los Angeles?!  This is honestly my favorite taco spot in San Diego and in Las Vegas. The fact that they do not have one in Los Angeles makes me sad because I LOVE their Adobada. Located at the end of the Strip past Encore Hotel, it sits on the outside of the plaza it's located in. It is pretty difficult to find parking because most parking spots are reserved for other businesses in the plaza. Now this place is extremely popular in both San Diego and Las Vegas. Typically there is a line at both locations but it isn't a long wait and it is well worth the wait. There isn't enough seating usually but people typically don't sit around after they finish so it isn't a long wait for a seat either.  The way to order is you go up to the station that for the meat you would like to order. There are signs on-top of each station that tells you what type of meat they are serving at that station and you wait in the small queue till it is your turn to order. Once you go up to the station, they will just ask you how many you want and if you would like all toppings on it.   From my recollection, if you decide to go with all the topping it includes their signature green sauce which I think is one of the best sauces in the world, cilantro, red salsa, and onions. The red salsa is mild at best in terms of spice level. I have tried the Carne Asada, the Lengua, and also the Al Pastor. My favorite is the Al Pastor just because no other taqueria makes it like they do. The tortillas are made fresh right next to each and every station. After making the tortillas, they fry them a bit with the oil from the meat. It just adds bit of extra flavor to the taco. For the Al Pastor, they slice the meat off the Adobada and is caught on the tortilla. It is just absolutely beautiful as you watch the meat fall and all the juices sipping through the rest of the pork still spinning on the fire. Then comes the toppings, like I said, their green sauce is liquid gold. I can't pinpoint to what the sauce is exactly but I believe it consists of cilantro, lime, and mayo. It isn't thick and it just brings out a nice refreshing taste to the savory pork. The Carne Asada and Lengua are also delicious but the Al Pastor is the must get at Tacos El Gordo.   If you're in Las Vegas and looking for a cheap eat that's opened late, this is the spot. Their taste is consistent even after years of going and I believe they will continue to do so. Best Taco Spot in Vegas",

I won't go into a long rant..I dislike those types of yelp reviews but if I see the guy that served me again I will go to another line. If you didn't speak Spanish there wasn't much love and it turns out his English perfect. Funny thing I tipped him before my order..I saw he busted his butt with the two other ladies in front of me and they didn't tip but he took care of them! So I thought he deserves it everyone working there does. They work very hard serving that many people all day long.   Oh well it's not a reflection on the business, just the one individual.",

You can also get the grilled peppers on the side for free, which is nice.   I normally stick with asada, lengua, and cabeza tacos, but last time they were out of lengua at 430am. Their Asada fries are pretty delicious as well. The best part about this place is probably the unlimited horchata and orange bang fountain drinks.. So good!   The place gets pretty packed in the wee hours after everyone leaves the club. It's within walking distance of Wynn/encore, so if you go to any of the clubs there, go to gordos after!",

The taste is very authentic, from the hand made tortillas, to the meat, to the fresh salsa and guacamole. If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back.   Only issue is the line / crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while. But there is a PRO TIP here... offer the guy in the alpastor line a nice 3 dollar tip and ask him to order a few asada tacos for you... works every time ! (Of course this only works in spanish... but it works).  besides the huge lines, this place is the best... even after waiting 20 minutes... I still give it five stars, cause there is nothing like it... best place to eat in Vegas : )",

    "text": "Happy Drinko De Mayo, which means \"drink the mayonnaise.\" ? :|  I found myself having dinner out last night and spending this day fox-holed in a bunker because I'm in a town where there's a large... element of celebration whose highlights are at 11:00, our version of L.A. Lite after the Lakers win the Championship.  So, I wasn't able to go to Taco El Gordo, but it certainly was foremost on my mind. I felt like I was cheating on my date by dreaming of the accommodating, doting and comforting restaurant I made hot monkey dinner with weeks ago.   Admittedly, the first time I went PAST?? Gordo was with trepidation. The place where the now legend resides is a place where a couple of businesses ago, I got to go out with the first (of 4, so far) Vegas bartenders I had gone out with. The location tanked after construction halted on Echel-outofluck. (Construction workers also gott busted for drinking during lunch). So businesses got a rep of not lasting long near the intersection.  Nearby, if you can't stay in business selling espresso & cwof-fee in lingerie, that's tough times depression. Even the jewel of Baker, Ca. The Mad Greek couldn't survive at this very location. (They did better at a couple of off strip locations).  But this last time I was near, there were lines OUT the door. And this was not one line but 6 wide in the building. And there wasn't 1 pissed off person in the place, we were all salivating over the smells of the grill like zombies surrounding a chess competition (BRAAIINS).   The tacos looked great, but honestly, I've had those before at other places. When I find a special restaurant, I want the big sampler for variety. There wasn't really one, so I decided to get the largest thing on the menu, the carne asada fries. And normally the few times I eat meat, I get chicken. But since the beef wasn't ground, I got that. As delicious as the spicy pork looked being sliced off the gorgeous hunk of rotating abodada, pork always celebrates a little too much and pisses off my stomach's downstairs neighbors.  And then, AND THEN, as if that weren't enough, I got something to drink and not only found horchataaaaaah, which I love, but also a long lost friend beckoned from the past that I had not seen in decades: ORANGE BANG, the bastard cousin of the Orange Whip, also on the endangered list. Give to World Wildlife Fund generously to save or stun, tag and monitor the mating habits of these beautiful beasts.  So I got carne asada fries. As much as I would love yelp to have a MotherF'er button I know it would get abused, but here it's quite applicable. The benches outside were rightfully packed, so I plopped unceremoniously on the astroturf putting green they had nearby. I positioned myself as to where I could see the most women standing in limos hollering WOOOO as I could see.   There I was sitting, looking at my dinner, actually star struck. I think pictures of food are helpful on yelp, but the actual process of taking pics of your food is odd and strange. Take pics of your food like no one's watching? And yet there I was taking pics, reciting \"this is my carne asada fries. There are many others like it, but this one is mine to devour until I am picking bits of it out of my eyebrows.\"  I took before and aftermath pics of the carnage of disheveled paper and styro goods. I was full 2/3's of the way, so I sat for awhile and then resumed until I finished every rigoddamn delicious fry and bit of veg there was.   There are 4 other mexican food places I love in all of Vegas. But this one had the best first impression of them all! Enjoy it now before a corporation buys them out and homogenizes them!  I didn't feel competent enough to tackle the Campechana, largely because I didn't see anyone else get it, out of all those people? But someday I will get down on that. Someday..",

Hit the uber to Tacos El Gordo.   Price: About $2.25 per taco and $7.50 for half order of carne asada fries  Food:  These are the best tacos you can find in Vegas. Hands down. And for the price, you can't go wrong. I prefer the carne asada tacos, but the line is way too long. Definitely get the carne asada fries!   Drinks:  Basic bottled drinks in the shop, but check out the boba shop next door and get yourself some boozy boba or boozy mangonada... OF NOTE: you cannot bring alcohol into tacos el gordo because they do not have a liquor license.  Service: Fast food and SLOW but worth it. Be prepared to not only wait in the line that goes out the door, but also all the lines inside... PRO TIP: carne asada line is the longest. I would just settle for the Al Pastor if you don't mind delicious pork and pineapple. Also, you can order fries in any line!  We'll be back!",

First thing to note is that there are separate lines for the type of meat you want on your tacos. So if you want a certain type of meat, have your friends be in different lines if you want to try all of them. Once you get your food, just go to the cash register and pay. I ended up getting Al Pastor, and man was it worth the wait even in the cold. The tacos packed the right amount of heat level and honestly I have no complaints. They have their sides for free on a separate counter if you need limes or radishes. I see why there is hype for this place. You have to try the orange bang here too! It's like an orange cream juice.",

I expected so much more when I saw the line out the door. As we started getting close to the door we noticed multiple lines inside. There are 4 or 5 lines and each line is for  1 or 2 kinds of meats. So if you want some asada tacos you have to then line up in one line and if you want al pastor tacos you go to another line and there are still 3 more lines!!! By the time I went into the second line my tacos had gotten cold already. The system they have completely sucks then you have to go to another line to pay with the plates of food you have. My experience would have been better if it was just like any other ordinary restaurant, you order you pay then get your food HOT! Definitely not worth going again",

I came in on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door!  Once you walk in, there are multiple lines depending on what kind of meat you want. I veered to the left and just got 3 Al Pastor tacos. I could have done 1 more to be honest. They aren't that big.   After you get your plate,you go find a cashier to pay or get in another line to get a different kind of taco.  Holy crap, I don't know if I was starving or what not, but these tacos were amazing! It was flavorful and the meat was so moist! Food can be expensive in Las Vegas so if you are looking for a tasty cheap meal, I would definitely go here!   PS. they do have outdoor seating but there is no mist or A/C. There are cover umbrellas though. The restaurant faces the sun in the afternoon so it can definitely get hot.

Carne Asada quesadilla - PACKED with steak on a soft thick tortilla with lots cheese, pico and guacamole.  2. Buche tacos - pork stomach that has been simmered for HOURS until tender and highly seasoned.   3. Spicy pork taco - cut right off the spit fresh for you.They also add grilled pineapple at your request. Excellent  4. Tongue taco - seasoned and tender.   I personally think these are BETTER than most of the tacos I had in Tijuana. But the sign here says they are from Tijuana so I must have missed them. Hard to remember anything in Tijuana actually. I could have ate here and just forgot from all the tequila I drank while I was there. Who knows?!  This place is open TWENTY FOUR HOURS!!!",

Slightly spicy marinated pork with all the goodies!    You'll never want to eat carne asada again lol",

That's exactly how I stumbled upon this taco shop, just like probably 75% of everyone else that come here too LOL. Tacos el Gordo is a classic, and it's well known not only in Vegas but all over Southern California and Tijuana. I've been to the location in San Diego and I wanted to give this place a try as well. Considering the fact that it was 3am, the line was fairly long. I waiting about 30 min for my food. Definitely try the adobada tacos here, and ask for the pineapple!! I don't know if it was because I was buzzed or if the tacos were really that good, or probably both... But the tacos here were great!! I got some snobby attitude by the ladies at the cashier but tbh I didn't care too much lol. Definitely stop by Tacos el Gordo for some cheap food to grub on if you're in the area!!",

For two people, this is usually plenty because they fill up the half togo box full of fries and they give you a good amount of meat. And what makes it better? THE CREAMY GREEN SAUCE! The fries are crunchy and they come right out of the fryer.  I'm going to keep coming back until this place either disappears or stops making good food (hopefully that never happens) =]",

Enduring the phenomenal smell was pure torture while waiting to have your order taken and made, but once it was your turn, you felt like you were the only person that mattered.

    "text": "This a good place to have a small after hours drinking meal. The location is pretty convenient on the strip. When you get in, there are multiple lines depending on what type of meat you want to order. The lines get long especially at night. The best part about this place is the fresh tortilla. You see the cook prepare them right in front you. The tortilla feels fresh and warm. It isn't thick so you don't feel overloaded with carbs. The combination of meat and tortilla is pretty well done. As for the meat, I feel the best meat is the pork. It was splendid, flavorful, juicy and totally fatty. This is a perfect item when you have been drinking for hours. Unfortunately, I can't say this about the asada and chorizo. The asada was very disappointing. It was flavorless and slightly dry. The chorizo was somewhat better than the asada but similarly it is also dry. Another weird thing in my opinion is that depending on what type of meat you want to order you might have to get back in another line since each line has a different type of meat. Now the price is kind of expensive for the amount of food you get. Each taco is around $2.25 and it is not worth $2.25. I say at max this should be around $1.75. Overall, I would say come back when you want some good street tacos at night but don't bother during the day because for the price you are kind of getting ripped off.",

Might as well just save your time going to another Mexican spot. Must order adobada fries (small size is just enough for two).

    "text": "Despite having been to Vegas at least 100 times, I never made my way to Tacos El Gordo until just recently. It's located in a strip mall about a 5 minute walk past Encore on the strip. The tacos are $2.00 and the carne asada fries are $10.00. Portions are pretty good - don't expect anything too fancy. There's limited seating inside but plenty of tables outside. The way it works is you go to the corresponding booth for what you want to order, put it all on a tray, and then pay after. Food is pretty good but I had a terrible experience.  One downside to this place is that it may or may not have gotten me food poisoning. Considering there's close to 1000 reviews on this place, I may have just been an oddball but I was in a sweaty, chilly pain a few hours after eating here praying all night long to the porcelain god in the hotel and vomiting 16x. Since this was the first thing I had in Vegas, I subsequently didn't get to indulge myself in any other food or alcohol for the remainder of the trip.   You've been warned.",

People could sit down, eat and leave by the time you get your food and pay for it.   Another tip, you can order any tacos from any of the counters, not the the one listed. Seems that was confusing for people as they were jumping from window to window.   The tacos here are crazy delicious and the lines of faithful lined up to get at them shows that. Ultimate drunk food snack. My favorite is probably Tripes as it has a crispy texture, but you really can't go wrong with any of them. Sesos or Brain I am a bit wary of so I can't speak to the quality of that but I'm sure its good if that's your thing.   Everytime I'm in Vegas I need me these tacos.",

As an Angelino (someone from LA), there are taco places everywhere- perhaps there are as many taco joints as there are gas stations lol. Having said that, I've tried the most reviewed, highest rating, and even mediocre taco joints. However, my mouth has never met such an amazing taco. When I say these are the best tacos I've had in my life, I seriously mean it.   The lines are ridiculously long, and that's the only slight complaint I have....but being that it's a hit, it's expected.   Make sure you order the al pastor with a slice of pineapple. Also order a side of nopales (grilled cactus) and don't forget the salsa and Coca Cola.   To whoever wrote a bad review about this place- go back to Taco Bell.",

    "text": "This is my first review and unfortunately it's negative, but very True. Service here is really bad. Avoid going here at all cost to save yourself from inconveniences. Here's what happened to us. (8 people total)  After a fun night in Vegas, we decided  to get some tacos. When we entered the place, we noticed there were different lines for the different types of meats. Meaning, you can only buy tacos of adobada/pastor OR asada, not both unless you and your friends divide into the different lines. The waiting time was about an hour. It's a struggle to find a table.  The cashier is separate from the ordering area. They make you get into a different line to pay while you hold your food. This can cause your tacos to get cold. One of my friends decided to place the tacos on the table and then went to get in line to pay. He was told that he needed to show them the tacos and couldn't pay causing him to go back and getring in line all over again.   Then, we were eating and one of the ladies that cleans the tables, came behind me, to tell me that my asada mulita and asada tacos were not paid by my friend. My other friend jumped in and said she paid for them and asked if they wanted to see the receipt. The rude lady took the receipt not believing us and consulted with cashier to make sure it was legit. This was offensive, later the lady came to return the receipt and didn't apologize for her mistake. We will never come back to this place.  This place is loosing business/ customers, I find it ridiculous that if you go by yourself you can be limited to one meat only.",

I almost cried the 2nd time I tried to go around 3 a.m. and it was closed. It said it was still open on the door but they weren't letting anyone in anymore.   YOU HAVE TO GET THE ADOBADA!! There's a reason why I wrote it in all caps. It's that good. Seriously you won't regret it. I swear on my life. It's flavorful and super tender and juicy. That's why all the people are lined up to get the Adobada.   Tip, the long line is just for the adobada. If you are ordering something else you don't have to wait in that line.",

This is THE place to go if you want yummy and downright authentic Mexican food because wooooooo, your tastebuds will thank you in the process whether you're just trying to conquer your hunger, cravings, or just the drunchies ('cause after all, Viva Las Vegas!).   Lines can get long. Place can get pretty packed - dependent on when you visit, but the lines move relatively fast (and tbh, if you're not fully there sometimes life can move by so quickly if you're lucky haha)!  Now personal preference time! I love getting lengua (beef tongue) with all the fixins! If you're about that lengua life, look no further. Tacos El Gordo will hook you up with the noms, but even if you're not and you want carne asada or their other proteins, do you and you won't regret it. & If you have more dolla dolla bills to spare, get yourself an horchata. Go ahead treat yourself! Just don't be like me and get super excited in a drunken stupor and get horchata on your phone.....  Overall? I dig you, Tacos El Gordo. You're the answer to my taco prayers and even though I never got to pay your San Diego location a visit (which some say is incomparable and that SD is better....but that's all personal preference) I know I'd probably love that location as well.

(Note: Green onions and peppers are served through the tortas line only)  Line was up to the door but not past the door, which translated to about a 30 minute wait for the adobada and a 40 minute wait for my other tacos. After getting the food, there is then yet ANOTHER line to pay, which is annoying because it's by the door that keeps getting opened and blows cool air over your food (at least in winter) and therefore renders your food cool by the time you pay and eat.   Parking lot just outside and had no trouble with parking at 11am on a public holiday Monday.   I ordered adobada, cabeza, and lengua tacos, and a tripa vampiro. The vampiro is two crispy tortillas with cheese, so the whole thing is comparable to the size of two tacos. Personally, I prefer straight up tacos because I'm not as big of a fan of crispy shells and didn't think the cheese added much flavor. Much purer appreciation of meat from the tacos.  Won't repeat what others have already emphasized about the food - it's delicious and authentic. Highly recommend, but also recommend that you go when they open to avoid lines. Ignore any review that tries to compare it to Taco Bell because they obviously have no idea what they are talking about.   And FWIW, my group may well have been the only non-Spanish speaking group there that morning. Rare in a place like Vegas and speaks to the quality of the food here. GO.",

I've frequented Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, but since I've moved back to the East Coast, I wasn't keeping up with the chain's expansion so I was ecstatic to find run into one in Vegas!  I stuck with my favorite, lengua (tongue) for $2.25 each and devoured it. 3 tacos is probably more than enough. The food is super fresh and the service is quick and there's plentiful seating so you can be in and out. They also have Mexican drinks such as horchata (!!!) readily available to be dispensed.  I'm definitely coming back again when I'm in Vegas!",

    "text": "Oh geez, where do I start.  I've heard so much hype about the tacos here and I was excited to finally make it to the Las Vegas Blvd. location to get some to go.  There was no parking so my bf dropped me off while he circled the parking lot.  As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed. It was like a crazy zoo with people just everywhere. It was hard to tell where to order as there were 6-8 lines.  I grabbed a tray and jumped into one of these lines. I was maybe the 15th person back so it was a bit of a wait.  When I finally got up to the window, the guy serving informed me that the meat I wanted, asada, was not available in that line and I needed to go to another line.  Actually, he kind of yelled all of this at me in Spanish and after going back and forth for a few minutes I finally understood his irritated frantic pointing to the signs taped to the glass in front of him.  Frustrated and defeated, I slowly made my way all to the way to the back of another line and waited and waited 15 more minutes.  Finally I got up to the front of the line and it was smooth sailing from here.  I ordered 3 asada, 3 chorizo, and 3 adobada.  Once I got the food, I didn't know what to do since they were on a plate on my tray and I needed them to go.  I must have looked like a lost puppy because one of the workers cleaning up the soda machine asked me if I needed help and with huge relief I said yes, I needed these to go.  So he directed me to the cashier and said she'd put them in a to go back for me after I paid.  Done and done! I got back in the car and we immediately started going to town on these bad boys. I must say, they were amazing and worth every frustrated minute of waiting in line.   Can't wait to go back and do it all over again, except this time, I know what line to get into!!",

We got the al pastor, carne asada, and the abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. My favorite was the abodaba (spicy pork). The meat is so juicy and flavorful. I can easily polish off 4 tacos. The carne asada fries are also good. They really pack on the meat and cheese, but wished they put on more guacamole. The fries are good, but I think I'd much rather eat more abodaba tacos! I also got the Horchata, it was OK. It was too watered down, I've had better. Parking isnt bad, saying how busy it is. We parked in a lot thats facing the Wynn, and there was plenty of parking... Easy access to good late night Mexican food!",

I didn't mind waiting in line at all because the line was just up to the door, but the biggest problem was... the line wasn't moving for at least 15-20 minutes. I was standing in the same spot for the longest time and it didn't look like anyone's order was coming up. Usually, they can get people their food pretty quickly but not this night. Some people were complaining because each line was for different kinds of meat and so groups had to split up into the different lines so they could get carne asada, adobada, etc. and waste time going on every line. There needs to be a better system for that because if someone is by themselves on busy nights and they want different kinds of tacos, are they supposed to wait in every single line and let their food get cold?    I still enjoy the food here and will most likely come back but this is what I experienced recently the other night.",

We were excited to hear that they were back open this time.  I was in LV, celebrating my 30th Bday with about 25 of my friends and family from around the US. Saturday night 12/12 we left the hotel to hit Tacos El Gordo, There were about 8-10 of us. We ordered our food, paid and continued to seat ourselves. Mid bite, we were approached by the police. Scared and slightly intimidated, he asked us to show our receipts. He said that the Cashier told him that we did not pay for our food. We showed all of our receipts and the officer was apologetic. No one else in the restaurant that night was asked to show their receipt. Why were we targeted? My friends and I are all professional women with careers and families at home and of course were very capable of covering 2 dollar tacos. I'm most disgusted in the attitudes and beliefs displayed by TEG staff this night. We were never issued an apology or anything. We were were racially profiled and it was humiliating, embarassing and disgusting.",

I understand the gentlemen taking the orders because they have to cook the meat and serve the order, but the Cashier Ladies were very impolite and really need to take a class to educate themselves to deal with large crowds and take better handle of their restaurant.

Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana taco joint that is also now in the U.S. They have locations in San Diego, Vegas and Temecula. Having tried the real deal in TJ, I was skeptical that the Vegas one would not be as good. But it is just as good. When you first walk in its a little hectic and confusing. They have separate lines for different meats.  All the tacos are good but their best is the Al Pastor or Adobada. It's a  thinly sliced marinated pork on a rotating spit. Make sure to order plenty of tacos and ask for the green salsa and cebollitas (onions) and chiles.  I also highly recommend the Adobada quesadilla and Adobada fries which is French fries with a ton of Adobada meat. This place is heaven for any taco loving glutton. I've had tacos all over Mexico and can honestly say these are the best tacos you will find in the United States. I was trying to keep this place a secret but judging from the lines there and number of reviews the secret is out. The Vegas location is full of tourists so it's key to go there at the right time which is early for lunch or early evening for dinner. During the 2am drunken hour this place is a zoo.",

It's in the strip mall on a corner just north of Encore/Wynn.  But do *not* try to walk here, even from those hotels.  Too much on a typical Vegas weather day, and the traffic signal at that T-intersection is a joke.  NOT pedestrian friendly.  Yes, es stupido mucho.  Si, laugh at my decisione no bueno.  Staggering in, barely avoiding heat stroke... well at least the soft drink machine was working.  What timing.  One of the ice dispensers was broken.  Still, the soda was fine, and the food was relatively worth the scorching trek.  There are only two sizes for Carne Asada fries:  large and massively large.  Either one is more than enough for a couple of average appetites.  Tacos are on the small side, but they're filling and full of great flavour.  The tortillas are doused in oil, quite heavy.  Watching the guy use a machete, slicing at the rotating hulk of Adobado pork, is kind of fun.  It's also rather sweet seeing families having a meal at Tacos El Gordo, little boys play-fighting their brothers.  Speaking Spanish (which I don't ;/ waah ) is an advantage.  They seem to hook you up with extra good stuff, if you can hold a convo with them.  Not much else to say, except... Tacos El Gordo = excellente!",

I usually get mines with no avocado, since most of the time they usually put a spoonful of avocado & i really dont need to taste that much avocado in one sitting.  Not only do i order the carne asada tacos, but also the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries can either come in half ($5) or a large order ($10). I ordered the half ordered and OHHH GEEZ it was pretty BIG! I couldnt even finish it, it was good but not THAT good.   Needless to say, I could always come back to this taco eatery. Yumm yumm",

There were lines everywhere.  We stood in one of the lines for about 10 minutes.  The lines were going nowhere.  In fact, some of the lines were getting backed up because folks were letting others cut in front of them.  Very uncool!!  They should have a system in place to bring order to the madness whenever the place gets so freakin crowded!!  I enjoyed watching the disorganization for awhile, but after 10 minutes I had enough.  So we joined other people and simply left.  Would return based on their impressive Yelp rating and number of reviews.  I will just wait for a time when they are less chaotic.

The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole which is always a plus for me.   After ordering and receiving your food you go to the cashier to pay.

They both had lines,  but after talking to a friend of mine who is a Las Vegas native he told me peppermill was overrated.    So me and a friend stood in line that took an hour to get to the front.   I will say this,   Know what you want while in line.  If you have someone with you stand in separate lines as they split up into different lines depending on what you want.   I got the asada tacos on flour tortilla and my friend got the al pastor tacos on corn tortilla.   Both were delicious and some of the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.

Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.  Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).  Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.  Buen apetito!",

Had 10 pastor tacos and 2 pastor quesadillas.  Amazing, simple filling and typically taco stand, taco truck, taqueria like atmosphere.  Love tacos, but would not wait more than 15 mins for this, too many other options.  But if the timing works out, there is a no brainer.   I wish they had one back home that was open late.",

So I was really looking forward to Tacos El Gordo. The lines were kind of discouraging but moved fairly quickly. You have to wait in different lines for different types of tacos.  We got the beef (I forget which one, there are several), the tongue and spicy pork. They were all frickin' broke da mout!  It is a weird system though. You stand in line for your tacos and then take your order up to the register to pay, then find a seat and eat. With so many people in the restaurant, I'm just wondering how they prevent people from skipping the payment part and just sitting to nosh as soon as they get their tacos. Honor system I guess.  Well worth the waits as these are some seriously good tacos.",

Super busy and its too small in the restaurant where you need to order. There were 3 different lines when you enter. The first line to the left will be the line where you order asada or anything beef. The 2nd line next to that is where you would order the al pastor or adobada, and the 3rd line to the far right is where you can order asada fries.   We ordered asada tacos and my cousin ordered the al pastor and lengua. The asada tacos were soo good and the toppings that they put really just top it off. The al pastor was a little too spicy for me but still good at the same time. Price is not bad either. Most the tacos are no more that $2.50. Cant beat that deal. Especially when you're looking for something cheap and easy.",

    "text": "Came here by recommendation. Over-rated!!!  Came  here to eat tacos before heading back home to AZ. There was a long line for starters so took roughly 40  min to get the food and start eating. The MAJOR down side to this place is once u get inside the building(because the line does stretch to the outside), there are about 6 lines inside for each type if meat u want to eat. So if u want tacos de Asada and carnitas, there are 2 separate lines for that, not to mention, once u get ur food on one line, you'll have to wait approx another 10 min Or so to get ur other tacos from the other line. Then, there is another line to pay once u get ur food. The food by this time is already getting cold so you won't enjoy eating it fresh and also not to mention good luck finding somewhere to sit and eat. Best practice would be to come with several people obviously so they can all get in different lines and get your order from them. Overall, the Asada taco was a bit dry, but the Al Pastor was great. I won't be coming back to this place because it is not worth the long waiting especially if you want to get different kinds of tacos from different lines major major downside to this place.",

I know there are lots of fancy tacos and unlimited combinations by my favorite is a carne asada taco with guacamole, lime, a little hot sauce on a handmade tortilla. I am very picky when it comes to tacos, I grew up in Mexico and I had tacos at least 3 times a week.  Tacos El Gordo has some of the best tacos I've had here in the states. First off, their meat is fresh, some places use cheap meat and they try to mask it with good salsa. I get my tacos with salsa on the side, drenched meat is not appealing to my taste buds. I went to Tacos El Gordo and I tried a vampiro which is a toasted tortilla with melted cheese and carne asada on top. Similar to a quesadilla but the tortilla is toasted instead. I also got a carne asada taco and hubby got lengua (beef tacos) the meat was tender, the salsa was spot on and the place was clean. The reason I gave it one star is because people have to make line according to the type of taco they want, so if I want three diff kinds of meat I have to make line 3 times. I'm lazy so I only make one time, hubby made line for another kind. It was really good, next time I will try the al pastor one.",

It was highly amusing (for me) to see people getting all crazy and in fights over waiting for tables and just being aggro over the loooong waits.  Yes, it's crazy-mad mayhem, dirty, & a pain in the ass to get a table... but it's a meal/experience you won't forget!  Definitely go in with more than 1 person, because you have to wait in separate lines for different menu items!  You HAVE to order the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos! They were the best thing we ate~ we tried all the different tacos and the Carne Asada fries. I don't know if it's cuz we were staving or if it's really that good,  but we all agreed that the food was awesome (2 friends with us that night we from Mexico, & they confirmed that those Adobada tacos were BOMB!!!)!

So i dunno if this location is a bit bigger... but definitely a bonus that the tables & chairs move unlike the Charleston location where the booths are bolted down ahahahaha  The staff is just as quick & efficient i would have to say when it comes down to getting the tables cleaned & showing up out of nowhere w/ foil to wrap up my leftovers! =]  I thought that the food would be the same as the Charleston location... but it was different =[  I will unfortunately have to say it was not as good as the Charleston location.  1/2 AL PASTOR FRIES $6.00 - I wouldn't say i would order this again.... but it wasn't bad to try. I thought it was a bit dry... just not enough of everything for each bite of fries.  FLOUR MULA AL PASTOR $4.25 - this is my go-to when i eat at tacos el gordo, but i was bit disappointed w/ the flour tortilla because it wasn't as GREASY as i would typically expect it to be... me & the hubby assume maybe the flat-top needs a little more \"dirtiness\" breaking into.   AL PASTOR TACO $2.10 - ALL-in-ALL i think the Al PASTOR needs a little more seasoning to it in general.

This place is amazing and super affordable. If you want to eat here try to go during the day because the line is ridiculous at night once people start going out and partying.   Once you enter the restaurant there are different lines to form depending on the type of meats you want and if you want to order fries. It's a little confusing but looks for the signs above the cook stations windows that list the types of things you can order. Once you order go to one of the cashiers and pay. When your food is ready the cooks will yell out your order.",

I grew up eating Mexican food (I was the token Asian in my neighborhood), so I spent many days eating all the good stuff from my friends' abuelitas.  Menudo, pozole, chilequilas - I might as well consider myself half Mexican!  I had to yelp a Mexican food place in Vegas, and this one was the first to pop up.  It's just past the main strip in between Caesar's Palace and Circus Circus, and the place reeks of Taqueria (in a good way).  It's not dirty, and the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful.  Btw, no burritos here.  Tacos are mostly two dollars each and you can try the standard meats like carne asada and chicken or you could get down to the nitty gritty and go for the lengua (tongue), suadero (fatty pork shoulder), and cabeza (brain).  What's also beautifully prepared is their spicy pork on a spit.  The process ensures a tasty crisp meat contrasting the tenderness of the pork.  Everything (with the exception of the tortillas) is prepared fresh.  Tons of cilantro, diced onions, and salsa verde (or salsa roja) top off the tacos, and, man are they delicious.  My brothers were looking forward to the buffets of Las Vegas, but when I took them here on our first night, the kept suggesting we come back here.  Great food.",

However, customer services SUCKS! I wanted salsa and the taco people sent me to the cashier, then the cashier sent me to the taco people again. Waste of time.

When I was ordering the second round, I realized the corn tortilla was fresh made right there. That's why the taco was so good.  Anybody appreciates authentic Mexican food, you have to go there and give it a try.  I gave 4 stars for the high price and not so good service(bad attitudes). The taco is quite small for $2 each, I had to eat 7 to get full.",

The adobada sopes are superbly delicious! The spices and sauces they use for their meat are different from every other Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to. It's pure deliciousness in each bite! Also, eating here won't hurt your wallet at all!  That all being said, there is one thing I can't stand about Tacos El Gordo...and that's that there isn't one in Phoenix!! I woud be the first to jump on that ship if it ever set sail!   Go eat here, people!!!  To quote Tracy Jordan from 30 Rock...  I want to take Tacos El Gordo behind the middle school and get it pregnant.",

I came here every time I walked by. For 2$ a taco, you just cant beat the taste and freshness of \"The Fat Taco\". I just wish that I could find a similar restaurant near my house.....I live in San Diego, I know they exist. The only bummer about El Gordo is how far on the end of the strip it sits. It's almost directly across the street from Circus Circus, you know, the ghetto part of the strip. I've grown up about 45 minutes away from Mexico my entire life and only here did I see all of the nitty gritty taco ingredients. Cabeza, Lengua, Cheek, etc. But by far the best on their menu is the Adobada. Do yourself a favor and come get a damn good taco!",

I had much better chorizo from the TJ location for sure. $2 for tacos, $4 for mulitas and quesadillas and $10 for carne asada fries that feed an army of 5 or  a few very drunk people.

There was a long line outside the door around lunchtime on a weekday so we ended waiting about 20 or 30 minutes. As you get closer to the front, it just gets more chaotic. It's not a big space and there's people everywhere. The confusing part is that there's different ordering lines for different meats. If you want a lot of different things, it's probably best to come with a group of people so you don't have to stand in multiple lines yourself. The best part is that the tortillas and meat are made right in front of you! Then you take your tacos to yet another line to pay. I wish their lining system was different since it was confusing but the food was so worth it. Also don't forget to go to their confinement's bar where you can get limes and radishes! The meat was so flavorful and delicious. Get the al plastor tacos! With the cheap prices, you won't be disappointed.",

Being from San Diego i am used to good street tacos and Mexican food so when i saw they had some locations down in San Diego i was happy to check it out. The line was out the door both times i went, but they are worth the wait! When you walk in they have different lines depending upon what type of meat you want to order.   They have Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, Adobada, Suadero, Cabeza, and Lengua. They offer tacos, fries, tortas, and tostadas. It took a while to figure out what i wanted to get, but i ended up going with the fries. I got the al pastor fries and they were topped with cheese, salsa, a guacamole creme sauce and onions and cilantro. You can get the fries in either a regular or large size. The first time i came i got the regular size and it was do dang good i cam back and got the large size! Both times i went the fries were just so tasty and the salsa wasn't spicy and added a very good flavor to it!   The best part is there is a liquor store next door so you can get some food and go grab some beer or something to drink and head back to your hotel room to enjoy in peace! Awesome place to go and extremely affordable compared to other places around!",

    "text": "Everyone wants to know, is it worth it? That's the big question here. You see that long line up and you're thinking, do I want to stand in that just for some tacos? Well, ask yourself a few questions. Do you have to be somewhere? Do you mind standing in whatever weather it is at that moment? Do you have patience? Are you drunk, hungry, and just don't care but wanting to get down on some greasy yet yummy food? Do you come from a place that has plenty of mean street tacos available?  I've come to known Tacos El Gordo from their San Diego, Cali locations. From Tijuana, Mexico, to California, and now Nevada. These guys are definitely making a name for themselves across the border. We rolled up on a Friday evening, probably around 7:30-8pm. That was our mistake. It's as if we were waiting in line for the new roller coaster at an amusement park. My buddy who went to the store next door around 6pm said there was practically no line around that time. About an hour ish later, the hungry mob decided to pounce on the scene for dinner. We should've came earlier...  The ratchet crew of 9 homies were hungry and wanted some good ol' tacos. Good thing was that we had some rooms at Encore, which is literally right across the street. For those of you staying in Encore, Wynn, even Palazzo, or Venetian, this place is a short walk. For you inebriated post-club folks who just partied at one of Steve Wynn's venues, Tacos El Gordo is within stumbling/crawling distance. On Fridays and Saturdays, they close up shop around 4am. Keep that in mind just in case you get carried away, falling in love in the club and time is just whizzing by. Other nights, I believe they close their doors around 2am.  The lineup situation is a little weird. It's not difficult to figure out, but is it efficient? When you get passed the front glass doors, look for the signs above each station. Depending on the kind of meat/cuts, that is what will be available at that particular station. For example, the far left station had pork cuts. To the right were the beef options. There's another station around the corner too. If you want pork, then figure out what form you want it in and how many of it you want. Send someone else to another line to get the beef. You can cross order from the same station. Sorry, there's no chicken or vegetarian options here. It's all pork or beef. If you're getting quite the number of items, make sure to grab an orange tray. Sometimes there's plenty of it and sometimes their rare as $h!t to find. If you're by yourself and you want everything on the darn menu, you're practically screwed and will have a joyful time lining up in every single line they got. So don't come solo when it's busy!  After you finally get all the food you want, you walk to the other side of the glass doors to pay. There you can order any non-alcoholic drinks. Practically only fountain drinks and some of the known aqua frescas stuff. For horchata lovers like myself, it's available and it's all self-served, refills A-OKAY all day. Being that it was a full house and I decided to get into two separate lines for food plus paying and getting my drink. I think the entire process took well over an hour by the time I was able to finally consume my tacos. As much as I love tacos, it's quite a long time for just tacos. Sure, the food here is enjoyable. However, if you have to wait that long for everything, besides trying to find a table and if you're rolling deep or kind of drunk, it can get old real fast.   The carne was probably my favorite while the boys loved the pork options. I waited extra in the around the corner line for some suadero and that was kind of a letdown. Besides tacos, you can get quesadillas, fries, sopes, mulas, and tostadas with the same available meat options. If you have the patience or if there's no line, then definitely give this infamous taco spot a shot. There's no hurt in trying it out. It's double the price of the street tacos I'm use to in LA, but it's definitely cheaper than many of the dining options in the fancy hotels that are located nearby. Personally, I'll only cruise through when the lines aren't so long or when I'm hammered and don't have any concept of time.",

Coooked right in front you. Good solid flavor. Adobaba still is my favorite. Make sure to grab some grilled green onions and jalepenos for free! Just ask.   Lengua: 8.5/10:  just that delicious fatty tongue. 2nd faorvite thing on menu. Tender and juicy  Cabeza: 8/10: just try it! It's good.   Other than that. The lines are kine past 12am.  You may be waiting an hour or so.  Remember depending on what taco you want there is a separate line for that.  Its displayed in pretty big letters . Can't miss.   Usually 3-4 tacos will fill any ones belly.  At 2.25 or so a pop.  It's a great deal",

By the time my husband came to the table his tacos that I ordered for him were cold. The tacos were great! But the way they have the whole ordering system is frustrating. I guess it has worked for them to have the line moving faster. When in Vegas, these are the tacos that must try!",

Your patience will be tested if you're an impatient mutha like me... but your patience WILL pay off.  My most important piece of advice to you is to make sure you are in the correct line for the type of food you want... there are labels at the front of each line.  These tacos are tremendous.  They are also very fairly priced, because although they're pretty small - they're also just $2.  I ordered 3 and had wished I ordered 6 (seriously, 6... they're not that big).  Worth a trip to the northern end of the strip for these, just make sure you have some time to wait.",

The one thing that bummed me out is there are several different lines throughout the restaurant and each line is where you order a different item. Example- I ordered carnitas tacos and adobada fries and I had to wait in 2 separate lines to order! This is confusing enough to the sober restaurant goer, but add a million drunk Vegas crazies to the mix (the restaurant is always packed) and it makes getting your order in a nightmare. Luckily their food more than makes up for this design flaw-- go check them out!",

I don't like any of that guacamole sauce they put on it. They have signs to let you know what each line is for so make sure and pay attention because these lines can be mad crazy. If you like grilled peppers and veggies then ask for a plate of them free of charge. You can also ask them to put foil on your plate if you want it to go or you can sit at tables they have set up under a tent style area outside. If you like good ass tacos them come here.",

Tacos Al Pastor are my hands down favorite and you need to get them with everything on top, including the pineapple which sits at the top of the spit.

Only for this place, of course. The carne asada tacos are good though, but the spicy pork is better. Get the Adobada fries too! delicious!

Two carne asada and two adobada line really keeps the line short. Also, when we went, there were plenty of seating, no table reserving and scouting required.  I am sure both tacos in LV and SD are made the same, but something about the tacos in SD were more flavorful and fulfilling.  With that said, the tacos were delicious either way. For the LV folks visiting SD, stop by a Tacos El Gordo and find out.",

    "text": "Came here right when it opened at 10 a.m. so there was no line up. Score. There are a couple different stations and you go up to the meat that you want your in your taco and order from that station. I tried the adobada which I found out was another name for al pastor. It is the favorite there, and for good reason! I had to ask for my slice of pineapple and make sure to get the grilled green onion and jalapeno on the side. The grilled onion is really amazing. I was a little bit skeptical, I mean I'm from LA. I like to eat tacos, and I wasn't sure how Las Vegas would deliver. It was really delicious. The sope was not as good as I thought it would be and the vampiro is just a sope with a tostada \"lid\" on top. See also got adobada fries but save yourself the stomach space and just fill up on tacos.",

Al pastor, tripas, carne asada, chorizo, buche, and pollo asado. Either in taco, tostada or sope. All are soooo good. The grilled onions and chiles are just as good. The only down fall is the ordering and paying process. Especially when its super packed. Which is ALWAYS. DONT LET IT STOP YOU!!!",

They do have different cooks for different meat, depending on your order. Each cook takes pride in serving your tacos. There are plenty of salsas to choose depending the taco. I thought the salsa of avocado was the best. Other salsas are also good.  This place is not expensive. I had five tacos with a fountain drink for 13.00.

THE only thing that is great about this place, is just that. The food. The way they operate does not make sense. Different lines for different products, which result in longer lines, longer wait times, and if you're going to get more than one kind of meat (or product), make sure to come with someone as you both will have to go to different lines, otherwise be prepared to stand in line again for a long period of time. I stood in line for over 20 minutes (yes, foolish), but didn't know where else to get tacos. Definitely will look for somewhere else before I return here!",

ALso the case register is in the little corner and they do watch you to make sure you pay. They dont sell beer but people bring in their own and they ask that you cover it",

I accidentally ordered the sesos not knowing what it was and since it came out all white and mushy looking, I gave it all to A to eat and am glad I did since those are cow brains. I really wish they wouldn't just put beef on their menus and explain which part of it it is! The carne asada was just ok to me so I went back and ordered another two abodaba and a suadero, which is beef brisket. The suadero is super salty, which is just how I like it and I devoured the abodaba quickly. I got one on a flour tortilla for A but stuck to the corn myself. I usually don't like corn tortillas but these were so good! I would order a whole bunch of abodaba and one suadero if I ever came back and I definitely want to.",

Stick to the off fatty cuts, cabeza, buche, tongue, the al pastor is good, but make sure you get the slice pineapples with it. Anyway for the price point coming from a native East Los Angeleno taco truck addict, it's to expensive for what you get, beware a dollar here there for certain cuts add on's etc. But all in all it's a solid taco place. Pro tip have your Uber driver drop you off and go to the Charleston Blvd location to avoid the long lines.",

Let me start with the entrance first. When you first walk in there are 4 lines to choose from. All with different items being made. It's pretty easy to know which line you want to go with by just looking at the signs. I chose to stay in the carne asada line. The line moved pretty quickly and in no time I was ordering tacos. It's awesome how you can see them cooking and cutting the meat right in front of you. As soon as you order they make your tacos in front of you and that in itself is great.  The only confusing part I have to say is as soon as you get your food you have to again go to a different line to pay. I wasn't quite sure where to go but after looking around I found it. My recommendation is that when you get your food they should tell you where to go next. Instead, I got my food and then was pretty much left to fend for my self. A simple nudge would be great.  The food was amazing. The flavor of the meat was phenomenal as well the great wood smoke flavor it had. I also loved the tripas. They were sof and tender and again the flavor was top notch.I'll definitely come back again especially since it will be a smoother routine now that I know where all the lines are and where I'm supposed to go.",

    "text": "This is the newer location of Tacos El Gordo. A lot more convenient then the Downtown location if you are on the strip!  The parking lot is free but super tiny, the plaza is always full.  The ordering line system is terrible here, just like the Downtown location. They have 3 different lines for different cuts of meat. So if you want multiple types of meat, you have to stand in different long ass lines. Better to come with others so you can all stand in different lines.   After you order, you go to the register and pay. I still wonder how many people get there food and just bounce without paying.   Taco De Adobada - $2.40 - Pork had a very light kick, not spicy, and loaded with onions and cilantro.   Tacos De Cabeza - $2.60 - Tender and flavorful. Good fatty pieces mixed in.   Tacos De Lengua - $2.60 - More beef flavor then the asada meat.    Taco De Tripa - $ 2.40 - Tripe was stewed well and had a good chew.  Asada Fries, half - $7 -  Steak was seasoned perfectly. Cut unevenly though, you get big chunks and small pieces. Fries were soft thin fries and loaded with cheese meat and guac. One of the best Mexican fries I have ever had.   Grilled Peppers - Free and freaking legit. Grilled soft and tender and so good!  Still one of the best taco joints I have been too!",

    "text": "So after a late night of adult beverages, some of the guys were hungry (nothing to see here, folks). Since we were near the strip, someone suggested Tacos El Gordo. I'd heard great things about this place and I was in the market for something with carne asada on it, so I was more than willing to go along. Parking is in their own lot and a security guard lets you in (and he pushes a barrier up) so it's a bit different.  When you walk in, you order your food and they give you a ticket to pay at a register across the restaurant. I was a bit on the buzzed side so the carne asada fries were calling me and at $7 for late night eats, well damn I'm A-OK with that. I got my food and damn it looked amazing. A foam container loaded to the gills with fries, asada, cheese, sour cream and guac....then I tasted it.  BLAND. It just didn't compute. Everything looked so good but it was a big ball of \"meh\". Even the asada, which I made sure to try separately didn't even taste marinated. Just...salted. Now, maybe the pastor, lengua or chicken was better but I'm just going off of what I had. Is Tacos El Gordo good for late night eats? Sure, the prices are pretty good (for Vegas) and the hours can't be beat. I guess I'm spoiled by living in So Cal where you can throw a rock and hit a good taquiera. Any of them blow Tacos El Gordo away but location, location, location!",

My favorite would have to be lengua and my boyfriend's is tripa. You basically go in and order from each line depending on what meat you'd like then you pay at the register - pretty simple/quick system. Three tacos would get you pretty full (my boyfriend ate 7) and it's less than $3 a taco so imagine a cheap, quick, delicious lunch!",

I got the steak and pork tacos, as well as the carne asada fries and everything was delicious. The meats are perfectly seasoned, each taco is served with guacamole, onions/cilantro, and one the best salsas I've had! Be careful though, it has a bit of a kick to it so those who can't eat spicy.. go without it, it'll still taste great! The carne asada fries are a must, fried perfectly and a huge portion size! You come in, grab a tray and get in line to order. They have multiple lines offering different kinds of meat. It can be tough to find a seat in here, so be prepared for that but definitely try this place if you have the chance!",

From chorizo, asada, Al pastor, adobada, lengua, tripa, and more there really is something for everyone. Unfortunately, we didn't try their loaded fries with meat but looked amazing. The Al Pastor was everyone's favorite and the way they slice the meat off the spit makes it for a nice presentation. Loved how soft but still tender the lengua was bc a lot of places either make it very tough or extremely chewy.  Overall, definitely worth the trip if in Vegas area. Please don't order the same thing, portions and prices are small so you can order and try more.",

The lines move pretty fast depending on the quantity the people before you order. The lines break up into 3 different lines depending on which meat you prefer to help break down lines, but the middle line is always the longest regardless because of the choices of meat served there. This place was kinda a get your food and then pay after type of thing which I was surprised. The food was sooo filling and and the meat was also great!! I tried spicy pork which was amazing!! And I also got cabeza, lengua, & asada which were all 10/10!!!! I will be back when in Vegas cause it's so easy to eat!",

So good the place is packed all throughout the day.  Usually hard to find a seat but they do have indoor and outdoor seating.  Parking is good because it's right next to a mini mall.  They are on honor system because you order the tacos at one of about 6 windows and they call you up, then you have to go to the register to pay. As always I recommend the carne asada but that's because I'm biased when it comes to tacos.  Although the lines are long, they go quick as the workers are very good and fast at what they do.",

I had the asada tacos and the asada quesadilla. I also tried the carne asada fries. Out of those three items, the fries were the tastiest. The carne asada was lacking flavor, it was dry, and my tacos were cold by the time I paid my check (about 5 minutes after I got the tacos). The tortillas are good compared to other street tacos I've had, but that's where it ends. The meat needs flavor and it was not soft at all. King Taco is better.",

Coming from SoCal, I consider myself a bit of a taco snob lol  Im always down for a good asada, pastor or chorizo taco. I love a good salsa, and guac is my fav.  We came to this location at 3am, on a Sunday morning. The lines were crazy long. As we approached, the senora came out to tell us there was no pastor or chorizo. I ordered 4 asada tacos, con todo, but they had no guac. Double whammy!!!  They put the red sauce on my tacos and I went to pay.  There wasn't much room to sit, but when we did, I took my first bite. The tortilla itself was bomb! Home made corn... yum! The meat was bland as hell and very dry.  Needed salt and seasoning! The salsa wasn't spicy and it lacked something. I put a ton of lime juice for and got some salt packets for moisture and flavor. After that, the taco was decent.  Honestly, I've had better. Prob. Would be never go here again. Maybe it was good when it first opened, but it almost tasted like it was thrown together carelessly, with no respect for the food.  If you're going to be open 24 hours, you should have consistency on the quality of your food. Maybe the rush is too much to handle.",

We also had the great fortune of coming on a Sunday night in February -- there's still a line to order, sure, but it was not nearly as long as this place is known for.   For a newcomer, the ordering system can be confusing. Basically, there's four places around the open kitchen where you can order. Order directly from the cook. Once the food is prepared, take your tray to the cashier in the corner and pay. That part of the process seems to take less time, but, with only one cashier on duty, you're bound to wait a while. Have someone in your group save seats, if possible. It was chaotic enough for us, so I can't even imagine how it is during the summertime.   This eatery offers tacos, quesadillas, carne asada fries, mulas, tostadas and sopes. Don't expect fish, shrimp or chicken here. This place strictly serves pork and beef. I get it -- Tacos El Gordo wants to stay genuine and traditional.   Interested patrons do need to know that the menu is limited, though, in case that's a dealbreaker.   We ordered the lengua (beef tongue) taco, the quesadilla with meat, the carne asada (steak) taco and the spicy pork taco -- all for $12. Everything was delicious, but the spicy pork taco was definitely the favorite of the meal. Love the sauce it comes with, too.   No idea when I'd have enough patience to come back in the months to come, but I'll absolutely try to. This place is worth it, and so are the prices.",

There's a line for each meat and if you're by yourself then you have to wait in one line then go to a different line and wait all over if you want different tacos. Could be waiting up to 30 mins after waiting outside to get in. I got the carne asada and the al pastor and both were delicious! I couldn't decide which is better. Would have to make another stop back before leaving Vegas",

    "text": "Overrated and chaotic.   The process:  3 different lines   - asada    - al pastor/adobada   - guts, tongue, suadero, cabeza, etc.   If you want one of each, guess what? You have to make 3 different lines and stand in each one for a LONG TIME.  You take your tray to the register and pay after getting your tacos. You can then sit and eat.   Our last day in Vegas and I have heard all the hype of these tacos so I had to have them. The place opens at 10 am we arrived at 9:30 am. The doors were already opened but they were not serving until 10 am.  The lines were formed and there is no one there at the entrance to guide you where to go. Thank god I had already seen the yelp reviews and read you have to stand in a separate line depending on what you want to order. There were 4 of us and we wanted 3 different things. One of us secured a table, 1 stood at the asada line, 1 stood at the lengua line and 1 stood at adobada line. The place is really chaotic. The staff are like busy bees and I was not that far from the counter in the adobada line. Finally go to the front after about 30 min. The lady in front of me flagged an employee and asked what should she do since she is in the line for al pastor and wants to also eat asada tacos, her response was that she had to make a second line. Which is ridiculous.   By this time the line outside was wrapping around the location. Thank god it was more than 1 in my party but I felt bad for that lady.   My bf and I ordered 1 quesadilla de asada, 1 mulita de asada, 3 tacos de asada and 2 tacos al pastor with 2 cans of coke.   They have a little bar where you can get radishes and limes. If you want salsa or onions and cilantro, guess what? You have to walk thru all those people and head to the front of the counter where you get your tacos and ask for it.   Luckily when we were paying I noticed they had some salsas there and asked for extra salsa, the lady gave me 1. 1 small ounce container of salsa. I asked if we have to pay for extra salsa and she said no, gave me one more. That bothered me so much. Jesus Christ, don't be so stingy with the salsa, I'll pay for it if it'll break you. With as many customers as this place gets you would think they would have a bar with the salsas, limes, radishes etc. but apparently not.   We paid over $30.00 and I only liked the asada tacos. The quesadilla was a joke. The mulita was a joke as well.   The quesadilla was a corn tortilla a little bigger than the taco tortillas with a dash of cheese and chopped carne asada. Not worth the $4+. The mulita was 2 tortillas with literally a slice of white cheese and chopped asada. It had a drizzle of red salsa. No guac like the tacos or anything else. Again, not worth the $4+.   I love TJ tacos more than anyone else and this place didn't come close. Sorry. We have better tacos in LA than this place.   You're food will be cold by the time you get to your seat even if you're not spending more time at other lines trying to get a different kind of meat taco. Tacos are consumed hot before the tortilla gets hard and the fat solidifies.   I wanted to like this place so much but unfortunately, its WAY overrated.",

We got the pork and the steak taco. The horchata was good but not made with milk, but tasted authentic. Their roasted onions and peppers were awesome!   Get the crunchy tortilla, they toast it and it has a rustic flavor, so good!   Love you guys!",

As you wait in the huge line you will see a beautiful spit of seasoned pork rotating gently around a vertical grill. The meat is glistening and popping with spices and fat. The artist serving you your taco toasts the tortillas on a flat bed under the al pastor to soak up all the juicy drippings, before shaving a giant portion of heavenly pork into your taco. If you are wise, you will ask for all the toppings, so that you get a healthy dose of both the green and red salsa, and fresh veggies. Top with lime juice  and enjoy!",

    "text": "Tacos El Hot Mess - is more like it!!!  Como se dice (how do you say) Jamas!  Never again.   Followed the rave reviews from friends and of course all these Yelp \"Elites\".     Only to leave completely frustrated and disappointed .   Coming to Vegas we always Thought, man, this places needs some good tacos, Mexican food, or Mariscos/seafood joint for the late night munchies.    Maybe that was our mistake, we went here before even checking in, so it was afternoon, not late night, no Booz, no partying yet.  We were sober!!! Maybe that is why we were able to get the real deal. Maybe if I was drunk I would think the food and all the chaos was the greatest.    First the line, not so bad at 3 pm.  Compared to every other day we saw the line completely go out the door and around the entire seating area.  We went straight in when we arrived.  So not that bad upon arrival.  Can't say the same once indoors. Now we had to put our brains together to come up with a strategy on what we wanted and decide on what lines to get in.  This to me has to be the DUMBEST format for any eating establishment ever!!!    So, we were already there, my wife and I had to split up she hit the Al Pastor line for the Pork on the spinning spit.  I hit the carne asada line.   My wife wanted tripe. When I asked the guy if there were any way to get some buche and tripe tacos without getting g back in line.  He said in a whatever tone, no.  That's that line and pointed.  Again, the DUMBEST format ever.  Who wants to get in line again with food in hand?     So of course by the time we got our food we didn't feel like having to get in yet another line, and risk our food get all cold and soggy and covered in flies. So we said nah.     Now the battle to pay.  Two cashiers and another line to wait to pay.  This place is total chaos.  Honestly, we could have just walked out without paying and no one would notice due to the mad chaos in this place.  But, we were nice and paid.    Mr. Gordo.  Mr El Fat Boy.  Please fix this.  Easy fix for you.  Make one like. Cafeteria line.  Have everyone go through all the stations, have the cashiers at the end and everyone can and move on to pay.  They don't want pork, move on to next station, no asada, move on, tripe no, move on.  I wanted them all, so I could have gotten some at each station and paid and would not have to battle with other customers to pay or contemplate just walking out amidst the chaos without paying.  Just do something about it. It is RIDICULOUS!!!!    We opted to eat outside and had to be on constant guard for giant flies trying to swoop down and carry our tacos away!!     After all the chaos. I can truly say that these were NOT the best tacos we've had or even with the wait, chaos, or frustration.  Nah.  I live in LA.  Good tacos are a dime a dozen here.  The best review I can give these tacos is \"edible but disappointing\".  Asada has absolutely no flavor.  Al Pastor was just ok.   I am not a fan of King Taco.  But even King Taco is better than this.    If you have plenty of time to waster in Vegas and a high tolerance for chaos, and disappointment, this is the place for you to get just OK tacos along with a headache, and dissatisfaction.  Otherwise, use the time to go get some drinks have fun and get any other tacos anywhere you can find them you may be better off!!   Yelp Elite's - ",

The al pastor tacos are always a solid choice, but their carne asada is also worth trying. And if you're really hungry, why get tacos when you can get them in fries? Or if you're feeling indulgent, get them in mulas? My one main gripe, is that they don't have chicken tacos, but not having that is not enough to knock a star off. Overall, this is one of my favorite taco shops in town, and it also happens to be right down the street from my house, so it's a win win.",

I'm from LA where we have taco stands on every corner (That's an exaggeration, don't get emotional now).   As soon as I took a bite of that Alpastor (pork) taco I was thrown into another dimension (Ok, enough with the exaggerations.) This place has some great Alpastor tacos! I have never eaten tacos that good in my life! And I eat tacos at least once a week!  The line was worth the wait. This review is only for the pork tacos.",

    "text": "I've been going to their location in Chula Vista religiously for a few years, so it was only right that I try this location. I'm pleased to say that this location is just as good as the one down south. After all, consistency is key!  What I need to emphasize is that this location gets BUSY. They open at 10am with a line already, and by 11:30am, the line is out the door. It seems like there's a perpetual line! Let me clarify-- there is a line outside that you wait in just to get inside to wait into another line to order your food. If you can deal with this, you truly will be awarded.  My favorite meat to get here is hands down the Adobada. There's just something about charred, spicy pork that is just downright delicious. Their tacos come loaded with onions, cilantro, salsa and an avocado/sour cream sauce. You really can't go wrong, and I'm always good for 5-6 tacos.  If you're courageous, I'd also recommend their fries. The fries are topped with your choice of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. They keep it super simple, which I appreciate. They have two sizes, with the large size being a very generous portion. My only gripe is that sometimes you don't get as much meat as you think you should (after all, it is $13), but that's never stopped me.",

I'm a huge fan of the adobada (spicy pork) fries and pretty much any of the other meat tacos. If you are unfamiliar with how this place works, there are different lines depending on the choice of meat you want. You order your tacos first and then pay afterwards. I think its best to have a different person in each line to order for you, that's if you come with a group and then pay all together so that it is an easier process. I'm glad they added an outside section so that there's more space for seating. I'm happy they have locations in San Diego now but I can't wait until they have some in Los Angeles! I would highly recommend this place if you haven't gone yet! You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Are you interested in waiting in line for over an hour for \"just okay\" Mexican food? Well you are at the right place! Tacos El Gordo is supposedly a highly rated and preferred restaurant from what I've heard. This past visit would make number two for me and again I'm left with too much more to desire. I arrived with already have anticipating a long wait, that's a given! Day before a holiday(Thanksgiving) on the Las Vegas strip? Yeah you'd think everybody would be home that night preparing some Thanksgiving dinner but nope!   Organization is something that could've possibly earned this place another star from me but the jury is still out on that. This location unlike the other one I have visited in town didn't seem to have a very good process in place for the crazy line. For starters, those of you who've never been there is about 4 different lines that they normally offer, depending on what kind of meat you want on your order decides on what line you should be standing. That wasn't the case this weekend. Upon arrival I noticed there was a security guard outside which I didn't think too much of because in my mind I thought he just patrolled the entire parking lot. No.. He is designated specifically just for Tacos El Gordo and manning the traffic that goes in and out? Seriously? What the hell goes on here that they need security at a Mexican fast food joint? Inquiring minds would really like to know... Once inside there was a \"snake line\" meaning that there wasn't no lining up according to the meat you want. Complete chaos! The capacity of the place easily fills up and so the security guard at some points of the wait had to stand in front of the door and make sure that it never exceeds I guess the capacity of what's allowed. Oh okay is this what he is here for? Yikes!  Hungry as I was I just couldn't have an order of a couple tacos. I thought I would treat myself to some campechana fries which is a mixture of the \"Al Pastor\" and \"Carne Asada\" meats. Large order will run you $13! Once I was to the ordering station I clearly stated that my choice of order was campechana! The man taking the order and also making the food was an excellent multi-tasker and I really have to commend him on his fast skills! 5 minutes later my order was being prepared and I noticed that the fries were being made without the \"Al Pastor\" I politely brought this to their attention. Fixed! When my order was being handed to be I guess there was another customer who ordered the same that didn't get his, by the time I took a few steps my order was snatched lol yes.. snatched from another guy. The worker saw this apologized and made me another! Security?! Umm yeah we have a campechana fry snatcher on the loose! On to the next line.. To pay.. I waited another 5 minutes so now we are talking a whole hour and fifteen minutes for some damn fries! Geezee! $14 and some change later I was on my way. Will I be back? Honestly no time soon. I just can't cope with paying $14 for some fries that weren't that spectacular. Whether you want to compare them or not I literally would prefer the Carne Asada fries from Roberto's over these I just ordered and oh save $5! Tacos El Gordo my friend you are just \"iight\"... **side eye**",

There are separate lines once you get inside for the different options. There are two lines open for just adobada. ai enjoyed the lengua tacos. Also ordered a half order of the lengua fries. Was not impressed by the fries at all but at least they put a lot of meat on it so that was a plus. I got a small dollop of guac but my fiance got a huge amount for his. Our food was not proportioned the same. Location is super convenient if you're in the north strip area.",

If you can make it here during the week, even better.  I've been here several times now and it's usually the same identical experience. Tacos are about $2.25.-$2.40 each taco. Parking, same thing. Weekday ok, weekend forget it. Overall, good place to eat tacos.",

I love the part how they added guacamole for the carne asada tacos. The horchata, especially from the soda machines was superb. It tastes like the type of authentic horchata I would taste like from Santa Ana taco food trucks. The only bad thing is that I wish the cashiers knows how to speak better English because I only wanted one drink, but she charged me for two drinks, oh well. When I was in Vegas for 6 days, the last three days, I have been just eating tacos mostly lol. Can't get rid of the taco taste. Can't wait to get them when I'm in Vegas again.",

I've had street  tacos in Mehico City and these are the real deal Holyfield! I'm speaking specifically about the carne adobada al pastor kind on flower tortillas. Ask nicely and you can get flour tortillas instead of the corn too. Hey.... I'm a gringo!  You get the crispy pork, red hot sauce, green sauce, onions and cilantro. Hold the cilantro on mine! They are amazing! I can't comment on the other types of tacos they serve because these were so good I didn't get around to trying any of the others.  I went multiple times on out trip to Vegas. I couldn't get enough! They also have a pineapple fountain drink that reminds me of an Orange Julius. Very sweet but very good!  I planned my next trip to Vegas around this place. We will be staying at the Wynn Encore which is right across the street! If you have to wait in line do so.. it's very worth it!  This place is legit!",

Order from the station that is serving what you want, there are several stations and there is some overlap of what you can get from each one.  The guy who greeted us who was working behind the counter was really helpful.  He was also patient, b/c it took us a while to figure things out and to order.  Lucky for us there was no line (we also lucked out with parking).  We ate here sober fyi, I can only imagine that this place would be even better if you were drunk.  I really like the tortillas and the sauce and you can ask for grilled green onions and peppers for free.  Also if you want to be fancy and also enjoy your taco more, ask for some pineapple on top.  It is such a tasty bonus!  The dining area was clean and they did a great job wiping down tables, taking trays etc.  They had a good system going.  They also had a bathroom and the sink was outside the bathroom which was helpful.  After eating, I had to wash my hands and was glad I didn't have to wait in line for the bathroom just to do that.  The tacos are also affordable and provide a good value.  You really can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Tacos el gordo, what a great name. Made our way over here by uber and arrived at 11am. They open at 10am and the place was packed. When we left there was a line forming on the sidewalk. There are several lines to order from. If you want carne asada/steak there are several lines, then lines for other types of meat. It was confusing at first but then we got the concept. Personally, I thought the concept was a bit weird because if you want a carne asada taco and a lengua taco you need to stand in 2 separate lines. Probably not to cross contaminate the meat but it was kind of lame. The line I stood in took like what it seemed forever and a day. When you finally make it to the front you need to shout out your order. It took us 20 minutes to get to the front of our line and another 5 to prepare the food. The cooks are pretty good about getting everything but they will more than likely ask you again. It is very hot inside so be ready for that.   Once you get your food make your way over to the register and pray there is a seat available. We got lucky and scored a couple. We ordered a total of 6 tacos and 2 fountain drinks for $18. One of the least expensive meals I have ever had on the strip in Vegas.    Tortillas are freshly made. The portions are generous. At $2.25/taco you are getting a good deal. Mainly because the guacamole is not an additional charge and you get a huge portion on top. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 taco Azteca which is a carne asada taco topped with nopales (cactus). I loved my tacos. I thought they were phenomenal. People were friendly. I would go back if the lines were shorter. It is 5-stars for the food but ordering food in different lines wasn't my thing. I'm sure it works for them. Give them a try. The tacos will not disappoint. Happy eating!",

I ordered all of the 'safe' normal stuff - carne asada, chorizo, carnitas, and they were great. Carnes asade was my favorite! Beef had amazing flavor and the melange of onions. lime and guac was great. I would say this is the best carne asada taco I've had. I'd say the chorizo and carnitas lacked a bit of flavor and the texture was a bit dry but still good. My favorite thing here, was their peppers. You can ask for roasted veggies/peppers on the side free of charge! They have both green and white and they complemented the tacos to perfection. Cook well, a bit too well (slightly brown/black) but they were just cooked to perfection. Texture was hard on the outside, soft on the inside.  I'd recommend everyone to hit this place up, and not some other taco place. It's impossible to miss.",

It's across the street from Encore and it gets a little sketchy but totally worth it! I came Wednesday over winter break, a little before midnight, and I was very surprised that there was minimal waiting. They have different lines so be prepared to split your group up to try all the meats. And don't be conservative with the amount of food you order here because the tacos are on the smaller side and you won't want to wait again in the line!  The guys that make your tacos are so quick and they cut the meat on the spot when you order. El Pastor is always my favorite and don't forget to order it with the pineapples and Carne Asada would come up us as a close second. My least favorite was the Chorizo because it was a little overdone and dry. I got a chance to try a couple Mulas but it does take awhile for them to make. I was too lazy to wait in the line again so next time, I'm going to try their Carne Asada fries. After you're done ordering, you go to the counter by the exit to pay. Tacos are a little over $2 bucks each, which isn't bad considering it's on the strip.  P.S. Don't forget to ask for roasted peppers and grilled veggies, free of charge!",

Had stopped by during a layover in the city and expected to have time to go check out another landmark, but I must have been in line for at least 40 minutes because it was such so packed. (Line out the building and around the corner patio area). Once you move up in the line you get to watch the cooks moving quickly almost in a symphony orquestrating some savory and mouth watering tacos. So on top of the long line, another hassle is that with the way the store is set up you have to pick what type of meat you will want for your tacos and then commit to that because you would have to get back in another line to get other meat. So, definitely come here! Just be ready to stand for a while in line unless you come during some random hours.",

    "text": "The experience here was absolutely amazing. My friends and I came to this place around 11 AM on a Friday, and luckily the lines were not that long. Right after we finished ordering though, the lines were going out the door... I don't think you can ever avoid lines at this place!  Food: I had ordered the abodaba tacos and asada tacos. They were $2.50 each, which is a bit pricey for tacos, but we know this place is known for great quality so that was fine. I wish I got some more abodaba tacos because they were amazing and my friends were raving about chorizo tacos! Honestly, the asada tacos were really good but I think I can get that kind of taste at any taco stands. Nonetheless, they were all yummy! I only ordered 3 tacos and I was still hungry lol. My friends and I decided to split the carne asada fries, which was the best decision I made during my Vegas trip. It was SO good, and nothing back home will beat the taste.  P.S. Get the horchata, you won't regret it.   Seating: The place has lots of places to sit, except there are so many people there. We had to often tell people that seats were taken while my friends went to go use the restroom or wait in line for some more food.  Service: it was okay. The people who work there are not nice, but they're not rude either. They do look like they don't want to be there. Also, the workers take your trays and trash for you, which is really nice, but they do it in a way so that you'll leave and make room for other people. We understood we couldn't stay for long, but we ate pretty rushed. Other than that, it wasn't a too bad of an experience!  If you're ever in Vegas or SD, you should definitely check out this place!",

This past weekend we went to Vegas to celebrate my cousins 25th birthday, and all weekend I was really craving tacos. Finally, before leaving I told them lets go and they agreed. For once the lines weren't out the door like they normally are which made me really excited. I was a bit overwhelmed as to what to get but finally decided on 2 tacos and a mulita de asada.  The tacos are Ok and have hand made tortillas. They are not stingy with their meat, sauce or guacamole which is a plus. The mulitas were made the same way and had sooooo much cheese in which I love. The downside to the food was the Carne Asada was wayyyyyyy too salty.   I'm giving it 3 stars because I feel like it's just all hype. I've had better tacos in LA. Also the fact the meat was really salty. Maybe next time it'll be better.",

    "text": "Overall: Tacos El Gordo is overhyped. Definitely stop by if you're on the strip and you want a quick, cheap bite. Otherwise, there are better places to eat.  Food: 3  I ordered a taco de cabeza, lengua, and suadero. I was not a fan of the suadero because the meat is a little stringy, but the cabeza and lengua were tender. The corn tortilla was too soft and falling apart.  In respect to other eateries on the strip, you can't get much cheaper than Tacos El Gordo. But if you have time, off strip food is way cheaper and tastier. Plus, if you come from a place with an abundance of Mexican food like me, you're better off waiting until you get home where a taco is half the price and at least as tasty.  Service: 4  Tacos El Gordo has an interesting concept for ordering. There are signs pointing to where you should line up depending on what you want. Once you have your food, you go to the front counter to pay.  The lines weren't too long when I came because it was a weekday night, but I'm sure it moves fast even if it were long. The cooks work at a rapid pace.  Ambiance: 4  The restaurant is decently clean and well-lit, and there's plenty of tables to choose from. Parking doesn't seem too bad.",

Also they basically are cooking the food right in front of you which is super cool because you see how fast they whip everything up. I ordered two tacos de pastor and an order of carne asada fries and it was so delicious ! Expect the place to be packed because the food is so good!! I was wondering why the carne asada fries were 13 bucks and it's because the box it comes in is huge! Literally can feed for sure 2-3 people ! Will definitely be coming back when I come out to Vegas again !",

So this is the normal, which is odd for an authentic looking taco stand style restaurant right across the street from Wynn and Encore! But I guess, the key is \"authentic Mexican\", I would say more than their just N of the border location, and they make everything in front of you and put them together on a small plate that you walk away with, and pray to heavens that you find a table! But the tacos are awesome, try them all if you can, the Vampiro Is my favorite! Ask for grilled peppers and green onions, also get as many radishes you can from the salsa bar. It's a fun experience, more fun than gambling!",

My kids didn't even finish their food and neither did I. I ended up eating the meat with a fork because the tortilla was nasty, and cold by the time I sat down. The meat had no flavor and neither did the salsas. I ended up adding lemon and salt to find some taste. I noticed they are opening another location and closing the original spot. I hope the new place has better quality food...",

I usually never order horchata but here, it's not even an option for me. Yes please!  Walking in, newcomers usually have a problem learning how everything works. You have to stand in different lines for different types of meat. Pork (adobada) line, carne asada line, lengua line etc. After you order and take your food from the lines, then you walk to the cashier to pay. If you're smart, you stand in one line and your friend stands in another line.   The tacos are a great size and they're about 2 bucks each. I don't care what your preference is here, if it's your first time, you HAVE to try the spicy port Adobada tacos with everything on it!",

This place is all the way north of the strip, near Encore. We took a taxi because it was 109 degrees outside and I sure as heck didn't feel like walking from Vdara.  Now, this place is legit. And their system is great. Meat. Line. Meat. Line. Pay. We got 3 carne asada tacos, 3 spicy pork tacos and 1 sesos taco (beef brains). We loved the spicy pork and the creamy sauce that came with it. It also had a bit of a kick, but not crazy spicy. Actually it could've been spicier. It was delicious. Carne asada was smoky and had a delicious charred flavor. Came with some guac too, which I love on tacos. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Sesos was off, texture wise. It was too squishy and soft, kind of reminded me of chicarrons.   They have orange bang too!!! Yum!! The lines move quickly since there's 2 areas. Each taco is $2 simple and easy. Loved all the flavors. Definitely an awesome local spot!",

There is a salsa bar and previously I never had to use any salsa because the great Mexican flavors spoke for themselves without any help from the salsa bar, but now there just isn't that flavorful seasoning that kept me coming back nearly once every week. The one noticeable improvement is the carne asada taco in which the quality of the meat is much I improved over the previous fatty version. The price per taco is now $2.10 so they increased the price by 10 cents, but who cares? A feature that is no longer there is the huge red tent where you could dine outside and enjoy your food on the Law Vegas strip. Also new is the armed guard that is protecting diners from attacking taco thieves and it's a comforting feeling to know my tacos are safe. Who knows? one night there could be quite a show in addition to your meal, yay! Bueno? no gracias.",

What makes it worse is that the strip location has two stores within a block of each other, but one is closed. Why would it be closed when there is a line one hour long?   The system? Well, there is a line for different types of meat. So if you want a variety like I usually get, you have to wait in 3 different lines! The al pastor line was pretty quick, which was curious because I thought it was their specialty, but it was pretty average if you ask me. I think the meat is cooked on the flat top more than the spit due to lines, which makes it average in flavor. The other line is for meat like lengua and buche, which is what I also wanted. Now these were better than average and would go back for these. Arguably the best tacos and slowest line was for carne asada. If it were the longest line due to the flavors, it might be forgiven but it's just slow. Took an hour to get our food. What a pain. Adding insult to injury, there is yet another line to pay and get drinks. WTF? Retarded. So many people were confused and in wrong lines making things worse.",

We don't speak Spanish but were able to navigate the menu just fine and land ourselves some absolute authentic flavorful tacos!!    The pork tacos were by far the shining star, and I could watch the guy slicing the pork off the giant pork stacked carousel dripping in juice all day!  He was a master at it and it was an art!    The steak tacos were very good too with a slab of fresh, creamy guacamole, and freshly sliced steak.     We also tried the steak Azteca which was delicious.  Loved feeling like we stepped into Tijuana!",

I'm in Vegas quite often and had never heard of it until my cousin told me. We went and I was pleasantly pleased. It's a bit of a wait and experience. You have to know what you want and there are separate lines for things. The workers there have a system and they get the food out pretty fast. Now that I've found this place, I've been back since my first visit and I'll make a stop there in future visits.",

I could care less about going to the clubs, just let me get my tacos PLEASE.  Adobado is the best, although I do also like carne asada a lot. Everytime I'm here, I eat what should be my entire diet for the week LOL. I always get adobado, although I tell myself I should try to be more adventurous.   The tacos are $2.40 each, which I believe is more expensive than they are in SD? Or maybe they've raised their prices; anyways, the point is that tacos are not on the cheap end. Still worth though.  Love the laid back vibe. The workers here are pretty friendly and generous with what they give. My coworkers and I came here recently and asked for a TON of pineapple slices and jalapenos last time, and they obliged without any complaints or weird looks.   I also think they made another location? Not completely sure, but I saw another Tacos El Gordo like a block away, so maybe they opened another one for crowd control purposes because usually, the line be long af. BUT STILL WORTH.",

The Meat reminds me of the BBQ pork you get at a Chinese Fast Food joint, it taste and looks the same.  I can even probably swear that the meat has some sort red food coloring.  A real alPastor has natural marinade/Chile sauce that give it its taste.  This meat does not have flavor.   The green (guacamole ?) sauce is sweet and runny which Is why I say it's not Guacamole.  Yes, I did eat the tacos but that's because I was hungry and I don't like to waste food. I've definitely had better AlPastor tacos.",

Place very small for such a popular restaurant - hot and stuffy inside.  Having to get in individual meat lines to order  Very confusing for the first time.

I ordered the asada tacos and mula, the tacos were alright, enjoyed the handmade tortilla, but the meat was a little too dry to my liking. Also the pricing?? Not sure about you but I don't really know how to feel about tacos that cost more than $1.50..   Mula was quite delicious but difficult to eat as the filling would keep falling out of the tortilla sandwich.   The worst part of my dining experience here was the WAIT. I arrived around 8 and literally waited 50 minutes what appeared as a small 15-20 person line just to order tacos! It seems that the takeout line gets priority so would recommend that you call in ahead of time.   Otherwise decent tacos but unreasonable wait. Not familiar with the Vegas food scene so could be better options out there.",

Luckily for me I spoke Spanish and was able to figure out the lines. If there is a long line out the door, there is only one line. However, the line splits up inside to different kinds of meat. There are two Al Pastor lines, one Asada line and one line with Lengua, Cabeza, the works. It's hard to come here by yourself if you want to have multiple tacos. I recommend coming with someone else to split up and stand in separate lines.   The Lengua and the works line was the one I stood in. Let me tell you, it is three times slower than the Al Pastor line. They only had one guy cutting up all sorts of meat at a time. If you wanted Lengua, Cabeza or another meat as well you can expect to wait super duper long.   All in all, thought, I would one hundred percent come again. The tacos were fresh and delicious, but I would not wait in line for the Lengua. I have had better Lengua elsewhere and would just focus on filling my tummy with the Al Pastor.",

A corner joint with a line out the door that seemed a mile long.  Why am I waiting on this line for a taco???  Upon finally entering the doors we are directed to specific line that corresponds with the type of food we will be ordering.  This is not to my liking.  My wife orders, that way I don't get flustered.    Ok, after reading my first two paragraphs you may wonder why I'm giving 4 stars because so far it sure doesn't sound like a 4 star.  Well, upon diving into these types of tacos that I cannot pronounce I will tell you that my mouth was exploding with Wonderful, Bursting, Flavor that was not what my pallet was expecting.  Forget grading on a white table scale.  Taste alone sets this place apart.  4 strong stars.  Not 5 because I feel the system they have set up of individual lines for specific items of food was ridiculous and you really did have to wait an out of this world amount of time.",

Cons:   - Line was long consistently.  - Not much seating. Mostly inside with a few outside.   - When we first went in, the whole place inside was so smokey that the employees had to open up the doors to air it out. So watch out asthmatics!   - There's no salsa bar! They have a bar for lime, radish, etc., but no salsa and I was not going to wait in that line again.   Overall, I think the pros outweighed the cons. I'll definitely be coming back! You",

    "text": "This place is probably a 5 min walk from Encore. When we got there around 10 pm, there was a huge line. However, the lines are separate per station so be sure to make sure you're in the right line. The carne asada lines were out the door but the adobada al pastor lines were much shorter and started inside the restaurant so we decided to go there. You pick how many tacos you want while they shave the pork right in front of you with freshly  made tortillas. These tacos are pretty small so make sure you order enough! After you get your food, you pay at the counter and then you are ready to eat. The tacos are delicious! There was the right amount of spice and seasoning on the al pastor and the tortilla had perfect texture. I will definitely come back here to try the carne asada next time!",

    "text": "I've never really been a big fan of this Tacos El Gordo, preferred the one on Charleston if anything but still not a big fan of Tacos El Gordo.  I don't know why but somehow I seem to always find myself coming here once in awhile; people do flock over to this location because its on the Strip.  Go to the Charleston location if it's busy here it's not that far away.  Honestly I like their food only when I'm either drunk or recovering  but I could probably get the same effect from a Roberto's which is probably more convenient. Any other time I just can't enjoy them.  When it's slow, which is when they're usually still busy but manageable, you can find a parking spot easily, you walk into the building, open the door and shut the door, you wait in a decent line, and you can enjoy your meal maybe on a table inside or outside.  However when it's busy, mainly weekend, forget about coming here, unless you're willing to wait. The line usually spills out the door and it's hard to find a seat.  You'll likely find yourself joining others eating their food on the curb or at your car.   Food-wise it's alright 3 star maybe 3.5 tops which isn't that bad.  You probably heard about their carne asada and adobada fries, and their various street tacos they are a must if you never had it but personally I don't think they have enough flavor to my liking and seemed a little pricey, especially for the fries. I think I only liked them the first time I've had street tacos.  It kind of has phased out of my system, I do prefer a few other businesses more.   Overall they are probably a 2 star maybe 3  mainly because of the inconvenience and madness that goes on. Yea it's busy because a lot of people want them but they could do something better to manage the crowd besides making the food faster, I don't know maybe it's just me being picky but definitely not a fan of the atmosphere. You can say it lacks good customer service but they do make things fast.  Most recently I brought some out of state family here it lasted only a few mins. We ended up going to a pretty good regular Mexican restaurant where it was fast, excellent customer service, served good food, and accomedating for a large group wiith kids, Taco Bell joking.",

    "text": "My friends hated this place and said they will never come back. I admit the meat is good but there were a lot of other things I didn't like. Through our experience, it was packed, hectic, and wasn't as great as we thought it would be. When you go in there will be lines based on meats. Everyone talks about the carne asada fries so I decided to go in the asada line. The asada line usually goes out the door. Someone was telling me to either stay outside or go in and I wanted to go in but there was no room. So by the time I ordered I wasn't sure if the guy who was making the food heard me or not. I also ordered the tacos which came immediately. So I assumed he didn't hear me and my friends were in a different line and we wanted the same thing so I decided to join them in the last line furthest to the right. My friends said they were in line for the carne asada line, but they were actually in line for the lengua line which didn't show the asada. The line for the lengua goes to a side so you can't see what the line is for until you get about half way through. Someone in line told us that we are in the wrong line. So I wanted to make sure I wasn't in the wrong line. I asked the cashier which line is for the carne asada and she didn't speak English but she understood me and pointed at the line, the line I got the tacos in. Turns out the guy did hear me and got mad at me for stepping out of line. But he was already taking other people's orders so I got confused. I felt like the whole experience was confusing. When I finally got my food, I needed napkins and had to ask where they have the napkins. Apparently they don't give you napkins you have to ask for it.  I felt like this place has poor customer service. The first cashier that helped me was ok but the second one seemed so grumpy. They are not friendly to first comers either. They just assumed that everyone knows what they are doing.  Anyway, the food ended up being just ok. The fries were soggy but the meat is pretty good.  The food was pretty salty in general and made me super thirsty. As for coming back here, I don't think I would come back unless there was nothing else opened. But it's Vegas, so probably not. It's the city that never sleeps. Maybe the grumpy cashiers just needed to sleep?",

We ordered 14 ADOBADA tacos for both (we were really hungry). The tacos were great. We had them with the green sauce (guacamole?) and pineapple. Will definitely be back on my next trip to Las Vegas.",

Some people just walk out without paying. Kind of hard to tell who pays and who doesn't because it's so packed with drunks and smelly musty people inside. The lines are out of order--- not worth the wait and $$$. I came back into the room with my friends asking why I reek like onions--- damn you el gordo nasty crap taco!!!!",

I never seen that in any other restaurants... ok, the moment of truth!!! Starting eating ' they were bad! ..... Honestly!! We finish them cause we were very hungry, as soon as we walk out We got gases so bad & stomachache that last until the next morning!!!! Any ways may be for the owner of this place if U care about it! Make some changes, if He won't care About this cause they still have lot of ppl going right!!!  But hopefully for ppl who are about to go & read reviews b4 & read this think about it! Any other place is way better including the service..... GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!!  I'm giving one star bcs if not  Doesn't let me post!!!",

The lines look long as they go out the doors but it goes buy very quickly! Word on the street is that this place is so good/famous because they use pineapple slices in their pastor tacos and the juices from the fruit come dripping down from the top. The carne tacos are loaded with meat, cilantro, onions, and guac. The pastor is loaded with cilantro, onions, pineapple, and this yummy green sauce they have.  THIS IS A MUST STOP FOR FOODIES, YELPERS, ANYONE WHO ENJOYS FOOD WHILE YOUR OUT IN VEGAS!!! COME & GET YOUR GRUB ON!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SPOT!!!!

I was told about this place about a year ago, but I didn't actually visit until I was being carted around by a Latina friend and we ended up here about a week ago.  I've been back twice since  the Al Pastor is to-die-for. This huge slab of meat, get this - crowned with a pineapple -, is on a vertical spit being continuously roasted and sliced from. The result is juicy, flavorful, and seared perfection. The cilantro sauce is a great compliment, although you can opt out of you want to taste the meat more clearly.  8 tacos and 2 drinks ran us under $20, which is a steal in my opinion. I ate 5 and she had 3. We were both sufficiently stuffed. The carne asada didn't wow me as much, but I think it may have just been overshadowed by the Al Pastor   Do yourself a favor and check this place out next time you're in the area. Just be prepared to wait if you come around lunch, and especially dinner time.",

I fought my husbands patience here all the way to the front of the line but it was worth it! He was even dumbfounded by the greatness of the taco! It's scary to see the meat being sliced but I admire their work flow system. The tacos are like swallowing heaven! I want to go back to Vegas to just eat here!",

I ordered 6 tacos and she charged me for 9. Not only that, she charged me for the most expensive tacos. Thank God I checked my receipt. So when I brought it to their attention, the lady tells me that she can only give me more tacos, and she can't give me my money back. Somebody done told her wrong. I demanded to see the Mgr. And she changed her tune and brought me what she said was my money due. CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS PEOPLE.",

Not sure why but there was a very long line for Carne Asada... cmon guyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyys, I noticed there was no line at all for one of the Al Pastor lines, so Security asked us which one of us wanted Al pastor and we all got to cut into that line, sweeeet!  Ordered 6 Al Pastor tacos and had no regrets. My friends waited probably another 30 minutes for Carne Asada. Ideally, you'd want to just split your group into the lines and order for the entire group, but thankfully I didn't waste any time desiring any Carne Asada. Surprisingly, 6 tacos was not enough for me... Now I'm kind of craving some more at this moment.",

I am a big fan of authentic mexican tacos made from the cuts of meat you do not get everywhere.  The sudero and cabeza tacos were fantastic.  The meat was good even with the little bits of fat.  The campenchana fries were also well worth the money.  You can find fancier americanized mexican food in Las Vegas but this is the real deal.   Tacos run about the $2 a piece and the meat covered fries run about $10 for a large order.   It gets busy in this place but there is a reason for that.  I cannot wait to go back on my next trip.",

The small but comfortable outdoor patio was perfect for the sunny day. We only wish we had gone sooner, not on our last day before heading home!

It has that dense flavor that can only allow for a couple.  Mix the Tripa taco with a nice Al Pastor and Carne Asada and you're good to go.  All the tacos here pack some real flavor, and to me is considered the closest thing to really good Mexican food in all of Las Vegas.   There is a good size indoor eating area, and a better sized outdoor eating area, and a big enough parking lot off the strip.  So it's actually easy to get up in this place and have some good ol' cheap but really awesome tacos!",

    "text": "Living in Arizona for several years, I have been to a fair amount of taco shops. But I have never been to one like this. The moment my boyfriend and I walked in the door we knew we were in for something unique.  We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.  The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while.   Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement. Seriously some of the best tacos I've ever had.   Next time I find myself in Vegas this will be at the top of my to-do list.",

I love the Asada Quesadillas with everything on them. The Asada is much saltier than I would prefer but adding lime helps cut through it.   El Gordo reminds me of getting street tacos in TJ or Baja when I was in high school. It's authentic and a couple years ago it would be a 4 star but the novelty of remembering my many trips to Mexico is starting to depreciate and the meat is tasting saltier than I remember.   Overall if you want the real deal stop in and remember they have different lines depending on the type of meat you want so don't be the guy who stands around because he can't figure it out.",

    "text": "Alright alright - who's this hater giving Tacos El Gordo 3 stars? I mean, it averages 4.5 stars over 1100 reviews - so who's this guy giving it 3?  Yes - it is a cheap eat in Vegas. Yes - there are great tacos here. Yes - there is quite an assortment of meats here. Yes - they're pretty quick Yes - everyone and their moms eat here because of everything that everybody raves about.  But.. I just didn't think it was THAT great. My wife loved it - in fact, we ate here twice during the 2-day stay we had in Vegas. I guess I've just been spoiled with the availability of great tacos at a cheaper price in LA, that I didn't see what the hoopla of Tacos El Gordo is/was.  It's a solid option, especially if you're up drinking, partying, clubbing, or doing whatever else Vegas has to offer, and it's late, and you want something to eat. They're great at what they do, I just didn't think it was as amazing as it was overhyped to be.  I got the buche, the cabeza, and the lengua tacos. Each taco had a lot of meat. The lady had an asada vampiro. She was satisfied with her choice.   She did make the remark that everything about Tacos el Gordo was legitimately Mexican i.e. the layout, staff, products, and even the patrons [all walks of life] - just that the price wasn't quite Mexican, meaning, you're paying more for the same product. I guess the price was the biggest turn off for me, since there are $1 taco places near my childhood home that offer the same quality goodness that is a taco.  Was it good? Yes. Great? Mmmmm.....",

The ordering is a little confusing and one needs to be assertive to get the attention of an expediter.  The only thing that is sadly disappointing is the hot sauce.  They put a a couple of tablespoons on each taco, but if that doesn't suffice then you ask for more at the register.  The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served. Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.   It is in a mexi part of Vegas which is good.  I would return but am still on the hunt for more Mexi-Vegas places.",

I recommend getting the fries ONLY when it's not super busy or if you don't mind waiting 15+ minutes. A large order of fries can easily feed two regular-sized adults, so you might want to opt for a small if you're going solo. You can wait for your tacos here (also ask for some grilled green onions and peppers to eat with your tacos!!) and then move to the opposite side of the kitchen to pick up the fries, which takes some time to prepare as they keep getting bombarded with an endless stream of orders. The fries are definitely worth the wait though!",

Lines were LONG; they went out the door slightly, and a security guard let you in as the lines moved.  This was on a Sunday afternoon.  It was confusing that there were two lines for adobada surrounding one line for carne asada, and it seemed that there were two flavors on the sign.  We went to order adobada and I cannot remember what wording was below it on the sign, and it turned out they were the same type.  We tried it one year ago, and all I got were clumps of fat in my soft tacos that turned me off.  There was hardly any solid meat in the carne asada.  However, this time it was a different, positive experience.  Definitely want to come back every time we are in Vegas.  It's just that now we know how to strategize and stand in two lines to order.",

Be prepared to wait at least another 15 min once you get inside in the unbearable heat of this establishment. If you want multiple types of meat, I warn you to bring multiple people with you because you have to stand in seperate lines, depending on what you want. In other words, if there is only 1 of you coming and want multiple meats, be advised and prepared to have to get in 1 long line, then wait in another long line. All it is is a waiting game here. If that isn't enough, you have to wait in an additional line to pay once you receive your food. In the end, you will be eating and half of your food will be cold. What they offer is outstanding but the whole structure of this establishment is not worth it for me. Sadly, I was excited about this place but i will not be returning!",

    "text": "I've heard about Tacos El Gordo as their main branches are in south San Diego and they are WELL known for authentic Mexican street tacos. These aren't just *any* run of the mill chicken/steak/carnitas tacos but the REAL ones where they use certain... innards of the animal. Although I've lived in Chula Vista for so long I hadn't visited one (shame on me), so not only am I able to complete a pilgrimage to such a well-known taco establishment before I move to the Bay Area, I also got to introduce the No1DP to REAL tacos. It's a step up from the \"Mexican\" food he's been used to eating on his business trips but he says it was way too late to try brain and stomach tacos :/  This is one of the few places in Vegas that are open quite late on a weekday (3am) and even more late on weekends (5am). Frankly there's not much that's open for late night eating afterwards unless you are willing to go off-strip and even then you have to know what you are looking for. This area is also short walking distance from the Wynn/Encore hotel group so this would be a perfect late-night spot for people getting out of XS/Surrender/Tryst and needing to sober up.  There's indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is covered. No1DP says that outside is a good place to go people-watching as it overlooks Las Vegas Blvd.  Inside the taco shop there are various counters. Each counter you can order specific items. Place your order then fall in line at cashier towards the door to pay.  All tacos use two flour tortillas to soak up the fat/give stability to the taco plus each taco has a generous portion of salsa verde. There's no cheese or sour cream on the taco (which is a sign of a True Mexican taco joint). Each taco is between $2-$3.  Asada: Typical beef carne asada taco. Tastes like any other carne asada taco. If you live in SoCal and are lucky enough to have taco shops within reasonable driving distance, just do yourself a favor, be more adventurous and try a taco that you'll only find here. Suadero (shoulder): One of the best cuts of meat for a taco I've ever had. Shoulder seems like it was braised as the meat was quite soft and juicy without it being too greasy. Cabeza (head): For this taco I think they grind up the head so that the end result texture is similar to a pate. The taste was a bit weird and didn't have much flavor as a meat; it absorbed more of the oil and the salsa verde.   I can definitely justify the hype regarding this place and this taco joint, along with TJ's Oyster Bar for tacos from the sea, are my two recommended taco joints for REAL street tacos. Now if I can find someone to drag along who is willing to try beef brain, tripe and pork stomach before I leave...",

    "text": "After going here once, this place has easily become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. My friends and I came here once for lunch after a night at EDC since it was a short walk from Circus Circus.  We arrived at about 2:30pm and the lines were out the door. There were multiple lines: one for carne asada (beef), one for adobada (spicy pork) and one for lengua (beef tongue) + everything else. My friends and I all split into different lines. The adobada and carne asada line took ~45 mintues to order, whereas the lengua line didn't even take 15.  I ended up asking my friends to get me something from each line.  Carne Asada Fries ($10): The beef itself was really good. Super tender and just absolutely melts in your mouth. The fries, on the other hand, were nothing special. The fries comes with cheese, sour cream and guacamole (although I don't think we got the guac.)  Adobada Taco ($2) and Quesadilla ($4): Easily my favorite. Definitely worth the wait for this. The spicy pork was probably the best I've ever tasted at any Mexican restaurant. It was the right amount of spicy and OMG was it juicy.  Lengua Taco ($2.25): The lengua here is a really close second to the adobada. The meat is super juicy (like all the others lol) and there is a lot of flavor.  Pork Shoulder Taco ($2): My least favorite out of all the meats, but still really good. It's basically like pulled pork, I would say. There isn't as much flavor in this compared to the other meats, but still, the meat melts in your mouth.  Even though waits can be long, I would absolutely come back here. It's SO cheap for the amount that they give you.  Notes: - They give a lot of toppings on EVERYTHING. - You order the food at the counter and then pay at the registers by the door. Kinda awkward when there's hella people in line and you're just trying to get through to pay. - Open super late Fridays and Saturdays.",

    "text": "BEST. TACOS. OF. MY. LIFE. And the crazy part is-I don't even like tacos normally! So glad we found this place: it's on the strip in between the Wynn / Encore and the Stratosphere (closer to the Encore). There was a crazy line when we got there but it was well worth it! The inside is kind of a diner style place with plenty of seating (but you might have to wait to get some if there are a lot of people). They have multiple lines depending on which tacos you want to try. I opted for the spicy pork (adobada) and beef tongue (lengua). Both were DELICIOUS. They shave the spicy pork straight from this tower of meat (imagine shawarma style) and every bite is juicy and delectable. The beef tongue is surprisingly soft. They also put a salsa that gives it a real kick on the tacos, so be prepared for that! To top it all off, this place is also crazily cheap. Each taco is $2.10 so you literally see people grabbing a whole tray of them. For me 3 was plenty for lunch.   My only regret is that when I crave these there's no way to get them except for to get back to Vegas, but guess having to return isn't the worst thing in the world!",

We waited inside for another 20 minutes to order and retrieve our food.  But my goodness.  I've had lengua and cabeza elsewhere, but this place tasted much better for some reason.  The lengua was fresh..they took it from the boiling pot and sliced it up right in front of us.  The taste was unreal..so fresh, so steamy, and so greasy in a good way.  The cabeza was the best I've ever had.  I'll be back!",

Luckily, we came in during off-peak time, 3 in the afternoon, and were able to try the spicy pork, and a few others.  I liked the sopes the best because of the gooey layer of cheese.  Yum!  Some of the meats weren't as flavourful as I had hoped so we slathered on some spicy salsa which still wasn't all that spicy.  Go figure.  All in all, it was a pretty good snack and for the price, worth the trek.    That pineapple-coconut drink was so good!  Pina Colada.  Double yum!  3.5 stars, but rounding up to 4.

To start, the lines are confusing and chaotic!The tacos, were made inconsistent, some had not enough meat some had no guacamole some had one tortilla and some had two. The meat, was dry with no taste.   The price at $2.00 a taco off the street should be a Very Good taco, this is not even close, its more of a $1.00 taco!  So many other places are much better. I don't get it.",

    "text": "i came here for lunch today after checking out from Aria and it was my first time, but it was so good. I wasn't even hungry but still managed to scarf down two tacos. The guy slicing our meat was super friendly and nice... that made me love the place even more.   I asked my bf to get me foil so i could save my last taco for the car ride home. While I was attempting to wrap it, one of the lady's that worked there came by and helped me, but because I'm dumb I thought the shiny side of the foil was suppose to be covered... apparently I'm wrong! She took my tacos and had the guy wrap it for me.   that's what i call customer service, and it left me with a smile. i hope they read my review and know that I really appreciate great customer service. I never asked for help but she passed by and just helped me... like so motherly!!  come here, you won't regret it!! the workers all looked so happy and really nice. in LA a lot of taco establishments are kind of nerve wrecking to walk in especially some of the king taco's I've been to.",

It's like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi.  You have to know what line to get into for which type of food.  One line for asada, one for spicy pork and a line for the rest.  So, if you want one of each, you need to get into three lines.   I had 4 spicy pork tacos. The meat is on the spindle like gyro meat.  It's got good flavor and they give you a lot of meat on two small street taco tortillas. They also have some homemade sauces and garnishes that make them really good.  I think they make the tortillas on the premise because I see them making them, but I can't be sure the ones I ate were from that same process.  I can't see them making every tortilla because they sell a bunch.  There is some seating indoors and a lot of table outdoors under a canopy.  I don't think I would make a special trip to eat these. I would wait in line if I happened to be the area.",

Unfortunately, they are no longer on the strip due to parking issues with the other businesses. The tortillas are great tasting, however, the meats were very disappointing. We bit into several \"chewy\" pieces. My husband order 3 alpastor tacos and I ordered 3 asada tacos and we shared a large asada fries. My husband disliked his alpastor tacos because he said it was flavorless and they tried to covering it by drowning it with chile. All the asada tacos and fries had chewy pieces. We  ate only 1/4 of our asada fries. The meat was so full of oil that I was not able to taste the seasoning. I use to recommend this place to people before their vegas trip, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it anymore. The new place to eat in Vegas for us is SkinnyFAT.",

Although this time, since I came close to closing time, they missed the Guac and regular cheese they use and used shredded cheese for my carne asada fries (I had to get because they ran out of the adobada fries) I have to give them a 5 star review JUST for the guy who was serving the tacos alone with all the people waiting in his line. Adrian!! That guy deserves either a raise or promotion. He filled an order of 30 tacos in under 2 minutes! He's so fast and was able to get to us crazy fast! I even asked the lovely cashiers at check out for his name just to write this and they joked around with me and were super friendly and funny! Ambience is great! If you come in late and this guy is working, you won't have to wait long for your order. Thanks Adrian!",

The al pastor meat was delicious, and I love how they put sliced pineapples on their tacos it was the perfect combination.  Their Grilled green onions and chilles were good too! Everything here was fresh and made to order.  Even their tortillas were made from scratch.  Another plus about this joint was unlimited refills of horchata.  the drinks were only $1.40 the Al pastor tacos were only $2.00, the Suadero tostada was $2.00 and the Suadero Quesedilla was $4.00.     We left Tacos El Gordo full and satisfied.  We will be coming back our next visit to vegas.  This place is amazing and service is quick and friendly.",

Admittedly, I had them for the first time, exactly 13 hours ago. I fell in love with these tacos. Hard and quick. I'm pretty sure I fell in love with it even before I ate. Probably fell in love when I got our of my car, and could already smell the food.   The adobada tacos were amazing. We also ordered the carne asada fries, bu half carne asada & half adobada. The carne asada had good flavor, but was burnt. I don't know if I would order the carne asada again.   The line on the right is to order pork, the line on the left is to order everything else.   I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas, but Tacos El Gordo has changed my mind about it. Definitely get the pineapple on your tacos. I'm not a big fan of fruit on my food, but i just adds another great element to these tacos. It also has this green sauce on it, of which I am not sure what it is, but it's good. Each taco has plenty of meat, so be prepared to get full.   Just a tip - grab plenty of napkins. As good as the tacos are, it gets very messy when you eat them. Plenty of oil and sauce will be dripping down your hand, and probably down your arm as well - so be sure to roll up your sleeves.",

So I ordered one beef taco for $2 and one beef burrito for $4. Next I saw the portion. The burrito wasn't a \"burrito\" I am used to eating. So I was a little confused. And I thought the portion was so small. Once again, not what I am used to. So sadness came over me. I sat down to eat my meal. OMG, these people know how to make tasty Mexican food! Pure joy and happiness began to take over any past emotions. The food was very tasty. And it turned out the portion wasn't small at all. I got full on just those two orders. The point is, this place is awesome! Sooo good! 4 stars instead of 5 because they don't give you utensils when dining in. I literally sat down and had to get up again to find the forks. And it was so crowded in there, getting the fork wasn't easy. I saw that most people were eating with their hands. But they should offer utensils during when the customer is up at the register paying for their meal. I don't mind eating with my hand but when I've been sightseeing all day, I know I do not want to touch my food with my dirty hands. Hence why they need to automatically offer utensils rather than assuming the customer will locate the utensils and take one.",

Immediately after my first bite my mouth was doing the happy dance. We ordered 4 pastor/adobada tacos and 3 carne asada both with everything which was salsa, onions, cilantro and guacamole salsa and let me tell you both were PHENOMENAL. I was in my own world of ecstasy while the lady next to me couldn't stop telling her husband that it's been so long since her food had that much flavor. I stood in the al pastor line while my fiance was in the asada line and I was done ordering in 1 minute and then he let us also get the carne asada tacos thru him so she didn't have to stay in line.

She has no clue, no customers there is no need for her.....this kind of service will eventually get them a bad rating  if they don't change that attitude  and end the hype....  Management great time to monitor your team and make the adjustments needed.",

They have a large variety of meats, the only downside that is important to note is that you have to make separate lines for each type of meat. Worst idea ever, so bring friends and tag team those lines. I will give them kudos for having security and keeping the lines in order. The quality of meat is ok but very well marinated. They have a grilled onion station which you also have to line up for and they have some tables to sit at. This place is a must after the club but bring a lot of patience with you if you want asada tacos, that line is usually an hour.",

    "text": "The logistics of this place are stupid and deserve a 1 star, but the food is 5 stars all the way! My San Diego family has got me hooked on Tacos El Gordo.. I can only get it when I visit them.  You can imagine my surprise and happiness to find they have a location in Vegas! I sure did walk 20 minutes from my hotel in the scorching hot to eat me some adobada and asada tacos. By the time we got there, we were so ready. Then to our dismay, we opened the door to find the line up to the door, almost out the door. Darn! So we got in the line that looked shortest and waited. And waited more. As we got closer, our hearts sank.  We noticed that there were separate lines depending on types of meat.  I wanted asada and adobada, which meant I had to stand in line twice! Then if you want a drink, it's a separate line. Fries? Separate line. LAME! I don't remember San Diego locations being so asinine! So we split up and got into the lines we needed and placed orders for each other. The lines were about 15 minutes each... so I can't imagine 1 person wanting to do the not so unusual act of ordering more than one thing..they'd be there all day! Oh and then there is a separate line to pay.  Basically, don't come here starving, because it'll be awhile before you eat. Not to mention the place is friggin packed, but that's only because it's so good.   But let me tell you, when you finally do get to eat, it'll be the best tacos you ever had. You'll probably overeat and not regret it. You'll wonder why you ever thought Taco Bell tacos were actually tacos.  I was definitely on my gordita status that day and it was well worth it.",

I think we inhaled those tacos within minute (granted, they're sized to be about two large bites).   Great way to end a great night out, or in the words of Lil'John, YEEAAAYYYUUHHH.",

A bit more than your average taco shop but then again this is technically on the Strip.   One thing to keep in mind, which can be a major annoyance if you want different items is that you can only order certain meats in certain lines. So if you want Carne Asada and Al Pastor, you have to get in one line for the Asada, and then another line for the Al pastor. If you're with someone, then split up and have everyone order something different. The line was long, moved slow, but overall the food was great. I'd definitely go back if the lines were shorter and if they moved a bit quicker.   Place gets packed so not much seating. We called a Lyft and took ours back to the hotel. Would definitely go back if we are on that side of the strip.",

We stood in the asada line for about a half hour before we got to place our order - 4 asada tacos, 1 sopes, 1 mulas. Almost everything is made fresh right in front of your eyes - the corn tortillas are scraped from a bowl of their dough, placed one at a time in the tortilla shaper and then put right on the flat grill; the raw beef is torn into smaller pieces, grilled fresh and chopped quickly. It's the freshness that makes everything you eat so delicious - the meat is succulent and tender, the toppings are complex and pack a great punch next to the creamy textured tortillas, and the cheese on the sopes and mulas tastes a bit indulgent.   I cannot recommend this place enough.",

Something you will have to wait a long time in to get tacos that aren't that special. Don't get me wrong they are delicious. I just think that the lines should be more organized. The amount one person can order should be limited. The service by the staff needs to improve so much. Getting anything that is not tacos(like fries) is a horrible experience. Parking is horrible. I would say if you really want Tacos El gordo go to another tacos el gordo location or better yet another taco spot. Its not worth it. Asada fries were good.

Buche and tripa are my 2nd and 3rd favorite taco meat so of course I'm going to say that TeG's is amazing.   Thanks for reading my review! I hope by now you're on your way to taco heaven!!",

Make sure to double up on the limes and radishes!  Our Lyft driver insisted that we go because it was so good and he even waited for us! I wish we had one in Atlanta!!

We had a group of 3 and each person stood in a different line. The one waiting in the asada line didn't get their tacos until like 10 minutes after the other two finished eating. We had to eat outside because there was no indoor seating. Eating in 100 degree weather is not fun.   The good part was that we highly enjoyed our meal. I had a tongue, head, shoulder and asada.  I liked the asada and shoulder best out of those. I also tasted the adoboda and chorizo. All three of us were pretty happy with our tacos.   I give 4 stars bc of the wait and the fact we had to eat outside dripping in sweat. The food, though, was great. It's also fun watching the guys make the tacos right in front of you.",

They are like authentic street tacos you get on the side of the street in taco carts but they make sure they fill up the meat and sauces without being stingy on it. Definitely worth a stop.

    "text": "SECURITY GUARD AT DOOR HAD THE WORST ATTITUDE!!!! So I went a couple weeks ago & started out by sitting at a table which I had to wait for while my husband was standing in line. Security had told me I couldn't drink my alcoholic beverage on property which I understood & didn't have any complaints even tho there were others drinking near me on the tables but I didn't say anything,  the security guard then started giving attitude to the people in front of my husband by putting her hand up as in motion to stop & said in a rude voice \"You know which line your going in?, cause you know there are different lines & I need to know that you know where your going!\" When they were confused she smirked and said \"ya there's different lines & you don't know where your going!\".... This girl straight up thought she was a cop! Anyways it was our turn & before she said anything my husband said \"just letting you know,  there are other people drinking on the tables not fair you singled out my wife!\" She replied \"one problem at time!\" With again her hand up in a stop motion... I told him just let it go... anyways, with an attitude she told us which lines we needed to go in since we wanted different meats & I have never heard of such a thing so to make sure I understood her I asked \"so we need to go in 2 different lines cause we want different meats?\" She replied \"ya you guys are making it hard cause you guys want different meats!\" I said \"No! You guys are making it hard by making so many different lines!\" You should really work on your people skills cause you have an attitude!\" She responded laughing & said \"really??? This is the 1st time I've heard someone tell me that! I said \"I find that hard to believe!, you need to remember your not a real cop your just a rent a cop!\" She responded by saying \"how do you know i'm not a real cop!\" I said \"well if you were then you are abusing your authority which you just want me to think you are to scare me\" then she turned & said something under her breath which I didn't hear but my husband did & she said \"that's what happens when you drink too much!\" Which btw I was no where near drunk! Lol if I was I would have had no self control & she would have been on the floor!!! Anyways my husband said let's go after he heard what she said & he told me after we left what she said cause he knows there would have been problems! Lol so sad to say I didn't even eat here cause security guard chased us away,  other customers saw when I walked out & was like don't let her chase you away just ignore her but no! I'm not going to spend my money where there are people that hate their job & need an attitude adjustment!!!! SHE IS CLEARLY tired of explaining the situation of the lines & it is clear THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT JOB FOR HER! She needs to be fired!!!.... I would give it another try if I didn't see her at the front door!!",

The restaurant is bright and clean and full of friendly staff.   The ordering is a bit confusing because when you walk in your not too sure where to order, so I can see how it can get a little chaotic when it's busy. Luckily we were there a little early so no lines. You order first than pay at a separate station.   We went with some spicy pork tacos and the carne asada tacos. The spicy pork tacos were amazing!! You can see the pork rotating and being carved fresh by the counter. The asada was nice and smoky but a little dry and the texture was off. We also got some spicy pork fries it was huge and pretty filling. Opt for the small if its just you and your boo, comes in large which could easily feed 4. The tacos come with salsa and sides of pepper and onion. You can ask for more salsa if you want.   The prices were great and the food was excellent, will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place is a MUST when I come to Vegas. Who can say no to delicious, affordable tacos that are available at all the right hours? Perfect for late night bites as well as mid-day snacks/lunch/indulgence.  I've tried a good variety, but my favorites are still Beef Tongue and Spicy Pork. Beef shoulder is good, but a little tough and not as tender as the tongue. Brain is an interesting choice, but only if you are a foodie wanting to try new things. My least favorite so far is the tripe - don't get me wrong, I love eating tripe, but this just wasn't the way I liked it. It just tasted too organ-y if that makes any sense.  The food in quesadilla form is also pretty tasty... Ahh my stomach GROWLS as I am typing this!",

    "text": "Want real Mexican tacos hundreds of miles from the borders?  Want them at almost any hour?  Tacos El Gordo is as legit as they come for \"Tijuana style\" tacos.  After a 15 minute wait and $120 later, eight (8) of us had probably our best Vegas meal at 5:00AM after a night of wayyyyyy too much alcohol.  We had tacos de carne asada, adobada and my personal favorite...mulas.  They were all fantastic, and while the prices are a little high, you are on the strip and they are open until the wee hours of the morning.  I would gladly pay $3 a taco for carne asada deliciousness at those hours.   I will say that the San Diego locations have disappointed me the past couple times I have been there, but this one hit the spot in so many good ways.  I will come back again and again, as any Vegas weekend with tacos in the morning hours is always a good night!",

    "text": "Quick eats with generous portions on any hour at a price that's affordable which even makes you crave for more, this place fits the bill!  A place that stays open into the wee morning hours located on \"The Strip\" along the Riviera Resort and Wynn Resort side of the street. Security guards are a common sight, for added feeling of secureness while you eat. Sit out in the outdoor canopied patio on chairs or on the cushioned seating. It sure will satisfy your stomach's need for Mexican cuisine of tacos. At a price of two dollars, five bucks to ten bucks a meal, fill up with all the fixings that goes with the taco you order which is best but, u must ask for it (at no extra charge) are: onions, spicy pepper, guacomole sauce, cilantro, sour cream, cheese, jalapeno, grilled scallion/onion, guacomole (mashed avocado), and even pineapple chunks. The food servers will add it to your order. After receiving your order, you should go to the side dish server and add up with the salsa (green or red pepper sauce), chopped horseradish, chopped onions, slices of lime as you please for yourself.   My Favorite meals is: Taco Al Pastor (\"Al Pastor\" in Spanish means, in the style of the shepherd. It is a dish of Central Mexico in an adoption of the spit-grilled meat or pork marinated over one or two days with dried chiles, and pineapple as meat tenderizer, thus cooked slowly with gas flame on a vertical rotisserie called a \"trompo\" which is literally, a spinning top). The vertical rotisserie of pork is an obvious sight and to see the server take cuts or slices of pork from the spit griller.  My favorite is the Vampiro (means vampire). This succulent super taco of chile quesadilla wrapped around juicy grilled carne asada (steak) fabulously good meal sounds like an immortality. My vision of it is a steak through its heart; as in a stick through a vampire's heart. Okay, this brings a smile to heart (love) a vampire.  Other favorites: Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), Taco de Carne Asada (steak), Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder), Tacos de Lengua (beef tongue), Adobada (red chili-garlic) Fries. But you must try the Taco de Tripa (tripe), Taco de Lengua (tongue), Tacos de Cabeza (beef head), Tacos de Sesos (beef brain), Tacos de Buche (pork stomach) which are exotic fare to munch on. For first-timers, dare it, is delicious! One bebida or drink favorite is the Horchata (a Mexican rice and cinnamon milk-like drink). Other dish on the menu are Quesadilla (a flour tortilla or a corn tortilla filled with a savory mixture containing cheese, other ingredients, and/or vegetables, then folded in half to form a half-moon shape) with meat, Sopes (soup) with meat, Tostadas (meaning \"toasted\" is a Mexican fried tortilla), Mulas (shredded beef on tortilla with cheese and salad), Carne Asada (steak) Fries, Campechana (seafood) Fries, Taco Azteca (or Nopal Asado, is grilled cactus).  Just have patience as you wait in line to get the servers to take your order. With a price and generous portion like it is, you are not the only one lining up for these eats. The strong scent of food that permeates the air is enough to keep you staying in line. Betcha some of the people in line are in it for more. Visiting and eating during early morning hours is quite a feast from one taco to the next. Although any time of the night or day will do. Mexican cuisine at its simple fare doesn't get any better than this! More!",

Been coming here forever and if you think Benihana and all you can eat Brazilian steak is culture, you need to get your gordo   trasero ( fat butt) down to the TEG! You'll feel  like you died and went to Mexico, only they speak english and are not trying to rip you off, just feed you most authentic taco you will find in Nevada. All at the taco  $ 2  store- simple menu, all for one low price, how nice is that? The 5 stars are for bein' real, the food is more like  a 4. This place is seriously off the hook, as far as a basic taco joint goes. What you see is what you get, BYOB as well. The menu consist of essentially 2 things, meat and meat. Pork in a few versions , the Abodaba is killer,nothing like it anywhere I've eaten- plus the usual body parts cabeza ( brain) lengua ( tongue)  Buche  ( pork stomach) and asada, you can top off your asada with some silky nopal (cactus) all wrapped in their handmade tortillas.Tacos are very simple  meat, onions, guac, hot sauce and a white sauce I can't place that smooths the whole thing over sprinkled with a little cilantro. No beans at all. Be sure to try the different windows, one for pork the other beef. It's a bit of a pain, especially if busy, tag team it with  pals if so. The attire and clientele   is all over the map ...tattooed chicas in heels and sparkle, hombres with cowboy boots, families with kids, dates, teens on skateboards, toasted college and other kids in town, locals and outta town tourista latinos of every sort..it's all here, under the red tent out front, sitting down at the stainless steel booths. Self serve order at the window, get your grub and pay before leaving. Right on the strip, next to the entrance to the Encore. Step right up amigo.",

The place's no-frills menu is the first thing through the door, with tacos being its shining star, offering choices including adobada, carne asada, cabeza for two bucks a pop. There are other items like quesadillas, mulas, and carne asada fries, but you can't go wrong with tacos.   Ordering can be a little tough if it's been a few years since you last sang \"La Camisa Negra\" by Juanes in high school, but the language barrier is minimal. There are several service stations and you can see them slapping on the ingredients in front of your very eyes so you know the STUFF BE FRESH.   \"Me encantan!\"",

The line extends outside so you have to stand in the suffocating heat, and then inside they split you off into different lines depending on what meat you want {carne aside, adobada, etc}. This is annoying because if you want different types of meat you have to wait in multiple long lines and go through the whole process all over again. THEN you have to get into yet another line to pay for your food at the cash register.  ~seating was also crowded and unorganized. It's just a few long lines of unseparated tables, so you're literally elbow to elbow with a random person eating next to you.",

Make sure you also get their fries because those are also phenomenal. I go here every time I'm in Vegas and will continue to go!",

You're in Vegas anyways so what's the surprise after waiting to get in the night/day clubs.  MENU My absolute favorite is the Adobada Taco topped with a small slice of pineapple! This is comparable to Leo's Tacos in Los Angeles which I also love so much. They have a fountain station dedicated for their different horchata but they are a little too sweet for me.  SERVICE Mediocre service at best because it's so busy! We had to ask for the extra pineapple on the tacos, otherwise they would forget or skip it.   I did meet a Mexican couple who was visiting from Florida and they shared their tradition of always stopping by for these tacos when they are in town because they were comparable to the ones in Mexico.

However, during this last trip I was prepared, we made sure to go before we got super hungry, so by the time we got our food, it would be perfect timing. I love that they have different lines for different types of meats. While this saves time for some, it makes the wait longer for others. For example, the carne asada line was extremely long, while the adobada line was like 1/3 in length. For me personally I love all kinds of tacos, so it wasn't a deal break to go into the shorter line. I ordered a few tacos and a mula, which was super amazing. During my 2nd visit, the carne asada line was shorter, so that's where I went. I would say besides the long wait, the Tijuana style tacos are good,  will definitely be back.",

This location is the one on Las Vegas Blvd near Encore.  You sometimes ask yourself  aren't all tacos alike? The answer is NO!  Tacos El Gordo or as we call them tacos el fatty have turned a simple taco into some deliciousness in every bite.  Let start with the carne asada tacos. They serve these tacos on a street tacos size corn tortilla as they should be!  The carne asada is cooked to perfection . I must admit I enjoy the carne asada taco but I would not say it's what they are known for, but the fresh guacamole and salsa in the tacos are great. However, my purpose in visiting TEG is Al Pastor! OMG if you eat nothing else please, please have the al pastor tacos with everything on them. We have many taco shops in Vegas but the al pastor tacos is by far the best I've had anywhere. That is locally in Vegas and worldwide! This is the best al pastor taco ever. It's a perfection of the meat being cooked shawarma style. They cut it fresh onto your yellow corn tortilla  and top it off with a green sauce ( know as the crack sauce) it's not spicy and adds to the perfection of the marinated al pastor pork and cilantro and onions. This is WOW in your mouth  they also serve cesos, tripa, buche.   So the only thing people sometimes get confused as they are not use to the Tijuana Taco stands model.  If you go iba group when you arrive send  one person to order the asada and another for al pastor tacos. This will speed up the experience and make it much smoother and on your way to enjoy your tacos.  You order from the different lines and then you go pay and sit and enjoy!",

The tacos were by far some of the best iv ever tasted I would recommend anyone who loves tacos to stop by and give this place a try it will be well worth it. The prices on everything were very reasonable also i will for sure make this a stop anytime i'm in Vegas!",

As someone who hasn't tried their SD location, I relied heavily on my friends who have. We waited around 40min in line for the food.   It's a bit confusing in the beginning because the line out is singular, but once you step inside, you'll only be able to wait in \"meat-specific\" lines. For example, a line for lengua & cabeza, a line for asada, and a line for el pastor. I think you're able to request a different meat in line, but it just makes waiting longer for you and everyone else in line.  Theyre pretty quick once you place your order because they only work on one order at a time. After you get your food, you'll have to pay for it and then go find a table.   My friends told me that this location was pretty salty and not as great as SD. You gotta factor in that this is Vegas and the lines get really long in the evenings so that might be the contributing factor for long lines, and bulk production of food (over-seasoning).  3 stars because it honestly wasn't worth the wait.",

We landed in Vegas late on a Thursday night and we were super hungry and ready to party. The friends we were traveling with told us they visited a taco place called Tacos El Gordo and that the tacos were bomb, well let me tell you something, if I had a taco for every time I hear that I would be living in Taco Land.  The system they have to order the food is super contra productive, they pretty much have a line for every kind of taco they have, so if you are by yourself and want to try 5 different tacos you are SOL. Luckily it was four of us so we were able to get our orders quick.  I got a taco of adobada, one quesadilla, an order of grilled cebollitas and chiles, a brain taco, my favorite, tongue taco, and a apple soda to wash down all this deliciousness. The prices are fair, but the portions are very reasonable, 1 taco is more like 2 lol. Also, I would like to mention they have a thing call Carne Asada fries, or Campechana fries, and even al pastor fries. I was so against to order that, but the wife being a fry lover,  went for it. I have to say, those fries are probably the greatest invention ever since the Iphone.  This venue is more than Chok approved, let's say from now on we should call La Catedral del Gordo",

The other salsa are in the fridge behind the registers so you need to ask them if you want any. Self-serve soft drinks.    I always get the adobada (spicy pork) and the asada (beef). Each tacos cost around $2.40 now. Everytime I go, the prices go up. I have also tried the lengua, the asada fries, and chorizo but my favorite is the adobada and asada. The tacos are then smothered with spicy salsa and onions and cilantro. If you get the asada, then they add guac on the top. It's a must when you visit Vegas! The lines are just really long when you go during peak hours like lunch and dinner and when everyones getting out of the club.",

    "text": "\"Best value\" meal on the strip, right here.  I live in San Diego, so I'm fortunate enough to reside within minutes of a Tacos El Gordo shop. Tacos El Gordo has been selling tacos for over 45 years, first based out of a few stores in Tijuana, and now with 3 locations in San Diego and 3 locations in Las Vegas. Near as I can tell, the quality of the tacos is identical at this location on the Las Vegas Strip as it is at the other shops I've been to.  Tacos El Gordo sells several types of tacos, but they're known for their \"Al Pastor\" tacos. The \"Al Pastor\" tacos feature juicy marinated pork that has developed a crispy outer crust that is then carved off of a vertical spit-grill into corn tortillas, then dressed with onions, cilantro, and a dreamy chipotle crema. These very well could be the tastiest thing you will eat on your trip to Las Vegas.  While you would think that such a place would thrill Americans visiting Las Vegas from around the country, many of whom would be tasting authentic Mexican tacos for the very first time, there are many loud detractors leaving Yelp reviews. While most of the reviews rating this place lower than 4 stars are due to the wait (it's a very busy place) or to complain that the $0.18 they paid for their taco was too expensive, there are more than a few that attack the quality or authenticity of the food here. It is those reviews I'd like to respond to:  \"I'm from southern California and have tasted authentic tacos these are not them. Yes the tortilla is made from hand that was the best part. The al pastor was fatty lacked flavor and were died pink to show more color.\" * Are you even reviewing the right place? For one, Tacos El Gordo does not make their tortillas by hand. Secondly, they carve the Al Pastor meat off of a rotating spit IN FRONT OF YOU, so I'm confused where in that process you're seeing them add dye to the meat.  \"Way better places to eat and visit in Vegas so don't waste your time here. And what kind of Mexican place doesn't have burritos???\" * \"Burrito,\" which literally translates to \"donkey\" in Spanish, is not even Mexican. And yet 2 stars. Yelp allowed you to give this place 2 stars. *sigh*  \"I recommend not to go here. For starters the line is toooooooo long and their idea of a quesadilla is a tortilla on the bottom, melted cheese and then meat. If you want good food I suggest going to Golden Nugget hotel and trying their restaurants.\" * Uhhh...  \"The quesadillas are basically a taco with cheese, (I didn't ask for a taco with cheese), yet that is what I received.\" * No, I assure you it's a quesadilla.  \"Waited in line for dried out meat. Don't order a quesadilla. Cuz it's not really a 'quesadilla' it's more like a tostada.\" * OK everybody, sorry that you were looking for a grilled cheese sandwich made with tortillas, yet asked for a quesadilla in an authentic Mexican restaurant, and was given an authentic quesadilla.  \"it's definitely a unique type of al pastor taco, interesting sauce but I prefer a more simple style.\" * If by \"unique\" you mean \"more similar to the way it is served in Mexico than whatever al pastor B.S. I've been eating in Bugtussle, Kentucky,\" I'll buy that.  \"I didn't like most of the food as it was a bit too authentic and not for my taste buds.\" * At least this guy was honest.  I've not included quotes from the chumps complaining about their tacos getting cold as they went to wait in a separate line after they got their initial taco order. I think these are the same people who have trouble tying their shoes as an adult.  My advice based on reading hundreds of Tacos El Gordo reviews this morning? Stick to the Al Pastor tacos unless you're particularly adventurous. Don't get anything involving French fries. Don't get the Carne Asada tacos -- I like them, but no one else does. If you come here drunk, expect to be confused by the line-up system used here. And stop being stupid on Yelp. I'm watching you.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.5/2.3/NA",

The lengua in the sope was delicious, although the thick corn tortilla (cake?) was a bit soggy compared to the ones from the SD Tacos el Gordo. The adobada taco was as good as I remembered, and the sauce is on point. They're much less generous on giving you slices of pineapple upon request, unfortunately :(  Pretty damn good overall if you're missing TJ style tacos and an affordable stop for lunch!",

The line was out the door and down the sidewalk. It does take a long time to finally order your food. There are different lines based on what type of meats/food you are ordering.   **tip** if you are with other people split up to different lines and have them order for you. (Example: 1 person stands in the carne asada line and orders for everyone, 1 person in the Adobada line and orders for everyone. Etc...)the cooks will hand you your order and then you pay at a register across the room, so everything works out and you save time.   They have dining room seating and outside seating, but for the most part all of the inside seating was taken and it was too cold to sit outside so we opted to just get everything to go and eat in our hotel room.   This place will definitely satisfy that street taco craving but it will come with a trade off for your time. I say it's worth it, but order in abundance as you do NOT want to have to get in line again.",

We showed up at 1am and it wasn't busy and I immediately went to order my tacos told my family stand in a line tell them what you want. WE spread out from the beef and pork line and man were we so happy we were there!  The meat was so tender and juicy always made perfectly, Tacos were hot and made so quickly!  We scarfed those tacos down so quickly I had to go and get seconds.   This is your taco spot when you come to vegas!  Wish they had one in texas!",

Coming from SoCal I am bias but these tacos are really really good (Can be salty...but when you're buzzed its darn good)!   The line is CONFUSING. like.. REALLY CONFUSING. I think thats probably the main reason why I knocked down a star. There is no regulation and people will cut in front of you.. like no joke. There are separate lines for different meats so if you want two types of meat you have to stand in two different lines.. which is a downer.  After getting the food you go into ANOTHER line to pay for the food which is much faster. I feel like people can get away with not paying bc no one really regulates you which is kind crazy. Of course, we always paid but its pretty chaotic at certain times.   Food: Honestly, the meat overall is really tender and tasty. Everything is pretty fresh bc they are constantly cooking new meat in front of you. The fries are just OKAY but when you're drunk you need them carbs so its always bomb. I dont have any major complaints regarding the food itself. I think it's a solid 4/5.   Overall i think this is going to still be a place for our buzzed munchies and I think that it is pretty solid hence the long lines and everyone willing to wait. FAN for sure!",

We each ordered a quesadilla and shared an order of carne asada fries. The quesadilla was literally not a quesadilla at all, but rather an overstuffed soft taco with another soft taco on top. Small AF and lacked the cheese pull goodness you'd normally expect from a quesadilla. The carne asada fries were even worse as the cheese wasn't even melted at all. Cold, hard cheese on fries. It was a mess.  The only real positive about this place was that despite being busy, the food came out relatively quickly. However, I can say with confidence that I won't be back.",

Take it off the menu.They need the health department to check it out and make sure it's avocado because if I didn't know avocado was delicious that would've ruined it for me. They shouldn't have the lime out in the open like that being that there are a lot of people and people can be dirty and disgusting. There's tastier Mexican restaurant with a shorter wait time.",

My first nite, I said I smelled tacos but had no idea this place was so close until I walked up to a Walgreen's that sits near the restaurant.   There are separate lines depending on what you are ordering, but the staff keeps it moving.   I must have had good vibes, cause the lines were not as long as some of the other reviews state, but after placing my order,  I was not surprised to see the lines forming behind me.   I had to request the peppers my first time, but my second and third time, they were handed to me with my tacos and tostados.  They don't have chicken, but several types of beef.  Each time I visited my food came up to $9.75, however I ordered something different each time.  Be sure to grab some of the fresh cut radishes and limes to accompany the food.  Gives it more flavor, but already very flavorful.",

I only ordered Al Pastor tacos due to the advice of the surrounding customers. The meat is sliced off in front of you and prepared with incredible speed. I don't mind the price because compared to the fine dining of most places in Vegas, it was incredibly cheap. I snagged horchata as my drink, and my coworker got this dried pumpkin snack thing (I think), and I loved it. I didn't even know I liked pumpkin.   You make friends in the line. Squirt a lime on your tacos, and check out the mini topping bar to spice it up further. You may or may not remember eating these amazing tacos, so do it again on your next night out~",

Honestly, sober or drunk, these tacos are OUTSTANDING. If you don't believe me, just look at the line. It's always out the door no matter what time of the day it is!  This location was on hiatus for a bit, but I'm glad it's back in full swing again. Its got its own charm that keeps reeling me in. Plus they're cheap, and for being on the Strip, that's kinda hard to find. Yeah, it might not be the fanciest eatery in town, but can you really turn down fresh tacos made right in front of you?!  My recommendation: Adobada tacos or carne asada fries. You can't go wrong with either choice.   Real recognize real with this place. Seriously worth it, imo.",

When I got there, she told me how to order and then to bring back my food and pay for it. Good, I got it! However, I ordered some tacos and while I was waiting in a table for the carne asada fries for my boyfriend, she again approached me to tell me that I had to go and pay for the food. I told her I was still waiting for my order and she said \" yes, I know but you still have to go and pay at front\" anyways, we got our carne asada fries wrong! Because we told the lady twice not to put sour cream on it and she did. We told her but we didn't wanted to wait another 15 minutes because my tacos were already cold. So, I stayed at the table and my boyfriend took the food to the cashier and paid. He came back to bring the food and left to grab some soda so I started eating and the cashier approached me for the third time to tell me that I had to pay for the tacos, I was so mad!!!! I didn't even looked at her but I told her that we already did, she demanded the receipt and I told her that I didn't have it because my boyfriend paid for them, and she asked me where he was!!!! So I told her, I was very uncomfortable and I didn't enjoyed my food at all. I left the place and while my boyfriend was looking for me he heard the cashier talking to the security about me! That I left without paying, until my boyfriend told her that I was with him. She didn't even apologize, she just said that is because a lot of people leave without paying. Awful customer service because you can't judge based on other people's bad behavior. Besides, if you're new to this place, there are three different lanes which are very confused due to the amount of clients allowed that over reaches it's maximum capacity! We got there at 11 am and got our food 45 minutes later! The food it's not worth the wait, if you're really hungry go somewhere else!",

    "text": "Reading about their carne asada fries is what brought us in here - my husband judges every taco shop/stand by their carne asada fries. We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork.   It is a bit confusing about how/where to order, seems like that problem could be solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!  We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it.   If I were to go back I would probably try some of the tacos, and also just order the fries with the spicy pork, I enjoyed that a lot more than the carne asada.",

I got the tongue, beef head, pork, and steak and I only felt the steak was really good. The other meats were well seasoned and cooked well, but I'm just not a big fan of the tortilla. It was a little too thick for me. Overall, this place is a good place to step away from all the expensive places on the strip, but just don't set your expectations too high.",

Everything had a lot of flavour.  The only thing was when we got here we were a little overwhelmed and a bit confused until the security guard instructed us that you have to order at different counters depending on what you want.  Then you have to go to the cashier and pay, kinda like cafeteria style.  Overall I highly recommend this place for any time of day.",

    "text": "My one regret from living in San Diego is that I didn't go to the original Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista more than once in the three and a half years that I lived there.  Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.  Same deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.  And since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!  I think I have an excuse to go to XS a lot more now.  When the joint is across the street from Encore Las Vegas, there's really not much choice.  Secret Pizza, you have met your post-clubbing food match!",

    "text": "Heard a lot about Tacos El Gordo and had been meaning to check it out. I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).  After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.  Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :)  Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did. It was hard to find a spot that wasn't dirty or taken so had to sit at the table by the bathroom. Needless to say, I ate my tacos and was out of there!",

And, to make it worse, the food ordering process once inside is completely lacking any assemblance of logical process.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out a much more efficient process for getting orders processed in a much quicker fashion.  Maybe somebody thought wasting peoples time was a good idea??  Never again will I waste my precious vacation time trying to get food here. On top of having to waste your precious vacation time, the portion sizes are ridiculously small, overpriced, and NOT anything special.  I've had a lot of tacos that were better.

I arrived here around 10 pm and there were TONS of people waiting in line to order. The place was pretty chaotic and it was pretty confusing at first knowing where to line up. I guess there were certain lines for each type of meat, but it really doesn't matter because the cooks all communicate with each other anyway.  So I had their lengua tacos, buche tacos, and their campechana (half carne asada/half lengua) fries and it was just heaven on a platter! Probably the priciest hole in the wall mexican joint I've been to, but the quality is there!  Don't forget to ask for the sauces at the checkout counter. I found that the fries were on the dry side and the sauces made a huge difference in the taste.   I would highly recommend anyone in Vegas to go here and try it out.

Not too spicy, the meat was juicy and savory ooh I'm making my mouth water. The lengua tacos were a little hot for me but the horchata is the perfect compliment to washing it all down. We also got the adobada fries which were topped with all the trimmings: guac, shredded cheese, sour cream, some really good green sauce, and of course adobada meat (spicy pork). I have a family of 6 and we were all fully satisfied. COME ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!!!  Also: the ordering process can be confusing for newcomers. Get in the line for the meat you want, order your tacos (or sopes, quesadillas, etc.), put your food on a tray, then walk over to the cashier to pay, and of course find a seat and enjoy!",

There was no drinking fountain in site and I had to ask three people for a cup of water, because I could feel that I was going to pass out. They said they were out and I asked if they had ANYTHING to put water in, a lid, a chip tray, and they said no, and refused me anything even though I told them I was going to pass out and saw a stack of cups behind the counter.   I found a chip tray and drank from the fountain drinks water tap. By then it was kind of too late.

The meats here are delicious and watching the cooks work their stations here is nothing short of impressive.  They are so freakin' fast! The food is really why you are here, and it doesn't disappoint.  The lengua is tasty, moist, and super tender. The al pastor is well seasoned and not too dry. The cabeza is delicious as well, give it a try.   The carne asada is really where it's at though. Unlike most taquerias, they actually grill the carne asada here. It has char!  It's not just steak on a hot top here.  It makes a huge difference.  Want to kick up the carne asada? Get the carne asada fries.  The fries are crisp and are the perfect complement to the savory goodness of the carne asada. Don't forget the real guacamole on top as well!  Oh yeah, did I mention the sauces? I have no idea what a lot of them are, but man, do they make the meats sing!!!    Everything is good here, even the marinated veggies that come on the side of the plate.

Went here on a Saturday night, and while it was busy, the service was quick, the food was fresh, and the taste was superb. Would I go back? Indeed I would, and I will.   I highly recommend the Pork Quesadilla, a little pricier than the $2 tacos at $4, but twice the size and twice the meat, well worth it. Not traditional though, it comes with cheese, grilled green onions (yum!), salsa (fresh and spicy, so gooooood), and  some sort of sour cream-ish type sauce (also awesome), and topped with a tostada shell (small, but a little extra crunchiness never hurt anyone). Everything is made right in front of you, including the corn tortillas. I had both carne asada and the spicy pork, both of them spectacular. Saw someone else eating the carne asada fries, and while $10 is a bit pricey, it's probably worth it given the portion size.   Looking forward to going back and getting more Gordo.",

Did I mention really good?  Ok, the lines....... If you go at peak time (pretty much any time they are open) you will see a huge line.  Facing the restaurant, the left side is pork, the middle is beef, the right side is fries with meat and other \"not taco\" stuff.  The register is in the middle of the chaos and you get your drinks there.  Good luck.  Bottom line - its worth the wait every once in a while to eat here.  Time to break out the granola bar you keep stashed in your glove box for food emergencies and get in line.  at least you won't get hangry waiting for almost 30-40 minutes to order your tacos.  You need to replace that granola bar every month or so anyway to keep it from getting stale.",

The manager of this place needs to be visited by Toyota to learn how to run their outfit efficiently. They need a person to take orders and ring people up. They need an POS system and electronic ordering screens going to people making the food in the back, who then prepare and organize the food for pick-up. What's going on here is a horribly inefficient, infuriating joke. You have to make a night out just to eat at this place, and believe me, it's not worth it. Wouldn't be worth it if every Food Network celebrity chef was working in the kitchen. If I were a local, I'd never be back, but hey, this is working for them now, milk it for all its worth, I guess. Nice gimmick, if it is what I think it is.",

Since all of them were from San Diego and that's where some of the best mexican food comes from but they were raving about Tacos El Gordo.   We got the adobada tacos, and abobada fries which I had no idea at first it was the marinate pork. It was absolutely delicious-nish. Probably the best taco I ever eaten before I love the sauce they use on the taco. It was good and very creamy. I like the number one fan of carne asada fries never having tried abobada fries but I gotta say they made a believer out of me. It was delicious and I love how much sauce it had. Yummy the definite mexican joint to hit in Vegas.",

Once you combat the line of indigenous personnel and finally get to order, go hard guys...go hard!  Our spread consisted of al pastor, tripas, lengua, & stomach....all of which are gracefully wrapped in freshly made tortillas that melt-in-yo-mouf!  I couldn't stop talking about these tacos even weeks after my virgin visit, but has since been a must have every time I visit Lost Wages.    Don't let the long lines discourage you, as a delicious reward will be awaiting at the end....oh did i mention they give you complementary grilled scallions and peppers?  And as much of it as you want!  Having said that, be sure to chase each taco bite with a slurp of grilled scallion \"noodles\" and a grilled pepper.....you've now discovered the best fucken tacos, prolly in the wasted state of Nevada!

It was some of the best tacos I have ever had. And my first time having a mula (it's like a small sandwich of tortillas with cheese, guacamole salsa and choice of meat). I always wanted them to be in the states.   I came to Vegas a few years ago and I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd, I can't believe my eyes! Tacos El Gordo! I immediately stopped and ordered my tacos.  Wow! Tasted the same as the small stand in Mexico! And they hand make their tortillas.   It's in a small plaza passing the Encore. Parking is sufficient. Outdoor and indoor eating areas. You have to order first and then pay. Your wait is a while, but well worth it! You have to stop here and eat!",

I came in once before and they must have ran out of masa for handmade tortillas because this time when I went in the tortillas were outstanding. It was very busy and the vibe was much better. It is hard to find authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. I am sure we have all experiences that were sub par. I believe in second chances and Tacos El Gordo has defiantly impressed. I had two El Pastor tacos with all the toppings and two with just onions, cilantro, and salsa(which is how I like them). Fruit is not for tacos or beer, just my opinion. Very quick service even though lines are long and everyone was very nice. It has been hot in Vegas and I was offered a water glass when I paid for my tacos. Thanks Tacos El Gordo, you have made many peoples recommendations, which I was doubting, to be True and good.",

I feel it's best to come here with at least one or two buddies. One, because there are multiple lines that you'll have to stand in if you want different meats. So if you want three tacos with three different meats that are in different lines, just bring two buddies! You can each order everything everyone wants and get it all hot at the same time.   I highly - HIGHLY - recommend the cabeza tacos. The head meat is SO tender and flavorful, that putting it simply on a taco is the way to go. An absolute must here are the loaded fries. We got them with adobada, but the fries are so perfectly cooked and LOADED with cheese, guac, and everything you would ever want to put in your mouth, that you could top it with mothballs and it would still taste good. My bffski and I went here and completely gorged with tacos, sopes, horchatas, and a full order of fries for only $20. I was also so pleasantly surprised by the large outdoor seating area. It has a roof, so you're not burning in the desert sun. Perfection.    If you asked me to, I would probably fly into Las Vegas just to come back here. Maybe I need to rearrange my priorities?",

In my opinion (shhh don't tell Mike C & James K) I think the food here looks better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong it's pretty yummy but I don't find myself craving it.. I feel like it's just your standard taco shop food that I can get from a regular taco truck parked on the street somewhere.. Oh and be careful I didn't think those grilled peppers could be that hot but last time I had a bite and my mouth was on FIRE for a hour.. lol   Hot Tip: don't forget to ask for some pineapple & drink the orange bang! OH And chat up the cooks and tip em.. They hook it up!!!",

Only downside is that it's always pack (that should say something about the food) so line can get pretty long at times. Best time to go to avoid the crowd is usually as soon as they open or around 10pm as everyone is either getting ready for bed or getting ready to hit up the clubs  *the long line is the reason for only 4 stars",

I'm glad we were there at like 2 AM, because based on the photos in all the other reviews, it looks like there is always a line at any other time of day/night.  I think we made it there just before closing. The El Pastor was shaved off a huge slab of meat rotating on a spit.  We each had two tacos and took them with us to eat outside.  Less than 10 bucks for all 4.  I don't care how far off the beaten path this place is, I'm making it a regular stop in Vegas.",

Always super busy, long lines, loud atmosphere, crappy parking, but all worth the hassle. Hole in the wall type place, so if you're ok with that, then this will work for you.   I feel like $2.25 per taco is a bit pricey but, the flavor makes up for the size. I easily take down 6 at any given time. Which lead to an expensive lunch/ dinner.   Coming from a taco lover, you wouldn't be mis directed in trying this place. Hope this helps.   Enjoy",

    "text": "A lot of people often wonder where to get authentic mexican food. This is total dive where you can find just that. I haven't tacos this authentic other than in mexico. They were really fantastic.  The location is in a strip mall in one of the \"dodgier\" sections of vegas. There was lots of families eating there, so i felt safe. However, I did feel like I had to order all my food in spanish, because everyone there spoke spanish! Unfortunately at the time, I was getting my spanish and german confused.... so that was difficult.  I got two adobada tacos and two asada tacos. I also got a can of fanta. It was about $10 for all this food. It was all incredibly delicious. Someone had commented that it tasted packaged- well, all guacamole consists of is mashed avocados with some other stuff like peppers and garlic, so most guacamole is pretty much the same.  I definitely preferred the adobada tacos. I felt like they were more flavorful. Plus, the first thing you see when you walk in is a thousand layers of pork, on a spit. It sort of calls out to you ; ) Oh, and I\"m pretty sure their tortillas are homemade. no store bought stale tortillas here : )  really delicious, very authentic, I think most people will enjoy this place, unless you're used to your mexican food being somewhat fancier and covered in cheese and sauces. If you don't like authentic mexican fare, then i'd skip this place. Also, I stopped by on a saturday afternoon and it was quite crowded. I'm lucky to have found a table. That may be something to watch out for though.",

    "text": "So, I had to come to Vegas to discover a restaurant that is also in San Diego!!!  Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one \"with everything\" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed (for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.    When in Vegas, I will visit again and now that I know that they are also in my home town, I will be making a drive down there soon as well!",

There are 3 different stations that you can line up for which serve different meats. The problem is that once you are lined up for one station there is no way you can go to the next station unless you get in line for that one which is another long wait. So if you are coming in groups each person can be split into different stations. Another thing these tacos are good but they are very greasy i couldnt eat as many because of the grease. Another thing is that those poor workers are so overworked. I feel sorry for them. They need more people, you see them in hypermode. I think unfair working conditions.  Not going back.",

Having said that, Tacos El Gordo is fantastic. 18 items on the menu- and they are all delicious. I personally had the lengua (tongue) and it is soooo tender. The cabeza (head) is outstanding, adobada is off the charts ( this must be one of your choices) and the El Pastor, also very good. I cant forget the quelsedillas. In a word, heavenly. It's chaotic and loud and you may have to wait, but in my experience, those are ALWAYS the best places.

I'm not sure how he ended up telling us about this place, but I am SO happy he did.   It's not far from the main part of the strip, just a few minutes past the Wynn in this janky strip mall area, but you can't miss it since there is a big sign at the front of the building.    You walk in and order right from the guy making your taco/burrito/nachos/fries/meat, and you can watch them making everything fresh.  I was especially excited that they were pressing and cooking their own tortillas on the grill right in front of me.  The way they cook their meat reminded me of a churrascaria, including the pineapple heads on the ends.  You could see the juice dripping allllll the way down the meat as it cooked on the spit...oh man. *drool*  We had just 1 carne asada fries to share between 3 girls and 1 carne asada taco to try.  This was more than enough food for us for our late night cravings.  Forget the crap fast food places on the strip after drinking.  If you want legit Mexican food late at night after partying hard in Vegas, do yourself a favor and grab a cab and tell them to get you to this tacqueria.",

    "text": "It was my first time at Tacos El Gordo so I was super excited to try their famous tacos. I wanted to try the al pastor, carne asada, and lengua tacos, which had their own separate lines so I had to line up three times but it wasn't too bad since it wasn't crowded at the time.  Al Pastor (3/5): it's definitely a unique type of al pastor taco, interesting sauce but I prefer a more simple style.  Carne Asada (2/5): the meat wasn't very flavorful, and the guacamole sour cream sauce overpowered everything in a bad way.  Lengua (4/5): surprisingly this was my favorite taco of the three, the meat was nice and tender and I enjoyed the salsa.  Overall I think Tacos El Gordo is a little overhyped. For $2.50 a taco it's not really worth it unless you can't find any other taco place around at the time. All the employees were friendly though.",

I would not bother with the hassle of hangry people and inefficient ordering system. Depending on what u order there are different lines. For example for those who want to try the cow tongue tacos, you have to order that in its own line. So if you like to try a wide range of meats then expect to wait in multiple lines. Oh best part, limited seatings. So if u want to venture into this highly rated place, expect long lines, food to go, and angry hangry people. Other than that...the tacos were good.",

Would have preferred to try the Asada but wasn't worth the wait.  After about 15-20 minutes of waiting in a line in a hot and crowded room, we get to the front and I ask the guy what else I can get in the line and he said he would recommend the beef shoulder.  We ended up getting 4 Adobada tacos and 4 beef shoulder tacos.  I was extremely skeptical because I just didn't think it was worth the wait and being from LA, I've had what I considered great tacos before.  Well, this place topped them all by a large margin.  I would recommend both tacos that we got.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and cut fresh, and the Adobada was cooking on the vertical spit.  The Adobada was perfectly cooked with a smoky flavor that I don't think is reproducible.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and tender and would take too much time to do.  There is a wait but it is well worth it.  This place is the blueprint for how a taco joint should be run.  Quality food, preparation, and selection.  Effing amazing!",

I was at Tacos El Gordo on a Saturday afternoon and decided to strap on the feed bag:  one adobada taco, one cabeza taco, and a small order of carne asada fries.  Sadly(?), something got lost in translation between the beef guy and the fries guy and I received a grande order of carne asada fries.  Yikes.  They only charged me for a small order, but still...  I devoured the tacos and made a pretty good dent in the carne asada fries.  Couldn't stop eating them, even though I knew I should.    Had to nap up for a couple of hours after getting back to the hotel due to a carne asada-induced coma.  Lost a couple of hours of gambling time, but I won't hold it against Tacos El Gordo.

However, since I grew up in San Diego, I do feel that the Tacos El Gordo in Diego is better, but for out of California?! This place is pretty spot on, satisfied my need for tacos...  Spend your money here...it will taste better then some buffets (ahem Planet Hollywoods suck)  My fave is the Carne asada and the hubbys was the pork.",

Skip the overpriced casino eateries and grab a couple of tacos for just $2 each (and you might even get a free tamale).",

Tacos were of decent size but it was loaded and each taco had their own sauce.  I thought the spicy pork was the best one and the tripe came second best! Spicy pork had a nice flavor to it and the tripe as well but the crunch to it was what made it bomb! They also give you a plate full of  grilled chile peppers and onions! Definitely would come back!",

I went to Tacos El Gordo as a spontaneous trip and it happened to be on a Saturday night.  It was very busy and the lines were long.  The wait wasn't too bad but there were 3 separate lines (different meat in each line) which isn't clear at all until the cooks yell it out.  So you could be in the front of the line and find out at the last minute that you are in the wrong line.  I had to constantly deal with other customers pushing through the lines to get to the soda machines.  Other than those things, the food was good but definitely try different meats.  I have gone twice and once I made the mistake of ordering 3 different items but with the same meat so everything tasted the same.  The menu isn't big but items are made to order and the tortillas are homemade.  All employees were working hard and I didn't notice any with attitudes.",

This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets! I've eaten numerous Mexican Foods in Arizona; but to me, nothing is ever comparable to them. Every time I go back to Vegas, I have to at least get a horchata there.  Okay, that's a lie! I have to get at least one taco...no, make that two!! I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line.  Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion.  I get so excited for places that are super delicious and this place is definitely worth the lost of water coming running out of my mouth. *drools!*",

This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Vegas. The staff is always working hard in the back and sweating there butts off because it's always so busy in there.   The place smells so good while you wait and it teases your senses making you anxious while you get closer to the counter and then BAM!! There it is. The delicious adobada! It is absolutely delicious. It is right there in front of you spinning on a steak while the chef cuts it off fresh for every order. Try the adobada (marinated pork) on anything. It is the best pork I've ever had in my life! Like this is better than bacon and they carve it off of the roast right in front of you. The tacos are so good and fresh!  Anything on the menu you're going to like. They have a large menu and anything you can think of, they have it on their menu. Make sure you know what you want to order though, and quickly because you have to go stand in the meat line of your choice. If you stand in the wrong line, you have to get out of line and go stand in the right line. That is a huge bummer.  This place is wonderful! It's the Mexican food you've always dreamed of but have never obtained. If you're in Vegas, leave the strip and head down to this place for some good grub. It's a really good price and worth it for the wait, because they're will be one. No matter the time of day or day of the week there will be a line because it's a really popular place!",

I wouldn't recommend going here if you're a vegetarian, if you wait in that big line for a quesadilla be ready to see the cow brains slowly sizzling in some pot. haha  And for all you meat lovers don't miss out on these tacos, I had basic Asada tacos and a quesadilla with meat and it was amazing. Great taco spot and reasonably priced!",

My favorite is their Adobada Fries, it is loaded with spicy pork and has their signature green sauce on it. SO GOOD.  It's such a hole in the wall, the people that know about this place will go straight there after landing (with their luggage in hand). If you ask me, they got their priorities straight :P  This is a MUST GO spot every time I am in vegas and it's definitely worth trying if you've never been!",

We had abodaba, tongue, and shoulder (over the course of our two visits) all with everything.  The adodaba comes with pineapple and somehow that makes it even better!    The line was longer at 9pm, but it still moved rather quickly.  Do note there are several  lines each making a couple kinds of tacos, not just one line and you can get fries at any of those.   Super delicious.  Totally affordable. Can't wait to go back.",

I lived in San Diego for 12 years and Tacos El Gordo was my favorite place to get tacos. I even went down to Tijuana (I lived like 15 minutes from the Mexican border) for some Tacos El Gordo and it tasted just as good.   My favorite is the Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and also mulitas (2 corn tortillas stuffed with lots of meat and cheese) The Adobada and Carne Asada were sooooo flavorful,tender, and juicy! The meat is piled high on your taco then they add onions, cilantro, guacamole, and salsa. The delicious meat just melts in your mouth. I also get grilled green onions, grilled jalapenos, lime and radishes on the side. Last time we were here we ordered it to-go so we can eat it at our hotel. I couldn't wait to eat at the hotel so I ate it in the car. Lol.",

It's not your typical Taco Bell. But what happens is the process is much like a conveyor belt or kind a like a chipotle style where you go in order and they ask you what you want and they Kinda speak mostly Spanish but you could just point and Grant and tell her you want this taco or that taco and show them how many by the number of your fingers and they understand. And the tacos, about the size of like your hand. and are filled with mainly just meet I'm no real veggies like a full-blown in a Taco Bell taco that you're used to but they have some side condiments and onions and hot sauce and some peppers they can put in an overall pretty good I had mine on corn tortillas him they also have a gigantic rotisserie with spicy type pork with a pineapple on top that's pretty good I recommend that I think it's called taco Al Pastore. Overall each taco was about two dollars and so an average meal to be about $10-$20 per person. Yeah I would like to go back I think it's a good place to go to if you want that nice quick meal thanks",

It took 20 minutes to finally place my order and you're only allowed to order certain things off of every window, so good luck if you're alone and want something that isn't being served at that window. The guy heard me wrong and gave me two Al Pastor's instead of 1 Al Pastor & 1 Adobada but whatever, no regrets since I love me a good Al Pastor. Their drink machine was also out of Horchata, so I was sad that I had a drink cup for no reason since I always carry water with me. The place is also very packed, so again, if alone, good luck finding a spot to sit. They do have outdoor seating but those are usually occupied as well. Had to eat outside by one of the trash cans since I couldn't get a seat. Hopefully, this place is at least better when it isn't a busy week like not during EDC week",

The food does not look anything like the pictures. The food is made way too fast, it lacks in ingredients and flavor. If you want a cheap version of Mexican food that is affordable, sure... try it if you must, but personally I would not recommend. This place is in walking distance of many hotels & clubs since it is on \"the strip\" hence explaining how busy it gets. The lines are incredibly long and move way to slow since people get multiple items. They should hire more help. They only have 1 restroom which is absurd. Not a lot of space when it comes to tables. Be prepared to eat outside, standing up. Ordering your food and then paying (in separate lines) is chaotic. Don't know how they make it work. This place also lacks in customer service. Staff could be a little friendlier.   I really wish they had chicken as an option. The adobada had a strong red color to it... I've never seen it that color, so I stayed away. I had the carne Asada fries. As soon as I opened the box, I was upset. It looked nothing like the picture that made me crave them in the first place. The meat was not well seasoned or cooked to my liking. Some meat was darker than the rest. There was not enough cream or guacamole salsa. I thought it came with pico de gallo as well, I guess I was wrong. The salsa wasn't as hot as I expected. I only ate about half, there was way too many fries and not enough toppings. Good portion, but not worth my money.   I would not come here again.",

First off, they have a terrible system for ordering your tacos and getting customers out the door. Each customer has to wait in line based on which type of meat they want in their tacos. If you want fries, you have to wait in an additional line. On top of those lines, you then have to wait in another line to pay. It took at least 45 minutes to get tacos.   They cook with charcoal which sounds great, until all you can breath is charcoal smoke. Your eyes start to burn and clothes stink like you've been at a campfire for weeks. It's a miracle no one has passed out with it being so hot in there, extremely smokey, and minimal ventilation. Honestly, it becomes hard to breath   Do not give in to the hype, this is not worth it! Should have just paid for a $25 quesadilla at the hotel.",

Oh and random, but they make their own tortilla!  Most tacos are $2.10. The ones I got were $2.10 each.   1. Carne asada - it was too hard and cooked too much. It was not worth waiting 45 minutes for just the asada.  2. Al pastor - DO NOT GET. It was super salty, wayyyyy too salty. Pretty sweet too. I was shocked. Even with the pineapple, it was pretty bad.   The tacos have too many things going on with it. They put a bit too much guac that I barley tasted the meat. I'm not sure if they just put really little of the other hot sauces, but I barely tasted those. They scooped way too much guac. It was too much. I'm never going to go back to the LV location, but maybe I'll try the SD one later on.",

I tried the al pastor (of course), the chorizo, the suadero, and the lengua tacos. My favorites were the al pastor and the lengua. SOOOOOO GOOD!! I wish there were more locations. Only downside was that we went on a 102 degree day so it was miserable to stand in line and the inside wasn't much better. But I would do it again to get my hands on those tacos!",

    "text": "If you ever wonder what it would be like to experience eating authentic Mexican tacos in Tijuana or any taco fast food place deep into Mexico then I highly recommend eating at this location.  With that said, be ready for long lines, total chaos, utter frustration, and complete anger as to how this company runs its business operations and treats their customers.  Though the food that we ate I would rate 3.5 stars. I'd say they charge higher than the average mini taco and have less meat. The corn tortillas were freshly made and spot on. CThe asada was good but not worth the wait. Lengua was okay which I wasn't a big fan of to begin with. Didn't try the adobado cause they wouldn't let me order in the same line as asada and told me to go wait in another line which would take another 20 min on a busy night. But I give this place two star rating based on my experience and lack of proper customer service and organization.   First off if you see the line out the door and around the fenced-in outdoor patio then I highly recommend skipping this location and opting for the downtown location in hopes of a much shorter line. Though we were told that the half hour line would go fast, what they don't tell you is another half hour to order your food once inside.  While waiting in line, I even witness some regular customers cutting ahead of line by entering the exit outdoor patio then entering the exit door and blend in to the different lines inside. They even have two security guards that are suppose to monitor the one entry and other exit door to keep people from cutting but they could care less and better occupied their time by either eating or chatting with next door employees.   Now if you want different kinds of taco meat and you alone then it would be an additional wait. That's because some executive genius thought it would be more efficient for them to have separate lines for certain kinds of taco meat. You want taco de asada then you wait in the center area lines for just beef tacos except beef tongue. You want taco de adobado, then you wait in different line, only one on each end for taco pork adobado. You want taco de lengua (beef tongue), then its the only one line all the way on the right around the counter. But wait, what if you want both and your by yourself?!?  Then they lecture you like a child that you must go wait in another line for that $2.25 mini taco! No ifs ands or butts. Then after waiting in multiple lines for your food, guess what? You get to wait in another line to pay for your food! Oh you want extra condiments like hot sauce, onions, or cilantro? Nope just limes and sliced radish at the condiment bar. You have to re-approach the counter to ask for condiments which your lucky if they serve you but most of time they'll say their out of hot sauce if their to lazy to go out of their way cause of the chaos that goes on. So make sure you ask for all your condiments up front as you place your order. So if you plan on eating a variety of different meat tacos then go with couple different friends or guests so you can each wait in all the different lines to order your food at same time then pay all together at the register.  I noticed that majority of the customers that eat at this establishment seem like hispanics that were born and raised in Mexico and seem to accept this kind of business operation and would never complain. But if your a newcomer or tourist, you'll be completely puzzled as to how this operation makes any sense. Otherwise wouldn't other Mexican fastfood establishments be incorporating this kind business model which they don't.   All in all I personally would not care to comeback to this establishment but it was a one time experience I'll never forget!",

The tacos were quite small, but three tacos were able to fill me up pretty well. Average price for the tacos were $3.00 which was a HUGE plus! We waited for around 30 minutes to get inside. But more lines inside depending on what you order.",

I am presuming that's not normal as the other two locations especially the one in TJ,Mexico was perfectly cooked and very soft (not crunchy); just to my liking. I ordered the Beef shoulder which seemed like a new type but sadly it was not very memorable. It was very lean and lacked much flavor. Also I got my favorite Beef Tongue tacos here but again was disappointed. They diced the beef tongue too much so it looked more like mush. The other places served my Beef tongue in generous portions and it was more diced than mushed which is how I liked it and expected. The Adobada was also just  \"meh\"; they gave me burnt slices so it was more crispy and burnt tasting =/  One thing I didn't appreciate here was they were giving pineapple slices to selective people in their Adobada tacos. That was absolutely not cool. I would not return to this location in my next trip to Vegas. I'll leave it to San Diego and TJ, Mexico for my Mexican cravings at a Tacos El Gordo.",

I'm not a meat eater so the only vegetarian friendly item on the menu was a quesadilla. My boyfriend ordered carne aside tacos. My quesadilla was literally the size of my palm, with just 2 slices on cheese on a extra small flour tortilla folded in half. They wouldn't put anything in it when I asked, which was okay because I thought that I could at least put some Pico de Gallo on the quesadilla or hot sauce...nope. They did not have a hot sauce bar, or even Pico de Gallo, which I found extremely odd. They did however give me chopped cilantro and chopped onion in a container. My boyfriend's meat had a ton of tendons, and was incredibly small with nothing else on it.",

The service was super friendly and always had a smile on. I was really REALLY impressed with the way they treated us.   I personally recommend Adobado because it is simply the best. Watching the guy knife off from the pork that is spinning and then grilling it on the grill until there is some crisp to it with their own made tortilla(which is awesome) and their home made guacomole sauce is simply AMAZING. I'm not even exaggerating how amazing it is but if you're not too into pork then....  I really love their Cabeza(which I tried to go to other places) and other places really suck and I thought it was disgusting. Simply they make the best cabeza which I never thought I would like, but it is just so good and drolling here. OF course, the other thing I absolutely love is Lengua. I don't think I had any lengua from other tacos joints to be this good. I just feel like you have the 3 choices which you simply can't forget to get and it's just so amazing.  I'm simply drooling from thinking about it right now but I'm just so far away. Oh El Gordo how i miss you so.  Perfect Drunk Food NOT TO MENTION :D",

Check their hours of operation before you come, because they do open late on Fridays and Saturdays. There aren't too many good cheap eats on the strip like this.  We always get the same things, but I'm sure that the other menu items are good too. I'd recommend the carne asada fries and al pastor tacos. You order in different lines depending on which type of meat you want, and then pay at the front cashier. Don't forget to ask them for extra red or green salsa behind the cash register. Its definitely not the best that I've had, but its pretty good to satisfy your taco cravings.",

Tip: it's easier if you show up with someone that knows Spanish, to translate and/or order off the menu. I tried to order what the guy in front of me got and ended up with something completely different. Oops. Still delicious, though! (Also important to mention: I was not in an intoxicated state wherein I would anything and everything.) Also, you can google \"how to order at Tacos El Gordo\" and that helps a bit.",

Always a line.   The food: Some of our group got pork tacos and some got beef. All were were very good! You can get the tacos with everything - cilantro, onion, salsa, and avocado, or any combination of the four. The tortillas are homemade, and the meat is freshly made. The tacos were very delicious and cheap!   The service: there was a long line out the door, but they were constantly getting through people fast! They were also offering water to people outside since it was hot! Very nice and attentive!   We did wait in line for 45 minutes, but it honestly didn't seem that long. I'd probably return, but would definitely prefer a shorter wait!",

In this case long lines means slow service. They suck. No idea how this place is either a four-star or a taco spot???? It does not deserve 4 stars or to even be called a Mexican taco spot.   For starters, from the time you get in line to the time you get to eat your soggy no flavor tacos a third of your day has been waisted.The way things are structured and organized there is horrible.   First you decide what type of tacos you want. Then depending on the meat you chose you get in line for then if you want a different type of meat you get in another line. Then after you are all done with your tacos you get in another line to pay. Then if you got a drink you get into another line. After you get your food and you decide to eat there you have to hunt for a place to sit so that could take another 15 to 20 minutes meanwhile your food is almost frozen. I suggest they invest in a few microwaves so people could re-warm their tacos.   I was there Labor Day weekend 2019 and I could honestly tell you that this is the worst taco spot that I've ever been to. Trust me I'm from LA and I've ate a taco or two...   Carne asada tacos had no flavor and the grilled onions and grilled jalapenos needed more time on the grill. Even my seven-year-old complained that it took forever in a day and that  all the drink lids were broken and that we should've just gone to Taco Bell!!!! LOL... I could keep going on and on about this crappy overrated place but this will just take my entire day.  If your 7 yr old is comparing them to Taco Bell you know this is bad.!!! Good luck and enjoy your time in Vegas just don't stop at this place and if you absolutely have no choice make sure you stop at Walgreens for a bottle of Pepto.",

There are literally two stores down the street from each other because the first one was so popular. Pro tip: there is a live tv on the door of the store that shows you the line at the second location.   My faves are the more obscure meats--brain, tripe, tongue, and head. I like all of them for their rarity, but the tongue is tasty and the head is so super soft. Definitely best street tacos in California and Nevada by a long shot. The workers here hustle hard!",

    "text": "This place is located in a strip mall. A tell tale sign that you are in the right place is the numerous exotic cars in the parking lot for rent. I'm talking lambos, ferraris, maclarans (sp?), etc. This eatery is located right off the main road so it's really easy to find and miss if you aren't paying attention. Also, parking is a little tight since it's a small strip mall with not a lot of parking. If you're lucky, you can just walk it. If not, parking is still pretty plentiful with people going in and out of the stores/eateries often.  Ok, so when you enter this place, there's a guard at the door. He's pretty much there so that people aren't blocking the doors and to make sure you go in and out of the correct door. Trust me, there's a ton of people who go out of the enter only door. You could just ask the guard to exit out of the entrance door. We did since we had a stroller and it was harder to get out the exit door than it was through the entrance door.  Okay, now pay attention because it gets a little confusing.  When you walk in, there are a bunch of different lines. If you look just below the menus, you will see a sign with the different items you can order from each line. Again, EACH LINE IS DIFFERENT. Don't go trying to order asada in another line that asada isn't listed because you won't get service. Also, if you order the fries, you will need to pick it up in another area of the restaurant. Again, big sign points you in the right direction. Once you get your food, proceed to the cashier which is just off of the drinks area. My suggestion is, if you are waiting for fries, just tell the cashier what you ordered (she can see it on your tray) and tell her you also ordered the fries (however you ordered it) and then she will add it to the bill and you pay right there. Once you pay, your fries should be ready at that point. Ours was.  The food is so tasty. The tacos are street tacos so they are small but delicious. The toppings are yummy. I'm a salsa girl so I eat all tacos, etc. with salsa. You can ask for salsa when you are paying for your food. The cashier has it in a refrigerator right behind them. I was actually full after having four tacos. They are small tacos but the meat is hearty and the cooks stuff them full of meat so it's a plus. My boy's quesadilla was also filled to the brim with meat. I forgot to ask for cheese on them but my boys ate them none the less. Two teenagers ate 2 quesadillas each. The other son ate the asada fries. That was delicious. It came with all the toppings. I have no idea how he ate a large order on his own but he did.  This place is super busy. If you can snag a table inside, go ahead and do so. If you can't, there's seating outside or you can just go back to your hotel or wherever you eat so that you can be comfortable. The prices are good and food is yummy in my tummy delicious. When in Vegas, we are definitely coming back here to get our taco fix. Well, and to look at the pretty cars in the parking lot.",

They have moved from their old location to right across the street.    So this place is crazy busy at all times of the day!  The wait outside was about 30 min long but then there is a crazy line inside.  There are two lines inside for adobada (pork), carne asada (beef) and then single lines for brain, tongue, etc, Fries (adobada, carne asada etc).  They don't tell you how it really works, you either figure it out or you ask a customer and hopefully they help you.  Lucky my cousin was with us so we kinda got a low down.  I stood in the adobada line while my husband stood in the carne asada line to order our food.  My father in law found a table to sit at because it was crazy busy.  You grab a tray when reaching the front of the line and tell the persons what you'd like, how many tacos, sopes, quesadilla etc of that particular meat and what sauces etc you would like on it. He/she hands you your order and put out it on ur tray.  Once you grab your food you need to go to the cashier with your tray and order you drinks (they have fountain drinks and water, no alcohol) and pay for your food.   My fave was the carne asada taco.  The adobada was alright.    The staff is sooooo busy working hard but they are helpful.",

    "text": "Vegas Tacos Go To.   For 3 day's in a row Sunday - Tuesday I saw this placed packed! Lines formed down the block. As early as 10am until later in the afternoon.   There is a reason for sure why this place is so popular. Not your average tacos! The meat is nice and tender and cooked perfectly. The sauce/salsa is outstanding. Mini bar available to add additional condiments. Can and fountain drinks available. The tacos are on the smaller side so if your hungry, order plenty or get you an order of their rather large portion size unique fries. Great plus to the tacos is the fact that the tortillas are hand made fresh! Yum! that always takes tacos to another level. I believe you can order an order of plain tortillas both corn or flour. The fries are a nice twist to a great street style taco. Very large portions. A small order is more than enough for 2 people, you may even stretch it to 3 people. A mouth full of flavor!   The downside and why I knocked a star down is due to their order system. I heard people complaining and with good/understandable reason. My tacos were cold when I ate them. They have several sections of which you get in line depending what you want to order. Between 2 people having to jump to two separate lines each, it was almost not worth the wait & process. If it wasn't because the food tasted so good even half cold, I would have passed on Gordo's. There are plenty of employee's of which they work fast! However the actual system and the amount of people creates a sloppy mess. On top of waiting in line for whatever food you want, you then have to wait until your whole order is complete to get in another long line to pay. Unless you want to make multiple purchases, that's another option...I was proud of my patience despite being very hungry.   No chorizo available (fan of chorizo).",

    "text": "So, wanted some Mexican food and to my surprise we did a drive by and went in.  The people are very helpful as I had no idea what was what.  And even the customers were friendly and explain things.  Most of them all spoke spanish and they told you what was good to eat.    We ordered the steak tostadas and tacos for safe choices and then did some off the path stuff like brain and tongue, which was not bad.  We also got some pork tacos which were pretty good.    What I really liked was they make the corn tortillas from scratch and right there on the grill.  They add cilantro, onions, and guacamole to the tacos and for the mystery meat they put some green sauce on it.    Price was about $2.45 for one order of tacos (two street style tacos) and the same serving size for the tostadas.   It's very much a diner like place where it's kind of loud and its clean. The soft drinks are self service and they do have your array of mexican drinks.    Overall, it was decent and I would go back again.",

You order at the counter than walk to the other side pick up your foot than head over to cashier to pay and get your drinks.  We ordered a couple of tostadas, and tacos.  Their pastor which they simply call pork looked beautiful roasting on the spit with pineapple on the top.  However, it tasted more like Chinese BBQ pork.  The tortilla and salsa they used was good, but they add it for you and it frankly needed more.  We tried the tostadas with the beef head meat.  The beef head was quite tender, had good flavor, the tostada was a little hard and stale.  Again not enough salsa.  My son had a quesadilla, which there version is a bit different it comes open with a crunchy tortilla.  The reason for the extra point off, my wife ordered no onions and they put onions on every taco, and wife speaks fluent Spanish.  Also the place was full of mosquitoes, I can usually tolerate a few here and there but this was bad, they need to step up their cleaning.",

The tortillas are handmade and the salsas that they use are very tasteful, not spicy at all but with an amazing taste. The AlPastor is always my go to, which was a perfect choice ordering it here. Extremely juicy and the blend of everything (meat, onions, cilantro, salsa, and a cream guacamole) is perfection. The Asada was my second best, although the meat slices are a bit on the thick side. Highly recommend. Will satisfy your cravings.!",

Before heading to a friend's house, we stopped by to pick up some grub.  First of all: Why is the ordering system so complicated for no reason? You can only order certain items through certain people. One person takes your order for certain meats, the other person takes the order for other items.  Anyway, after discovering how ordering works, we ordered several tacos and quesadillas.  The cool thing is that the adobada gets carved right in front of you. The tacos get assembled on the spot too.  I'm not sure if I've been eating different quesadillas my whole life, but the quesadillas here are... different. I'm not putting it against them or anything, but these were definitely not the quesadillas I'm familiar with. The taquerias at home are the quesadillas I've eaten my whole life. Meat, cheese, and sometimes sour cream.  Of course the guy we ordered from wasn't the grilled peppers person, so we had to go into a different lane to get said peppers. The woman gave us a glare and tossed in a measly 2 peppers for a large meal. I didn't realize requesting peppers was such an ordeal.  The tacos were good, but honestly with how unnecessarily complicated everything is, I think I'll go elsewhere if I'm in the mood for tacos.",

If you go and the lines look RIDICULOUS, don't worry. It actually goes by rather quickly, but I can't guarantee that you'll get a table.

It is busy and goes fast, I had a hard time figuring out how the menu works so I just ordered something I saw on yelp. I looked around and saw all kind of things, if only I knew what/how. I ordered the taco el pastor with pineapple and mula el pastor, both with the carne asado. It looks like shoarma but it tastes nothing like it. It was good but the meat I wouldn't order again. Unfortunately there's not really other options here, not that I know of at least (didn't see chicken). The food was really good, the taco and mula were top noch. Other taco places can learn something from here!",

They have each counter labeled with the different meat options you just walk up to the counter that has the meat of your choice and order. Then once you get your food there's  is a counter off to the right to pay by the drink fountains.   I got 3 tacos one chicken one steak and one pork. All amazing and loaded with meat. I also ordered the Asada fries.. OH EM GEE. AMAZING. They're packed with steak and this delicious special sauce. Also there's cheese avocado and a spicy sauce on them. The fries were worth coming here alone.   I recommend 10/10 to anyone in the area!!!",

The tacos are a good size and they stack it with meat. I've had the al pastor which is AMZING. the lengua is also good. The sauce and tortillas are a plus as well. Overall a perfect taco. The have a salsa bar that is filled with goodness!  Just prepare yourself for a long line but so worth it.",

I tried the adobada fries and adobada tacos. The fries do come in 2 sizes, half and full order.  It was good but I can tell it tasted a little different. But it did satisfy my cravings.    The concept is the same. You wait in line to order your food and then pay at the register. The line went out the door and wrapped outside.",

If TEG were around during my Vegas heyday, I would have gone after EVERY XS/Encore night.  We ordered Adobada, lengua & carne asada tacos as well as a half order of campechana fries (topped with adobada, carne asada, guac and cheese).   The adobada is the way to go here! It's like an al pastor spit where the cook freshly slices it when you order & the corn tortillas are toasted in the adobada fat.   The carne asada and lengua are good but not as good as the adobada.   For 8 tacos, a half order of fries (which is already a huge portion btw), and a fountain drink, it was ~$30. I feel like this is just a smidge pricier than the Chula Vista location, but still worth it!   77/365",

The ONLY reason I didn't give this review 5 stars is because of the limited seating compared to the amount of customers they have. I had to eat my tacos standing up so my family would have a place to sit. Other than that I would recommend this place to everyone",

We arrived early and waited for the doors to open. When they did, my partner and I split up into 2 additional lines. Specific meat or tacos were specific lines only. It took us 30 mins to get our tacos from 3 lines. Once we did, we both found the food to be good and well seasoned.   I had adobada, carne asada, lengua, and tripas. All were good but would rate the carne asada the Best flavored, followed by the adobada, then the other two. Very filling and delicious.",

    "text": "If you're in Vegas, you must stop here!!!   Conveniently located right next to Encore (and walking distance from Trump and many other hotels), Tacos El Gordo is a great place for a (sometimes) quick and delicious dinner. Their layout is basically identical to the original San Diego one as there are multiple lines for different meats. Once you reach the front of the line, tell the cook VERY clearly what meat and how many tacos you want. I say this with an added emphasis because my 8 lengua and 1 tripa somehow turned into 8 lengua and 8 tripa... After you're done ordering and receive your food, make your way to the cash register near the door and pay for your heaping tray of deliciousness. From there on out, it's your choice to bring your tacos home to-go or find a table to eat at.   Food here is really good and hit the spot for me and my family when we visited. The quality is the exact same as the SD one and I was very satisfied with the customer service received. Personal favorites are lengua and al pastor! This place did not disappoint so next time you're famished and starving after a long trek down The Strip, make a stop at Tacos El Gordo for a satisfying and hearty meal.",

Came here during the summer, it was hot and thankfully the line was not long, waited about 30-45 min outside then went in and had to wait for another 20-30min (at least in the asada line). They have their lines divided, starting from left to right: adobado/pastor meat, asada was the next line (they longest waiting line), then all other meat: tripa, tongue. After getting your food, you have to walk to the cashier table near the exit to pay for your food and then sit down. This place is very busy and gets really pack so seats are minimal for big groups. My group and I was lucky to find enough seats for 10ppl. Service was ok, food was flavorful and tasty. Also they had fountain drinks available and I thought their horchata was freshly made thinking that this is from Tijuana Mexico, but it was not so this was the only disappointment. In addition, their quesadilla is NOT like the American quesadilla so don't expect it that way- its more like a large taco. Overall, this was a great experience and good was great with lots of meat! I would come here again.   Tip: have someone in your party to find seat while the others order your food",

Upon arrival you'll probably get hit by several lines and be confused af, ask one of the staff to explain each of the lines to you so you can line up according, sometimes they can get other things from other lines for you if it isn't too busy. When youre done picking and choosing all the tacos, (seriously get ALL OF THEM!) as well as a order of fries (half portion is enough for 2) get in the cashier line and pay the lady! it might be hard to find a seat sometimes especially if you're visiting on a busy weekend.   The service is very fast-food but everyone is very friendly and will engage in conversation if you want. its as authentic as it gets.   The price is cheap but it surely does not affect the quality of the food. I had tacos in New York at the Chelsea Market  and it was 3.99 EACH taco, for less than half of that Tacos EL Gordo has you beat ;)  The location was very easy to find there is also parking for those who chose to drive. Its also walking distance from the Wynn-Encore hotel!   This has became a Vegas-Must for me personally every time I come, my visits were 3 years apart but the quality hasnt seemed to have changed whatsoever,",

If you are a taco lover it will be hard to get full unless you are willing to spend $30. They are very small compared to a regular taco from any taco truck. Although there is no risks here, the meat is great quality and the taste is the closest you will get to trying a taco in close resemblance to ones in Mexico. Another thing is this place is always busy, this location is always busy. There is always a line so be prepared and come in 1 or 2 hours before the time you usually get hungry. It's a line to order and it's another line to pay. Overall I give it 4 stars based on the price but taste wise it's the best taco I've tried so far in Vegas without suffering repercussion the next morning.",

After ordering the dishes and receiving your food, you must go to a different line at the cash register to pay for everything. I think that concept is quite strange, and I would like to see that changed if possible. I love that we get our food very soon after we order it, but it is such a tease to have to stand in another line after receiving our food.  As for the food, it is the perfect place to go to if you are craving Mexican food. The meat for the tacos were very tender and soft. The carne asada fries did not have as many toppings such as salsa, beans, etc. as I normally get. But, the portion was still large and I really enjoyed it.",

I was craving some affordable authentic Mexican food, and thought I'd have the place pretty much to myself on a Sunday morning around 11am. Not so much.  They were very busy and I found out after a while that there were also separate lines for different meat. Oops. I ordered the spicy pork tacos, lingua, and asada tacos. I loved that they had fresh guacamole on top and also verde salsa. The tacos were fresh and good, but I felt that they were missing something. Maybe the roja salsa? Also, I love it with the creamy jalapeno sauce, and they didn't have that either. So I wasn't quite getting the spice level or sauce that I wanted, but they still hit the spot when I needed it.  Also, you are supposed to order, get your food, pay, then eat. It's sorta a weird system and I wasn't aware of that when I stopped in and had to tell them what I ordered at the end.",

Let me tell you, if I could, I would take a turbulent flight back to Las Vegas for some chorizo tacos and some carne asada fries right this second.  When approaching the plaza El Gordo is in, you can definitely tell its not the upscale part of Vegas.  Trust me, I definitely felt sketchy walking up to this place, I was thinking \"what's my cousin thinking? We're in Vegas, let's go eat at a buffet or something\", but my cousin stood her ground! We ended up waiting in what seemed to be SUCH a long line, but it moved pretty quickly. It can be expected to wait around 30-45 mins. We ordered and what impressed me most is everything is made to order, even the tortillas! So fresh, so good. Getting to watch your food being made, even better, smells and all.  I would say that the experience that you would receive here is no different than a fast food restaurant. Order food, pick up and pay. Tacos El Gordo is not a really waitressed place although there is tons of seating. Even when there was so much seating it was super packed so we decided to take it to the car to enjoy. I can tell you right now, that it's the most authentic Mexican food I've EVER had and it's the BEST Mexican food that I've ever tasted.  I guess the saying is right, \"you should never  judge a book by its cover\".",

The masses cannot be wrong, and they aren't. If I lived here, I'd be getting tacos here once a week.   The assembly line moves fairly quickly and each taco is made, sliced, and chopped to order. I went with the spicy pork and tripe tacos. These little guys are surprisingly filling; don't let their size deceive you. The pork tacos were tender and juicy, with just stumble hints of sweetness and spice. Excellent. The tripe tacos are a little chewy, a little crispy, and a little funky. If you like funkiness and organ meat, this is for you. The fat in the meat almost gets caramelized to the point of it sticking in your teeth. Its some quality offal.   If you are in town, come slightly off of the strip and get yourself a few tacos, and thank me after.",

This was on a Sunday morning so we thought it would be less crowded. But there was nowhere to sit either. The food was good especially the loaded fries but I don't eat much meat so I can't comment on that. It was just really loud and crowded and took forever so I'd suggest going when you're not starving.",

    "text": "I would say this place would of been great if their tortillas weren't so rock hard, dry with razor sharp edges and if they offered hot sauces or fresh salsas. I'm way too much of a sauce snob and I admit it. I was very disappointed that there was no salsa bar or sauce for that matter. The tacos could of used a nice dollop of moist and flavorful salsa.  Granted the carne asada (beef) and the adobada (pork) were marinated well and very tender, I needed a spicy kick in my life! Even the grilled jalapeno pepper they offered us wasn't spicy.   I favored the adobada over the carne asada, it seemed more tender. Also, the taco de cabeza (head) was really oily, we took a bite and couldn't eat the rest.  The vampiro, had a sopes masa cake bottom and a crispy fried tortilla tostada-like top. It was filled with carne asada (or any meat you choose), a dense piece of rubber-like cheese, and topped with lots of their guacamole sauce and cilantro and onions. It was tasty, hard to eat, and extremely filling!   Their avocado sauce that they put on everything tasted good, but it was very thick and filling. It's not made of 100% avocados and they may of added some type of filler in it.   Make sure to ask for a complimentary plate of grilled green onion and peppers, they don't offer it unless you ask for it.  6 small tacos, 2 vampiros, and a soda totals $23.02",

That sort of thing. Luckily, I had a guide. He lead me into the promise land of PASTOR Y ADOBADA line.  Once your in line, the hard part is over. What to order? Just get tacos with everything on it. What's the everything they put on it? There was cilantro and a bunch of other stuff and some sauce in there. Who knows what it all was but it was fresh flavor explosion. It's hard not to get double digit tacos in line. The meat is on point, juicy and flavorful. The tortillas were little warm circles of deliciousness. I also got a quesadilla where they toast one tortilla and put some Oaxaca cheese in there. Weirdest quesadilla I'd ever seen but it was damn good though.   The challenge is to get a seat really. Luckily, they do also have \"to go\" option where they wrap up your plate of tacos with aluminium foil, like you just left a party with some food to take home to the kids. Being well lit and remarkably clean despite the throngs of people in there was amazing.",

However, it IS a great addition to cheaper alternative food options in vegas besides china town. Both the adobada and carne asada are good. The adobada line is much shorter and had died down even while we were waiting for carne asada. We coulda stood in the adobada line 3 times in the time it took to even get a carne asada taco. My suggestion if you dont have time you can totally skip the carne asada and just get adobada.  I got a carne asada Mula, which is like a quesadilla cept its not sealed in? You can also think of it as a taco sandwich if one taco is an open-faced sandwich with one slice of bread then the mula is like having two slices of bread and more cheese in between.   Right now they have two lines for carne asada and two lines for adobada. Due to the popularity of carne asada, they should totally just have 3 lines for that and 1 line for adobada.",

In 1998, Tacos El Gordo opened its first location in San Diego, California, and in 2010 opened its first location in Las Vegas.  PARKING ======== Strip mall.  AMBIANCE ========= Crowded, noisy, and somewhat small. Grab a table inside or outside.  NOTES:  #1 - There are different lines to order for different things. Be sure to designate and assign your party members to get in a specific line to order specific items.   #2 - You order FIRST in line and then you go to ANOTHER line (the cashier) to pay. Not very convenient, especially during busy hours.  FOOD ===== CARNE ASADA FRIES - $10 I like perfect fries with meat and toppings. So, these were OK. The fries could have been a bit more crispy. I like the version in San Diego better. RATING: 3/5  ADOBADA TACOS - $2 My favorite.  Pork marinated in a \"red\" chilli sauce with vinegar and oregano was perfect. RATING: 5/5  PASTOR TACOS - $2 Pork is marinated in a combination of dried chiles, spices and pineapple. Ask for pieces of the pineapple off the spit. RATING: 5/5  CEBOLLINES (GRILLED GREEN ONIONS) - PRICE N/A Nothing special, not much flavor. A bit oily. RATING: 3/5  BEVERAGES ========== HORCHATA Not the best I've had. Too mild. I want more cinnamon. RATING: 3/5  SERVICE ======= They are efficient, but not exactly smiley friendly.  RECOMMEND for hangovers, groups, and cheap eats.",

I'm out of there by 2:30 and making the 5 minute walk (From Wynn/Encore) for some TACOS!  The al pastor tacos and abodabo fries are all I ever get here.  Its deliciously flavored and they make it right in front of you!  They slice and dice and throw everything together right there for you to see!  The tacos come on double corn torilla with their signature green sauce.  The abodabo fries has abodabo on top of skinny fries and lathered with sour cream, guacamole and the green sauce.  NOM NOM NOMZ.  Skinny fries should be the only fries allowed!    So you order at one of the stations that are labelled with the kind of meat they serve and after you get your food, you head to back to the front to pay for everything.  There are a lot of tables but there are also usually a lot of people but it moves pretty quickly.  They have a nice salsa bar with all kinds of condiments to make your meal all that more enjoyable.  There are two abodabo  lines so if you're in a really long line, look around as the other one is typically a lot shorter.",

I was in Vegas solo this time around, so I took a buddy out to taste this place, as he as a local had never been. I ordered 11 Adobada tacos and that alone LOL. 6 for me, 5 for my buddy. The line took forever and a half to get to the front, but was well worth it. TIP: If you speak Spanish, the folks that make your tacos at the front of the line, can be nicely asked if they don't mind getting you some tacos from another line, so you don't have to make line for a different meat. Had to get some to-go tacos for another friend who wasn't able to meet up with us to dine, and they wanted tacos de lengua, but that was a different line. So I kindly asked the gentleman at the Adobada line if he could get me a few lengua tacos. He said they can, but has to be aa couple max, so I asked for 4 lengua tacos and he obliged nicely. Tipped him for it on the jar in front, and on our way we went.  The thing I love about this place is that regardless of when you come, the quality of the food, the texture, and the sauces... it all remains constant. That is why I believe so many people flock to TEG on their Vegas trips. Needless to say, I shall be back next month when I'm in town for the Mayweather/McGregor fight!!",

If you want an Asada taco and a tongue tacos you will have to stand through multiple lines! God for bid you're somebody like me who wants chicken, they do not even offer it. You are allowed red meat, the other white meat/pork or organs....no chicken. I waited in line for 45 minutes to get a tostada....which they were out of, then I had to get in a second line to get a taco al pastor. It is a complete nightmare. You stand in all the lines getting your food, the drinks are on the different side of the store and then all the lines merge into this absolute terror as you have to pay for your food next to the exit, so........after all the lines, you're now combating with people trying to leave while paying for your food before you can eat. It would be so easy to fix this problem, have three guys working on meat prep while 2 or 3 people are taking orders and put the register somewhere near where you're taking orders! The food flavors here are absolutely flat best. They added red and green salsa to every item I ordered without Asking permission but it was perfectly fine since the salsas have absolutely no heat, there was no hint of garlic or onion or any recognizable flavor, it just added color to each item. While I was standing in line in over 100 heat for more than 30 minutes at one point every person stop taking orders because they are required to cook their own meat for their station, so the entire line, every line, comes to a complete stand still while they prepare their own meat before they will start taking our own orders again. SKIP IT!",

    "text": "While now living in the Bay Area, I grew up in San Diego where I got spoiled with good Mexican food.  In a way, I took it for granted.  The Bay Area has some of the best food spots around, but in terms of Mexican food, I'm sorry, it just doesn't cut it.  Every time I go back to San Diego, I always make 1 or 2 (or 3) stops at Tacos El Gordo.  While I don't go to Vegas too often, it's good to know that I can do the same there, as well.  When it comes to Tacos El Gordo, the 1 thing you have to get is the Adobada taco.  It's spicy pork (although, not very spicy at all) it comes with a green sauce that complements it perfectly.  When you see the pork being shaved off the spit rod, your mouth will start to water.  Also good is the SD-staple, carne asada.  The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked and is served with the freshest guacamole.  Not the watered down stuff you will find at the taquerias here in Northern California.  If I go with a group of friends, we will almost always share an order of the Campechana fries.  It is similar to carne asada fries you will find throughout San Diego, but is made with Adobada meat, as well, and is served with that same green sauce that is served on the tacos.  If you like some of the other cuts of meat that usually go with tacos, then they probably have those here, too.  I'm talking about Lengua (Tongue), Buche (Pork Stomach), Cabeza (Beef head), or Tripa (Beef Guts).  They also have different vehicles for all their meats, like Mulas, Tostadas, Suadero, or Sopes.  They also have quesadillas, in which you can add meat, if you want.  They are pretty small though, so if you're hungry, get a few.  One last thing to mention is expect to wait in line.  Don't think you can go at 10am, when they open, and beat the crowd.  Or, go at midnight thinking everyone's in the club or asleep.  Nope.  There will be a line.  Guaranteed.  But, they do have several lines when you actually get in.  One or two lines will have adobada, and other ones will have the other meats.  I want to say they go fast, but they don't.  They are fast making the food, but I think people order so much that it takes time.  The Adobada line does go fast though, for whatever reason.  P.S.  Don't forget the Horchata!!!",

The tortillas are freshly handmade right in front of you, the meats carved from a spit right before it lands on your plate. FREE guac ( u Chipotle) and complimentary vegetables + grilled jalapeno if you ask for it. Wide variety of meat offerings and every taco is made to perfection.  It must be super annoying serving so many drunk people so late at night, but every worker I spoke to was super nice and accommodating. I have 3 days left in Vegas and you can bet I'll be back several times before the trip is over!",

    "text": "I'll be honest. I was not impressed by the food here. My friends seem to think that this place makes some bomb ass Al Pastor tacos, which is exactly what I decided to go with but...I'm sorry to say, it did not live up to the hype that my friends made it out to be.   They claim that the Al Pastor taco's would, hands down, beat out and beat down any taco stand that's found in East LA and I'm like, \"For reals, homie?\" And to top it off, I hadn't eaten all frickin' day so these tacos better be frickin' bomb ass full of flavor, grease, and meat juices. It didn't happen. I tasted the meat but the meat juice? No taste. I tasted the grease and the sauce but...it didn't make me want to keep shoveling the rest of the tacos into my mouth. Nope. Not one bit.   I mean, to be fair, I think it tasted fine. The color and texture reminded me of Chinese BBQ Pork. Not kidding at all. The sauce that came with this taco totally through off the pork flavor, in my humble opinion. I think it would have been better without any sauce. Just meat, cilantro, onions, and the tortilla. My friends who are Mexicans, by the way, kept insisting that you get to taste what 'real' pork is supposed to taste like and I guess what they meant is that I'll get to taste the \"pure pork\" flavor, which I totally disagree with.   Look, homie. I may be Chinese and don't speak a lick of Spanish but understand for a moment here that Al Pastor, by definition, is marinated pork. Not plain pork. MARINATED PORK. That means if you decide to go with this, you're not going to get the \"pure pork\" flavor no matter how hard you try precisely because it's been marinated in sauce over night (or several nights for that matter!). What you'll end up tasting is the sauce, not the meat. Now, if the sauce wasn't overwhelming, which in this case, it was, then sure. I would have been able to taste the \"pure pork\" flavor as you say. But sadly, homie, you totally blew it for me.   At $2.25 a pop, jeebus, these are some overpriced 'fancy' tacos, yo. No joke. I'd take a taco stand in the ghetto streets of East LA that charges $1.25 or less over Tacos El Gordo and that's real talk right there. I would, hands down, choose Tacos El Gavilan or King Taco over this joint and I'm not even that big of a fan of Tacos El Gavilan or King Taco.   The lines are unusually long and they won't let you order from the same window the different meat cuts or the other things on their menu. There's only two lines for Al Pastor only and one line for everything else. Jesus Christ! Who the hell invented this retarded system?!? If you want to get the other meat cuts or anything else in their menu, you better have a buddy with you to line up on the other line; otherwise, you'll have go all the way back to the very back of the line and try again.   On top of that, the line to get your food and the line to pay are separate stations. WTF Tacos El Gordo??? Again, makes no frickin' sense. So after you get off the ordering line, you have to get back in line to pay. Now, granted, yes, it's True that the lines tend to move pretty fast. I'll give them credit for that but it's still a frickin' line. And it's no guarantee that you'll find a seat--inside or outside.   But honest to God, I gave these tacos a real shot. I kept munching on them thinking maybe the \"real pork flavor\" will come to the fore after the 1st taco, the 2nd taco, the 3rd taco and when I got down to my 6th taco and was every bit not impressed as the first, I was quite thoroughly disappointed.   All in all, Tacos El Gordo? Your food is okay. Just okay. Not decent, not good, just okay. I'll eat here if I have to but I'd rather go somewhere else for Al Pastor tacos, if I'm being perfectly honest. I guess the Hispanics here in Las Vegas have forgotten how to make real Mexican food in the ghetto streets of East LA. My advice to all y'all Hispanics and Mexicans living in Las Vegas to come over (or come back) to East LA and remember your roots, yo!",

The parking lot is definitely small, so be smart about how you get there.   There's usually a line, but don't worry it's totally worth it. There's a security guard outside who will help with the line. Once you get in, you'll need to choose a line to get into. Each line has its own specialities. For example, one line was for the Al Pastor/Adobada meats, and the other was for carne asada and lengua. All meats are good, but the spicy pork (al pastor) is my favorite! You can get the meat in whatever you'd like- sope, Taco, etc. (tacos can come in corn or flour tortilla).   Get your order and then pay in the back corner of the restaurant. Seating is limited so maybe have someone in your group go save some spots. They serve soda and horchata, and have salsa upon request. Lime and radish is on the side bar for you to get yourself.   PS. If you order fries, you'll have to go to the side of the restaurant to pick it up (the side nearest the restrooms).",

The set up means you order at the counters first (to be honest, was confused about where to line up because there are different sections), pick up your food, and then pay at the register (at an opposite corner of the restaurant). It's so very tempting to eat the food while you're in line to pay.   As for the food, I got the tacos adobada (I believe this is their spicy pork), which was delicious. The slightly green sauce is really yummy and the standout is definitely the meat. However, one of my friends got the adobada fries and the portion is big and delicious. Love the combination of fries, cheese, sauce, and meat! Would definitely recommend this.  All in all, a pretty perfect place to eat after a night of drinking. The staff are friendly and work quickly to get your orders (though the set up is a little weird). And the adobada tacos and fries! The food is so yummy, our Lyft driver also stopped there to eat after dropping us off!",

They serve authentic Mexican Tacos and the tortillas are from Mexico. 5 stars for the price and quality of food. Whenever I am in Vegas, I always go here to eat tacos. This particular location gets busy and sometimes the line is out the door. I ordered my two favorites beef tongue (lengua), and spicy pork (adobada).  Beef tongue tacos:  The beef tongue tacos are my favorite! The meat is very tender and it melts in your mouth. They cut the meat right in front you of you, and tacos are made to order. They add a green salsa sauce and veggies.     Spicy pork:  The spicy pork is served off a spit, and the tacos are made to order. The tacos comes with a creamy green sauce that is very good.",

    "text": "So when you walk in here depending on the day it csn be really busy.  The seating situation is pretty tight and limited inside .  They do offer outside seating but there is not much out there either.  It can get so full at times you end up basically stalking people watching them hoping  someone's  party is going to get up soon so you can swoop on in and get thier seats.  Good thing I had kids I can send them looking/ stalking around for seats for the family lol.   However when we were  leaving we did see that just across the street they wre either relocating or opening another location.  Hopefully it is another location.  They have four separate lines that serve different tyes of meats.  Two of the lines offered alpastor meat it's cooked on a spic and perfectly seasoned according to my husband,  I don't eat them.   One offers carne asada and another offeres tripas,buche,and cabeza, and lengua.  I go there for the tripa tacos myself, those are my favorite especially when they are cooked perfectly crispy.   You can get asada fries or alpastor fries, ect but their specialty is tacos. I have also had thier tacos de lengua those were good too.   For me this is my favorite place to get authentic Mexican tacos.  I normally don't like all the crowded places  but in my opinion the tacos are so good it's worth it.   Oh and one more thing...they have orange bang!",

The multiple different lines and payment process isn't very clear and the staff seemed too annoyed to be helpful. Also when we went a friend asked for specifics for his order based on allergies and they completely ignored him and just put whatever they wanted on there. Also within 5 minutes of leaving the restaurant everyone who had the steak had to take horrible shits.",

We bought a few tacos and the price was cheap. Don't expect something fancy, no fancy just great authentic street tacos and that's what I was craving. I'll be back for sure if I go back to Vegas !!",

Pull up to Tacos El Gordo and see the massive line outside (95% of time, there WILL be a LINE outside).  Fret not, the line goes pretty quickly my friends.  2.  Get in line.  This is when you make your game plan.  If you want more than one meat, hopefully you're with a friend or two.  There's about 3-4 lines inside separated by what meat you plan to get.  Strategize so everyone in your group knows which line they're going to and what they're getting.  Write it down it make note in your phone if you have to.  3.  Get inside.  Chaos!  Wait, you planned for this. Relax.  Get in your line and know your order.  4.  Order.  Regroup.  Pay.  ENJOY!  And I mean ENJOY!  My eyes are always way too big for my stomach here.  I can't help it.  It all looks and smells so good.  I can't help myself.  All their meats are full of flavor that I couldn't possibly pick my favorite.  I've tried them all.  Don't be afraid of the lengua and cabeza friends, they are indeed delicious and worth trying.  If you'd like to venture out of the regular taco, also remember there is the vampiro.  Basically the contents of the taco with melted cheese inside two crispy tortillas.  A yummy crispy taco sandwich ready for your consumption.",

There are multiple lines with signs saying what kind of taco you can pick up. It's confusing at first, however, people are very helpful & friendly.  DH's favorite was the spicy pork, which wasn't actually that spicy. You can get it with a little pineapple. They shave it off a pineapple impaled on the top of the vertical spit. All of our tacos were yummy. Spicy pork, though, was the best!  The tacos are small. DH is a light eater & he killed 4 without difficulty. So, not that cheap, but still a good deal by Vegas standards.  The place is crowded with locals, but turnover is quick so you can grab a table after you pay. Dinged them one star because their drink machines ran out of flavor syrup. We waited a long time, but they didn't refill it. First time around, the horchata & tamarind drinks were excellent.",

Man the lines can be crazy long/out the doors and they even have a security guard or whoever directing you where to enter and which line to stand in. Soooo my friend and I stood in the \"asada\" line since we wanted carne asada tacos. Man the wait was sooo long and sooo not worth it. And we ordered like 15 tacos and I'm still sooo sad we ordered 15 tacos and it wasn't even delicious (but of course I still ate it). Anyway, place is busy, and not a lot of seating. Pretty much you stand in line forever, order, and go to the other counter by the exit to pay and then sit down or take the food to go. Oh there's a salsa bar or something too. Overall, eh. I don't recommend this place :( I'll stick with Taco bell lol...k Sad4Lyfe",

There was basically no wait for any of the lines when I went around noon which was surprising but I'm definitely not complaining.  I had the adobada and cabeza tacos - my usual - which tasted just as good as when I had them in California. My friend and I also split a half order of campechana fries, which had a nice balance of meat, cheese, and toppings. After eating 4 tacos I honestly don't know how I ate half the box of fries but it was so good and I've been deprived for so long so why not  \\_()_/   Seriously I have nothing but praise for this place.

Hubby and I had: - asada tacos  - al pastor tacos  - asada mulas (had no idea what it was, but everyone else ordered it)  - grilled green onions and peppers - horchata - orange bang  Asada tasted better than al pastor Mulas - tortilla, cheese, meat, gauc, and salsa  All the food was delicious!  Next time, we'll skip the drinks.  Cooking staff worked fast!  And mostly friendly.   Yes, I would come back!",

    "text": "My Las Vegas Foodcation had only three stops. Emeril's, Wynn Buffet, and Tacos El Gordo.  Tacos El Gordo was my friend Jorge's pick.  He kept going on and on about how great the tacos were.  He mentioned how they had these killer asada fries and how the tacos were authentic baja style.  So before we leave Vegas, the foodie brigade and I, (Rogelio, Jorge, and Blanca) make a stop at Tacos El Gordo.  This location was in a little strip mall and not in the best area on the Strip, but maybe that made the tacos better somehow.  As soon as you walk in the chaos hits you.  There are several lines and depending what you want to order, you stand in that line and order.  You get your food and then pay the cashier.  Figuring this out was hard, thank goodness for the adobada guy.  He took the time to explain it to me and even called me Chula.  He made sure he got my full order without having to stand in the other lines.  My friend took advantage of this and made me get his order to.  The food was delicious, but the stand out for me was the tacos de lengua.  I am really picky when it comes to eating lengua (tongue), but it was so juicy and delicious I had to go back in and order some more.  Although I had to wait a bit, the adobada guy chatted me up and remarked about how the tacos would taste just that much better after my wait.    Asada fries delicious...they have this really tasty creamy green salsa.  Tacos OUTSTANDING! oh and they have grilled green onions, jalapenos and chile gueritos...not the pickled variety but the yellow ones.  No one ever has those and those are my favorite.  I looked up other locations and there are several in and around San Diego.  Next time I'm in San Diego I'm going to look one up and will keep a look out for any popping up closer to home.",

The people making the tacos were pleasant to deal with. The location and condition of the building is not the greatest. In fact, it's really run down, and they don't have air conditioning, but if you can live with that, the tacos are delicious.",

The meat is super tender and well seasoned and the prices are very affordable, great for people on a budget in Vegas. The service was good and fast, there was a bit of a line when we showed up but they served us fairly quickly! The overall quality of the food was excellent! Only thing we didn't like was the fact that they charge the same for a flour mula as they do a corn mula ( the corn one is twice as small) and the lay out of the restaurant. Other than that it was awesome!!!",

This is a quick service operation where you line up in front of the station that is serving your taco of choice then you pay at the register. Additional condiments to are available near the drink stand. The sodas include horchata and cream sodas. We were there around 2am on a Monday and the line was very reasonable at about 10 minutes for both the tacos and register. They have plenty of seating options both indoors and outside. The location sits at the top of the strip just north of the Wynn and walking distance from Circus Circus and Rivera.",

    "text": "A pleasant surprise!! My wife and I visit Las Vegas quite frequently and had decided to try a new place to eat that was recommended to her by a work colleague. However, she could not remember the name...only the general location. While walking on the strip looking for this particular eatery (which turned out to be the Peppermill that was a block up), we stumbled across Tacos El Gordo. A small hole in the wall place in front of a strip mall. The aroma of carne that filled the air and the amount of people that were going in and coming out immediately caught our attention. Since we were unable to find our original destination, we contemplated whether or not we should try this place. We were a little skeptical at first, not knowing what to expect since its surroundings were a far cry from the Wynn/Encore where we had just come from. But my wife had checked on Yelp and surprisingly it got great reviews, so we figured what the heck! And boy, did it not disappoint!! My wife had gotten the soft tacos and I had the sopes. I could not believe my taste buds after the first bite! Amazing!! Mind you, I know Mexican food from my background and where I live, and this is the real deal. This is authentic, not gringo Mexican that you would think would be on the Las Vegas strip. Plus they have a variety of taco meats to choose from. And the prices? Extremely reasonable...a couple of bucks each. It was so good and inexpensive, we took my parents and and their local friends days later and they also agreed...delicious cheap eats!  This is definitely one of our new \"go-to\" places when in Vegas.",

The tacos al pastor are authentic, I don't care how much you think you know by going to places around the world and having the best tacos this place is good and original. This place started in Tijuana and moved to San Diego and is booming in Vegas. I live in the high desert and think about taking of to Vegas just grab some tacos all the time. If your going to Vegas on a budget don't go but if you end up going hit this place up. Don't forget to ask for some grilled onions and chiles and burnt tostada all that is complimentary.",

To pay is at the other end of the restaurant.  I'm basic so my order was a carne asada taco with their avocado sauce layered with some other red sauce below it. I also ordered a carne asada quesadilla.  It was not what I'm accustomed to. They warmed up the taco size flour (I choose flour, corn was the other option) tortilla with cheese on the grill. Once done then layered a good size portion of carne asada followed by the red sauce and avocado sauce , last was a very crispy taco size tortilla.  I was confused as it was not the typical quesadilla I'm use to receiving at other Mexican restaurants. I just took the top part off and ate it like a taco. Basically, I had a taco but paid $2.00 more for a quesadilla.  There are no burritos which is odd, I would have loved to have a burrito from there. Love the food here, it's worth the very long wait as I hear usually is the norm for this spot. We lucked out and had one two people a head of us. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be returning here!",

This beats anything else on the strip when it comes to late night quality fast food, authentic, a little expensive in comparison to your average taqueria but ultimately worth it.",

Kinda expensive for a  tho. $2.25 or was it $2.50(I'm not sure )I know it's located on the strip that's y, but no excuses..hehe.   For 9  they only give u 3 hot sauces (which is in the fridge) behind the cashier.. if u want extra it's   50cent.. it's limited hot sauce everywhere else.. gotta complaint!!

Luckily, there was no line and we ordered our food immediately! You basically go to different sections to order the type of meats you want. After waiting in line and getting your meats, you go to the cash register to pay for everything.  I got al pastor, spicy pork adobo, and carne asada tacos. I also ordered the lengua quesadilla, and I got my food quickly. The lengua quesadilla is pretty small- it's barely larger than a corn tortilla. However, the lengua was so tender and soft, and I love the cheese, crispy tortilla, and toppings that go on the quesadilla! The spicy pork adobo was full of flavor, and the other meats were bomb as well! Don't forget to ask for spicy sauce at the cash register as it is the cherry to the icing!  Prices are extremely reasonable and food was so good. The guys working the meats know what they're doing and work quickly to accomodate towards their guests. Can't decide between 4 or 5 stars... but I will be back to check for consistency!",

    "text": "Most legitimate tacos, ever!  It's effectively the same tacos that you get from a taco truck, in a restaurant. However, taco trucks tend to be a bit cheaper by a few cents per taco. For a grown adult, roughly 4 tacos can fill you up, which is about $8 without drinks.   I do not recommend the Taco De Sesos! Thats beef brain tacos. And it smells funny, and tastes like... unflavored tofu or something. And I hate tofu.   But everything else is great! I don't know what that green sauce is, but I see little onion bits in it. Whenever possible, request more green stuff on your tacos!  The neighborhood around is sort of shady, the shopping center where this one is located is surrounded by liquor stores and smoke shops. However! It is a better spot than the 2nd location on Charleston, which is surrounded by bail bonds and pawn shops.   The people that work here can speak a limited amount of English, so for people that want to practice their Spanish, remember this line...  \"Yo quiero _______ tacos de _______\"  Where the first blank is the number (uno, dos, tres, quattro, cinco, etc.) and the second blank is the type of taco. Carne for example, means beef, and etc. You can just read it off the menu.",

Each kind of taco has its own line, so if you want different meats and are by yourself, you're screwed, or even if you have 1 other person with you and want several different meats, you're still screwed.  Also, they put guacamole on the tacos, which drowns out the taste of the tacos. I've been to Mexico many times and they don't do that there. California also has a large Mexican population and they don't do that at most places. Some places put chunks of avocados, but not guacamole.  Maybe these are 4 or 5 star tacos for Nevada, but these are jus average for me. In the SF Bay area tacos are much better, as we are highly populated with Mexican immigrants who make good tacos.",

    "text": "Prepare yourself for an uncomfortable time!  The food here is really good, but the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired.  First off, they have a chaotic system of ordering food on one side, then paying on the other side of the room.  It's not a common setup, and it seems you have to be a bit pushy to order your food.  People here seem to ignore you, or people cut in front of you.  It seems either people have bad manners or this restaurant has employees who only respond positively to other spanish speakers.  It could also be that my friend isn't the pushy rude type, but the people taking orders wouldn't acknowledge him.    I think it's tragic that even though the food is pretty good, but the organization really sucks!  If you want one type of meat, you stand in one line, if you want another, then you have to stand in a different line.  They had 4 different lines!  I wish they would just handle orders in the back.  It's as if they think their employees are too dumb to handle orders of different types of meat.  He might mix up the carne asada with the adobada!  They look totally different, but who cares, my employees are too stupid to tell the difference!   I really don't get it.  I might expect this sort of chaos at a food truck or an outdoor swap meet, but in a restaurant there's a much better way of running things.  It's not like the way they have things setup makes things faster or easier.  In fact, I could see someone easily ordering food and just walking out without paying because it would be impossible to tell who's paid and who hasn't especially when it is busy which it seems to be  during lunch and dinner hours.  I also found the prices to be a bit high in light of how terrible the service runs.  I'd understand paying more for food in a restaurant that is organized and nice, but with all the chaos and terrible service, I don't know why I\"d pay any more than any taco truck.  Overall I'd say stay away unless you find the place mostly empty, then it wouldn't take you forever to order your food.  Also your choices are pretty much taco, tostada, sopa, and carne fries.",

To the point where I've started calling myself a \"tacotarian.\" (And yes, I know they make fish tacos, I just don't care.)  So on my latest trip to Tacos El Gordo, I decided to branch out and try their vegetarian option - to see if I could keep visiting my favorite Vegas taco joint even in the absence of meat.  The taco azteca (nopales asado) is strips of grilled cactus served on your choice of corn or flour tortilla with salsa and guacamole. The cactus really had a nice snap when you bite into it and a bit of a peppery flavor. A lot of times with vegetarian options for Mexican it feels like you're \"missing\" something. A vegetarian burrito from Chipotle feels like a magic trick sometimes. And not in a good way.  But this was legit. If I ever pull the trigger and go full-on vegetarian, this will be a staple of my diet.  (The adobada is still amazing too.)",

Can't get any better than this when you had a few drinks with the company of wonderful people/family & an appetite for really good food after drinking for a few hours :) Totally worth the drive regardless which part of town you live at even for visitors!!  I always get everything on it especially the pineapple slice with the spicy pork taco!",

    "text": "One tell tale sign of a restaurants authenticity is when people in their own community support it.  Tex mex is so popular, and luckily for us Tacos El Gordo serves up truly legit Mexican.  Outdoor and indoor seating is available, but when you are from Canada and you have the opportunity to dine outdoors in March, you take it.  The ordering process is slightly confusing.  Upon walking in to the restaurants, there is a cashier, and you would think that you pay first and then order, wrong.  Instead you go in the designated line, for steak, pork, etc, order, and then you pay.  It is amazing to watch the food be completely prepared for you form scratch in minutes.  On your way to pay, their is an additional toppings bar that was stocked with limes, radish, etc.  We ordered 6 tacos and paid $12 for two people, where most of the fancy restaurants on the strip that is the price one cocktail.  I am a self admitted taco snob, just because i have had so many legit tacos.  These tacos rate up their with some of the best.  They come on corn or flour, but for me their is only one option, corn is a must.  For the carne asada, the meat was tender, and they chop and cook it on the flat top seconds before putting it on a tortilla with onions, herbs, and guacamole.  It had so much flavour without being too hot, it was extremely fresh, my one complaint was that there was too much guacamole.  The pork taco again had so much flavour  from the cilantro, it tasted so bright, and with a squeeze of lime i was totally satisfied.  Both tacos had a good base of extremely flavourful meat, they didnt need to be topped with a million ingredients to make them taste great, they were simple, authentic, and boasting with flavour.  Overall i loved Tacos El Gordo, they make a lot of las vegas residents and tourists happy with an amazing product that they dish out hundreds of times daily.  My only complaint was the whole ordering process, the cashier was helpful, but i am sure she tires of telling people where to line up.  One suggestion would be more signage.  I cannot wait for my next visit, i might be more adventurous next time.",

No I have not travel the world but nothing will change this claim. Whats my favorite? Try one of everything, I'm sure you cant decide. Tacos are a little more than what you can get in LA but its all worth it. My first time here, I was told to try their Abodabo meat. It reminded me of spicy Korean pork. Which I like but I prefer to stick to  carne asada, buche and tripa. The place is pretty well kept, clean and organized. If ever in Vegas, this is a must!!!!!",

I've never had this place in the california area but only heard good things about it.  Definitely not the most healthiest place to eat at but a good price for tasty food. (think the pork fat / oil is used to cook the tacos hence the taste. It was actually a lot smaller than I thought just from looking at the pictures but 4-5 of them filled me out.   Seems the adobada is most popular. There are multiple lines as well for what you want to order. There are 2 sets of these lines if they are opened. Also it seems if you line up for one you can still order from the line next to you and skip the line (someone can correct me if I am wrong). I just saw people doing it which seemed to be locals.  I'm surprised this place is quite slow though. The wait for adobada took 30 minutes, atleast.  I would still come here again but not much selection for the vegetarian eaters and the veggie options were not that great as I was told. Can try Komol Restaurant for veggie eaters.",

I'm sure you can go up and ask for them.  The asada tacos were not bad, just dry and really in need of sauce. The bbq pork was not my favorite. It comes in two corn tortillas because of the wetness and grease.   I'd like to try the chorizo or quesidilla  next time as it looked good.   There's limes and radishes (whole and sliced) for you to choose from.   5 tacos and tostados were $12 not bad...would come back. I want to try the lengua but wished the line was shorter...",

If I could eat these every day for the rest of my life and not get fat(..ter) I DEFINITELY WOULD.  They freshly shave the grilled spicy pork off of the rotating stack and sprinkle it onto perfectly crispy french fries topped with fresh FRESH guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. Equally delicious whether sober or highly intoxicated. The small size is more than enough for one person.   Oh and they close at 3 AM and will not let you in after that time. :( make sure you get there before then so you don't have to resort to Denny's.",

Dislike there is a different line for the kind of meat you want or if you want something besides tacos. And then another line to pay. I got my fries super quick and my hubby waited 20 min in line for adobo tacos. Then another line to pay, which by the time you sit down the food can get cold. AND there is no seating, people have to stand by to fight over a table. The end.",

The specialty is the pastor, the creamy green sauce, and the pineapple. Together they make a beautiful combo of succulent meat with the sweetness of the pineapple. There are so many flavor combinations with all the salsa!   You have to ask for the pineapple separately or else they won't give it.  The pastor fries were ok. The meat was good but the fries were soggy and overall bland. Don't recommend. Come for just the tacos!",

    "text": "***4.5 stars***  I could honestly just say...try these damn tacos, but that's no fun.  Tacos El Gordo has only a select few locations, which are Vegas, San Diego and Tijuana (might have missed some but these are the main locations everyone talks about). It's nice that this place stays open pretty late so the late night munchies is a must here.   We arrived around 4:30pm and the line was ridiculous. They have a weird ordering system here where you have to get in line for each individual taco meat that you want. For example, if you want Asada you'll to wait in the Asada line. After receiving those tacos you'll have to get in another line for any other meats you want. If you're with a group of people, it's easy to split up and have one person order a few tacos in each line to share with everyone.   El Gordo's has a wide range of meats from Al Pastor, Asada, Abodaba (spicy pork), Lengua (beef tongue), and etc. We ordered 10 tacos between my bf and I. We decided on pastor and Asada. Sitting there watching them cut the pastor on the skewer was mesmerizing.   Taste test time. We both agreed that the asada was one of the best we've ever had. Everything from the home made tortilla to the guacamole was amazing and fresh.   I wish we had more time to explore the menu however first impressions last a life time. We will definitely be coming back.",

Also, you can take the Deuce and get off at a close stop.   They only have one line at this location, which is nice because you can try the different tacos easier. I love the adobada (remember to add pineapple). The carne asada is good too. Their tacos are still extremely cheap even though they're on the strip. Also, the drinks are cheap. I had to get some horchata. But, they don't have any orange bang.  The also have fries at this location.   Overall, this is very similar to the Tacos El Gordo locations in San Diego. However, they are a bit more sloppy with the taco construction and they only gave me one small slice of pineapple on my adobada tacos when they usually give me an entire plate of pineapple in San Diego.   If you want some amazing food. Come here. Writing this review made my mouth water. Mmmmmm. Tacos El Gordo.",

They've got limes and sliced/whole raddish to dress these already perfect tacos.   They've got plenty beverages as well! 3 tacos and a pineapple soda is the perfect meal before hitting the strip.

However, the way it is designed for customers to order their food is different and can be confusing for some. So let me break it down for you, upon walking you may see different lines, you may asked why? Well each line serves different type of meats. So, make sure you read the signs before making line. Also, when you pay, the cashier will be on the back corner. From many taco joints I have been to the price is not bad. The quality of the food is what matters the most and its pretty darn good. Just to make it clear, this was the first time I ever been here, so it's not as bad as other reviewers make it seem.   TIPS: IF you do not like waiting, this may not be your place. IF you like everything to be handed to you THIS may not be your place (You may have to read some signs inside to make sure you are in the right lane to order) IF you do not want to be around a lot of people, this may not be your place. IF you like you do not want to wear nothing, but some jeans on because you feel that you have an Abercrombie model body, THIS MAY NOT BE YOUR PLACE.   ALL jokes aside, be realistic and try them out. They are worth the try!",

My wife and I shared a quartet of adobada street tacos, but the norm this day seemed to be 6 per person. Our tacos were good though not as filled as in the past, but that may be an anomaly attributable to new staff. We also shared a horchata that was heavy on Mexican cinnamon - that's good.",

I don't think they're 40 min wait good... The lines are usually crazy and chaotic so be prepared.  They do have a nice variety of meats for a fast food type of joint. They have options like chicken, steak, beef shoulder, tongue, brain and spicy pork. The spicy pork is the best! Those are 4*.",

As well as refer a lot of tourists to try the real deal of the Mexican street taco.   Unfortunately, I had unpleasant racial experience on the evening of Thursday, January 28th 2016 around midnight. I had brought in a best friend of over 30 years & his wife to experience this place. Only to be pleasant to the whole staff including the security guard, Miguel with a badge & gun, which made my guests feel uncomfortable. My racial experience though was the big lady, Lela, who cooks the onions & peppers. She had the nerve to try to skip me to place an order & call me a white faggot in espanol after I tipped everyone after putting in my order. We didn't want make a scene but she did. She refused to offer me any of the cooked onions or peppers. The staff has changed for the worse. I used to be greeted on a  nice professional basis. Now I'm being called names with racial condensending remarks.  Other than that the food is GREAT.  Can't say as much for the staff. Especially when they are catering to various clients from around the world. Also they need to put some smiles on their faces.  My apologies to Miguel, the owner, & Natalie for having to report this but maybe this will help make changes for the better. For the time being I can not refer you business anymore. Also will let my other friends in the hospitality industry know of this incident & refer to other similar QSR concepts.",

Remember you are here to enjoy yourself and if you come here or to one of these places expecting a quesadilla you will be fooled and scammed into paying for something you did not order.

    "text": "Being a fan on Tacos el Gordo now, i wanted to try their Strip location, located a little north of the Wynn Casino. You may or may not pass it the first time but once you pass Wynn, and the little overpass (desert inn), there is a parking lot that leads to a Church . You can either park here (before Tacos el Gordo) or park in the lot after passing the restaurant. The restaurant itself faces Las Vegas Blvd, so not hard to spot it if you are looking for it.  Unlike the Charleston location, this location also has outdoor seating. Something different from the other location as well, they have double the amount of lines, but as you can probably guess.... this location can be MUCH MUCH busier. But if you want tongue/stomach, i think there is only ONE line for that (far right off to the side).   First time i came here, mid day, not really busy at all. Later few times, were in the evening, SUPER PACKED ! ! You'd think there was some sale or something !   Some people say the quality of their stuff is less than of the Charleston location. Meat quality, i think is the same. If you were to order fries, i've had varying experiences with that. Sometimes fresh out of the fryer, sometimes not.   My favorites to get is beef tongue, pork stomach. Super flavorful and something you usually dont get at your chain store Taco Bell (rarely go fast food anyway, esp not Taco Bell)  Good idea, if you are going with other people... is if you want different meats, have each person be in different lines and get the order. Otherwise, you'll be in line for a long long time...   Surprisingly, even the outdoor seating, there is always someone cleaning up. Great service ! Not like that was something i was looking for anyway, but it was a plus ! A lot of times, while sitting there after eating, and just talking, they'd come up and help us take our trays and trash away.   Good central location to go to if you live on the West or South side. Fairly easy to get to, unless the Strip is busy due to a holiday or weekend.",

    "text": "In my experiance the Las Vegas strip and inexpensive street food has never gone hand in hand. That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.  I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each.   Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds True here. The place is very clean.  Bottom line, Tacos El Gordo is the perfect spot for lunch or late night after boozing in a local casino, open until 3:00AM. One of my go to stops in Vegas. These dudes bang out seriously good chow!",

We didnt know that each line was a different meat so thank goodness I wasn't in the Lengua line.... had it (not from here) and dont want to try it again.   The tacos are small so if you are hungry get 3 or 4.  The people in front of me had about 5 people in their family and ordered about 30!!!  I kid you not!  So you know it was gonna be good!

Unfortunately, having had some great tacos in LA and south of the border, I can say they aren't quite top tier. That being said, they are one of the best taquerias in Las Vegas. I would come back, but if a King Taco ever opens in the city, there would be no contest.   Pros: -Good price, open late -Lengua and cabeza held their own; both were cooked well, moist, and flavorful, if a bit under-spiced -Their red sauce/salsa was great -\"insert meat choice\" fries  Cons -The adobada, which they are apparently known for, was chewy, dry, and pretty lacking in any flavor whatsoever (resembling styrofoam perhaps) -The ordering situation is, well, a situation.

I would definitely recommend the tacos adobada, probably some of the best I've ever had. It had a very interesting and robust flavor.  I didn't care too much for the carne asada tacos, they were a bit chewy and cold. Still delicious though.   The service was great and kind. I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again.",

    "text": "The price point is perfect! ~ $3 tacos depending on what kind of meat you order.  They offer all kinds of options (carne asada, brain, tongue, etc) - so you have to find the person serving the kind of meat you want and get in that particular line to place your order.  You'll have to ask which line has what because there are no signs.  .. and it's weird because even if you're first in line (and you're at the counter ready to place your order) - if someone next to you has a tray of food and is waiting to place an order, they actually get to order BEFORE YOU because Tacos El Gordo has to serve those with food on their tray first.. that's right, they get to order before you, even though you were in line first... Tsk, Tsk!  They don't have chicken (aka pollo) - so if you're not a red meat person this might not be the place for you.",

Their Spicy Pork fries are also a great choice, but I will suggest ordering half of a full size order because even their half size fries can feed about 2-3 people.  They also provide grilled peppers and green onions for free and they go great with just about anything you're eating at the place.    This place definitely is the best taco place in town!",

    "text": "After reading the reviews prior to arriving in Vegas I knew I just had to try this place.  Spicy pork tacos cut right from a giant hunk of meat that stares you in the face?!??!?! Uhhhh, yes please!  Went here around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and it was effing packed.  I knew it was a good sign when I saw a ton of Mexicans and a security guard packing a real gun.  Tacos are serious business!  I ordered 3 tacos.  I got the Adobada (spicy pork), lengua (tongue) and carne asada tacos.  All 3 tacos were very good, though I was probably the most disappointed with the adobada.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but there just wasn't a lot of meat in the taco.  The meat that was in there was good, but that particular taco looked a little sad.  I did enjoy the free guac topping on the carne asada taco.  The lengua was cooked very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed that taco as well.    All in all, I'd give this place a solid 4.5 stars.  If there was more adobada in my taco I would definitely give this place 5 stars.  It could've just been bad luck with that particular taco.    If you want good tacos, definitely try this place out.",

Upon entering this place, you better know what you want and where to get it because they will get you in and out ASAP. To the far left you got the adobado, middie is the carne asada and far right is the counter for brain, intestines, stomach, lengua (my favorite!!!). You can make about anything with the different types of meat. I tried the Carne Asada fries, carne asada taco, mula con adobado, tongue mula and adobado fries. I actually had a Tacos El Gordo Sandwich (what is this??)...which involves TWO visits to TACOS EL GORDO within a 9 hour time frame with my first and last meal of the day being at this establishment with some more foodie (Korean bbq) and Las Vegas show in between. Probably my most BIG GIRL night in a long time.   They also speak Spanish to you like you know Spanish. So brush up on your Spanish or get lost in translation. Drinks are $1.40 and there's only one size...BUT you get unlimited Ole drinks (mmmmz Orange Bang....). Indoor seating is scarce because they get filled up so quickly. Everyone wants to eat here at all times of the day, I swear. Never worked so hard to enjoy my food, but it's well worth it. If this place is too hectic for ya, try their other location off the strip approximately 3 miles away.  Anyhoo, I CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK! The food is delicious and everything else street Mexican is unacceptable now (unless someone proves me otherwise). Thanks for setting the standard Tacos El Gordo!",

You order your food then pay at the cashier. It's not the most organized place, but if you expected that then you were dreaming.  I'd say the tacos are the best deal at $2 because the are basic street tacos with onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole. The quesadilla and vampiro were small and double the price. The carne asada fries were huge, tasty, but the fries were a little cold and after a while everything tasted the same.  I can see why it's busy. The tacos are tasty.

Being that they are orginally from Tijuana, they are already off to a good start. Personally I am a huge fan of their carne asada and ablongida (sp.?) tacos. They also have more exotic delights as cabeza (head) lengua (tounge) and a few other goodies I have yet to try. Plus, their cane asada fries are nothing short of amazing in my mind.   And on top of all that great food, you can wash it down with unlimited refills of Orange Bang! Or Pina or horchata if that floats your boat as well.   Buenos timepos!",

I didn't know what to expect, but had heard rave reviews about the place from everyone and was terribly excited to finally try it for myself. The wait wasn't as bad as I had thought it'd be. My friend had ordered me two tacos--one carne asada and one al pastor. I'm the type of person who has the save the best for last, this also applies to the way I eat my food. I took one bite of the al pastor taco and it was delicious. I took one bite of the carne asada and it was even more delicious. Needless to say, I finished off with the carne asada, but gobbled both up quicker than you can take a breath.

    "text": "On my virgin trip to the City of Sin I only wasted away for 24 hours,  but two of my three life saving meals were at \"The Gordo\".  Discovered with the aid of Yelp,  I arrived for meal #1 around midnight after an evening of hotel pregaming before beginning my walk down the strip. Not having eaten since the Grand Canyon 12 hours ago, my dire need of sustinence was cloaked until arriving by the alcohol previously ingested.  As soon as I read the menu, my jaw dropped in wonder how such a popular spot could crank out the oddities offered.  Well, when in vegas...  There was no written indication as to which lines were for each cut (pork, beef, or specialty cuts), so I stood in line for abodaba for 10 minutes before speaking with a rep.  *Left is beef, middle is pork, and right is specialty cuts.* When relocated to the correct line, the chef would reach under a steaming towel to select and cut each cut of meat made to order.  This line isn't the fastest, but totally worth it.  Out of the corner of my eye there was an older woman hand packing corn tortillas out of fresh corn meal.  Talk about made to order.  The first night I got the cabeza, sesos, and beef shoulder.  I'm not gonna pretend to be qualified to judge these cuts, but I found the cabeza to be flavorful with a very soft texture, and the sesos were creamier than I have had in the past.  The beef shoulder alone merited my return the next night!  All of these tacos on corn tortillas were served with light lettuce, onion, and salsa verde relishes.  This surprise of an experience lured us back for a quick dinner the next evening when I chowed on more shoulder, abodaba, and tripe.    For being on the strip, this place is a hidden gem.  Good, cheap food on the strip is hard to come by, and authentic $2 tacos are tough to beat anywere.  The lack of English can be disguising and my gf and I were the only gringos in there (other than the officers on a meal break - they know where to eat and that's always a good sign).  Spanish as a second language paid off in Vegas!",

There are no words to describe how flavorful the tacos are, you just need to try it to understand. Plus, it is so affordable! Skip the fast food and choose this instead.

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo. We have been planning a trip to Las Vegas for 6 months. So far most of what we have done has been great. We had to try Tacos El Gordo since we are mexican =). Well, I have to agree with most of the reviews. The way to order tacos is a mess.  I can see why they do it the way they do. Sopes are made a certain way, Tacos al Pastor come from a certain grill, Lengua, cesos from a certain bash and so on.....   With that said the lines are horrible. This place is in such high demand that they need to put up more of these in Las Vegas Strip area. We were in line for tacos about 30 minutes, and it was only one line.  Me and my wife had 4 Suadero, 2 Cesos, 1 Lengua, and 1 Cabeza. They were DELICIOUS!. The meat was cooked to perfection.......  I cannot say the staff was at fault because all of them from the servers behind the line to the ladies cleaning tables (well... cleaning as best they could because tables were never empty more than 1 minute) were working their a$$3s off.   I would have easily rated this 5 stars but the wait to get tacos and the wait to pay was a real inconvenience.   TIP: as soon as you are next to order tacos and your party is more than one, send another member to the pay line to save you time. If more than two, have another save you a table!!!  LOL, worth the wait!",

I don't know how they do it, but they are consistent every time.   I always order the tacos Al Pastor with everything on it! Thee most incredible flavor in a taco you will ever try! It doesn't matter how packed the place is late at night, they are quick, consistent, and above all very friendly people! Ask for the grilled veggies too!

Better brush up on that Spanish, else you might be in for quite a bit of \"I want that\" pointing to the workers who barely speak a lick of English.  Most people come here for the spicy adobada, but my favorite is the lengua tacos--the fattest, juiciest lengua tacos ever. You can also request grilled jalapenos and green onions at no charge.  The set up is a bit confusing if you've never been. There's a separate line for each type of meat. The lengua/cabeza is all the way to the right, the adobada is the long line you see, and the asada is to the left. You order, then bring your order to the cashiers to pay.  Open until the wee hours because you know you're going to need drunk food in Vegas.",

With my homeboy always (usually) behind the counter, the service is always friendly, and this became the go to quick dinner spot for virtually all my friends coming here for their pregame dinner (which often led to the round 2 trip, post game drunken snack). While I almost always got the pastor here, both the chicken and steak are good quality and I'm partial to the Costillas en Res con Papas (sp?) You'll see a picture of it on the menu, love the grilled jalapeno.  Short story long, and not just because I have more than a few drunken (and sober) memories, but this is by far my favorite pastor in the city and I will always keep coming back!",

The interior of the place is surprising clean. The place also offers inside and outside seating, more than likely you'll eat inside cause it's either boiling hot or goosebumps cold outside.  Ordering the food was confusing at first only because you're greeted by the register as you come in. But just go up to any of the workers, order, go back to the cashier, and feast on your food. The prep time for food is miniscule only time you would have to wait is if you order fries.  From your first bite you can tell the quality of the food is far beyond any regular ole taco place. The sauce & adobado just go so damn well together. But to me the main star of this place are their adobado fries. THAT THING IS SERIOUSLY PACKED. Guac overload!!!!! The fries crispy, the cheese cheesy, the sour cream & guac perfect amount, and the avocado on top? Equivalent to a cherry on a ice cream.   Personally the price of the taco's a ripoff. But the price for the fries a steal.  PRO TIP! You can call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait in the long lines!  If anything could change in this place, it'd be for them to add heaters in their outside seating, it's just too cold out to eat outside.",

The lines when we got there on Sunday at 1 was crazy but by the time we got our food and finished eating at 2:15 the line was just at the door.   The restaurant has a interesting setup in that different lines serve only certain types of meat.  So the spicy pork is in a different line from the carne asada.  The tacos are typical small sized and most guys in our group had about 6-7 and I had 9.   My Favs: Spicy Pork Lengua - tender but still has that tongue texture  Decent: Carne Asada - a bit dry and not as much flavor Cabeza - slightly on the fatty side imo Tripe Suadero - too salty  Didn't like: Pork Shoulder - I thought it was too salty and the meat was dry Carne Asada fries",

If you are a first timer study the boards ahead of time, each station / person has a different meat selection, you want steak it's at one station, pork, it's at another, study those giant menu boards before you walk up!  A must stop when in Vegas and looking for a quick snack...hit Red Rock and hike for a hour or two then get back to the strip and order 4 tacos, it balances out (ha)!  I have only tried the steak and pork so I can only vouch for those, next trip I will branch out and try the others.....except the veggie taco that is!",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars.   My gf mentioned this place so we decided to check it out on Sunday before we headed back to LA. Parking is pretty big and the line was even bigger. Menu is pretty simple. Interesting was that the line forms in 4- 5 different sections. If you want pork then there's a line section just for pork, And same for beef and so on. It can get a little hectic and kind of sucks because you have to keep getting in different lines just to get a  few things. The pork line was pretty fast, my gf waited in the beef line for at least 30 min or more.   _Taco de Adobadas (spicy pork taco $2.00) the most popular and the BEST! They slice the pork real thin right in front of you. The pork isn't too spicy but just enough flavor. The green sauce gives it a nice little kick and sweetness. Add some lime on top and it's the perfect bite. I could have had 3 of these.. oops already happened! _Taco de Asada. (steak taco $2.00) I'm never a huge fan of beef taco because normally the beef comes out dry, But I thought this place may be different. Turns out I was right. The beef was a bit dry and after eating the pork taco the beef just did not cut it for me. I wish they added more guacamole sauce. _Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder $2.00) The beef shoulder was a bit juicier than the steak taco.  I would pick this over the Asada but still the Pork is the best! _Carne Asada fries ($10) huge portion. We shared this with myself and 3 other girls. It can get quite heavy and rich but so hard to put the fork down. I would do the Adobadas fries instead.  _Adobadas Tostada. ($2.00) This was pretty good. The crunch factor from the tortilla was nice and the pork was again amazing!   I would come here again just for the spicy pork taco and would like to try their sopes. I'm more of a fish taco person so don't go all crazy on me on my rating :) BTW great place to eat after a hangover.",

The horchata is delicious. Lines get pretty long. Read the signs... Don't get in the wrong line. We ate in the car because all the seats were occupied in the restaurant. I loved the tortillas, yellow corn tortillas - my fave! Very decent prices I must add!!",

There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.    The best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.    Tacos El Gordo is right off of the strip so its really easy to find.  Parking can be a little difficult at times because it just gets so crowded on the strip.",

I assume if you have been drinking and throw up after eating at this place you will think it's because of the drinking, it's most likely food poisoning from this place. After an IV, two shots of nausea medicine in my IV to control my throwing up, bloodwork, urine test and CT scan to look at my intestines, I was diagnosed with FOOD POISONING FROM TACOS El GORDO. It's now Dec. 22 and now it's just tons of diarrhea and the cramping, with a heating pad on my stomach. The hospital gave me meds for nausea and stomach pain.

    "text": "Took us about 45 minutes from arriving to get our food. Parking lot can get full quickly with the Korean BBQ place right next to it. Place was packed, with a line out the door for carne asada. If you wanted anything else than that then you get to cut the line. I waited in line to order food while my bf staked out a seat. We ended up sitting directly next to others since the tables were arranged pushed together to save space.  I was confused as how to pay, so here it is. You order and get your food, then you take it to the cashier and pay and get any drinks. Pretty smart. Oh and they don't have sauce... I would have killed for some green sauce on my food.  Food:  1. Carne asada fries: I love the cheese. Added a lot of flavor. We sprinkled limes and mixed the guac around to make a type of spread. The fries were good even after they stopped being warm so that's a super plus! ($13) 2. Carne asada tacos: pretty good! I ordered it with everything on there and they were the best part of the meal. ($2.25/each) 3. Carne asada sope: i love my sopes. So when you substitute cheese for rice and beans...... I'm not having it. It was really dry and I wouldn't have it again. Also had that with everything on top. ($4.50) 4. Horchata: from the machine. I like it haha. It was missing the cinnamon sand so I would recommend it! ($1.75)  If you want chilies and onion, ask for it. Or else they won't give it to ya!",

We've been here many times and for us the best time to go is mid afternoon on a weekday. Otherwise, the place is so packed.

This place is nearly Always crowded at literally all hours of the day but the tacos and fries are ridiculously good. The carne asada is legit, al pastor is awesome and the adobada is off the charts. The tacos are great but the adobada fries are well worth several return visits. This is my go to late night Mexican spot in Vegas and it being within close walking distance to the Wynn and Encore make it a must visit each time I'm in town.   Legit- Great tacos  Nice meat selection  Friendly staff  Adobada fries  Large portions  Walking distance to Encore   Meh- Really crowded  Long waits Very messy and likely not all that sanitary",

I wouldn't know cause there was no line when I went at 10PM on a Thursday night. 3. Adobada fries were on point. But the guacamole in it... not so much. What happened there?  Location: Just a bit out from Wynn. But walking distance, really.   Overall, if you're staying on the Strip, it's one of the best (and cheapest) options on the strip. If you need some munchies or are straight up craving, it's definitely worth it for the tacos alone. And much more convenient than driving out to the other Vegas location. All in all, can't go wrong with Tacos El Gordo!",

    "text": "Probably one of the worst taco places ever. I will keep this short and full of tips. Tip #1 avoid this place. The only PRO here is the meat. Everything else is subpar at best and negligent somewhere in the middle. If you are from California, this will be a fucking great disappointment for you.   If you still want to go there after reading this far, I got some useful tips below:  Tl;DR avoid corn tortilla tacos and fries. Guac is shit. Get vampiros or mula. Idk about the rest. Go at night and take a time machine. The food looks alot better. I went at 4 and it was shitty. Most of the good looking pics looks like it was night time and in 2015.  1. DO NOT get the TACOS. The taco tortillas are shitty as fuck and are from a bag. They make tortillas in front of you to make it look like all of it is fresh, they are not. It looks like they only use those fresh tortillas for the Vampiros and mula. These two were alright. If you really want tacos, ask for flour tortillas shit. Their corn tortillas are like fucking sand paper.  2. Fuck these fries. are you fucking kidding me? $15 for that small ass serving of lengua fries? This place charges twice as much as any place I have ever been to for fries. The fucking guacamole.... Holy shit it looks and taste like it is out of a tub of shit. If it taste like shit, looks like shit, is it shit? so disappointed with the guacamole here. This is a fucking disgrace. Fuck this shit. Stay away.  3. Horchata is shit. Don't get it.  4. I had to ask this fucking white looking fat lady to get salsa from her. With $60 worth of food for my fat ass I ask for salsa and she gives me fucking 2 tiny ass cups. I asked for 8 more because I have so much food, she says no. Then she starts talking shit about me in spanish in front of me like I don't fucken understand her. Fuck this bitch. Then I was like are you fucking serious? And she gives me the salsa. Fucking people man. I doubt I'll go back.  Well so much for a short review. Thanks for reading my rant and I hope it will be better for you if you decide to go there.",

Everything I've ever tried here is so BLAND!  The only redeeming thing about this place is when you see the little, old Mexican ladies making the tortillas in front of you. Having said that, I grew up on the Texas/Mexico border. Every taco shop on the border does that.  Don't get me wrong. The tacos here aren't awful, but they're certainly not worthy of four or even three stars. My guess is that most of the people who gave this place a good rating were a little drunk when they ate the food.) The location is two seconds from Wynn.) If you're sober and want good tacos, go somewhere else. You're welcome.",

Tacos are overpriced here in Las Vegas $2.25 each vs. $1.15 in Tijuana.  The taste is almost similar . Here is the worse part, the amount of meat they put in these tacos is half of what we get in Tijuana. However they are not stingy on onions & cilantro  even if you say \"little bit\" half of the taco is onion & cilantro. So in Vegas I'm paying twice as much, for half of a taco .  It satisfies my craving but I rather go to the original location. Parking is hard because it's all shared by 1 shopping center.",

The carne asada fries were good but I've definitely had better. It was missing pico!! If it had it on there, I think it would have been a lot better. The tacos were SUPER good. I wish I got more and these tacos are only $2 each! (and it comes with guac!).   It's kinda at the edge of the strip right after Encore, but don't worry because there are tons of people still walking around at 2 or 3 am! (:  *CASH ONLY!",

Well, you have the choice of 1) spending more money on food at the restaurants inside either hotel or 2) head a little further down The Strip and get your taco on here. I'm sure the latter is a much better choice. My friends never tuned me on to this until now (thanks a lot, guys! *sarcasm*). Made sure I made the most out of my first visit and got 3 tacos: lengua, asada, and adobada. All of them paired up with a large Horchata made it the best late night grub I've had in Vegas. Ever. It's probably saying a mouthful (and no, I kept classy and had those tacos one at a time), but it's True.",

Highly recommend any of the tacos and the agobada fries is a must!!  The fries couldn't be any better. They were crispy, covered with plenty of guac and sour cream, and topped with the fresh cut pork right off of the spinning pole. I don't know how to explain the uniqueness of the meat, but it was kind of a hybrid of bacon and cha siu (chinese pork). It was crispy like bacon and flavorful like cha siu. omgiwantsomemore!",

They had a line for each type of meat and one line for asada and quesallillas any meat with a clearly sign, in which they refuse to serve a  cabeza quesadilla . Even if you go with a lot of people and send one person to each line it is not fast enough. An employee refuse to give us onions and salsa, said ask for it at the cashier on your way out, OK we paid or our food with hand written notes given to us by the servers and ask for our salsa we were told we should get them from the server go back yo the line again, we said this is not game make up your mind, we were there, ask for it and it was denied. The cashier went to the line and got it for us because we refuse to go back. The system is not too complicated, but most people there are visitors and if their own coworkers dont know it or refuse to follow it how do you spect new comers to know it. We paid 200 dollars in tacos that weren't that good . The buffet is a better and cheaper option. We live in Cali we have tacos on every corner, i know about tacos I'm a taco expert in my opinion Tacos el gordo might be the best tacos on vegas, but not even close the best I had. the bad experience  and waste of time is not worth it.",

This was so tragic that it took out a piece of my soul and I actually was way less excited to go to Vegas again...  ...but lo, the powers that be have put this place back on the map. It hasn't skipped a beat.  Tacos El Gordo doesn't make any sense. Delicious, nearly flawless, incredibly cheap tacos served almost in the shadow of Wynncore. Things on the strip shouldn't be so delicious while being so cheap because it feels like there's a scam somewhere.  Anyhow, the chorizo and asada tacos are banging. The meat is cooked so tenderly and so perfectly. It's spiced so perfectly. You can get full for like 8 dollars. This shit is psychotic and I'm so, so happy that this is a viable Vegas dining option once more.",

The shop is on the far north end of the strip, it's in an awkward location that either forces you to work hard for your meal (it's a loooooong walk from most of the casinos) or forces you to drive. The lot is pretty big and parking has never been an issue for me. The line during the day is either non-existent or extremely short. Come here at night when all the post-clubbing munchers come in and you'll have a line out the door.  There are multiple lines based on what type of meat you're ordering. The 4 lines facing you at the main entrance are where you'll probably want to be at (unless you plan on ordering tongue or intestines- the line for that is on the other side).  AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. AL PASTOR. It's the line at the far right. Start there, order 3 tacos and if you're still hungry order more AL PASTOR. The meat is so soft and flavored perfectly. If you're feeling to try something else, go for the asada.  The tongue and intestines were both extremely soft and juicy. I loved the tongue, didn't like the intestines.  Grab your plate and head to the register by the door. They have drinks behind the counter if you want some.",

    "text": "1 dollar sign, average 4+ stars, and a ton of reviews makes for a must-see/must-try especially in a land of high rollers and expensive buffets.  Also, I just really like tacos.  My friends and I came in at around 2:00 PM on a Sunday, and the place was PACKED still.  There's even a bouncer (armed too) who directs entry as space permits. When you're finally in, you have to stand in a certain line based on what you would like to order; in other words, certain lines are strictly for certain items on the menu.  Hence, you gotta plan ahead and think about who will go in which line.  Honestly, it's pretty inconvenient imo because some lines are longer than others.  The food doesn't take long to prep, but it took a while overall for our group to get all of our food.    We ordered a wide variety of tacos (adobada, carne asada, and lengua), adobada fries, and carne asada fries (I know I know...I judge me too).  They were all really good, but anything adobada (spicy pork) was my favorite.  The adobada fries were freaking nuts: just imagine the most epic nachos but fries instead of nachos.        On a side note, the lines completely died down at around 2:30.  Womp.  I've been going back and forth between 4 stars and 5 stars b/c of the weird/inconvenient ordering process, but 5 stars it is.    because adobada.",

You order first, get your goods and then pay. The grilled onions go great with the tacos. The adobada is BOMB.  Spiced pork - mmmm!

Otherwise, you'll be stuck standing in several lines.   Food - A M A Z I N G! Need I say more? I had the al pastor, carne and cabeza taco! I enjoyed them most in the order listed. While the carne and cabeza we're good, the al pastor was faaaaaar more superior. I also had the adobada mula which was good but a bit difficult to eat. Overall the mula was just ok. Although the adobada meat was really flavorful and tasty, def a close second!  Once you're done getting all your food, there is a separate line to pay at the cashier.   The place is quite busy so swoop on an open table if you get the opportunity!",

Finally I got to try it after waiting for perhaps an hour (that's where it's minus a star) but honestly I would say the al pastor is worth it.  We ordered I think 4 carne asada tacos, 4 al pastor tacos, and carne asada fries. Make sure to ask for pineapples for the al pastor tacos!! Otherwise they pretty much got you on covering your tacos in sauce. The al pastor is really delicious and I regret not getting more because the carne asada smelled and tasted burnt which really ruined the experience for me. I wouldn't order the carne asada again because it was burnt on the tacos and the fries. Make sure to get limes and radishes too.  The entire place is bustling and busy and it's extremely hard to get seating but just hustle and you should be able to get seats. It's super cramped and hard to walk but it's honestly pretty good. I would come back for the al pastor!!",

    "text": "If you happen to drive down The Strip and pass Encore, it is likely that you will see a line out the door from some mysterious store front. That, my friends, is the throng of people waiting to get their hands on some authentic Mexican tacos. Tacos El Gordo doesn't have much competition in the area so it is natural to see hordes of people crowding their 3 Vegas locations.  TIP: There are separate lines for tacos. There is normally someone standing at the door to direct people to the appropriate lines but if you're like me and tend to order the unique meats e.g. Cabezza, Buche, Lengua, make sure to go inside and go to the line on the furthest right (closest to the bathroom). It's always the shorter line. If you're looking to order a bit of everything, those lines will typically be the longest. There are also 2 lines if you're looking to order the Adobada, which is El Gordo's version of the al pastor.   Their meats are some of the most tender I've ever had but when it lacks flavor, you're just eating flavorless chewy meat. I had to pack on the onions and sauces to give it some life. They're supposed to be known for the Adobada but I found it to lack any sort of spice. They top it off with a small slice of pineapple but I was looking more for spice than sweet.   Cabeza -- Probably my favorite which I'd probably stick to if I come back. Tender juicy cuts of beef head with a distinct smokiness that gives it just enough flavor. Of course, I still had to pack on the hot sauce and onions to give it some fire and texture.   Stop by at this foodie attraction when you're in town. If you're going with a group of people (which is probably the best strategy), come up with a game plan so you can get by with the least amount of time wasted.   Oh and don't forget to pay for your tacos like I did. After you get your food, take it to the front counter. It's all by honor system there.",

I ordered 1 vampiro & 3 Azteca tacos. The tacos were cold, messy, and had no flavor. The guacamole tastes so bland like it's made from powder. The salsa was nasty (in my opinion you need a good spicy salsa for your tacos) And my meat was cold and salty  The guy making my tacos seemed in a rush which I get it because they're busy but at least be a little friendly. He seemed too busy looking at customers rather than paying attention to the making of my food   I really don't know what the hype is about?? There are way better tacos out there!!",

The quesadillas were just OK with a different spin on them. They were open face with a small crunchy tortilla on top to give it some crunch I guess and they used a mild type of a Mexican white cheese. Be careful because the food is very messy since there's a lot of stuff they put on it. It's a super busy place and  very unorganized. It was confusing for the first time and I didn't know where to start to order. Not being fluent Spanish doesn't help and I don't think they care to help because you're in their territory so figure it out yourself. I found it was kind of cafeteria style where you order from one station and go to the next. But when I went to the next, some new arrivals were there trying to order things and I thought they were taking cuts. Maybe I was wrong because there were different starting points. Who knows but the food was OK.",

I jump out of bed, throw on whatever clothes were hanging out of my suitcase, and brush my teeth for a shorter amount of time that the American Dental Association would have preferred (9/10 of them can agree). We decide to Uber it from the Aria because, at that point, nothing was getting in the way of me and these tacos.  Except when we get in and see the chaos of the lines here. There's a different line for different meats (just like in SD), so strategy is important here. I decided to line up in the adobada line and she posted up for the asada. We ended up with a king's feast of 6 adobada tacos, 1 adobada mula, 2 asada tacos, and 1 adobada fries. Given that I'm basically twice my friend's size, it was easy to say that I had to finish most of that. We struggled with the fries in the end, but decided to secede given our valiant effort and that I wanted to make it alive to work the next day.   As for the taste of the food... the adobada here is excellent. Not the best I've had, but the salsas here make up for it. The fries here will cure any hangover you throw at it, but don't try to be a hero and order it alongside your food. We decided to walk back to our hotel to try to work off all that we ate, but I doubt we even put a dent in our caloric surplus.",

    "text": "This is the real deal taco, no tex mex, not Americanized, it is seriously Mexican tacos. Don't come here expecting Taco Bell..please don't..those tacos are nasty, but Tacos El Gordo gives real tacos. How do I know this? I frequent Tijuana Mexico and I've eaten at their location in Tijuana near the border and they taste EXACTLY the same at this location as they do in Tijuana!! They only have locations in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Tijuana. There are others that try to take the name but it isn't the same.   You start by standing in line for the meat you want. Different lines serve different meat so it's best to come with a few people so each of you can stand in a different line and order each other's food. Then you take your tacos to the cashier where you order your drink and pay.   This place has always been crowded each time I've been here. Even with short lines, I had a hard time finding seating. Be in your competitive mode when hunting down seats or take it to go.   I love their horchata and get that each time I come. It's nothing fancy but it isn't the standard one either. It's just good, cinnamon-y, and just a little thicker than water. It has a nice consistently that is perfectly sweet.   Soooo...the al pastor meat...mmmmmm...ok, I'm back from day dreaming about it. It is my ultimate favorite. I just love the light sweetness of it. There are two usual al Pastor flavors that alive tastes from top tacos spots and this one is the sweeter flavor and my fav by far. The meat is a beautiful bright red from the seasoning and juicy. I love the crusty burnt pieces that adds a crunch because it was cooked on the turny thing (lol, I don't know what it's called, I'll google it after this review).   The steak tacos are really good but I've had better in Tijuana Mexico. Maybe because I like for my meat to have flavor and this carne asada taste like straight up meat. It's good quality and not fatty (I don't like when I bit into more fat than meat).   This is a must when you visit Vegas.",

    "text": "I come to Tacos El Gordo every single time I'm in Vegas.   Every. Single. Time. I've never missed a chance and I probably never will.   Tip 1: Be prepared to wait. The lines are long, and they have a system where you stand in different lines for different meats. There's only one way in and one way out, and there's a security guard monitoring the doors (That's when you know it's serious).   Tip 2: The asada and al pastor lines are the longest, but the al pastor is also REALLY, REALLY good. It's what they're most known for and they take the meat straight off the skewer and chop it up in front of you. For some reason these lines are also the ones that move the slowest, which is why I'm giving 4 stars because the wait can be brutal especially if you're hungry and you have a tray of uneaten tacos that you got from a different line.   Tip 3: There is another line off to the side that people tend to forget about!! It's on the right side around the corner and that is where you can order meats such as cabeza, lengua, and buche. These are my favorite meats so I'm always happy this line is the shortest.   If you don't want tacos they also have other options such as sopes, tostadas, quesadillas, etc. with your choice of meat. All reasonably priced! Oh, and if you have read my other reviews about my favorite food ever (tacos) you know that I love my homemade corn tortillas! That's the only tortilla option they have here; it's oily, soft, and de-li-cious. Come here for lunch, dinner, or drunchies - you won't regret it.",

I was expecting a long line but we got right to the front immediately. It was around 5 PM last Tuesday.   Honestly I don't mess around here with any of the other meats other than the adobada. The guy was slicing off the pork right off the spit. And I always ask for the pineapple slices in my taco.   I gave the Chula Vista location five stars. If I could I would give the Las Vegas location six stars. I truly feel it is the perfect taco with the right balance of meat to sauce to toritilla. I love the green sauce and it really goes well with the marinated pork along with the onions, cilantro and pineapple.   The best! My wife and I got out of there for less than $20. Obviously the ambience is nothing but who cares, the tacos are great!",

We each ordered 3 adobado tacos with a pineapple on top and a side of chilis and onions. Everything put together made the masterpiece. At $2 a piece, it was one of the best meals I ever had. It was so good, we went back for 3 more tacos a piece. The green sauce too--reminds me of the good days when my family and I drove all the way to Tijuana just for some good tacos.   It's a quick eat--lines go by quickly and there is ample seating. Next time, I'm going to do myself a favor and get at least 10 tacos and fries with that.

It seems the longest line is for their carne asada tacos. Since we there for their el pastor and tongue tacos, the wait was short. I only ate the el pastor taco since I'm not eating beef at the moment. The el pastor was tender but lacked flavor. It looked like Chinese BBQ pork and tasted bland, no flavor at all. Being from LA, I've been spoiled by some of the best tacos anywhere and this didn't come on par with the ones I've had in LA.",

Having carne asada without the char that comes from brazing is like having elote that hasn't been roasted in its husk on a charcoal grill. It's just not authentic that way. The tripas were not fresh out of the frier, (room temp) and imho they should be served fresh out of the kettle; piping hot and still juicy. On the plus side; From the griddle they have roasted green onions and chile peppers; if ordering peppers, specify green or yellow and how many of each; from the self-serve table they have fresh radish and limes. Buen apetito!",

If you want 3 or 4 diff flavors you may spend 45 mins in line just to order.   Then you have to make another huge line to pay since there is only one cashier. The fact that you see a lot of people is not because they are good  but because the dumb ordering system and because the tacos are cheap  for las Vegas Blvd. the tacos are mediocre at best.

They have certain lines for certain meats in the tacos. We got the Al Pastor and Asada. They were both delicious. Make sure to at least get the hot sauce & guacamole crema. Soo good! It is a little smokey inside because of all the meat cooking. We will definitely be back next time in Vegas and will definitely recommend to anyone. Great spot!!",

I remember trying this after going to XS and I ate it in the morning. I thought it was manna from Heaven. But remember, I was sobering up and just woke up and all. I actually tried this place sober and went out of my way to just eat here. I ordered some carne asada tacos and they were pretty bomb. I had guacamole, cilantro, and onions on them and I ate my two tacos within a couple of minutes. I also ordered a carne asada quesadilla. That I have to admit was pretty small. It looked like two large taco tortillas put together. It did have a lot of cheese and with some salsa verde, it did the job and was finished in minutes as well. Main thing is if you're in Vegas and haven't tried this place, then try it. For me, one time is enough and I don't mind trying another taco place.",

The order: 3 asada tacos 3 al pastor tacos 1 small carne asada fries  The verdict: Good, but WAY overrated. Some of the al pastor meat was crunchy...why did they give me the burnt ends? Also, one taco had more pineapple than meat. Thanks.  The carne asada was tasty, probably better than most...salty, but not too salty, on point...so props to that.  HOWEVER...If you've been to Tijuana (which is where this place originates) you can't walk a block without bumping into a better taco...on any street corner...there are even some trucks here in Vegas that put out a taco that's easily as good.",

When u go in they point you to where they have the asada pastor and other meats so that u get in line. I think is to make the line go faster very smart. I love how they give you the tacos u get a tray n go pay. I sat outside it was really hot that day but the food just went down good they have a soda fountain and one for horchata, which is great. They only serve tacos and tacos only. I guess there must be a place for burritos somewhere but not here only tacos and thats good for me. The asada was good but i really preferred the pastor it was really good and when u go outside they have a pastor machine outside but the meat is fake it was funny. Over all great place to have tacos on a hot day with plenty of soda/horchata. My family and i will be coming back for sure.",

Doesn't get more authentic than this! The tacos were seriously the best tacos I've ever had. We got al pastor & the beef tacos, both were amazing!!!!!! They are not stingy on the meat portions at all, and they also top it off with some amazing guac & other sauces. Each taco was well worth the $2 dollars. They were so flavorful and fresh. They also give you refills on your drinks so we got some horchata which paired perfect with the tacos. Was super refreshing.  I plan on coming every time I'm in Vegas!!!!  They also have a location in Chula Vista, SD (the original one!) but this one is definitely just as good and authentic.",

Probably 9/10 street vendors were bomb, 5 stars, best tacos I've ever had to date. And I've luckily managed to find tacos almost as good in Los Angeles and in vegas (very recently).   I've given tacos el gordo on Charleston a chance about a year ago, but didn't post my review as I didn't want to get stoned to death.  I chose to give this new location a second shot for the tacos el gordo experience.   Carne asada- 2 stars. I prefer some parts of my carne asada to have a char and prefer to have the meat more marinated or seasoned. This place is not my favorite.   Al pastor- 2 stars. Pretty much for the same reasons, I did not enjoy it much.   The plain fries for $2.25 were the highlight of my night, though it's probably frozen stuff.  The salsa bar doesn't have green and red sauce, so make sure to ask for it while getting the tacos.   For those who are big fan of Tacos el Gordo, you will love this place. I had no lining up to do around 10pm on a Monday night. Wooooooo!!!!! This place will surely be poppin' as it's in a convenient location from a couple casinos (Encore and Wynn) by walking distance. Clean restaurant, with bright lights!! As for myself, I'll be sticking to other places for my taco fix.",

What I do like about the restaurant is that they make the food right in front of you. What I don't like about the restaurant is how they only have three people making the food. One recommendation I can make for the restaurant is to just take customer orders , in attempt to keep the line moving.

I also got the Asada Tacos which were really good. The line situation is kind of weird. They have different lines for specific types of tacos and you can only order those tacos if you are in the tacos designated line. So if you want a variety of tacos you will want to split up your group and order from different lines. Then you go to a separate place to pay. We got there at 11:30 and the line wasn't too bad but by the time we left around 12:00 the line was really long. I ordered 3 tacos and probably could have eaten another 3 more so don't be shy when you order.",

I wanted to try something exotic I decided on tacos de seso. Who would of thought that beef brains could be made into a meal? The tacos arrived quickly and tasted great + lots of flavor and succulence-WoWzA!! This is a go to place for Mexican food fixings! Check the signs to see which station is preparing your favorite meat-Receive tacos first then pay, ALWAYS TIP!! Con Mucho Sabor!",

The food was as good as the photos I kept seeing on my Instagram feed.   It's a different way to order your meal than I am used to, but it's pretty efficient. You line up according to which ever part of meat you want on your Taco or fries and order when it's your turn. They call your name if it's fries because it takes a few extra minutes longer to prepare the fries for the carne asada fries. I got the half portion with two tacos (one lengua and one al pastor) per person and it was still too much food for 2 people. With 3 people it was perfect. Their Horchata was good, too!   Thanks for the recommendation Mary-Ann!",

The lines were long and it was cold and windy out. But these young, energetic, \"turn down for what?\"-minded people wanted Tacos.  While the guys stood in line, me and my cousin's girlfriend waited in the car. We just kept complaining, even snapped our rants, expressing how annoyed we were haha. Literally, an hour later... by then I was probably half way asleep and still irate, the guys came out with our order.  Even though I was so disoriented, I managed to start eating my tacos. Probably after the 2nd bite, I was shook!! I come from Santa Maria, Ca where I've had what I thought could be closest to authentic Mexican food. (Why I couldn't enjoy many Mexican food in vegas). These tacos were bombbbbbbbbbb!! I was pretty mind blown. I had carne asada and carnitas. Wow!  Since then, I've declared they have the best, authentic tacos, ever!!

I'm no Mexican Food Expert but as the saying goes if you know that a Japanese Restaurant is good, you'll see Japanese people eating there. and if go to a Chinese Restaurant and you see Chinese people eating there, I can be rest assured that the food should be good as well.   Well after walking into Tacos El Gordo, which is only walking distance from The Encore where I was staying, let's just say that when I looked at all the Mexican Workers preparing the food for you, I knew I was I. For a treat. And what cemented that fact was that there were 90 percent Mexicans eating there too.   As for the food, after reading some reviews, I heard the Adobado Tacos were the one to get so I got two. I had them put everything on it and let's just say these were one of the best Tacos I have ever eaten. Make sure you ask for the Chiles that they cook behind the counter as well.   I also had a half order of the Carne Asada Fries. Warning even a half order of these fries are enough for four people. Once again, they were delicious but I could barely put a dent in it.   I also had the Carne Asada Taco, but the Adobado was way better if you ask me. If you are looking for Salsa, just ask the cashier who has it behind the cash register.   If you are looking for Chicken and Beef Tongue as well, they have it here as well.   I just love the atmosphere at these type of places. It was 1:00 in the morning and this place was hopping.    If you are ever in Vegas, this is one place you have to try if you have a hankering for delicious Mexican Fare...",

The people are friendly and I got my food quickly, but was not happy with the taste and quality of the meat -- far too salty! Thankfully, I got a horchata to wash it all down, which I love the creaminess of their mix (even if it is premade, it doesn't taste like it).   I think that because this is a chain, there should be the same level of quality across the board...with that being said, I still love you Tacos El Gordo!!!",

The locations in Vegas aren't much different, except for the fact that in Chula Vista, you have these sweet Mexican ladies making the tortillas by hand!!!  Love it!!  I am Mexican and can't make a tortilla to save my life!!  Anyway, in Vegas, the tortillas are pre-packaged ones, but freakin bomb!! Yellow corn tortillas which are the best!  We were so excited the first time I discovered there was a Tacos El Gordo in LV!  Then eventually they put one right on the strip - even better!!  Now I know whenever I am craving authentic Mexican food, I can get my \"fix\" even here on the LV strip!! These tacos hit your tastebuds firing on all pistons!! My fav are the adobada which is what they call their tacos al pastor. I am not even one who orders tacos al Pastor very often, but at Tacos El Gordo, I do!! The best.  Their beef (asada) tacos are also legit!  They have a flavor that tastes like they were grilled with a charcoal grill.  Also, they make these quesadillas called \"mulitas\" And they grill the cheese which adds even more flavor to this epic quesadilla!  A must try.",

I don't know, it's just the thought of eating tongue that doesn't sound pleasing to me at all. I'm pretty sure it tastes great, but not my cup of tea, if you know what I mean. Their carne asada fries are amazing too. They put loads of cheese and guacamole on it. Actually came here just recently this past weekend. It's a little hectic so make sure you read the signs above. Pretty self explanatory. You order from whatever you want on the menu, pay at the register, and then grab an empty seat. This place gets pretty packed on the weekends btw.",

We were surprised of how many people were waiting to get in at 1am in the rain. It's a little tricky to order at this place. Different line for different food item. The taco is small, so order A LOT! You don't wanna get back to the line and get second round, that would take forever.",

My friend introduced me about 2 years ago and now it's a must visit whenever I stop by Vegas (although they now have a shop closer in San Diego.)   My all-time favorite (and pretty much what they're known for) is the Al Pastor (pork roasted on a spit with a pineapple on top.) I'll usually get a couple al pastor tacos and some fries to split. The fries come in 2 sizes and you can get them with two meats!  Tip: don't forget to get the plate of grilled peppers/onions (delicious) and ask for some salsa on the side as well.   Cons: The wait can get long (and cold at night so be prepared.)",

Came around noonish and the line was sooo long about an hour wait under the sun. Started to wonder if waiting was actually worth it and it most definitely is.   The order line was separated into different types of meat and/or other stuff on the menu to keep the line moving.   Kept it simple and got carne asada tacos. Great tacos with handmade tortillas!   Every employee was putting up a sweat and thank you for the hard work and delicious food!   Would totally stop by every time I'm in Vegas from now on!! Hopefully next time, I could get there as soon as they open just to try other stuff on the menu as well",

If these tacos would be the normal price of other places (~$1.50) I would recommend but at their current price, that's a no from me dawg.",

    "text": "Authentic tacos, different kinds of meats to choose from, definitely food worth waiting for!  Time and time again, my friends and I always stop by Tacos El Gordo because it's an absolute staple. We get it every time it's in the area, whether it be San Diego or even a little off the Strip.  Food: My go-tos are usually 4 al pastor tacos and 2 carne asada. Though really greasy and oily, it's nice in moderation every so often because it can get tiresome time to time if you have too much. Overall, the food here is one of the best tacos you'll ever have. Everything is really fresh and made-to-order!  Service: Service is a little less average. Each meat is split into different lines and the al pastor lines are usually the fastest so if you want quick and easy service, opt for the al pastor tacos. If you want others, expect to wait longer. For example, the slender mustache-clad guy working the carne asada taco station worked extremely slow compared to his coworkers. He kept looking around instead of doing his job quickly and efficiently. Took us 30 minutes to place our taco order. The other lines are quicker though, and the people behind the cash register are even faster than the carne asada guy on June 23, 2018 around the afternoon.  Overall, I do enjoy Tacos El Gordo a lot. Every taco I've ever had was consistent and I've never had any problems with the food.",

The line is usually all the way out side the door and loops around the restaurant.  That being said the food here is very affordable and taste awesome. Each taco is usually btw $2-$3 and it is very authentic. I think this is probably the best taco place around the strip. I am not sure why don't they just open another one on the other end of the strip cause this place is definitely way over full all the time.  Today I went there around 1100 PM and the line is so long that I can't really wait. If you want to come her I recommend either come really early around 9-10 am or 4 pm, all the other time you better prepare to wait for a while.",

So this means that even if you haven't been there yourself, you may find yourself caught-up in the hype, wanting to seem like a Vegas expert, and thus recommending the place to others, just like what happens with a lot of other 'trendy' places.  It's cheap, greasy, authentic, decent Mexican food at one of the very few places where you can find cheap, greasy, authentic, Mexican food in an area on or near the Las Vegas Strip that's relatively safe for tourists.

There are two lines if your ordering a menu item for Adobada, two lines if your ordering Asada and just one line if you are ordering the Lengua, Cabeza, Sesos, or Buche. If your in a group, split up as once you get done in one line, you would have to wait in the other lines to get a different meat item but once your inside, you don't have to wait outside again in the long lines. Once you get your food, just pay at one of two cashiers.  Now on to the food. I'm a big fan of the Adobada Tacos however it's pretty small and I think I would at least need four to six to feel satisfied. Asada tacos are okay. The carne asada fries are okay with meat, guac, cheese, and salsa but I think it would have tasted a lot better with chips than fries. Overall, I would go back again if the lines were shorter and just order some Adobada tacos.",

I tried to order chicken tacos, but to my surprise, they don't have chicken. I'm not a huge fan of pork, so this left steak tacos for me. My girlfriend had the adobada tacos, grilled jalapenos and we all shared the carne asada fries. The table favorite was the fries. All 3 of us have been talking about them since. I now have a go to place when I'm in the area, those fries are going to haunt me.",

    "text": "After waiting in line for over 45 minutes, we find out that if we want to try the various meats offered on the general menu, we have to stand in 2 additional long lines (3 lines with a wait of over 30 minutes each!) Why?!  The set up at this facility is different from other Taco Restaurants. The customers get in the 1st lines (depending on what type of meat you want for your tacos) order and pick up the food, then get in a different line if you want another type of meat and so on for the 3rd group of meats. Basically Asada and chorizo cooked on a fire grill is one line, Asada and adobada, and tripas another line, and the meats cooked and kept hot with steam like lengua, cabeza, buche is at a 3rd line. Once you get your food, you line up to get a drink, then pay.  Well, with the experience of 1 line at 45 minutes, we were not about to stand in more lines so we got what we could in the line we waited for and went straight to pay and took our food to go.  The tacos we ordered were ok. We come from Los Angeles and as foodies, we know about great tacos like Cinco Puntos. The wait at this Tacos El Gordo was not, NOT NOT worth the wait.  If the management changes the logistics so the customers can order (anything from the general menu) and pay at one location, the pick up at another area, maybe the wait time can improve and I would reconsider visiting again.",

Nothing fancy, just Mexican families, bikers, normal people enjoying True Mexican tacos: delicious, greasy, spicy. And at $2 each, best value in Vegas! To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go).  Crowded at all hours so be patient! no alcoholic beverages, just sodas and \"aguas frescas\" (horchata is my favorite). My favorite tacos, it's a tough choice because all are delicious but I guess the spicy pork and tongue are the most special (the double tortilla is great, that way you don't spill the filling all over).  It's just a 10 min. walk from the Wynn/Palazzo/TI/Fashion Mall intersection.",

I've eaten at many Mexican restaurants and bottom line the only reason i didn't give them a 5 star is because the asado tacos were not that tasty. All the other meats were good and tasty.

They have about maybe 15-20 tables and maybe 2 were available when we were ready to sit and chow down. They are busy and it makes sense why since they offer good tasting fast food for a great cost.

I couldn't even taste the chorizo why even serve it ? Now as for the salsa nothing is spicy but so much flavor !!! Now if you want some heat they do provide grilled peppers as well as onions the onions didn't seem grilled more like steamed wasn't a fan of the flavor the line set up is very ridiculous to say the least it's a mess and needs to be fixed to be honest I don't see how it works all and all I rate this place a 7/10 just for the al pastor I would come back because it's that amazing and definitely check your chorizo before paying lol",

This last time we went, there was hardly any line, people do orders many tacos, so that could also be time consuming. But other than that, it's a nice place to eat at when in Las Vegas. It's always a must.",

First of all, it's ABSOLUTELY STUPID to order first and pay after. You get your food, you have to wait in ANOTHER line AGAIN to pay. They count the food on the plate and give you the total. By the time you pay, the food is already COLD.  Who in their right mind thinks ordering, then paying while your food gets cold is a good idea?!  Not to mention that there's too many lines and it's just.. ugh, completely ridiculous and this place needs some serious organization.   Food was alright. It was good, but nothing to go crazy for, really.   Not sure if I'll stop by again in the future.",

Be aware that there is no chicken served at this restaurant and limited seating during the busy times of day, which on the Las Vegas strip is most of the day and evening.   Skip the chain type Mexican restaurants over at the fashion mall food court or casino hotels and come here. I had 4 tacos for under $10 and walked out full. Its only a 5 or 10 minute walk from Wynn/Encore,Trump, Fashion Mall and the convention center area.   Wish they would open a location at McCarran Airport D Concourse!",

I've had Tacos El Gordo down in San Diego and definitely a fan so why pass up the opportunity to grab some tacos here in LV.  Line up for the type of meat you're interested in ordering from adobada, carne asada and another for less popular meat choices. Grab your food, pay at the cashier, load up on salsas and other condiments and enjoy.  They have hand-pressed, made from scratch tortillas and a variety of meats to choose from. My fave has always been Al Pastor with everything on it and the bit of pineapple with it is like the cherry on top. Do yourself a favor and slap on their green sauce, it's fire!   Prices are reasonable for solid tasting tacos and perfect as a meal sober or not. Lines are out the door, but move pretty fast. No issues hailing Lyft or Uber to and from here as well.",

Here's the breakdown:  There's a total of 4 lines: 2 for the famous adobado (which is al pastor), 1 for carne asada, and 1 for other misc meats.   Get in the correct line, order, wait for them to cook and hand you the food (which is super quick) and then head over to the cashier on the right to pay!   You can have any \"vampiro style\" aka their version of a quesadilla. Basically same as a street taco but with a different tortilla and added cheese. Good!  You can ask for onions and chilis when they cook your food at no extra cost.  The sauces are good but say no to the salsa if you can't eat spicy like me!",

    "text": "Wow, just wow...there's really no better way to describe these tacos.  Located in a strip mall just up the block from Wynn, TeG serves up the tastiest authentic Mexican tacos I've ever come across.  Friendly service, super reasonable prices and everything made fresh to order.  I sampled four varieties, all with everything on them:  1.  Suadero - tasty but a tad on the salty side.  Not bad by any means, but my least favorite of what I sampled.  2.  Chorizo - very tasty, not sure it even needed the guacamole on top but a very good option.  3.  Asada - simply amazing, the steak has a melt in your mouth consistency that I can't do justice to in words.  Would be the best of all if not for...  4.  Abodaba - holy crap these are good!  That freshly sliced pork and the green sauce on top are a marriage made in heaven.    On return i'd probably stick to the asada & abodaba as they were head and shoulders above the other stuff, nothing here was bad but they were the truly memorable ones.  If you're in town and craving what tacos should taste like get here, get on the right line (different stations have different taco types), grab a mandarina to wash it down with at the cashier and dig in, you'll have a happy belly for sure.",

We got the spicy pork and steak tacos, and my husband got a quesadilla too.   The tortillas are made as you're ordering. It's completely fresh. The meats are then cooked right in front of you.   The seating is limited so it's hard to find seats but we sat comfortably outside. Not great if you have a big party with you.

The salsa they put on top is good and not that spicy.  If you're afraid of spicy stuff you should be fine.  If you don't know Spanish or are confused just look for the red pork slices on a rotating vertical stick with a pineapple on top.  It's our version of shawarma.  Tacos El Gordo for some reason has two locations pretty much smack next to each other.  The other location which is a few buildings down looks to be newer and had a shorter line than the one we went too.",

This restaurant is a little far down the strip, across from Circus Circus, but is so worth the drive. I was a little confused upon entering the place because there are multiple lines.   There are 3 lines divided based on what you are ordering. The line can get long sometimes, but don't be discouraged because they work QUICK!  I ordered the adobada al pastor, carne asada, and suadero. My favorite by far was the adobada al pastor. It's cool because you can see them shave the meat off the spinning meat thing. The carne asada was good, but not one of my favorites. The suadero was delicious and juicy, probably my second favorite.   I wish their menu had a description of everything because I would have loved to try other things if I understood what they were. I give this place 5 stars because not only is their food good, but I have never seen employees work so quick to make tacos! They can make 3 tacos in seconds... it's crazy! I definitely plan to come back next year.",

Out of the three Al Pastor tacos we had two of them were dry. The asada was just ok. But the lengua was delicious!  We also tried our at at some carne asada fries which I'll have to say are just ok. If you're considering them, just pass.  I also recommend coming with a couple of friends if you guys want to try different meats since there are four different lines you have to stand in in order to get the meat of your choosing.",

    "text": "As close as you can get to the other side of the border for some traditional street tacos.   The vibe here is your favorite vacation Mexican taco spot for sure! Lines out the door, patio seating full and tacos tacos tacos!   They are pretty organized here. One line for your typical and approachable carne asada(grilled beef) another line for trompo and adobada ( sliced seasoned pork with or without pineapple) and one more for cabeza, lengua, tripas and other beef parts (head, tongue, intestines).   Try the trompo, that would be the line with the red seasoned pork meat upside down looking Christmas tree. Do yourself a favor and have the full traditional experience by ordering the grilled pineapple to go with your trompo tacos and ask for your salsa on the side. The red is tangy and hot, the green is milder. They also have an avocado sauce that pairs well with any of the meats.   If you order any of the other meats ask for the grilled onion and peppers on the side. These are available when you order your tacos and not at that lime and condiment bar by the drinks paying line.  Tip: cash only, so don't forget your wallet.   This place is a must when you visit Las Vegas. They have another location steps away closer to Charleston corner. I discovered it while walking back to my car. That location is not as busy and has the same quality of food.   Parking is nearly impossible here on a weekend. I had to park by a nearby pharmacy a block away but definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Hands down the BEST tacos in Las Vegas!   I was told by my uber driver to try this place for the best tacos, so my friend and I decided to go and try it out!   First I have to say, if you're going, give yourself some time as both locations (located across the street from each other) have lines at all times they are open.   The way you order can be a bit confusing since you have separate lines for different kind of tacos. When you walk inside there's lists of the kind of tacos that they have at that particular line. So be prepared to stand in two or three lines if you want different tacos.   Now the food.... it is amazing! I ordered the chorizo, al pastor and carne asada tacos with a carne asada quesadilla. So yes I stood in two lines! The meat was flavourful and the tortillas are HAND MADE in front of you! The tortillas taste fresh and delicious! Fresh guacamole, salsa, coriander (cilantro) and onions make the whole taco's taste come to ode in your mouth!   There are agua fresca, which comes from a fountain dispenser. I was pleasantly surprised it taste fresh.   Price is very reasonable and seating is limited to inside and outside table areas. Since it's so crowded, table sharing is a must.   Glad my uber driver told me about this spot. It is a bit away from the \"main\" stop part, but well worth the walk/uber/taxi ride there!   The location is towards the circus circus part of the strip and located in a strip mall that looks shady. But no worries, it was completely chill. Again, these are typically the best spots to find the best food!",

For me, ever since I moved away from San Diego, this store has been doing just that... And it never disappointed. The lengua tacos are just as good as the original!  I've brought friends here a few times and they all ended up having the best tacos they've ever had.  Tips: the carne asada line is always very long, I recommend going to the lengua line and get lengua instead. Even if you don't want lengua... The asada line is NOT the only line; there are a few other lines, usually much shorter... Just go around the asada line and you'll see them.",

Here is the run down.  - The tortilla did not taste home made.  I saw bags of store bought tortilla in the back which was disappointing. - The meat was just ok, it did not tatse like it was grill on charcoal. - No salsa bar.  - You have to wait in different lines for different meat.  Overall, at $2.40 a taco, the value wasn't there.  No home made tortilla, no salsa bar, meat lacking the grill meat flavor.  Maybe I been spoiled living in San Jose for the last 25 years. Make sure you plan accordingly, it's a popular tourist spot.  Taco El Gordo is located way down the strip pass Wynn Casino.  Not worth the drive.",

They cook the meat in front of you and you can smell it being cooked and hear the sizzle from the grill. Next they heat the tortillas on the grill next to the meat to make them nice and tasty. The chief chops everything and dumps it on top of your tortillas. It's great how they do everything in front of you so you actually know what's going on your plate and that's how their tacos are put together. Lastly on the way to pay you add the condiments you want with your taco. The lines are super crazy but these workers really work fast to help it move along. The only thing I wished was better was if they had more seating because it's so packed. It's far one of the best taco places I have ever went to.",

The prices are affordable and the food is made fresh. One of the coolest parts of the place is watching the cooks assemble the food and sear meet in front of you.  We didn't have much of an appetite but that didn't stop us from ordering an absurd amount of fries. The Carne Assad's Fries($13) was a nice treat and had good flavor. Could of used some more sauce, as the meat and fries make it alittle salty and dry.   Also was able to try a few pork tacos($2.40/e), and they were on par with the rest of the food.  Lines were super long on a mid-week afternoon, so be prepared to wait for the food(Meat) you want to try",

I went to this restaurant late after a night out on the strip and expected it to be empty when I got there wrong 1am but it was packed! After tasting the food I don't blame everyone though it's amazing! I tried the pork taco, pork quesadilla, and a beef taco. While the signs were confusing and a couple workers were kinda rude after I guess I lined up in the incorrect spot (despite the signs saying I should order the pork taco/quesadilla where I had lined up), I still highly recommend this restaurant. The meat was absolutely amazing and I would encourage you to try a variety, but if I had to recommend one it would be the pork. Expect some decent lines especially during meal times or super late when people are leaving the strip but the lines move quickly and they are definitely worth the wait!",

The lines are always ridiculous, no type of organization and barely any room to fit customers who want to dine there.  Aside from these, my main complaint is the steak itself, I was not a fan.  Kind of flavorless and chewy.  I guess I was expecting more.  There are better taco places in the area.",

They slow roast the pork on a spit with a pineapple that sits on top and drips its juice onto the meat while it's cooking. Then they shave off pieces of the pastor and put it into your taco. What more could you want! I will add that it's in a ghetto part of Vegas and there's a methadone clinic right down the road. So if your cool with being in the sketchy area, it's a great dive restaurant to hit up for delicious eats.",

Living in Norcal, carne asada fries here were a nice treat because they make it Socal style wtih fries, lots of meat, cheese, sour cream, and guac.  $10 for a huge styrofoam container full.  You can easily share this among four people in addition to your tacos.  Docking 1 star because the pork adobada gave me diarrhea.  How to order?  You wait in one of the many lines.  Tell the cook what you want and they will make it for you as you wait in front of them.  Then take your tray of food to the cashier, order a drink if you want, and pay.",

    "text": "THIS IS A GEM OF A FIND ON THE STRIP!  Once you are all buffet'd out and are looking to save money without sacrificing quality, then this is your spot! It's perfect walking distance from the Riviera and the Wynn. These guys are open late into the early hours especially on fridays and saturdays.   They have some booths inside but most of the seating is located outside in two decent sized tents which you cant miss if you're driving by on the street. On cold nights they have those gas powered heating elements for those of you that think Vegas doesnt get that cold.  The parking is decent and on some nights you have street racers meeting up here just to hang out. Im suprised this location doesnt have an armed security guard like the Charleston location.  As for the food, the three most popular items that I usually get here are the El Pastor tacos, Carne Asada tacos, and the Adobado Fries. The tacos are 2 bucks a pop and the Adobado Fries are 5 bucks for the half order and 10 bucks for a large order (the half order is virtually a meal in itself!). You have the option of having everything on your tacos and fries at no extra charge. These are the guacomole sauce, onions, and cilantro for your tacos. For the fries you can get sour cream, guacomole, and extra cheese. You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos on the side. Also you can have them put grilled pineapple bits as well, BUT YOU HAVE TO SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THESE so if you dont than they will not give it to you. That's why I love these guys, no extra charge for all those mentioned above.  I also like this place better simply because of the fact that they have TWO service stations meaning they have twice the amount of food servers and cashiers (yes they take cards and there is no minimum) which equals faster service although on really busy nights you cant tell. Plus, it seems that they speak better english here than the other location. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-go...</a>  If you are up for it, there is another place that serves an even better El Pastor. They are a couple miles away on Charleston just down the street from the other Tacos El Gordo. They are called Taqueria El Pastorcito. When you go East on Charleston, look for the trailer with the bright lights on the left side of the street just right before Los Tacos on the right side.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el-pastorcito-las-vegas#query:Tacos%20El%20Pastorcito\">yelp.com/biz/taqueria-el...</a>",

Las Vegas is a place of glitz and glamour, fine dining and awesome entertainment, yea, yea... but sometimes you need to have the simple things in life to make your day special! That my friends is Tacos El Gordo! Don't be fooled by imitators, or copy cats, Tacos El Gordo are a must have and are simply awesome!! Be prepared to wait in line and make sure you educate yourself before standing in line. They have a great system which separates the customers based on which types of tacos / food you want. At the store near the Wynn on the strip, tacos de pastor only goes to the left, all other meats are to the right. Stand in the proper line and you'll get served pretty quick. Once you order and get your food, you find a spot to sit and then go pay. It's kind of like an honor system to letting the cashier know what you have ordered, so don't try to jip them!!   The tacos de pastor are my favorite as are the Vampiros. The corn tortillas are hand made for all tacos so get ready for that!! The vampiro is sort of like a taco sandwich. The tortillas are over cooked and turned into a tostada, then the meats are piled on the bottom one, melted cheese follows, then salsa and onions and cilantro. Topped off with another crispy tortilla and there you have it.. vampiro awesomeness!!  If you like tacos, you'll LOVE Tacos El Gordo!",

The one drawback is if you want different types of tacos, such as the pork and the spicy pork, you have to get on different lines. My friend got the half order of carne fries. They were huge, it was full styrafoam container of fries, cheese, pork, guac and sauce. We couldn't finish them. The lines move pretty fast, but it is a hassle to wait on more than one line. Then you still have to wait on another line to pay. They had a tent for extra seating, which was heated. We arrived near closing and this place was packed and more people were coming in. I guess it was the place to grab some grub after a night of clubbing.",

The spicy pork (adobada) - but called pastor elsewhere, is knock your socks off fantastic. The chorizo and pork shoulder are great as well. I was adventurous and even tried the beef brain (sesos) and the beef head (cabeza). The brain is super unique,. It is extremely tender, almost mushy, and has a nice gamey aftertaste. The cabeza has more of a shredded beaf kind of texture, think pulled pork, but with some gaminess as well. I wouldn't order either again, but they were fun to try.",

Maybe it was a good thing that they started speaking to me in their native language even though I didn't understand a dam thing cause I don't want the Gringo treatment.  Make sure you get into the correct line. Go to the right for adobada, and the left for everything else. Some chica cut in front of me only to be told to move over (that's what you get, HA). All I said was \"two\", and the cook asked if I wanted everything on them. Of course! After warming the corn tortillas in some fat, He sliced some meat off of the rotating spit (the same kind they cook gyro meat on), and speedily added the onions, cilantro, and a green sauce. Spicy, greasy, crunchy, creamy...complete taco perfection. Hands down the best I've had.",

The store surroundings is brightly lit and there's a security guard that looks like he means business. My favorite taco flavor was the one with the pineapple sliver. The way it works is you walk down the line, picking up the tacos from each one of the dedicated stands. Each stand has dedicated meats. Take all your food and pay at the cash register in the corner. It's all kind of honor-code that way. For some extra crunch, try a the whole fresh radish and take alternate-bites with your tacos.",

I'm from LA where there are taco trucks around every other corner, and I gotta say that Tacos El Gordo is just as good as the best of those. I came at about 3 am so it wasn't terribly crowded, although there was still a line at all of the different stations. I only had a chance to try out an al pastor taco and an asada taco but both were delicious. I think the best part was this green salsa-sauce that they put on the asada taco....no idea what it was unfortunately. Next time I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely try to find an opportunity to come back and try some more of their food. Definitely a gem nestled at the edge of the Strip.",

She kept saying things like, \"Adrienne, are you SURE it's THIS FAR??\" I just knew it was going to be THAT good. You can't imagine how delicious the adobada was when we ate tourist food for 3 days.\"  So at the 3rd location I tried, I was confident they would be amazing. And the were, no doubt. Most of the customers in line were spanish-speaking and locals, so I took this as a good sign Consistent products state to state keep customer's from coming back right? The adobada here was juicy, flavorful and filled with pineapple and tangy salsa. My friend had a veggie quesadilla and \"veggie tacos\" which were kind of an odd assortment of toppings wrap up in tortillas...but still good and decent enough to eat.   I'm sure the chaotic nature of the ordering has been hashed out a million times over in the other reviews, but be warned- stand in line in front of what you want to eat. There are different areas of lines for each station- grill, carne, adobada spit tacos, etc. They will yell out where to stand, so listen to where they tell you to go!",

The people behind the counter forgot a couple of things we asked for. We ordered steak quesadillas and an assortment of tacos. The meat itself was good.  However, I could not taste any cheese in the quesadillas.  Also, you have to ask for salsa instead of it being included in the salsa bar most mexican fast food places have.  The salsas also were not very good.  No heat and lacked flavor.  Almost any mexican will tell you that it's the salsas that make or break a taco.

Anyone from CA is automatically hypercritical of any Mexican food, and with the high percentage of visitors from CA, you'd think that I'd be a little more satisfied with my taco.   Two stars, bc all the tacos my friends and I got were already premade and looked dry. If I was more determined, I would've requested a fresh taco, but I was hungry. My hunger was clearly not satisfied, and I ended up getting ice cream instead of taking my chances on another taco. To be clear, it's definitely not BAD, but I've experienced MUCH better, many times.",

Seriously, we waited in line outside the restaurant for about 45 minutes, when we got inside we waited in more lines depending on what kind of taco you want. We tried the Asada and the pork. The ingredients are fresh and everything is homemade. Seemed like a authentic Mexican taco shop. I would like to see them offer some chips and guac as I like to eat chips with my tacos. They really need a better system for ordering as well, so you don't have to wait in so many lines inside.  Overall, I thought that it was very good, but not worth the hour wait.",

After out drunk bingo night, we decided to fill our stomachs up on the Las Vegas strip and found this place with a huge crowd lined up from the inside out to the edge of the sidewalks onto the street! Lol a little exaggerating but this place is always busy. I can't blame them because they're Mexican authenticity of their food is delicious especially after drinking in the night life.   When you get to this place, it's so full they have to have security guard the doors to make sure is not over crowded and organizes the lines much easier that way.   Now as you walk in, there is 3 stations to order from to make the lines quicker on what options you are going for. One line was for Al Pastors, second line was for Asadas, and third line was for others. I had to go with the Al Pastor and Carne Asada Fries  I RECOMMEND THESE OPTIONS! It's so good and full of meat, cheese, fries and toppings just loaded with carbs.   The menu is pretty moderate on prices and still inexpensive for being on the Las Vegas blvd strip. For my Al pastor fries I only spent $8 and it is a huge serving good for 2-4 people.",

The line was pretty long for 11am so it seemed promising at first. We finally ended up getting our highly anticipated tacos. Maybe our expectations were a little too high because they were very underwhelming. The flavor wasn't that great and we didn't really see what the hype was about. Right after we left not only was there a feeling of disappointed but it was complimented with a nasty aftertaste and an upset stomach.  On a positive note there is a little store right next door with reasonably priced gum to get the nasty after taste out of your mouth.",

I did it for my wife who's from Mexico and loves tacos. I have to say the cooks worked fast and did a great job. Thinking about it I'd give this place at least a 4.5 stars. The tacos are good, meat, cilantro, onion and salsa, not much to it. Don't forget to pay before you eat. The setup is a little weird. Get your food, go over and pay then sit and eat. Some could get their tacos, sit and eat and leave. I don't recommend that. Please pay for your food. BTW, you can order your tacos with flour tortillas if you like them better. The food does remind you a bit of Mexico.",

There is no questioning that the tacos here are some of the most delicious outside of Mexico and CA.  However, their ordering system and the the drunk, rude, and obnoxious patrons that they allow in here sometimes prevent El Gordo from a 5 star. If you are a big fan of different types of tacos you'll have to wait in multiple lines. The most efficient solution to that is to have one friend stand in each line and order up enough tacos for your whole group. But if you're a couple visiting Vegas and want to try everything from asada, al pastor, lengua, intestines, or brain, then good luck with that on a busy weekend night.",

And that saying a lot since I was sent to the drunk tank that very same day (not my fault, drunk person grabbed me and dominoe effect, voila!).  Anyways, al pastor...spicy porn rotisserie style greatest mexican meat ever. They have the perfect blend of herbs, sauces (some type of creamy guacomole), meat, and double tortilla which they heat up first. Tacos are 2 bucks but so worth it, I always get four. Right after the taco joint across the street from Papa's and Beer's, Tacos El Gordo is my second favorite taco.   They have other interesting meats too like intestines if you are feeling adventurous. However, don't get the vegetarian quesidillas...my friend happens to be a vegetarian and they charged him full price for a meat quesidilla when there was only cheese....  Sort of hard to find, go down Las Vegas Blvd past Encore and you will see it on your right if you are heading towards Circus Circus. Great place to stop by after XS, just make sure that they are open before you walk there...as you can see I have made this mistake before.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of trying Tacos El Gordo and it was definitely worth the wait you have to endure if ordering lengua, buche or tripa.   The lengua was one of the better ones I have ever had. Soft, tender and tasteful so it  was well worth the wait. The grilled onions, radishes made a perfect combo with the lengua.  The tripa, which I had not had in a while, was perfect. It was crispy, chewy and just enough salt to being it all together.   Having to wait for service isn't terrible because it is a small place and what looks like a popular destination. Definitely a place to try if Mexican is desired.",

Who knew a $2 taco could turn you into a cunning linguist? I don't know what it is about Tijuana street food but boy are we glad they set up shop here in Las Vegas! Tacos El Gordo... Go! Go there now! Holy mother of God that's a good taco!  As we Mexican food aficionados, we were more than thrilled to finally find some good grub here in Vegas. For a mere two dollars you can get carne asada tacos, tacos de cabeza, tacos de lengua, and our personal favorite, tacos adobada (spicy pork). When you walk through the door you will immediately be greeted by the beautiful adobada roasting on a spit. Now really. Who doesn't like beautiful pork spinning about on a spit?  Warning! Don't be distracted by the $10 fries! This is a distraction for gringos! Your mission is tacos, tortas, sopes, and more tacos! All much cheaper than the gringo fries and much more delicious! So get in your car and get your ass to Tacos El Gordo!",

Considering strip inflation right in this area the pricing is really pretty good espc. considering how good the food is.   Ordering is a bit grabastic at first until you see how the system works. There's like 5 or 6 different grill stations that each specialize in certain meats, with a sign up over each indicating which are which. You go to the ones you want and order the items you want. You can combine orders at one station too if they're neighbors with the other meat you want. Then once you get the food you take it to one of the registers and they ring you up.",

Something new that I haven't seen at other places.. their Adobada is very delicious and flavorful. These are street taco size so I'm sure you will be able to chow down on more than 3 tacos. There are so many of their other stuff that I would like to try next time... like their fries? Yes please! Lengua Fries to be exact!

When you get the pork don't forget to ask for pineapples, other wise you won't get it. I did not realize I had no pineapple until it was too late, by then I was over it. Their carne asada is NOT good! They skimp on their dry carne asada and when they serve it to you, they place it upside down so you're left with even less meat.

Juicy and tender, I love how they cook it right then and there so you know its fresh! You can also ask for grilled veggies! Don't forget to ask for their hot sauces when you're ordering because they don't have a hot sauce bar.  Their sopas are also superrr good. Would really recommend it!

This is a must-go if you are in vegas - cheap, delicious, tasty tasty food! Convenient parking, available seating.  What more can you ask for?  Last time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)

Then the guy just kind of throws it together. They're worth probably maybe a dollar at the most. I've seen some pictures on Yelp when it looks like they're really getting their money's worth I don't know if it's because they're so busy that the guy just kind of slapped it together best he can and in the time period. I can tell you that the girl sitting next to me she had I guess pretty eyes and looked better than I did being a man of course. Her taco was probably twice the meat and literally looked more appealing. Unfortunately I got three tacos and it was really very little meat you figure for almost $7 come on folks, give me something to bite into! Then I got the carne asada half order of fries. I split with my girlfriend and it was really gristly the carne asada was tasty but so much gristle. Just a lot of frozen tasteless fries. Tiny very little splash of guacamole little splash of sour cream not enough cheese not melted enough.  I thought $7.50 for a half order of fries I'm not joking you folks $13 for an order of meat on fries my suggestion is pass on the asada even though some of the pictures is online look very appealing. Just get the pork that's what they're famous for if you're not into tongue and brains and eyeballs then that's what I would suggest. Unfortunately the line was probably 30-45 minutes standing outside,  yemps in low 50s. Only then you get inside you have to order in each line . The meats that you need there is a security guard in the beginning that will kind of host you right to where what line you need to be in which I thought was a really nice Personal Touch. Then you order your meats and you can order fries from any line and then I would suggest a sit-down start eating your food cuz it'll get cold fast and tables inside are few and far between.  Then wait for them to call out your name and your fries will be ready. I would suggest just unless you have more than two people to just stick with the half order it's really not worth $13 to save a little bit of money to get a bigger order of in my opinion nothing that great. Then it might give you an opportunity to have more of the al pastor that's what I would suggest.",

Doing so I make sure i stay at the Encore instead of Wynn so it's that much more convenient to get to a couple of times a day. I mean, here in LA there are tons of good taco places but.. This is something else! Tacos are plain  the only thing is it can get super packed at times so takes a few minutes in the line to get to order but well worth the wait each and every time!  I just lowered my 5 rating because of my recent visit here a month ago. They really ruined the taste and the quality of the food here unfortunately. I don't know what they do different now but from what it was to what it is now there's a day and night difference and not in a good way. I'd probably never go back even after recommending hundreds of people to go visit prior to my last trip to vegas",

    "text": "Finally got to try the famous Tacos El Gordo! Albeit in LV, I was quite excited to try this popular taco spot. We came on a Wednesday around 2:00ish. There's a parking lot. Not big, but we were able to get a spot.  There was a line, but not bad as this place usually gets. You need to get in line according to the meat you're ordering. I got in the Abodaba/El Pastor line. I ordered 7 adobada tacos for three ppl, but the guy accidentally gave me 8. No problem! I asked for everything with pineapples. If you want pineapples, you need to ask for it. He chucks a thin piece off the whole pineapple that's roasting on top of the spit.   I was watching the man make the tacos. It was a thing of beauty. He first grabs about 20 tortillas and lathers the sides of it in the drippings of the pork fat. (Heart-eyed smiley face emoticon inserted here.) After heating up the tortillas, he masterfully slices off slices of the unctuous marinated pork, tops it with onion, cilantro, salsa, and their famous green sauce. Using his long knife, he clips the pineapple and tosses it onto the taco for a perfect finale.  My sister was in the beef line and got an order of carne asada fries. You take all your food to the cashier where you pay. We also got an horchata. There's also fresh radishes and limes to help yourself to.  Upon my first bite, I knew why this place was so popular. I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was everything I wanted in a taco and much more. The pork was flavorful and perfectly cooked. I loved the green creamy sauce. The pineapple offset the spiciness from the onions and sauce. Squeeze some lime on it. Take turn eating the radishes in between bites of the taco. Taco heaven. It was so good that I ordered an extra one to the two I ate.   Also, FYI, you need to ask for grilled peppers and green onions as well. I forgot with my first order, but remembered to get it for my second.  The fries were okay. I found the asada a bit dry. I think the adobada fries would taste better. The horchata was very delicious too. Creamy and cinnamony.  Plenty of seating. People eat quite fast and clear the tables quickly.  Oh, boy. As I'm writing this review, I wish I could be eating a taco right now. Definitely try this place!! I'll probably look for an excuse to go to SD now, just to eat this masterpiece.",

They were so busy that there wasn't any inside seating and the lines were stupid long too.  We had to eat outside, but that was complicated with not high tables or chairs out there.    The tortillas are made fresh and the guys behind the counter are fast.  Some dishes take a lot of time, so I hope the person in front of you doesn't order something like mulas because it requires the melting of cheese.  That could easily take up to a minute to make.  Other than that, I recommend any of the tacos.  I've tried a bunch of their meat, but I like the al pastor the best.  I've had the quesadilla and mulas and I'll always come back just for the tacos.    For about $2.50 a taco with tax, this will be one of the best deals on the Strip.",

The salsa had a little bite but not too hot.  The bright green cream sauce pulls it all together.  I also was able to try one taco made of tripas and I like that they deep fry it so it's extra crunchy.  I tried the cabesa also and it was ok.  It was also pretty good.  My only complaint was that they have different lines for each order.  If you want asada you stand in one line, el pastor another line, trip as another line.  It sucks if your alone.

    "text": "I was looking for a cheap lunch in Las Vegas after Sunday mass so I found this place nearby.  When I first entered the place with my brother, I was confused when looking at the multiple lines in a busy crowd.  There were signs that labeled specifically for different meats.  For instance, one line was for lengua and tripe, another line was for asada, and another for al pastor and so forth. So if you want to get different types of meats without wasting time, it is best to bring in a group of people and have them order from different lines while you order from another line. Teamwork is crucial here.  By the way, there is a cashier line near the exit, which is separated from the rest of the multiple lines.   I ordered 2 lengua tacos and 1 tripe taco from the same line.  I also ordered the horchata drink when I went to the cashier line but was disappointed that the horchata was watery and bland.  The tacos, however, were amazing and delicious.  I loved the texture and moisture of the lengua tacos and was intrigued to order the tripe (intestine) from someone who told me about it while I was waiting in line. I liked the texture of the tripe taco but wasn't a fan of the grimy taste.    The tacos were affordable and service was okay at best. I ended up getting these to-go so I can meet up with my group of relatives in another place.   Overall, I am glad that authentic tacos such as these from Tacos El Gordo exist in Las Vegas.",

We've visited Las Vegas on numerous occasions but have never been to Tacos El Gordo which is supposed to have the best tacos. Right when we got there, there was a line so prepare to wait they have multiple lines, and certain lines serve 2 types of meat. Don't know how this would work if you come alone and want multiple types of meat, set up was not efficient. But luckily for us we had 3 people in our group, so we all were able to separate into whatever line to get each other's tacos. We got the al pastor, asada, and cabeza. The cabeza wasn't too crazy for it was a bit too salty for me, asada was pretty good, and the al pastor was probably the best one. But if you watch them make the al pastor you might have a heart attack like I almost did. They dip the tortilla in grease and once the taco is put together they throw even more of the grease drippings to top it off, I could feel my arteries clogging up! But if you're not too health cautious as I am you'll enjoy it!",

    "text": "We came around noon and there was a line outside the door which was expected because this place is very popular. We probably spent about 30 minutes in the like outside. Once we got in the door, they informed us there were different lines for different meats, so if you party wanted to try different kinds of tacos, you'd have to split up. My bf and I split up and we spent about 30 more minutes in line. Once you get your food, you take it to the cashier and pay. So overall it took us 60 minutes to get our food.   We ordered carne asada and al pastor tacos. I thoroughly enjoyed them both but I think I prefer the carne asada over the al pastor tacos. We ordered 8 tacos total and our total was about $20. I'd say it's pretty averagely priced and totally worth the money!   The tacos here are amazing but I don't know how often I would come back. It was a hassle to order.",

So, you want beef, you stand in the beef line and when you arrive at the counter you get your beef tacos, for instance. But if you want a pork taco, you have to take your beef taco to a new line and wait to get to the counter to order your pork tacos.   It's a very inefficient and strange way of ordering, but honestly, the food is worth it. Go. Eat. You'll love it despite the strange ordering system.",

It's located slightly further down the strip in a slightly sketch(ier) neighborhood. We parked at Wynn and walked over. for $2 per taco, not bad! I highly recommend you get the adobado. Don't get anything else, the line takes longer. I'm mesmerized at how they slice the meat off the rack. And don't forget the pineapple!!! So delicious. I also ordered a horchata to top off my meal and was surprised it came out of the soda fountain.   Will definitely visit again on my next Vegas trip!",

I was not disappointed by the food, my fave were the asada and cabeza tacos, the pastor were alright and the tripas were too overcooked. The only thing i did not like was the system they are using to get the tacos. I wanted to try one of each so had to wait forever to eat my tacos by the time i was outta line and paid and found seatimg my tacos were cold :(  Would still go again. Maybe with another system of ordering my tacos.",

While I also love this place, I need to give an honest review and not let the delicious food get in the way of me looking at the overall picture.  During a spur-of-the-moment 3 day trip to Las Vegas, we went to Tacos El Gordo a total of 5 times, sometimes more than once a day -- Yes, that's how much we love this place. This place is so authentic that they don't even give you the option of ordering a burrito! (So if that's what you're craving, you're not going to find one here.) The meats on the tacos were cooked well and the combination of everything they put on it was perfect. They are generous with the guacamole and everything else, but... half the time when I get my tacos they are cold. This is because sometimes they will cook the meat in advance and store it in a nearby metal can and continue to cook more meat. This is effective when there is a lot of customers but cold tacos aren't as good as fresh, warm tacos!   With that said, leftover tacos still tastes amazing so no worries, but warm tacos are still better.  PROS: - Generous guacamole & everything else on the taco - Delicious - Great hours - Fair prices - Fast taco making  CONS:  - Half the time I saw my asada come from a metal can and not the grill",

    "text": "While I think the food at Tacos El Gordo's was okay, the dining experience as a whole was rather forgetful.  First, what is the reason for having multiple lines for different kinds of meat? It makes zero sense to me. The lines are slow and you can forget about getting multiple meats if you come alone. Luckily, I was able to try several meats because we got in different lines. We waited over an hour at the two popular lines but there were other lines that had much less people. Why don't they make things more efficient and let people order any meat at any of the stations?  The adobada, which is the meat they're known here wasn't all that interesting to me. I don't understand why everyone is crazy about this red pork. Don't forget to ask for the slices of pineapple off the top of their spit. You can also ask for the grilled veggies and peppers with your tacos. Out of adobada, asada, cabeza, and lengua, I liked their lengua the most. It was probably one of the best lengua tacos I've had, actually. Unfortunately, I didn't think much of their sauces.  Even though the tacos weren't bad or anything, the whole waiting in line forever and having different lines for different types of meat marred the overall experience here. It was very difficult finding a table to eat at as well. Hopefully some of these issues were particular to this location. I'm hopeful that I'll have a better experience at one of their other locations.",

Stopped by the one in the strip north of the Wynn to get a quick bite before heading out to the airport to catch a plane back home. Perfect meal to satisfy your stomach prior to a 5+ hour plane ride. Their food is not greasy at all like most places. They make everything right in front of you - all made to order items which makes it very fresh. My wife and I had the tacos - tripas (beef tripe), asadas (steak), el pastor (pork cut right in front of you) and the lengua (beef tongue). All were great. I also ordered a beef quesadilla which was a nice dish as well.  They can get quite busy at times and the line builds up pretty quickly however they do move the lines fairly fast. They have a good system going. Clean eating area making it very comfortable to dine in. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Compared to the branch in San Diego, this location was pretty disappointing (and I LOVE the the one in San Diego).   However, when you run out of your famous spicy pork/al pastor before midnight, with 2 more hours of operation, it's hard not to be disappointed. It's even more disappointing when you dole out your last portion of spicy pork to one dude, who realized that he should order 20 tacos instead of the 4 he was originally going to get, because he can (though I guess I can't exactly fault the establishment for that).  So we decided to deal with it. While the tripa tacos I got were just as good (super delicious for those curious), they got my friend's order wrong (they gave him the asada instead of the tripa)... twice...  Maybe we just came on a bad night, but I think I'll stick to the one in SoCal for the foreseeable future.",

I think we came on a Friday at bout 7 and this place was slammed with a lot of authentic looking people so I'm guessing it was legit. There are various ordering lines that my group was clueless too even though they had signs. They had both English and Spanish but still confusing. We definitely ordered in the wrong line and the employee was annoyed with us.   On to the food, we got a couple carne tacos and I think accidentally got shoulder or tongue. The texture was weird on that one, but the flavors were great. Tacos are about $2.5 each or so and guys you'll prolly need 3 at least.  Ok on to my favorite part of the meal, the carne asada fries (forget what they are called on the menu, but doesn't say fries I don't think). Also, on the menu board I think it says $13, but I don't think it's clear because we were giving a 1/2 order but it was $8 I think. The 1/2 order can be shared by two people, it's a lot of food. Tons of cheese, guacamole, and sour cream or something gooey. Plenty of meat on it as well.  The big negative here is that there is no seating and the strip mall seems a little suspect. But if you want tacos and carne asada fries give it a shot.",

The line was out the door, there was about 15 people in front of me and It took about 45 mins  to make it in the door. Once inside there were about 6 lines more so Im standing there puzzled and I ask the lady in front of me how does this place work.   So, I need to stand in line for the type of meat tacos I want. Well I wanted 2 of each so that means I have to stand in each line to get my tacos and each line has about 15 people waiting. So, I decide to stand in the shortest line and get whatever they have. That took about 1 hr 15 mins.   Once I had my tacos I had to stand in another line to pay.   Total time to get soggy, cold and expensive tacos 2hrs. Never again. For $50 next time I'll eat at a casino buffet.   If you decided to eat here make sure you dont come alone. Bring atleast 6 people with you so then each person can wait in each line at the same time and one can wait by the tables in hopes of getting a seat.",

This restaurant is also located in San Diego and they both deliver great cheap Mexican food. Keep in mind when you order food, you first get the food up on the counter then take it to the back to process your payment. I feel like customers could just skip the payment lol, but I guess they believe the honor code here in Vegas.  Now the foood! I got the cabeza and al pastor taco which were both great and flavorful. The cabeza was awesome and just melted in your mouth. I also got the lengua fries, which was only tasty on the top. The reason is because there's no Flavoring on the bottom. The sauce and meat only exist on the top of the fries.   Overall, this place was solid but not the greatest. But if I'm around I'll definitely come back",

    "text": "Great street tacos! You have to go in separate lines depending on which meat you want. The most popular al pastor and asada are of course in different lines so if you're looking to get both, I'd recommend having a friend with you. If you're going alone, go in the asada line first because it seems longer. That way your wait for al pastor is shorter and your food won't get cold.  I had both the asada and al pastor tacos and they were both really good. I think I prefer the al pastor a little more but you can't go wrong. I went there a little before 6PM and the line was about 6-7 parties outside the door. By the time I finished ordering and sat down, the line at least doubled in size.   They are open until like 5AM, but the late night rush is super busy so you'll be waiting for a while.",

    "text": "Best.Tacos. Hands down. '  Unless you're in Mexico, you're not going to experience a better taco than here at Tacos El Gordo. We love the Al Pastor - it's perfection on a spit. The entire experience here feels genuine.   It's typically pretty easy to park, and unless you're in the touristy season, you can usually get in pretty quickly, although there are times when the line is out the door - which is insane.   We always head straight to the al pastor line and get three (at least) tacos each. They're served on small paper plates, double-corn tortillas, carved from the spit right in front of you. I love to watch the expertise, you can tell these guys have been doing this for a while, and man am I glad! The spice is on point, the sauce is heaven, and the size is perfection.   Inexpensive, perfect tacos is what you can expect here, along with Mexian sodas, horchata, and swift service. Yes, there are a ton of people here, but that's because it's incredible. Order more than you think you'll eat - because they disappear quickly from your plate. :)",

    "text": "Talk about a confusing layout. Uh oh!  For first-timers, know what you want ahead of time so that you don't crowd around the area. Once you walk in, you'll see that lines are sorted depending on the meat type you want, and things work quickly here so study your Spanish ahead of time kids! Once you walk up to a line that has your meat of choice, this is your chance to tell your chef what toppings you want (onions, cilantro, etc.) that's near them. Don't be shy now!   Also, they have these grilled green onions and peppers that you can ask for on the side just as an added taco comfort food (it's delicious btw!). The great thing about this place is that they cook your taco meat and put everything together in front of you so you know exactly what goes inside. Once you're done gathering your made-to-order tacos, you stop by the register at the right corner of the store. Pleaseeeee, remember to bring cash because there are times where the system goes down. Better safe than sorry!   Overall, my experience was up and down. I didn't know how to order, where to order, and how to react when the cashiers all of a sudden told me that the card reader stopped working. BUT! I'm hoping that with this review, you can be a whole of a lot better prepared than I was at that moment. Enjoy!",

After standing outside and then standing in line again once inside, we decided that the al pastor and carne asada would be it. I wasn't going to stand in yet another line for the tripe.

If you go at peak times, waits can be long and seating sparse. As locals, I'd recommend this for a weeknight lunch or dinner to deal with less crowds.",

    "text": "I have yet to see a taco joint where they serve excellent tacos AND fries. Here, you are delighted to tacos of all kinds of meat from asada to lengua. So you won't be limited to only one particular kind of meat.  The tacos are seriously STUFFED with meat, onions, cilantro, and sometimes mild sauce or guacamole depending on what kind of taco you order. Just a tip for preferential purposes, you can even order corn tortillas which are somewhat bigger than the standard size tacos. Remember, you have to ask for all the sauces when you pay for your food.  On the other hand, they serve fries! Be mightily warned that the full size rack of fries is HUGE. So unless you have a somewhat normal appetite and stomach, feel free to order the full size, otherwise, I highly recommend the half rack so you can get some tacos. They have carne asada fries, but my favorite is the campechana fries. The campechana fries consist of asada and adobada(similar/identical to pastor). And included is your standard set of sour cream, onion, cilantros, guacamole, and etc.   This is conveniently located northbound on Las Vegas Blvd ahead of Wynn/ Encore. Which makes it the perfect place to fulfill your drunchies after a night at Surrender or XS.   So many good things to say about Tacos El Gordo but why the one subtracted star? Prices. Coming from LA, I don't think I ever paid $2 tacos. But unfortunately, I have no other choice but to pay the full admission for a single taco in order to fulfill my meticulous craving for Mexican food.",

I had three Adobada Tacos (spicy pork) and my wife had a Steak Taco and a Beef Tongue Taco.  The tacos also came with a plate of sauteed scallions and hot peppers.

    "text": "We had Tacos El Gordo last night for dinner.  The environment is hectic. The place was packed with people and there was a lot of confusion over the fact that you had to stand in different lines for different items. They are set up station style. This can be a little problematic if there is only one of you ordering but you want different things which is why the only thing I ordered was 8  Tacos De Adobada because I ended up in that line. Next time I will make sure there is at least 3 people with me so one person can stand in each line to order a variety.  The tacos were on your typical small duel corn tortillas flash fried in oil. The meat was sliced right onto the shells and then the tacos were dressed with fresh cilantro, red salsa, chopped onions and then a creamy avocado sauce.  Two thumbs up for the tacos. They were delicious and after we ate them I wish I had ordered about 4 more. There is just something about tacos in the west that are truly fantastic and you just cant beat the prices.",

    "text": "What a great place to get some food when you are hungover and need some greasy tacos to ease that headache. Some things are great about this place and others that I could pass on.  The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.  The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too.   Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.  The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered.   The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.  So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.  Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating.",

    "text": "They have a confusing system of ordering first at one of the two cooking stations then paying at one of the two cashier stations you hope have an employee at them so you know where to pay. I was so confused for the first 10 minutes I was there. That, and my arm got burned by a fleck of something that came off the grill across the way while I was just waiting for my food. I asked for a cup for water and was given one, but they didn't have a dispenser for water at either of their two drink fountains! I tried pulling the little tab under the Sprite that is normally water, but all I got was super flat and disgusting tasting Sprite. I  was super irritated!  Apart from that, the spicy pork tacos are epically amazing and deserve 5 stars alone. I wasn't a fan of any of the other tacos.  I soooo had wished my experience would've been better so I could justify going back here for more tacos. Make sure to ask for everything on them, cause the extra additions and sauces make the tacos taste so much better.",

    "text": "One of the best taco experiences I have had in Las Vegas. I had four tacos in total (was very hungry): cabeza, lengua, asada, and adobado. None were disappointing, but the cabeza stood out as possibly the best incarnation that I have had.  I dug the way they have the restaurant set up, since you can see the meat being cooked where you're ordering from. It adds a little extra time if you are ordering from multiple stalls but is well worth it.  The prices are ok, I wouldn't say the selling point is the price though--it is the quality of what you get. The tacos are perhaps slightly on the small end but not egregiously so.",

Each meat has a different line you wait in to order, and you pay at the end at a cashier cafeteria style. $2.40 for each taco. We came on a Friday evening and there was no wait.

    "text": "Do NOT(!) be intimidated by the lines you see inside, even if you're surprised at their length when you go at an off peak time(i.e. early to mid evening). They move quicker than you may think, and before you know it, your food will be ready and served to you. Honestly I went by here a bunch of times before finally realizing I should pull a trigger and do a visit(and ultimately on my last trip I went here twice, and wish I'd done more visits), and I'm honestly not sure when you don't see lengthy lines inside.  Anyway, the process is simple for ordering. You order in whatever line that has the meat you're interesting in getting for your tacos, and I got the impression you could order things from different designated lines as well if you want to. I know at least on one of my visits, I ordered an item that wasn't on the menu board for the specific line I chose to order from. After that, you turn around the other direction(behind where you were facing in the line towards the kitchen area) to the register, and pay.  Food was really great here, and I never was disappointed with ANYTHING I ordered. The adobada(spiced pork) was my favorite of the tacos I tried, but I also liked their al pastor taco as well. And also, the horchata and whipped drink machine was nice to see inside, and I liked trying all those various drinks out while I was here. I wish at least one Chicago taqueria, had a drink machine like this! If there at least one Chicago taqueria out there that has such a drink machine that I'm not aware of, please respond to this review and leave me a comment. Not talking about any places with special mom and pop sodas in the machine btw, like the one at Tacos In A Bag in Chicago.  But yes as I said when starting this review, this place is a MUST TRY if you're in Vegas. Don't be put off if you see a long line even at a time when you don't think the line will be as long(i.e. late afternoon/early evening, or if you go at midafternoon on some day), just brave it out and enjoy your food. I always thought the staff here really does try, to move along the line and serve everyone at a good speed.",

I highly recommend the Adobada, which is basically spicy pork!! It's honestly the only meat that I get lol. The fries were also pretty good too! We were able to share with a few others. I'm not sure what the green sauce they use is but it really adds to the flavor. Plus the food comes out fast, yay!!   Overall, I always make a stop here whenever I'm in Vegas hehe. (: This is place is worth the hype, forsure. It's a great place to eat after the day club or if you want to grab a late night meal! We ate here several times when we stayed. Note it can get pretty crowded at night and on the weekend though.",

    "text": "Ok.. about a 40 minute wait on a Sunday morning at 1am.  They had a man singing in the patio area in Spanish to entertain the crowd I'm sure.   By the time we paid and found somewhere to sit it was about 2am so an hour total between waiting and finally getting to devour our food.   Once you get inside there are 2 separate lines.  1 for carne asada, the other for al pastor. If you Came with someone else you'll have to wait in different lines.  You can order fries in any line.  My recommendation would be the adobada al pastor tacos. These were well worth the wait and don't forget some extra avocado dip.   One you get your food, you have to walk to the cashier located by the fountain drinks are the rear of the place by the exit doors to the patio. Kind of an odd setup cause it's backwards but I guess it works.   Freshly made tortillas and freshly grilled carne asada.  You can watch the lady rolling the masa into a ball with her hands and pressing it with the tortilla press then grilling it on the grill.   Ordered 10 carne asada tacos, 6 al pastor adobada tacos , small carne asada fries & a drink. Total was 55.26. Took some home for the family.  Indoor and outdoor seating.",

    "text": "LO MEJOR DE LA MEJOR ADOBADA! AWESOME SPICY PORK!! ONE OF THE BEST CHEAP EATS ALONG THE STRIP!  Originally San Diego based, this Las Vegas location (now there are two) has flourished from the very moment they opened nearly a decade ago.   Their signature meat is the adobada - spicy pork marinated with a mixture composed of vinegar, a variety of peppers, and herbs and other spices. It is then cooked by a gas flame while folded over a vertical rotisserie.  Often also known by the name al pastor. These are some of the tastiest marinated pork tacos I have ever tried, which includes some of the most iconic spots to get them throughout southern California where I am from.  The meat is incredibly flavorful, tender and juicy. Succulent is a word not often associated with meat prepared in this fashion because it is sliced thinly and quickly dries. Their made-from-scratch, creamy guacamole also adds another dimension to the flavor and texture. The sweetness of the pineapple, which rests on the top of the meat as it cooks, softens the meat and further adds to its flavor essence.   Choice of meat fillings include the following: Adobada (Spiced Pork), Carne Asada (Grilled Beef), Azteca (Grilled Beef and Catcus), Tripa (Beef Guts), Buche (Pork Stomach Lining), Suadera (Beef Breast), Cabeza (Beef Head), Chorizo (Mexican Sausage), Lengua (Beef Tongue).  The other choices are good to great as well. All tacos are wrapped with their house-made corn tortillas. Tripas and chorizo were also fantastic but the adobada is in a league of its own.   Tacos de adobada or tacos al pastor - whatever you want to call them - this place is a must stop if you are a fan. They are as good as it gets.  Conveniently located in the middle of the Vegas Strip, next to the Wynn and Encore hotels, and open late (until 2am).",

We visited at 3am after a night out and I was under the impression that these tacos would blow my mind based on all the great reviews.   Wrong! The meat and asada fries are tasteless! Not only is the food overpriced but it doesn't taste fresh or originally homemade as they claim. Everything was bland :/  The wait is ridiculous. There is a line for each type of meat. Seriously?! Who has time for that?! Management needs to come up with a better system.   Regardless, this place is nothing but hype! I was not impressed at all.   If you want real street tacos that have an addicting taste, then you need to try Tacos El Venado in North Hollywood.   Tacos El Gordo, I will not be returning. Thanks a lot of nothing.

If you're one person, you would have to wait on separate lines in order to order the type of taco you want. Pork one line, steak another, etc. Your food will most likely be cold.  If you're two or more, conquer and divide. Much more effective! Haha  BTW: I personally, would never wait on a line!  And if you're expecting customer service, keep walking.

Tacos El Gordo shines brightly with several offering like Beef tongue, Beef Head, Pork Adobada, and Cautus.  The Beef Tongue was my favorite of the ones I tried.  Incredibly tender, the tender meat offers no resistance upon chewing.  Skip the fries, they are wannabe McDonald's, leaving you wanting to be at McDonald's.  They can and should do better here round out a meal.  As for the ordering process, there are separate lines for tacos.  You grab a tray and head to the one you want to get.  You may wait on several lines before you are able to sit down and savor your hunt which is not clear if arriving the first time.    Don't make the same mistake I made and bring a non pork/beef eating friend here.  They won't find much if anything to eat other than some bad fries.",

Tacos el gordo is always my must stop when in Vegas!   *Ambience: nothing fancy and they have 3 locations the furthest from the street is the one the locals go and itsless crowd med but this time i came to his location not in a rush hour so it was good.  *Service: i dont know how they came up with this idea but the lines SUCK!  There are different lines for different tacos so you definitely want to come here with friends so each of you can stand in one line for chorizo, another one for tripe, another one for al pastor and so on. And after that you have to stand in another line to pay!!! Sucks but the tacos are so good that i am ok on wasting so much time waiting in line!   FYI everything is beef based so they dont have any carnitas. My favorites are: Intestines (my favorite!!), cabeza and lengua!!   Everything is homemade and definitely #bellyapproved and #pocketapproved",

The lines can be long but you are worth the wait.  Your carne asada tacos are delicious but it's the al pastor tacos that steal the show.  The al pastor tacos with a bit of that grilled pineapple really takes the whole taco eating experience to a whole other level.   All the employees there are courteous and friendly and there is always someone going around to make sure the tables are clean.  I came to visit twice during my 4 day Las Vegas visit and I would seriously eat your tacos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Thank you for such a great eating experience.  Until next time!

Except you accidentally got in line for Dumbo and waited ten years for a disappointment. And guess what? You a dumbo for waiting in line for those tacos lol   We got food poisoning a few years back. Okay maybe it was a fluke? I tried again last year and gross. There is something about the taste of their food, it doesn't taste sanitary. I'm not sure what it is but I had diarrhea the second time. So that's it for me.   Gave it two tries... Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, I'm looking like Dumbo. And I'm tapping OUT.   Writing you off Gordo. Never again.",

I don't know how Mexican they are.\" is the response he gets.  Well, at Tacos El Gordo in La Vegas, the tacos are in fact both authentic, and Mexican.  I had the less adventurous carne asada tacos, which were probably on the order of three stars compared to others I have had, but she went ahead and tried the real thing - the beef tripe, beef head and beef tongue tacos, which she said were very good.  The tacos come pre-made, with onions, cilantro, spicy salsa and guacamole, nothing more to add, on hand made corn tortillas.  At the food order spots you may ask for free grilled peppers and green onions. Self service for limes and sliced radishes.  Tacos are $2.60 each, and on the small side, but not tiny.  Take Out (they wrap the paper plate in foil) and dine in.  Within walking distance to the Encore (take out for the suite).  This is their newly opened location that was closed for a bit for remodelling, has outdoor seating.",

And my bf said their al pastor meat reminded him of Chinese char siu LOL, which was kinda True. Normally the al pastor meats are more saucy and juicy, and this one was on the dry side.   I've heard from friends that the SD location is way better the LV. I think I'll stick to the local places in the Bay Area.",

Best part (besides their food being made right in front of you) is that they're open late! The food at this location is so good, you may even come across a 45 minute wait time for it. Not always, though. They also offer other items, not just tacos. For example, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, and even asada fries! And it's reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. You do have to wait in multiple lines if you're getting different meats, but their ordering system works. So give yourself a few minutes to figure out what you're going to get and then hop in line. The last time we went I did notice they added more seating outside, so that's good, they're lines can get pretty long. Especially on the weekends.",

    "text": "For everyone who doesn't have the luxury of living near the San Diego/Mexico border, you can now get your Tacos El Gordo fix in beautiful Las Vegas.  For the uninitiated, it is absolutely worth visiting if you are a fan of authentic Mexican food.  Just beware of the ridiculous lines during lunch and the silly ordering system that works in theory but fails miserably in execution.  When you get there, you'll see that there are multiple lines for each of the meat stations.  Each station is supposed to be dedicated only to a particular type of meat or meats, but the lines aren't labeled and it's more of a free-for-all to get to the front than anything else.  To further cause problems, people will wait in one line (carnitas for example), but when they get to the front they order something that's supposed to be from another station (asada for example).  This causes delays because the guy at the carnitas station will have to ask the guy at the asada station to make something for the guy who stood in the wrong line in the first place, which causes both lines to get further backed up.  Confused yet?  Yeah, it's a big mess.  But let me save you the trouble of having to wait in multiples lines.  I've tried pretty much all the meats, and I can confidently say the only meat that really makes this place unique/special is the adobada (spicy pork aka al pastor).  It's frickin' delicious!  The meat has a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness, and is packed with salty sweet flavor.  Whether you get it in a taco, tostada, quesadilla or whatever, I guarantee it will be good.  The other meat choices don't even hold a candle, but you can wait for them if you want.  You've been warned!",

    "text": "Ignore the low reviews; they don't know what they're talking about. Anyone who could compare this to Taco Bell is either loco or was born without taste buds. This is literally better than anything I ate at Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, and for a fraction of the cost (and, tbh, ambiance).  Now I'm not that knowledgeable about Mexican food, and it's not one of my top 5 favorite cuisines. That said, this is the one of the few places I ever actively want to go for Mexican. In fact, I hardly eat tacos anywhere else anymore, just to save up my taco stomach for whenever we come to Vegas. (My other favorites we go to far less frequently, as they're in Santa Barbara and New Paltz, NY.) I also appreciate that this is one of the few more authentic places that offer flour tortillas to gringas like me.  My favorite tacos here are the lengua (tongue), cabeza (face/cheek), buche (pork), and al pastor with raw onions and no cilantro. I can't rank them in finer detail than that -- my favorite is whichever one is currently in my mouth (phrasing)! They each come with a different sauce they put on for you, and all of them are distinct and delicious.  I also like the queso asada with salsa and guacamole, though the asada is a bit too salty for my tastes (the salsa and guac balances out the salt a bit). I usually don't get this.  The vampiro is not for me because it's made with corn tortillas, but lucky for me the queso asada has all the same fillings. Normally I like brain (give me a Midwestern brain sandwich or Indian lamb brain curry any day) but the sesos taste kinda off to me here.  Fries (campechana fries $13; lengua fries - full order $15, half order $7.50) aren't anything special, but are huge and great for sharing.  I haven't tried the quesadillas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), sopes ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua), tostadas ($2.25 with any meat except lengua or $2.40 with lengua), or mulas ($4.50 with any meat except lengua or $4.75 with lengua).  My husband likes that you can get pretty much whole raw radishes at the condiment bar.  Drinks are the self-serve fountain variety, mostly Coke brand. I'm not a huge fan of horchata but it's of note that they have lots of flavors you don't see everywhere.  Others have explained the multi-line system so I won't go into detail, only to echo that when it's busy (in other words all the time), having to get in line multiple times to order different food and then pay for it causes your food to end up lukewarm by the time you get to eat it. My trick is to order only 2 tacos at a time, from only 1 window at a time, get into the pay line, sit and eat, and then get back up and go to the next window you wanted and repeat the process. Then simply lather, rinse, and repeat until full (5-6 trips for the two of us, but we're total pigs - YMMV). Keep in mind though that the traditional-sized tortillas used here are on the small side - no Taco Bell size tortillas here that fill you up with the carby part, and they don't put 2-3 tortillas per taco like they do at taco trucks.  Ordering them a few at a time gets you way too many napkins. We try to be considerate and stack up the clean ones and put them back so we don't waste too many.  The only downsides are the crazy multi-line ordering system, and they don't have tortas or corn smut.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo blew me away with their attentive staff, impossibly clean bathroom (lots of graffiti, but clean), low prices ($2 tacos), and expectation surpassing food. I had three tacos.   Steak taco was the least good. Topped with guac and salsa, interestingly the steak was somehow very smokey tasting despite them grilling it before my eyes. Had the flavor you'd get if you threw a steak into a barbeque with wood chips. The flavor was good, but seemed out of place in a taco.  Spicy pork suffers from False advertising. Not at all spicy. The pork inhabits a vertical spinning spit usually seen at your favorite Gyro spot. It's basically a take on Chinese Char Siu (Roast Pork). They've even colored it red and have a pineapple at the top of the spit which they give a squeeze to every once in a while to keep the sweet glaze going. Quite interesting, although not as juicy as I'd like since they seem to have kept mostly lean pieces.  A shame.  The chorizo is their masterpiece. you order it and they cut a link loose and burst the insides out of the casing onto the grill followed by some sauce. I'm at a loss for words, but not appetite.   If you want your mind blown, the only word you need to know when entering Tacos El Gordo is Chorizo.",

I also highly suggest trying their fries, which are loaded with meat and cheese!

    "text": "If I could give this place zero stars I would. What is the hype about this place?!! Please read the rest (im generally very adventurous with new eating places) and take my review seriously.   First of all the wait was ridiculous. Having to wait in each separate line for a meat is just crazy..who wants to wait in one line for over 30 minutes to get one type of taco and then go wait in another line for a different meat taco..no one! It was extremely hot and felt like no air conditioning was being ran. Service was terrible and very very slow. My wife and I were thinking if the line is so long it must be good..we couldn't have been more wrong. Tacos were soggy, meat was fatty (al pastor/adobago) and overly seasoned and I usually like al pastor back home. I honestly have made better tacos at home and I'm far from Mexican. Having to wait in a huge line to get the tacos and then wait in another line to buy a drink and pay is not efficient.   Very little amount of tables and people were rude stealing tables/chairs from other people who waited in line. I felt like I was in prison having to sweat and fight for a table and protect it from getting stolen when my wife went to get a drink. With the amount of customers they should have an attendant to making sure tables were cleaned and given to the next paying customer.   This place was the worst place my wife and I have eaten at in vegas and disappointing considering Yelp has rarely if ever lead me astray. You couldn't pay us to go back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this joint at all cost. Maybe it's better if there was no line, but in reading reviews that'd doesn't happen often.",

The el Pastor was very good, the chorizo tasted like charcoal, my husband really enjoyed the tongue. My problem with this place is the way it's set up. If you want different types of tacos you have to wait in different lines. So we had to wait in the el pastor line, then again in a huge line for chorizo then a third line for Tongue. By that time our food was getting cold, people are rude here trying to cut in front of you. Then we waited in a fourth line to pay and by that time we had eaten two of our tacos while waiting. The woman at the register was pissed and I told her how many we had and paid for them, she was still rude. Won't be going back here again. It's a shame because the food is pretty decent.",

Taco's El Gordo definitely sets the bar high. I've tasted tacos close to the border of Mexico in San Diego and all over Los Anegeles but none can compare to the flavors of El Gordo.   Drinks: You have your selection of Soda's and tea's but also you have Mexican soda's and lets not leave out the horchata.   Atmosphere: It's High school cafeteria style. You stand in line order what you want and then you go and pay at the cashier. Simple as that. This location has tables inside and out. The outdoor patio makes you feel like you're really in Tijuana Mexico.   Tips: Keep in mind what line you stand in, they have different lines for different tacos with different cuts of meat. Also this place is located on the strip so expect Late night diners that I call \"drunkeats\".",

Same recos - spicy pork is solid, almost like chinese bbq pork. Lengua is good too. Spicy pork fries are $10 and massive enough will feed an army of children (or hungry men,  whomever you have). Even the half size lengua fries are massive, but the pork is better,  unfortunately only comes in large.",

Came here on a Friday evening with high expectations as I was in the mood for some good old Mexican food. I guess I can say I'm lucky to have had AMAZING Mexican food from LA, OC, to San Diego and this by far cannot compare. The ONLY item that I would recommend here is Adobada. The other items I tried: carne asada fries (bland, totally NOT WORTH IT), and carne asada taco. However, I'm not that adventurous and they did have cabeza and lengua on the menu. If your into that then maybe those are worth a try! Simple menu. DIRT cheap and fairly clean. There are several lines for you to put your order. Once you've received your food you go back to the register to purchase the items.  After such a disappointment I probably would not go out of my way to return.",

It looks like it has potential as the guy was chopping and dicing right in front of you before he assembles your small tacos for $2. Did not expect guac on the tacos, but it was there in a dominating fashion over the meat. The meat itself was good in two of the three tacos, but number three took a dive and was unedible. The meat was undercooked, fatty and chewy all at the same time. All the other meats at this place belong on Bizzarre foods and the carne asada looks like it is very hit and miss.",

Anywhere else in the world, this would cost a taco shop a star in my book, but in Vegas, it's almost a welcome break!

But what do you do when you're in Vegas? Sure they have great restaurants open 24/7 but what if you absolutely need your nightly dose of tacos...  you come here.  Amazing. So good you'll want to order some to-go after you finished you're meal and suggest to your friends to come back the next morning (well that's at least what I did).  Whatever you get, it's gonna be a party in your mouth.   Personal faves - Adobada and Carne Asada tacos and tostadas. The tostadas are a little different here, not what you're used to if you're an El Taurino fan. But the flavors are so intense and rich it is the perfect meal intoxicated or sober. Ask for the side of peppers and green onions as well! And don't forget that orange bang!  Cheap, delicious, open late - what more can you ask for? Yes, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas but this one was too good to not share.",

With the exception of going to TJ (I go to TJ at least 4 times a year) these are the best Taco's I have ever tasted and I go to a lot of Taco joints. Going to Vegas means going to Taco's El Gordo. What you need to get out of all the posts are that the Adobada sometimes also called Al Pastor (Pork - Not spicy at all even though they say it is) is perfection in a corn tortilla. Let me be clear I am not a fan of pork and I don't make a habit of eating it but the things this place does..... when it hits the lips. What makes this epic is the Guacamole Sauce that they put in it. Everyone I take has always loved it. For those daring enough to handle the wait you will always agree.... worth the wait. Oh and can't miss my shout out for the Asada Fries, think Nachos but with fries instead of tortilla chips.",

    "text": "I came to Vegas in a funk--  I was moody, irritable, high maintenance, stressed out, and basically being the breeziest b I could possibly be to my boyfriend and friends.    To add the topping to my cake of misery, we had to check out of the Palms after 2 hours of sleep, and move to....   CIRCUS CIRCUS.  I considered myself victim of the worst decision made by my group-mates trying to save some money.    For those of you who are unfamiliar with Circus Circus... It is a \"family\" establishment to bring your children and let them run rampant and screaming without supervision in a dingy, low-ceilinged, un-ventilated horror of plastic clowns that haven't been cleaned since they were installed.  If there was a space capacity, there must be some sort of fire ordinance because you are unable to walk through the lobbies without dodging families who have too many children to keep track of, underage girls who are trying to grow up too quickly, and vendors who are trying to sell you belts and accessories made in Vietnam.  2nd hand smoke and dirty money was my perfume of the day.  So maybe you can understand my frustration about my predicament.  So when I yelped a nearby place to escape to, I settled on Tacos El Gordo.  This placed changed my entire perspective on the trip.  ADOBADA  ALL DAY ERR' DAY  Holy-- I got Adobada Tacos, Adobada Quesadilla, and ordered some Carne Asada fries for the table.   The staff runs a jovial assembly line, where you order your items and they each take an assignment.  It comes with grilled veggies (especially the green onions) which were so bomb I was eating them long after my stomach was maxxed out.  The tacos had it RIGHT.  Perfect blend of all textures-- meat was savory, vegetables crisp, and tortilla fresh.  Quesadilla followed suit, and then topped off with my fries.  Best carne fries I have ever had.  Price was way too fair!  I tipped them 5 dollars in the jar because I was so impressed with everything.  The workers were experiencing a mid-day lull in traffic, and each of them began cleaning everything-- I saw one of the ladies even get on a ladder and clean the ceiling. They were jamming out on their radio music, and singing loudly.  I loved the warmth!  I walked out feeling like this trip could be good!  Staying at awful Circus Circus brought me within walking distance to this place, and I was instilled with hope.  If you are in town, you HAVE to go here.",

Nothing beats these Tacos Estillo Tijuana!!!",

So we decided to give it a try for a cheap dinner.  Glad we did!  To order, you walk up to the counter.  Read the signs because each section is for certain types of meat.  First time thru we ordered tacos de asada...the guy who prepared them was friendly and fast!   They were so yummy that we went back for more and decided to try the al pastor and the chorizo.  Delicious!   With sodas and 3 tacos each, we paid about $15.  Really good deal for really good street tacos!  We'll eat here again for sure.",

I used to go to the other branches, but this is now my favorite, being on the strip and all.  I'm currently vacationing in Australia right now, and I've been craving and dreaming of their adobada and carne asada tacos.  That'll be the first thing I'm gonna eat, when I get back to my Las Vegas home!  Keep doing what you're doing, coz you're doing it right!  Acknowledge the positive comments, and just ignore the negative.  They're just haters.  At least the good thing is, they won't be back to spoil our fun at Tacos El Gordo!  Much love! Ciao!",

The cow tongue tacos here were hands-down the BEST tacos lenguas I've ever had in my life.  It was too spicy for me (you can ask them not to put the sauce on), and I still thought they were super delicious. I love cow tongue tacos, and these were really the best ever.  Tacos cost around $2 each, with the exception of the tacos lenguas, which were $2.25 each.  Worth it!  My brothers got the spicy pork tacos, and they said those were the best they ever ate.  They also have a bunch of other things like cow tongue fries, sopas, and other traditional Mexican foods, but I'll save that for next time.  Yep, go to this place.  Cheap good food, and it's enough to satisfy your stomach.",

Her exact words were \"this place is legit!\" and that it is!!! They are straight out  of Tijuana, Mexico. Walking in you will see 4 different lines, the longest is usually for the carne asada, but you can't forget the adobada!! I usually stick to those two since I'm not too much of a risk taker when it comes to tripa(cow intestine), lengua(tongue), or sesos(brains). The tacos all come with different toppings the asada taco has guacamole, salsa, onions, and cilantro. The cabeza comes with salsa, onions, and cilantro. The adobada matches PERFECTLY with a little pinapple! I'll also get the carne asada fries, a half portion for half the price, and thay are GREAT they have TONS of carne, shredded cheese, sour cream, avocado ranch, and guacamole. Way worth $5 bucks!!! The only reason I am taking a star is because they dont have tons of seats and they are SUPER busy =(",

I saw the person next to me order the grilled onions & peppers, so I asked for them and was surprised to find out they were free. I wish they had that on the menu because I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen someone else ask for them. We got our tacos with everything on them and the sauces were perfect.

I'll give them this -- they really do try to organize folks in there. It's kind of a free-for-all where you line up and tell the folks cooking the food what you want, which is really neat (and it definitely gets warm in there). They have four separate lines: 2 for adobado & something else on either end, and then two in the middle for sopes, chorizo, and a few more things. So, they really try to parse folks out based on what they're ordering. I wouldn't say all of the clientele was great at organizing themselves, but I gotta give it to Tacos El Gordo for trying.  There's a decent seating area, but not huge, and definitely not enough to support how busy they are, so we ended up eating on a curb in the parking lot, but it was just as well because it was gorgeous outside, and it felt more like eating street tacos, haha.   I got a chorizo taco and a carne asada taco, and my girlfriend got a carne asada sope and a quesadilla. We ate the sope and had the quesadilla later, so maybe my memory is slipping me, but they seemed exactly the same. Regardless, they were the bee's knees. The tacos were delicious, and I liked their carne asada more than their chorizo (which was good, but nothing to write home about), but the carne asada sope took the cake. So, give this place a try if you're on the strip and looking for legit street tacos...but go for the sopes.",

I love how they had two sides to place making it easier and faster to order.  I got the carne asada tacos with everything. I loves them. Reminded me of the tacos I use to eat in TJ. My bf on the other hand didn't care for them. He felt they were bland. I will agree that the meat was bland but who needs seasoning when you have salsa?!  I wish they had more locations so I wouldn't have to travel to the strip just for some great tacos. I will be coming back for more!",

They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.  The Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order   My next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.  You have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!",

Thankfully I came in on a Sunday night.. post-clubbing munchies, probs about 3 in the AM and the line was not that bad. Didn't even have the separate lines for each taco! SCORE. I guess I recommend going those hours? lolol   Okay, it's past def past bedtime and silly me couldn't even read the menu. Yup, the struggle is real. Of course I was looking for 'Al Pastor' on the menu and it was the first thing on there, up top. lol. Taco guy understood that I wanted Al Pastor and started cranking them out in front of me. V cool. I noticed (yes even drunk) that he put some meat on the tortilla in the beginning and flipped it, toasting the meat with the tortilla before flipping it again. #texture. #yas. He put more Al Pastor meat and then some standard cilantro and onions. Noms.   We also got some lengua and asada tacos. Lengua was sooo tender and so juicy. Asada ones wee also stellar. Personally, however, the Al Pastor ones were my favorite. Lengua a close second!   Highly recommended for late night cravings!!! Even better than your steak and eggs/ prime rib post-clubbing munchies. Also soo soo close.. Actually a definitely walkable distance from Encore or Surrender!",

The first line to the left when you enter the doors is for beef tacos, the line on the right next to it we got the spicy abodaba taco, on the corner of that on the right is the lengua taco, and then the carne asada fries on right of that section.  Confusing but you'll probably see it when you enter the restaurant. We ordered half a carne asada fries and it was definitely enough for two people along with 3 lengua, 1 beef, and 1 adobada taco. The tacos ranged from $2-2.50 and the half of carne asada was only $5. We also ordered a horchata which was good too! Seatings are outdoors and we found seats pretty quick but it was so humid sitting outside. Will be back since it wasn't too expensive compared to other restaurants on the strip.",

We usually get them to go and even after the drive home, they taste so amazing. We only ever get the spicy pork tacos and they are so flavorful and come with the yummiest sauce. Sometimes we also get lengua friends and oh my god the meat is so tender and the toppings just go so perfectly with it. Try the spicy pork tacos!!!",

If it's street food guess what your not paying for high end cuts of meat, this is not a filet mignon taco, It's carne asada, asada means charbroiled if you didn't know that we'll that explains the \"crispy\" meat as mediocre people called it. The different lines for each meat? well each different cook is assigned a meat station due to the high volume of customers that LAS VEGAS STRIP brings. Moronic reviews obviously come from those that don't know what a taco stand is... It is not a 5 star dining experience, nor a food digest experience. If you are so uppity go somewhere else where your gonna get your bunghole hair braided and the constant \"how is everything guys?\" Experience. Tacos el Gordo is kind enough to come all the way from Tijuana Mexico to give you Anglos a small taste of a what a real taco should be.   Now bow. Suck it up or go stand in line at a buffet to eat food that's lamp heated and cloned.",

The other location has much more inside seating than this one, but the food is still just as good. One of my friends and I came straight after work and had to sit outside under the covered seating. It was 110 outside, but a couple of those tacos and a small order of carne asada fries to share makes anything bearable. Do not forget a cup of ice cold horchata to wash it all down.   I would not normally lean towards Mexican food unless nudged in that direction by friends, but I am glad that I have some people who do enjoy this fare. Every once in a while, a trip to Tacos El Gordo does well for the soul. For some reason, I throw out most of my concerns with this establishment. What? You do not serve any veggies with your tacos? Okay, as long as you pile up that spit roasted meat, I will easily overlook it. What is that sauce you are dousing over my tacos? Whatever, it is just delicious, so keep it coming. By the time I am finished, I have ingested more than I normally would allow, I drank some of my calories and it is not getting me buzzed. Oh, how I have fallen. Yet it feels so good.

    "text": "So I was in Vegas with my wife. We didn't want to spend $50+ on overpriced, average food (if you haven't noticed the prices on food in restaurants in Vegas has gotten outrageous).   So I checked out yelp for some good cheap eats. Tacos El Gordo pops up as the #1 or #2 spot. We decide what the hell, let's go check it out.   Verdict: not only is their Adobada pork taco the best taco I've ever had, their Adobada pork sope was even more ridiculous. Look, i eat Mexican a lot. My wife is Mexican and I know authentic Mexican food. This place shits on every taco you've ever had. It's that good. The carne asada was above average but in hindsight I wish I would have skipped it and gotten more Adobada tacos or sopes. If you don't know what a sope is, try one. It's basically a soft, fat corn tortilla. It's like a gordita (and no, not like a taco bell gordita; those don't remotely resemble a real gordita).   If you want to eat for under $25 for two, eat the best taco or sope you'll ever have, and impress your friends with some real local knowledge... Eat at Tacos El Gordo. And after you eat and hit the casinos/clubs and you're sloppy drunk, go back and eat more. That's what I did. If there were one of these where I live I'd eat there 365 days a year and that's no bullshit. It's that good people. I think the meat is roasted by a crack pipe. It's seriously addicting.  I would consider giving up sex and becoming a priest to eat it daily.  If I were on death row I'd ask for Tacos El Gordo for my last meal.  If aliens landed tomorrow I'd take them to Tacos El Gordo to show them human cuisine and I'm pretty sure I would save the planet from total annihilation because they'd know the human race is rad because we can cook the shit out of some pork.   Don't be a dummy, just do as I say and eat there. You can thank me later.",

The carne asada here is insanely tender so these fries are a lot more satisfying than the carne asada fries back home. - Carne asada tacos: I love that these tacos come with guac and pico de gallo!  - Lengua tacos: My favorite!!! The lengua is the best meat here! So tender! - Spicy pork tacos: I like the creamy sauce that compliments the meat. And of course, the meat is tastyyyy. Yum!

    "text": "When my friend Jay F picked me up from the McCarran International, our first order of business was food, and that food was tacos. As you can see from his glowing reviews, this is a Top 10 Vegas spot for him. And if you are a foodie who loves authentic street food, this will be INSTANTLY be a Top 10 Vegas spot for you too.  The small and unassuming taco stand is on the side of a small shopping center tucked away in a corner off the strip within sight of The Wynn. And for about 1/10th of the price of meals on The Strip, you'll probably get your best meal on or around The Strip. The Abodaba is spicy pork that is cooked on a rotisserie like gyro meat would be, and is then sliced to order. Amazing. And if you like the jiggly pieces, they've got Beef Head, Beef Brains, Beef Tongue, Pork Stomach, and Tripe.   Not being much for the jiggly parts - except for beef tongue, that is - I ordered the lengua, adobada, and asada. At $2.00 each ($2.25 for tongue) these were amazing tacos, filled with meat, each with a unique garnish, and served with a huge plate of grilled veggies as additional garnish. It was an awesome amount of fresh, authentic Mexican street food for $6.25.   As I told my friend, this is the type of place that Tony Bourdain would go nuts over on one of his shows ... great cheap street food with lots of the jiggly bits offered. And this is a must-stop for all future Vegas visits.",

    "text": "This is a chain of Mexican fast food joints. There are at least two in Las Vegas, and god knows how many elsewhere. The one on the Strip is on the same side of the street as Wynn and Encore, and a little further north.  ***The Menu*** You can order quesadillas, tostadas and such, but most of the menu is tacos: taco de asada (steak), adobada (spicy pork), tripa (tripe) and a host of others. Tacos are small (around 3 to 4 inches in diameter), with a heaping tablespoonful of meat, cilantro and other spices in the center. Two tacos make for a modest lunch; four would be a hearty dinner.  ***The Atmosphere*** Pretty much like any other fast food restaurant. There are a few tables inside, and many more outside.  ***My Meal*** I've only eaten one lunch here, so I can't comment on much of the menu. However, I am hopeful. I tried two tacos: taco de cabeza (beef head); taco de buche (pork stomach). The taco de cabeza wasn't as unusual as it sounds. In taste and texture it was pretty much like minced steak. I liked it, and think it would please most people. The taco de buche was by far my favorite: lots of flavor and good texture. To wash it down, I had a bright red, strawberry soda.  ***Summary*** After one meal, I want to go back. The tortillas are good, the fillings are good, and there are lots more to try.  ***The Bill*** The meal was $5.72, for two tacos, a soda, and tax.",

    "text": "Visited Tacos El Gordo last Saturday at 11 AM. The place was already packed and the security guard lady was already giving people directions on how to order their tacos (unheard of if you go to the Tijuana location). The lines were not very clear and the menu was hard to see because of the decor hanging from the ceiling.  I had my usual, tacos de carne asada. They looked and tasted legit! So the wait was worth it. Corn tortillas were handmade, salsa and guacamole on point and asada cooking over fire. I truly enjoyed my tacos and wished I had order 6 instead of just 4. I was very disappointed that they didn't have Mexican Coca-Cola or Fanta. They only have canned sodas and a fountain drink machine. Tacos were $2.25 each and the fountain drink was $2.00 (cheapest meal on the strip I tell you).  ***  Decided to come back on Sunday before heading back home. Well, they say they open at 9 AM, but in reality they didn't start serving people until 9:30 Am ( I waited about 45 minutes outside...the smell of the asada I tell you). When we finally got to order I ordered 5 asada tacos, well I noticed that the guacamole was missing, so I asked where is the guac? The taco man replied \"we don't have any until the evening.\" I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they did not have an essential ingredient on their tacos yet again they still charged me full price.   After a mixed experience, here is a rundown of my review and suggestions for the owner:  - Food: Come over in the evening for tacos. I will never come at opening time, they were not ready to serve their clients. The wait is worth it later in the day when the tacos will be served with all the ingredients. Owner: Make sure you got EVERYTHING ready for your customers at opening time.  - Service: The women who work behind the cash register and the cleaning ladies, they were pretty cold, no smile, no \"how you doing?\" The taquero, no smile, but hey, thanks for making me some delish tacos.  - Location: Not enough area to sit inside/outside. I understand that it gets super crowded inside, therefore, have something like a long bar table area outside. I don't mind eating tacos standing up, but at least have a surface where I can put my plate and drink while I eat.  The way they separate the ordering areas by meat...please get rid of this. It causes confusion and unnecessary extra long lines for one type of taco. Instead, open at least three stations that serve all type of tacos, mulitas, etc. Also, don't have the security lady directing people where to go. I witnessed her running people out of the place by telling them that the line for asada was too long. Instead, have her do her job of making sure people don't steal tacos or get into a fight only. Also, clear the menu view...we get it, we love Mexico, but having \"banderitas\" hanging all over the place? obstructing the menu? not cool.  Overall, I will return next time I visit Las Vegas.",

They're not the most endearing people but how can you be when there's always a line out the door? They're super efficient and precise. It is a little loud but it's part of the experience.",

    "text": "This place has amazing tacos, but there are definitely pros and cons you should know before you come...  PROS: the tacos are absolutely incredible and the reason for the 5-star review. They are also cheap!   CONS: the ordering system can be flawed, especially if you go alone. The line to order is generally out the door, and you are separated into different lines as you get closer depending on the meat you want. If you want two different types of meat, you must line up TWICE at different stations to get your tacos. Then you line up again to pay. This whole process took my partner 20 mins from when he was served the first taco. Needless to say it was cold by the time he sat down to eat. Bring a friend if you want the process to go smoothly so you can wait in separate lines!",

    "text": "I didn't get anything to get here because I was recovering from food poisoning. But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.  However, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long.   As we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times. It feels like there has to be a better way for them to do this!",

My boyfriend and I ordered the al pastor & carne asada tacos along with carne asada fries. There was more than enough food for both of us. We were really shocked at how busy they were though. I went to wait in line for a table while he went to line up and order. It took about 30 minutes to finally get our food and it was well worth the wait. I noticed that mostly everyone had tacos and they don't offer burritos. What I liked most about this place was that even though with their outdoor seating, they had heaters and a tent to cover around all the tables. It made our meal much more enjoyable.  Parking wasn't a problem since there was a parking lot nearby. Can't wait until the next time we're back in Vegas! We plan on coming back.",

    "text": "WHY DID I NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE SOONER???  What's wrong with me! I'm usually on top of these things, and I've been missing out this entire time. During my trips to Vegas, I spend most of my time at Encore and for the longest time I did not know about Tacos El Gordo. The boyfriend heard from a friend about this place, because it was one of his favorite places in Vegas in terms of food.   ARE WE AT THE ZOO? The boyfriend and I came during lunch, and the place was a zoo!!! Where to order your food may be quite confusing at first, but if you look there are signs at each station that tell you what they're making. So, you just go to the correct station and tell them what you want, and they'll make it for you.   While we were waiting for our tacos, I noticed an employee wiping the stainless steel walls by the grill stations down with a towel. Then my eyes started to wander around the entire kitchen, and I noticed that the ENTIRE KITCHEN WAS SPOTLESS! Holy crap!! This place was clean as hell, which means NO DIARRHEA. YES!!!  After we were given all the food we ordered, we walked over to one of the two cashier stations to pay for the food. Yes, so you get your food first and then bring your tray to a cashier where they will ring you up. This is where you can order your drinks.   OUTDOOR SEATING With the number of people inside, I was surprised that there was a good number of tables available. I was expecting the table and seats to be filled with leftover food from the people who previously sat there, BUT there was nothing. Again, spotless! The tables are sitting under a big tent, so don't worry about birds crapping on your head or trying to steal your food.   LUNCH IS MY FAVORITE PART OF THE DAY Between the boyfriend and I, we had one spicy pork taco, 3 carne asada tacos and one half order of their carne asada fries. I've been to so many taco trucks and taquerias in San Francisco, and usually the dirtier the place the better it tastes. But Tacos El Gordo was clean, and it tasted even better than most of the taco trucks and taquerias I've been to in SF!! =X   CONCLUSION Like I said many times in this review, and I'll say it again, this place is very clean. Even their stainless steel garbage cans sitting outside are clean, not a spot to be found! With that being said, if you're afraid of getting mud butt, Hersey squirts, bubble guts, the runs or whatever else you want to call it, because you've eaten dirty tacos from a dirty taco truck or taqueria, you won't have to worry here! You can get the same delicious tacos without worrying about having the run to the bathroom later. Haha, that sounded like a commercial.   Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back for more tacos in the future. I love tacos, and I love that there is a legit place on The Strip I can go to, to get it! :) I want a taco now.",

I can imagine the line can be a long wait if you arrive at peak hours but we waited about 20 min at 11:00pm. They have one line but multiple stations and you just order at each station the food you want and pay at the cashier near the exit. Seating is limited.  Be sure to ask for the grilled onions and hot chili peppers (green one has a lingering kick so be careful)  The Mrs and I ordered abodaba and asada and they had guacamole, onions, and cilantro for an awesome $2.00 tacos each. I highly recommend this place and avoid the other touristy spots.",

After a day spent strolling around aimlessly, it was time. Time to eat. It's been a bookmark for a while now and decided we'd make a stop this time through town. We were passing right by it - so why not?  The lines were kinda hectic, at first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but after a minute, I saw that there were about 8 lines for ordering your food; direct from the kitchen staff. Watch them cook up your order, then take it to the register to pay. Pretty simple once you realize how it works. Finding a place to sit and eat on the other hand, was a challenge. Five minutes of hovering around the tables, and a spot finally opened up - this place is packed with customers enjoying their meals.  The Carne Asada tacos were excellent, but the disappointer here were the Adobada (spicy pork) fries. Usually a fan of pulled or shredded pork dishes, the Carne Asada would have likely been the better choice to top that huge mound of (half sized) fries; I certainly am glad the lady and I didn't order the large. The pork was good, just not awesome or over the top delicious - I'll plan to stick to the Carne Asada if I stop in again.  With four tacos, a (half) order of fries, and a coke our bill came to about $15 - I dare you to try and find that anywhere else on the strip for less than $30. If you do, please let me know - I'm always down for some tasty tacos.  Happy Yelping!",

From the price, the flavoring and taste of these tacos....I know I'll be addicted to these. I've already gone twice in the past week alone.  Street tacos to the max! Small in size but packed with flavoring.  This is located on the Las Vegas Strip, so all your drunk tourists can stop by here after a night of drunken nightclubbing and sober up with these tacos.  For you So Cali peeps: You know King Taco? Yeah...that infamous place with bombass carne asada tacos. Well....TACOS EL GORDO is giving King Taco a run for its money. Maybe this surpasses King Taco. Who knows? I'll let you decide. So if you had KT before, you got to try these tacos out!!!!!! These won't disappoint, I promise.",

The only complaint I have is the wait time, the lack of seating area, and the fact that if you want different meats you have to make multiple lines. Unless you're going with a lot of people you're able to get all the different tacos without having to wait for so long. Since it was me and my husband I decided to save us a seat while he ordered and the line where he was at you could only get asada and chorizo. Overall they were good but not that good to make me wait in 2 or 3 lines.",

    "text": "This is located right next the Ross, just after Cathedral Way (past the Wynn). You can't miss the hoards of people meandering in and out of here.   It's fast, cheap and good. It's got this interesting set up of 3 different counters all serving up different things on the menu, although some of the menu items repeat. So you really should know what you want to get before you stand in line somewhere. I was sober and had 4 years of high school Spanish and I was still having a hard time figuring out where to stand and what I wanted to order!   You will see all sorts of people in all sorts of dress, here, a True testament that affordable good food draws the masses. In the 30mins we sat and ate, I saw suited up limo drivers and casino security, folks in medical scrubs, construction workers, migrant workers, families who look like they just came from a quincinera, UNLVers, clubbers....and us tourist from HI in our slippers looking for a proper taco that doesn't cost $4 each.  At any rate this place is so convenient to the strip and my beloved Guardian Angel Cathedral that it will be a steady freddy everytime I'm in the 702.   Pros: -Late hours, cheap, good, easy parking, fast service, good lighting, lots of people around, no brainer for a taco fix -SPICY PORK. Yup...that's the one.  -One order carne asada fries can seriously feed 4-6 people. Watching them prepare it was ridiculous! Seriously, a mound of meat and cheese about 3 inches high just dumped on an entire fry basket of fries. WTH!  -There's a parking lot and lot's of open spaces.   Cons: -It's ain't fancy and it ain't fragrance free. So you will walk into a place where smoke from meat being roasted and things being fried is visibly hanging in the air.  -Seating can be hard to find as it's busy, but turnaround is fast",

    "text": "Now here is a favorite spot for the late night clubbing crew....    Tacos El Gordo runs all night long to cater to those party people who literally just got out of XS...... and are super hungry!  Be aware of the long lines!!!  It sort of goes quick but nevertheless it's still a long ol line to be waiting in...  Quick eats for after clubbing!  Which Taco would you like?  They are famous for the pastor taco!  Spicy Shaven pork on the spinner rotisserie is a crowd favorite!  But they also have tons of other stuff as well!  (gotta try their super nacho!  It is humongous!)  Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!  They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!  You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!  Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!  To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!  Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next time you are near!",

It was so ridiculous that I timed my waiting in lines... it took 1.5 hrs to get all the orders in and by the time I sat down to eat? The first order of carne asada tacos was stone cold.   I've had comparable if not better meats in NorCal. I am not risking losing 2 hours of my vacay time in line.

Just like how my Mexican babysitter used to make em.   The boyfriend had carne asada fries and couldn't even finish a half order...! So beware, if you want their carne asada or any other fries.. Get the half order if you're just eating them yourself! He also had their al pastor taco. He seemed to love both.   Workers were very friendly too.

It's completely frantic at lunchtime, so know the system: there's one line for the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, one for the other kinds of taco, and a third for everything else on the menu. You're going to want plenty of the divine adobada, full of meat fresh off the spit and garnished with avocado, cilantro, onions, and just a bit of tangy sauce. But you also can't miss the flavorful lengua or the tender cabeza, so your friend should stand in the other line to order those. A third person, if you have one, should grab some limes and radishes and nab one of the picnic tables outside. A happy taco feast will follow.  El Gordo is also a late night lifesaver. I think there's like 5 hours in the day when they're not open.",

I ordered 2 carne asada and 2 spicy pork tacos. then i went back and ordered 2 more spicy pork tacos.  If I were to go back I'd order 6 spicy pork tacos.  Maybe I've been on the East Coast for too long but after the first bite of the spicy pork taco I felt like weeping for joy.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place.  My must-have is the tripe taco - hands down thee best of the bunch.  This is the dish that I always order. The tripe is crunchy, yet chewy.  It may be a bit oily but that's what happens when it's deep-fried before it's minced and served. If you decide to get this or any other taco, tostada, burrito, or nachos, just make sure to get everything on it, else it just won't taste right.  You can also ask for some free sauteed scallions and peppers, which are actually quite good as a side with your dish.  Their horchata is pretty damn good, too - none of that powderiness that lingers in others's mix.   This place gets pretty packed, espcially on weekends and nights.  I couldn't imagine it any other way, though.  Well, actually I can, but it's on the strip, and the place has great food and for very decent prices. Regardless if you are drunk, coherent, strolling around the area, or hungry for some Mexican food, check this place out.",

Each line offers different type of meat. On the plus side, they give you free grilled onions and peppers!! The downside is that its super packed, and it takes awhile, especially if someone makes a big order. We ended up lining up for ~30min until we got to the front to order.  I ended up eating 3 tacos, a quesadilla and shared some carneasada fries. It was the perfect amount for me.",

I been here twice, and the employees are super cool.    It's a pretty simple taco shop, but it does the job.  The tacos are 2.00 a piece, but three of them are a good size lunch.   I really enjoyed seeing the all you can drink Orange Bang, that's one of my favorite drinks. It's a pretty clean restaurant, and you don't have long wait...even when it's busy, because the line moves very fast.    I think, I found my late night taco fix in Las Vegas.",

You could hardly breathe. So we waited in line for about 10 minutes to find out that we were in the wrong line. Still trying to be positive, we got in a line that you could only order carne.    We orders 6 carne asada tacos and carne fries. Not only did we pay about 26 bucks, the food tasted terrible. The meat was so hard and the tortillas were soaked with grease, we just left the food on the table for everybody to see. I was really surprised due to the reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day for us, but I don't think we will give it another chance.",

    "text": "This place was highly recommended. Maybe it's impressive to non-Mexicans that are tired of paying exuberant prices at the casinos, but if you come here and it's busy, walk away!   I have to hand it to the management, they really want to give the locals and visitors the authentic and chaotic atmosphere that you might experience in Tijuana. You also will need your tourist Spanish to understand the instructions given over the loud speaker. The process to order your food is ridiculous. Hopefully you know what you want and you are sticking to one type of meat, otherwise you'll be standing in multiple lines to complete your order. It took my husband an hour to order some tacos because we wanted adobada and carne asada.   The situation was bad enough to require them to tag team, so one can start eating while the other one kept their place in line. \"Stay alive, no matter what occurs!\"  So was it worth the hype? No! Carne asada and lengua were chewy and stringy. The adobada had the best flavor, but not good enough to return and endure this chaos once again. Tacos el Gordo should be named Tacos el Tonto! Tontos for standing in line for mediocore tacos. Adios!!",

The real problem here is that the lines make NO SENSE. Why the hell do you have 4 lines for different types of meat? If you want to try the different meats you have to wait in four damn lines. Then you get your food and you have to wait in another damn line. It make makes NO SENSE.  You could easily grab your food go sit and eat and not pay, they would never know.  TACOS EL GORDO, I recommend that one of your employees should be a customer and have to wait in every line and order one taco of each type of meat on a busy night and hopefully you will realize how crazy it is to have to wait in five lines.  Maybe this way you will fix your line situation. 5 damn lines, unbelievable!!!!!",

I can't imagine how shitty it must be during peak hours. The worse thing is, there are drunk bros taking over seats with piles of trash on their table and they won't move.   They need rows of just elevated tables. So you can just hang out and eat. That's it. No sitting around and taking space. Get in, eat, get out. More room and less clutter. The very few tables there sucked too. Everything is too tight and people fight over the chairs.",

There was a security guard outside telling people they has to wait outside for the line to go down but there's also a menu out there so when you do finally get in you know what you want! It's hectic, there's around 5 or 6 separate lines some are only for ordering specific things & then a whole other line you have to wait in to pay at the register. When you get up to the order window you tell them what you want & it's made fresh right there in front of you. Quick grab & go. The line to pay is pretty quick & if you're with a group I suggest you have someone keep a look out for a table cause it's hard to find one.   Asada tacos are so bomb!!! We all bought enough to share but really I just wanted them all to myself lol ! You gotta be patient if you're gonna come here but it's worth it. Just keep reminding yourself that it has to be delicious because of how busy it is lol ! Definitely a go to spot when I'm in vegas & I need a taco fix.",

The lines are long, I say lines because you have to wait in one to just walk in the door after you get in there's 4 other lines where they have different type of tacos, sopes, carne asada fries...etc. Not much seating inside so we ended up sitting outside on some fake grass. Overall bomb tacos I'd definitely would come back and like my cousin said \"I don't wait in line to get in a club but I'll wait in line for some tacos el gordo\"  Taco Bell ain't got ish on this spot.....just saying",

Make sure you're in the right line because they have different lines for different meats.   Payment system is very interesting... it is based on honor system/cafateria style where you order in one spot and pay later in a different spot.

It was crazy hot waiting to get inside but there was a little shade so it wasn't the worst I guess.   We probably waited a good 40-45 minutes and they ran out of spicy pork by the time we ordered :( The tacos are around $2-2.50 and topped with guac and salsa and a generous portion of meat on each. Each order is made on the spot and it's pretty crazy how fast the workers make the tacos we ordered like 10 tacos and it took him less than a 1 min!  We also ordered carne asada fries (LARGE! $13) which for the price, probably isn't as worth it as ordering more tacos but it was still soooo good as drunchies the next morning hehe.   Definitely try the beef tongue tacos they were juicier than the carne asada. We also got the chorizo tacos which were good, but not at the same level as the others. Next time, we'll be back just for the spicy pork!  But definitely, some of the best tacos/Mexican food I've ever had but prepare for a WAIT!",

Hands down I like this better than any place in California, Midwest, and east coast we have tried so far. We also had the lengua, tripa, and buche tacos all with  lengua fries!! Everything was delicious but our favorite was the adobada spicy pork tacos with flour tortilla.",

    "text": "It was pretty confusing.  There are separate lines for different types of meats or fries.  Stand in the line of the meat you want to order and don't be a noob like me and stand in the shortest line.  I realized there were separate lines once I looked up and noticed that there were signs haha.   VAMPIRO:  I ordered an asada vampiro. It's kind of like a tostada with melted cheese and a special salsa.  It was really good.  The crispiness of the tostada and the taste of the melted cheese is an awesome combo!!  CARNE ASADA TACOS: A safe choice.  And I wasn't disappointed. These met my standards and were comparable to the taco trucks in LA.  It's pretty cool to experience and it's pretty affordable.  As chaotic as it gets in there, they have a decently organized system.  Seating is available outside under their covered patio.  Parking can also be limited, but we got lucky during the time we went. I definitely want to come back and try their carne asada fries!!",

    "text": "For our very first wedding anniversary, my husband took me to Las Vegas! I had never been before, therefore I do what I do when I'm somewhere new... Yelp places to eat! It was lunch time and we always agree on taqueria's... Tacos El Gordo caught our attention immediately. The pictures and videos of the Abodaba, the grilled veggies and nopales (a personal fav. of mine...) beckoned us down the strip. We just couldn't pass it up and I'm so glad we didn't!  I've never had Abodaba, or meat prepared like this for Tacos...the closest is Mediterranean shawarma....when it's vertically standing and spinning! As they cut the meat down into the hand made tortillas I couldn't help but smile ear to ear! They probably thought I was insane! Maybe just crazy for these tacos!!! My husband got Carne Asada tacos as did I, however I also ordered the Abodaba's tacos which there was NO WAY I was passing up! We also ordered the Nopales. The tacos were amazing. The meat was in huge chunks, the tortillas were so flavorful... You can't beat watching a woman kneading dough and making tortillas right in front of you, only to be passed off and have a man slice huge chunks of pork off this thing, and make you the best damn tacos you've ever had!!! And that's saying a lot ... The flea market tacos here in Reno are seriously a close second!   I'm already eager to drive the 7hours back just for these tacos...orrr... They could open one here in Reno!!! A girl can dream!!",

Once you walk in there's like 5 different lines to order your food from depending what meat you're choosing. So as any smart person would do we split up so we can order all meats. Upon finally receiving my food and paying (45 minutes later) we sit down to eat. I was in the tripa, cabeza, lengua line. I had my friend order me carne asada fries since he was in that line. *fast forward* we pay and now eating... when one of the workers comes up to me and States \"you didn't pay for the fries\" I said Uhm I didn't but my friend did as he was in that line. She made a scene until we showed her the receipt and she walked away no apology nothing. The f*cking nerve! Les deve de dar verguenza, tanto dinero que hacen y salen con esas mamadas? Will never come back here again, and this isn't the first time they do this (not to me but other patrons) save your TIME and money and go eat somewhere else.",

My family and I got there at midnight and the place was packed with people who had left bars or nightclubs. Whooo hoo only in Vegas.  Minus star because the AC was put on super super cold temperatures. My aunt had to take her tacos to the car because of the cold temperature.  Overall, good tacos. Not the greatest!",

    "text": "I don't see what everyone is talking about!  First off their ordering system sucks! You have to wait in three different lines depending on which meats you want. By the time you get your food from one line and have to order in the other your food is cold.  Then you still have to wait in another line to pay. Second, they use chuck steak!  A carne asada taco consists of flap skirt/Ranchera meat.  Third, the al pastor tasted like a piece of sweet thanksgiving ham and they smothered it with a green moco looking sauce. Fourth, the lengua was kept in a boiling pot of lard.  Lengua is boiled then kept steamed, not kept warm in lard.  The tripas tasted like they were not clean and when I asked if they were crispy he said, \"yes\", but were soggy.  The cabeza was also kept in the lard to keep warm.  I know mexican and this was not!  I come from Guadalajara where the street tacos are amazing and when I seen they had \"Vampiros\" I was super excited. Until they came out.  The cheese was not good and they packed it with a pound of pico de gallo that made what should have been a crispy tostada a soggy tortilla!  Will NEVER return!",

    "text": "GROSS!! Where do I begin. I was hoping for some awesome food. My homies from work had mentioned about going here. I decided to finally give it a try. They said delicious and huge stuffed tacos. Cool, im a taco kind of guy. You walk in it a normal place. Old style fast food kind of place. The menu is basic, tacos with different kinds of meat. I saw meats I wouldn't touch but knew enough to choose the Carne Asada, Spicy Pork, and Pork Tacos. Staying away from the tongue and other things that are scary and gross tasting to me lol. Anyways, I get my order, pay and get a drink. I should of figured something was up when one of my tacos was covered in foil. I sit down and start on the Carne Asada taco. Pretty decent, mild flavor and hardly any fat. The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy. Cool, Im thinking maybe the spicy pork taco should even be better. It to was decent. Nothing spicy about it. It was more colored pink as an illusion to spicyness I guess. Kinda bland in flavor. Im starting to think that this place isnt as good as my friends said. Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco. Which are small and not worth the price. They werent even stuff like the name claims lol. I take off the foil to the last taco. Its the Pork Taco so I thought. It was fatty, smelt weird and had greyish chunks in it. the texture looked like some kind of sea creature. I asked an employee is this pork? Not pork tonuge or kidney or some strange animal part, just is this PORK? She said yes. I took a piece of the so called pork and took a small bite. THATS NOT PORK!! If it is, they have some nasty ideas what pork is. I think some health inspectors need to investigate and see what they are selling as Meat, especially the pork. Eat at your own risk, this is one place I will never, ever go to again!! Until next time, Let's Eat!!",

I decided to wait it out because I was psyched for tacos de asada. 10 minutes later I hadn't moved. But, I was free today and the folks around me in line were fun. An hour and 10 minutes later, I got my food. All I can say is, it was worth the wait! The tacos de asada were delicious!! They grill the carne asada right there over charcoal. I've never seen kitchen staff working so fast and having so much fun. I love an open kitchen and it helped pass the time. First time I've ever seen someone throw the ingredients for a taco in the air and catch them.. For EACH TACO!  Just FYI (in case you don't speak Spanish), there are two lines... one if you are ordering tacos de asada and another line for everything else. The line for everything else seemed to move faster. If I can make time, I might go back and try the adobada.  Great find, I just wish it wasn't quite so \"discovered\".",

If you go to Mexico city, you will see the identical tacos I promise you. It's always packed so be prepared to sit outside. During the early afternoon hours and summertime, it really is a committment to sit outside under their tent and eat tacos while sweating but to me its completely worth it. I love how the stuff is always fresh because its always at capacity. I also like how they just put all the onions, cilantro, and sauces depending on the taco you order so it makes it that much quicker to get your food and get to eating. Been in two times out of two times I've been in Vegas and wouldn't hesitate to come a 3rd time next time. Definately recommend.",

Stop by this location if you're a tourist. If you're local, try one of the other locations (cuz tourists clog this one up )",

    "text": "The tacos are good but they definitely run the LV Strip taco scene because there just isn't much competition around.   Tips:  +Don't waste your time and money ordering Asada! They don't season their meat as well as they should and the taco ends up tasting bland.   +Make sure you stand in the proper line for the tacos you want. Each line has a sign above it indicating which tacos they make. If you're with multiple people, split up and order your tacos because the food gets cold quick.  +The al pastor is a must, it's pretty much their best tasting meat option.  +If you're here as a group, have someone save your group a table because this place is always busy and by the time you get your food and sit down, your tacos are cold.  I definitely think they need to change the way they order food here. They go by this whole \"honor system\" where you order your tacos and then you stand in line to pay for your tacos. The lady at the cash register counts your tacos and items and then gives you a grand total. Imagine if I ate a few in line? I'm sure they lose out on a lot of $$ here.   And what is up with their Quesadilla?? I thought I was going to get two hand made tortillas with a fresh piece of melted cheese in between and of course my meat in the middle. Instead I received this twist on a quesadilla which turned out to be ONE tortilla, meat and cheese and a tortilla chip on top. The round tortilla chip was almost about the size of the hand made tortilla (meaning it was tiny). Common man, how can you mess up on a quesadilla??!   Overall, please be patient when coming here and don't be alarmed when you see a line out the door for tacos. Order the al pastor and you won't be too disappointed.",

I got a half size of the Adobada fries, two carne Asada tacos (they make the tortillas fresh in front of you!), a carne Asada quesadilla, and the Vampiro. My favorite item on the menu was the Vampiro, it was absolutely delicious! Abodaba meat, veggies, and heavy sauce all packed between two crispy, chip like tortillas. Our total cane to $21.09 for two adults and that included two horchatas. Good bang for your buck and you know it's legit when everyone inside eating is Mexican! Can't wait to come back and indulge again.",

    "text": "When I found out there was a Tacos El Gordo in Vegas, I just about...\"you know what...\" hahaha.    I've already been to this location a few times now since I go to Vegas more often than I go to SD....and just like the SD one...I am NEVER disappointed.  One of the BEST taco places...EVER, and now Vegas has once again taken another great resto and placed it in a location where you can access so many other must-eats all within a few miles of each other.  As always, make sure you know what you're doin...pay attention to the lines...make sure you know which line to get into.  We're always with a group and we all want the different tacos, so we each get in a line and just order for the group...trust me, that's the best way to attack it...and the best way for everyone to get the best of all worlds.  I can't remember exactly which lines have which tacos, but you'll figure it out when you see them.  EVERY line is long, and the location makes it such that the line goes straight out the door.  My absolute favorites are the lengua, abodabo, and the al pastor and even the cabeza is pretty darn tasty.  If you want a quesadilla, you can add that to your order from any line, so don't worry about that.  Roughly $3 a taco, and i can eat about 4 and be decently full...maybe fit a quesadilla in there.  And I'm good good.  The tortillas are made in-house, which I love! You can see the lady rolling and frying the tortilla -- yes, it's that fresh.   Seating here is a little more spacious than SD, but still quite limited.     Not really much to say about service staff...polite and friendly enough, and you get what you need. They deal with high turnover, so don't expect them to be too patient.     Parking...tough, it's on the strip, so if you're going during busy time...good luck.  It's near that catholic church near the strip and has a small lot, so uber, lyft, or walk.  It's walking distance from Palazzo, where I usually stay, and esp after gorging on some good food, you'll wanna walk it off anyway.     A definite MUST!",

Smoke and steam and yelling and people of all stripes waiting in line. It took me a few minutes to figure out the system of waiting in line according to what meat you want, and then paying for your meal at a separate counter. I was not daring enough to try some of the more exotic meats, so I went for the adobada (spiced pork). Waiting for my turn I got to watch several orders of these tacos get made. They have layers of marinated pork turning on a vertical rotisserie that is first skewered with whole pineapples. As the meat turns and heats, all that juice saturates the pork. The guy making the tacos would take a long knife and just carve down the face of the turning meat, getting enough shavings for one taco. Really fun to watch. I got two and found a place to sit in their outside tent. They were the best tacos I have ever tasted. I don't know if they're the best out there, but not being from the southwest or California, they opened up a whole new world for me. I immediately got back in line for two more.",

    "text": "Any time I have come here in the past year, it has always been amazing food. You probably will have to wait 30 minutes for your meal, but it is so worth it. The best item to get is the al pastor meat. I just enjoy all the fixings on my taco. Be careful you get in the correct line for your meat liking. They have separate lines that indicate where to go, and usually have someone at the door asking you what meat you want so you get in the correct line. I love the carne too, all the fixings on that one too. The \"fixings\" vary if I am correct, but its usually something like- a salsa/dressing, cilantro, and chop raw white onion. How they make their quesadillas are fun to try, it is not a typical huge flour tortilla, it is very small like the taco tortillas, and has a chunk of semi-melted cheese, and I chose to add meat. The fries are amazing, but a little lack luster compared to just getting a taco, and enjoying the meat for its flavor. I need to come back here asap, haha.  Pro Tips; 1. As some people I'm sure mentioned, if your in a group, break into the different lines to order the different meats. 2. Try to avoid peak times like 4PM-9PM... I know thats prime eating time, but if you are starving, just chug water and cleanse yourself. 3. It is not fancy, and the service is just is what it is. It is so busy they focus on the quality of food, and for that I'm a happy camper.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo is maybe a 5 minute walk from the Wynn/Encore.  Safe to say I always stagger on over after spending the night at XS.  There are multiple lines once you get in, there are signs that will say what meat is being prepared in what line.  I typically go get in the Lengua taco line because its always the shortest.  The al pastor or abodabo tacos are also amazing.  The abodabo fries are SO BOMB.  They have some delicious avocado/sour cream sauce all over.  The lengua tacos and carne asada tacos are also very good.    They have an awesome salsa bar with plenty of limes, salsa, pickled carrots etc.  The soda machine has some awesome selections like pina and horchota!  You order at the food prep line and get to watch the guys make your food fresh!  Sometimes you'll wait on the side for the fries.  But all the food is made fresh!  You can see all the meat cooking its delicious grease and the al pastor rotating on its spiket. After you get your food, you walk to the front of the store to pay at the cashier.  Seating can look intimidating because there are always so many people but people turn in and out pretty quickly.  They have a couple employees that are hovering around to clean your table immediately after which definitely helps keep things moving.  Definitely come here!",

(I saw they also have locations in California)   Adobada tacos are the way to go with extra salsa and some limon and rabanos. The carne asada fries weren't my favorite, but hubby is obsessed! Another thing I don't like is that it seems that the way the line is set up makes things move slower, but I guess it works for them. I'm not mad. I'll wait as long as I have to for these AMAZINGGGGGGG TACOS!",

After I got in, I probably waited 10-15mins for my Pork tacos, whereas my cousin was there for at least an hour waiting for his steak tacos.  A must-do for your Vegas list, this place is an experience in itself!  North of the Encore/Wynn.  There is a friendly black female security guard who explains the \"system\" to you.  There are several lines depending on what meat you want.  The more exotic meats are quicker, so FYI.  The meat is shave, grilled on the flat-top grill, & tortillas are made right in front of you.  Then after you get your order, you walk up to the cashier to pay.   I've been to a taco place with a \"system\" like this, but not nearly half as busy as El Gordos.  So needless to say, this place needs a new system!  Asada was tastier than the Pork, but a tad on the salty side.  Guac was delicious!  Minus * because I asked for 1 Spicy + 1 Al Pastor and was given 2 Spicy, not difference between the 2 tacos.  Still good tho...",

By the time you pick what you want, you'd be approaching to order. There's so many crazy options of meat!   Taco de Adobada aka Spicy Pork with everything was amazing! The meat is shaved off a sharwarma grill & assembled right in front of you. Was disappointed I ordered only 2 tacos (they were pretty small like the Mexican street tacos) The Tamarind Horchata drink was sweet and tangy in just the right amount. The Cinnamon Horchata tasted like a iced apple cider with a twist.   My definite go to place in Vegas! Can't wait to return and get a larger order of these amazing tacos!! 5 stars for the cheap price and the tastiness!",

Being as lit as we were (and first timers), we were like screw it, no Lengua today Bc we didn't want to wait in another long line so we took our tacos to go pay and take them to go. As I'm reading other reviews now, I'm seeing that the sauce was supposed to be ASKED for at the register. Well, that pretty much was a let down Bc the tacos were below mediocre without it, the lines were freaking long, and it's confusing when you've never been there Bc you just wait in the line that's going out the door and don't think to go into the restaurant to see the other lines (obviously) ..   Don't know if I'll come back, I'm thinking of checking out tacos y tacos which I heard was on par, if not better (without the line)",

The tacos are simple and delicious. The quesadillas are not your regular quesadillas. This one comes in a small tortilla (same size as the tacos) with melted cheese and then \"everything on it\" (guac, cilantro and onions) and a piece of a tostada. Think open-faced quesadilla with a chip to scoop the goods. Tastes so good.   Definitely a go to taco spot... especially in Vegas. LOL.",

    "text": "This place is a MUST GO if you're in VEGAS.  These are probably the most authentic Mexican tacos I have had in the SW US.  They're consistently good every time I go there.    I always get the al pastor (did you know that \"adobada\" and \"al pastor\" are the same thing?? I just found out not too long ago) tacos and a couple carne asada tacos too. The tortillas are made fresh and you can taste it with every bite.  They're just the right texture and firmness.  And always warm.  The meat is top notch, so much flavor and they put a good amount in each taco.  Top it off with some lemon, red sauce, and a little bit of radish on the side- & kapoweeeeeee.... you've got yourself a BAMF taco.    There has never not been a line so expect to wait a bit for that goodness.. but so worth the wait.  Their menu is straightforward and simple so the line goes by pretty quickly.  So much appreciation for the people cooking the food and serving it because they work so hard and you can tell!  They're lightning fast with their hands and whip out tacos in minutes.  It's not easy and it's probably super hot back there so PROPS.  will ALWAYS come back !!",

They get everything right:  - Street tacos - cheap price ($2 - $5 a taco) - fantastic \"toppings\" - variety of meats from beef tongue to pastor, chorizo, asada, etc - prompt and polite service - on the strip, just a block down from Encore  The tacos here are delicious, miles better than anything I've had back in the Midwest or anywhere else for that matter, and considering El Gordo is only in a few cities it's worth the pilgrimage just for these alone.  My favorite is the El Pastor tacos, with the meat shaved off fresh right in front of you, and some mixture of green toppings that sends the senses into a warm embrace.  Warning - this place gets busy at night, so be ready for lines if that's when you arrive.  But they're open late (we've been at 3am before and during the day), so added bonus if you're having a night out on the town and need an after party spot.  Thankfully the line moves extremely fast, and you will walk away ready to plan your next trip.  Don't skip this one",

Pick the line for which meat you want most (it'll be a problem if you want different types of meat unless someone in your party is already waiting in that line). Tell them what you want for that meat (taco, mulas, quesadilla, etc). Grab your order and go to the register to the right and pay for what you ordered.  Thankfully I came with two people who had already been here and showed us the ropes! I ordered the adobada (spicy pork) quesadilla ($4). I'm pretty sure what I got was not a quesadilla. Not sure if the guy knew what he was doing? It was a taco with a small piece of crispy circular tortilla on top.. not pressed together or anything just thrown on top. We asked him what that was and he had to tell us it was the quesadilla. Very confused.. The flavors were good though. Ask for grilled onions (they give you green onions) and chili.   Parking can be somewhat of a behind depending on when you come. Many of the parking spots in front of the other tenants have parking just for their store. We came during random hours at 2:30pm and the place was still pretty crowded.",

Cut right in front of you! Heaped with onion, cilantro, and pineapple. I will definitely be stopping by every trip to Vegas to get more! My mouth is watering as I am writing this review. They have lots of options but pastor is the best!!!",

Fusing QUALITY with affordability guarantees that I'll be back each and every time I visit Vegas, whether for lunch with buddies or after we shut the club down. (Check for hours- on weekends, they close at 5AM and re-open at 9AM.)  The adobada everyone raves about- have it sliced and placed into their tortilla sammich (starts with m) with cheese that has been slightly cooked on the flat top. Just do it. It will rock your world.  Carne asada fries or adobada fries- Unless you have 3 friends with you, get the HALF. I don't know how it's humanly possible to plow through this and anything else, even if you get a half order. Biggest half order of fries I've seen in my life.  This location in particular is located in a shopping complex just north a few blocks of the Encore. Definitely make this one happen on your next trip to the Strip!",

This is the ultimate hangover food. Crisp fries, Carne Asada, cheese,  some kind of cilantro lime sauce, guac and sour cream. Very tasty!  For those who are more adventurous, My hubby had the Cabesa tacos and said they were Delicious with a capital D!  Only four stars for ambiance. Five stars for the food!!

There was a greeter that was telling customers if they wanted a certain type of dish they could go ahead and get on a different line. I gave 3 stars because this was the worst system ever. People were cutting lines and there was no order. If everyone went in and went like a cafeteria line it would save a ton of time. The food is great. Traditional cheap tacos and other authentic dishes. It's not meant to be great quality just have that authentic taste. Again wish the line system was better so if you ordering more then 1 thing your food isn't cold by the time you eat it.",

I was hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait because I was starving!   The place is right next to Encore. Towards the end of the strip. There is a red rent outside for outside seating. When you walk in there are several lines. There's a line for asada and adobada fries. A line for carne asada tacos and Mulitas and a line for adobada and al pastor Mulitas and tacos. Then a seperate line for anything with buche, suadero, and tripa, lengua. This was the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I would rather just order my food and have them call out my number when it's ready. But in a way if works for Vegas craziness.   The prices for the tacos are a bit higher than usual. Tacos are about $2. Mulitas $4, fries $10.   I tried the adobada fries and these were delicious with a decent amount of meat topped with sour cream and guacamole and cheese.  2 al pastor tacos. Topped with onion, cilantro and guacamole. So delicious. Perfect size too.   I also had a Mulita with tripas. So delicious. The Mulitas are small but since I had tacos tok I was satisfied.   This is a place you need to come to while in Vegas. The food is great and it's also affordable compared to other places on the strip. The food is also very authentic.   Besides the different lines just one other thing to complain about... The soda machine ran out of ice and it took a really long time to get ice.",

Tacos are all you really need, but I just learned that they make asada fries too, so they're on my list.

    "text": "So if it's you're first time going here..  You'll walk in & be freakin confused like me bc there are a lot of lines. So basically in there are 3-4 ? Lines on both sides of the store. Each line has a specific meat you can order. (E.g. One line for carne asada. One line for adobada). Now my tip to you guys: divide & conquer literally. Have each person in your group stand in different lines & just order for your group. After you get your food, just figure it out when you pay at the cashier.   Pros:  + everything is made fresh to order. They cook it right when you order it. + they even make their tortillas fresh!! + price 2$/taco + lots of seating available, inside & outside.   Cons:  -long, like super long lines :(  -confusing lines (why does there got to be diff lines for everything)",

    "text": "Where can you get authentic, fast, cheap tacos in Vegas? TACOS EL GORDO. There's one on charleston, but this review is for the one on las vegas blvd.  Typically $2 tacos for a variety of meats: cabeza, lengua, adobada, and many more incarnations. Sad thing is I've waited so long to have amazing, real tacos until I've been introduced. Been here many times since then.   WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE A TACOS EL GORDO VIRGIN/TOURIST: Standing around awkwardly trying to figure out where to order.   HOW TO ORDER: It's simple: one line for all other meat (cabeza, lengua etc.). One line for adobada (at least at this location). I believe they have more lines open to order, but I've come here a few times when it was just two lines. To those griping about the format of the lines, get over it. It's understandable that you want instant gratification and to get all your tacos at once, but the food comes out quick enough. If anything it's a bit more efficient.   If you come with at least one other person (and chances are you're here with someone else) here's an idea: have one person stay in one line for a type of taco, and another person in another line waiting for the other tacos. Simple. Meet up at the register to pay for your tray. For $2 tacos and this delicious AND on the STRIP (lots of overpriced food places on the strip), it's not all that bad. You're free to try swankier places on the strip if you're that peeved.   PERFECT FOR: Drunk people! Tipsy people! People-watchers! Night owls! Broke people! You might get a heart-attack if you ate here everyday, but you cannot beat the prices and the prime location. It does get super busy, but luckily, it's got late-night hours for that after-club/after-party bite.   FOOD: The adobada tacos are deliciously marinated. It's fun watch it turn spit-style on a pineapple as it's being sliced for you. Flavorful, fattening, quick, and cheap. They don't skimp on the tacos either. Loaded with marinated meat, lettuce, tomatoes..my mouth is watering just remembering it.   Carne asada fries are disappointing, yet still tasty for me. Crackly, torn adobada instead of soft mixed with guacamole and green sauce loaded (key word: LOADED) with cheese, sour cream, and fries. Nothing too special, but very filling and good for sharing. Wished it had more guacamole and green sauce. Might be a miss for some people.   VERDICT: For the price you can't beat it. For the flavor, it's some of the best tacos in town. Overrated? Yeah. Best tacos ever? No, but it's better than Roberto's or a taco bell. This place has performed consistently for me that it's always perfectly moist, flavorful, rich meat. For others, the rush hour and lines might throw some off. Not a bad place for tourists and locals alike to try out for late night eats.",

    "text": "This location was closed for over a year and I  am so stoked that they're back. These are the BEST tacos on the strip PERIOD. They are so good, when I would visit Vegas last year I would make the journey off strip into a real seedy part of town to wait an hour in line to enjoy these tacos. And it was worth it. I'm excited to see them back on the strip and still operated by the same owners. The quality has not changed. Before this business closed down last year it had thousands of reviews and a solid 4.5/5 star rating. Not only is this the best street taco place in Vegas, this could be the best street tacos in the United States. Besides the classics: carne Asada, pastor, pollo Asada, they also offer specialty items like lengua, cabeza, tripa, sesos, chorizo, the list goes on and on. Everything is authentic and delicious. All the tortillas are made in front of you. The meat is grilled in front of you. Everything is fresh and made to order. At their price point, it will be one of the least expensive meals you can eat in Vegas and easily the most delicious.",

Therefore, some lines go a lot faster.  One item that is not listed on the menu is tacos de noples (cactus). Don't know why because they are delicious!!!   The tortillas as freshly hand made. A True heavenly experience.  Oh, they have traditional sweets for dessert.   You must come here!!",

All super full of flavor, with that good salty seasoning tast. Very rich and tender in meat. The line is usually really long for the Lengua so you know it's good. I spend a good $10.00 for 4 tacos and a drink. I call that a good steal because really I tapped out at my 3rd taco.  I want to try their fries one day, but do beware as I heard that it is very filling even for a big eater.

The line is EXTREMLY long... the way it is organized does not make sense... One line if you want asada, another for pastor and another for anything else. WTF? I do not want to have to wait in 3 different lines to get tacos. Also... I don't know what type of salsa/sauce they put on the pastor tacos or the fries but it is not good and definitely not authentic. It would be nice if they just gave them with cilantro and onion like all other places and then have a separate salsa bar. I don't see myself coming back.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo is located near the end (or beginning of the strip, depending on where you enter), right next to Encore, sort of across from Circus Circus, and nearby the Riviera Hotel/Casino. Although it's a pretty unassuming location, rest assured you are in the right place.  Although we drove here from our hotel, I was able to find parking pretty easy. Your mileage may vary of course (we arrived around 9:00 PM)  For new patrons of Tacos El Gordo, things can be a bit confusing. There are actually three (3) different lines going. Two feeding into the restaurant from the outside and one on the inside which is closer to the restroom.  The two lines outside serve:  1) Carne Asada/Chorizo 2) Adobada (marinated pork)  The line inside serves:  3) Everything else  One of the staff members does come out from time to time to remind people which line to get in - if you are here for the carne asada, it's the line all the way to the left of the restaurant (typically the longest line)  After waiting about 40 minutes, I ordered 12 Carne Asada Tacos to share with my group which came with onion and cilantro, non-spicy red sauce, and a generous helping of carne asada and guacomole. I only decided on 12 because if they were really that good and I was still hungry, I did NOT want to get back into that crazy line.  Refills are free with purchase of a soda! A definite plus for me.  Tacos El Gordo also takes credit cards, another plus!  The Carne Asada tacos were truly amazing. Featuring flame grilled steak and fresh ingredients, this is the perfect food to have anytime or right after a night of dancing and drinking. I think I ate at least 10 of these tacos.  Tacos El Gordo is definitely popular for good reason. Whenever you see long lines it's one of two things:  1) It's awesome  or  2) It's overrated  I'm happy to report that Tacos El Gordo is awesome and then some. Cheap and delicious food, free soda refills, and takes credit cards? This place is easily a winner.",

I came here around the dinner hour and it was busy but not slammed. I ordered the adobada based on the Yelp recommendations. SO SO SO SO GOOD! The meat is roasted on a spit and carved off with a huge knife. It is served on two small corn tortillas, topped with onions, cilantro and an avocado cream sauce. I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork.   So yeah, I came here twice in one day. Both times got tacos and the 2nd time got tacos and  tostada. NOT EVEN SORRY. At $2 a pop El Gordo won't break the bank and will fill you up and leave you wanting more. Just remember they are smallish so don't feel bad if you have 6. lol.

    "text": "I had been looking fwd to yry these tacos; honestly dont recall if I actually tried in TJ before or not, so I had Al pastor , asada and chorizo. Im not a big chorizo fan but this chorizo was good. Think tacos are $2.4+. To start out know what you want and get in the appropriate line.depending on crowd waiting times will vary on your choice of meat. There is always a line. I didnt want to wait so i went to the al pastor line which to start was not aware of that sytem. When got to front I was able to order the 2 other types 2max limit. I would of tried 2 of each if could of ordered more variety to taste. Off the bat ingredients taste fresh, hand made tortillas (it seemed) unless masa was for sopes or other items. The asada was good but needed a bit salt not much. In my opinion a few things that stand out is the guacamole on some tacos. Think all had except the al pastor. Al pastor had 2 tortillas the other 1. The tortilla of the al pastor had been passed on oil the others were not. The star of the tacos i tried were without a doubt the al pastor. I wish I could of tried the lengua and suadero. Saw they have tripas too. The line will mainly be for people that stick with the common meats or perhaps dont eat pork. If you want other meats should not be long wait based on what I noticed and others confirmed. The tacos do not need salsa. Definately give them a try .",

The taco truck near where I live is so much cheaper ($1 per taco) and tastes so much better than this. But overall it is not too bad, I understand why the line was so long.

It is a fast food style restaurant, so be prepared to order when reaching the counter.  There is lots of seating but since it's so full it may be hard to find a table. We took our tray outside and ate on the curb because it was so full. That didn't bother us one bit since we had a tray of heavenly tacos to eat.   Highly recommended coming here.",

    "text": "I don't get it. There shouldn't be a great chain taco place in a well-touristed location such as the Strip, but here it is.  Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive...  Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.  After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.  - Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.) - Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos. - Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.  (Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.  Anyway, back to the rundown.)  - Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably. - Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender. - Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.  Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip. I'd definitely come back here or check out their other Las Vegas location the next time that I'm thinkin' tacos (probably for cabeza, al pastor, suadero, and the lengua that I skipped out on). I'd also try the San Diego locations too if somehow I managed to check out all the other popular spots first.",

After my friends kept making a big deal about it, I decided to try it on a Monday night. Upon arriving, I was surprised at how many people were there, standing in line at 11 pm. Despite the long lines, the service was quick, prompt, and ran in a very strategic way.  My first visit there, I decided to try 2 adobada tacos with everything on them. Upon eating my first taco, I couldn't stop myself from shoving the second one in my mouth and getting back in line for more tacos. It was so tasty and flavorful! The sauces mixed so well with the juicy meat, and complemented each other perfectly. My second round I decided to try the carne asada tacos which also drove my taste buds wild. Everything tasted and actually was fresh! The meat and tortillas are made right in front of you, how can it get any better than that?   Tacos El Gordo is one of the best taco places here in Vegas. It gave me a reason to pay $2 for a taco, hopefully it amazes you too.",

    "text": "Adobado.  That's the only word you need to remember.  After a loooong night at XS,  we were too hungry to even think about sleep.  Generally, we'd hit up Earl's, Grand Lux, Ellis Island, or any other 24/7 places around the strip.  This time around, a friend from UNLV told us we gotta try this tacos place out.  There was no way I could've refused since tacos are one of my favorites and we figured... gotta trust the locals!  After a short drive, and it really is a short drive from Wynn properties, we were there and it was still packed at 5am.  Two lines, one for adobado and one for everything else.  The reason there's a line for the adobado is that the spicy pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit, just like how it would be in Mexico!  The pork is shaved directly onto fresh warm tortilla, then they add all the toppings for the tacos: lime green cream sauce, salsa, onions & cilantro.  The spicy pork has a ton of flavor and the cream sauce just works so well with the salsa and the pork.  Oh!  Also, if you look closely you'll see a chunk of pineapple at the top of the vertical spit.  You can actually request to have pina in your taco!  Definitely wouldn't have known if it wasn't for our friend and that sweet warm pineapple in the taco was definitely what makes this taco one of the best I've ever had!   We also shared some carne asada fries.  I've lived in San Diego for a few years and I have yet to find carne asada fries comparable to the ones I've had in SD.  Tacos El Gordo's fries do come close though!  Fries are covered with carne asada, shredded cheese, and the same lime green sauce with a few dollops of guac!  Heavy, yes, but very much needed after 6+ hours at XS :P  So glad my first Mexican food experience in Vegas was such a legit one.  El Gordo is now a must.  Affordable and tasty, can't get better than that!",

    "text": "11am opening time on a Sunday morning and it was already mayhem.  We were stuck in 1 line only to realize when we got to the counter that we could only order Al Pastor and Adobada in that line.  If you wanted anything else from their menu like Chorizo, lengua, quesadillas or carne asada fries, you had to line up at 1 of the 3 other lines!!!  Ridiculous!!!  It took me 20mins to get my order of 2 Al Pastor vampiros in my line and as much as I wanted to try the other stuff, I didn't wanna line up again, especially since I arrived the lines were even longer!  After you got your oders, you had to pay at the cashier, then squeeze to the beverage counters.  Dear Tacos El Gordo owners, obviously your stuff is good and people are willing to line up for it, but I really wish you would care more about customer service!  I wish you would implement an effective process where it's first come, first served, order what you want, get it then pay!  We are not herds of cows wanting to eat, we are PEOPLE folks!  Moral of the story, come at an odd hour or come prepared... in a group of 5 people - 1 to save a table, 4 to order at each line/counter so all of yous can get what you want.  Or you can check out their other outlet at E Charleston Rd which may be less crowded.    All we had was the Al Pastor vampiros and the flan.  The flan was good, but I have a personal preference of the Philippine leche flan over the Mexican version.  This version is more dense, but still yummy and creamy.  For those who haven't tried Vampiros, try it!  It's a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich.  It's all your taco fillings sandwiched between tortillas and grilled so that the cheese melts and packs all the goodness inside.  The Al Pastor meat was exceptional, one of, if not the best I've tried in Vegas.  Very tender and tasty, the right amount of sweet and spices.  The cheese was melted and yummy but the tortilla they used was so thin that most of it was pretty burnt.  I preferred the tortilla they use in Taco y Taco vampiros.  We definitely have to go back for the other items on the menu!   P.S. 4 stars for the food, 4 stars for service (helpful runners that ensure the seating area is clean), and 2 stars for the ordering process which is very annoying.",

I hyped this place up from Day 1 and we all braved the torrential downpour in Vegas and nasty morning hangover so that my friends could finally taste these infamous tacos.  Wow, I'm embarrassed now... They tasted like garbage.  The carne asada tacos were drenched in guacamole and the combination just tasted off.  Oh, and the spicy pork (adobada) tacos were just...different!    I gave the Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista 5 stars, but this place deserves 1!  One star for the nice lady who handed us a roll of paper towels to dry ourselves because we looked like someone threw a bucket of water on us.",

I thought the adobada was the most flavorful out of the three. The others, didn't really stand out. The food tastes decent (I'd give it 3-3.5 stars at most) but I just can't get over the price!

We came at 1100 on a Sunday morning, line out the door. We came a 3rd time... Guess where the line was... Yup.  This 4th time we were like dude, I hate lines and am so starving but omg this place must be amazing if it's getting this kinda business, right? Right.  I can't promise you'll love it. So I can't promise it's worth the wait of the long lines. It's definitely authentic. The cooks/preparers are very kind and efficient. Friendly. Nobody starting sh*t or acting crazy. Living in El Paso, I CAN say I've had better... However I CANNOT say I've had better in Las Vegas. Cheap, on the strip, good \"drunk food\".  Tacos (for a dude my size) are smaller so order a few. My Japanese wife, who barely clocks in at 100lbs, ate 4. It was tough of course but she still finished all 4. So you see what I mean... Big dude with big appetite? Get about 6... Not kidding. Everyone seemed to love it. Didn't see any sour faves or disappointed kids etc... I mean it is what it is. Locally it's obviously the dope biz... I guess I'm immune to it because of where I live, which is basically Ciudad Juarez lol...of course it's El Paso Texas, but you wouldn't know that from the license plates you see. But I'm cool with it, border towns got the bomb food!  Go to Tacos El Gordo... Get a few, try it out. Won't break the bank. Worth it. I say 3 stars, but Let the long lines and overall rating on yelp guide you.",

I stood in line for the carne asada and my hubby stood for the pastor. The pastor line was so fast, I waited around 40 min to get my tacos. There were about 7 ppl ahead of me, but someone ordered like 30 tacos.  but!!! When we sat and ate our tacos. Oh my word! Amazing. The pineapple with the pastor tacos- all of the tacos were packed with meat, sauce and cilantro. You pay after you get your tacos and then have a seat. Tables are limited but we got lucky. Needless to say I was happy with the visit and so was my tummy! I'll be back again.",

TIP: \"Enjoy the freebies...\" - PINEAPPLE: When you order the Adobada, ask for that side of extra pineapple - PEPPERS: Don't miss the player of Spicy Grilled Peppers and Green Onions. - RADISHES: Go to the condiment table and grab a baggie of sliced radishes along with some of that fresh squeezed lime juice on them.

You would think with so many people it would be worth the wait. In my opinion it's not even worth getting in line.  The way it's set up is already frustrating. If you want Adobada (spicy pork) you have to get in 1 of 4 lines and then if you want to get carne asada you have to get back in line again! It's set up like this so you can watch them grill the beef and cut the pork off the spit. It makes it seem more eye catching because it sold me for a good minute.  After I waited in line to get into another line and then move to a 3rd line I waited in the final line to pay. And what I got after all that time was some soggy tortillas, unseasoned carne asada, and spicy pork that wasn't even a bit spicy. The asada was cooked well but that's about it.   I live in LA and I can get good Mexican food on pretty much every street corner. I know a good taco when I see one and these were mediocre at best. Not worth the wait, but if you want to try for yourself than don't go alone. Bring at least 1 more person to get in the lines with you.",

If you go by yourself, you might be s.o.l. My favorites are the Adovada (marinated spit roasted pork) and their carne asada. Both are excellent representations of how it should be. The Adovada is impressive with not one, but two massive \"trompos\", the vertically stack slices of marinated pork rotating in front of a fire, with the constant manicuring, slicing thin, juicy slices into freshly made corn tortillas, is worth the wait. Be sure to get them \"con todo\" (with everything) so that you don't miss out on the full experience. The carne asada is char-broiled over a lava rock broiler, creating that delicious \"al Carbon\" flavor that caps off the perfect carne asada experience. Go in a group and have one member stand in line at one window to get Adovada, then have another member get the carne asada, and then another to get the suadero or lengua and you can all meet at the cashier before the tacos get cold.",

The carne asada taco was one of my favorites. Lots of flavor and the guacamole was a plus. The al pastor was slightly spicy. Not horrible, but my dad said he would start sweating if he ate more than one (he can't handle spice whatsoever without sweating a ton).   The carne asada fries were good, but id rather just order more tacos. :) Go to Tacos El Gordo!",

    "text": "Believe the hype, y'all! Tacos El Gordo is as good as it gets!  Surprisingly, I found this location to be a lot less overwhelming than the Charleston location which is odd seeing as to how it's on the Strip. The layout here is definitely a bit more efficient and the lines moved at a decent pace.   If it's your first time at Tacos El Gordo, do yourself a favor and plan ahead. No, seriously. There are three separate lines for the different types of meats offered. It's best to have an idea of what you're planning to order beforehand. I would suggest that your party split up and have each person stand in separate lines. Use the buddy system, folks! The most popular meat served is the Adobada Al Pastor (my favorite) and this line in particular tends to be longer than the others. It's completely worth the wait!  The Al Pastor is so good! The meat is flavorful and juicy. It's freshly sliced into two corn tortillas as you order your tacos. I love the crispiness around the edges of the tortillas after they're fried on the grill for a few seconds. The tacos are completed with the works- Cilantro, onions, and salsas! Try it with pineapple too!  Prices are fair, location is clean, and the staff is courteous. The employees behind the counter always impress me with the way they work under pressure!  Grab your tacos and get some Orange Bang to wash it all down!",

I do not advise you coming here after a show where you dressed up real nice and in uncomfortable shoes.   Located in a strip mall at the north end of the Strip, you'll be wondering why people would stand in line for a taco joint? Being from Texas, I've had my fair share of street tacos, so it could it be that good? After about a 30-45min wait we finally got to the ordering stand, there are a few lines however, and you have to choose a particular line for a particular food and hunt down a table.  We ordered the large carne asada fries. While the portion was huge, I thought it was just ok. Taste waste I felt it could've used a little bit more kick, maybe a spicy taste to it. It satisfied a light night hunger pain, but would I wait in that massive line again for it? Maybe not.",

    "text": "YUMMY tacos with fresh made tortillas. I always try to stop by tacos el gordo every time I'm in Vegas. The price is decent, and everything is made fresh.. including the tortillas!  Downside and what I wish they would fix, is the wait!  They had a security guard stand at the door to control the amount of customers to go inside because the line was long.. basically, there are different lines for different type of meats you are going to order. The al pastor line seemed the quickest because the guard kept letting people who wanted that meat inside first. Whereas the carne asada and chorizo line was the longest and barely moved. But as I got to the front of the line, I realized that the customers that said they were getting the al pastor meat and were let in first were actually jumping lines once inside, therefore making the other line longer.  Another downside to this is, because there are different lines for different meats, the tacos for quicker line will get cold while you (even if you split up with your buddies and wait in different lines) wait for the other tacos.. Would i go back for the tacos.. yeah..  do I want them to fix the line system.. heck yeah! *tip: ask for foil to cover the tacos you've ordered..they will look messier when you eat them, but will maintain some heat while you wait for the tacos in the slower longer line.",

As we slowly inch our way into the restaurant we come into many lines.  the security guard ends up telling me and my boyfriend which line to go into. They section off the lines in different meats you are going to order. My first impression of the place is that it is extremely packed also the prices are pricey.   For regular tacos it's like $2.50. Personally to me that's pretty expensive I'm used to cheap cheap tacos like $.50 tacos. And then we got the Carne Asada fries and and that was $13. Another thing is that it took a while to find seating. everybody was like hawks trying to get a Seat for themselves.   As we tried the food my boyfriend said that the tacos were good. The carne fries weren't too bad either but it hurt my soul every time I was taking a bite because they were so expensive. I guess what can I expect right? It is Vegas after all. So we left full and appeased.   Other side notes : there were two security guards in the restaurant watching over everybody, there was a lady mopping the floor's while everybody was walking around",

At that time, I was not a big tacos fan like now, but I remembered I really enjoyed the lengua tacos and the adobada (spicy pork) tacos. Ever since then, I always reserved some time to go to El Gordo every time I visited San Diego.  I discovered that El Gordo has 2 locations in Vegas just recently. In Vegas, I found a new love for the carne asada fries. They give you a whole bunch of asada (steak) on top of a bed of fried smothered with their heavenly white and green sauce. BOMB!!!  The line can get really long, I once came on a Saturday night and we waited in line for around 40 mins. Side note, once you're inside you have to line up based on the meat you want to get. So split up your crew so the ordering will be faster.  One more tip, do not, I repeat, do not take the tacos home. You have to eat them right away because everything is made fresh, even the tortillas so they will get soggy once you take them home. So, wait in line, order your heart out, pay, and devour immediately.",

Also ordered a couple lengua and tripas tacos. The taco guy was rushing and did not get my complete order. Once I let him know he lectured me for the next 2 minutes about giving him the complete order the first time (which I DID!) and ordering other types of tacos at the other lines. I agree with the other comments about the layout being horrible. So after being lectured, waited and waited and finally found a table to sit at and eat. AND then, found a long gray hair in my taco. Just great!!! GRRR. Needless to say, I was disgusted after that. Finished my other tacos. A MINUTE had gone by when one of the employees that cleans tables asked if we were done eating because there was other people waiting for a table. NOT A MINUTE had passed since I finished chewing for God's sake!!!!! Who does that???!!! Believe me, I knew people were waiting for a table and no I did plan on sitting there for hours! Just simply bad experience!",

I like tripes that come with the Vietnamese beef noodle soup (Pho) and dim sum but just not here because of the organ taste.  Orange bang and pina cola whipped drinks are good.  Try them.",

It is lacking tables or areas to enjoy your tacos.  So you stand in specific lines and those lines only serve those items otherwise you have to stand in line again.  The organization of it all doesn't allow you to get a variety of tacos.  Different if you are not used to it.  We settled for carne asada tacos and wanted to get the spicy pork but again didn't want to begin all over again.  When we got outside there were people whose family members were still in line who had grabbed any table and just waited.  Meanwhile we were looking to find a ledge, a chair, and finally settled for a curb near the restaurant.  There were cockaroaches near the curb that we were sitting at and well, again...no tables which lowered my rating for the restaurant.  Otherwise the food is very good.  Authentic Mexican food.",

    "text": "I'm from Los Angeles so I know a decent taco when I see one. This place was recommended to me so I took their advice and came by to see for myself. It was super packed and the lines were separated by the choice of meat you want(weird). I wanted asada but the line was long for that one. I waited for half hour and ordered 8 tacos and one Azteca taco because I like Nopales(cactus).  4 stars for the Azteca taco, it was semi decent, I wish I had ordered more of those instead of the asada. The asada is not marinated in anything but salt and pepper. I guess they want the charbroiled typical asada flavor you get in Tijuana and want the meat to stand out like this. If you're okay with that I guess it's okay, I personally would have liked the meat to have some sort of marinade, no I'm not picky but giving my honest opinion. Sorry but tacos have no flavor. I wasn't a fan of the avocado topping, it should be optional to have it on your taco, here all tacos come with avocado, I didn't know that. I like mine straight up just the meat, cilantro, salsa and onions with the option of adding guacamole and extra hot salsa. I guess I got spoiled from growing up with King Taco and having amazing tacos from just about every taco place in LA so these to me were average, nothing to write home about. The price per taco was okay, 2.25 each. Taste was a 3 star. Cured my tcraving but for the long line and wait, not somewhere I would go out of my way for next time I'm in town. By the way, I hope the cooks working in high heat get paid well, they work really really hard. Make sure and leave them a nice tip because they do deserve it. I was very impressed with that. For them I give 5 stars.",

The salsa had no flavor and there was nothing extraordinary about the carne asada.  The top it off, their system is completely backwards. What's the point of standing in line to order food and THEN standing in another line to pay? The food is already cold by the time you actually get to eat it. The tortilla on the quesadilla that I got was so hard, it felt like I was eating a tostada. Maybe I could have been okay with the crunchy tortilla except that the tortillas also tasted bad, so much that my friends didn't even finish their tacos.  The only thing about this place that is worth the 1 star is the fountain drink selection because it had \"agua fresca\" flavors.",

They ran out of cilantro and guacamole. How does a taco spot run out of cilantro! It ain't a taco if you don't have onion and cilantro. The onion pieces were as big as the meat! The salsa was the worst! It had no flavor and tasted like a chip salsa dip. We waited about an hour to get these nasty tacos. Yes, the tortillas are hand made but they are hard and cold. They put in this tube where they get soggy! They didn't have proper taco condiments but they sure did charge full price! The organization there is the worse! It sucks that if you want different meats you need to get in each line. Once your done with those lines; you need to get in another line to pay. Wow...cold tacos for the family. Go from one spot to another with all the food and people breathing all over your food. Not to mention, you do all this and still take an additional 15 mins or longer to get a table to sit! Then you have the employee moping and blowing air with wet sign. Why clean it if the place still looks filthy dirty! My 7 yr old daughter rated this spot the worst ever! Customer service is not good either. No carisma! Never again!!!",

So what's the disconnect between Tijuana and California? Why can't I get that same taste? Even in Latino communities, the taste is not replicated. By normal taco joint standards, meat is pre-prepped and loaded into a silver tin.  Then I discovered Tacos El Gordo. They are the real deal. The authentic Tijuana street taco. Everything is made fresh right before your eyes. Pat-pat (tortilla), chop-chop (meat), spoon-spoon (guac & salsa), and splash of both onion and cilantro. The guac is silky smooth. A perfect texture for this type of taco. Chunky would ruin it. Most places don't even offer guac on street tacos.  Beware...there are many pop-up Taco's El Gordo restaurants in the US, but only a few are the \"REAL\" Tacos El Gordo. Chula Vista, San Diego, and a few in Vegas. Thank the lord!!! Praise Jesus (Hey-Soos).  I'm hooked for life!!!!",

Luckily for me, it was walking distance from our hotel so we moseyed on over. And doubling our luck, it wasn't even crowded (maybe we should have hit the card tables with all this good fortune, but I digress). What's weird is that there are different windows for the different types of tacos. The guy at our (pastor) window was super nice and grabbed us some asada tacos from the guy next to him. But I can't imagine standing in line multiple times for multiple tacos. The pastor tacos were deeeeeelicious, topped with a verde salsa and pineapple. The asada tacos on the other hand, were just meh in my opinion... not a lot of flavor and topped off with a huge dollop of guacamole... and this is coming from a someone who is obsessed with anything avocado. In this case, it just didn't work because it was just as bland as the rest of the taco and made a huge mess. Overall, I would come back for the pastor tacos for sure.",

Went in on a Monday morning at about 11:30am and surprisingly there were no big lines! I ordered the asada, chorizo and al pastor and hands down the Al pastor were the best.  Staff was very nice and the food was great! Will definitely come back again on my next visit.",

    "text": "Don't come here expecting some \"above average customer service\" because it's a super cheap option on the Vegas strip! Tacos are about $2.25 each and they're as authentic as it gets. Free parking (private lot), it's walking distance to and from Encore. Do yourself a favor and look at the pictures on Yelp (including the menu) and decide what you want ahead of time, and know which line to go into because:  A) they don't slow down for anyone  B) they can't hear you most of the time because it's loud in there (behind the counter AND in the seating area)  C) It goes fast, even if the lines are out the door.  The only thing is the line - which will likely determine if it's worth it to go. If the line is SUPER LONG, out the door, and it's hella hot outside, I'm going to skip it just because they have limited indoor seating (and hell to the no I'm not sitting outside to eat). Just saying!",

If you don't eat: make an exception for Tacos El Gordo.   I've been to 4 different Gordos el taco stops now (2 in SD, 2 in Vegas). Honestly, they all taste the same to me. What never changes is the length of the line, because it's always going to feel too long especially when you've been saving your appetite just for this moment.   This one is closest to the strip, so it's probably longer than the one in downtown LV. If you have means of transportation, I'd recommend going to the one downtown which may have a tad shorter of a line.",

It's like having a big, nvm let's not go there ;p   Easy to find taco shop due to the giant line out the door any time of day, but know what you want before you reach the door! Once you get inside the line gets divided into diff stations of meat. If you want diff types of tacos, you may have to stand and wait in multiple lines. It's best to go with friends and have each get tacos from diff lines, then share :D   Once you receive your tacos, don't forget go to the cashier to pay before grabbing a seat. They use the honor system here so don't steal!",

The flavors were unique, the staff were authentic, and the juices were amazing. The carne asada fries, or any fries, were gigantic and they do not skimp out on any ingredients.  The tacos, while definitely tasty, are small.  My brother, who doesn't eat too much, ordered 4 and even then I question his satiety.  They hand make the corn tortillas in front of you, carve the meat from huge skewers for each taco, and you can customize it however you like.  They offer unique ingredients like shoulder and others.  A side dish of grilled peppers and onions are provided for every order as well.  I only wish they offered salsas because I absolutely love salsas.  Definitely an excellent stop for a Vegas trip, especially if you're tired of buffets and McDonald's.  The quality for the price is unbeatable.",

I would definitely recommend the Adobada tacos with everything on them, but its hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.  Some downsides are that El Gordos always seems busy and it is probably not the most efficient ordering experience if you want multiple kinds of tacos given that there are separate lines depending on what you are ordering. If you are going as a couple or as a group I would suggest coordinating your order and splitting up amongst the lines.   Even with the downsides the tacos are always worth it though. Just a fantastic, genuine, taco shop with no frills. Tacos El Gordo is a must eat for me whenever I'm in Vegas. Perfect for lunch or post Vegas shenanigans late night eats.",

First of all we tried a taco of every meat on their menu and all of them were REALLY  DELICIOUS!!! I would of gave them five stars but the only reason I decided to give them four was because the place was full of customers and I understand maybe because it was a holiday , but the place was packed and they have three different lanes for you to order your tacos depending on the meat you want, so we started  at the line to order carne asada and after we received the tacos then we had to go stand at the line to order lengua, so by the time I got those tacos, my other tacos were already cold and there was only ONE guy serving them and poor guy he was trying his best to be fast and keep the line moving. Another thing is that they need more tables and chairs they only had maybe 10 small tables inside so we had to eat our tacos outside in our car because they don't have tables outside either. Like I said before, the tacos are great and maybe next time I come back it's not a holiday and the service would be faster.",

To me a quesadilla is a big tortilla with meat and cheese, folded in half. For that, I deducted a star. Customer service was great and so were the prices Only thing I disliked was the lack of available seats. It was so crowded, we had to eat old school style.

There were so many people at this taco shop which I knew meant they were going to be amazing. So amazing that people were becoming confrontational when people broke in line. Should be some order and organization there. You run up to a vacant countertop space and scream your order to the staff behind a sneeze guard in the kitchen. Then once you retrieve your food, you run over to get in line for the cashier. And this line intersects with the crowd who is pushing and shoving to place their food orders. Anyways, great food, just be prepared.",

You could not find parking at some point, but there are always people coming in and out of the restaurant pretty quick. Always ask for pineapple on your tacos!-even when they are low on one side, they would always grab me some from another line. Also, their nopales (sauteed cactus) are BOMB!

You walk in and line up kinda cafeteria style, based on what kind of taco you would like (it was unclear to us where to order anything but tacos). To get my asada (steak) tacos was right near the door and easy. I then went to order tacos sesos ( I believe this is what it was called) and after watching them cut up beef tongues for other orders, they served me beef brain!! The man behind me translated and helped me to find something I would enjoy. Don't get me wrong: many people really enjoy the beef tongue and brain - it is just not for me and tainted my appetite.   After you order and get your tacos you go to a cash register to pay and get drinks (fountain, bottle, or can). If you are lucky to get a seat without waiting for others to finish, you can eat there.   My friend had pork and asada tacos and enjoyed them, but the tacos did leave us hungry pretty soon after.  The service was very kind, though.  I won't be returning, but if you are interested in some authentic, unique Mexican faire. Give this place a try!",

    "text": "My parents coming from Mexico I grew up eating tacos and let me tell you. These are not very good. They do come from Baja California and are popular in Tijuana, however it always depends how they're cooked. Meat is sometimes burnt, dry, and doesn't have flavor. Not mentioning the cost of more than $2 PER taco. For less than $5 you could get a whole meal at Pepe's Tacos in downtown. Just need to drive. My second time eating here, I got food poisoning from eating the Tacos Al Pastor. Don't recommend",

We got there not too late in the night and there was a decent line we waited and no moving after 15 mins a lady comes out to let people wanting certain meats in. Once we got in after about 10 more mins of waiting outside we got in. I got 3 adobada tacos pretty quick yet my husband and remainder of patty waited in line without moving. They have about 5 lines for different meats yet none besides my adobada line were moving. I don't mind waiting in line but wow they are so disorganized here! People just crowded couldn't even tell where the line was. No employee directing the crowd. And you have to order and then go wait in line at the register to pay. Mike really? The 3 adobada tacos were cold by the time I paid and got out of there. We ended up leaving without buying anything else because it was just such a mess. And the 3 tacos were def not worth the wait. Go elsewhere!",

Upon entering, you grab a red tray and follow the signs to what kind of tacos you want to try. I got the lengua (beef tongue), carne asada, and al pastor--this is probably the same order in which I liked the tacos (from most to least). Each taco is about $2 so you can get by with a cheap Vegas meal. Love the fact that you see the meat being cooked right in front of your eyes. The tortillas are super tasty and you can tell they are made with care.  Yep, it's not quite upscale dining if you're into that for a Vegas experience but you came for the food right?",

Decide whether to add sour cream, avocado, cheese ... then go to another line to the cashier, to order drink, then pay.  All of this in a mad crazy crowd of people!  Of course I am talking about at night time crowd, after hours, when thousands of people are looking to grab a bite after night clubbing ...  I don't particularly like the pork tacos. The meat has kind of sweet taste from the pineapple. Therefore, I choose the beef steak tacos.  I really prefer the flour tortillas, but they only serve corn tortillas.  Usually I order 3 tacos. Almost always wanted to order more after eating them, but I don't have the patience to wait in line again! After all the tacos are fulfilling. Kinda addicting. It's almost a habit to eat here on the weekend nights! Definitely love them!",

The only thing that lacked was the salsa, it was not spicy enough. But then again I love my salsa super HOT! But that's ok... It was still pretty damn good! I know when we come back to Vegas during Thanksgiving week we will be hitting this place a few times during our stay.   I really loved their Vampiros! The tostada was nice and toasty and the meat and fried cheese on it was on point too.   Highly recommend this place if u don't live in the San Diego area... These tacos are True to the Tijuana style tacos, BEST!!! And going to their website it says they started in Tijuana before heading to San Diego and Las Vegas. So there u go! Authentic! Tijuana has the best tacos hands down! And they live up to their roots!   See you soon Gordo!!! We got nothing but love for you baby! muah!",

I know I will stay awake after eating here  I have been to the other Tacos El Gordo and we decided to try this one out since it is fairly closer to home.  The place is busy since it is on the strip.    I actually took some time to look at the menu this time and noticed some interesting tacos such as beef tongue and beef brain.  I didn't think they would be appealing to me so I stuck with my usual; carne asada fries.  Full Size please..  Order first, pay after.  Seat yourself.  Also do remember to ask for hot sauce and mild sauce.  The other place I went to offered, but she could have just forgotten.  My carne asada fries looked wonderful as it usually does, layered with cheeses and two scoops of guacamole.  Obviously delicious since I ate it all.  Tender meat and skinny fries.  Not salted.. Fries a little crisp..   Now, I did reach over and picked a piece of brain from my friend's taco.. That was very interesting.. mushy and no flavor.. I was definitely better off with fries.  I guess you have to acquire a taste or demand for it.  But the tacos looked excellent from my view of the booth.    Great late night place, little condiment bar with lemons, slice beets, etc.  Self serve drinks.  Little tables.  Fresh Mexican food smell.   Would I come back, Yes! But next round will be at the other location.. I want to compare and contrast.",

Ordering was a bit confusing though because you order different things from different \"stations.\" The grilled stuff, like carne asada, you should order on the far left and the adobada line is where the giant pork leg is being shaved off, and anything else is on the other side adjacent to it. I was very lost the first time I went there.   I got lengua, carne asada and pork adobada tacos for $2 each. They include (or you can ask for) the grilled green onions and chili's, which are freakin' awesome! The service was fast and very friendly. They help out those who are obviously having a hard time ordering (like moi). I know they have other stuff on the menu aside from tacos, but I don't pay much attention since their tacos are the main attraction. I guess I'll try their carne asada fries next time.  This place is open late, until 5am on Fri & Sat. That's why after clubbing, my friends and I go straight to this place and get our late night (early morning?) grub on.",

The best part is its open really late on the weekends so when I leave the club around 4am I can get my fix of some of the BEST PASTOR TACOS (Adobada) I've had in Vegas. They have several different lines depending on the type of filling you want: Asada, Adobada, and then Lengua,Tripas, etc. and everything is prepared fresh in front of you customized however you like. You can even order off the menu like Nopales (cactus) which is also very good. They even provide you grilled peppers and green onions that you can munch while you wait.   I would imaging being drunk as hell would just amplifiy the already super delicious eats here cause I always see a couple people I ended up having to kick out of the club there! Its really busy and loud at 4am and it always makes for a great atmosphere! They have security there too so even if you're scurred don't hesitate to come and get some great food!",

(Just sprinkle in some lime juice & hot sauce... tastes best mixed in with their green sauce). They use fresh potatoes for their carne asada fries and their meat is so tender & smoky....

It's so ironic that American Mexican food is called Tex-Mex, yet it wasn't great. Moved here in 2013, and my friend brought me to Don Tortaco. I was drunk but that is the most horrible Tex-Mex food I've had. Heard about Tacos el Gordo has one here in Vegas. Went here one drunken night, and I was so happy. This is the kind of Mexican food that I like.   The small tacos are good, but what sold me is the carne asada fries. So yummy! I hate to admit that it's now on the same level as carne asada fries in Sarita's in San Diego. They're a bit different than carne asada fries in SD, but it's nonetheless delicious! I would go back here again just for the CARNE ASADA FRIES.  My boyfriend decided to try the TACO DE CABEZA (beef head). It was good. Better than Taco de Asada. Get that one!",

Mouth watering, juicy, salty, delicious, wow! Don't forget to ask for pineapples on your tacos! They don't add it Unless you ask for it. Ask for extra sauce too! The saucy-er, the better. ;)   The line was really long, almost to the door. But it went by pretty fast because there were a lot of stations and workers. It's definitely worth the wait and the hype. It gets confusing and people cut you in line, so make sure to stand correctly and know what you're doing!   All in all, five stars! This place is a must go.

    "text": "I love this place! This is my second time in Vegas and my first food stop had to be this joint. Yummy taco asadora (spicy pork). I love how they dip their freshly made corn tortilla in the meat juices before making the taco; added so much flavour! The free grilled onion and jalapeno peppers we got was awesome. Don't let the first bite of the peppers deceive you, they get hotter and hotter. Love love the tacos de lengua (beef tongue). The meat was so soft and succulent. My friend didn't even realize that it was tongue she kept on stuffing into her mouth. She may be used to that;)",

They only one that was good, in my opinion, was the al pastor (or adobada). The rest of the tacos were dry and salsaless....but the pastor tacos were juicy ans great! Its like they put less salsa on the tacos so people would buy a side of salsa in little containers by the cashier. I personally wont return unless i'm craving some al pastor tacos.",

The sauce is refreshing and a nice complement, but overall everything was just.... meh. I'm glad I only had to wait 5 minutes or so in line.",

They have a very straightforward ordering process where multiple lines serve different types of meat (but you can order all kinds of tacos from any line). In order of increasing flavor, I would recommend the lengua, carne asada, and adobada, which is pork cooked on the spit roast. Don't forget to ask for some grilled leeks and peppers, which come free of charge and are a great complement to the tacos.",

    "text": "So, this trip to Las Vegas was essentially a post-deployment treat - one that I went on by myself as to get the freedom to do whatever the heck I wanted - including playing 20 straight hours of poker at the Wynn, which is the reason I found Tacos El Gordo - which I believe means Fat Tacos.  2 a.m., I drunk, walking down the street - just about the only tacos I was going to get to eat at that time was a real one - and I wasn't going to complain.  Stepping into Tacos El Gordo is to be transformed from Las Vegas to Tijuana - in fact, the owner says they are formerly from Tijuana, which I often visited as a kid. Dirty, scuzzy, and authentic - that's about the only things I can use to describe this place.   Although there are about eight different types of tacos - each costing about $2.50, I opted for the stomach and tongue tacos - both culinary delights I'd learned to eat having grown up in Southern California.  In my best Spanish, which I failed both in college and high school, I ordered two of each, and an Horchata (a milky, cinnamon drink). The guy behind the counter looked at me with amusement, and in lightning speed, whipped up two of each. After paying for it all and putting a few bucks in the tip jar, I went to my seat only to be summoned back and given an extra side of meat.   \"Shoulders,\" he said. \"Try it.\"  I tried it and instantly fell in love (the next day I came back and ordered more) - it was not only flavorful and full of spices, one could almost taste the nutty, meaty taste of the cow cheeks. I was in taco heaven.  Onto the tongue and stomach, however: stomach tastes exactly the way you'd expect it to - a bit slimy, but flavorful with a hint of bitterness. No worries - a bit of lime and salt takes away the flavor that you might not be used to. I quickly wolfed it down and then tried the tongue.  Subtly beefy - that's the only way I can describe it. Tender, moist, and full of flavors, it also packed a beefy flavor that no way in hell Taco Bell could deliver - new 100 percent meat be damned. It's also a light meat - that is, it's beef, but doesn't come with the heaviness that beef often is known for. It is, in a sense, as soft and gentle as a baby's sigh - heavenly goodness.  I washed it all down with the drink I mentioned - the sweetness cleaning my palate with each swallow, allowing me to go back to the tacos and tasting everything packed in it each time.  The next day, I went back for more. In fact, during my eight-day stay, I ate at Tacos El Gordo five times - each time leaving me satisfied, but also longing for more.  If you do go there, I recommend the tongue and the shoulder tacos. I also recommend the Horchata. What's more - get the little vegetables that are left to be eaten over a bed of ice. They are meant to cleanse your palate. Take a bite of it after each bite of the tacos (or if you're like me you shove the entire taco in your mouth), and I promise you'll be ranting and raving about this place, too.  Another note: do leave a tip. These people work really hard, and they do a good job serving. You're in Vegas - you're going to splurge anyway. Might as well make someone's day.",

It's basically a pile of fries, topped with your choice of meat, guacomole, sour cream, some kind of mayo based sauce and unmelted shredded cheese. It's great if you're trying to consume 2000 calories in 1 meal.... I didn't really like them to be honest. They should melt the cheese.   Nothing about this place stands out, I seriously think the Mexican food in LV is lacking... and this place is no different.",

You will easily spend an hour and a half in line.  So for that reason, this place fails.  Probably won't be coming back unless its at an unusual hour to avoid the lines. So the verdict?  Great tacos, but not good enough to spend hours standing in line.",

These are truly the most authentic Mexican Tacos I have had in Las Vegas and nothing else compares to them.  I have taken at least 5 people to go eat Tacos with me and ALL 5 LOVE this place as well.   There are 2 locations, and I will drive across town just for these tacos.  The employees are also very friendly, I went so many times that the employees started to recognize me among the hundreds of people that go eat tacos!

    "text": "\" the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos are bomb here!\" \" those are the best tacos I've had\" please......  All I could hear from my friends is them talk about this place n San Diego.  How good the tacos are and what not.  They found a Las Vegas location and insisted we go when we got there on our Vegas trip this past weekend.  Arriving at the restaurant, the employees wanted us to make two lines ( for the beef and the pork meat ).  My gf said lets split up in the lines so we could get our orders.  We decided to order:  1 taco of shoulder meat 1 taco of stomach meat 1 taco of carne asada 1 taco of adobada meat 1 order of adobada fries  The employees gave me a bit of an attitude until they forced me to speak Spanish.  They gave me my orders and went to the GF to check on the fries.  She was still waiting for the order and said they were taking a bit long.  I talked to the cook there and he was like she didn't order anything and putting her down.  I switched back to Spanish mode and told him to make the order ( with an attitude ). If that wasn't enough, the cashier girls were giving my gf attitude when she was paying because they couldn't understand that she was paying for the fries and I was paying for the tacos.  Back to Spanish mode, put them down, explained to them in a way you explain a 5 year old how to do things because obviously these people came from Tijuana yesterday and think they can give customers attitude when they themselves can't understand English in the US.  Really pissed me off that these immigrants like to talk smack in Spanish when you don't speak Spanish.  Going back to the food, I had my eyes set on the carne asada tacos and adobada ( since everyone is ranting about them). I couldn't be more disappointed in the flavor of the meat.  The asada taco's meat was tender, but really bland.  I guess cause its so bland, they smacked so much guacamole on the taco to make up for the flavor ( which made it worst).  The adobada taco meat was really dry and no flavor either!  What was the hype about??  Surprisingly when we were tasting the stomach and shoulder tacos, we were like OK that's pretty good.  The shoulder taco was kinda like carnitas style with some of the broth it was cooked in.  The stomach taco was not all chewy and nasty texture.  Had some of the broth that it was cooked in as well.  These two tacos were the best ones out of the others, how ironic ha ha.  I think the brain, stomach, head and shoulder meat is all cooked in the same broth.  The fries were pretty good too.  They were thin, crispy fries smothered in some salsa they make there.  Personally me, that salsa was OK but too much on it.  Again, the adobada meat did not help the fries.  You might want to eat the fries as soon as you can or else they will become soggy from the overload of salsa they put in.  This place really did not live up to the hype.  Rude employees, flavorless meat and expensive tacos.  I would have given this place a 1 star, but the shoulder and stomach tacos managed to change my mind.  I would like to try the head tacos,brain tacos, tostadas and quesadillas next time, but I feel like it wont be for awhile since it would have to be because friends wanna go and has to be the San Diego location.  If the San Diego location is just as bad with the immigrant workers and attitudes they give, I will gladly say I'm done with this restaurant. Never again....",

Between my sister and I, we ordered:  3 lengua tacos 3 spicy pork tacos 1 campachana fries 2 coke zeros--you know, cuz we're trying to watch our figures.  I loves me some pork so of course I ordered the adobado (sp) tacos for myself. I thought they were really good, however I don't think they are as good as the al pastor from Tacos Mexico. The ones there come very greasy and seemed to be slow cooked amongst ingredients such as onions that you can clearly see on the taco (aside from the toppings). I love the greasy, juiciness of that type of marinated pork. It seems I've only been able to find them at Tacos Mexico.  Anyhow, my sister and I swapped a taco and that lengua taco on MY lengua blew my mind! So tender and juicy! I already thought I discovered the best lengua tacos in town (Super B Burrito) over by Eastern and St Rose so I didn't have high expectations. God, I love it when I'm proven wrong in that sense.  The campachana fries were delish with half of it topped with carne asada and the other with the spicy pork. All in all, great food especially after sitting under the sun getting drunk. The restaurant was very clean, as well as the bathroom. I can't wait for my next excuse to be on the strip so we can stop by again.",

    "text": "I was staying around the corner from Tacos El Gordo in Las Vegas and it was late and I was hungry.  I started walking down the street looking for something, I didn't want fast food, I didn't wan t a fancy restaurant and I didn't want a chain place.  All of a sudden I saw Tacos El Gordo!  Front the outside It looked like the place all the locals would go, and then on the inside I was the only non Spanish person there! I felt out of place for about 30 seconds but quickly got over it.  The menu on the wall isn't very descriptive and it's a little challenging to figure out what to order where, but with the use of my IPhone looking words up I quickly figured out what I wanted, I took another 2 minutes and stepped back and then I figured out what to order where.  I think I ordered 2 Taco De Asada which are 2 steak tacos with a red sauce and guacamole and onion and then I also ordered 2 Adobada Tacos which are spicy pork!  They were all delicious.  After you get your food you walk across the restaurant to pay,  this is where I have a small issue.  There was a little display with some desserts and I have a sweet tooth, I started asking the lady at the register what each item was and she basically told me she wasn't helping me, if I didn't know what it was then tuff.  WOW, kinda rude, and I can only assume because I'm not Spanish.  I paid and left.  I gave it three stars because of the rude lady at the checkout and the little bit of confusion I had ordering and the fact the menus wasn't very descriptive of what certain items were.",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego and it was very good, although a little disorganized.  You stand in line for the type of tacos that you want and then pay at the cashier after you get them. My favorite are the tacos Adobada (Baja style spicy pork tacos with salsa, cream guacamole, onions and cilantro).  The Vegas location was a nightmare; After waiting in line for 15 minutes, it became apparent that they were not going to serve any more tacos because their equipment malfunctioned. They did not close the line or notify us, they just let everyone stand there until we figured it out on our own.  I went to the other side where there was another adoba line, and waited for 15 more minutes. One guy was ordering like 30 tacos, and then other people kept coming up to the people ahead of me and asking them to get them some more tacos so the line seem to get longer as I waited.  When I was about third back, the taco maker said something in Spanish to the person ahead of me who said \"there are no more tacos you have to get in another line\".  I didn't want to get in another line after waiting in wto fruitlessly, so I walked up to the front and talked to one of the girls making tortillas. She said something to the guy in the Adobada area who then made me three tacos, which he had enough meat for after all.  I then got in line to pay and get a drink. There were two cashiers but they were not very efficient so this took a long time as well. Finally, I got my cup and got to go get a drink. Well, they were out of ice and co2 as well because the drink was flat and warm.  I sat down and ate the tacos, which were pretty good (although not as good as the ones in San Diego). Overall this took an hour and a half of my life, not including the time it took to find a parking place on such a busy street. The quality of the food is the only reason I gave them any stars at all.   I hope they train their staff better so they can get at least as organized as the other location, and learn to communicate with their customers when they have a problem like running out of food or CO2.",

    "text": "Located in a sketchy place a little north of the Wynn, these authentic tacos are satisfying whether it's lunch, dinner, or after the club at 4am. We came on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was literally packed with Spanish speakers so that's always a very promising sign. Due to the crowds, it can be confusing as to how to place your order. But there are different lines for each type of meat. (Adobada- spicy pork was in a line by itself all the way on the left). Have a friend stand in each line and order in bunches.  As a group, we got carne asada fries, adobada, chorizo, and asada tacos. I think the asada was just ok on the tacos and the fries, and next time definitely get the adobada tacos. The spicy pork has so much flavor and the right amount of heat and watching them slice off each piece gave the reassurance of its quality. Chorizo also had a ton of flavor. I would definitely place Chorizo and Adobada above Asada.  Also, they had this fountain drink that was some whipped Orange Cream soda that was delicious. Nuff said, tacos don't get any better than this.",

    "text": "After spending a small fortune for our room, we looked forward to having a less expensive dinner. Came on a Friday night and all 5 of the lines were coming our of the doors. We left. I didn't want tacos THAT badly. We hit up the Indian kabob place a few doors down instead, but I was determined to come back and try these tacos. Saturday around noon we returned, and while the lines were sill long, they weren't as bad as they were the night before.   TIP: There are five lines total, the first one is Adobada and Al Pastor (for non Latin people, these are pork options). The second line is for Asada (marinated chopped beef), Mulas, Sopes, and Chorizo (sausage). The next two lines are duplicates of the first two lines. The fifth line is along the side and serves the more exotic meats, Cabeza, Lengua, Sesos (it doesn't specify on the menu, but this is brain, and yes, it can be delicious if made correctly), Buche, Tripa (this is the small intestine), and Suadero (thinly cut beef belly or leg meat). I believe the Vampiro (made with tortillas that are grilled to the point of being dried out) can be ordered in any of the lines, but make sure you order in the correct meat line.  Even for lunch, it was still too crowded to eat there, so we took our tacos to go and ate them in the car... but, OH MY GAWD... these tacos were GOOD! The freshly made tortillas are what I think really make these tacos so delicious. Combined with the flavorful meat (a recent reviewer wrote they were full of fat, I don't know what he experienced, because ours were GREAT - not one fatty or gristle bite), salsa that isn't too spicy, and perfectly made guacamole they add on top, these are hard to beat, taste wise! We ordered all asada tacos for the Mister and me because were were not going to stand in TWO long lines! Because of the salsa, the tortillas do tend to get a bit soggy before you can finish one and get to the next, so if you're eating 3 or 4 of them like we were, your 3rd or 4th tacos will likely be ready to fall apart - this could be a problem if you like to take your time and savor your food, like I do; not so much if you just wolf it down, like the Mister. Even a little soggy, these are damn good tacos! So much so, that we came back again that Monday before we left Vegas to grab some more. This time the Mister got sesos and lengua (which he raved about) and I stuck to more asada. We tried the horchata and it was amazingly good! Not too sweet or thick like some places, it was a perfect balance of flavors.   TIP: Because there is such limited seating, they have the rule that you must already have your order and paid for it before you sit at a table. It's a good rule, to keep things fair and so that people who are ready to eat can sit and enjoy their food while those still in line don't need to waste space; but like most rules, there are always people who don't know how to follow it - so good luck on going to what looks like an empty table only for some douche to say, \"Oh these seats are taken.\" Me, I would have sat anyway, the Mister is far nicer than I am, though, and found us seats a couple tables down. Not before the broads in line who were the \"seats taken\" heard me saying, \"If their asses aren't in the seats then they're not taken.\"   Still, we were able to enjoy another round of delicious tacos and left Vegas happy! Definitely will be a regular spot whenever we hit up this town!!!",

I do not know how they can make it better, but it was difficult to order.   We had pretty much everything on the menu.  I would recommend the adobado tacos all the way.

Chorizo was great as well but al pastor was the real winner here. You can ask for sides of sauce if you'd like as well. The line situation appears confusing at first but it's basically: wait in line for which meat you want and use a tray to move to different lines for different tacos. The final line is to pay. Large style table seating but the lines can be long. I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "In a city of good food, this place stands out, which really says something. The constant revolving door of people is no joke. This place is more popping than some buffets in Vegas. Food: Al pastor. Sliced off a huge spit of dripping marinated pork. Absolutely the crowd favorite. Warning, it is pretty spicey may not be sutable for young mouths. I tried all the meats because they all smelled so good! The second winner, the Lengua was nice and juicy and they give you a plentiful amount. Sadly the most disappointing meat was the Asada, it was the saltiest taco I've ever had. Maybe the cook had a bad day or an oopsie, but super sad because I knew the meat is tender and would have been delicious if I tasted more than just NaCl. Ambience: Great drunchie meal, after a night at Surrender. Also great for families, in fact most of the patrons were families. Price: Not as cheap as 1.50 a taco( they raised their prices) Still pretty cheap meal though! Around 10 for 3 tacos and a drink. Vegas food is pretty cheap so if your really hungry go to a buffet but if you just want a meal-snack hybrid these tacos will hit the spot for a few bucks you won at Circus Circus.",

Now I've been to the other location on a taco crawl I knew what to expect when our friends asked us to come grab tacos here.   We go in line for the al pastor as that was the majority of what we needed, then tipped out the station for them to get the other stations to make our other tacos simultaneously and tip out those stations as well. Or if you are in a group of friends, have someone in each line ordering for the group and split the cost among yourselves. We were here at 11ish and the line took 25 minutes.   I had -   Al pastor - this pastor was decent. Not too fatty, the seasonings were good. I like the avocado sauce they put on it, as well as the salsa on it. Ask for pineapple too! I think if I go here, I will probably just get this meat in various vessels (tacos, vampiros, fries, etc).   Cabeza - there was crispy edges to this which was different. The flavor of it was just OK though and there are cabezas I far prefer around town. I noticed they dip the tortillas at this station in the grease for flavor, but that made my taco also a bit soggy. It was better the last time I had them.   I got a plate of the green onions and peppers as well (these are free) and the green onions is probably my favorite thing about this place.   I don't want to do this very often as I absolutely hate the cattle line system. Maybe I'm coming off like a brat, but I've stood in lines for many of foods with zero complaints as there are some things worth the inconvenience and time spent. These are good tacos, but not the greatest taco in town as they are hailed to be. Great late night spot, specially for tourists, but I will rarely visit and will go to the Charleston one if I can help it.",

    "text": "Love this place. Whenever I go to Vegas, I'm prepped to drop a couple hundo at whatever, no expenses are spared when it comes to fun. But this shining jewel on the strip is where I can get a great meal at a fantastic price.  Tacos are $2 or $3 each! Tons of meat choices: carne asada, chicken, lengua, shoulder, etc. They make them right in front of you so it's nice and hot.   There are canopies outside for you to sit which are a godsend considering you're in the middle of the desert and it gets toasty.   This place is a bit far from the Cosmo, Caesar's, and the like. Closer to Circus Circus but if you're itching to save some bucks on your food, then there's no better place.",

We stood in line for a good fifteen minutes while I pondered my choices and schemed how I would force the others to get more things that I wanted to steal. But just when we had moved up a bit in line, some worker came around and informed us that our line (which was one out of like fucking five thousand or something) was ONLY for al pastor tacos. That's about the most retarded system I've ever heard of. If you want to try more than one thing, you either have to pick some special super-secret line OR spend a few hours eating tacos while waiting in various lines. I'm not even sure where you pay. We ended up leaving, along with a bunch of other angry drunk people who didn't want to eat only al pastor tacos.",

However, the walk was worth it and I was quite pleased with the tacos here!   I am always in the mood for some tacos and Tacos El Gordo has a good amount of options, except they don't have chicken, which is the lamest kind of taco you could get anyway....   You basically stand in line for the kind of meat you want and it could get a little hectic, so brace yourself. I got 2 carne asada tacos, which I thought were a little too dry, 1 head meat taco which was super tasty, and 1 spicy pork which was delicious!!   This place is worth a visit if you're willing to make the trip here!! The food is good and cheap compared to most of the places on the strip.",

My girlfriend has been raving about this place since we started dating because apparently there is one in San Diego and it has the best Tacos in that nation. When we had arrived on a Monday afternoon, it was still packed! At that moment I was pretty excited to try the Adobada tacos because people were lining up for this place on a weekday.   Finally we had arrived at the counter and had ordered 3 Adobada tacos each person and it did not disappoint! It was by far the best tacos I have eaten. We both pretty much inhaled it in a matter of minutes. The Adobada tacos because the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was on point. We also got the Horchata to wash it down. Best combo! This place definitely worth the hype and worth the wait. I'm glad we came here and will definitely be visiting this place again.  I can't wait to come back and order their other signature dishes!  TACO HEAVEN :)  5 Stars!",

We asked the cashier and she explained it well.  You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco.   We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.  We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars!   We didn't try the other items.  We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long.   Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that.   Definitely will be back.",

Green and red salsa - the green was surprisingly spicy - I really liked it. The staff was helpful and kept bringing us extra tortillas, napkins, and salsa. The service was 5 stars and we left a monster tip!!! Easily exceeded my expectations after reading about 5 reviews - it IS THE REAL DEAL!!!

    "text": "Oh my sweet baby jesus. I have a new love in my life (sorry Ray L.), adobado street tacos from El Gordo!  I will tell you about my tastes for one second. I am a minimalist. I usually order things on the side or plain, especially with Mexican food. I do this because my tongue can't handle much heat despite the fact that I am 1/2 Mex. So, my honey and I met at The District to take our son to My Gym on V-Day, and he brought along tacos from El Gordo to surprise me. I had never had their food before this. I opened up the plate, and was thrown off because the pork looked like the sweet pork from Chinese places. You know how it is slightly reddish on the outside? Okay, mine was meat and tortilla only and his had a mix of cilantro/onion plus a few pieces of pinapple on top. To be honest here....I totally lifted my nose to the idea of fruit with my taco. When we were done there happened to be one taco left. I just couldn't let it go to waste! I took a bite with everything on it and.....IT WAS SO GOOD!  Now I wish my other tacos were like that. The lesson to my story is this:  If you don't step outside your comfort zone once in a while, you will let all the joys of life pass you by!  These delicious tacos from heaven only cost $2 each. No rice and beans available here, but I don't give a damn. Who wants to stuff yourself with fillers? The crowds are huge at lunchtime but it's only because these little yummies are a force to be reckoned with. By far, they are the best Las Vegas has to offer.",

There is no chicken, fish, ground beef, vegetables, rice or beans. What they have is: beef brain, tripe, lengua (tongue) and some sort of fatty pork cut from a large skewer, and a few other combinations of these. Maybe this is authentic Mexican tacos, but the average AMERICAN diner will probably not be happy. Yes the tacos are 2 dollars, but hey are very small. The average male would probably want 4 to 6 tacos.",

    "text": "Taco-flavored kisses for Tacos El Gordo!  Despite the number of time I've been to Vegas, I wouldn't consider myself a \"Vegas person.\" I dunno, everything on the strip seems to run together after a while, and you can't really tell the difference between this place and that. Enter Tacos El Gordo! You have to walk a bit away from the action to get to it - just north of the Wynn and Encore, Tacos El Gordo is located in a weird little strip mall next to a souvenir shop. They have seating indoor and out.  When I walked in, I was faced with a food station directly in front of me and a cashier to my right, horchata/bang/soda machine on the left. I was totally confused as to where to order and how to pay. It must have showed on my face because one of the guys behind the counter where the cooks were smiled and called to me. He took my order, barked it at the cooks and told me to wait there, then pay when I got my food. I was totally surprised at how cheerful all the employees where. Great customer service is definitely not something I seek out when I'm eating at hole in the walls, but every employee greeted me with a smile and was happy to serve me. When the cook handed over my food, he asked to make sure the order was right, gave me a big smile and told me to enjoy. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.  I had the carne asada fries, an asada taco, chicken quesadilla, and an a pork taco (I was sharing with a friend OKAY?). Everything was perfectly delicious. The carne asada fries were huge, enough to feed 2 to 3, possibly 4 people. The tacos come overflowing with meat, and the horchatas and bang juices are refillable. Woohoo! I felt like I struck gold with this place. And our whole bill was only $20. I think it was the least amount of money I had spent on a meal that satisfying in Vegas. If you're looking for some good, cheap Mexican food on the strip, drive or walk a little further, Tacos El Gordo is worth it.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite late night eating spot in LV.  I used to have so much trouble finding a spot to eat when I was staying at the Wynn or Encore, since Fat Burger and Earl of Sandwich is so far away.      It's a long story on how I found this place, but it involves a rental car, spending $5 on a bottle of water and the Hoover Dam.  Anyway, this place is pretty awesome.  They have a Carne Asada Fries plate that is as big as your head (you can get a smaller version for half the price, but why do that to yourself? they're that good.).  The tacos and quesadillas are also really good.  My friend said the spicy pork tastes like chinese bbq pork and the quesadillas are not the ones that most people are used to.  It's more like a flat taco with a fried tortilla on top.    The staff here is really friendly too.  The guy making the tacos and cutting pork from the meat slab was having a conversation with almost everyone that came in.  So if you're coming from XS, Tryst, Surrender, Blush, etc. and you're drunk or babysitting a drunk, then you should just walk to this spot.  There's also a good Mediterranean food place and a 24 hour Korean BBQ restaurant in the strip mall, so you have options.  There is also a Tacos El Gordo in Downtown LV, but I'm not sure if it's still open.",

Limes and horseradish sides by the pop and straws. My favorites were the steak and spicy pork. Beef shoulder wasn't nearly as good...a little more dry.  Each comes with guac, usually a condiment specific to the taco you get, onion, cilantro.   If you want to really treat yourself, arrive when they open at 1030 AM and get the steak fresh to order. Great to have an alternative to the over-priced/under-valued food options on the strip.  Highly recommend!",

My sope came with giant slices of well cooked adobada, which was finally covered in some light chili sauce. The sope was soft and moist.   While I was standing in line, I met some Tacos el Gordo regulars, who said that the al pastor and adobada were the same in flavor. This made me feel a bit better about not getting a second meat dish. Oh how I wish we had, had more time to order other items. We were waiting in line for over 45 minutes and our anxiety levels continued to rise. Our show was starting at 7 pm, so we decided to order a few things and book it back to the theater.   Expect to wait for a long,long time to even get into the building. Then you will have to wait to order your food. There are 5 counters and only certain meats are served at each. This means you will have to dance around in different counters' lines. This was so disorganized and inefficient.  However, the food is amazing and is as authentic as you can get. I am most definitely coming back with plenty of time to spare and a large appetite.",

First of all it was 110 degrees outside and the A/C was not even on inside! Then when I went to order my food, the guy was sweating alot and he kept cleaning himself with his shirt on the top shoulder side. Disgusting!! Ok, so he gave me the tacos and the pieces of meat weren't even cut into small pieces (as tacos should be) So lazy! So I said the taste should be good... WRONG!!! They had no flavor! So bland. Ok sooo whatever they were disgusting tacos I would never go back and that was it. WRONG! The main reason that I'm reviewing this place is because after we left I went to the store on the side to buy some gifts also to walk out the nasty food I had consumed after like 5 minutes I began getting nauseous and then obviously throwing up to relieve my nausea. Had to go back to my room cause I felt ill right away. Fucked up my whole evening/night in vegas. Smdh! Will never, ever, EVER go back!!",

I don't know how I managed that because, according to other reviews, it's always busy.  When it is busy, make sure you get in the right line.  If you're in the Asada line and you want adovada, you're SOL.  Stand in line according to what type of tacos you want.  I love the pork because it has a spicy/sweet sauce on it and lots of crunchy onions.  They also have Orange Bang! which makes this girl super happy.  If you actually want a cheap delicious meal on the strip, this is one of the few places you'll find one.",

You'll see a few different lines so make sure you're standing in the right one for the right kind of meat.  The lines get long I know BUT they move kinda fast. Make sure you already know what you want when you get to the front. After ordering and getting your food you'll move on to the cashier area to pay and you're all set !",

I ordered 3 asada tacos and one came with a nice portion of avocado salsa and red salsa, and the next two were topped with very little of it. Wont stop me from coming back next time i'm in vegas. Only thing, next time i will only order the adobada because it was that good!!!",

The tacos are topped with this amazing green cream sauce, onions and salsa. It's so simple yet so AMAHHZING. and the homemade tortillas? perfect consistency.

The adobada isn't actually spicy so it was easy to devour the tacos. The fries have some green sauce drizzled all over it that my friend likes to call \"crack\" sauce since it is so addictive.

The wait was around 20 minutes on a Saturday night at 8:30. You order first and then bring your food to the other side of the restaurant to pay...the honor system seems to work for them. I don't know how they keep track of who has paid and who hasn't. This place is pretty cool! The tacos are about the size of your palm...I had 3 and my hub had 5. We were both full and happy!

When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!  Here's how it works: there are different \"stations\" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.    I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.  BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!",

    "text": "I got hooked on Carne Asada tacos while living in San Diego many years ago.  Outside of California, it can be difficult to find authentic mexican tacos.  We ordered the Campechana fries which consists of carnea asada and spicy pork.  The meal was enough for two people and for $13, that's a steal on the strip.  Ordering can be hectic as there are multiple lines and you have to pay attention to which line you're in.  You can't order carne asada from every line.  Also the seating arrangement can be a headache too.  The place is small on the inside so all of the tables are side by side except the ones along the wall.  You may end up sitting and eating next to somoene while at the same time bumping elbows.  Everyone was pleasant when I was there, lets hope the same for you since you're nearly sitting in each other's lap. Expect a long line if you go during lunch like we did.  They even had \"security guards\" letting so many people in the building at a given time.  From the time we arrived to finally sitting down and eating was a little over an hour.  Worth the wait though!",

The lines are a bit confusing too. It took me a while to find out where I was suppose to pay. In all easily the best tacos I've tried in Las Vegas",

My friends and I were all getting tired, but we had to drive back to Saint George that night and everyone wanted tacos. We tried other places, but most of them were 21+ and one of my friends wasn't 21, so we found Tacos El Gordo.  When we got there, it seemed to have a long line trailing outside, but it didn't take long until we were inside ordering. Their spicy pork tacos are to die for! And if you order peppers and onions, beware! They are super tasty, but way spicy (and I can handle a lot of spice)! I have recommended this to everyone going to Vegas because it is totally worth it and is super close to everything on the strip. Go to Tacos El Gordo, you won't regret it!!!",

I knew about the individual lines for the various kinds of tacos and i knew there would be a language barrier if I didn't speak Spanish. So be it, I can point and smile and I came out with actually more tacos than I wanted...but oh well. The drink station is not very well thought out or placed, you get your cups after you pay . And the cashiers were nice and friendly and the horchata wasn't that bad.    But it's a taco place..and the tacos...really aint all that. Lengua....not impressed, as it was actually kinda cold when I got to try it...I ended up not eating all of it. Al pastor...was nothing special either. But I really looked forward to the Adobada...and it was the only taco that saved me from going home hungry. If I go back it's the only thing I'll buy again.   That being said Taco y Taco's adobaba blows El Gordo out of the water...it's not even close.   Recommendation: If you're stuck on the strip and don't want to pay strip prices it will shut your stomach up. But if it's not late and you can drive a bit, there are much better choices available.",

We told the cab driver where we wanted to go, he said, no you have to try here and thats how we found this place.    The food here was so freaking good! I spent 3 days in California with my cousin and had mexican at places that I thought had the best food, but after going here, I was proven wrong.   First of all we had no idea what we were doing or what anything was.  But i knew it was going to be awesome because of all the cops eating there.  I went up to a cop and asked him a few questions about what to order and what he recommended.  10 minutes later we walked out of there with a giant bag full of food.    I wish i could give specifics on what we ordered, but honestly, I don't really remember.  We just took the cops recommendations and then when the guy behind the counter started asking us questions, I said \" I have no idea, just make it like you would eat it.\"    Everything was so delicious! It was the best Mexican food I ever had.  I strongly recommend getting the spicy pork.  It was delicious.  I wish we got everything with spicy pork.  This is a place I will definitely visit when i go to vegas next time, and I know I will be craving their food in the near future!",

Their adobada was dry and bland. And their horchata is a fountain drink.......   Almost $3 for each taco and they're small..  4 lines to order...... but by the time I ordered my food from each line and went to pay, my food was cold.  There were people smoking inside the restaurant even though it says no smoking.. and there's flies flying everywhere at their salsa bar..  Honestly, this place is not that good.

They share the same plaza as some Korean BBQ shops, so they have free parking in their small lot.  It's in a \"take your valuables with you\" kind of area.  The tacos are yum!  They cut the adobada meat right in front of you!  They have two separate lines for their most popular adobada (pork).  The third line is if you want to order other things, like fries, mulitas, sopes, etc, or if you want other meats.  Get the grilled veggies/peppers!  You get your food and then pay in the back corner of the restaurant.  Fountain drinks, condiments, and salsa bar are also in the back.  SO GOOD FOR LATE NIGHT",

And the gentlemen cooking and playing food are also putting the raw meat on the grill. I was excited to taste these tacos until he got the container of raw meat and started grabbing it with his gloves on and putting it on the grill.  Mind you he had already cooked meat under the pan of raw meat. Juices just sprinkling all over the cooked meat on the cutting board. Watched him put the pan of remaining raw meat back into the small cooler close to the stove..  gloves never came off.. Opened the cooler with the bloody raw meat gloves..  closed the cooler. Grabbed his drink and drank it and returned to grab tortillas and fill them with the cooked and ready to serve ingredients.. all with the same gloves.. yuckkkkk!!  I eat here every time I'm in Vegas and it's never been an experience like it was this trip. The process of getting your food to the process of their cook like.. all down the tubes!",

Right when you walk in, there are 3 separate lines to order your tacos. The lines are differentiated by if you want El Pastor, Carne Asada, Abodabo? (Sorry I can't remember the spelling), and there are more speciality tacos that they create as well.   Each taco is made within the minute so service is very fast. Once you have your tacos you go to a separate line to pay for the tacos. They also sell desserts such as the flan. My family tried almost every taco and also got the carne Asada fries which were to die for!! Every taco had its own kick so it is to your taste buds as to what kind of taco you are feeling that day. And if you're not picky with what kind of meat you have in your taco like me then you can eat any of their tacos and it will be delicious. Everything is at such a good price for quality food, I wish there was across my house because I would honestly get a taco everyday!!",

The first time I went here, I ordered the most conservative item in carne asada fries and tacos as well as a single adobada taco. The carne asada was on the smokier side and isn't what I'm used to. It wasn't bad, but just didn't fit my taste palate as it usually does. Sadly, by the time I got to the adobada taco, I was too full to order more. My second visit here, I made no mistake and indulged in all of the adobada glory. The tender, sweet, and juicy meat is to die for! Simply put, definitely get the adobada and sample the other meat choices to your liking. They have a radish and lime bar in the back, but I think they keep their salsa in the refrigerator behind the cashier. Overall, Tacos El Gordo is one of my favorite places to dine in while in Vegas.",

    "text": "As a SoCal native, I was so happy to finally taste the real deal again- warm, chewy, fresh tortillas so good you could eat them on their own! I didn't even put any salsa on it and still savored every bite. Delicious!  I ordered cheese quesadillas so I have no input on the taste of the meat but judging by the line, they have lots of fans. This is a legit taco shop serving tacos de lengua, cabeza, y carne asada. Lines are always long but they move fast and the ordering system runs like a well-oiled machine. Even with another location less than a block away, the place is constantly packed so the seating can be a challenge so the cleanliness of the tables can be as well. The inside and the patio were full even though it was 55 degrees outside. There's nothing fancy about this place but they don't try to be fancy and that's part of the charm. I definitely recommend.",

It's good this place offers both small or large sizes of fries, so we were able to try the small size fries with our already massive order of tacos.  All the meats were of different textures and flavors, and a delight to eat.  The only inconvenience was the different lines you have to get in to order different kinds of meat (carne asada, al pastor, and all the other meats).  Though it was totally worth the long wait (about an hour) and super crowded dining spaces.  Will stop by again if have the chance.",

It's about a 10 minute walk from the Convention Center in a sleezy-looking strip mall (filled with souvenir shops, AYCE Korean buffet,  AYCE Indian buffet and foot massage parlors) but it is quintessential tacos at their best.   At first glance, it looks like you would most likely get sick from eating here, but no, no, no..... so good.   I had the lengua and adobo (spicy pork) and I wish I got more.   They are cheap!  $2.25 a taco and a soda machine with Mexican sodas (I noticed that nobody was at that soda fountain.... instead they were all at the regular Coke/Sprite/Fanta machine so I just wound up getting a cup of water).  The seating is limited -- I wound up eating outside while standing next to the trash can..... but it was really an experience!   So rather than eating at the Denny's down the street or shopping the food section at Walgreens, just know that this is a tried-and-True taco shop.  So amazing! Worth the walk from the convention center, and frankly, any place on the strip if you are looking for great food and a real bargain!",

It is still a packed crowd, but not as bad as the Friday/ Saturday night crowd. Out of the handful of times I have came, I have only came on a Friday night ONCE! That might be the last time we do that.   Don't be fooled by the small appearance of these tacos... they can really fill you up. Order what you can honestly handle. Then if you are still hungry, it will be a matter of \"how hungry?\" and \"how long am I willing to wait?\"   My go-to items are the pork \"adobada\" tacos, Steak 'Carne Asada' tacos, and pork sopes. I have tried the carne asada fries, but it is quite overwhelming (and that was just the 'half order'). If you do order the fries... it should be a) the only thing you eat... or b) you are going on a Man vs Food challenge.   Tacos are $2/ each. Specialty items (i.e. Sopes) are $4.   Seating can be a challenge here (esp. if you come during the Friday/ Saturday night crowd). We ended up eating at the car that night.",

Easily one of the most amazing words in the world to say when drunk, it turns out it may also be the single most delicious thing one can eat while drunk, though there is competition*  Additionally, while my bubby would be heartbroken to hear this, I have to say that this place serves what is hands-down the best tongue I've ever had in my life. Ever. Though you'd better not be shy about what you're ordering, because saying \"lengua\" to the counterman means he's about to pull out the entire grass-licker of a cow and chop it apart in front of you.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be Hannibal Lecter's sous chef, now you'll know.  *They also serve Carne Asada fries, which is a 1 pound orgy of french fries, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.

I know that Tacos El Gordo are a big thing in TJ which I am very familiar with their quality and authentic tacos.  Anyways, I ordered 8 tacos de asada and 1 de pastor. As I took my bite (bang) sub-zero temperature tacos. Took the tacos back to the taquero and he blame the aguacate and salsa for making the tacos cold. There was no way in 3 minutes that took me to pay and sat down that could be that case. Nevertheless, I got them replace with everything on the side including cilantro, onion, salsa, and aguacate. Thats the reason they got 1 extra star.  I wont be coming back to this location anymore I'll rather safe my cravings for the real TJ Tacos El Gordo.",

I was really unsatisfied by the food I was eating at the hotels and on the Strip and this place is just down the street from where I was staying.    I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in SD and wanted to see what the LV branch tasted like.   I came at around 11am in the morning and there was no line and ample indoor seating. Ordered my tacos and bit into the asada taco to find cold meat. I was really surprised. I know that the meat is cooked in a batch and used to make tacos and then another batch is cooked, but still - no reheating the asada on the grill? To top that off, the meat was a little tough so I was a bit displeased.   The savior of the bunch was the lengua tacos. I could just gobble down lengua tacos all day because the meat is so soft and juicy. Juice literally sputters out at every bite!  I immediately regret getting the asada taco.   Ordering is fast and efficient when there isn't a line. This establishment is spotlessly clean (well at least it was in the morning). Stainless steel tables and walls - and even the bathroom was spotless. Whaaaaaat.   So even if my asada was cold, I was a happy camper. Later on while driving home I could still smell the tacos on my fingers and my mouth would water. A sign of REAL food.   Skip the over-priced Strip and come here!",

The adobada is extremely popular and usually has a long line but don't forget about the lengua or cabeza which are my personal favorites.  All of the tacos are very fresh being that they do so much business it feels like you're ordering \"a la minute\" and range from $2.00-$2.50 each.  Must get is also the grilled green onions and jalapenos which are complimentary for your order.",

While it is on Las Vegas Blvd, I wouldn't really consider it walking distance from even the Wynn/Encore, which is the nearest major hotel. Also, when you come in there are various lines for different types of meat, but if you just talk with the cooks they'll help you out and get you what you want to order. You don't have to go to the right line.  Also, they offer free cebolitas, including grilled green onions and a jalapeno pepper, and also free pineapple with the spicy pork/adobada/al pastor (these are all the same thing here). You have to ask :)  The different meats also come with different sauces as defaults. So don't be surprised by that!  I thought the spicy pork/adobada/al pastor was by far the best, though I had no complaints about the carne asada either!",

It basically is the last stop before you hit crappy old town Vegas and sorry if you are a resident of old town Vegas, I mean \"crappy\" in the nicest way possible.  The line was ridiculous, it was a like a Mexican ride at Disneyland, throngs of people clamoring to get a taste of the goodness. Delicious meat-scented smoke was wafting from the interior beckoning us in.  We were lucky enough to nab a table and the line moved surprisingly quick. Simply put, get the spicy pork and lengua tacos. The carne asada was pretty wack but the aforementioned spicy pork and tongue was ahhhh-mazing. Oh and be sure to ask for the grilled onions and peppers, it really puts the experience over the top.  Whether you decide to have this before your evening of binge-drinking or after to mitigate the monstrous hangover you will surely have, I highly recommend it.",

The outside booths aren't covered, and someone obviously didn't think it thru - plastic and vinyl booths sitting in 100+ degree desert sun? Nobody will be able to sit there. Looks like they just opened, but they'll have to figure out a solution pretty soon (tent like at playgrounds?).",

The only down fall  is they should have you pay for your food first then stand in line to get it. Me and family were here this weekend and have eaten here 3 times but had an issue with over payment. Customer service should always come first you should never tell a customer that you can't assist their issues because you have a long line. Other than that this is a great place to eat.",

The tacos were really well priced, one of our cheapest meals in Vegas. But the quality was definitely high! The meats really shine, with deep flavors and spices. The toppings are bare, but that allowed for the pure flavors to come through. You can't go wrong with options, but I really liked my chorizo and carne asada tacos. Be sure to snag some limes and radishes by the door!  For a late lunch, each of us had 3 tacos. We arrived around 3/3:30pm, so there were minimal lines.  I like where this one is situated - at the top portion of the Strip. It's refreshing to see another part of the Strip (though I definitely suggest getting off the Strip entirely). It's much less hectic on this part.",

When we got there I thought I walked in to something from the \" Twilight Zone\"; different lines to order different meats tacos & then go to another line to pay, and after paying, sit down to eat your cold tacos after you dealt with handling money to pay for your tacos!!! It seems like the person that created this system has too much pride to change a failed ordering system!!! Let us not forget that the tacos were 2 thumbs down; not much flavor with either adobada, carne asada, and salsas!!! I told my wife, if this is the kind of tacos they continue to serve, they should not expand to L.A.; they will not be able to compete in this \"real tacos\" city!!! Word of advice; have customers order & pay for their tacos upfront first, with option to order different meat tacos with out going to different line(s)!!!",

The food is very tasty, 4 star in terms of taste but the way the restaurant is run is very odd.  This place is very popular and there's usually a line waiting out the door from videos and pictures that I've seen.  As the name suggests, this place is all about tacos done many different styles.  There's chorizo, lingua, Al pastor, cabeza and many more!  Depending on the type of taco you want, you have to stand in a specific line that makes them.  So if you want 2 or 3 types, you might have to stand in 2 or 3 lines.  It is a MUST to come in a group if you want to try multiple types without standing in different lines wasting time.  I'm not sure if how the restaurant runs is a result of popularity or based off some tradition.  The staff speaks little English and caters to Spanish speakers.  Indoor and outdoor seating is offered but it's a fight to even get seats(we were a group of 2).  Food is good but restaurant service is a mess.",

    "text": "I've been here twice & the food has always been really good... and this has become one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I'm pretty adventurous with food, so my party ordered: Carne Asada Fries, Taco de Lengua (beef tongue), Taco de Cabeza (beef head), Lengua Fries, Taco de Adobada (spicy pork), & Adobada fries.  [FOOD] * All were really really good! The lengua was my fav, and cabeza has a bit of a gamy taste.   * Their fries were also really good... And HUGE portions. They're apparently known for their Adobada fries, but I wasn't a fan for some reason. I preferred the other 2 fries over this.  * They also have my favorite drink: Jamaica Tea (hibiscus tea) & it's perfectly sweetened, and free refills! Score!!!  * I believe corn tortilla is the default for their tacos. I prefer flour tortilla & they're able to provide that instead... And it's a little bigger too!  * They have this green sauce they put on their fries (cilantro aioli type) and it's soo good! I asked for extra sauce to add to my tacos   * They provide a pretty generous amount of guacamole on their fries  [PRICE] * Reasonable & similar to Robertos & other fast food style Mexican restaurants. Although their fries are a little more expensive ($12 for a full size, $7 for half), their portion sizes make up for it.   [ORDERING] * This can be a little confusing; You order first at 1 window, wait for your food, then walk over to the other side of the room to pay.  * They keep their hot sauce with the cashier. It's free, but they keep it refrigerated. I'm not sure why they don't display them together with the veggies.  [Restaurant] * It's more fast food/to-go style: you order, receive your food, and pay at different counters.   * There are people cleaning the tables & removing empty containers while you're still at the tables, but no ones serving you.  * It's actually pretty clean for a restaurant on the Strip. Most fast food joints on the Strip are a bit janky. But, this isn't too bad!  It's a bummer the closest location to me is this one (on the Strip) & I wish they had one on the west side so I could eat here more often.",

They have roasted peppers and green onions as well (those were free). The tacos are under $3 and are worth it. Street style, corn tortillas so they are great. Add some radishes and an orange bang, you now have one of the best meals for an amazing price in all of Las Vegas. Definitely will be back again!",

I recommend this taqueria/restaurant.  The minus star is for the setting on placing order and paying for food. They have seperate lines for placing orders on different meat items and a separate line across to pay the cashier! chaotic! Especially, when you have a crowd and the lines are out the door and you are trying to get across to the cashier with your food,is just a challenge! Good luck finding a place to sit down to eat.

The menu is very basic, you tell the cook what you want and they cook it up right in front of you. I think I had steak tacos...I can't remember. I think boo had the same thing. They were pretty good but it was nothing exciting to me. I think I was still on a high from the 24 hour joint in San Diego. I guess I should have gotten the spicy pork tacos? Apparently we beat the rush because there was a super long line of people waiting to order after we sat down and ate. They have soft drinks that taste like floats that are pretty tasty.",

    "text": "These tacos are as good as it gets to an actual street taco from across the border.  The adobada are my favorites, whether in a taco, quesadilla, mula, or fries.   Late night on the strip, after a long day of walking, partying, and gambling, this place hits the spot like no other.   The variety of meats are great, more than the typical carne asada or carnitas option. Suadero, tripas, or buche are something worth trying along with cabeza and  lengua.    Due to the variety, there are 3 lines to choose from and during peak times, which is all the time I've gone with a line out the door and a security guard controlling entry due to fire code, you cannot order from another line without getting in it at the end. Meaning, if I order adobada and want asada I have to get in that line then get in the suadero line if I feel like trying those, in the meantime and 45 min later my tray with tacos is getting cold.   The 3 lines are the carne asada & chorizo line, the adobada line, and the everything else or sweetbread line.  The security guard is also well versed on all the meat options and she will point you in the right direction.   My gripe is that due to the same variety, the system of ordering from possibly 3 different lines then paying at a different line before you sit and eat is archaic. With so many people crowding to order and being limited to order from a single variety is not a good business model. It's a simple fix from my p.o.v. - order and pay at a counter, then pick up when ready. Or, do the Subway/Chipotle/Pieology method and just move on down the line and order any cut of meat you'd like and skip the ones you don't. There just has to be a better way is all I'm saying and with that many people paying, the resources should be there to give the customers better service.   I try and get here every time I come to Vegas, and I'm sure under normal circumstances you would be able to order anything you'd like. But since this place is so good and so crowded, ordering from the 3 lines of meats is not practical, hampering the experience.",

Also , they would serve the cilantro and salsa for you not all the tacos go with guacamole so it's depend what meat you choose for them to add the guacamole.

    "text": "I've been searching for a new \"go-to\" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!  We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks \"How many more do you want?\".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.  I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!  It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.       I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.",

I'm a transplant here to Ventura County.  Just look at the reviews of Sabor. Unfortunately people are  still ranking that place up so they'll be a while before the break a thousand of fake bs stars.  Fake reviews everywhere be careful.  Sort the reviews by the negative ones first - Get the truth.  How do you know you found something legit?  When you got thousands of 4 plus starts come on.... That aint fake.  Tacos El Gordo let me invest... What's your IPO? Don't fix something that doesn't need fixing.  These guys are masters in simplicity and quality.",

No air condition swamp coolers instead Rabid flies especially outside Seriously smokey from the cooking Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red When grabbing a tray to place food on it my hand came in contact with something sticky There was so much going on in the kitchen I'm not sure what I saw but there was blood. I'm pretty sure on the floor.

I have to say the quality of their meat is pretty darn good it's not all full of fat and gristle.  We tried a variety of tacos and a mula which is a quesadilla with meat. At $2 a pop you can't go wrong. Seating can be a problem sometimes it can get pretty crowded, they also have outdoor seating but with the heat I prefer the ac. It's a noisy hole in the wall but I like those kind of places.  It is clean,tidy and we at least make 2 stops here while in Vegas.",

    "text": "Craving TJ style tacos at 4 AM while on the Vegas strip?  This is the place to be for your taco craving in the City of Sin.  Finally, I found a place in Vegas who serves street tacos and is open after a night of drunken bliss.  We stumbled into there about 4 AM and saw the line pouring outside the door on a Saturday night/Sunday morning.  A crowd mainly comprised of Latin descent and a good mixture of other cultures was a clear indication that this was the place to be for authentic street tacos.    READ THIS PORTION CAREFULLY!!!!!  Okay so when you make your approach to the restaurant you need to determine what kind of tacos you want.  From what I remember (I was pretty inebriated), there were three UNIDENTIFIED lines.  Starting from the left as you face the kitchen, line #1 consisted of the carne asada line.  You tell your order to the taco chef but be aware that the designated lines represent the specific type of meat you want on your food.  Line #2 is the adobada line, and #3 is the tripas and cabeza line.  There were other types of meats but I can't remember which line you can get them at.  So if you are a taco eating machine like myself, you want to try all the meats strictly for the purposes of providing fellow yelpers a True, well educated opinion on the good and the bad of services provided to the general public, more specifically an educated opinion from me regarding street tacos.  Not to nurse your future hangover in Vegas, because hangovers NEVER happen in the City of Sin.    Unless you only want one type of meat on your tacos, be sure to tacticallly plan your approach to the taco masters and be sure you are in the right line.  Unfortunately we learned the hard way and did not split our resources to different lines.  We ordered the asada tacos and had to fall in the tripas line to score my tripas, cabeza, and adobada  taco fix.  I wasn't  going to fall in the herrendous adobada line, so I worked smarter not harder and had someone much better looking than me who wore heels and had bigger and better goods for these taco guys to look at than my taco eating mug place the adobada taco order even though she was in the tripas line.  Apparently it worked because we scored what we wanted.  Till next time Tacos El Gordo.....We shall meet again and hopefully I won't have to resort to the egotistical motto that women always get what they want and how men use them.",

To start of, this place did not meet my expectations, very small crowded and not much room for guest to sit. Aside from that, the food was not tasty at all very bland. And let's not forget about the service, the lady at the cashier charged us for water bottles and when we corrected her and told her we didn't want them she told us she could not take it off and we're forced to pay for them, and was very rude afterwards as well. How ridiculous is that, let's just say we're never coming back to this place.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo is the only place to go for real authentic tasting tacos at very affordable prices!  Located right on the strip, this is a very popular spot and is usually very busy.  They have a tasty selection of food to choose from.  I ordered the Tacos Adobada (spicy pork) and Tacos Asada along with a Sope Asada .  The Tacos Adobada was sooo mouth watering delicious! The pork was so tender and the salsa sauce was flavorful.  The Asada tacos and Sope were really good too, but the Adobada was the winner.  When it is crowded (which is usually all the time) ordering can be a little confusing, especially if it's your first time. They have several counters where the meat is prepared.  Above the counters are the menus the items you can order from that counter. You pick up a tray go to the counter and place your order. They prepare the food in front of you. While at the counter you can also order grilled jalapenos and green onions. Very yummy.    After you visited the counters you go to the register to pay and also order any drinks.   Then you find a place to sit and enjoy. There is also a salsa cart with a variety of salsas fresh radishes, and limes. They offer free refills on the fountain drinks.  The inside seating is limited, but they also offer outside seating as well.   Family owned straight out of Tijuana! They keep the prices affordable, $2 tacos! So please don't forget to Tip!! If you like the authentic feel and taste of a real taqueria, then Tacos El Gordo is a must stop when visiting Las Vegas!",

You walk in and see the meat behind the counter, place your order and watch as it is made, then take your tray up to the cashier to pay. It doesn't get fresher than this.  The lengua is amazing. I don't care how you feel about eating another animal's tongue, it's delicious- especially here, and particularly in the fries. Lengua quesadilla is also tasty, but the bottom tortilla is flour and the top is a tostada... so it's a little odd. Eat it anyway.  Best tacos were the spicy pork and the beef shoulder, honorable mention to the super-crispy tripas. Ordered all as-is with the salsas and sauces. These people know what they're doing.  Now for the lengua fries- a half order will run you $6, pricey for fries. But worth it. It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese. It sounds revolting but it's amazing, and it doesn't taste as heavy as it sounds, either- which is a bad thing because I could put away a lot of this dish.  Side note: apparently if you order the \"half order\" and tip the guy, you end up with a wink and a full order. Oops.",

I have had some of the best tacos all over California and these are hands down the best pork adobada tacos period.    Our group also ordered carne asada quesadillas and asada fries.  The \"quesadilla\" comes out as a 3\" round?  It was odd size and small but tasted delicious nonetheless.  Their carne asada fries, tasted fine and the portion was huge.  But the star of the day was the adobabda tacos.  It's a great spot for lunch or for a late night eat after a bar or club.  It is within walking distance from Encore/Wynn.  Be careful if you want multiple items from the menu.  There are different lines for the multiple items offered so be prepared to wait in multiple ones especially if there is a wait.",

So it's only natural that this place is what hits home!  Super cheap tacos and aguas frescas to wash it all down; I was in heaven. You can get full with $20 as tacos are $2 each! We ordered 6 tacos; 4 de carne asada, 1 de lengua, and 1 de sesos. Lime wedges as well as radish slices were available to complete your meal. No long lines, fast service, ample seating indoors and outdoors, and music playing while you eat!   There's nothing else to say than it felt like home the moment I walked in. We'll be coming back before we leave. I need my Mexican fix before I leave Vegas. You will be missed!!!",

I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.  The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.  There is a parking lot so if you can find a spot then you can just go back and eat in your car if you can't find a spot at the tables.",

They took over the suite to the right side of them so it made my last experience less hectic with faster order lines and more seating. The outside patio has double in size also.   Onto the food. Ooh...Mee...Gee! The adobada (spicy pork) is to die for, carved off a huge slab of flavored pork rotating inside of a flame roasting cooker. Every bite was bursting with flavor and the green guacamole cilantro sauce on top just made it that much better.    If you rather op for something other than tacos then no need to worry. They offer other items on the menu like tostadas or quesadillas. I also love the nacho fries with either adobada or carne asada meat. For those of you that can't decide between the 2 then make it a half and half. Mmmm....I could just smell the food now. DROOL!",

Because you can't eat them once you have them, You gotta go get in line again and they have to see how many tacos you have in order for you to eat them. Like you cant even take a bite because they will hunt your ass.. You gotta pay first and the tacos have to be cold in order for them to let you eat them. What type of restaurant is that? I think the best thing to do is while ordering your tacos pay them there.. Right? Also the girls working there thinking they got a fucking fancy ass place and they treat you like shit, also Fucked up attitutude. If ya'll don't like your job then fucking quit. Can't explain how fucked up that place is.  Wanna experience what I did go? check it out",

I ordered the usually Carne Asada fries and the Adobada tacos.  Maybe I came on a bad day, but the steak wasn't cooked how I like and still being a bit pink.  Having carne asada fries means the steak is grilled in my opinion.  I don't mind a little pink in my steak, but this was disappointing.

I come from Los Angeles, and know all about \"King Taco\" and \"El Taurino\" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as \"El Taurino\" if not better.   Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the \"Taco el Lengua\" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.  Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :(   Also their \"Horchata\" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily. This is my go to spot for late night tacos after work. If you are just visiting, I definitely recommend this place if you are a taco lover such as myself.",

It really is that good.    All the tacos are great, but the spicy pork is something special, which likely explains why the lines for pork are ALWAYS longer than the lines for beef.  Each line serves pork or beef, but not both, so you need to pay attention to what line you're in.    This place pulls a crowd more or less ALL THE TIME, so be prepared.  But, they are set up for a crowd, and the lines move pretty quick.  Note:  No alcohol is served, only soft drinks.",

Get a plate of free scallions and jalapenos, you just need to ask.    Very confusing ordering process for a first timer, as there are separate lines for the al pastor and other meats.  This location is very busy which ensures a quick turnover of their food, keeping things fresh and safe.  The quality of the food qualifies for a 5 rating, but factoring in the price nets this place a 4.",

I love the pork that is sliced off a rotisserie  the lengue tacos are amazing as are the asada and cabeza. Now when the wife, daughter and I are in Vegas for our annual 6 days trip, we make sure we hit up tacos elgordo atleast 3 times. Love it Love Love it",

Al Pastor tacos, were amazing!  the meat was soft and with all the fixin's (salsa, guacamole...etc) it was like heaven.  :-)   My husband LOVED the buche and the other stuff he ate, again disgusting! but hell he loved it so I guess this place gets only 4 stars for me....

After a long day of inundating glitz, there's nothing like going to an authentic, down-home taco shop for a pit stop. It is busy in here (read: pandemonium), but there is definitely a method to this madness: it's not too hard to figure out how to order and the food comes out fast. Tacos come with creamy guac and delicious meats (carne asada has to be my favorite, but the al pastor was also on point.) If you're looking to get full on $15 and in less than 30 minutes, this is the place to go!  There is no pollo aqui, be warned. It is also not vegetarian-friendly. Otherwise, encantado, El Gordo!

The tacos come out piping hot and you will pretty much burn yourself trying to stuff that hot deliciousness in your mouth. Yeah I went there.

We got a cashier that had attitude and was straight rude too. So unnecessary. I wanted to throw my food at her but of course I couldn't let those delicious tacos go to waste.  The place is open late, so it's perfect if you are craving for a good late snack.  Came a little prepared because friends sort of gave me a heads up about this place and how it works.  So I felt like a had a slight advantage as far as understanding the process.  Yet, I still arrived and was still a bit confused.  Noticed 3 separate lines. Two in which I aready knew was for ordering al pastor meat, and the other was for carne asada meat.  Apparently, the third line was to pay.  Duh! But why not put them all together? It's not a crazy idea right?  Other successful restaurants do that.  Anyway, ordered the al pastor with corn and flour tortilla and boy were they delicious.  By far, the tortilla ranks the top over the corn tortilla in taste.  I tried a little of the carne asada meat from my boyfriend's plate and it was too dry and bland for me.  I think it just needed some sauce, and dressings like the cilantro and onions.    The prices were about $2 each which was fair.  Not overly priced.  When we were eating I noticed a fourth line for lingua and other stuff.  That's crazy.  Way tooo many ridiculous and unnecessary lines.  If it's their way of being organized.  It's more disorganized than organized.  But I have to ignore all that, because the tacos will have you coming back.",

What if you want steak and beef? Well you have to get in another line which is time consuming and unorganized. I wanted fries with my tacos but felt so rushed at the front, it just didnt seem like an option  The 3 tacos were absolutely delicious and fulfilling though and I got everything on them. (Sidenote: My friend and I stomachs but got messed up later/day after because of these tacos. Could just be a single experience but still-it was the only thing we really ate that day). Doesnt' take from how good the tacos were.   If you have time to waste and want to stand in line for some good tacos, recommended by so many, then definitely stop here.",

    "text": "What more can you say about a late night taco shop located on the Las Vegas strip that has over 500 yelp reviews?  Well, let's start with: This place rocks.   Let's get into it. You need some greasy food after an epic night, and sometimes Tacos are the cure-all. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here. It's located on the northern end of the strip just passed Encore & Wynn.   There is usually a line, but it moves quick.   You have plenty of meat options for your tacos (hey now). I prefer the more adventerous stuff like lengua, cabeza & tripa. Totally worth it because everything is seasoned to perfection and greasy enough to be amazing.  If you are on vacation and have no regard for your arteries (aka if you are like me), then try the carne asada fries. It's massive and something that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people. Or just split it with someone if you are both cool with a challenge.  Read some of the other reviews now. Then grab some tacos.   This spot is bomb!",

The lines are a bit confusing as there are three separate ones depending on what you're ordering.  The spicy pork and the asada are the obvious staples although they offer tongue and other stranger meats I don't have the balls to try.  So staples it is!  The tacos are the perfect size and usually 2-3 at 2 bucks a pop will do the trick.  I recommend getting into the shorter line of the two since you can still place one order. To receive both.  They have a nice selection or horchata and plenty of seating inside and out.  The locals obviously love the place as well and I constantly see construction workers pick up huge orders for their crews.  If you're staying at the Wynn or the encore, there is NO excuse not to try this place!",

    "text": "Why have I waited so long to try this place. K.O. convinced me to come in to this place for a small snack in between meals.  I am glad she did.  The parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.  There are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.  We stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.  Adobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.  Adobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.  After you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.  Seating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.  The place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.  I would definitely come here again but maybe one of their other locations.",

I discovered Tacos El Gordo a few years back in this location, it then closed up and I found the Charleston location. Its nice to see this location back in business and quite luckily I happened upon the Cheyenne & I-15 location by chance on my way to NASCAR (this is adjacent to a gas station, so you can fill up 2 ways!)  All of their food is authentic Tijuana style tacos. Not anything like the slop of Del Taco or Taco Bell (Note: I do get a hankering for these chains a few times a year) Their lengua is tender and cabeza not chalky at all. in one word, LOVE!",

    "text": "Alright! Everyone is a winner when Tacos El Gordo opens up a new location on the strip. Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.  Why I love Tacos El Gordo:  1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them 2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five. 3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do. 4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco.  5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not).  6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.  They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.  Random note: 3 tacos @ $2.00 each plus one drink comes out to be $7.99 after tax",

We had both the spicy pulled pork and the carne asada.

After you wait in line for your tacos you go to the cash register to pay for them across the room. The tacos are okay and it's price is kind of high for tacos. Their marinated meat was pretty bomb.

    "text": "Visiting Vegas and found Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. So happy that I did! Huge 2 dollar tacos, quesadillas and fries, (no burritos), your choice of cow head, tongue, brain, tripe, steak, or spicy pork. I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I've eaten my share- this is pretty authentic, huge portions, super cheap, and most important: incredibly delicious! They also sell Mexican soda flavors like Horchata. Ended up going back again and again. This will be a stop whenever I'm in Vegas from now on.",

I was very excited to try this place out because my sister said the one in San Diego was really good, they are open late, and I assumed service would be fast.  1 out of those 3 things wasnt True.. that the food was really good!  Service is fast.  You pick a line, order what you want, and you are quickly given what you ordered. You step out of line and head to the cashier to pay cash.  They have a tortilla lady making tortillas on the spot.  The meat in our $2 tacos was such a disappointment!  It was so bland. The best part about the tacos was the tortilla, the onions, cilantro and salsa.  The pork belly was chewy and I was hoping it would be a little crispier/fried but it obviously was not.  We also had the Adobada Fries ($10) which could have used more meat; the meat was lost amongst the fries and condiments they later onto the fries.  I don't have the desire to come here again and will now drive by it without giving it a second thought.",

Because they spit roast and carve their pork tacos to order  strolled thru lunchtime last saturday and the line was going out the front door, so many ppl gotta make sure your standing in the right line, I came here for the Adobada (pork) and luckily I stood in the right line, the middle, the left is for Carne Asada and the far right is for everything else, Brains, Guts, and Quesadillas etc....  ordered 3 of the pork tacos at $2 a piece, everything includes cilantro, onions, and two house made sauces, hot sauce and crema, extra fixings you gotta hit the side bar yourself if you want radish and any other sauces  the tacos were all the hype, freshly grilled, crusted edges, juices running into the tortilla which by the way were heated simultaneously under the spit and picked up when your order is carved, to top it off, you get a slice of the that pineapple roasting on the top of mt. meat, all good, btw if you want roasted onions and peppers I think you gotta ask for it  inside/outside seating, open 10am to 5am daily, parking is hit or miss (on the strip), park in the lot around the corner  a must try if your into cheap eats, especially in Vegas",

Start with fresh-made tortillas and a variety of meats from carnitas to steak, add in a super friendly staff with plenty of smiles and suggestions, top it off with a sparkling clean visible kitchen filled with mexican music from a jukebox and you have a big winner. The al pastor with a mild avacado based salsa and a thin slice of roasted pineapple is just like being in Mexico City.  Inexpensive and good - a rare combo in Las Vegas (especially at the CES convention week).",

I recommend that customers be able to order what ever they want in 1 line and not have us jumping around in lines.   Also please offer fresh salsa and guacamole every time ( it's part of the experience).   And please step up your quesadilla game . A good quesadilla should never be out of reach.

The meat is marinated with pineapple and other flavors. They put an avocado cream sauce on it and that's what puts the tacos over the top.

Seriously, a family of 12 walked right past everyone and stood in the \"coveted\" carne asada line.  2. The staff is a little rude - but I get it they are busy. We ordered 20 tacos and when I got my onions & jalepenos I only got 2 jalepenos. I asked for more and the lady said there were a lot of people and she couldn't give me more.  3. The whole system is backwards. If they had people pay first and call out numbers it would go faster and they wouldn't lose money like the groups I saw who got there food and sat down and ate without paying.   You can see a lot going on because you are in line for so long.",

It's a little confusing when you go in because there are lines for what you want written in Spanish. I was in the right line by chance  because I don't eat pork and google translate was no help. The line moves but not fast. When I arrived the line was out the door but don't let this stop you from going or waiting these were delicious and I am contemplating going back again before I leave Vegas.",

    "text": "Seriously one of the best tacos I've ever had. This place has amazing quality tacos and I love that there are so many options besides just chicken, steak, or pork.  They have so many different cuts of beef (get the lengua, aka beef tongue!) as well as different spicy pork options.  My only negative is that it's really confusing to order from. Each station has its own meat so if you want a pork, a steak, and a beef tongue taco, you have to order from three different stations. It's not very tourist friendly - you just have to figure it out on your own.  Also they have horchata from a beverage fountain. I thought it was homemade horchata, but I was fooled when they just handed me an empty cup and told me to go fill it up myself. It was super sweet and tasted completely artificial. Definitely don't recommend this. Just stick with water.",

    "text": "I love Tacos El Gordo, whether I'm sober or drunk. I would say it's actually one of my favorite tacos ever. I especially like this location cause it's right on the Strip by Wynn / Encore. I usually get the cabeza, asada, al pastor, and lengua. Lots and lots of lengua. The meats are all super tender. I hardly use any condiments or toppings. Just some onions, cilantro, lime, and a tad of salsa. The tortilla is good too. Doesn't break like some others do.  The only downside is that there are different lines for different meats, so the best thing to do is divide and conquer. Lines are long, but they move fast. Prices are very reasonable too. $2 - $2.50 max for a taco. I get 3-4 and I'm full, but some of my friends get 8-10!",

    "text": "They definitely have an interesting way of service. There are multiple different lines depending on the type of meat you want to get. So let's say if you want al pastor and carne asada then you have to wait in two separate lines. Then once you get your food, you go to the front counter and pay.   I came in around 3pm on a Sunday. The security guards were managing the lines and told us to go to a certain line for al pastor. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were next but the guy said he ran out of meat and told us to wait in a different line. We had to start waiting in a new line for al pastor and ended up waiting another 20 minutes.   We ordered 8 al pastor tacos with pineapple for about $20. Watching the beautiful seasoned pork turn on the vertical grill was one thing, but eating it was another. The fresh corn tortillas are toasted in all the juicy drippings from the al pastor. I asked for pineapple with my tacos and I loved it as it added a refreshing taste from all the fatty oil on the tacos.   Overall, El Gordo is definitely worth the wait. If you're passing by then stop by if you want a cheap bite to eat, but be prepared to wait over 30 minutes!",

The lines are long and waiting out in the Vegas sun is no good. The place is so crowded that it's really hard to find seating, and the tables themselves are , like the building, old, dirty, and unkempt.  Moving onto the food. It was...heavenly. They only sell tacos, but they make them VERY well. I ordered a carne asada and an adobado taco and they were perfection. It was like I was consuming ambrosia from the greek gods themselves; I felt like I was eating from a dingy food cart in the heart of Mexico (that's a good thing). What's funny is that they don't have any unique sauce or special way of making these tacos. In fact they make them on the spot really quickly. The chef just slices the meat off a large rotating skewer and onto the tortilla.  However, be warned my friends, I recommend purchasing many tacos as they are quite small. To be safe, I'd order at least 4. Otherwise, you'll be waiting in that long line again under the sweltering heat of the Vegas sun.",

Ordering System: after waiting in line to get into the place, you wait in the line of the meat you want. So al pastor has their own line and the other meats are in another. After ordering, you go to the register and pay.   Food: GET THE AL PASTOR!!! It's what they're known for. They top it off with a red salsa, a creamy green salsa (they call it 'guacamole'), and onions and cilantro. FYI the salsas have a kick! Luckily I didn't get any asada. It looked dry and my friend said it wasn't that good. They also have meat and fries, quesadillas, and I think mulitas.   Price: each taco is $2.95 which is kinda pricey for a small taco, buy hey it's Vegas and it tastes really good. A regular drink is $1.75 and that's including horchata and jamaica (it comes from a soda machine, but still good) and unlimited refills.   Service: nothing bad, nothing too great either.

The only bad thing is, it's really hard to come here during lunch time or after club hours because that's when it's the busiest.  Came here yesterday for a quick lunch, which turned into a rushed one. I was in line for the al pastor for about 30 minutes, & I only had an hour to eat. So I had to rush with eating just so I would have enough time to drive back to work.   Overall, their food and horchata are delicious! So it's worth it if you're not in much hurry",

It was so loud in there with one man butchering crane Assad that was full of fat...I couldn't hear the man asking me questions all the while he was behind the counter rolling his eyes at me. I understand people come in there drunk however all your patrons aren't drunk and I clearly wasn't. I wanted to throw the below average and expensive taco in his face. The place is cramped, dirty and the tacos are $2.00....in LA the most we pay for an incredible taco is $1.50.....I don't even pay that when I go to tacos Leo or chato. Some yelpers have nasty taste buds or something. Don't believe the hype for this place or earl of sandwich.....gross!!!!",

What a treat to find out this was right down the street from where we were staying.  If you're expecting fine dining, or even organization, this place is not for you. It's made for quick order, quick eats, in and out that simple. However, there is always a line out the door for good reason. Their tacos are amazing. Our first time there was after a bar crawl around 3am. Still a line out the door. It went pretty quickly, they have separate lines for their different meats (a pastor line, an asada line, etc.) they go pretty quick if the drunk guy in front of you doesn't forget what he wants to order. Tortillas are fresh, pastor right of the spit, and the traditional grilled onions and jalepenos on the side at your request. Also a salsa bar with all the fixings. Price is what you'd normally pay at any taco stand, and the flavor is amazing.  It was so good that the last day of our trip, we went back during the day as our last meal before hitting the road. This is a Vegas staple and now we know why.",

I've tried the el pastor taco and truthfully, it was overspiced, and the flavoring seemd off (in comparison to LA grub).  However, the service was quick and they get tacos flying out to customers within less than 3 seconds.  The one thing that sort of grossed me out was that because they were working so fast and so hard, the sweat was just flying all over the place.  Yes, sweat flying into the tacos and grills.

The meat is tender and juicy, the avocado sauce is creamy and full of flavor, and the salsa has a decent kick.  I've been here twice and I'm only giving it 4 stars because the food didn't seem as fresh the second time around for whatever reason. The meat was a little cold and the fries were a bit undercooked. Also, they were a bit stingy with the meat on the adobada fries and they went overboard on the cheese and sour cream. Regardless, if you visit Las Vegas, try to make time to hit this place up. It can get busy during peak hours, so keep that in mind if you're running a tight schedule. The first time I went, we probably spent a good 30-40 minutes standing in line just waiting to order.",

Tacos get 4 stars. place gets 3 stars at best. You should be able to order your tacos at one time and pay there. it would cut down the time in line significantly so you don't have to eat cold tacos. or pay and then give the tacos person your receipt. I'm a genius, I know.",

But it's worth it! There's separate lines for each type of meat you want so read that before standing in line. Wish they had chicken, but only beef and pork )= They ask you what you want and if you want all the toppings (cilantro, onions, avo sauce). You order, they give you the food, you walk to the back and pay. It's efficient. They'll put foil over it when u pay if you're doing to-go. There's a tented area in the front to sit and eat but it's crowded.   Since we went at night the heat inside wasn't too bad, but there is NO air conditioner. Just fans, so it's stuffy. Probably so bad during the day time in the summer. No water out or anything either, and drunk people and heat don't mix well.  Saw a drunk guy totally pass out and hit the floor waiting in line. Heard a big thump when his head hit :/ he got up with a huge bump on his head and they called an ambulance. Hope you're okay whoever you are! Too bad you didn't get to try the amazing tacos.",

The wait can get pretty long, but I don't mind waiting for food that I actually love. I don't mind paying 2.25 for a taco because it's vegas and if you're gonna complain about the prices then you might as well stay home and eat jack in the box tacos. The food was really great and very flavorful. These tacos are the closest you will get to TJ tacos! Amazing. There are different lines for everything, but it seems like they were going for the feel you get when you go to there TJ locations. The only thing I didn't like was the security guard letting certain people cut in front of everyone who was waiting in line. It is small in there but I don't think they realized how much people would love the food when they opened it! Overall it was worth the line",

If you wanted al pastor you went in one line and any other kind of meat you went to a separate line. My boyfriend and I both ordered 2 tacos de al pastor each and a small side of carne asada fries. The fries were not that great, that's why they are not getting the full 5 stars. They didn't have enough cheese and were mostly covered in their avocado sauce, and although it is good, I like my carne asada fries to be cheesy. Now the tacos were absolutely delicious! Fresh hand made tortillas, and the meat was delicious, I wish I had ordered more tacos and skipped the fries",

But workers seemed friendly enough once at the counter.  Unique ordering system - be prepared to wait in multiple lines depending on the type of food you want. Best to visit with 2 or three friends so each can get in a different line. Seating is adequate but generally the place is packed and you may have to wait to sit inside.",

The Tacos El Gordo's in SD are way better, I'm not sure why the quality control is so lacking here. I ordered 12 tacos and meats in each taco were sparse and the sauces/guac were super unevenly distributed (some tacos were drenched while others barely had anything on them). I'm paying over 2 dollars for each taco and I'm from LA where you can get amazing $1 tacos with more substance. Thoroughly unimpressed since I went out of my way to come here and loved the other stores I've been to. Also I asked for some chiles and was literally given one single chile, despite the fact that I bought 12 tacos. I asked for more (I was very polite) and the worker gave me insane attitude and gave me the smallest burnt chile. I will never come back to this location, it's a waste of money.",

Even down to the corn tortilla.   First you stand in line for different types of tacos. One line is for Adobada El Pastor (marinated pork on a trompo), Asada (Steak), Lengua, etc. I love that they only cut the meat where you order which makes the meat that much juicier and tender.   I got the adobada al pastor and asada and they were just too good. I could describe it but you just have to eat them for yourself. My friends only ordered two because it was late night, but after eating them, they went for two more. LOL. When you order adobada al pastor, make sure you ask for pineapples because it doesn't come by default. And pineapples make a big difference. And get the grilled jalapenos and green onions.   They usually have long lines but totally worth it.   I wish these guys would come up to Seattle. They would kill it here.",

So we decided to go Sat around 4 hoping the line wouldn't be that bad. Well, there was a line, but not as long. From the moment we arrived to the moment we sat (if you're lucky to get a table) was 1 hr and 15 mins. Was it worth the wait, kind of. The tacos are traditional street tacos which is great, the price is right at about $2.75 a taco, but by the time you get your food, pay and eat, your food is cold. Tacos still tasted good, but if they were piping hot, that would of been better. HEADS UP, they have designated lines for specific tacos, so if you want different cuts of meat, you will have to have two people stand in different lines or get into both lines at different times. The layout and way they have the lines set up is what causes the wait to be so long. They do make the tacos fresh when you order, but they do get cold quickly. Was it worth trying, yes, but maybe once only.",

It has a nice comfortable feel to it which is only made better by the amazingly friendly service that I have received every time I have gone in.   Everything I have tried has been excellent but the standout at this point has to be the taco de cabeza. I am a big fan of tacos and I can say that these are the best I have ever had. I have tried 4 or 5 different tacos which have also all been excellent. Tacos El Gordo is exactly what a small restaurant should be. Great service with great food.

Why do I hate this place?  - The employees just ignore you if you don't speak Spanish. - There are separate lines depending on the type of meat.  So if you want to sample different kinds of meat, you either have to wait in line multiple times or you have to coordinate waiting in line with your friends.  Good luck on getting your food at the same time.  By the time the last person gets their food, the first person's food will be cold. - they're very slow in getting their food out.  As much as I hate this place, I will admit that they make a tasty taco (though, I've certainly had better in San Diego and other places).",

    "text": "Simply put, the best street tacos in Las Vegas!  The minute you walk into this place you will notice it is insanely BUSY, and that most people are on the pork line-- because it is the best item on be menu. Don't get me wrong, steak is also tasty, but the pork is excellent on any menu item. Here is what I normally order.  Campechana fries, half order. These fries are smothered in steak or pork, cheese, cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and their special sauce... Virtually a food group of its own. Beware you can probably share your fries with three of your friends and still eat plenty.  Pork tacos: I get them with everything and a bit extra of their green sauce--a cilantro based sauce.  Mulitas on flour tortillas: there are topped with the same ingredients as the tacos but the ingredients are sandwiched between two flour tortillas with grilled, melted cheese on them. Amazing.  You can have a filling lunch for no more than $10 bucks. If show up during the lunch hour be ready to wait for about 15 minutes before getting your food.",

The pork is great as well, the sauce they put on for you is perfect, and the warm pineapple sliver tops off a great taco.  The Campechana fries (1/2 pork 1/2 steak) are a must, although they will put you to sleep within an hour of consuming.  The smoke flavor is very prominent in the meat when served on top of the fires, flirting with overwhelming.  Ate there 2 times in the same day, that should speak for itself.",

The way the natural juices glimmered and sparkled from the ceiling lights. It was love at first sight, I had dreams about that for nights to come.  The tacos are best enjoyed with some lime and salsa (green and red) with some of the thicker guacamole they have. Be warned that it will get messy as the tacos deliciousness will drip all over the place.  Honestly I would return to Vegas just for these tacos alone! Trick the nightclubs, the shows, the strip clubs, it's all about these tacos right here...",

There's no food warmer, microwave, anything on site. The food tasted great. I would go back in heartbeat.",

    "text": "Best tacos in Las Vegas hands down!!  You start by getting in line for whatever meat you want. They have a long list of options. You say which meat then you can either get everything on it (sour cream, salsa, cilantro, guacamole, and onions) or just what you want on it. Each taco was under 3$.  The second time we went I got carne asada fries. AMAZING! There were so much flavor and so much on them. I only ordered the small for about 8$ and I couldn't finish it. It's basically a taco on fries. The fries are topped with meat, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. You can choice to put salsa, cilantro or onions on it.   I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I am here to try out some authentic food as compared to the Americanized versions. It's around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and the place is packed. From the Spanish being spoken and menus that I have no idea what it means without some research, I'm guessing this is authentic.  I tried the following:  Adobada - spicy pork - boldest flavor on the four tacos I tried. It's on the salty side.  I didn't feel any spice while eating but tiny kick of spice in the after taste. This is probably their claim to fame. Since there is a big spool of it right by the front door outside spinning.  Carne Asada - grilled beef - guacamole dominated the initial taste. That's okay by me since I like guacamole.  As I continue, I can taste the meat. It tastes like smoked beef.  Suadero - brisket - this was very sour. Meat is softer. If eating too slow, it will stick to the wax paper. May be this is why it comes with two skins?   Azetca - beef and cactus - this one was bland, so ask for red sauce (mild spice) or green sauce (hotter spice) when you get to the counter. There are also lime available at the self service area by the drink fountain. The combination goes well together but eating the cactus alone doesn't taste good. Again, I like the guacamole on it. The cactus is a bit slippery and has some pickle texture when you eat it.  All four tacos, I can really taste the corn skin, whatever that's called.  Some suggestions, get a fork if you want to eat the stuff that falls out of the taco. I use the fork to reload the taco and clean up after I run out of skin. You won't need a fork if you are a taco master or can just stuff the whole taco in one bite. It seems to me the game is to see how few napkins you will use.   Try the fountain drink, it's very different from your typical fast food restaurant. They have the Bang and the Ole. The Bang has virgin Pina colada, whipped orange, etc. The Ole has this hibiscus flower drink, which was pretty tasty, but I don't know exactly what it is. I don't often see drinks made from flowers.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and the food was differently different and fairly tasty for my taste buds.",

In order to get al pastor or adobada you have to stand in one line and then go back to the other line to order any other type of meat. My al pastor resulted in being cold! Also I respect the cooks but they don't listen to you if you don't want a specific side on your tacos. I said no onions on some and only cilantro on others but was ignored because he wanted to put everything on and go since the lines are huge. Everybody was confused in line that I ended up getting my tray bumped and one of my sopes fell off my tray. The worker said you can wait back in line for another or just leave one so I left it and didn't pay for it. Seems to be a constant issue since I saw a lot of tacos on the floor too",

    "text": "Is this the best place in U.S. where you can get authentic, cheap, tasty tacos? No.   I do frequent this spot for cheap snacks between meals. The service - think fast food chain. You're pretty much order your food at different counters separated by variety and cuts of meat. Grab a tray, and within a minute you'll get your tacos on the tray then you proceed to another register to pay for your tacos and soda. I honestly not a fan of their al pastor tacos - despite the rave reviews, they were nothing special and I've had better al pastor across the country, even all the way in Philly! My favorites are the lengua (beef tongue) and cabeza (beef head), both cooked very well and very flavorful. If you prefer something lighter or clean flavor, get the asada (steak). I saw that the fries and sopes are also very popular choices in here but I rather save my appetite on the tacos. For the quality and flavor the price is a bit high, at roughly $2.50 per taco. If you're looking for the best tacos around the area - go to Monterey Park in Cali and visit one of the food trucks where the lady barely speak English, or head down to Arizona. Sadly, there ain't much decent taco places in Vegas.",

Order at the counter, some meats on the other side, Lengua Extra, bring to register, pay for food. It's just that simple.  Everything is pretty decent.  I will say, don't know if its the alcohol sh*ts, or the Tripa, but I had the runs in the morning. My friend says they don't wash the tripe properly... which could be the reason.

This is the perfect meal for any occasion even after a night of drinking. We also ordered their orchata which was very refreshing. Perfect touch of cinnamon and not too heavy.

The cooks were very kind and helpful, the only downside is how they have 3 different lines depending on what meat you want which makes everything chaotic and probably stressful for employees considering most customers looked confused on where to go... my experience with the rude chubby brunette cashier was terrible. I've never had someone ignore me like she did I do feel pity for her since she looks like she HATES her job. We had ordered 4 vampiros 14 tacos so I spent around 45-50 dollars ... This was around 2pm I went back to ask for some hot sauce since we love extra sauce and she decided to give me ONLY 2 lol i asked for some more kindly and she looked at me turned around gave the lady next to me 4 and just ignored me.. even the lady who received 4 looked at her but cashier didn't give a f**k and went on paying out other costumers .. I didn't wait a hour and a half and pay all that for someone's shitty attitude I wasn't giving her a hard time whatsoever I just simply asked for some sauce I felt pretty embarrassed since everyone in line saw I had to bite my tongue.

Good spicy al pastor, lots of flavor and the eight tacos were less than 20 bucks. What's not to like, decent amount of outdoor seating, tasty tacos at a good price. Perfect for an afternoon snack before dinner! Even better is that it's a two minute walk from our hotel.",

Drunk/tipsy + Mexican food should heaven but it unfortunately just didn't hit the spot. I mean sure, it was fine and I was pleasantly surprised they had adobada fries but the adobada tacos, which I adore normally, just didn't do it for me.   We got there around 3:30 (they close at 4am) and the lines were HUGE. Clearly everyone has the same desire for some tacos after leaving the clubs. Fortunately, they moved pretty fast and we got 2 tacos each ($2.25 per taco) plus fries coming out to ~$28. I believe the tacos are priced 30-40 cents higher, but it's the Strip. The adobada just didn't seem as flavorful but the fries tasted fantastic. They were like carne asada fries and had a good amount of sauce. Not sure what it was but my other two friends agreed that it just did not hold up to their SD locations.",

This place is right near the Wynn in a little strip mall.  Very casual.    Let's talk about the tacos.  Oh the tacos.  We ordered the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  The Carne Asada comes with the usual onions and cilantro.  Get the avocado sauce...on everything.  It is amazing.  The El Pastor was cut off of a huge stack of meat roasting on a spit.  Then it gets covered in a red sauce and the avocado sauce and topped with onions and cilantro.  Meat is tender and well seasoned.  AMAZING.    Yes, it's crowded, but that's a good sign.  If you have to sit on a curb, stand outside, or stand on your head to eat your food...do it.  The prices are great and you can get a drink with free refills.  Tacos El Gordo is truly a gem in an area where prices are ridiculously expensive, the price for one taco is about $2.   I ordered four tacos and had to go get another one even though I was full.  It's that good.     My recommendation?  Run, don't walk to Tacos El Gordo.  I would if I could.",

The food is cooked and chopped right in front of you and that is a breath of fresh air because its just really fresh and you just know the food isnt just sitting under a heat lamp for hours....but the three stars is because the food just didn't deliver all the hype it gets. Between the six of us we had the carne asada fries and tacos, the chorizo tacos, and quesadilla. The meat is kinda fatty so I found myself spitting out some of it. The chorizo was a bit sweet and I really like my chorizo spicy. The quesadilla was kind of a joke it was just one small  flour tortilla with some cheese and a super hard  tiny corn tortilla laid on top. The fries were decent but again there is a green sauce that they put over it and it was sweet too and just didnt compliment the food that well.   On another note though... all the employees were pretty nice and even though I thought I wasn't speaking loud enough they were very attentive and could hear me good and if they needed us to repeat anything, they were nice about and didnt get frustrated which was nice.",

Legitimately great tacos worthy of the long wait you'll certainly experience even when Omid wastes half of your day getting there.  They have separate lines depending on which meats you're planning to eat. If you're carne asada and al pastor, you'll be queuing hard. But if you're into more adventurist meats like tongue and head, you can jump straight to the front.",

    "text": "As a Mexican one of the first things to do is look for that place that reminds me of my beloved Mexico. So one of the first places I went since I moved here was Tacos El Gordo, since I tried this place in Tijuana without thinking I went here.  I'm from Sonora we are known for our Carne Asada Tacos, but Tijuana mostly because of the Al Pastor... so... I wasn't going to risk it to much I went for the Al Pastor and I DO LIKE THEM A LOT!   Carne Asada Tacos are a great fix, and I order always one of those and then go crazy with a bunch of Al Pastor (obviously can't compare them to my Sonoran traditional tacos).   I'm battling with my self about trying any other tacos(lengua,cabeza tripas, sesos,etc) I like it back home but here, may be one day.   But to resume I do recommend this place, try to avoid crowded times, usually around noon during the week and on weekend noon and probably around 5.   I give 5 stars base on Charleston location:  what I have had, also service is great, and place is clean!   SPANISH/ESPANOL:  Como Mexicana una de las primeras cosas que se busca es encontrar ese lugar que me hace recordar a mi querido Mexico. Asi que al mudarme a Las Vegas uno de los primeros lugares que visite fue Tacos el gordo, debido a que ya e probado los originales que estan en Tijuana B.C.   Yo soy de Sonora estado conocido por su deliciosos tacos de carne asada, pero Tijuana debo aceptar es mas conocido por sus tacos Al Pastor... asi que sin pensarlo mucho me fui y pedi un buen de Tacos Al Pastor Y ME ENCANTAN!   Los tacos de carne asada son buenos para salir del antojito, asi que normalmente mi orden es uno o dos de asada y un monton de Al Pastor (claro no se comparan con mi lindo sonora jaja)   Aun tengo la indecision si probar algo mas que estos dos tacos como son los de lengua, sesos, tripas, etc... en Mexico me gustan pero aqui, aun sigo indecisa.   Pero en resumen puedo decir que SI recomiendo este lugar, mi unico tip es trata de evitar las horas ocupadas por que vas a esperar un rato para poder comer, las cuales normalmente son a medio dia entre semana y los fines de semana medio dia y si no me equivoco despues de las 5 tambien.   Le doy 5 estrellas en base a la sucursal Charleston: tambien a lo que yo e probado, tambien a que el servicio es muy bueno y el lugar es limpio.",

    "text": "I've been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, and to this day, I'm still convinced they lace their tacos with some sort of euphoric drug. These are my favorite tacos in the world (well, except for actual Mexico) and I'm glad they lived up to the standard I was accustomed to in San Diego.  My friend and I came here on a chilly Las Vegas evening after a long two-day meeting at SLS Station. The lines were pretty long when we arrived, and everyone is forced to step inside the restaurant so the doors can close. It's security-enforced.  While I snagged a table for the two of us inside, my friend stood in line for al pastor tacos. Usually in San Diego, I'd have the flexibility to stand in multiple lines to get a variety of tacos, but it seemed ridiculous with a 15 minute wait in each line.  People came and went quickly, but I stood my ground at our table, knowing it could be a full house at any time. They ran out of al pastor at the station my friend was at, but they weren't able to \"restock\" from the other al pastor station, so she had to wait an extra 15 minutes. Never waited this long for tacos before, but I knew it would be worth it in the end.  Eventually my friend showed up with our tray of tacos and my cup of horchata. I was in heaven. All the trouble and the wait was well-weathered. Tacos El Gordo still gets 5 stars for its food. I've seen that they have less busy nights, so our visit was probably just poorly timed. Seems like a bunch of locals and families come here, but if you have the flexibility and you're visiting, check it out.",

That should be enough for you to read to go straight there, but if it isn't...  Food:  Tacos are OMG good.  There are like 10 different kinds you can get.  The two of us got Lengua, Tripe, Pork (not pastor they were out the other one), Steak, Cabeza (cheek meat).  Wife thought the Cabeza was a little greasy, but it is supposed to be that way with the high fat content.  Tripe blew both of us away and may have been best of show.  Didn't taste like tripe, not sure how you get char on tripe but they did and yet it was super tender.  Unreal in a good way.  Lengua was super tender and amazing. Pork was spicy and delightful.  Steak had a ton of smoke and grilled flavor.  Price:  We got 7 tacos and two fountain drinks.  We were stuffed.  It was $18 total.  Where in the hell else are you going to get anything close to that on the strip?  Best place to have Lunch in Vegas in my opinion.",

After entering I go to the far left line which leads me to Tacos al Pastor happiness. Watching the highly talented and efficient guy cutting meat off the rotisserie is worthy of tossing a couple bucks in the tip bowl, which he always acknowledges and thanks me for.  Only thing is don't come in here drunk, slow or stupid. This place means business, especially when they're busy. Kind of like the soup nazi in Seinfeld - be ready to order by the time you're at the counter. They don't have time to hold your hand and help you think through your options.  After ordering you receive your food and then have to walk over to another counter to pay and add drinks if you want. I always get an orchata with my meal.",

Somewhere along the chewing, a relatively large piece of the bread got stock in my throat and it wouldn't detach, making me gag.  I had to run to the bathroom and spit everything in my mouth to save myself. I am not exaggerating. My throat and chest still hurts from all the scratching that piece if bread did to it.",

My go-to order is the adobada tacos and adobada mulas. As you can tell, the adobada is mmmMMMmmMmm.... there's other meat options as well, but if you don't get the adobada here, then you just stood in the long line for nothing. Keep in mind once you're done with that long wrap-around line on the outside, there are separate lines in the inside that are divided based on what meat you're purchasing.

Anyways, Tacos El Gordo is situated right by a parking lot, so you can come and park here, no problem. But both times that I came here (same weekend lol), my friends and I walked because it's walking distance from the center of the strip (TI, Bellagio, planet hollywood, etc), and it's right by XS nightclub!!  Get the lengua (tongue) and the adobada (pork) for sure. I tried a few others that were good, but don't remember what they were lol. I believe cash only. Also, they are way stingy with the sauces -- I think they only give 2 per person or something. Have 2-3 people pay for the tacos if that means you can get more sauces..",

The lines can get really long and you have to know exactly what you want beforehand. You wait in line for the type of meat you want. For example, if you want asada fries you have to wait in the asada line. If you want asada tacos too you need to tell them when you order the fries otherwise you'll have to go to the back of the line! There are pretty much two different lines. One line is for asada, mules, sopes, and chorizo whereas the other one is for adobada and al pastor. Plan ahead!   The carne asada fries are not that great here. It's not hot enough and the sauces added on top are cold which makes for a weird combination. Maybe the adobada fries are better.",

No wonder there are always long lines, but definitely worth the wait.   They have different lines for different things so make sure you read the sign and get in the right line! If you want multiple things, I recommend coming here with friends and have each person go into different lines .   The service is so fast and efficient here. I love that they make their own tortillas, it just doesn't get more better and authentic than that. Definitely get some al pastor and carne asada tacos. So tender and perfectly seasoned. The tacos come with some guac and you can ask for some grilled pineapples on top too.   There is a station where you can get your jalapenos and carrots. Once you've gotten everything, just head to the cashier to pay. They provide the red and green verde sauces.   There is a sit in and dine area but keep in mind, this place gets super crowded so good luck finding a table.   Parking is pretty limited in their lot.   Miss these tacos already. If these tacos are amazing sober, best believe they're even more amazing after a night of downing shots. Can't wait to go back!",

The lines. So, you must go with a group to divide and conquer if you want different tacos because you're screwed if you're by yourself and you want one el pastor, one lengua, and one carne asada taco. Sorry, bud, you gotta stand in three separate lines. And then a 4th line to pay for the tacos. UNLESS you tip the dude you're with IN HOPES (no guarantee) that he grabs those other tacos for you even though you're in the carne asada line.   Seating can be tricky, too. The turn around for a table can be quick but you're fighting others for one, too. Think Costco during prime time lunch hour. Haha  All in all, I'd definitely come back to this place!!! #mindBlown",

I do it for the love and appreciation of Mexican taco shop culture and these professional meat slicers, Taco makers and food preparers! Plus, I find that i receive great hospitality when i put in this little effort. The menu is simple and the best part is they have TWO lines for al pastor/adobada, so kindly ask the security guard if you can step in the usually shorter adobada line if it's open.",

    "text": "It pains me a little to write this review. Ever since I was little, Mexican food has always been my favorite thing to eat. As a result, I'm always on the hunt for the best tacos and burritos wherever I go. Tacos el Gordo had been on my all-time bucket list of Mexican food; over the years, it has built up quite a reputation of authenticity and deliciousness. Specifically, I was very excited to try their famed tacos de adobada, which contain spiced pork marinated with pineapple and cooked on a rotating spit. Unfortunately, I don't think the experience here was worthy of the hype.  First off, the entry and ordering system is extremely flawed and disorganized. You begin by waiting in a preliminary line outside the front doors for about 30-40 minutes. When you reach the end of that, you are quickly ushered in by the woman guarding the front, who shouts in Spanish to direct customers to even more lines in front of the food counter (luckily, I am able to speak Spanish, but the group ahead of me was completely lost, and no one tried to help them). Supposedly, you have to enter multiple lines to order the different types of meats -- I wanted to try the adobada, carne asada, lengua (beef tongue), cabeza (beef head meat), and suadero (brisket), so I had to get in three or four different lines just to order everything I wanted. To make matters worse, the lines didn't even follow the guiding overhead signs, so people just ended up trying to push their way to the counter to put their order in. It took me well over an hour and a half just to get all my food together.  As for the tacos themselves... I definitely can't say that they were bad, but by the same token I can't say I was overly impressed, either. The adobada was ok, but honestly reminded me a little of Chinese pork. The carne asada was decent, but the suadero and cabeza were pretty forgettable. I will say that the lengua taco I ordered ranks up there with some of the better lengua that I have tried, but one would expect more than one good taco out of five from such a well-regarded institution.  Overall, some decent tacos to be had here, but not quite the world-class experience that I'd come to expect. And that line system needs to be fixed, pronto.",

If you haven't tried crispy intestines, you need to try one TODAY BECAUSE IT IS A GAME CHANGER TACO. The al pastor was juicy and savory as always, which was the perfect compliment to the fresh and chewy corn tortillas. Finally, their cilantro and chopped raw onion mixed perfectly with their flavorful blend of salsas to top off these individual delicious tacos. TO DIE FOR!!! The crispy tripas are fried golden morsels of meaty intestine that explode with a rich and deep flavor when placed in a taco!! Must!! Try!!!",

Once you decide what meat you want, you walk up to the counter/ grill and place your order. In addition to the tacos being made to order, the tortillas are also made fresh.  We ordered and loved : asada tacos, chorizo tacos and asada quesadillas. These tacos are delicious and authentic! I'd highly recommend dining here if you're in the area!",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo has the best tacos in Las Vegas, no questions asked. If you're starving, be prepared for a wait because there seems to be a line at all hours. We came around 8P, and while the line stretched out the door. We were able to order within 30 minutes. You're better off coming with a group. Orders are taken by meat type. You can split a variety of orders amongst a group for the best experience.   The 9 of us tried Carne Asada (steak), Adobaba (spicy pork), Lengua (beef tongue), Chorizos (pork sausage), and Al Pastor (pork). My personal favorites might have been the carne asada and adobada. All in all, everything was fantastic. They cut the meat on the spot, so you should only expect the freshest ingredients. No cheese here. What you get is delicious salsa and guacamole toppings. Ask for the peppers on the side. They use both corn and flour tortillas, but corn is the way to go. The tacos are pretty small. We each put away 5 tacos, but we could have gone for more. Given the line, considering order as much as you can gorge on.  The line seemed intimidating at first, but it moved quite swiftly. Again, orders are taken by meat type, so if you're in a line for beef, you can only get beef types. Come with a group and plan to break up your orders for the best feasting experience. The prices are very cheap (less than $3 per taco). The seating situation can be a bit difficult, but they have seats inside and outside. Tacos El Gordo has some of the best tacos I've ever eaten, and it was all at a reasonable price. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Tacos El Gordo takes the crown for being one of the best taco joints to ever hit the streets of Las Vegas, handsdown. Great place to eat with a big group or even go with a friend/significant other. Whatever the occasion, Tacos El Gordo sounds good to me! Orders are taken by meat type, so make sure you plan on splitting up with your group and get in line for whatever kind you're craving.   My group tried Carne Asada (steak), Lengua (beef tongue), Adobada (spicy pork) and Al Pastor (pork). My personal favorite was the Adobaba, but all in all everything was flavorful and the meats were cooked to perfection, all juicy and tender to eat. Everything is fresh to made, you watch the cooks cutting the meat and putting the taco together right in front of you. You get delicious salsa with some guacamole toppings and pineapple on each taco. Not only is the food incredibly amazing, but the staff is so helpful and so sweet! I asked for some more pineapple slices from one of the cooks, and he stacked some onto a plate for me. Definitely try this place if you're in the Las Vegas area, because I know I'm coming to this place again!",

I came here multiple times on my short trip to Vegas last month and I'm still thinking and dreaming of their Al Pastor tacos.... yummmmmm. They offer different meats and options but I say stick with the simple tacos and try the lengua if you aren't scared of it. I thought it was very tasty with their salsa verde. The al pastor was served with an avocado crema that just made it even better! Seeing them prep and make your order fresh (even slicing the meats off the rotator) made this dining experience so much better! I love that its cheaper and quick too. Perfect for a quick pit stop while exploring Vegas. Highly, highly recommend to anyone in search of tacos in the area!",

One of the Lyft drivers mentioned this place to me and advised me of it's popularity, great food, and long wait times.  Now I  love Mexican food, but I was not trying to wait an hour for anything but my curiosity got the best of me and I ended up in line, in the heat, for about an hour.  Apparently, lines are an everyday thing here as the staff was passing out cups of water.  Once, I finally got in I ordered exactly what my Lyft driver told me to order, the mulas and a taco.  I guess it was worth the wait because it was delicious and different but goodness it was just so hot I know I wouldn't do it again but glad I was able to experience something I've never tried before.",

My parents and friend had been here before and enjoyed it quite a bit, so they were stoked it was open. The location is very convenient on the Strip right across the street from the old Stardust.  The tacos al pastor were delicious, and for $2.10 each, they're a little higher than other taquerias, but much less than a full-service restaurant. There are different stations at the counter that you go up to based on what's type of meat you want - everything from carne asada and al pastor to sesos, lengua, and cabeza.  I appreciated the plate of cebollitas (grilled green onions) and grilled peppers that came with the food. And there was a station to grab as Many radishes and lime wedges that you want! I don't often see Orange Bang in many places nowadays, so we were stoked to get some here.",

    "text": "Nearly 500-reviews and a 4.5/5.0 review on YELP for cheap tacos in Vegas? I \"had\" to try this spot on my last Vegas excursion.  ========= LOCATION =========  It's located at \"the edge\" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.  Anyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.  Also adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).  ========= THE FOOD =========  ~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5/5)  ~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4/5)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oCNAyy80KNhlFskH_cio4A&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  ~ MULAS - I \"think\" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4/5)  ~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3/5)  ~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal \"quesadillas.\" They are a large taco w/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat / toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1/5)  ========= AND SO..... =========  It was a good spot.  Definitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had.   As a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.  I will be back...",

Best taco and quesadilla I've ever had! Very fresh and flavorful. We even ordered to-go for later late night munchies.  Fast service and inexpensive. You order first and then go to the cashier to pay.",

We tried Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Adobado, Choirzo and Lengua and our favs were by far the Carne Asada and Adobado (spicy marinated roast pork). Fortunately for those who love the Adobado, the lines are usually quite short. Don't forget to ask for the roasted pineapple on the Adobado. You will also see some getting the Chiles y Cebollas de la Plancha (grilled peppers and onions) which I thought looked so good but really weren't. I would pass. Horchata was not fresh, comes from a Coke machine, but it was still really good. Lengua was very good actually, just didn't have the layers of flavors that the Asada and Adobado had.   Really packed late at night. Lines aren't so long during the middle of the day. Come here!",

We came back the next day for lunch. My husband and I shared the carne Asada fries, which is big enough for 2 or more to share. It was really good. He stated the fries were salty but I didn't notice. I also got 2 tacos de carne Asada that were good. My husband for 1 taco de lengua and 1 buche, he stated that both were good. We also got an horchara that was not bad. In the side you could order grilled onions and chiles which was great. They also have lime and radishes. The food was great. I would definitely come again and tell people that I know about this place. I wish we had a place like this in Northern California.",

It's really interesting inside the place because they have separate lines for everything. I guess it makes sense since they're so popular! But that means that you have to stand in line multiple times if you want different types of tacos/fries. The asada (beef steak) line was the longest (went straight out the door and started going against the side of the building) and the adobada was the shortest. Almost no line for the cashier, though! It does get really crowded in there and there are no designated exit doors, so be careful not to drop the food you waited ~15 minutes for!",

The one thing that threw me off here was that there were so many lines for different things. Whoever organized this.. didn't organize this. Theres a line for Asada. Theres a line for Abodaba. Theres a line for fries. Theres a line for beef tongue/tripe/shoulder. And... once you thought that was all done theres a line for the cashier.

The asada taco was really dry, lengua was okay, and the adobada was juicy, but lacked flavor.  Carne asada fries were super greasy and mostly had fat pieces in there.  Horchata was sweet and is made from syrup - so it's not homemade, but I enjoyed their free refills!  Their salsas were watered down, so that was also a fail.

After a great concert my hunger was high, and a yelp search happen to come across a taco spot on the strip that seemed letigimate and authentic.....  Grab a taxi and request Tacos El Gordo. Right at the tip end of the strip on this strip mall location (across from a walgreens) we reached our destination I open the door and the whiff Mexico tacos! You know the ones you would smell when you'd go across the border before all the violence?! Yes! Those!   The BF and I ordered:       -a carne asada Mulita (it's like two tortilla's with melted cheese, guacamole, steak pieces, cilantro, onions, hot sauce)      -Two carne asada tacos (beef steak tacos)      -Two lengua tacos (tongue): super good, just the way lengua should be, be cautious of the green hot sauce which is flavorful but spicy!       -El Vampiro (this was similar to the \"mulita\" but the tortilla crispy/burnt like and I don't think it had melted cheese)  The tortillas are freshly made so the taste is delicious. Warm, not tough, soft tortillas.... Also note the tortillas are small.  It is very small on the inside but have more seating available on the outside.   You come out with a happy filled belly and your long locks smelling like tacos.... Oh yeah and its extremely affordable.   Hidden gem on the strip of Vegas when in search of good cheap food! I will definetely be coming back!",

The spicy pork name comes from the spices that it is marinated in rather than a hot spicy marinate. I will be back whenever I come to town.",

We parked close to the foot spa and the owner came out and told us too move. We walked in and there was a line. This made us even more excited. Seeing the al pastor    And the pineapple was love at first sight. The cooks were working hard and really nice. They were very attentive and taking care of all the customers. The tacos looked amazing. While I went to pay my husband told me the ladies who are cleaning yelled at them. Apparently, you can not hold nor sit in a table without food. The cashiers have so much cockiness and very rude. We finally sat down ate the tacos. Al pastor are amazing. Chorizo are even tastier. My kids loved the carne asada. If you come please note not to park in front of the business's. Food is amazing. Take it to go or eat outside. Don't mind the rude cashiers. Cooks are amazing. Enjoy.",

FYI me and my gf was the only Asian in fact I think the only non mexicans there.  I couldn't really understand what they were telling me but I just said yes to whatever.  They have 3 stations and you just kind of tell them what you want. Portions are small but cheap so you just orders a bunch. The Mexican version of dim sum I guess. The place is open late but can look pretty intimidating if you during the late hours",

Over 700 ratings averaging 4.5 stars, I thought it had to be mind blowing.. but not exactly. We had the spicy pork tacos and carne asada tacos. The guac was very bland. The service was really bad, too. We ordered and stood there forever, finally getting our carne asada tacos. They must have completely forgotten about the pork tacos, but after reminding them we eventually got them. It wasn't even crowded, either. It was a bummer to discover the horchata was out of service, too. I wouldn't go back here--but that's because I can get better authentic Mexican in my hometown. I guess I can see how those who don't have access to these type of places would love it. It's definitely authentic.. just not that great.",

I found this spot on Yelp because I was looking for a late night eatery that won't cost me an arm and a leg in Vegas.  Yes, Tacos El Gordo fit the \"affordable\" bill, but I just wish they had signs for each line that was semi-forming inside the restaurant.  The tacos were certainly legit -- they had the typical carne asada and steak, but also served innards like stomach and tripe and brains and tongue.  The servers were friendly and fairly quick.  I enjoyed the tongue taco the most.  I'll probably be back but not during their peak hours, which is anytime between midnight and 4:00 am.",

Maybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.  Spicy pork taco next.  No fat but no flavor either.    So yeah it was only $20 for me and my husband to \"eat\" but neither one of us actually got to swallow any of it.  Have not had this horrible of a restaurant experience in years.  I'm left wondering, did I truly go on an off day or do regular folk just love fat filled tacos?  I'm certainly not putting out another $20 to get an answer to that one.",

I've never wanted to know how to speak Spanish so badly in my life...yet my bilingual skills are no bueno.   So anyways, how did we end up here for lunch with our four kids? I'll tell you how. I walked by this place multiple times, to and from our hotel. I stopped one night and looked at the menu. I was tempted to go inside and order, but I didn't. Anytime of day that I walked by there, there was always people there. It could be 11AM or 11PM, always a line. That's another good indicator of good food.   Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there.   It's pretty good food, I enjoyed the tacos I had. My kids were satisfied with their food too. I mean, you can't really complain, $30 for six people's lunches...one of the better deals on the strip. I'd visit here again, these tacos sure beat Jack In the Box tacos after you've partied a little too hard, haha.",

    "text": "I don't normally write reviews, but I felt I had to so that no one else will waste their time and money here.   Quite possibly the worst taco place I have ever eaten. First of all, you have to stand in a specific line depending on what kind of meat you want. So if I stand in the Carne Asada line for ten minutes then have to stand in the Adobada line for another ten minutes, my Carne tacos are now twenty minutes cold. God forbid if I want lengua. That's thirty minutes. Then I have to stand in line to pay. Wtf. Who the hell thought of this stupid idea?  Now for the food. Eew. The cook put the non-marinaded Carne Asada on the grill with wood charcoal as the heating source. Not even salted or seasoned. And who cooks Carne Asada over a wood burning grill? This meat had more smoke flavor then a bbq joint. And I love wood smoked  bbq. I have never in my life had street tacos with this flavor. So gross we couldn't finish our food.   The Adobada (their version of Pastor) was flavorless as well. They don't even have a salsa bar. I asked for red salsa on the side and the lady, who was standing less than two feet from the container of red salsa said I had to ask the guy making the Adobada tacos. I stood there for a few minutes as he was too busy and decided F this place.   It is completely mind boggling how many people like this place, but it was gross. These people obviously never had King Taco before like back home in Southern California. Put a King Taco across the street from this place and you will see people switching over.",

But basically, there are different lines for different types of meats. It's probably easiest to get friends to stand in each line to get different types of tacos.  I got the carne asada fries ($5 for small portion, $10 for large portion) for which there was no line at all (it's off to the side). I was craving fries hahaha. The rest of my friends got different types of tacos. For the fries themselves were alright, but the toppings were amazing. I would definitely try the fries with adobada (spicy pork) the next time I go and grab a few tacos.",

We took this as a sign and ordered a bunch. My favorite thing was the carne asada fries. It's a large container of fries with carne asada, sour cream, guacamole/spicy green and cheese. We also go the pastor and lengua tacos. My husband really enjoyed his tacos. They were tasty but with the fries, the quality of the asada meat starts to show itself. I couldn't handle eating too much of it. It was fatty and tasted low quality. Again, people without meat phobias were really enjoying this place. My husband did say that the lingua was the best he has ever had.  Tip for newcomers: go to the window/bar/ordering area and order. When you get your tacos, go pay at the counter and they will provide you with a cup for a drink. Then you can sit down. This was a very confusing process... probably shouldn't have been but you know how it is in a new place.",

When I arrived I was absolutely starving.  I was shocked and disappointed.  The meat tasted like leather and had no flavor, very unfortunate.  Maybe they had a bad day and I'll give them another chance someday.  Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised",

Let me start by saying I'm a local and I've heard so many great things about Tacos El Gordo from others that I told my wife we had to swing by when we were downtown. We went around 12pm so prime lunch hour and had no issues finding parking which was awesome. Walking in we found there was a long line but it sure did move very fast! So you order your food and they hand it to you, almost like a school cafeteria style, and then you walk your plates over to the cashier for payment, soda purchases, and salsa. For three carne asada tacos, one carne asada sope, and a drink I only paid $14. The tacos come with a red salsa, guacamole, cilantro, and onion. The tortillas were almost brown instead of white or off white color, I'm assuming from not changing the oil regularly. The tacos themselves were very underwhelming. The meat was cold and all of the ingredients lacked seasoning. Just very blah... Sucks because I really did want to like it!",

The food is pretty good and location is conveniently located right next to Encore/Wynn. I guess it's also a bonus that they're open late and on Las Vegas Blvd, but I think there are better places to get tacos than here. The flavor of their al pastor isn't bad but not great, and you have to request the pineapple (other places put it on without asking). Their fries are just ok too. If you're on the strip and you have that craving for tacos, this place can definitely satisfy those cravings.",

We went to go ask if we could switch the asada mulita that we had for another one, and they denied our request. We were stuck with an extra mulita that we paid for, and no one had even touched and we had to throw it away cuz of how salty it was.   The ladies who were cleaning tables also made us feel rushed.

The meat is perfectly seasoned and their guac is the bomb.  I'm literally drooling as I write this review!  These tacos look small so it takes about three to get a normal sized person full.

My foodie friend took me here after XS last weekend along with a group of my girlfriends. He took good care of us and ordered here about 20 Taco De Adobada. It was delicious! And I was sober by then so I can vouch it's also good without the intoxication. :) It had a green sauce and plenty of meat. Worth every $2 my friend paid.  You really just have to come here and try it out. Though there were a lot of club goers at the time we went, the line moved ridiculously fast because service was quick. We sat outside in the patio.

    "text": "It's 3am on the Las Vegas strip. You're tipsy from all the free booze. Stumbling down the boulevard, you squint and make out a sign over a busy store front. Tacos El Gordo appears. It's chaos inside with a security guard out front. Hmm, why do they need a uniformed security guard for the entrance? Which line do you get in? No one's saying where to go and the alcohol causes some indecision. You read a sign for the adobada (al pastor) line. Lucky choice but you've been winning at blackjack lately and your streak continues with food. While waiting in line, you ponder what the old mafiosos would think about their little playground in the desert, if they saw and smelled the tasty meats.  The price is right for the little flavorful tacos. If it were Mexico, they'd be super cheap, like $0.50, but it's Vegas at 3am. There are different lines for different taco meats. Adobada  (al pastor) tacos and fries are the best. I tried the others (asada, cabeza, chorizo, buche, sesos, tripa, and lengua). All are good. But the adobada stands out. They slice off pieces of seasoned goodness, like those middle eastern shish kabob/gyro places, into a couple of small steamed corn tortilla soft shells. The tacos are around $2.20 a piece. They are about 3 savory bites full and well worth the money, considering I was staying at the Palazzo, $25 minimum for something decent to eat at this time of night at the Grand Luxe Cafe (also very good). The setup inside is strange and a bit of an honor system for payment. It's cheap, busy, tasty, and a great value with guacamole and salsa. Grab it to go. It's great to prevent a hangover. Maybe it's 3 or 4 stars in the daytime but it's absolute street taco heaven in the late night/early morning twilight of the neon strip before the long island iced tea hangover arrives. Rock on El Gordo!",

    "text": "The food is decent, nothing special really just your run-of-the-mill taqueria (nothing wrong with that though, I love these kinda places).    The lines are very very long(goes around the restaurant) and you can only order certain meats at each window.  For example. If you wanted a certain number of Al Pastor and a certain number of Asada tacos than you'd have to get in line at separate windows to order.  So if you and your group wanted different meats you'd have to know in advance how many of \"these\" and how many of \"those\" and how many of  \"that\" tacos in total that you want, than split up and order separately.  It's really really hectic inside so our order actually came incorrect but we just let it go since it would have taken just as long to get it fixed.  It took maybe 10 minutes standing near the window just to ask for some red sauce.  After you get your food you actually get in another line to pay, kinda like cafeteria style.  Here's the problem.  By the time you pay for your food and find a place to sit, your foods cold.  Tacos don't stay hot for long.  Again, the place is packed so there's a good chance you won't find a place to sit either.    Again, the food is okay(albeit under seasoned) but I just don't get the hype and lines.  It wouldn't be as bad if they had a better ordering/paying system in place.  I know I'm not the only CA native that's been here but I still see high-marks from my fellow CAlifornians.   I'm thinking this place is either the only taco place in town or because everyone's just drunk from a night on the Strip(I get that) or you're from a place where the only existing \"Taco\" is followed by a \"Bell\"(or preceded by a Del, but I do love Del Taco though).  There are just a ton of better taco places back home with zero hassle.  Would not come back and go through all the hassle.",

    "text": "Best tacos EVER.  Came here when we arrived around 1am.  Our hotel was right around the corner of the strip mall Tacos El Gordo is located in.  We were worried about the late night crowd, but were hoping they wouldn't be showing up until later.  We get there and there were 4 short lines.  The lines on the right side were shorter than the left.  There are separate lines depending which type of meat you want.  Since there were 3 of us, we split up to get our tacos faster.  Unfortunately, they ran out of the beef tongue :(.  The Al Pastor - spicy pork tacos were my favorite, and not far behind them were the chorizo.  The Asada tacos were delicious, but the beef was too overcooked for me.  I was in the Asada line, so I saw the guy assembling all of our tacos.  He was speedy and made no mistakes.  It was quite impressive.  My biggest concern was if he was going to change his gloves when he threw raw meat on the grill, and HE DID! Thank goodness.  The corn tortillas are phenomenal and so fresh.  You can see the woman tossing them on the griddle as the cook is making your tacos.  The tacos are small in size, but are packed with so many amazing flavors.  The price is good, it just keeps you wanting more.  I could probably eat these every day.  I wanted to have them again in the morning, but had to save room for the buffet we were headed to :(. Oh well, next time. I'll definitely be coming back just for these tacos.",

I had been seeing pics of their \"orange bang\" drink on Instagram so wanted to come here to taste it for myself...hoping that it's like a drink back home in Hawaii.  Came here one Friday after Tao. Got my fave tripas tacos and their orange bang. My drunk friends got a plethora of tacos and carne asada fries. Omg --- SO GOOD! Orange band included; it wasn't as frothy and creamy (more watered down) than I would like but, it'll do.  In fact, El Gordo was SO GOOD that we came here the next night after The Bank. lol This time, we decided to change up the meat and had TRIPAS FRIES ---- oooOOooooOOOooooooooohhhhhhHHhhhhhh. Talk about LIFE CHANGER right there!  It's pretty busy with the afterhours crowd with long lines but, the wait to order and to get your food isn't bad at all. Note: there are THREE lines in there. Each for different kinds of meats. Make it easier on yourself and have each of your friends (if you have more than 3) stand in each line to order things.  Honestly, felt sick to my stomach with all the bad food I ate that weekend (including El Gordo); but, I'd effing do that again!   If imma have a heart attack after that food; at least, I know I died a happy woman =)",

I love the concept of having some sides to add on (they had turnips, lime, etc). I had beef, chicken, and I even tried the beef tongue and they were all delicious! This is the best taco place I've ever had and you know they are legit when the actual workers are Mexican! I love how the meat is in front of you when you order and they cut it in front of you. They make their own  taco shells and their meat are always freshly cooked.  Very impressed with the food. And the servers are great and fast. This is a self serve place so you go out to the patio and eat it outside. You also clean up after yourself. Perfect for quick snacks at late hours (definitely a go to place after night of drunkenness and clubbing).",

    "text": "I must rate this place one star because of the service, the tacos are good, but I recommend the Mula over the tacos.  The reason for the low score is the service. There are 5 lines, ONE LINE FOR EACH MEAT option, that upset me big time. We were in a line expecting to be able to order any meat, but were sorely mistaken. After waiting 20 minutes to get to the front of the line, we asked for 4 asada tacos. The attendant said \"sorry. The line for asada is 2 lines down\". We were like WTF!!! He then said \"you are in the adobada line\". ***how does that make any sense????***  therefore you need to get in one line for asada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for adobada and then let those tacos get cold as you get into another line for tripas. WTF!!!  How does this make any sense?  Oh and did I mention it took us 20 minutes to get to the front of the adobada line (which was the shortest of all 5).   If you want to go to this place you need to take the amount of people with you with the amount of different meats that you want. Example: you want two meats take 2 people. One person stands in asada line and the other in adobada line and you order each other's tacos. Do not take kids because it is packed and it is a True cluster. You can't expect kids to be patient as you try to stand in each line to order a different meat.  Like I said. Food is good, but honestly not soooo good that it is worth dealing with the crouds and multiple lines and confusion.  That is just my opinion but I always recommend you find out your own experiences. Good luck.  Will my husband and I go back \"HECK NO!!!\"",

    "text": "Good but not oh my god unbelievable as you might think from these reviews. Solid set of tacos.   Surprised that al pastor does beat carne asada though. Ordering is also super simple and makes a ton of sense once you go. I was there when there was no line and thought damn I've got no chance. The guys behind the counter made it super easy - what do you want, how many and what on it? Since they are doing the cooking and serving, the \"line per\" makes total sense. Pickup, go to next line and order there, take tray to get limes/radishes, pay, get drink and eat. Simple.   Unlike most places though there doesn't seem to be a variety of different salsas that you can get and put on the tacos. I got \"everything\" on mine and would say the salsa provided was very mild. Not sure if there is a way to get spicy and there is no self service option for the salsas. No chips, cilantro, pickled carrots or other condiments which make me rate this four stars. Good stuff but with no spice I missed a kick. That said next time I'm at the Encore I'm making another stop. It's literally right there and worth the walk!",

Came with guacamole, too...for $2 each. They had a bar with radishes.  Only complaint is that I'd love to see a salsa bar.  At $2 a pop, I can't complain. They had plenty of seating outdoors. Super yummy and will be on my must do list from here on out.",

    "text": "This is the Northern branch of TEG de Tijuana, B.C.  I caught the Strip bus up from my convention at The Sands for lunch, and was glad I came!  TEG is just past the edge of  'Turisto Vegas' and firmly planted in the 'Residents' Vega's (all the surrounding store-fronts seem to Hispanic, or Korean, or Lebanese- oriented.)  If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4\" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)  Skip the flan, which is the standard Industrial article, a thick gluey disc that is squirted into those little plastic cups.   After eating, it is a short walk back South to the Wynn Hotel complex, where you can enjoy wandering around the waterfall park complex, and watching all the rich folks do their thang before heading back to the heart of the Strip.",

It has good parking and really isn't that hard to find once you know to drive, and it was well worth it.   The tacos are not big, but they pack more authentic flavor than any Mexican restaurant I have been to so far. I got two taco adobadas, a taco tripa, and a taco asada. They had some good horchata in a fountain with some soda as well.   Needless to say I am impressed. Two dollars a taco. Super quick, friendly people, clean but fun tidy environment, and incredible food. Only drawback was walking back outside into the 100 degree heat.   If you visit Vegas, you must stop by Tacos el Gordo!",

    "text": "Not bad at all for a little taco spot on the strip.  A couple friends recommended this place so we went.  It was easy to find and everything was easy about this place. We walked in and there are menus in front of you before you walk in and when you walk in.  Here's how you do it. You walk up to the counter, I'd go to the left counter because everyone goes to the first counter they see when they walk in (creates a cluster-f*ck). Once you see the Al Pastor (spicy pork) spinning with that chunk of pineapple on the top and bottom, your mouth should start watering. I ordered 2 carne asada (steak) tacos, hubby ordered 1 carne asada taco and one Al Pastor tostada. They put all the condiments on for you so if you are a condiment nazi (like one of my friends) make sure you ask for it on the side. I wanted it the way it came, with everything on it. As soon as you get your food take it to the cashier, order any drinks you may want, and pay. I couldn't resist the orange and pineapple bang!! As soon as we sat down I scarfed down my tacos like nothing, they were pretty good, Zeke loved the Al Pastor, it's his favorite and he said it was really good. Be sure to ask for napkins from the cashier because that is the only place you'll find them. There are no napkins to grab anywhere else, just from the cashier. Also, if you need to use the restroom you have to ask for the key from the cashier. I stood by the restroom waiting for someone to come out like a geek for a while until an employee told me to get the key. Doh!  Anyways, if you're looking for some good street tacos to satisfy your late night munchies, to sober up, or cuz you're hungry for some... I'd say come to this place.",

Sometimes this place gets really crowded, but its totally worth the wait b/c the tacos are soooo good.  Every time I'm in Vegas or San Diego I make sure to include Tacos El Gordo in my itinerary.   There's just no other place like it.  BTW don't expect 5 star service here.  Its elbow to elbow at times to get to the front of the taco line.  Don't be afraid to call out the fat Mexican dude who's trying to cut in front of you!

We've been to restaurants in Mexico, San Diego, Texas, etc.  that don't offer food as tasty as Tacos El Gordo's Adobadas Mulas.  If you are into healthy eating, don't order this but if you want to indulge, stand in the Mulas line first.  The Tripas tacos is also great if you like offal like I do.  Tried the Cabeza but was mild tasting compared to the Mulas and Tripas.  After we finished eating, saw another customer with a large grilled green pepper and green onions and read later it is free but not on the menu so you have to ask for it.

Pork marinated in a red chili sauce with vinegar and oregano.  There is one line for all things abodabo, so make sure you're in the right line.  We also got the abodabo fries - the same pork over fries with a bunch of yummy sauce all over it!  And the half order is HUGE!  The other line is for all other tacos - we also got carne asada tacos.  Those were good too but I'm an abodabo fan!  You can also get a side of grilled veggies.  And then there's a jalapeno, lime, and radish bar... to garnish your tacos.  Salsa is behind the counter where you pay so you have to ask for it.   Definitely a must do when in Las Vegas! The only other place you can experience Tacos El Gordo is in Tijuana.",

I thought, \"ohhh i'll just have 2 tacos\" but ended up eating 3, stealing one of my bf's. Squeeze some lime on each of those puppies and we were in heaven!  Ordered 2 more tacos after finishing the initial 8.  Don't bother with the carne asada tacos.  Pretty bland with a strange taste that follows. Make sure you try the Orange Bang from the fountain machine.  Its like a orange creamsicle.  I hear it also serves as an awesome chaser to vodka.  (We refilled and took some back to the hotel).  They have an array of your mexican fountain drink, jaritos, horchata, tamarine bang, just to name a few.   The folks that work here are super friendly and just downright outgoing.

Always packed and can be a little confusing for first timers as hordes of people seem to be haphazardly standing in random locations but fear not there is an order to the madness. There are different lines for each of the different meats. I'd say the hectic atmosphere even adds to the charm of this place. Great place to end a drunken night or grab a cheap but delicious bite. Order the Pastor with pineapple!",

I wasn't looking for anything too crazy just something fill my appetite . I had no crazy expectations for a Mexican restaurant on the strip. i was made a fan after my first bite. this humble little place packed a flavorful punch! the portions were big enough to share and the price was very reasonable. they even had their own hot sauce which i added to everything. all in all great food and friendly service.  I recommend: Asada fries & a Sope!",

If you squirm when out of your comfort zone, this may not be for you...as the Beef Tongue and Beef Head tacos spanked the pork taco!  PS. It is only the Asada line that is to the left...I finally figured that one out.  Everything else is available in the right-side line. I could have gone here everyday I was in Las Vegas.

You can choose from too many different meats: asada,adobada,lengua,chorizo,tripa,sesos. I usually order adobada tacos,they're the best from my point of view.  I also order a Vampiro, its like a quesadilla stuffed with carne asada, highly recommendable. They offer free grilled onions and chilli peppers. I also get  horchata its ok and not that sweet.  If you go to Vegas,this place its a must go. Its very affordable,opens after hours  and closes at 4 am in the morning.Tacos are just $2 dlls.....and they are worth it!!!!",

More reason, to rent a car, just to go to this place, because it is a little out of the way, even if your taking the duece. I don't want to waste any time getting there. I just wanna EAT!! I understand why this place gets so crowded.   Inside, obviously gets packed, so its best to sit outside in the patio area. Ya......EVERY visit to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here...no doubt. You just have to check it out yourself!! I can't wait to try their other stuff!! =D",

Thanks so much to my homie, Ruben for showing me the epicness that is Tacos El Gordo. Luckily, the first time I entered with the homie, there was no line so ordering and getting the food was almost instant. However, when I came EDC weekend, the lines were out the door! Nonetheless, this food is totally worth waiting for. The stuff that I have tried here include: Al pastor tacos, al pastor quesadilla, and a half order of carne asada fries.  The al pastor meat is seriously the best al pastor I've ever indulged in. The meat is super tender, juicy, well marinated, and overall awesome. I love the nice little crunch the outside of the meat has from the rotisserie cooking process. The al pastor tacos also get some toppings such as cilantro, onion, and a creamy sauce. As for the carne asada fries, the portions are huge. A regular order can feed about 4-5 people and a half order can take care of 2-3 people. The fries are perfectly crisp and are covered with delicious carne asada, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and some other sauce...drool worthy deliciousness. Not only do they have epic food, but their drink machine options are unique and refreshing. I absolutely am in love with their Orange Bahng drink. Overall, this taqueria is the seriously the best ever.",

Seating can be sparse and napkins are thin (a detail most people could'nt care less about) but with salsa dripping down your fingers you will notice. Or you can be an animal and lick the salsa off your fingers.... like me! Okay stop reading this.... stop... park.... walk in... and order adobada tacos already!",

Just from the first bite, I knew I should have gotten more... My friends all couldn't resist taking a bite out of my tacos and they were all so pleasantly surprised. Thus we were all disappointed that I had not gotten more. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to come back before the end of our Vegas trip. But you bet I'll come back here again next time!",

No joke when you say that you need comfort food after party all night and hang over.  So there are different lines for different types of meat, look at what you want so you dont line the wrong line.  Most popular is Al Pastor, because it is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>!!! The meat is juicy and just right amount of spices.  The tortilla cook fresh, and the sauce on top is tasty too.  I wished that I had more time to line other lines and try other meat.    You have to come and try it yourself, once you do and you will get hook! Price is good, come on you are on the strip, and where can you feed yourself with less than 10 bucks?! Satisfy yourself with some quality tacos...Vegas babe",

They were you typical quesadilla, vs the Mexican cheese browned and then picked up with your tortilla.  Still good though.",

Upon getting to the front door we're asked which protein we wanted and we were sent off to that particular line serving it.  We came here for the Al Pastor tacos and it did not disappoint. The man serving the meat was quick and he knew what he was doing. Getting a table outside wasn't too bad.  The tacos were delicious. The pork was tender and seasoned well. I recommend squeezing the lime for that extra tangy taste. My fiance and I each ate three, but I could've easily gone for two more.  Check this place out if you're ever near the strip.",

    "text": "Looking for cheap and yummy eats near The Strip? Go to Tacos El Gordo. The closest location to me is in SD, so I wanted to make a stop here at the Vegas location less than a mile from our hotel. The lines are long, but move fairly quickly. If you're looking for the best filling to price ratio, their carne asada tacos are a must. Four of these babies and you'll definitely be full.   They serve a variety of other things like quesadillas, fries, mulas, EVEN PALETAS etc. But we definitely came for the tacos. Once I saw one of the ladies slap on strips of lard, hand-press, and fry the tortillas on the grill from the pile of masa, I was sold.  The only annoying part is that there are separate lines for certain selections of meats. So if you want different types of meat like I did, you're going to need to stand in separate lines. If you want a shorter wait time, I suggest you bring a friend to stand in the other lines for you.  We tried the asada, lengua, cabeza, and adobada. All the meats were juicy, not dry at all. Very flavorful. Lengua and cabeza cost more than the carne asada tacos, but has a smaller amount of filling in comparison. The adobada is seasoned so well and it doesn't have the overwhelming gamey taste of pork. Lengua was slightly crispy, but not the best lengua I've had before. Cabeza was also just alright. They hook it up with the guacamole on the carne asada tacos.  Overall: You need to come here if you're looking for the best tacos in Vegas. Finding seating can be really hard at first, so just be patient and don't be afraid to ask people for the empty seats around them.",

From my experience eating around San Diego taco shops, the carne asada here is actually relatively flavorless. Their guac also is not very flavorful (comes with the asada). Immediately get in line for the al pastor and order 3! The al pastor is really what San Diegans come for!",

The place was busy but it was not for the lack of service it was just so in demand. I could see them making the tortillas for their tacos fresh and right on the spot! They were cutting hot dripping meat from huge chunks of perfectly cooked meats, then they were throwing them into warm fresh homemade tacos. Some things that I wished was better was the seating. The indoor seating is tough and can be hard to get, I just wished they had better seating, but they have outside seating which is a little better.

He had been wanting to try it for a while based on recommendations by multiple friends.   When we finally made it in, it was on a weekday night. It was fast service, messy, and crazy delicious. I don't eat much meat generally but allowed myself a bit more during pregnancy so as to ensure I was introducing my child to all sorts of flavors and ingredients (and therefore avoid allergies or autoimmune problems).   I have to admit, these were probably the best tacos I had ever eaten in my life. And I say this despite my OCD-ish side getting annoyed with the plentiful fillings spilling out all over my hands and face. I only tried the spicy pork and carne asada, but it was clear they have perfected what they do here.   I minus one star for controversial reasons only: my frustration with the messiness and the lack of vegan options. (Of course, I say that, and I didn't even try their vegetarian tacos made with whole beans in place of the meat!)",

We ended up waiting 50 minutes for tacos for one type of taco and gave up on the beef taco because of that issue. There needs to be a better system regarding how to order.

    "text": "What a happy find! I was just walking along all hungry for some protein and there was this taco shop calling my name! I guess I was early because I was able to walk right up and ordered my food and was full and happy less than 15 mins tops. That was at 11 in the morning. I walked by again around 12:30 and the line was out the door! There were all sorts of unappetizing cuts of meat there, like cow brain, gross. It didn't looks like they had chicken though, just beef and pork. But I stuck with good ole sliced beef taco, I don't remember the name. I chose to have it on a corn tortilla which was super fresh and soft, the meat had great flavor and was topped with an Avocado sauce which was also good. One taco was $2.40. I'll be back but I'll make sure to go early again so I don't have to wait In line! They also have really good looking frozen fruit bars in a cooler near the drinks.",

I ordered 4 of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, and i definitely could have more! Each taco is served in a mini corn tortilla. At $2 each, you can't go wrong!!! I am sad that I didn't get to try the carne asada fries, so that's a must for my next visit to sin city.   This location is about a 10 minute walk from The Wynn, so it is definitely very convenient for those staying there.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good, affordable food on the strip!!",

Being annoyed at all this waiting I was paying for my food and the female cashier was being rude and unprofessional... All in all the food was meh... at BEST. Do not, and I repeat do not, expect this place to be good just because of the huge lines. Looks can be deceiving.",

Not great if you go alone. A group that splits up works best.   This place is EXTREMELY loud. It's in Vegas on the strip so most patrons will be intoxicated.   The flavor was great. I recommend it.",

So I did as many others were doing, ate my tacos before paying, which pissed off the cashier and a couple of the workers so now everyone was happily joined in pissedoffness over their ridiculous set up. Maybe after giving away tacos and giving customers and workers a terrible time, they'll get smart and do business the normal way. The tacos were good of course,(anything is good in a tj style steamed meat greased tortilla) but not worth the hour you'll waste trying to get a couple of different meats. I suggest driving a little further down to Charleston ave where the other gordo is at, wich is busy, but you'll be eating in ten minutes tops.",

This girl was like \"Leena, I can tell when you really like your food...you're really into it and it looks like your really like it!\" Uhhh...yea! That was this moment.   There are a bunch of lines so just go to the shortest one...I went to the older man because he looked like he knew what to do with a giant cow and a grill. Then you can speak to him in your broken Spanish and ask for errrything. I notice that the non-traditional folks ask for cheese and all but if you want it really legit, then all you need is their special salsas and cilantro.   OH and I forgot about the spicy pork! So good, so good so good! I do like the fancy pants restaurants. But it's places like this where I'm like, why did I just drop all them dimes on that meal when i just enjoyed these tacos and they were just as delicious...if not more! ::sigh:: #foodieproblems  Oh...but the drinks...I would suggest either BYOB OR a bottled beverage that they have....I would like to go back though and try their homemade beverages but as you can see, with 2 different animals and 5 different parts inside me, I was a bit occupied ;)",

    "text": "Just as amazing as the San Diego locations. Tacos El Gordo never disappoints! Just be sure to avoid peak hours during both lunch and dinner because the line will be out the door!   Came here for the first time this past Saturday around 4 - the wait was not tooo bad. The line was not out the door surprisingly and had to wait a bit, but the food makes the wait worthwhile. My favorite is the pastor which is spicy pork. Yum! Got pastor tacos and mulas. The meat is always so perfect and they have the best horchata.   Tried to get a second fix on Sunday before leaving Vegas. Stopped by around noon and the line was out the door and we turned around and grabbed lunch elsewhere only cause we had to catch a flight. If I wasn't on a time crunch, I would be more than willing to wait in line. These tacos will not disappoint! Must try if you haven't already. And definitely great price compared to the overpriced food on the Vegas strip.",

Tacos are about $2.25/each... the tortillas are handmade and each tack is filled with onions and cilantro and a green sauce.   I read everywhere that the carne asada fries were a must try... honestly, I wish I didn't order them. They come in half and a full size... we ordered the full size which was like $12-$13 and it was gross. Fries topped with a bit of carne asada meat and some cheese sauce.  It just wasn't good unless I guess you're just a big fan of french fries in general.    Tacos were a definite five stars.",

This place is a dream for taco lovers but for firt time people, navigating the restaurant and ordering the food can be a bit confusing as you will noticed 3 different queues and they can be very long.  So after scanning through the menu posted overhead, the first question to ask is what do you want to get because it's important to be in the right queue (one is stricly campechana and pork, another is beef, chorizo, mulas, sopes and the third is cabeza, tripa, lengua),  as the lines can be long or stay on one and ordered whatever you want from that one.  After getting all of your food, take it to the cashiers which are located on the other corner of the restaurant and pay for the food and the drinks there. The cashier will give you the cups for the drinks.  I got the taco de asada and the cabeza and just loved them - so delicious! The complimentary grilled onion and japapeno they offered also paired well with the tacos and who can complain about the added radishes and lime! Great meal at the amazing price - I look forward to returning for more next time!",

    "text": "** Tasty and authentic tacos, but always a really long wait at almost any time of the day. Very hard to order many different varieties if you are alone, proteins are hit or miss.   I first found out about Tacos El Gordo from my friend in San Diego who once posted a picture on her instagram of these tacos and I screenshotted it because they looked so good. So when I saw that they had a chain here, I was determined to check it out.   I came for dinner with three other friends on New Years Eve, and the line was pretty long and going well beyond the door. Inside was really crowded as well. We decided to split up and each order a few tacos from each line, since the way it works is that you have lines for individual proteins, and have to wait in that line just to order that kind of taco (ex: line for pork tacos).  After awhile, we only ordered from a few of the lines because the line for the steak was just ridiculous. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that the person he was once standing in line next to was still waiting as we finished dinner and left.   I remember I ordered the spicy pork, but my friend ordered a ton of weird meats that I don't quite remember because they were first of all in Spanish and my friend isn't really a foodie so didn't really pay attention to these things. The spicy pork tacos were heavenly... everything just tastes so good with the fresh tortillas, salsa, guac, and meat.   HOWEVER, I do have to say that a lot of these meats were pretty whack, at least in my opinion. There was one that was white and looked like intestine, kind of tasted like tripe that you eat in pho.. but in a taco. Another was weird and crispy, giving it a dry feeling and kind of gave me the impression thats how people prepare insects (no I've never eaten bugs before).    If only we were able to get to meats like the carne asada (I really wanted to try the fries but never had the chance) I think this place would have be perfect. Everything about the tacos are good, the challenge is just choosing the best proteins when you have limited time cuz you need to turn up later.",

So if you are looking for some good tacos, hey this is just not the spot. BTW if you get in line and the pastor meet finishes on that line you'll be ask to move to a new line even when you have been waiting for 20+ minutes. Not cool but hey when you're hungry and have been waiting for a while you put up with this kind of service.   Thanks Yelp you make our life better!",

    "text": "Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to visit this place! This taco shop is a decent sized place that is almost always packed full of people. It is located by the Wynn hotel and there is a parking lot for those that don't want to walk or want to be dropped off there. But be warned, like many places on the Strip there will be a long line (although it is definitely worth it). And there is also security monitoring the doors to make sure people don't cut and that the whole process is more \"organized\".   How it works- there are multiple lines you can go in depending on what kind of meat you want. So if you are coming in a group I would recommend each of you to tackle a different line and order for one another. For example, if my friends and I want Asada and Adobada, one of my friends would stand in the Asada line and I would stand in the Adobada line. After getting the tacos we would split them up on our trays and then go pay at the registers.    There are two different lines for the most popular meats, the Asada & the Adobada (4 in total), and 1 line off to the side for the less popular (but still amazing) meats like Cabeza, Lengua, and Buche. Each taco is about $2.25-$2.50 each, and they also have grilled onions and peppers if you ask for it. What's amazing is that you can have your tacos on either a homemade corn  tortilla or a homemade flour tortilla. I'm a sucker for a fresh tortilla! They also have sopes, quesadillas, and tostadas too but they don't have burritos. My favorite meat hands down is the Adobada (spicy pork), definitely give it a try!   Honestly I think the biggest struggle isn't even the wait- it's to get a table. Because the place is always packed with people I literally feel like I have to fight someone to get a table. Every time I have been here I literally had to watch the tables like a hawk for someone to get up to leave, but there's always other customers trying to do the same thing. I would honestly recommend just taking it to go if you don't have the energy for that. Also, if you come during the summer expect to sweat. The AC is just not strong enough to accommodate all the customers, and workers behind the counter. The last time I visited, I was hit by a cloud of smoke coming from the stoves after walking in.    The reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because sometimes I get a little hangry waiting for so long for some tacos, (even if it's worth it), and the fact that finding a table is struggle. Other than that, amazing tacos at a decent price- so definitely try it out if you are in Vegas!",

    "text": "I was told that they had the best tacos in Vegas.  I even heard a gentleman say that they were the best tacos in line. I was excited to try them.    Boy was I bamboozled, you order your tacos from different lines depending on the meat. They have adovada which is really just el pastor.  They have the el pastor on a traditional cooking spit. I ordered my tacos and got them immediately to find out my wife in line for asada tacos. So I had to wait 25 minutes for her to get her asada tacos. We then found out we had to got to a separate line to pay and wait another 5 minutes to pay. By the time we got the table so the four of us could sit together which was bananas our food was cold. Be that as it may, I was still excited to try the alleged great tacos. I bit into my pastor and wished I had gravy or vaseline due to the meat being so dry. The flavor at best was mediocre. The home made tortillas were delightful though.  I asked for cheese and got a container of shredded Kraft cheese. U hoped that the asada tacos would be better seeing they had the same home made tortillas, eh wrong I bit into another dry mildly flavored taco. I can appreciate that the servers grill and cut the meet right at the counter, but if your doing that please make sure the flVor matches the flare. It was over crowded and over priced. I will not return to Tacos El Gordo. Before I said my opinion I asked my 9 year old son what he thought. He had three words for me without skipping a beat \"It was trash\".",

    "text": "One of the best cheap eats on the strip. This restaurant is behind Encore beachclub which is definitely a walkable distance. Tacos at this restaurant average at about $2.50 each.  The line up is quite different.. There are various line ups at the counter and you have to pay attention to the signs to make sure you are at the right line based on what you want to order.  We ordered the beef tongue taco, steak taco and the spicy pork taco all of them taste pretty good.. The spicy pork is a little bit on the dry side though but overall it's a good late night snack.  They offer plates of veggies with cooked green onions/ peppers.. They also have limes and beets up for grabs.  They have horchata and tamarind juice too which is pretty hard to find out there..  This restaurant opens till 2am monday to thursday and on weekends.. They open till 5am.. Definitely stop by if you feel hungry after partying late night!",

    "text": "If you're going to Encore or leaving... you MUST swing by this place to grab some bomb cheap tacos!! It's literally one block away. Nothing fancy, just some delicious authentic tacos. You walk in, and there's signs directly telling you which line to place your orders for specific taco's or other items you wish on the menu. It's an open view kitchen where you could see all the love that is going into it while seeing and smelling the meats being stewed or grilled which is pretty cool. After you place your order, you bring it over to a separate cashier counter to pay... And that's where you may ask for a cup for free refills on whatever beverage you please for the Vegas hot weathers. They have some pretty unique Mexican fountain drink options such as mango juice, horchata, creamy orange drink, some sort of chrysanthemum or jasmine lemon ice tea, etc.   THE FOOD -- the two absolute must is the lengua (beef tongue) and the adobada (spicy pork). Lengua - for some of you who gets intimidated of eating something like tongue... Well, don't be. I'm not one who ever likes to eat tongue or those sort of things besides two exception.. Now 3 (Blue Ribbon, Tacos El Bronco, now hello Tacos El Gordo). It literally just looks like ordinary chunks of beef... And it totally blows my usual NYC's fave taco spot's lengua taco. It's not as mushy but yet it's still tender. Adobada - the spicy pork was flavorful along with the fresh topping and verde sauce. It wasn't too spicy too which is a plus for me since I'm a baby when it comes to spice.  The line wasn't long to order at all and I was able to grab a table right away. This place seriously is generous and stuffs the hell out of your tacos and the shell of the tortilla is so well made!",

    "text": "--LOCATION-- Near Wynn. It's a shop facing the street; not inside a hotel or anything  --PARKING-- there is a parking lot, but try walking there if you can. I walked from Palazzo.  --MENU-- tacos, tortas, quesadillas, fries, etc. NO BURRITOS. Each taco is either $2.40 or $2.25 depending on which meat you get. Each taco comes with cilantro, green sauce (i think it was guac..), and diced onion. They will cut up the meat and prepare your orders right in front of you.   There's a radish (whole and sliced) and lime bar  I ordered 6 carne asada tacos and 8 lengua tacos. Total~ $36  --ORDER-- Each line is a meat station. You line up and order based off of what meat you want to get. I went alone and it took me 45 min-60 min from start to finish. I wanted to get the spicy pork, but I gave up and just got extra lengua.  I SUGGEST GOING WITH A GROUP TO SPLIT UP AND ORDER TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITH TIME.   Pay at cashier once you got your orders.   --SEATING-- There are a lot of tables, but you may not be able to sit down because of how popular and crowded it gets.   --SERVICE-- They move very fast and very slowly. The lines took foreverrrrr to move. But when I was finally in front, it looked like the meat station guys moved very quickly. My carne asada guy did disappear mid-order though...  --OVERALL-- very stressful experience. I was also soooo disappointed that my lengua tacos were pretty skinny. The carne asada tacos were filled to a decent amount. Some of my tacos really didn't have enough toppings, either. The meat themselves were juicy, but I admit I've had better in LA.  I wish they had pico de gallo or spicy sauces or jalapenos at the radish/lime bar. But in a way I'm glad they don't because I know that would just cause more lines and more waiting and more chaos.   I think this is more like a 3.5/5 star for me, but I'll round up to 4/5.",

I AM SO GLAD THEY BROUGHT THIS STORE BACK!!!!!  Sometimes, i plan my hotels located nearby taco el gordo.  if you don't like taco el gordo, you're not human.  there is a reason this place is always packed, ans rightfully so.    the different types of lines and meats and items you can get will be confusing for new comers, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be a taco pro.  the food is really fresh here and the service is friendly and they try and work as fast as they can to accommodate everyone.    as for the drinks, make sure you get yourself a cup of orange bang to wash everything down.",

Def. one the best taco joint on the strip. I really enjoyed the amount of options they had available when you order. They also give you plenty of condiments to customize your taco.   + pluses..... great tacos and variety of them and also the included condiments.  - this is where it begins to get real sketch on the strip, don't let it fool you that its right next to WYnn and Encore, right north of here is super sketchy. Also there maybe long lines (i realize this isn't really anything they can do about).   Always tasty and always an interesting experience at Tacos El Gordo. YMMV",

    "text": "Service + Interior: 4 Price vs. Quantity: 5 Food Taste: 5  This place is legit. That's the best way I can describe it. When you walk into a PACKED taco joint and you're the only non-Hispanic person there, that's when you know you're going to get some good tacos.  When you walk in it can be confusing at first. There's numerous lines and it's not very clear why. You have to actually pick the meat you want first, and then you stand in the right line that serves that meat. That can be kind of annoying though, because if you want pork tacos AND steak tacos you gotta stand in two lines to get them. I suggest bringing a friend if you can to cut the time in half.  My partner and I went in separate lines. He wanted asada (steak) and I wanted adobada (spicy pork). The lines can go by quickly or slowly depending on if the people ahead of you are ordering 50 tacos or not. The workers make the tacos pretty darn quick and cram as many as they can on a small plate.  They have a section where you can get some fresh limes and radishes to enhance your taco eating. Then you head over to the cash register. The prices are very reasonable, and for Vegas, cheap.  Good luck finding a seat if you go during a rush. The tacos were delicious. I tried the adobada first. It wasn't very spicy, but the flavor was great! The pork is similar if not the same as al pastor, but there wasn't any hint of the pineapple sweetness. It was just a nice spiced flavor. They put a good amount of onions without overwhelming, some cilantro, and two different sauces which I couldn't tell what they were. None of the pork was fatty or greasy.  The asada was amazing! You could taste that grill char flavor and you can tell the meat is fresh. They put a dollop of guac on it too and for no additional cost *cough*Chipotle*cough* and let me tell you about the glorious after taste that the tacos leave in your mouth afterwards. You'll be licking your chops to get another hit of that savory flavor.   The chorizo taco we got was ok. The chorizo itself was not uber greasy like a lot of other places, but the flavor was lacking a little. The tortillas are made fresh right where the meat is being cooked and they had a nice slightly chewy consistency.",

    "text": "I just want to start this post off by thanking the man or woman who had the genius and creativity to invent what we call tacos today. Then I would like to thank Mr. Gordo for perfecting the craft. Tacos el Gordo is HANDS and FEET DOWN and BY FAR the best tacos ever! If anyone knows something better, please don't hide it from me.  Spending 4 years in San Diego, I had the honor and privilege of experiencing these mouth watering tacos in Chula Vista. Now that they have location in Las Vegas too, it gives me another excuse of visit the sin city more often!   The location located right next to Wynn and isn't too big. Sometimes it may be hard to get seats, but there's a big area outdoors where you can enjoy them standing up. Depending on the meat you're craving for, you lineup at different stations designated for different meats. Once you accumulated all the tacos, then you pay at the cashier.   LENGUA tacos (cow tongue) are a must get here! The lengua pieces are bigger than normal, but it has just the perfect combination of chewiness that a lengua is supposed to have. You can get this in taco form or on top of fries as well. They give you two layers of tortilla, but I would recommend just eating one as it could get filling. Ihave never been so happy to French kiss a cow before!   The pork adobada is another must have as they carve it right off the rotisserie and onto your tacos! You can even ask them to carve off some chunks of the pineapple to your taco to add the extra ZING! Please note, this station is labeled \"adobada & el pastor\" but they are the same thing! Don't be THAT person that asks for one adobada AND a pastor, it's embarrassing. I would know...  This place opens until 4AM and is good for lunch, dinner, midnight snack when you're a bit on the tipsy side or after club supper! You can literally walk to here from XS!   All hail Gordo!",

They kept having a number of difficulties because of too much smoke building inside for the carne asada but finally after an hour they said you either had to wait about another hour for the carne asada or grab some tacos de pastor which are my favorite anyways so that was some good news finally. They put some avocado cream stuff that I wanted to give a chance to but I don't recommend getting it on your tacos. The pastor is delicious and juicy just the way it is and it is more than fine with the original onion and cilantro on it! I gave it 4 stars because of the difficulties they kept having and the people in front of me say that it happens pretty often so maybe when I come back again, it will be fixed and I can have a more positive review.",

    "text": "This place, although Mexican, reminds me a lot of the open markets back in Thailand that had the most affordable and delicious food. There were numerous employees, all very friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there, one of the guys let us try a little bit of every meat (more like he handed it to us without question).  I tried five different tacos - the spicy pork (adobada), steak (asada), tripe, beef shoulder (suadero), and beef tongue (lengua). The tacos also came with nice portion of cooked green onion and jalapeno! Every taco was great and had the perfect portion of meat, sauce, and vegetables (which is something you will rarely hear me say). My favorites were the adobada and tripe.   I also got horchata, which turned out to have INFINITE REFILLS. My good friend and I were ecstatic over that for quite a while.  Next time I'll try out their fries for sure.",

The lines were so long until I realized that the way the ordering system was set up is brilliant. They separate the lines by the type of meat you want on your tacos. Perfect! I didn't want asada tacos which was the longest line. I wanted to have the lengua (cow tongue) tacos I just had to have them. I was saved from one of the employees who was super friendly to go to the other line were they also have lengua tacos.   The wait was worth it! The meat was fresh and served when you order it just how you want it. It's a simple place that gets it and I like that. When you are done ordering you head over to the cashier and you pay there for your food and drink (if you get one). I loved that they had the lime and radish for you to get as much as you wanted. The tacos are priced at $2 a taco and I found it to be a good deal.   Will I go back? Most definitely its a must!",

There are different lines for different meats you want, so make sure to look at the lines and plan accordingly. It really helps if you have a friend with you to have the friend wait in another line. After you get amazing tacos with variety of meat, you go to the counter to pay.  I highly recommend Adobada, Carne Asada, and Chorizo.

    "text": "There is something distinctly wonderful about late night food in a city like LV.  The insatiable appetite for indulgence, the unrelenting yet ever flowing booze from all corners of the town. With the infamous Tijuana chain Tacos El Gordo in the mix, the game has now changed ... for the better.   Located inside of a strip mall just around the corner of Wynn/Encore, this spot is the perfect alternative to the spendy options of late night spots mid-strip. Folks who are familiar with the Cali locations should notice the mini-spike in prices here from .15-45 cents per item. It's still a inexpensive deal on the Strip and an even cheaper / tastier option that most tacos in NYC. I digress.  The late night hours from Thursday-Sunday is often their busiest times here. Lines from post-XS / Tryst crowds of drunken club goers crowd up this small spot. No sense in sprinting to Earl of Sandwich (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/earl-of-sandwich-las-vegas#hrid:rCEJrFmkm-Y5nNg1MhO7VQ\">yelp.com/biz/earl-of-san...</a>) when the $10 for a sandwich translates to 4 tacos and a drink here.  A True San Diegan Mexican treat - the carne asada fries ($10) are the real deal. A mile high mountain of carne asada beef, salsa, cheese, and crema over fries is terrible for anyone's diet but delicious nonetheless. Tacos of all kinds - adobados, carnitas, de cabeza, orejas, lenguas - are superb in every sense. Vegans ought to look the other way but carnivores of the Mexican loving kind will be delighted with most everything on the menu. There is no words to describe the joy of fresh, shaved, carnitas on a perfectly grilled corn tortilla with a little salsa verde, cilantro and bits of cebolla, all folded to make for a juicy, super sabrosa bite.  I could go on and on about these tacos, but if there is any thing worth mentioning it's that the Downtown location (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-gordo-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-go...</a>) is even better.

Being a San Diego native, and frequently vising TJ , multiple border town and Baja California locations I would recommend this place to those looking to get that similar flavor and taste. All the right meats, and added stuff to go along with each dish. More importantly, they had Carne Asada fries which gives me that reminder from back home. Side bar is stocked with limes/radish slices, but salsa needs to be asked for each time. Customer Service I'd give a 6/10, employees do not look happy to serve the countless amount of tipsy people and tourists from all over the world, which I don't blame them. Overall food is delicious if you're looking for that added fuel for your casino hopping and keeping the party going.",

The al pastor and asada were both on the dry side and I got more of the burnt bits. The lengua was actually pretty good but overall I felt like all three tacos were lacking the certain depth of flavor that I was used to from the SD Tacos El Gordo. And the salsas of each taco are usually one of the parts that I enjoy the most, but each were pretty bland/underseasoned. As a huuuge taco fan, I was pretty disappointed :( Maybe it would've tasted better if I were drunk and leaving the club, but  I want my tacos to taste good sober, too!",

Our table was dirty but we were waiting for someone to leave, someone came in to clean the table shortly after.  TASTE: BOMB!! tacos are my weakness and this place didn't disappoint.  WORTH THE PRICE?: yes! keep in mind, you are on the strip and considering how much food is in Vegas this is a great price.  RECOMMENDATIONS: Mulas all the way, it has cheese, guacamole, salsa with your meat of choice. everything you need in one bite. Out of all the meats my favorite was al pastor.  WILL I COME BACK?: Heck yes! this place is amazing!  TIPS AND NOTES: Be ready to wait, long lines! it is worth the wait but you might have to eat outside. There are no tables outside and the dining area inside is very small, so eating standing up is definitely going to happen.",

I am still not sure what a sope or a mula are.  (I do know what lengua and sesos are!)  I ordered an adobada taco.  Back home we'd call it a street taco - small, in a corn tortilla.  I also ordered the carne asada fries.  I watched in horror as the lady dumped guacamole on them - I hate guac.  Luckily it was just in the corner, so I ate around it.  The food was cheap and relatively tasty.  I was here around 3pm and it wasn't crowded, but the ordering at different windows for different meats was still confusing.  I don't get why this place evidently has 45 minute waits at times.  It was fine but nothing to write home about.",

We went there almost every day when we visited for a week. Perfect for lunch on your way to the strip.... or on your way home at 3am (hangover prevention). :)   The carne asada tacos are out-of-this-world! Flavorful beef, guacamole, onions and cilantro on their homemade corn tortillas. The quesadilla is also amazing!! Tried both in a corn torilla and flour tortilla - both equally delish!   They also serve roasted peppers and green onions as a side with your taco or quesadilla. Not sure what to do with those but just ate it separately... they are soaked in butter and good! :)  Dont bother with fancy restaurants on the strip... try this place!!! :)",

Some people have acid flashbacks, I had a taco flashback to being 18 and partying it up in Rosarito beach and eating a delicious drunky taco. 100%, totally, undeniably legit pork tacos. I love that people say that the carne asada fries are \"really big, enough for 2-3 people,\" yeah or enough for one drunk person at 3am.   We came on a Monday at 2pm and the line went out the door. Be willing to wait, your taste buds will thank you for it.  Twenty bucks will buy you four tacos, one carne asada fries and two drinks. Where else in Vegas will you eat this good for that cheap? That was a rhetorical question.  Last note: Leave the staff a tip, they work their asses off and do it with a huge smile.",

Walked in after the first day of the League Championship Series Spring Finals with my friend Akinola and got into one of the empty lines -- which was the al pastor line. Why aren't people in this line? Y'all tripping. We got a bunch of tacos, a pair of aguas frescas and some paletas.  The tacos did not disappoint. They never do. I was insanely sad when this location closed down and I couldn't make it last year. Maybe I overrate this place because it's the closest thing to eating tacos like I used to have back home. There's nothing like this in Miami, unfortunately. This is a pilgrimage I will always make every year, every time I am in Vegas.  This location being open again was one of the happiest things I'd heard in a while. I am always effusive in my praise about this place.  I am biased. Stick me on a trompo spit and roast me al pastor, for all I care. These are the best tacos I can think of that you can get in Las Vegas, bar none. These are some of the best tacos I can think of that you can find anywhere in the US, for that matter.  We sat down. We ate like kings. Eight tacos al pastor, some carne asada, some chorizo, some cebollitas and some peppers. Waited like five minutes for our entire order, sat down in another five and we were out of there in less than thirty. We considered coming back later in the weekend. I sent legions of friends, both old ones and recently-made ones over the weekend, to eat at this place. They loved it.  We'll return.  We always return.",

I remember seeing Tacos El Gordo on Yelp before coming to Vegas and I wanted to try it so bad because of their awesome reviews.

A definite must eat whether drunk, sober, alive, or dead.. you will not regret it.",

    "text": "There are a lot of taco trucks in LA, but I have to admit, this place is so delicious! Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I almost always make a trip here when I'm in Vegas. It's super close to the strip, so the drive is not bad (assuming Las Vegas Blvd doesn't have any traffic). However, parking can be hard to find if the plaza is super busy.  My favorite is the Adobada (spicy pork/pastor) tacos for $2. The Carne Asada fries are also really yummy. They're $10, but HUGE, enough to share for 4-5 people.  I always want to try other items, but I'm always craving the Adobada that I forget to!  FYI, the water from the soda fountain tastes weird.",

When you order, they'll ask if you want everything on it (toppings & sauces), say yes!  Avoid long line by going in the day time, it's super packed after midnight but it's also the best time to eat when you're drunk :)",

    "text": "In an ideal world, this is how it supposed to work out:   Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.  So much for the ideal world ...  Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue / tripe / beef shoulder).   So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...  Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue / should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ...   Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos.   In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?    Well, these tacos better be amazing right?  tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!    Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good.   Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price).   I will stick with my East LA tacos ... they are still the bomb and my ultimate taco standards.",

Tacos El Gordo gets 5 stars from me. cleanliness, location, price, quality, flavor and free drink refills and I'm taking horchata on tap!  first, walking in you would be skeptic. they have most of the meat on a turning spit like gyros or shawarma meat holders. but rest assured it's all delicious.  I've had almost all of the meat offered there. some of it I'm not touching because I could be insecure when it comes to questionable titles on food names, so I'll stock with the usual meats.  the spicy pork meat is amazing. the beef is right behind it as far as flavor goes. carne asada is yummy. I like to get a assortment of tacos when I go...like a mix of donuts mmmmm.  the quesadilla is not what you think. it's a small tortilla with the cheese cooked on the grill, then placed on the tortillas and topped with a crunchy shell. it is not big at all, but very delicious. I'm not sure why it's so expensive, but I pay it (maybe that's why)  the food always taste consistent, fresh. quality is perfect.  guacamole is made fresh and the spread is great. the toppings are just all around good.  I'm a fan and will be back for more",

You just stand in front of the line depending on which type if meat you want. I would suggest standing in the adobada line!!!   My friends and I always come here late nights.  If you want mexican food I would come here! Better than Fausto's and Roberto's. :)  5 stars for sure!",

    "text": "3 stars . why ? The flavor is amazing even down to the tortilla ! One of the most authentic not authentic but pretty damn close. The asada? A smoked flavor you're sure hard to find any where else. Highly recommend it for people who are visiting our of the western side of the United States. Why the 3 ? What kind of service or way is it to serve tacos PER person . doesn't make sense ? If Sally is in front of you and she wants 3 tacos al pastor. The cook will make it for her but not take ANY other orders until he finishes Sally. So say you want 4 tacos al pastor. Well he could easily make 7 all together so you and Sally can walk away happily. You know like the rest of the world. But oh no not at tacos Gordo. The slow service and constant reviews you read about coming early because it gets busy isn't because it gets busy. Its because of Einstein in the back who came up with the revolutionary idea it making one by one by one by one and have each and every person waiting. That they stick with the same service is just plain well idiotic for a lack of a better word. Of you're coming here pack a basket and a sandwich and prepare to wait as the person taking your order is also COOKING it.  P.s. don't get the green puke that's thrown in top of it. Don't understand where the authentic comes from with the green slime thrown on top",

So while we were in Vegas last week, we thought..what the heck, let's check it out before the 4 hour drive home. First bad move: we went at lunch time(12pm) and the line was out the door! Second bad move: their lines are confusing af!!! One line for al pastor another line if you want asada, etc..you catch my drift. Third bad move: THERE IS NO SEATING! people are like vultures for seating so we ate in our car. So small in their you're better off eating outside or in your vehicle than rubbing shoulders with a bunch of strangers.   The BEST Move? THE TACOS, SOPES, AND CARNE ASADA FRIES WERE AMAZING!!!!!!

My boyfriend of nearly 2 years would not stop bragging how he had the best tacos eveRrR in his life. Anywhere we'd gone to eat at tacos, he'd mention \"I've had better, can't wait to take you there\" LOL. I couldn't stand trying to please this guy...but then voila...we're in Vegas. He says let's get the best tacos EVER!  We're now waiting in this long line of 100+ degree weather. My mouth is salivating. It smells delicious and the view of everyone else eating outside is making me drool. Being the impatient gf that I am- I want to leave, but luckily, by my surprise - some lady walks by offers fans LOL the cutest fans ever (keeping It my purse for future hot days such as this). So my impressions so far made me want to stay and boy was I glad!!!!!  We walked in the lines are obviously long af and we finally got to order. Overall we had about 9 tacos each. That's right, we ordered with our stomachs and ate them ALL. No regrets.   I ate every. Single. One.  Taco de lengua, taco de cabeza, taco de sesos, taco de adoboda, and taco al pastor. Al pastor had to be my favorite. I did have 4 of those . You can't go wrong with this place. It was perfect. Can't wait to go back!!!!!",

Lol We ended up just getting 2 adobada tacos with everything.  Soooooo good! The tortillas are perfection, with slightly crispy edges. The meat is succulent and overall no shortage of fillings.  The line was insane and completely out the door the entire time. Tho FYI there are multiple lines inside based on which tacos you are actually ordering. So it's funny that we had wanted adobadas anyways but that happened to be the shortest line so win win for us! Seriously yummy tacos so glad to see they are still here and thriving!",

We came to Vegas last year and didn't have a chance to stop so we made sure we had lunch this year. Omg is all I can say. We had carne asada fries & tacos al pastor!! So yummy all of it. I ordered everything that comes in my tacos on the side since I eat a little slow and don't want my tortillas getting to soft before I can eat them. Omg the guacamole was amazing & the tortillas the lady makes them right there fresh. My son, husband and mother are all very picky and we left no leftovers and the temptation to stop once again before leaving. The Al Pastor meat they cut the pork right in front of you, and let me tell you they aren't stingy with the meat. Make sure you stand in the right line when ordering :) also their fountain drinks and Mexican drinks are all very very reasonably priced with refills. Where I live we can't even get a small horchata for $1.90 let alone any refills for free!! We will be coming back next year & are looking forward to it.",

Also even though it is tacos, it might not be the cheapest one, as you might average $20 per adult and some assume that tacos should be much cheaper. These are totally worth it!  The place is kept as clean as possible many employees are on it but hey they have a production line that goes around the corner cooking all kinds of delicacies, so of course it won't be spotless 24/7. But the place is clean and reliable.  Plus it is right on the strip and on Friday and Saturday there can be a line but it moves pretty quickly plus it is entertaining to see trays full of tacos for.those who seat outdoors.

When I first tried them, my friends brought it back to the hotel after a long night of clubbing and they tasted SO AMAZING. I wasn't sure if it was because we were super hungry and drunk, but I tried them again a couple of vegas trips later while SOBER and they were just as good as the first time! There is always a line out the door here even if it's not after clubbing hours. They have various stations here that form different lines for different meats you want. For ex: Lengua, asada, etc will be in one line and al pastor, pollo etc will be in another line. This gets tricky if you're here by yourself because the lines are so long that your food will get cold jumping from line to line.  If you happen to be here by yourself, ask them to cover your order in foil before you hop to the next line. There is a good amount of seating here, but they are always packed. These tacos are a bit on the pricey side, but for food on the strip it's what you would expect.  Their food is cooked FRESH you can see them slicing the al pastor and chopping up carne asada. I seriously eat about 6 tacos by myself because it's so good! My favorite is the al pastor and carne asada. Both meats are super flavorful, you don't need to top it with red or green sauce like at other taquerias. HIGHLY recommend you try this place at least once during your vegas trip. It's located in a plaza on the right side at the very end of the strip past Encore & Wynn.",

My son and I had carne asada tacos and they were delicious.

Kinda towards the back, there's another line for organ meats (cabeza, buche, lengua, and tripa).  After you get your food, you have to pay at the cashier.  I loved the al pastor tacos.  At about $2 a taco, it's full of flavor but they are kinda small.  The carne asada tacos were flavorful also.  I wasn't a fan of the quesadilla...... it was not something I was used to.  It was just meat on top of melted cheese on top of a tortilla.  They make their own tortilla and you can really taste it.  The carne asada fries were a hit.  Get them!  Trust!  Overall, awesome place to eat even if the lines are long.  Totally worth it.  They are open late so you can hit it up after a long night of clubbing.",

The basics are covered (Steak, Beef, Prok) so anyone can go and enjoy a fantastic taco, but what adds to the experience is that there are more adventurous options available as well. For example tongue, head meat, and brain!  They are all worth trying.  Make sure you get a plate of veggies! You get grilled spicy peppers and onions that you just eat with your hands as you eat the tacos!

That did not bother me very much though; it was the cashier who counted the number of tacos herself, overcharged me an extra taco, and failed to give my receipt when I paid for my food. After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour. Luckily, there is a Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.",

I think it's hard to stand out when you make tacos but they do a fairly well job and I can see myself coming back for more.  I'd suggest you try to get inside seating during the winter time to avoid your tacos getting cold as it happened to me.

I do not venture into the exotic and wild Mexican dishes of tongue, head, brain... ahem... sounds kinky but I digress.  I stayed safe and tried the steak taco, and it was tasty. I would have tried chicken, but to my dismay, el pollo did not appear on the menu.  It's a good, clean, typical fast food spot if you're looking for Mexican food.

Let me summarize my experience:  Cheap prices = check Delicious food = check Good service = check Open 24 / 7 = check Authentic = check Cleanliness = check Strip convenience without strip prices = check  This is not your average taco stand.  The staff all dons branded company T-shirts, the service is friendly, and it's not a hole-in-the-wall.  It also feels to commercialized to be authentic with it's stainless steel walls and fixed furniture.  Nonetheless, they've taken a simple concept and have executed it very well.    My sister and I came here around midnight.  We ordered two taco's each and one quesadilla to share.  Each taco (steak and pork) was succulent and full of flavor.  The quesadilla was the best I've ever had (full of steak with some excellent cheese).  Every order also comes along with grilled green onions and grilled whole jalapeno's... which were delicious as well.  You also get your choice of green and red salsa and accompaniments such as limes and radishes.  The food was so good that I could have had probably had eight tacos to myself.  Unfortunately, my stomach told me I was full after two tacos and half a quesadilla.  The total price of our meal for two?  Under $13 including tax.  This is how you win in Vegas.  I'll be back soon enough...",

Basically, there are 3 lines: 1 for carne asada, one for adobada (spicy pork, but it wasn't spicy at all) and another line for the other meats (tongue & I forgot what else).  No chicken!  YOU ORDER FIRST & THEN PAY.  The carne asada line was the longest (out the door practically), so we went for the adobada line.  I was able to order my tongue (lengua) tacos here too and 1/2 order of campechana fries (half carne asada & half adobada).  The adobada meat was the best--not spicy at all.  Sometimes this meat, also known as \"al pastor\" is spicy or flavorless.  The fries were really good, but we got full from the tacos---reheated this the next day & it was still good (just took off the guacamole & sour cream before taking it w/me).  It was a little over $20 for 6 tacos, 1/2 order of fries/ & a drink.  My husbad said that I know how to pick the best places to eat!!!  This place gives King Taco a run for their money.  I love the green salsa from King Taco & give the salsa 5 stars, but the meat from El Gordo has more flavor & the portions are larger.  Lots of Mexican people eating here, so you know it's good when a food place is packed with it's own people. The customer serivce here is superb---really friendly & helpful. Lots of locals eating here....  *Will probably visit this place every time I go to Vegas.",

So when I saw this place on yelp I immediately yelped out and told my mom we must try this place. I was rushing her to get back to Vegas so I could try it. Good thing they close at 3:00 am because most places closed at 9:00 pm and this was one of the only ones open. When I got here I had to have some carne asada fries and a al pastor taco. So after ordering I sat down with my family to eat. Oh heads up the Jamaica drink mixed with sprite and fresh squeezed lime juice is amazing. So after we ate, we decided to just sit a little while and people watch. Well around 12/1 o'clock the crowd started coming and lines were out the door. After a while we left. But overall the food was good and the prices were reasonable. Will be coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Very good ambience. Loved the place",

You have to stand in line for each type of taco you would like to order and that can take a while to get your tacos, but this place is completely worth the wait. I frequent this place almost every week. If you want the True experience of Mexican cuisine make sure you get everything on your tacos. They will ask you if you want everything on it. My personal favorites here are Adobada (spicy pork) and carnitas. The adobada isn't too spicy and has wonderful salsa and creamy guac on them. Don't go anywhere else if you are looking for the best authentic Mexican food in town!",

    "text": "Honestly, all you need to know is that these tacos are HELLA good!!! Meat grilled fresh right in front of you, no pre-made meat sitting for house trying out. Tortillas made fresh in front of you and they aren't skimpy on any of it. Was in Vegas 4 days and had to stop by twice for some Carne Asada Tacos with everything on it!  The meat is soo flavorful, what else could you ask for?? I tried a Mula with Carne Asada the first visit if this trip and it was DELICIOUS!! to me it was a Quesadilla but with meat and all the fixins!!!!!! At $2.50 a taco, you can't go wrong here!! Just understand, the lines are usually long, but go quick. Also, if you want multiple types of meat, I'd suggest going in a group to conquer the line! LOL or be simple like my cousins and I and order all Carne Asada  LOVE THIS PLACE. Will always be a stop when I touch down!",

To a point where no matter what time of the day you go the line is out the door. Not only is the line out the door, it can extend 2x as long as the line inside.   They used to have 2 kitchens in the restaurant so there would be 2 lines. However they have recently expanded the seating area inside and minimized it down to 1 kitchen. They did also shut down for a few months a few years ago. It may have some reason to do with why they took out their seating in front of the store and removed the kitchen. But now they are up and running again and giving the people of Las Vegas more delicious tacos.  There are multiple lines that once you get inside depending on what type of meat you are craving. I always end up in the adobada line. I have not tried any other meat since I've been going there and it's been well over 5 years. I should try more but I can't resist the rotating meat on a stick. Also don't forget to ask for grilled peppers and green onions in the kitchen !",

The gyro like al pastor meat and marinated asada meat, plus all the special sauces, are what make this a standout. I also loved the radishes and lime slices to put the finishing touches on.

HOWEVER, the order of ordering (awkward to say) can be improved. You go in and order your food which is ready pretty much immediately. Then you have to wait in a long line to pay for it, as your food is in your face, getting cold. The tacos (I ordered Pastor) were delicious but small and go for $2.25 each. I wanted to order the carne asada fries but it seems way to expensive for what it was. If I'm in Vegas again I might give it a second go.",

They have this system where they have about 4 lines. Each consisted of the different types of meats depending on what you wanted. You got your most popular which is asada, al pastor and others which include cabeza, tripas, Lengua, etc.  don't really understand this I think it creates a lot of confusion and with not let you get the food you really want. Example, if I want asada and al pastor I have to get in line twice!  So aside from waiting 45 minutes in line to even get inside of the establishment, I have to wait another 30 minutes before I even order my asada tacos, then move over to the next line to get my al pastor which would be at least another 15 minutes.   Why not create another system where it is easy to order and get all of the tacos you desire instead of waiting an hour and half to get your food?   Anyways, would I come again to order sub par tacos and wait a long time? No. Too much hype",

Now I've been with my friend to Mexico to visit family so I trust his tastes. And man wow, amazing!   -Adobada was flavorful and moist.  If you love creamy green sauce you'll like this taco. I thought it was a little too much and took away from the flavor of the meat but the sis loved it. -Lengua (mind you I don't eat Lengua - tho I'll eat Yakitori tongue) was so tender and just melted in my mouth. -Suadero, I've had before at El Taurino in LA but man, the Suadero here is delicious.    The Mulas is quite greasy, I mean HELLA greasy so I'm not sure if that's your thing. I would just stick to the tacos to appreciate the meat. I didn't really see much of a difference between that and a quesadilla.  They close at 5am on Friday (we didn't even notice, we just assumed it was 24hrs).  Most of the workers are OK in English but the main cashier can help explain to you whatever you want.  Be sure to ask for the grilled green onions. So amazing, just like in Mexico!",

However, I think I've tasted better tacos in SD.   - Spicy pork tacos- it was just alright as it did not have enough flavor. Spiciness was mild. - Lengua (beef tongue) fries- meat was very tender which was nice, but didn't find the combo to be that tasty.",

Go in and pick a line according to the meat you want. Doesn't matter if you want a burrito, taco, quesadilla, or fries. From there being your tray to the cashier to pay. Also don't save seats until you are done paying for your food, or just leave your kids at the seats. They no longer have the outdoor patio so seats are limited. Overall great place. Probably the best Mexican food in Vegas. Go there you won't regret it",

These Taco Shops are usually always busy but this location in particular is ALWAYS packed because it's on the strip, especially after midnight.   The quesadillas are to backflip for! they crisp the tortilla, melt the cheese and add meat-SO DELISH!...try everything you can possibly fit in your tummy!",

I'm a fan of King Tacos in LA, a 24hr taco joint with great lengua among other stuff, and had not found a comparison in Vegas.  So i dropped by there last week and ordered a lengua, carne asada and of course the adobada tacos, chasing them all with an iced horchata.  Mucho delicioso is all i would say! Very entertaining as well to watch the guy carve up the adobada and dressing it up so colorful with pineapple, salsa and this creamy green sauce.  Do ask for the grilled jalapenos and green onions to bombify the tasty tacos!   I have yet to try the very sinful looking carne asada fries, but since fries is my lil addiction i'll just bring a unsuspecting friend next time and get help trying the tasty treat.  I'm definitely a fan and will bring my friends there to cure their late night alcohol induced cravings~",

I got the small order and glad I did because the large would have been way too much.  Let me tell you, TEG is some straight up Mexican food goodness! I love this place. The lines were crazy, it was hot in there, families squished in together at the small tables, people hollering across each other - I loved it! And I will be back now that I know where it is. For the past three trips to Vegas, I would make the effort to get to TEG, but could never \"see\" it.  It is in a sort of strip mall with a small parking lot.  This time, I rode around twice before I spotted it.  And I was rewarded with some really good eats.  (This review was from my July 2013 trip)",

You guys don't even get a star. You guys get a FART from me. You get a star because yelp made me do it. I give it to........ THE HORCHATA.  I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so it was packed. Understandable. I love this place so much I chose to wait the 35 min for my tacos... TWICE!!  One of the things that baffled me was how the ADOBADA HANDLER was slicing the meat, and instead of this delicious meat going on the taco as he's slicing it, HE LET IT FALL ONTO THIS TRAY WITH THE REST OF THE MEAT THAT HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. And this meat kept cooking on this tray. -____-  WHYYY??? please tell me why you would do that???   The right way? from the rotisserie into the taco  ROTISSERIE INTO THE TACO !!! not rotisserie to heat griddle... all the juices...GONE!!!   The cheese on my MULA was burnt -_______-  Is it because they're busy??? No that makes no sense!! People are already waiting anyways !!  The other thing that almost made me cry was the ONIONS... They mass cook the onions so when you ask for them they are already soggy and taste more of oil than anything else :_(   Chula Vista location cooks the onions to order so they're fresh, delicious, and tasty.  I wondered once again if this was because they were extra busy but... NO because people wait either way!! So why not serve quality over you guys being lazy and mass cooking onions in quantity??  The only thing I had from here was ADOBADA... which made me sick and I had such a bad stomach ache last night I cried.  This place is not Tacos el Gordo I'm sorry.",

I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place.   The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos. The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it. The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!  I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people. It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green \"crack\" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.  The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10. For vegas, this is great, cheap food. I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends.",

Food: the carne asada vampiro was very good. A vampiro is similar to a tostada, one on top and one at the bottom like a sandwich. I also ordered a taco de tripa, it was salty and so overly fried. Not good! I let the chef know and he offered me a different taco. The carne asada taco was good, the tortillas are homemade. Service: The payment process is a little confusing. After you order and get your food you have to walk across the room with your food to pay. There's signs asking people to sit at a table after getting the food due to limited tables, But not everyone follows the rules so you are left with food and no table. I would eat here again but only if there is no line, it's not worth a 45 minutes wait.",

He followed her back to the counter and she told him he owed $61 and wouldn't give him any napkins until we paid. He again told her we paid. She asked for the receipt so she could see what we paid for. The amount of napkins she gave us depended on how much food we bought. WTH?!?

    "text": "After Baker to Vegas this weekend, my husband and I hit this place up for a good and cheap dinner.  We were covered in dust and looked like desert rats, but the mixture of clientele at Tacos El Gordo was less than judgmental and I felt quite welcome.  The restaurant (on a Saturday night around 8ish) was brightly lit and chaotic with patrons.  The long lines meant a long wait, especially for adobada, which is much, much better than the carne asada, which is good but not great.    The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.    Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says \"Ole!\"  The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.  Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.  However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the True definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.  This is a good place.",

We had the taco de lengua (beef tongue), quesadilla de lengua, taco de asada (beef)-even had a tablespoon of guacamole, taco de tripa (tripe), and taco de adobada (spicy pork).  My favorites were the beef and tongue tacos.  The beef tongue was so tender and tasty.  And the tortillas are freshly made in the tortilla presses and then cooked right while you watch.  Awesome fresh food!  You can even ask for grilled green onions and jalapenos!  Compared to the taco served at the Wicked Spoon buffet the night before, these tacos rocked and were so much more satisfying, cheaper and tastier.  I'll definitely go back here when we're in Vegas.",

This taco joint has different lines for different types of meat. This place does not serve chicken, only beef and pork.  My friend told me to order some adobada tacos. The line was fairly long but after 30 minutes I was finally able to place my order. I ordered four adobada (marinated pork) tacos. The guy sliced up the juicy meat right in front of me. Once you receive your food, you pay for the food at the cashier on the side.  The tacos were juicy and tasty. When you see meat on a spit, you know the meat is fresh and cooked well. Don't forget to ask for the hot sauce!   Overall, this place is great. The only down side is the wait. This place is walking distance from Wynn, so expect the place to be packed late night. At two dollars a taco, I couldn't ask for more. You are definitely getting quality meat at this taco joint. Will come back next time I'm in town! BTW, place closes at 5AM on the weekends!",

    "text": "So I finally got a chance to sneak in here before this place go's off the charts with lines out the door,naturally I have been waiting for this opportunity for a while because usually when you go by this place it looks like they are giving away free cash. I have to be honest I don't get the hype with this place. Its not bad its just not all that. First thing is whats up with the multiple lines,in Los Angeles where I was born and raised and has some outstanding Mexican food,people walk in and order a variety of different meats from ONE LINE. When this place gets crowded who is actually going to wait in several lines in order to get what they like? RIDICULOUS ! I ordered 4 al pastor,I asked how much they were and the guy says its on the menu,um  well i must be going blind because al pastor was not on the menu. The tacos were average,price wise was ok,I found the meat to be dried out and tougher then taco y taco,The seating was extremely limited I was lucky there were not many people there and I was lucky to find a seat. I would have liked to have tried several varieties but i dont care if its meat from the fountain of youth im not waiting on another line for a taco,not worth it to me. Its pretty clear this is a very popular spot and if i owned it I would be thrilled,but as a customer It didnt exactly blow my hair back. Vegas is known as sin city...they should change it to over-hyped city..along with places like lotus of siam or shake shack...lots of hype little delivery. as a side note they have cabeza on the menu,firstly who wants to munch on cow head,YUCK! second I couldent get this rhyme out of my head from when I was a kid,went something like loco loco in the cabeza....lol",

We had most of our group scout out tables while my mom and I ordered for everyone, but it was too hot and crowded to sit inside. Besides, who wants to sit around a bunch of drunk, half naked kids coming back from the day clubs? The service is friendly and fast. We pretty much ordered once around the menu, except for the fries, paid at the counter across the establishment, and ate out of the back of the car. For two people- 6 tacos, 2 mulas, and 2 drinks it was $28, pricey for a taco joint, but it is Vegas. Everything was good and maybe I'm biased, but the quality is much better in San Diego. Avoid this place when you see the line wrapped outside, just come back another time.",

So I think that it was very smart of the El Gordo owners to have opened this shop here. I cam here in the wee morning and everything was pretty organized. It was crowded for the wee morning.. but this is on the Strip. So no surprise there.  I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac? Not sure but I think this is what makes El Gordo special. The pork was season great and it's always nice to see a traditional taco place with their pork rotating on its skewer in front of the fire.  I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.  My experiences with tacos have come a long way because of LAs vast offerings. I still prefer the traditional hand made tortillas and taco carts from the streets of Highland Park in LA.",

Maybe it's because my family is from a different mexican state, but the quesadillas were pretty small and simple. And the tacos were Ok. I was really hoping for a \"Wow\" experience. They weren't great. I will however give them big props for the guacamole on the tacos! That's a plus you don't get that on just any taqueria.   For 7 tacos, 2 quesadillas and 3 drinks we paid $40. I feel like we got a ripped off. I've gotten better tacos for way less.  Yes, I do understand its on the strip so it has to be expensive. But this place is really over rated.

There's a line outside to make it to the line inside. Of note, if you're only interested in the tacos al pastor, you literally may be able to cut the line outside since usually the inside line for these tacos is empty or short. For the rest of the items on their list you just have to wait on the long line. The sitting area is definitely way too small for the amount of people they serve. You have to scramble to get a seat anywhere, and you will be sitting next to strangers. You pay after you get your order but before you eat. They do take credit cards. The people at the register will give you free hot sauce if you ask for it. Now to the important stuff, the tacos. They're small, street taco size, so get 3-5 per person depending on your appetite. They're served on two thin corn tortillas which do not taste freshly made unfortunately. I only tasted the al pastor tacos (spicy pork). The meat was ok, a bit on the dry side perhaps, depending on where it was cut from. They're dressed with cilantro, onions, salsa and a light green sauce (not sure if it was avocado based). They'll add pineapple if you ask for it. Overall, it was an interesting experience but I wouldn't say they're the best tacos I've had.",

    "text": "For the Strip, this is a pretty good option for food. It's a bit out of the way (like a mile from the center of the Strip) and compared to the trucks that abound around LA, the price is high (about $2+ for a tiny taco with only one tortilla if my memory serves me correctly, while LA trucks use two), but the flavor is pretty darn yummy. Try out a few including the cabeza (cow's head), which is tender as can be. The al pastor on the other hand is tasty but a bit overdone. My co-eater pal like the crispiness of the meat--and I can always appreciate meat cooked to the point where I can't feel the fat, but this made it a bit tough to eat... I prefer a little more tenderness.   Bottom line: Compared to the mediocre buffets all over the Strip that cause you to indulge to your stomach's limits, this is a quick and easy place to eat just enough while getting some bang for your buck.",

    "text": "Cheap, fast, taco place. $2.00 street tacos, $4 quesadillas, and $5 half order fries (with meat) or $10 for full order. OK, so $2.00 isnt exactly CHEAP for street tacos, but this is near the strip and nothing else is that cheap around the area. i had the spicy pork taco which was good and we shared the half order of fries with pork. i dont know what kind of creamy white sauce they put on the fries, but it was really good.   the best part of the experience was the lady helping us with our order. you're suppose to just walk up to the counter and order from the cooks, but one of the ladies came up and asked us if we needed help ordering. she explained almost the entire menu to us (which is pretty small) but as indecisive as i was, she was very patient with me and waited until i finally decided on my ONE taco.  the worst part of the experience (this is more for the BF), is that he had an upset stomach later that night from his two tacos and fries. :(",

It's a short scooter ride away from the house, I bring all friends and family here when they visit. Plus e z parking minus so busy during munchie hours.

    "text": "oh Tacos El Gordo, you definately take me back to the days when I was 18 and partying in Tijuana, Mexico!!   Love the tacos although I normally stick to the carne asada and adobado (con todo) and the quesadillas are AMAZING! The quesadillas are different than how I remember- they have a tortilla (corn or flour) and then the cheese and meat of choice, then they had a crunchy fried tortilla on top!   Another menu item I love is the adobada fries(half size)- I'm not one hundred percent sure what the green sauce is but its delicious!   My friend Tony tried the lengua, cabeza, and tripe and he thinks that the cabeza should be \"highly recommended\"  Needless to say, everytime I go I overindulge and have to hit the gym hard to compensate lol  **I truly wish it were a 24 hour establishment, but then again maybe its a good thing it's not!  **also- BRING CASH for tips! there are tip jars all along the counter for the people who are slaving away cooking these food coma-inducing treats!",

They have many varieties of meat: carne asada, al pastor (adobada) , tripe, beef tongue or lengua, etc,. A taco is about $2 and 4 or 5 tacos will fill you up.   I always get their al pastor tacos with everything on it. The sauce that they put in the al pastor tacos are absolutely fantastic!! I also tried their al pastor fries and it is amazing as well. I did try the carne asada fries and it wasn't as stimulating to my taste buds as the al pastor.   Overall, the food is great! however, the lines can be ridiculous. They have different lines for different meats. So, if you want to have different types meats for your food, you should bring a friend of two so they can each stand in a separate line to order all the meats at once.   They used to have a patio outside where everyone can sit and enjoy themselves, but i think they recently renovated because the patio is gone and the sitting area is now inside but it is ridiculously small. This place gets jammed pack and there are not enough tables up for grabs for people to be able to sit and enjoy their food.",

Walking in it's kind of confusing to figure out but basically you have to line up by station to order each kind of taco. Inefficient and confusing yes, but you learn quickly.   My advice: head for the offal station on the right. Rarely a line as white people think it's gross. Cabeza, lengua, buche, tripa, now that's the sh*t I dream about after.   This is also the 1st taco joint I've been to that makes the tortillas fresh in front of you with a press!   For under $10 for 4 tacos I can guarantee you that you won't find a better deal in Vegas.

Expect to wait at least 40 minutes to an hour (if you're lucky) in line to get your tacos.  Once you get in, you will see three lines.  Depending on what type of tacos you want, stay in that line.  It's a lot easier if you have more than one person in your party so you both can order.  They have lime and radishes to take as well.  After you get your tacos, you go and pay for your food.  We ordered it to go and sat in the car to eat it since it was so crowded inside.  I was very pleased by the quality and taste.

The lines are long. The food is not good. Not a fan. I got the asada fries and they didn't meet my expectations. Consider I eat asada fries a lot. This are by far the worst. The meat has no flavor, and put big chunks of meat. The carne asada fries were $14. That's absurd. They should be more like $7 if anything. So I order my fries, & the cook says they'll give them to you on the other side after waiting there for 5 min. So I went to the other side to wait. I was waiting for 10 min when he says your fries are up there. He put the fries in the middle of a busy line. How was I supposed to go through the middle of the people. He could've hand them to me where I was. It was super hot inside and the ordering and paying  Process is confusing. They need a better plan. $2.25 for a taco is a little pricey. The only taco I liked was el pastor. My friend purchased a quesadilla that had like a teaspoon of cheese. It looked like a plain taco. Overall, I would Not come here again.",

    "text": "I pass by this place EVERY day on the way to work and I've always been curious if it was good or not. My Dad and I even stopped in once, but the place was packed and there were several lines arching throughout the restaurant, so we walked out in favor of the Riviera food court, which is NEVER busy.  This time around, the joint was practically dead. I quickly found out that you don't go to the desk with the cash register first, but straight up to the counter in front of the kitchen. I ended up ordering the Taco El Adodaba (Spicy Pork), the Taco Asada (Steak) and a Asade Quesadilla. With a bottle of water, the bill roughly came out to $11 or so.  I am a VERY plain eater when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I usually am the person who will order a burrito with only meat, cheese, rice and maybe potatoes inside. These tacos were slathered with guacamole, onions and salsa. I did remove the copious amounts of guacamole, but I actually thought the combination of all of the toppings and the meat tasted pretty good! That's saying something when a plain person like myself can enjoy such loaded food.  This joint is a little bit different in the fare you would expect from a Mexican place as well. They don't have rice, beans or chips...and the quesadilla is definitely different than ANY other place I've had one before. I can only describe it as a small tortilla with meat and cheese in the middle with a corn chip on top of it. It was different, but not bad at all.",

The only real problem I have with it is their line system; they have three lines, for different types of meat. SOMETIMES you are able to request that they get you meat from the other 2 stations when you get to the front of your line, but if you're looking to get tacos de cabeza, lengua and asada all together you may have problems.  Other than that, there is no reason NOT to go here if you have a car or are staying at Wynn/Encore adjacent. Cheap meal with more satisfaction than most of the Vegas hotel spots.",

One of these things would be to walk up to the carnitas that's slowly cooking at Tacos El Gordo and take a big bite out of it.  I imagine the workers would tried to restrain me, and as this is happening, I would attempt a second bite out of the pineapple on top.    This is a hidden gem on the strip (maybe not so hidden since there are so many reviews??)  I came here in the middle of the day on Wednesday and had 5 tacos.  2 Carnitas (of course), 2 Carne asada, and a chorizo (this is great, I feel like it goes unnoticed amongst other things).  I also ordered the nopales (cactus).  I think vegetarians would really appreciate this dish.  They serve the tacos with grilled green onions.  Parking was easy but it was a random hour.  I can't imagine what happens to this place on a weekend night.  Good job Tacos El Gordo.  You have a funny name (translates to Tacos The Fat).  But I will return regardless of your silly name.  Adios muchachos!!!",

There's different lines for different meats and if u accidentally get in the wrong line, because it isn't really obvious that u have to stand in a certain line for specific food, you may be turned away and asked to stand in a much longer line. It's ridiculous. We sat inside and every time you need to refill your drink or get napkins, whatever, you have to fight through people waiting in lines. After you order and get your food, it's then you go across the room to pay for it. They're asking for shady people to walk out the door without paying.

I had something that is called a \"Vampiro\" from a street vendor in East LA a few years back and was never the same.  They were some of the most amazing secrets of Mexican food I had never discovered up till then.  Sadly the vendor was robbed at gunpoint, not having enough money to buy new equipment.    It can never be as good as those original Vampiros to me, but thank god I have come across somewhere I can find them now this side of the border.  Just order them, don't even worry about what they are.  I am sure many have given the description in their review.    Also, the al pastor vampiro which are also called adobado.  The line for this meat is long and dedicated given the amazing taste of the meat and you will see the line form behind the giant rotisserrie for the pork, capped off with a whole pineapple on top which allows the juice to drip all over the meat.",

    "text": "First visit back on May 10, 2012.  Food looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.  $2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.  The guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (\"what's the vampiro?\" \"the 'vam-pee-roh,'\" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.  There's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.  The asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.  Tip: learn the side streets (i.e. Paradise Rd), and avoid the terrible traffic.",
