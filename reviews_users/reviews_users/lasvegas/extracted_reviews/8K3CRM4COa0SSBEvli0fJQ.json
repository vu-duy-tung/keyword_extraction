I'm quite addicted to hummus, and theirs is fabulous!   They also make pretty decent specialty drinks.  This place is also great for take-out, but its a bit on the pricey side, yet it gets outweighed when you dine there.",

When we left, he couldn't stop rqaving about how amazing everything tasted. We ordered our meal family style and left licking our plates clean! The restaurant is so well kept, modern, yet still such a cozy atmosphere. And the food... well it's probably the most mouthwatering selection of Mediterranean cuisine in the entire state of Nevada. Above all, the service is fantastic. We had Judy as our waiter and she was so, so wonderful and attentive.   We love Paymon's so much we've decided to hire them for our caterer for our wedding as well!!! So far, the experience has been seamless. Paymon is truly an expert at what he does and it's the one facet of my wedding that I know is going to be a complete success without any hitches! The wedding is two weeks away and I trust that I'm going to get equally glowing reviews from all my guests about the food!!",

But today I figured 'what the heck,' and decided to have dinner in the cafe...  First off, let me tell you that this place is like the Olive Garden of Mediterranean food. And by that, I mean everything looked and tasted as if it was prepared hours ago and had been sitting in a kitchen waiting for the rush to come in.  Possibly reheated. I dont know, but every dish I ordered reminded of  the cheap quality dishes you find at food chains like Sizzler or Applebees. Seriously, I love paymons for their hookah lounge but the quality of their dinner food was very very very disappointing. Stick to the hookah, get food somewhere else.",

I can't give it 5 stars because of the price, $20 seems a little to high for hookahs.  However, if you go on Tuesday nights, hookahs and drinks are half off. If you're in summerlin, this is the perfect place to go on Tuesday nights.  Also try the flaming saganaki, it's delicious (though it's weird my browser/Yelp thinks saganaki is a misspelling)",

    "text": "Overall I think that this restaurant offers great value in terms of their portions and their pricing. One person can easily have lunch their for under $15 and leave being extremely stuffed. However, I would not recommend this place if you were looking for legit mediterranean (Italian/Greek) cuisine, since items at this restaurant are fairly Americanized. Likewise, it is probably because many of the dishes are already so westernized that majority of the customers would enjoy their flavours (some people don't like actual greek flavours). Overall, if you're looking for something legitimately Mediterranean, this might not be the restaurant for you, but if you want something INSPIRED by Mediterranean cooking, I think this would be an excellent place to try out.  I would love to return to this place if I ever return to Vegas!  PS. Order small, b/c things come in big portions. When I went I didn't have enough room to try desert even though I wanted to :( .",

    "text": "We were recently introduced to the mysterious world of the hookah.  While looking for a happy hour on a recent visit to Vegas we stumbled on Paymons. I absolutely adore this place. From the minute we stepped into the hookah lounge we were welcomed and felt at home. If you want to spend a couple of hours chillin' in an exotic atmosphere eating Mediterranean food--we're talking here fried calamari and baba gnoush served with a huge side of soft pita bread--while sipping any specialty drinks. . . ours were a variation of the margarita, at happy hour half price--this is your place.  And, hey maybe add a hookah to the mix.  The lounge is dark, sultry and cozy. The decor is \"Persian Sultan den\" with walls and ceiling a deep warm maroon.  A selection of large paintings of women in suggestive poses from past centuries sit in ornately carved frames vying for space with heavily-patterned cloth tapestries which gives the room a tent-like atmosphere. There are plenty of pillows to lounge upon. My wife said, \"we need to create a hookah den in our house.\" I said, \"sure, I'm in.\" At first I was curious why the music wasn't traditional Middle Eastern, but I soon warmed up to the House music, which surprisingly suited the space.  The server/bartenders had no attitude whatsoever and made me want to spend a long time here. The hookah master gently asked us if we would like to try a hookah. He said he would mix a special novice blend for us. We wondered if his watermelon/grape recommendation would be too fruity, but the concoction had a smooth taste and aroma and I felt myself relaxing with every puff. The crystal ball says there is a heartier mix for me to try next time.",

There was 1 (yes you read correctly 1) waitress/ bar tender for the whole lounge on. Which wasn't terribly crowed but not empty either.  I ended up busing our table after having it be full of dirty dishes for over a half an hour.

The second night we tried the thief flavor, which was my personal favorite of the two; which again, didn't hit too hard, but did taste very good. At some point in the night, I felt we needed new coals for our hookah, and the waitress told me they don't change coals, you have to buy a new refill for coals which to me is a little ridiculous (and that's an understatement). The music they play is a combination of reguaetton, cumbia, and top 40's. I actually enjoyed the music a lot. Also, on Friday nights they have a dance floor availible. I didn't go about trying the food, but if I do come back, I might just do that.  Overall; to me, this place is more bark than bite, it has a very well decorated lounge, and has fair hookah. The customer service isn't terrible, but I can see them doing more fir the customer.",

    "text": "This is another place that the company eclipsed the food, IMO...Wifey and I split the Lamb Burger and Athens Fries which seems to be a favorite among lots of reviews.  I also ordered a Falafel gyro because I haven't had a good Falafel in a while. Don't know if the size of our party was a concern, but when our food arrived, it looked good, but sadly, the taste fell short. The burger itself was pretty good, but the bun was pretty hard, a sign of it being toasted WAY ahead of time. Same with the Falafel, it had a thicker than usual crispy shell(little too long in the fryer?) and was just okay.  The Fat Greek serves up a much tastier Falafel Gyro, as well as the ones at Amena. You want \"crack\" Fries? Head down to Greek Bistro in Henderson and taste them for yourself...ALOHA!!!",

Happy Hour is 5-7pm and is only offered in the lounge area. That means you get a ton of food at a great deal!   Veggie dolmas are good so is the baba, hummus, falafel...I don't care for bread (any bread) so they bring me sliced cucumbers to dip instead.   We have always had great service. I can't think of any complaints at all. They even keep an eye on our coals and are always refilling water (the tap they serve is horrible for some reason here). They check up on you without being annoying.   Order some Skittles hookah, pig out, drink some yummy tea, and relax.",

Tonight I needed more protein so I tried the steak kabob and that was delicious, but I still had to take part of it home because of the crack fries.  I think Paymon's Athens fries are the best thing ever, which is not a good thing for my arteries, but once in a while I do indulge.  Everything I've had here is good and we never have to wait for a table.  It's a reliable go-to for good food and good service. PS--They have baklava, my fave!",

The falafel might be the best falafel I've had- although I wanted chopped white onions and  they only had red.  I had to ask for more Tahini sauce to bring it to my taste.  My brother said the gyros were good,  but needed more sauce as well.   For dessert we had the rice pudding with whipped cream and cinnamon: excellent!    If I had it to do over again, I would order basmati rice instead of the fries.   We had a Greek salad which was just fair- mostly lettuce. ;(  All in all, a fine experience & I will eat there again.",

Last 2 time were a total bust. We ate here tonight. The Greek salad, the lettuce leaf edges were turning brown.  The Hummus was not fresh, it too was brown on the edges like Tuna salad when left uncovered turns. Worst of all. We ordered a Chicken Kabob dinner. The chicken came out raw in the center and had to be sent back. The kabob seemed to have been cooked on a grill. It did not have any char. Second time we ordered a Chicken Kabob here in the last two weeks and the chicken was like a hard rubber. It was gross and we left it. Amazing how long this restaurant was great and all of a sudden its getting really bad. I do not know if Paymon is  still is the owner. He and his father were some of the best owners of any establishment in town. Very generous to their patrons when at their market they had on Maryland pkwy, and the food was always fresh and prepared perfect. If they still own it, they need to get more hands on, because their manager and cooks are doing them a great disservice. I have to start looking for another Mediterranean restaurant. Two bad meals in a row has me gun shy.",

All of their specialty cocktails, wines by the glass, and mixed drinks are half off. $4 will get you a Babylon Spice. One cannot go wrong with a mixture of ginger and coconut milk. It is rather heavy and I can only drink one before going to something else, but it is a nice starter drink.   This night, my friend and I ordered the falafels, dolmas with meat, Athen's fries (or better known as crack fries), babaganoush, and a pesto pizza with mushrooms and bell peppers.

I hate to sound so harsh but honestly I've been here four times thinking each time that next time would be better, but I'm done trying. They need to make it so the coals aren't covered...I know there's a liability, but it really destroys the quality of the smoke and flavor when you have the cover on the coals...they're the only place I know of in Vegas that does that.

Paymon's has two locations: one by UNLV and the other in the Northwest part of town (the Sahara location definitely has less criminal activity and is therefore my favorite one). Surprisingly, it's actually pretty classy inside and I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is. Upon walking in, I was pleased to see that both locations are beautifully decorated in a Moroccan style with gorgeous pillows and dimly lit lanterns that make me feel like I'm in Aladdin. Come here to hang out with friends, unwind after work, have a few drinks and just relax.  Even the food is pretty tasty. Mostly locals frequent Paymon's, so it's safe to say that the chances of a tour bus packed full of foreigners unloading there are slim.   The hookah flavors choices are wide but my favorite by far is green apple.  It's amazing how real it tastes!  AND its calorie free. If you're hungry for real food, don't miss the Athens fries, which are awesome and an order of hummus and pita bread.",

They were so good i was tempted to order a second dish of it... we also shared a panini and fries that were off the hook!  Salad was also yummers!!

(Also..the red hot sauce, and the Greek dressing is delicious..and is for sale in the restaurant... YUM!!! I love the Hookah lounge at the Sahara location..and I love the outdoor courtyard at the Maryland spot. I think they would be more respected if they didn't offer  italian food... keep it \"mediterranean...\" Just my opinion.  Also... they have delicious iced tea.. their \"adult beverages\" are pricy, and again...the hookah lounge... well, its pretty fab.",

The falafels were seasoned just the way I like them, the sauce made it slightly sweet and tasted like it had a hint of cinnamon, the sauce went perfect with the falafel. The gyro meat was tender, flavorful and not in the least greasy, it was exactly how it should be. Plus they have a ton of vegetarian and vegan options it seems, I feel all the vegetables we got were quality and deliciously fresh. My boyfriend raved over the Athens fries, they were quite good!",

I'm usually really into pomegranate concoctions, so I was sold as soon as I read the description. To be honest, I enjoyed it thoroughly, but it was a tad too sweet.  I also had their Passion Fruit Iced Tea. I remember having that last time and it is definitely my go-to drink whenever I return. On a side note, my friend ordered the Chicken Curry. She is hardcore when it comes to spicy food. She asked the waiter to make it as spicy as possible. I tried it and it definitely kicked my butt.  Paymon's has a lot of charm. The servers are extremely accommodating and friendly. When they say Mediterranean, they mean it. I always thought they were primarily Persian, but they offer Greek, Italian, and I'm sure other cuisine styles that I haven't bothered to identify.  It's not a place I would go to often. However, I would never hesitate whenever someone makes the suggestion.",

My buddy found a 1 inch piece of steel wire brush, the type you would use for pots and pans in his gyro.  We brought it to the attention of the server.  Without expecting anything free, the gyro should have been comped and at least an apology.  Nothing.  Followed up with a complaint to their corporate office.  Manager finally apologized with the excuse that our server was a nice guy but not very intelligent.  Next time we could receive a comp dinner for 2.  That's not the point.

Unable to get my legs under the tables and I am not overweight in any manner so not a fat leg problem. 2) I've been here a few times where the owners friend was in per employees so the TV's had to be left on his bet channels and not switched to the VGK games 3) Bar area opens later so if want to watch any sports game they have to start after 5pm",

I knew of Paymon's for many years, but dodged it, assuming the interior would be a worn-out den of teenage hookah iniquity. But actually the venue is actually quite nicely appointed.  I had the Moussaka. My dining companion, she chose the Panini Chicken, and we shared a Calamari appetizer. Service was attentive. Portions were a fair shake, quality is well-above-average.   However, prices were just a wee bit higher than I would deem fair, given what was delivered. I suppose that's where I fished up the one-star ding.  Still, you won't be making a wrong turn in checking this place out.",

But I decided to check it out anyway.  My order came quick.  Which was good, I  didn't have alot of time.  The salad was nice and fresh.  And the falafel was nice and hot.  It came on a bed of lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes?  No flavor or salad dressing on the decoration for the falafel.  But the falafel was delish. The best Falafel I've every tasted.  My waiter was great.  He checked on me, and made sure everything was good.  I would go back, if I had looked at some of the photos on Yelp, I would have tried something else.",

We made reservations at another restaurant for Valentines day and after an hour of nobody taking our order... we left. We came across Paymons since they had vegan options and found our new local spot. Not only do they have FRESH loose leaf tea, which is amazing...their service has gone above and beyond. They have great specials and offers on their mailing list. We have never had to wait, and even when they are a full house...they are able to seat us!   I am not fond of the hookah lounge and that is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because sometimes the only table left is right by the hookah door and the smell makes me sick. I think for business it is a great idea to have a day/night option.   I also love that they have NO TV's ( other than the hookah lounge)  I have noticed great vibes from customers since they are very interactive with each other instead of watching TV.   Amazing vegan options too! ( has Vegan on their menu)",

Not going to lie the happy hour prices are pretty great. Everything is under 5 dollars for food and many drinks and cocktails are half off. Moscow mules are 4 bucks at happy hour!!  Also hookah is half off too so it's 8 dollars for a flavor.   We basically ordered everything off the happy hour menu. My favorite was the calamari. It was good quality crispy calamari with generous proportions. The wings were great as well too. It's only one flavor but I thought they were delicious. Chicken fingers and fries were good too. Pretty standard. I really enjoyed the babaganoush. I thought it had more flavor than the hummus. The pizzas weren't that great. Tasted like frozen pizzas at the grocery store. Dolmas were good but they come covered in tomato sauce I believe. The one item we ordered off happy hour was the Greek salad that was tasty as well too.   The reason why I gave it 3 stars was for the service. I understand the place can get pretty busy but we were always trying to track them down to order stuff or get refills on waters. Also when our bill came, they charged some items full price even when we ordered them before happy hour ended. They were nice enough to correct it but it kind of took forever.   I would definitely come back for happy hour and hookah though. Maybe they can better accommodate smaller groups.",

    "text": "Paymons is one of my favorite places to go with a lot of people because of the amount of variety in the menu. There is Greek, Italian, Persian, Indian, and many more different types of food. There are so many options for vegans, vegetarians, and people with dietary restrictions. I got the hummus as an appetizer. You can ask for cucumbers instead of pita bread or pita chips if you are trying to make it low carb or just prefer vegetables. We also ordered the dolmas, but they have meat in them so I didn't eat them. For my entree, I ordered the Greek salad which was very good! I would definitely go back and order it again. The service was great. They also have a hookah bar for people 21+ and serve alcohol. The hookah bar is connected to the restaurant, but there is a door that separates the two.",

She didn't warn me these \"didn't count\" for happy hour. I get my bill and I'm paying full price for everything but saved $2 on fries. :| so I ask a different lady (my waitress is once again nowhere to be found, and she legit told us earlier in the night she doesn't know how to set up or upkeep the hookah bowls) why I'm paying $60 instead of the $30 I expected, and she informed me bottles don't count and hookah happy hour ends at 7... but I got there at 8:15 and they told me hookah was half off. :| sorry for the rant, but inform your employees about your services, seriously. I've been hoodwinked, and had to give our horrible (I'm guessing she's new) waitress a bigger tip than she deserved because I had to give at least 15% of $60 instead of $30. No chill.

We came here because it was highly recommended to us by a friend - which I will never trust again.   The food was...not good. It was a notch below mediocre...  We started off with the combo appetizer platter - the only thing that was good was the dill sauce. Everything else was okay and somewhat bland or over-fried.   For dinner, we had -  Chicken Curry - Man, I don't know what they use in this curry other than some kind of bland curry and nutmeg. It wasn't even very spicy as I requested. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish my dish...even though I was hungry.  Also, they use precooked basmati rice...??? I don't understand any restaurant that uses precooked rice. I'm half Asian. I know when rice isn't fresh. I eat that shit every day.   Lamb, beef and chicken kabobs - same thing. That rice...oh, that rice. And the kabobs were alright. I give them 3 stars. But, they were not that pleasing to the taste buds.   I don't know. The server was good, but very oddly quiet...like we had to listen in very closely to hear what he was saying. He was prompt though.   I do not recommend this place. It's outdated and maybe it was good at one time. If so, they've taken a turn for the worst. There are many other places in town that beat out this place, hands down.",

    "text": "I love falafel, but I never get to have it.  Greg always chants, \"Falafel is awful.\"  Partly because he likes the rhyme, partly because he knows it annoys me, and partly because he hates falafel.  I was super excited when he suggested Paymon's for lunch.  He tends to avoid Mediterranean restaurants, because he always says, \"Isn't that whole area a little iffy?\"  Paymon's serves what I think of as non-threatening food from a foreign country.  Nothing is very strange, falafel is perhaps one of their stranger things on the menu.  Everything is amazingly overpriced.  Greg had the pastitsio, which is basically bland Greek lasagna, something that I could never get excited about.  (Apparently, this is no longer on the menu).  I had the falafel which had really large patties.  I prefer my patties smaller and crispier.  The fries were just superb though.  I could go to Paymon's for just the fries with their strange mustard like fry sauce.  The thing that pissed me off though is when we ordered a pot of tea.  They have a great selection of tea to order from, but when we asked if we could split a pot of overpriced tea, we were informed that it wasn't allowed.  Really?  Everyone has to get their own POT of tea...not a glass, a pot.  You can't split a pot of tea.  What a joke of a restaurant showing that they really just care about ways to make money!  Paymon's, by the way, is the restaurant that gets called in about on KNPR constantly.  Whenever they have a food critic on, people call in and rave about Paymon's.  It got the point that people at KNPR usually mention that they will not be taking calls about Paymon's and that Paymon's is just all right of a restaurant.  The people that called in about Paymon's apparently were over-enthusiastic employees.",

The d.j. is playing top 40 music and the staff seems scattered,  I'm sure that is natural given the owner presence. As a visitor, I shouldn't have to wait. The staff seems apologetic and concerned but there are reserved spots but nobody sitting there.  Typically this is a great spot to visit when you want to relax and enjoy the evening, the hookah is really great here and the drinks rock too!",

We used to go to the location on Maryland Pkwy and should try it again soon, hopefully they will cook their food the same way as they do here. The Athens fries were good, but not a super favorite in my book. Good service and if you want a cozy hookah experience I guess the next little room across the way is for you. I don't like tobacco, but I do like the food here.  We'll try the location on Flamingo and Maryland since it is closer to where we live.",

I will say, having fresh Athen's fries is a must with their special sauce. They are definitely special.  I had hot green tea with honey and it was delicious :] served in a pot.  Aside from Athen's fries we had calamari for an appetizer which was the fried variety-just how I like! And a big serving for the price of about $10.  I had the Greek Pie.. I forgot the name but the menu read that it had a baked bechamel sauce on top.  Overall it was forgettable. It was served with a side of veggies. Pretty much tasted like a soup.  Someone got the meat kabob gyro which was said to be very good.  And for dessert we shared an unimpressive baklava.  Had take out a couple of weeks later from here and had the chicken Marsala and also had a bite of chicken parmasen.  Helped keep my rating to a 3.  Our server was great but it ends with the food which was meh.   Big complaint is the small tables. Sooo annoying when the plates are so big.",

The pita was good, but the bottom was pure lettuce, no sauce or anything. The sauce up top was good too. Kind of tasted like a spicy peppercorn or spicy Bleu cheese (idk). The gyro platter was okay. Salad was really good and the rice. The meat was good, but very grenade. My husband couldn't eat it all because of that. Otherwise, it was pretty decent for our first trip there. I also like the fact the hookah area is separate from the dining area. Good idea!!",

    "text": "Hello from Japan!  For those following my reviews, I am Yelping from Sendai city in beautiful Miyagi prefecture (two hours north of Tokyo).  I am working here as an ALT, so I'm going to be here for a while.  I'm going to get my last reviews in because I miss Yelp, and wish I could yelp some of the great places I've been to here in Japan.  (Sorry for that tangent... on to the review!)  I came to Paymon's about a month ago when I was supervising a group of international students to Sin City.  Echoing my previous reviews, I find that the best restaurants and treasures in Vegas definitely come from the locals, and it wasn't long before buddy Francis C. took me here for a late lunch.  Paymon's specializes in Mediterranean cafe style foods- a cuisine I've never really touched before, so my choices here were definitely on the safe side.  Conveniently located a few blocks away from the Strip, Paymon's offers a great atmosphere to enjoy a nice meal, as well as a hookah bar right next door (however, you must be 21 or older to enter).  When we went, we sat in between the restaurant and the bar in this extremely nice patio area, where natural sunlight was where it was at.  Service that day was decent.  We placed a few orders of fries, and I ordered the chicken marsala for my hefty meal.  Our food took a bit for it to come out, which confused us because a couple of other parties received theirs before ours (and we felt it was a pretty small meal).  When I finally received my chicken marsala, I was ready to sink my mouth into that piece of chicken.   In terms of the taste, the flavors didn't do much for me.  It wasn't bad at all, but nothing about my meal struck me.  The piece of fried chicken breast was okay, and my sauce over the noodles were simply average.  However, they do give a good sized portion for you hungry gamblers out there.  Even though my meal wasn't completely mind-blowing, I did enjoy the French fries and the on-and-off lighting inside the patio.  Next time I come, I will definitely venture off and try the more Mediterranean options that Paymon's is known for.  Parking is plentiful outside in a private lot with other businesses.",

I've tried many other restaurants and no one even comes close to making hummus like Paymon's.  This visit was great! The food was great as usual and my server was very friendly and attentive to my tables needs.  My friend had the fried calamari, which she highly enjoyed and I had the dolmas stuffed with lamb and side of hummus. It all tasted delicious and was very fresh.  Our bill came to about $32, which I thought was a great price for the amount of food your getting.   If your looking for a nice quiet place on a week day on a tuesday at 5pm this place is perfect. You can dine in for an hour or more, have a nice meal and catch up with a friend.  Overall this place is great and I can't wait to try it again!",

For starters when we walked in most of the little sectionals were already taken but the waitress kindly made some room for me and my girlfriend to chill. Once we were seated we were recommended some sort of hookah flavor. I'm not much of a hookah smoker but I'll do it socially. The flavor we had was good however the hookah they brought us barely worked! We had to ask for assistance at least 3-4 times and the burner was messed up. Bummer.. Took a while to flag down the waitress although she was sweet something was still lacking... On to the drips they have they lyche martini that's great and another drink that's similar to a Long Island! Both good! The recommended gyro came out the first time on some stale bread that I had sent back because there was no explanation as to why when I picked up my sandwich to bite the whole thing crumbled.. Literally at this point I was beyond over the experience.. I can see the poets rial and if I'm being treated I may return...",

We tried three different kinds of hummus (Jalapeno, red pepper, and eggplant.) The jalapeno rated the best 5/5 stars. Red pepper put in the middle 4/5 stars. The eggplant hummus was the worst of them all 1/5 stars. It had an awful smoky flavor that we couldn't finish it. If you go here, enjoy everything else but avoid the eggplant hummus.",

I ordered online (just 1 frickin' sandwich, btw) before I even got driving, because I had limited time & I wanted my order to be ready.  Well, no worries there. Hostess had literally not even put it in yet (at least 25min!!!). Ok. Long deep breath, it'll be ready in 15. Nope. It took an HOUR for a sandwich.   Meanwhile, this bih is taking orders. Is she a hostess or a waitress, cuz I work in f&b and those are distinct jobs. Groups of nicely-dressed people were standing there waiting for tables while she was taking table orders. And she didn't even put them in, I saw that sh*t. She went to go seat people, yanno, like the job description entails. So head's up, the next sandwich turnaround time was likely an hour, too. I'm actually laughing at this point, because this was happening on a Tuesday. Can you imagine a whole table on a Saturday night? I'm a cocktail waitress, so the cringe factor was REAL.  My God. I'mma drive my happy ass to Maryland Pkwy to avoid the sh*tshow. I'dve wasted more gas, but probably would have at least been on time for work.",

    "text": "I have been coming to Paymons on the east side of town for over 10 years now.  Since my parents moved to Summerlin four years ago, we have been happily coming to Paymons on Sahara without issues.  Cannot say that was the case last night.  They were busier than usual, and boy did they have a bad night.  Let me explain.  We were only a party of four and therefore the order should not have been that difficult.  We ordered an appetizer and then the following meals: 1) Kebab Trio 2) Greek Salad 3) Chicken Parm 4) Lamb Kebab  I just did this from memory, so should not be that difficult for person writing it down.  Don't know what happened in the kitchen, but here is how the food came out.  1) Chicken Parm and Lamb Kebab came out to the table and the food runner said they are getting the salad.  Lamb Kebab was cold and tough...salad limp....and had to be sent back.  Chicken parm was good.  Next runner brought the Greek salad in a bag to go.  Ooops....had to be brought back to the kitchen and put in a bowl.  My food....the Kebab trio...a no show.  Waitress was very apologetic and said she would check.  They never put the order in....so I changed the order to a Gyro Platter to make it quick.  Unfortunately after all the mistakes above, they didn't think to put a rush on the Gyro Platter as it showed up after everyone was done.    THE BIGGEST ISSUE I HAVE WITH EVERYTHING, IS THE MANAGER WAS A NO SHOW.  HOW CAN YOU RUN A RESTAURANT, WITHOUT GOOD MANAGEMENT?  I DON'T THINK Paymon Raouf WOULD ACCEPT THIS STYLE MANAGEMENT FROM HIS STAFF?  MAYBE HE SOLD?  They didn't charge me for my Gyro platter, we didn't eat the lamb Kebab, so they took that off the bill.  But the biggest issue is the lack of respect for the customer.  We are a long time client and might give their new competition down the road a try.    Just a disappointment.  Long time patron.",

Their happy hour goes late too, 4-7 pm which is great for people who tend to work late like me. This location is also much bigger then the Maryland one which makes it easier to find a table.   On my most recent visit I decided to go with the traditional hummus, stuffed grape leaves and dolmas. I liked the hummus but felt it could have been a bit for flavorful. The dolmas and grape leaves however were great. The flavors are bold and nicely complimented with a gyro type sauce. I also recommend trying the fries and calamari here!",

Wednesday night 25% OFF  - Arrived 10 min before 5pm they say they would send a server at 5.  - 25 min go by and no one comes to check on our table. Another guests sitting near were also getting impatient  - One more table gets seated, I finally go ask the host to either send a server or move us to a table where the server would come and actually take the order. - Finally a server shows up and apologized she wasn't aware we were waiting... Hmm strange? 4 tables totally unattended for 20-25 min. -Last table gets seated gets their order placed and sure enough they get drinks and food before us.  - Another guests get upset and leave. 5min later the server comes with the drinks and at this point I tell her what was going on.. I said we've been waiting for so long and the last table gets served first obviously someone will get pissed. - Another server comes not sure if it was the supervisor apologized offered to comped our appetizers... Blah blah  - 45 min to get our food when the bill comes, I can't help to notice the appetizer wasn't comped. No reason to bring this up. I'm actually just impatiently waiting to pay and leave.  This people don't really know how to treat and keep your long time clients happy. I've been coming to Paymons for at least 8 years and is disappointing how the service has gotten this way. - Honestly for being Wednesday night it wasn't even that busy. But two slow servers for the whole place..?",

    "text": "This review is strictly for the hookah lounge. I love coming here with a group of friends for some hookah, drinks and occasional food. The decor in the lounge is absolutely stunning and immediately puts you in a loungey, relaxy mood as you take a seat. This place is what I feel a True hookah lounge embodies. All the other ones I've been to around here and Cali have nothing on this lounge. With that said, the one on Maryland Pkwy is the same, just smaller and more narrow in size.  During my many visits here for about the past 10 years, I've had the pleasure of trying a few dishes whilst drinking and smoking in the lounge. Some of my faves here are: moussaka, lamb kabobs, beef kabobs, calamari, Athens fries, hummus, to name a few. I can't remember not liking anything I've tried here.  If you get here during happy hour, the specialty drinks and appetizers are half off. And they do not skimp here. You can order a full size calamari app for under $5 and they are some of the best I've ever had.  The service is always super friendly but they do get overwhelmed when it gets busier at night. This is a fact I've come to live with when visiting Paymon's but the relaxed feel when I'm here makes it a non-issue for me.  Every time I come here, it's always great times and great memories. This is a must-do when I have friends in from out of town. I'm so glad we have such a beautiful place like this in Las Vegas that is off the Strip.",

We had such a great meal and experience here last year that we selected it for our December gathering. I arrived after two of my friends, who had been seated. He ordered the drink special but was told that they were out of the ingredients for that drink. Ran out THAT MORNING. I ordered my fave from last time, the Mangorita....it sucked. Poorly made and nothing like the fine concoction of our last visit.   The rest of the guests arrived and they ordered a scotch neat and a glass of wine. 20 minutes later it was still not there. In the interim, they had taken our dinner order. As the waiter is being addressed about the missing drinks...hardly difficult to prepare...we are informed that they are out of meat balls. An Italian menu that is out of meat balls because....wait for it....THEY FORGOT TO MAKE THEM!!!   We got our meals finally and it was just a disaster after all of that rigmarole. Now the manager comes to speak to one of our group and says he will comp a round of drinks off the bill....well, they defer to the FIRST round ordered which was the first two who arrived, so no, they did NOT comp a ROUND of drinks for the group. Clearly this place has encountered some kind of change. I fully expect it to be featured on Restaurant Rescue it has gotten so bad. They get one star becuse the calimare was great...the rest rated about 100 on teh suck-o-meter.",

    "text": "***3rd updated review: All please note the business manager deleted his reply. (As he should have, as he was extremely rude to my feedback. i will go and post screen shots of his original reply when i get some time.  --------------------------------------------------- ***2nd updated review: Here's an update to my review below. I tried to comment back to Jeff E. from this business but Yelp wouldn't let me for some reason. So this explains why the staff was rude, as you all can see below the Business Manger is rude himself in his reply. Not once, did I get an apology for his staff being rude or making us feel uncomfortable. Note, I am a first time customer and a potential client, obviously he doesn't care. In his review he didn't post about how we where addressed by the bus lady. Our own waiter didn't even enforce the dress code or anything.   And our bad on the \"garlic fries\" when he asked the server about them we where told the following, \"We stopped serving those\" which indicates or conveys you once had them to a new customer like myself. So if you don't serve garlic fries or \"never have\", then please Jeff, educate your staff to let people know that, so they can respond correctly to customers.   If you enforce a dress code regardless of race, or gender then all of your employees should enforce it, not just the bus lady, but your hostess who sat us AND the waiter who served us who said nothing to us. Please understand it felt like we where being picked on because after us sitting there for 2 hours smoking hookah and spending money on drinks no one said anything. I understand the dress code is posted but it was late and dark so we did not see it. Your host, and waiter said nothing to us. It would have been better to be addressed earlier, then 2 hours in, from a bus lady clearing our plates after we are done and about to leave. Please note, unlike the other customer, who was asked to remove his baseball cap \"3 times\" as soon as where we asked we cooperated and removed the hat. The point I am trying to make is we where addressed rudely about the baseball cap. Threated even, \"if we do not remove it we have to leave,\" but the guy across from us is allowed to be asked 3 times and us only once? That is not right.  And I think that that's great you have a way to buy shirts if someone has no sleeves, but if its NOT about race or gender, then why are the females allowed to wear sleeveless tops and sleeveless dresses in there? I myself had a tube top on that night, and no one made me \"pay for sleeves or a shirt.\" If you are going to have a dress code, then all should abide by it then. Not just males. Women should too if that is what the dress code is. But again, it seems this place only caters to the \"regulars\" based the response below that I got. :-/  so I guess it doesn't matter.   ---Old review: My friends wanted to come in for the \"garlic fries\" only to find out they no longer serve them. We sat there for about 2 hours smoking hookah. Then some bus lady out of no where tells my boyfriend \"you need to take off your hat or get out.\" First off, we have been sitting here for 2 hours and now it's an issue? Second of all I understand a dress code but the way she approached us and ask was rude. Simple. I then looked around and saw other people with baseball caps on as well. So we asked if my boyfriend needs to remove his baseball cap then so should the others. The bus lady / clean up lady claims she asked the other guy to remove it 3 times. I find it funny that she can supposedly ask someone to remove a hat 3 times and it's ok. But of course she asked my boyfriend once or her would be \"kicked out\" after 2 hours of sitting somewhere come on. So anyways my guy took off his hat. As we're waiting for our check there was a guy next to us and he had a regular black tee shirt on. They told him He has to have a \"proper shirt on or get out\" they then had him come over to the bar and \"pay a shirt fee\" wtf??!! This place is wayyyyy to worried about baseball hats and plain tees on certain people. If you know what I mean... If you guys are going to have a \"dress code\" it should be the same for everyone. No matter race or gender. Example: they let people in wearing sweats and work out clothes but worry about hats and plain tees? Come on now.",

There was only one girl working the floor, the host stand and answering phones; a bit odd I thought. Doesn't make for great customer service BUT to be fair she did a good job and we never felt ignored or abandoned with empty glasses.   The food as usual, is good. Their lentil soup and Musakka are my favorite.",

First off they \"ran out\" of not just their drink special but also the main dish I ordered.  Second, the service was terribly slow.  We are talking 20 minutes to get a glass of wine.  Third, when this was explained to the manager, he offered to take a \"couple\" drinks off our almost $200 tab, which I will just say was completely inadequate given all the gaffs that went into our meal.  If I wasn't there with a big group I would have walked out  and gone someplace that values my business.  Save yourself some headache by not \"walking in\" to begin with.",

Maybe it was an off night, maybe it was because we arrived toward the end of happy hour, but regardless, it just was okay at best.  I met my friend at the hookah bar, where we were quickly set up with the Disco Lemonade hookah and ordered drinks.  The drinks (apple martini for my friend, lychee martini for myself), were actually quite good, as was the hookah, which was mild and flavorful.  That's where the good stuff ends, though.  Service from that point was a slow and lacking. We ordered 3 dishes: the wings, calamari, and the Athens fries, which took quite awhile to come out, were lukewarm at best, and tasted old- as if they had been sitting out for awhile.  The hookah attendant seemed annoyed that we weren't smoking our hookah fast enough and *gasp* socializing and talking to each other.  When we finished our meal, we asked our waitress for boxes for the leftovers, which she never brought.  No one ever came back to ask if we were done, needed anything else- or even to bring our check.  After waiting for at least 20 minutes, we finally tracked down our waitress at the bar to ask for the boxes and the bill.  The boxes were given to us with annoyance, and after seeing us struggle with them, a bag wasn't offered- luckily, the hostess at the front offered one to us.  I am not sure if I'll give it another chance.  I did like the location, the look of the lounge, but the food and service...as the stars say- \"meh.\"",

Some people in our party were not happy about that and management was not very nice about it. She pretty much said it was a requirement. I understand people make reservations and bail, but don't disrespect paying customers. Then she said they needed a credit card on file to keep the tab open. Usually the restaurant will let you pay as you go or don't require a card. Do that many people walk out that require this scrutiny? We did not feel welcome. On top of that, my friend waited an hour and a half for her Salmon and they made no effort to make her feel better about it. I never have any problems at the Maryland location.

They had a D.J. and a room specifically for hookah which unfortunately was packed so we ended up with a table in the dining area.  Because it was dark and late it ended up being OK (and you can still hear the music). It took about 35 minutes for the Hookah to come to the table, so we had some drinks to wait.   When the Hookah did arrive, it didn't work.  It took another 10 minutes to flag down a server to have her fix it, and then another 10 minutes for a new one to come.  Overall it took about an hour to get our Hookah.  I assumed this was an OFF night and they were understaffed but after reading other reviews it looks as if service is a common issue here. The flavors they offered were similar to other Hookah lounges, we had the \"Skittles\" flavor.    I think the waitress felt bad for the lack of service and a table opened up in the big room (where the DJ is) and asked us if we wanted to move.  It helped that we were a big group of girls I assume.  That experience was much better, if I had to guess the servers are focused more in this room, so if you come here try to get in there!",

Hookah needs serious improvement. Use foil around the bowls instead of the dome, give tongs with it, and offer to change charcoal instead of only one time when you start. Only change charcoal with a refill. Not good. One of the worst hookahs in town as is.",

My medium curry was flavored with a long hair in it. The dolma was a huge disappointment. The leafs were not tightly wrapped, swimming in the tomato sauce with a wilted lemon and it was also flavored with hair. I hate to say it, but they have made their choice to ignore the restaurant and focus on the lounge.... so long to Paymons!!!",

I just get the feeling that no one enjoys working here.  The restaurant is very nicely designed, and they've got the food down pat!

Portions are big and hearty and the fun part about that is you have more opportunities to try new things! I must say, as someone who has been a fan of Greek food for quite some time, it is difficult to find a falafel that is done right. You won't be disappointed with the little nuggets you get here. Crispy, crunchy, and smooth garbanzo texture. No burnt rubbery falafel in this joint! (which is refreshing to say the least). I wasn't particularly impressed with the roasted red pepper pita sandwich, a bit bland but edible nonetheless. One recommendation I do have is the veggie kabob, which features Mediterranean-style veggies grilled to perfection, especially the red pepper, yum!   Came here for the first time the other day and will definitely be back to experience it night-style, hookah and all. If you like Greek food, this place is worth checking out!

They have loose leaf tea which is a plus, but the dinner entrees that myself and the rest of my party ordered were equivalent to overpriced Mediterranean fast food.  Ordered a chicken pita. It was alright, nothing extraordinary. Chicken was a bit dry and there was a lot of it, which explains why the pita was served in a paper wrap with printed instructions on how to eat it, so as to avoid a food explosion. It could have benefited from a bit more veggies and tsatziki, as there were only a few lettuce leaves and a sparse amount of tomato and sauce.  The others in our party ordered a brushcette salad with chicken that was also dry with very bitter and overdressed romaine. There were also quite a few lettuce stems in the salad which is quite bizarre. A broiled steak kabob was also ordered. Again nothing extraordinary for the price. Rice was very salty, the green beans with tomato sauce were reminiscent of something you'd find in a geriatric cafeteria.  Service was also painfully slow and one waitress was arguing with what appeared to be her boyfriend. Despite that, our waiter was polite and took the salad off of our check.",

The windows are blacked out, and warm colors fill the room to add to the time distortion. There are about eight tables and two big booths for your hookah party. The best part is that they serve food from the restaurant side. A small bar is located toward the back, and one of their rinks was featured on $40 a Day with Rachael Ray. I can't remember the name, but it is tropical and sweet, and if you asked, I'm sure they would know which one you were talking about. It pairs nicely with a fruity hookah too. The Hookah Lounge is small and cozy and always a good time.  Recommended Hookah flavor: Mango Jasmine Mint  Recommended drink: A mojito. For sure.",

I had the saganaki appetizer and mozzarella sticks which were both excellent. I like the Italian/Mediterranean theme they have going on. I ordered the gyro platter for dinner and thought it was delicious. I wish I wasnt with family because I wouldve loved to go into the hookah lounge and smoke. I ordered a side of their anthens fries, and they were really bomb",

    "text": "Visited Paymon's for the first time this past weekend for my Dad's 50th birthday. I was a bit leery when we walked in, it was not very busy. The hostess seated us right away and a friendly waiter got us our drinks.  Started with a Magic Carpet, my stepmom got a vanilla type of martini. Martini was kind of gross, but mine was delish (redbull, vodka, and chambord. Simple enough.) We had the combination as an appetizer, comes with falaffel, tabouli, baba ganoush, hummus, and bouranni and stuffed grape leaves which I always avoid at all costs. My homemade tabouli is much tastier, but the rest was very very good. This was all new to my Dad and he was impressed. Dad got chicken fesenjan, which he swore was amazing, as a vegetarian I refused to taste it, so all I can say is my Dad is a total meat and potatoes guy, and he was about to lick that damn plate. Hubby had meatball sandwich, not really sure why they serve Italian here! I got the eggplant panini and was not impressed, a bit bland, just a plain mushy sandwich. But the FRIES... omg YUM they really are great!! We finished up with some tirimasu, heavy on the rum, just the way we like it, and some sort of dessert martini which they added dark chocolate to at my request. All of the food was good, not super amazing, and I should have avoided the Italian and enjoyed Meditteranean. I would go back, great atmosphere! We had my kids and sadly could not enjoy the hookah, but the lounge smelled divine when we passed by it!",

    "text": "So my lady and I came in for happy hour on a Monday evening with no expectations whatsoever.  We entered the lounge area where all the smoking takes place.  We're not smokers, but were pleasantly surprised with the subtle aroma of the few smokers in the vicinity.  I'd characterize it as a cross between pipe tobacco and light, fruity incense.  Anyways, we enjoyed a number of the half-off appetizers and cocktails.  The appetizers were great.  We had the stuffed grape leaves (filled with a well-seasoned ground beef), the pesto pita pizza with mushrooms, the falafel and the chicken fingers dipped in a phenomenal buffalo sauce.  Each one was better than expected.  The drinks were also very good and we walked out with the perfect buzz.  I'd recommend the Lychee martini for a strong, yet tasty after-work drink.    The atmosphere was very serene and unique for the Vegas scene.  It was hard to imagine that we were in the heart of Summerlin while sitting on a wraparound couch and surrounded with dimmed, colored lighting and interesting, yet well-themed artwork.    We were there for an hour and had a great time.  There is no doubt we will be back.",

This year the food seemed \"tired.\" I have heard people on \"Top Chef\" talking about putting \"heart\" into their cooking. This time Paymon's food had no heart, it seemed like it was phoned in. Also the service was so-so. Therefore my review is down from 5 stars. I don't mean you should stay away, especially when you most everything you can spend money on in Las Vegas is a rip off. I did not feel ripped off this year, just disappointed. See my review on the Himalayan restaurant on Flamingo for our new favorite/good buy restaurant.",

I also like the baba ganosh (eggplant blended w/tahini, garlic, olive oil, and lemon juice)  as far as entrees, i always order either the  pastitsio ( a casserole filled w/ground beef, pasta, tomato, and cheese) or moussaka (a casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, and ground beef).  i'm always too full to eat dessert, but i finish my dinner off with some dark rich sweetened turkish coffee.... .",

I had the Curry Chicken, she had the Chicken Kabob thingys with humus.  We split an order of the Athens Fries (I got the reference for the fries from other reviewers. They were pretty awesome) and got a bottle of wine.  The food was delicious, the wine was perfect for the food, and we had leftovers to take back to enjoy later. After dinner we went to the adjoining room and got a spot to smoke some hookah.  2 friends joined us to smoke and we all sat around talked and had some drinks also.  The dirty martini with Belvidere vodka was probably the best one Ive ever had from anywhere.  The atmosphere in there was awesome, the music never got annoying, and we had a great time.  The only thing I would change about this place is I would keep it open later than 1am.  I wish they had a place like this in Long Beach. Maybe Ill open one like it someday.",

Vegetables steamed to perfection.  My sister had the tilapia with artichokes with angel hair pasta and it was amazing too. Then they have these seasoned French fries that are the bomb!!    My new favorite. I've only gotten the take out and have not eaten in the restaurant, but I sure plan to!!!",

Once seated it took a long time for the waiter to arrive even though the place was pretty empty. Food took a long time once ordered. Food was just average. I can't say I would recommend or return.",

The Moscow Mule I drank was one of the best given the fact it was at a hookah lounge. Everything seemed great... until I got the hookah. They had a lot of interesting mixes on the menu but the one issue I had was that they put a cover on top of the bowl and only use 1 piece of charcoal. I asked the server and she said that it was Paymon's policy. As a regular hookah smoker, my standards are pretty high and the hookah just didn't meet my expectations. There wasn't enough smoke and I had to ask for them to fix it multiple times.   I would definitely go back if I'm with a big group as the place is fun due to the music and drinks. But if I want to smoke a good hookah I would go somewhere else.",

Both dishes were great, presentation was pretty, only thing stopping me from giving Paymons a 5 Star Rating was that the Pita Bread that comes with the dishes was chewy and rubbery.  Asked our waitress for some more Pita bread but it came out the same way.  Aside from that the food was great and tasted good.  Also I got an invite from Paymons that \"Mothers eat free\" with the purchase of entree.   WISH THEY WOULD BRING BACK LOCAL WEDNESDAY, WHERE THE LOCALS HAD THEIR FOOD DISCOUNTED BY 25%.  I am not a drinker so offering me a discounted drink or wine doesn't do it for me.  I think many locals miss that Wednesday FOOD discount.  Bring it back and definitely you will much busier than you have been since you did away with it when you opened the Henderson restaurant.  Just a thought.",

    "text": "Came here later in the night to introduce a friend of ours to hookah, since she's never experienced it before. We decided to go to Paymon's because it received good ratings & reviews.  We arrived here about 9pm on a Wednesday night & walked directly into the bar/hookah lounge area. It wasn't packed, but it was getting pretty filled up, so I guess we came at a pretty good time.   The lounge itself was definitely well, maintained. Hookahs are already set up on the tables, & the loaded bowls are brought out to you. If you're looking for more of a up tempo, club scene.. this is definitely not it. It's more a relaxed, social get together atmosphere. You mostly see \"older\" adults here enjoying some hookah & drinks, compared to other locations where it's blasting top 40 & people are getting crazy. So keep that in mind when you're looking for a hookah lounge.  My husband & I aren't necessarily \"experts,\" but we occasionally set up our own sessions at the comfort of our home. We have our preferences with flavors & were happy to hear that they had several, but not many, Fumari brand flavors. Their main brand is Al Fahker (sp?). We decided to mix Fumari White Gummi w/ Tangelo & it was a pretty good tasting mix. BUT, it would have been a better experience if the hookah was set up differently?  The bowl was a little small for the price, the air flow wasn't as smooth & a little difficult to inhale. The clouds weren't as thick.. so that was kind of disappointing. And when we asked to have the coals flipped, they literally take off the bowl, shake it a little, since it had a topper & there you go: \"coal flip.\" Lol  We ordered a few drinks, nothing so crazy that I would brag about them. A Lychee Martini, a Margarita on the rocks, and two Angry Orchards. The service was good, but I feel personally since we were probably the youngest ones in the lounge, our server didn't really take us seriously. No matter, though because the environment was more older crowd.   If you're wanting to enjoy a nice, chill place to smoke some shisha w/ friends & grab a drink or bite, this place isn't all too bad. If you're selective w/ your hookah experience, just be wary!",

Hookah is good, if you can ask Eddie to make it he is awesome!  Cons: Extremely stingy on coal!!!!! I mean seriously who does that, i am a very frequent hookah smoker and own several of my own, and we all know how long one charcoal lasts.

All in all, everyone I basically know has one and we always smoke it together whether just to chill or when we have a pahteeeee.   I started coming to Paymon's years ago. The hookahs were always real good and didn't taste burnt. The guys would come around to make sure the hookah was still hitting well and constantly replaced the coals. The happy hour all day Tuesday was the best with half off hookahs and lots of drinks to choose from.  Nowadays, I hardly ever go here, because the hookahs are always burnt and die really fast. The service is lacking now - I literally have to wave my hands in the air and do a little dance to get someone's attention. The drink refills dont come fast anymore so I'm always contemplating if I should just order two drinks instead of one.   I used to like the other location on Maryland Pkway better, but I always came here due to distance. The other location is just the same now - the hookahs arent's as great. I'd advise you to just smoke at home where you'd get the best service haha",

    "text": "I can't complain about the food. Everything was pretty good... the hummus, yogurt with cucumber dip, falafel, steak kabobs. The kabob was a huge serving that my wife and  split and couldn't finish. The quality of the meat was good and correctly cooked to the requested temp. It didn't come with Basmati rice, but did have rice pilaf with a wonderful butteriness to it.  Their menu is ridiculously large with cuisines including Italian, Mediterranean, Persian, Greek, and Indian. In my opinion they'd be better off with a more focused menu, but I guess they have to do what they can to attract the most customers. They even have a kid's menu with all the typical kid stuff.   Service was decent and prices were ok. The interior looks a little dated but it was comfortable enough.",

    "text": "Love the food here. The service is usually pretty spot on. They are flexible with customizing dishes. We've been here several times. My only complaint is they keep the door open between the restaurant and the hookah lounge. I don't feel like coming to eat and inhaling second hand smoke. I'm not sure what the purpose of leaving it open is. It's not fair to restaurant diners who don't want to smell that stuff and want to enjoy their food. I hope they will consider closing it going forward. *EDIT:  Someone from the establishment replied to my review and claim that it's not smoke, that is actually not True. It is smoke but it's filtered through water and smoke still comes out. As far as the airflow going the opposite direction, we've eaten there many times and we love the food but we can definitely smell the hookah in the dining room. It's horrible. There's NO reason that the door shouldn't be closed between the bar and the dining room. From a hookah fact sheet: \"Hookah smoking is not safer than cigarette smoking. Also known as a narghile, shisha or goza, a hookah is a water pipe with a smoke chamber, a bowl, a pipe and a hose. Specially made tobacco is heated, and the smoke passes through water and is then drawn through a rubber hose to a mouthpiece.\"",

A few rounds of drinks, some great Athens fries, some stuffed grape leaves and a plate of calamari later...What else can you ask for. Hmmm the mad hatter, that's what. The local hookah master took good care of us refilling our hashish right when we needed it. We went from mint to the mad hatter and I have to say, The Mad Hatter takes the cake.   Tonight was the happy hour in the hookah lounge and it makes it very very affordable, the decor was done well, the light is kept low and the music is turned up as the night goes on. The place has a slight clubbish vibe when it comes to the music and the atmosphere which was nice. The music was loud but not obnoxious, we could still carry on a conversation without screaming. From looking at the regular menu I can see that the food may be a little pricey when not on happy hour but this is now a Tuesday happy hour favorite for me.",

    "text": "After visiting various hookah bars since the ripe old age of 18 I can definitely say that Paymon's is by far the best I've been to.  The decor is awesome, Mediterranean themed with a very relaxed atmosphere. The comfy bench seating and throw pillows always make me feel at home. The only think I don't like is the tables and chairs made for little people. I am 5'10\" and the boyfriend is 6'5\" so when we go with a group of friends it is always a bit cramped. However, when it's just me and him we spread out comfortably.   The hookahs are always smooth and tasty, at $15 each it doesn't get any better. I have tried hookahs at bars and clubs in town and they were no where near Paymon's standards and are usually double the price!   The food is pretty good as well, I am not much into Mediterranean food except maybe hummus. The pesto hummus at Paymon's is delicious! You cannot go wrong with their \"Athens Fries\", the spices that they use to season the fries are out of this world! The drinks are so/so every specialty drink I have had has been overpowering or not the right flavor combinations so I stick to beer or pellegrino most of the time.  The service is hit or miss, sometimes it is excellent and other times we are waiting 45 min for a hookah or 30 min for drink refills. I guess it depends on who serves you.   Paymon's happy hour is one of the best in town with $7.50 hookahs and half off drinks and appetizers. Tuesdays are locals nights where happy hour goes from 5pm-1am, just make sure you get there early since the place fills up fast!",

All of the pita sandwiches come in a paper bag to help them from falling a part.  The bag just made it seem cheap and reminded me of a fast food restaurant. Plus the bag did not prevent my pita from falling apart, and I ended up having to eat it with a fork and knife.    There are no lunch specials, so expect to pay full dinner prices.  The pita sandwiches, which are close to $10, do not come with ANY sides and fries are extra.",

    "text": "Paymon's is on my regular rotation since it is near my work and one of the few Mediterranean places close by. (RIP Madpita Express *sniff sniff*) I would really give it 3.5 stars so I rounded up. The prices are high for what you get. The salads are a deal though, as you can easily share them. The Gyro salad is huge and pretty tasty. The gyro pita sandwich however doesn't fare as well. We always have to ask for more tahini sauce because of the minuscule amount they put on it. The sandwich is honestly mostly lettuce, very little meat. The pasta I've had there wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't anything I have reordered since. I tried the pesto sauce with angel hair pasta. The pesto lacked flavor and was too heavy for my liking. The food here isn't amazing by any means, but it's sufficient for a nice business lunch.",

Even though it was not at the height of the lunch hour I had to flag down my waitress to order, flag her down for my bill and had to ask another worker to help me to get a to-go box.  Not the most attentive/ available wait staff that day, but that may not be a reflection of the service overall.  Glad to have tried it but probably wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "Although this is my first review for Paymon's, I have dined and lunched in several times and it's always a 5 stars especially with the Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Curry. However, I am on a veggie cleanse and after eating all the veggie dishes last night with a friend....it is as good as it gets!   Paymon's is definitely a very good restaurant with a wide range of variety of dishes that a meat carnivore and veggie delight eater can both enjoy!   As veggie delight eaters, we ordered the following:  STUFFED GRAPE LEAVES Served cold as Paymon's Greek version of Dolmas consists of young, tender, grape leaves, stuffed with rice and flavorful herbs. Served with delicious Tzatziki sauce.  ATHENS FRIES As it says on the menu, these fries are highly addictive and indeed they are! Addiction derives from their house seasoned fries accompanied by a delicious creamy dipping. Nevertheless, I like to dip mine with their special bottled hot sauce.  HUMMUS One of my favorite delectable dip! Puree of chickpeas, Tahini, fresh garlic, olive oil and fresh lemon juice.   BABA GANOSH The name speaks for it self, it sounds like a hot Greek man riding on a white horse down the white sands of Greece....but it is a scrumptious mixture of seasoned, baked eggplant, blended with Tahini, fresh garlic, Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  TABULI SALAD What a fresh Mediterranean classic of a salad! Tabuli salad is combined with chopped parsley, bulgur wheat, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and fresh mint leaves. Tossed with their house seasonings, extra virgin Olive oil and fresh lemon juice.  I know I know...it has gluten in it, but it's already hard to be gluten free so I ate it anyway! This salad is delicious!!  EGGPLANT PARMESAN This Fresh Eggplant coated with Italian bread crumbs, layered with roasted whole garlic, Marinara sauce and topped with Mozzarella cheese was sooooo gooood!!!  It even came with Barilla penne pasta Marinara which made the dish so huge and plenty of left overs.  I heart Paymon's!!",

    "text": "My friend K and I flew into Vegas for the Rock n Roll Las Vegas events. Seeking a healthy and yummy lunch, K suggested Paymon's. She'd discovered this place when she had a project in LV and I was happy to go along as I love Mediterranean cuisine.  A little ways off the strip, this gem can be found in an unassuming strip mall. The restaurant itself is quite large and it looks like from the doors that they have expanded into adjacent storefronts a few times. I can see why :)  When we arrived for a late lunch, we were quickly seated by a friendly hostess. Our waiter was great--checked in with us regularly and helped us figure out how much to order without over ordering.   We decided to split a plate because he advised us it was large--it was! The chicken kabob skewer has 10 ounces of meat on it! We also split a side of dips--the babaghanouj and the yogurt dip. The baba was probably the best I've ever had! It comes with a side of white or whole wheat pita. When we ran out, we were offered more pita or sliced veggies (super healthy--love it!)  The chicken kabob plate was perfect for two fit friends to split. With 10 ounces of grilled chicken, we each got ample protein. It also came with a greek salad, roasted red peppers and a great rice dish. We finished most, but not all of the plate--that's how large it was.  Since we were visiting and didn't have a car, we asked our waiter to call a cab and he quickly obliged. When one didn't show up, he checked in, found out the cab company was in the middle of a shift change, and took the initiative to call a second cab company so that we wouldn't have a much more prolonged wait.   If I lived locally, this would definitely be a place I'd come regularly. Tasty food, good portions and great service--winner in my book!",

The ambiance and decor of this place was remarkable. High ceilings, beautiful carpeting on the floors and walls. I for sure felt like I walked into the castle where Aladdin dreamed of living.  The hookah side was not too smoky and you could eat your food, enjoy your drink, and sit comfortably without being bothered by the other parties. I of course tried the hookah, we had watermelon margarita and it was good considering I don't smoke. But the real treasure of this place. The food and drinks. Oh man. Ok so first I ordered their version of a cosmo with a sugared rim. Not bad, especially if you get it during happy hour. We had hummus, pesto pizza with red peppers, chicken masala, lamb kabobs, and salmon.  I would order every single thing again. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the spices were not overwhelming. Same thing with the salmon. I loved that they had Greek and Italian options as well as curry, and other more authentic style Indian Cuisine. Then at the end, I tried the Bloody Mary. NO REGRETS even after being stuffed. The mix was house-made and it was spiced perfectly. My mouth literally waters for one as I type.  I cant wait to go back, I probably wont hookah, but I will enjoy plenty of decently priced food and drinks. I hear they get crazy on the weekends, DJ and all.",

Just for a new coal.. price doesn't matter but when no one is attentive or at least informative of their rules its a big NO for me .. aside from that food was delicious  .

They'll bring you one monstrous plate of pasta first, I was surprised I went for a 2nd and 3rd serving (smaller plates).  Their servings aren't small but they are pretty reasonably priced, cheap if you can go during Happy Hour. They have a pretty awesome Happy Hour of 50% off almost everything from cocktails, bears, food and hookahs which run from 5pm-7pm everyday.  Tuesdays there have a different Happy Hour but run longer 5pm-1am (Best night).  They have a large hookah area separate from their large dinning area, always good.  Great service. A fan of their decor and atmosphere. Hey why is there a tree in the middle of the dinning area I hope a bird doesn't poop in my food haha, fake trees gotta love them.

The food is still delicious as I remembered it. Their Athens Fries are still the best ever!!! I always order the Mousakka which has eggplant in it and I normally don't eat that on a regular BUT I will when I come here. The only disappointment is that this time around the eggplant was cooked and slice differently where it was difficult to cut or bite through without the whole slice falling out. I hope they go back to the way they used to cook it but other than that the flavor and everything else was still amazing. My friend ordered the Pesto Hummus and that was also very tasty. They also have hookah here and I don't know too much about it but they seem busy with that. Come check this place out.",

The waitress was SUPER helpful.  She suggested the perfect blend and it was AMAZING! We ordered their famous fries and it was the right compliment.  The bar mix was also great.  The lounge area was super relax.  The music was top hits but it was still chill.  There were a couple of people and  the place was super open.  I totally  enjoyed our experience and we can't wait to come back to this place.  I highly recommend it.  The area was a bit run down but I didn't come here to eat in the parking lot.  I wanted some legit Hookah!  Really close to the strip.  Super close to 515.  I would recommend this place hands down.  Location SUPER DARK BUT CLEAN Hookah section WAS CLEAN AND OPEN Parking lot has A LOT OF SPOTS Food IS AMAZING  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!",

They have a hybridized Mediterranean menu fusion type thing going on. This place is excellent for intimate settings solo Excursions or huge parties. The staff was very nice and professional.

The server comes and I ask if the dinning room is open & if we can seat ourselves or wait to be seated... she turns around and says... well we are serving you so you you need to wait over there if your not over 21... with a bitchy attitude..... needless to say we walked right out! This place use to be incredible however now it just looks dead- no one was dancing and none of the guest seemed like they were having a good time on Saturday night at 11pm!

    "text": "Hard to find a bad meal here. My friend and I popped in for a quick meal before a movie on a Friday night. This was my second time eating here and I had come before for lunch. This time dinner. We went early so not too busy, but this spot does fill up and the hookah lounge next door is popular.  We were sat at a nice quiet booth. We were promptly served a nice glass of wine. I opted for the chicken kebab platter served with a side salad,  basmati rice, hummus and a little pita bread. My friend had the gyro wrap with lamb. Their food is consistent here and always so fresh tasting. The wine perfectly complemented our dinner so we ended up having another glass. Our service was spot on and the vibe in the restaurant is very laid back. I am not so sure the music went with the food but oh well. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. I was too full to have dessert but definitely will be back to try.  The location is easy to find and when you pull in the plaza, the restaurant is right there in front of you.",

I'm mainly focusing on the lounge area which is separated from the main area. There are plenty of seating tables for a group of friends to chill on couches, get some great drinks, and listen to cool music (mix of hip hop, to club, to even some dubstep when I was there). There is a heated patio area also very nice to get away from the music to have more intimate convo's. Inside has a real bohemian type of feel with cool drapery as well as hookah available.  It's a great place to chill with friends, maybe even a date when you want to avoid the strip. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I have not tried out the entire restaurant yet soooo I need to go back soon and so should you!",

She was friendly and alerted us to a nice booth that was just opening up, instead of just sticking us at any table.  Our waiter was very familiar with all the dishes and recommended his favorites, as well as commented on the wines we were considering.  Noticed that they have a 1/2 portion menu for a limited time that includes some of their huge portion items (like the Spanakopita).  This evening we opted for the small Indian section of the menu (I know, Indian at a Mediterranean restaurant??)  The Chicken Tandoori was very tender and the Mango Chutney dipping sauce superb.  The portion was perfect also. The Chicken Curry dish was excellent, although I would have preferred more chicken. That was my only knock on the meal, although for the price I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker.  The atmosphere is quite nice. And for the hookah smokers out there, the lounge is a great stop.  All in all, Paymon's is a great off-strip stop and I will be back.",

There are no words for how amazing this was. We also had the warm dolmas, the Pastitsio (another must try), and the gyros platter. I left there pretty full and happy. Delicious!!!",

    "text": "I first discovered Paymon's before I moved to Vegas.  I had read an article that said they unequivocally had the best fries in Las Vegas.  I rushed out and picked up an order of fries to go and wasn't disappointed.  When I moved to Vegas, Paymon's was the first restaurant I ate at.  It was absolutely delicious and has a wide variety of menu offerings.  I love the freshly wrapped grape leaves.  The chilled leaves have just the right amount of citrus and are firm.    The lentil soup is savory and well balanced.  The soup itself can be very filling as a light meal.  The Athens fries.  Where do I start?  These fries are always served hot and thick.  They aren't too starchy and are coated with Paymon's proprietary spice blend.  They are served with a delicious sauce.  The spanikopita portion is huge.  The phyllo is flaky and the filling is rich and creamy.  The salmon tandoori comes complete with a huge mound of rice.  The salmon is plump and tender, cut into large cubes.  The tangy seasoning is great and well balanced.  Personally, I opt for the combination platter.  It is a little taste of everything, from falafel, fries, babaganoush, tabouli, bourrani an hummus.  It is served with fresh pita.  Oh, and one of my friends would kill me if I didn't mention the Chicken Fesenjen.  He says it is killer.",

    "text": "Given the close proximity of Paymon's to me, I'm a bit embarrassed that I'd never been. The hostess was unfriendly but, lucky for her, I was distracted by the restaurant's decor. Big. fan. For my 1st time, I was pleased to be there during the sweet-spot of the evening where I got to see what it was like with all the natural light from the skylights then the dim lighting once the sun set. The chairs were a pleasant surprise- they have a little give when you lean back in them. Uber comfy. Unlike the hostess, our waitress was very friendly. We ordered their fries & mozzarella sticks for appetizers- not a single complaint! Later, with our entrees, we had some sides of tzatziki that I enjoyed dipping the fries in more than the standard sauce. I ordered the beef kabobs, at the recommendation of our waitress- it came with a small side salad & basmati rice. All very tasty! My g.f. got the gyro salad with a side of tzatziki, in addition to the dressing- I had a nibble of the salad & would definitely order it. Because I fell in love with the baklava, on a previous Yelpventure at Petra, I HAD to try Paymons'! Obviously, now I think I'm an expert &, in my expert opinion, the baklava at Paymon's is good but Petra's could take it out to the monkey bars & beat it up. Even so, I'll absolutely return to Paymon's & I'll probably even save room for dessert.",

(Even a small Greek salad can be shared.) My favorite thing to eat there is the lentil soup. My biggest complaint is that the food is overpriced.

The atmosphere is cute with a Mediterranean touch and every Wed they offer 25% off your entire bill so it's a great value! Favorites off the menu are - saganaki! Flaming cheese that comes with warm pita bread and you drizzle lemon all over it! I also love the variety plate that comes with lamb, chicken & a mixed meat skewer that is perfect for sharing! The rice and vegetables are so delicious and you always get a huge tomato that just came off the grill! I'm a huge fan of these Mediterranean flavors!  They have great ice tea with mint & a slice of orange, it's a must if you're an ice tea drinker! There's also a hookah lounge if you're into that and when the door opens from the restaurant I always hear fun European house music!",

You can choose a spice level for the curry as well.   I like the chicken better from the tandoori and love dipping it in the curry sauce.  However, they charge something like $5 for sauce on the side so I find it a better deal just to order an entire curry chicken meal.  The saffron rice is the best.  In the past I've had also had their HH athens fries, chicken wings and hummus.  Not the best for your waist line but definitely satisfying for the belly.",

It's always nice to smoke hookah and eat nice foods, drinks, and chill. They have a great friend calamari, wings, baba ganosh, kabob, and salads :) Their cocktail is amazing, hookah is okay!

I've only had greek food once before this and I like it.  But wanted to try more variety.  So I ordered the appy - combination platter.  You get a little of everything.  Loved it all.  Falafel was my fav.  Cucumber yogurt dip - so good.  Baba ganosh, again, so good.  Friend had a chicken pesto panini - loved it.  Friend had a gyro salad - nice portion size - you'll bring some home - she loved it.  Hummus on the table was delicious.  All the dishes were great.  The service was AWESOME.  We had a party of 10 and needed separate checks, (you have to call in advance to let the manager know so she can staff accordingly!)  and she kicked a$$.  Our waitress was awesome.  I would definitely come back for lunch or even another party.  Great service.  Keep up the good work!",

I've been in places where the service staff would start moving and grooving to get the patrons to hit the dance floor but not here. I know DJ's thrive on people responding to the music they play and dance all night and sweat their face off. But that was not the case. The staff was more worried about someone's foot on a seat versus people dancing and ordering more drinks and food to continue their night. I'm sure I will be back to try the happy hour and spend my late nights elsewhere",

Both are extremely tasty and the fries are some of the best in town. No lie. But tonight I went with the kabob plate which was two skewers is kabob with rice and a grilled tomato. Quality was on point and just as good as the pita sandwich I usually get. I also ordered a side of hummus and I was very impressed. Usually restaurant hummus is bland but this was very good consistency and tasted super authentic. To drink I had their iced tea, which for some reason is really tasty too even though it's not sweetened.   Service was a little slow for dinner because I think they usually are much more busier during the day. But the food was great and I will definitely come back.   Oh don't forget to order dessert. Rice pudding is perfect!",

My steak kabobs with veggies lacked flavor. Overall was not very good. I also felt like we were listening to horrible mixed music. It turned out that the music from the kitchen was so loud it was blending with the restaurant ambience. Anyway by the end of my meal I had a headache. The waiter was a very nice guy and apologized but the place needs to be operated better. Sorry to say this maybe my last trip to eat here.",

    "text": "I'm a little surprised by the low rating of Paymons! A friend and I went for lunch one day, which was so good I had to take my BF there for dinner and hookah later that same week!  For lunch, I got a chicken gyro which was perfectly seasoned. It didn't come with any sides, which was fine because I couldn't even finish it alone!! The flavor was really good and that tahini sauce was amazing. I also got a Moroccan tea, which was so needed for the cold and wet day we were there. I think my meal was around $15 for meal, tea & tip. Not bad!!  I took a different friend and my boyfriend for dinner and hookah later the same week. I got a chicken kabob entree, which again was waaaay too much food. My boyfriend got the chicken curry and said it was wonderful. My friend got falafel and she was really happy with it. We went on a Saturday night which is apparently a really popular time for their hookah lounge. We managed to find a table after we ate, so we puffed on hookah for a while and enjoyed some wine. It was a fun evening.   The decor is interesting - classic paintings line the walls, with chandeliers for lighting and lots of colors painted on the walls.   Both visits, our server was friendly and helpful. I think my only suggestion is to be seated as far back as possible because we kept getting a gust of cold air anytime the door opened. Brrrrrrrr!!!!   The food is good plus you get huge portions. The prices aren't too high & I found them very reasonable for the quantity of food.   I'll definitely be back!!",

    "text": "They updated main dining room look as well as opened up between hookah lounge and dining (used to be a wall, now it's windows). The change was intentional according to servers, so during DJ hours it felt more open. But I miss the secluded, hidden feel of the lounge so now I'm not as impressed.   They also got rid of Babylon Spice, by far their best specialty drink IMO. The other drinks are similar to what everyone else has. Hookah price average on non-hapoy hour...So it's still a cool space, but it's less loungy and feels less like a hidden den.  Happy hour still good pricing, but be sure to find out what time it starts/ends. Locals happy hour may be a better time to visit.",

On one hand you can enjoy a nice meal off the big menu for lunch or dinner and on the other hand you can go to the hookah lounge in the evening and enjoy a more laid back environment accompanied with snacks. There are two different locations, and I love them both. I love the decor of the hookah lounge as I feel like I've stepped into another country.   Great spot for a lunch date as there's no wait and it's quiet, dinner with family to enjoy food, or fight night with friends to get your hookah and drink on!   P.s. Do yourself a favor and try the pesto hummus.",

My favorite thing to get is a Greek salad and add on the salmon.  They make a light, but flavorful house dressing, just the right amount of cheese, and plenty of veggies.  It's definitely enough to fill you for a whole meal, or to share with a friend while you also order a round of their great appetizers (like hummus, grape leaves, etc).    It's also a good starter place if you are new to Mediterranean and Greek fare as the staff is generally knowledgeable, and the menus are pretty comprehensive.   It's a great place to eat for a casual date or lunch meeting.",

A few weeks back my family and I stopped in for dinner just past 9 pm.  Our drink orders were taken (tap water for me, an ice tea, and a child's soda) and menus were presented.  When the waitress brought back the drinks I asked if we could have a full house menu, as there was only bar food.  She said that the kitchen had just closed and this was all they had.  I don't a lot of fried food, and neither does my child.  He wanted hummus and pita, so I asked if she could go into the kitchen and see if there was any hummus or baba ganoush left, figuring I could always have it on a pita as a vegetarian sandwich.  It was literally 10 after 9, and the items I was asking for were no cook.  Plus, other diners were still being served from the kitchen.  She came back and said that the chef wouldn't be able to accommodate me, and that she didn't know why.  She apologized and said that she works every Thursday night and I could come back any other time after hours and get it.  Well...If I could have it on any other Thursday night after 9 pm, why couldn't I have it on that night?  Especially when other diners were still being served food from the full menu?    We decided not to stay, and apologized to her.  She gave us a bill for the ice tea and soft drink which came to over $6!  We paid and left.    I have always loved their food, but no matter how much I want it, I doubt I will go back.",

Although decor is very nice and seemingly authentic, there is a touch of fakeness and not authenticity about it all; The waitresses are always recomending the more \"Americanized\" dishes and knew very little of the more traditional Mediterranean dishes the few times that I dined here.   2. They started offering pasta! dishes!!! What travesty offering run of the mill spaghetti in a Hookah lounge and Mideterranean place, let's focus on the cuisine at hand!!!  3. Kataifi, my favorite desert is gone!!!  I still enjoyed my Fatoush salad and Baklava desert, and teas were certainly good, but food is still far from what it is at the Maryland location. It seems like the owners are trying to capitalize by abandoning more traditional fair and offering more \"poplar with the masses\" fair. I was not impressed and won't come to this location of Paymon's again, unless I am really pressed to find no other dining establishment (not likely).",

The chicken is always juicy and well seasoned. As for the rice, ditch the jasmine and ask them to substitute Turkish rice because it goes so much better with it.  Tea suggestion: Morroccan blend!",

The interior of Paymon's is well decorated and cozy, but it's not at all a snooty atmosphere and casual wear is perfectly fine (that said, I will say that I felt underdressed whilst wearing my hiking clothes and desperately needing a shower post-hike).  The prices are a little on the higher side, although apparently there is an all-you-can-eat pasta special for only $9 (it seems like a good deal to me, but I'm not a big pasta fan so I didn't order it).  A simple vegetarian pita sandwich with no sides runs on the order of ~$8-9. I had the Eggplant pita, and it was overall very good.  The ingredients (grilled eggplant and roasted red peppers) tasted very fresh and the pesto sauce had good flavor.  It wasn't the most overwhelming sandwich I've ever had, but I would be inclined to order it again.  The thing that stood out the most in my experience was the flaming saganaki (greek cheese).  That was FANTASTIC!  I am a fairly picky cheese eater, and was extremely happy when I tried this.  The texture was excellent with a crispy outside and gooey inside, and the cheese itself had a very elegant flavor.   I will definitely be going back to Paymon's in the future, and am excited to try some of their other dishes!",

I can't imagine its too authentic. The seasoned fries are great, though.   The apps are a nice accompaniment to the smokes. A bowl is ~$15 and a refill is like ~$8 I think. They have a variety of flavors. I remember when the whole no smoking where food is served thing was around. Paymon's complied for a sec, but then reverted back.   Sometimes we get picky about how hot the coal is or how the shisha is burning, but the smoke boy comes around and makes it all better.   The drinks are okay-priced. If you ask for a water, they'll give you a tiny Fiji for like $5. I think the food prices are reasonable, though. Get the app combo platter (classy, huh?) for $11 to feed a non-ravenous group of three. Baklava and rice pudding are vera nice.   On the weekends, the lounge fills up. I've seen the restaurant side get busy, but not packed. The lounge is open late, but not late enough. 1a every night.   The lounge is lowkey and chill. Its perfect for the nights you want to get out of the house, but not deal with the crowds or yelling over loud music. Sometimes they play Middle Eastern jams. Sometimes its like club electronica.   * off the strip, non-casino",

Food is dead on and very healthy... something that I care about. Only criticism I have is for Vegas, this place closes too early at 1am! Check this place out next time u are in Vegas.",

But make sure you have gum after; the fries leave you with an unpleasant breath afterwards. Service is usually always great. We have a 20 month old, and I love their highchairs. It's the plastic ones that are almost like a high chair you would have at home. The only negative comment I have is that my gyro always falls apart!",

The hummus was delicious and the spinach pie *(spanakopita) was very good but the side of stewed vegetables were awful and the rice seemed ill matched in our opinion.  We had horrible service sitting outside because we were the only table and would strongly suggest sitting inside where there is really good atmosphere.  The menu had a Greek section, Indian Section and Italian.  We only had Greek food but our server said the Curry is excellent. I would return but only for lunch or takeout and would try the kabobs like my friend recommended and the hummus appetizer. I'm sure they have some other great options but I have a feeling the menu is hit or miss, it's hard to do everything well. This would be a good inexpensive place for a large group and it's super casual.",

    "text": "I used to go to the Paymons by UNLV fairly frequently when i lived on that side of town. My boyfriend and i were in the market for a new happy hour to check out, so i found this place on my mobile app. Regretting it greatly now. First regret, the specialty cocktails. Margaritas were ridiculously too sweet, and i read through the ingredients. They use a mix i have used before, so i'm not sure how those got screwed up... and I'm a bartender.  Next, we ordered the hummus as a starter, and it arrived surprisingly fast. Downside however was it was depressingly bland and oozy, not thick or flavorful at all. We figured oh well, the entrees should make up for it. I ordered the gyro pita, accompanied by athens fries, my boyfriend got the pesto pizza. I couldn't pick up the thing, cuz it would probably fall apart, so i proceeded to make little mini pitas by tearing pieces of it and putting the meat, tomato, onion and tzatziki sauce inside, very messy. I now realize that we were never given settings or napkins. Since my boyfriend had to go looking for our server a couple times, i said to hell with it and got some paper hand towels from the bathroom. My server saw me come back with said towels, and said nothing to us or checked in still. Back to the food. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was way off with the gyro meat, a little too 'chewy' i suppose, and barely warm.. the fries weren't really anything to write home about. My boyfriend said his pizza was basic and bland also. The only time server finally checks on us, he rudely interrupted my boyfriend and i having a moment. We asked for a box and the check. In all honestly the only reason for the box was to give the food to the dogs. The check arrived, and we were thrown for a loop. I have no problem paying for a quality fare, but we were under the impression that most of our items were on happy hour pricing. Nope. 2 drinks, hummus, pizza and my gyro came out to 50 bucks, wtf. I then got on here and learned that happy hour pricing was only on Tuesday nights. Another thing i came across in these reviews was that Weds nights are customer appreciation night and they take 25% off the final check.  Again, didn't happen. We were over it at this point and just wanted to vacate. Again, my boyfriend had to go looking for our server,  who he said gave him an irritated look when we needed change. I always leave 20% as i am in the industry, and can understand that not all issues are the service staffs fault. In this case I'll admit I lowballed. To make it even better, as we were getting some stuff at the gas station on the way home, i rapidly became unbearably nauseas and ran outside to throw up. Definitely won't be caught here again, i don't even think i feel safe giving the hounds the food anymore... that's bad.",

The decor was nice, I liked the outside patio.   After reading the reviews we ordered a side of Athens fries and hummus.  The fries are amazing especially with the dipping sauce. The hummus was fine however the pita bread was not so good.  The bread tasted as if it was reheated prepackaged bread not freshly made.     For the main dishes we ordered the steak kabobs- medium and the gyros platter. Both were very tasty the steak was good quality meat and of big portion size.   They both came with rice and vegetables however I found the white rice to be bland tasting.  Overall the service was fast and our waiter always made sure we were taken care of.   It would of been 5 stars if it was not for the pita bread!",

When we vacation in Vegas once a year or so, Paymon's is always a must do.   The fried calamari appetizer is well done. Nothing to rave about, but it's good. The real draw, for us, is:  The \"gyros in pita\" is awesome. Lots of meat, plenty of veg, and a wonderful tzatziki sauce. Always pair it with Athens fries.   Overall, the food here is fresh and clean, with nice Med flavors. There's something here for everyone, including vegetarians and carnivores.

A plus for me for this place, is you get 50% military discount when showing your ID card. A meal for 2 of us with countless soft drinks came to under $20. Cant remember which night it is also, but one of the nights, there is a all you can eat pasta dish evening-different types of pastas and sauce. Will have to try that sometime.

We had a pre-New Years Eve party here in 2007 and all of our friends loved the place as well. The last time we were here was in the summer of 2009.  The curry is to die for and they will make the food super spicy if you ask. The outdoor area is great in the summer and inside the restaurant area is nice, though can be a little tight, so not a place you want to talk about anything too personal, though a great place to eat. The Hookah area is great, and while my wife isn't a smoker, she loved their jasmine and vanilla flavored tobacco.  Downside, you can't smoke a regular cigarette inside, though who would need too since you have a flavored hookah in front of you?",

    "text": "Paymon's (on Sahara) has gone from being a \"treat\" to more of a stand-by neighborhood restaurant, as my wife and 2 kids (10 & 7) enjoy ethnic and different places to eat.  And, what used to look like a pretty daunting restaurant (I mean, with the Hookah Lounge tag on the name and the rather imposing storefront), has become like a coffee shop or diner for us...and that's mostly a good thing.  I like the huge menu, and the ability to pick from Italian, Persian, Greek, and Indian (albeit only 3 choices) selections.  On Wednesdays, it's 25% off your entire tab, a great value!  Not being subscribers of local papers and always tossing out the ad-paks that come in the mail, I haven't seen all the 'coupons' mentioned by others.  So what about the food?  Decent job of the Chicken Curry - and the spice-to-taste option is great.  My 10-yr old enjoys it mild; I love it spiced to the max!  She wishes they put potatoes in the curry, but with the wonderful rice-bed that the curry sits on, I think she can live without the potatoes.  Maybe some veggies (besides the cursory onions) would make it a little more interesting, but hey, this isn't the Red Velvet Vegan Cafe (just down the street a bit).  Paymon's Greek platters are also good - Gyros platter, Baked Kibbe platter, etc.  I wish the Kibbe wasn't quite as \"moist\", and retained more of the beef texture, but it's still quite good.  I think the Athens Fries is a bit overrated - a little too salty for my taste.  I also enjoy the Fesenjan (Chicken breast cuts in a slightly tart/sweet yummy pomengranate sauce), but it wasn't to my wife's liking.  Your experience will very much vary depending on how you take to the specific spices used in each dish, so ask the server to elaborate.  The service is good, almost family-like, unless they are packed.  Then, a certain level of panic seems to set in, and it becomes hard to flag down your server.  Funny - I still like restaurants where the person who took your order is the same person who brings your food.  Sometime about 10 years ago, I think most \"big box restaurants\" adopted a serving method where someone more junior and less experienced than the person who took your order always brings out the food...and you lose the chance to question the food at the moment it arrives.  That is definitely a pet peeve of mine...especially when your original server who heard your specific requests doesn't come around until at least 5-10 minutes after another person has dropped the plates of food in front of you!  Annoying!  BUT...this doesn't happen at Paymon's!  Portions are large enough that I don't recall having room for dessert yet at Paymon's.  All in all, Paymon's is a handy restaurant to have close by.  They stay open to 11 pm every night, so no rushing down by 8 pm to try and make it.  Since our family has no interest in the Hookah Lounge, we don't even see the area to the left of the entrance.  The atmosphere inside is a slightly cheesy cross between Istanbul and the Taj Mahal, but it's not overbearing, and kind of grows on you.  Those who tend to always be cold should bring a sweater...unless you're going to be eating the extra-spiced version of the Chicken Curry!",

    "text": "I've always been a huge fan of supporting local businesses. Paymon's being one of them, but after last night I'll think twice about coming here.   First and foremost I may say Paymon's has an excellent happy hour. The service is usually terrible in the lounge area but we deal with it because it's a pretty awesome atmosphere. Being huge fans of Hookah and living in Summerlin, this location is usually our go to spot when we don't want to drive all the way down to The Olive Hookah Lounge. Food wise, the hummus and the stuffed grape leaves are awesome! The fries are so good that I have to talk myself out of getting them most of the time haha. Hookah wise we love the peach flavor.  Now for last night...  We came in with a few friends and I was wearing a Chargers baseball cap. The waitress (after taking our drink orders) told me I was not allowed to wear a hat. Now the very last time we came in I was wearing  the exact same hat. Very confused I asked her what the issue was. She said there were no hats allowed in the restaurant / lounge. Now I find this pretty insane. We are long time paying customers of Paymon's and I was being asked to leave over wearing a sports team baseball cap? I'm still pretty taken back by this, even now. We all ended up leaving and I probably won't return. It's such a shame.",

The gyro meat however was bland, lukewarm and soft rather than crisp on the edges. They give you a ton of meat though, but no pita. All in all I'd give the food 3.5 stars.   However the service was horrible. Our waiter didn't acknowledge us after taking our order even though he looked right at our table whenever he passed. We weren't offered refills until we we were completely finished with the meal. And no one wanted to give us our check. The service drops this place down to 2 stars.",

We were greeted warmly as we entered and were sat within 4 minutes. We already knew what we wanted to try so when our server came to get our drinks we also ordered our meal. We tried the Kabob Trio which was basically white basmati rice, brown basmati rice, chicken kabobs (their chicken was flavorful and really juicy!) , beef kabobs (they were SOOOOO GOOOD! Like melted in my mouth good!), and lamb kabobs (THE BEST lamb I've ever had. Not gamy, filled with flavor, cooked perfectly medium ), yogurt mix which complimented the lamb kabobs the best in my opinion, Greek salad, along with roasted onions and tomato.   The food was so delicious and the service was good enough that I would definitely come back. I would give a 5 star, but the service wasn't as amazing as the food. I'd recommend this to friends and families. The interior was pretty, had a nice relaxing ambience. And the hookah lounge at the other room looked pretty as well! It's a must try for next time.  The icing on the cake for this place was that we got our food at a discounted rate and we didn't even know it was happening. The Kabob Trio is usually 20 dollars plus tax, but I guess they have a sale going on on Wednesdays. So instead of paying 20, we paid 16 dollars for the massive Kabob Trio :)   Love this place, would try and recommend.",

My first visit was a year ago or so, and I was in the area tonight, and decided to give it another try. Well, strike 2....and I will just call it strike 3 based on principle.   1. Not greeted properly  2. Unnecessary wait 3. Sat myself & my party 4. Got my own menus & place settings 5. Ask for a manager who was just shy of \"worthless\" in her response and apology.  6. Asked for a server who could take care of us.  7. Server did a fairly good job.  8. Food was \"marginal\" compared to the Maryland Pkwy location  ** Will never return to the Paymon's on Sahara.",

    "text": "This review is going to be on the hookah lounge and not on the food. No, not this time. I believe I will have to make another visit to Paymon's just so I can retry their food and write up a review. It's been too many months since I've burned the roof of my mouth while trying to eat Saganaki and Athens Fries.  HOOKAH LOUNGE & SERVICE My cousin and her friend invited me here for a round of hookah the other night. We weren't sure if we were supposed to enter the lounge or wait at the front of the restaurant to be directed, but we had to wait quite a bit for someone to show up and help us -- by the way, there was hardly anyone dining in the restaurant at 8:00PM. When the hostess finally appeared, she directed us to the lounge where we waited AGAIN. Finally, we were told we could sit at a corner booth and that our hookah waitress (?) would arrive shortly.  We were given a tray containing an array of tobacco flavors to choose from, as well as a menu. The choices on the menu are pricier because some are specialty tobaccos infused with alcohol. For $15 you can mix different flavored tobaccos from the given tray and puff on hookah for more than an hour.  My cousin and I chose to mix margarita, peach, and strawberry which is an awesome, fruity blend.   You can also eat and drink in the hookah lounge. My cousin's friend ordered a couple bottles of Fat Tire beers for himself, while my cousin and I ordered a flavorful Moroccan tea. The plastic containers of honey that our waitress gave us were unnecessary because the tea was already naturally sweetened.   Our waitresses were nice, but they didn't stop by our table as much to see how we were doing, so we often had to play the waiting game.  OVERALL Really, I'd rate this a 3.5 than a 4.0, because the service could be better. I'm not sure if $15 is a reasonable price for a round of hookah, but I can say the experience was fun and a unique way to hang out with friends and unwind from a stressful day.",

A dolma is a grape leaf filled with seasoned beef and rice baked in tomato sauce. This is the closest one I can find to the ones I ate during my childhood.   I had the Fesenjan for my entree ($12.95). It's a boneless chicken breast that is slow cooked with crushed walnuts and pomegranate sauce. It's served with basamati rice. I typically don't like eating a lot of chicken because I'm afraid it would be bland but this was bursting with flavor! It has a tangy sweet flavor to it.   I also sampled their combination platter ($13.95) which comes with Hummus, Tabuli, stuffed grape leaves, falfel, yogurt cucumber dip, baba ganosh and Athens fries.

Been coming to Paymons for at least five years but this is bad.  He has become complacent.  In response to Jeff, I never called Paymon cheap, but the QUALITY of the coals. They are terrible. Even the employees complain. The couple times we have visited, it resulted in coals burning out within five minutes or less. THAT, is the problem I have along with the SERVICE, that can be slow.

Last night at locals' night, my husband was asked to leave because he had on a tank top. Today I looked on the website and there is no dress code listed for locals' night and the Facebook page only says casual attire. Paymons really isn't nice enough to have a dress code other than the standard \"no shoes, no shirt, no service.\" I hate to say this but I wonder if the issue was his tank top or that he is a black man with tattoos and had a tank top on. Either way I will no longer waste money here. I would much rather go to The Olive on Sunset which has a much better atmosphere and better service!",

    "text": "Paymon's has always been a local favorite, but I can only provide a very mediocre review.   We came in about 6 on Friday evening. The place was not busy, and the hostess greeted us right away. Fine. But she takes us to a table literally steps from the front door, directly in line with the kitchen door. Can you say freeway? Could have asked for another table, but I didn't...so my bad, but I don't think I should have had to...  Server came and took orders promptly, ok so far. Hummus appetizer comes out quickly, always delicious. Then the entrees came out, gyros salad for me, falamus pita for my wife. also delicious. Maybe not exactly authentic Mediterranean food, but yummy nonetheless. Shared a few Athens fries...these are the bomb.  So what's the problem? Indifferent service.  Our server did not once stop and ask how we were doing. After he took our order, he literally disappeared. A different server brought the food out, and of course our server didn't bother to check if we got everything we needed. He must have passed our table 10 times without so much as a nod of the head. I even had to flag him down for a water refill!   We finished eating and just sat there. No offer of dessert, nothing.  I flagged him down for the check, since by that time I was getting annoyed and just wanted to split.   We like Paymon's and will probably go back, but if the service is as poor  next time, we'll move on.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch during a trip to Vegas a few weeks back and unfortunately it was nothing from what I had hoped it would be. I was initially going to give this place no more than 2 stars, however the one thing I loved about this place is the decor. It's unlike any I've seen in the US, and I have been to plenty of Persian and middle eastern restaurants as well as hookah cafes. The ambiance and decor in the hookah lounge is absolutely stunning, however the hookah and the food are not.   We ordered the koobideh jabab and gyro sandwich and both came out dry and way too spicy. The spices used in the koobideh tasted like Indian spices and any Persian that has had real koobideh knows it should not taste like that at all. The meat wasn't cooked all that great and the rice wasn't cooked properly either.   I was very disappointed with the food, however the service was great- the young lady that helped us was very sweet and again the decor was beautiful.   If you want a nice place for a drink and mediocre hookah, I guess it's worth the shot- as for good Persian food and good hookah, i will have to pass on this next time.",

    "text": "The girlfriend and I would come here weekly sometimes twice a week, it would be our little hangout and unwind spot before going out for the evening and plus we would take advantage of their happy hour. We have been coming here for about 4 years and ran into a problem once but they corrected the problem while there. However tonight is a different story...  12/16/2015 @ 6:30pm We arrived and went to the hookah lounge attached to the restaurant, it was busy as normal for a week night not overly packed we sat down and the waitress came and took our order, she even knew we came here regularly and commented about it. We ordered two waters and a lemon drop hookah - not a complex order by any means but the hookah lasted for 33 minutes 7:03pm I looked at my phone as the waitress never came back around to check our hookah, waters, if we wanted anything else not to even see if things were okay. So let the waiting game begin ... 10 mins turned to 20 ... Which turned into 30 while waiting and having the waitress walk pass numerous times, but her attention was to the gentlemen (whom I believe was the manager off duty - I've seen this man here almost every time we are there and I'm sure that's not by pure coincidence) and his friend to our left, but never rendered service to us until 7:38pm to while I told her I wanted her to fix the hookah but I'll just have the check as the service was horrible. I made sure I paid with my credit card so I would be able to dispute the charge as service was never rendered. I will be avoiding this place and going to the other hookah lounge our friends go to more often, this place was good but now the service look like lost puppy dogs running around without a clue.   Overview: Service is poor Hookahs are okay Food is good   I would not recommend this place to anyone anymore.",

We waited at the entrance for a good 5 minutes but no sign of a waitress or hostess. Awkward. Once we were seated, I was pretty pumped to give this place a go. The decor is great and it was obvious that people were having a great time in the hookah lounge.   The food was probably the worst I've had in the area, and I don't say that lightly. We ordered the appetizer sampler, which was lackluster. I'd rather buy hummus from the store. The fries were pretty gross - couldn't place the spices they used, but definitely not my taste. The falafel was alright but I've had better.   My friend ordered the kabob sampler. The lamb was OK, nothing to get excited about. I didn't care for the chicken much either. Something about it didn't sit right with me.   The deal breaker was the ground beef kabobs. My only description of them wouldn't be appropriate, so let's just call them straight up nasty. They were warm and cooked on the outside but the insides were cold and total mush. I have never sent back food in my life, but I can only imagine the sickness that would result if I didn't. When they came back, they were practically burnt on the outside (as kabobs should be I guess?) and the insides were slightly more solid. I've had kabobs at plenty of other places in town and in my travels, but I never have experienced this. SUCH a disappointment... It was really gross. The rice was ok but tasted really greasy, and the stewed tomato thing on the side tasted slightly of soap. The waitress offered to send it back a 2nd time but at that point I was over it and the thought of eating more turned my guts. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but they did it anyway, which was nice.  I'd go back to try out their hookah lounge and have drinks, but I'll be avoiding the food. I hope it was just a fluke but not willing to dump money down the drain again.",

Here at Sahara the food is mostly great, the atmosphere is wonderful It's just a beautiful anf fun decor. The service is not as attentive and you need to ask questions ( Are refills free? etc ) because they might not tell you.   The chicken parm was a disappointment  last time we went ( Pounded down flat to make it look bigger, gimmee a break) and the salad was smaller than usual ( I would not have ordered had I known).   However the mousakka rocks , the iced tea is good and you can't beat 25% off night.  Overall most of the place is worth it. Just remember to ask some key questions as this location is more about cash than service.",

Annoying,  obnoxiously loud and becoming more & more intoxicated with every moment. Eventually, as we we're eating our lovely dinner, she vomited all over her table. Ran to the bathroom, also in our view, and continued to vomit there. Maybe it was the hookah or the drinking or the combination of both, but she ruined our dinner and we never went back. It's literally been 3 years. We were just saying how much we missed that place but I can't get that image out of my head. Yuk! Sorry. The Maryland parkway location is way too far to travel to.",

The server who took my order was lovely, and provided me with one of their late night menus which is more limited and doesn't provide any pasta options. Just fine with me, I came in for a salad anyway.  The wait for the food was short, and it was packaged nicely when I got home. I ordered the Greek salad which came with romaine, red onion, pepperoncini, feta, tomatoes and olives. The olives were quality with the pits still in them, and the pepperoncini were served whole in the salad. The tomatoes you could tell had been refrigerated for a while as they had no taste except to be slightly sour with a mealy texture. The feta was dry and grated which was very strange to me. I prefer a creamier, softer feta, the kind that comes packed in water. I usually associate dry feta with poor quality. The vinaigrette was thin, thank goodness as I hate syrupy dressings, but I still added some red wine vinegar to my salad at home because it lacked the acidity I was looking for. I also got a side of rice, and it came with white basmati rice topped with some saffron basmati rice. It was decent, but tasted heavily of butter. I can only imagine how much they probably used when steaming/reheating it.  The ambiance here was very pretty and I can see this easily being a nice late night lounge for locals who live nearby. But the food quality was lacking in authenticity for me, and I think I'll stick to my favorites unless I'm in a late night bind.",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic food. The hummus and pita app was great. I had a falafel on pita sandwich. It was the best I've had in years. Staff from hostess, waitress and busboy were all very happy and friendly. Walking up to restaurant, I was doubtful. A hookah lounge was not my idea for a place to eat lunch, but my daughter had been there before. Its in a small strip mall and an old one at that. But when we walked in, I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly and attentive staff. The hummus was creamy and the pita warm and fresh. The only problem with my sandwich was the falafel was a bit too large and kept rally out of sandwich. Very small problem. I'll definitely be back, next meal will be the moussaka! Give it a try!",

The meat in the gyro I got was kind of chewy and not very fresh, and they piled all the lettuce and veggies at the bottom half of the pocket pita and the meat on the top.

This pretty much sums up my feelings about that:   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F%40luckyshirt%2Fdear-guy-who-just-made-my-burrito-fd08c0babb57&s=9d014e4f531f1e0033a6a7676e92584efbda337ce9fecd422e79c0fd5240f54f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">medium.com/@luckyshirt/d...</a>  The fries were okay, not blow my mind amazing....just really seasoned...

Both plates were generous in portion. The gyro meat was a little processed looking, I doubt it was actually carved by someone other than a factory worker. But they had delicious sauces, and the seasoning was spot on. The hostess seemed annoyed, but we had a super nice server(Lisa?).  In short: they're pretty alright. Not sure if I'll go back, but if I was taken there I wouldn't run.",

    "text": "Even though Paymon's is a bit overpriced I have such warm fuzzy feelings for it. I had my first date with my boyfriend there. It was his pick. Yay for originality!  I like that there is a bit of flexibility in their dishes. I can have pasta, or curry or gyros. So there isn't a big fuss if a group of us want to eat there and all have different tastes. My usual for quite awhile was the broiled steak kabob. The meat is always very tasty (but not always the most tender) and the basmati rice fluffy and nicely spiced. The vegetables are always overcooked. Not that I'm a bit fan of them anyway but I might be more enticed to eat them if this was not the case.  My current favorite is the chicken curry. I get it about medium spicy but then I cover it in their racy red sauce. I could pour that on just about everything it's so good. The hummus is my  mom's favorite dish. I like it too but it is so filling that I usually can't finish my entree if we get it as an appetizer. The gyros are nice, the meat is not dry and they are really smashing with a side of Athens fries. The sauce that comes with the fries is pretty addictive.",

It was a bit busy, there were several big tables reserved and/or seated already, but we were able to get a table.  We started with a couple of apps, the first were the Athen's fries, it had been given many good reviews, but they were just well seasoned fries with a dipping sauce other than ketchup.  The second app was the a combination of hummus and baba ganosh, now these were both good!  For my entree I ordered Moussaka, it was a layered casserole of sliced eggplant, onions, potato, ground beef, fresh herbs and spices, covered with behamel sauce and served on basmati rice and vegetables.  I really enjoyed this.  Overall, a good experience, service was excellent, the food was flavorable and met my expectations, but a bit pricey .",

    "text": "Love, love, love this place!  I was lucky enough to be invited to my first UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at Paymons.  Lots of good eats, great conversation, service and atmosphere.  The perfect mix of Greek, Indian, some Italian and I loved that there were a ton of Vegetarian options!  Appetizers: I had the infamous Athens Fries, which lived up to their reputation.  The spice really added to the fries and the sauce was delish.   I kept trying to figure out what was in the sauce as if I were at a wine tasting.. lol..  never did figure it out, but well worth it!   The hummus with pesto sauce was bomb.  Adding the pesto sauce probably took away from the healthy factor, but, when in Rome...  Entrees: I ordered the Chicken Curry (mild) and my other half had the Chicken Tandoori.  The flavors were perfect and not overly spicy.  We were both part of the clean plate club.  Unfortunately, I didn't leave room for dessert.  I highly regretted this when I got home.  Next time, I must indulge.  Mama's Baklava is calling my name.    As far as drinks, they had a great wine list, a killer margarita and their unsweetened tea was so good, it was almost as if it were sweetened.  As a southerner, I'm not a fan of iced unsweetened tea, but they make it work!  There were also a variety of warm tea to choose from.. Lots of green tea, Mango, Earl Grey, Spiced Chai, etc..etc..  A perfect way to end a meal!  The service was perfect!  We were a large party (around 20 peeps) and I don't think there was a single hiccup.  I was also impressed with how the server was able to effortlessly split about fifteen different tabs.  If only I could remember his name!  Shame on me.  I didn't check out the Hookah Lounge; Shisha tends to give me a headache.  Maybe next time.  Great food!  I'll be back!",

I asked for lemons and had to wait for 10 minutes to remind the server. When our entrees came we had 2 steak skewer plates one medium well and med rare. My side salad was warm as they probably left it under the warmer while they waited for the meat to cook. My husbands meat was beyond rare not even close to med rare. He always orders a side of the veggies and the veggies were soggy and watered down. To top things off we could see one of the cooks eating while he was cooking. Major health violation and made me lose my appetite.",

There is a dinning area that is separated from the hookah lounge which was cool. They also serve food in the lounge and drinks. I really like the decor they have in the lounge it was Egyptian themed. We ordered the skittles flavor which is pretty light from what I usually smoke but it was nice. They have a dance floor and a dj tonight when I went. It was a mixture of pop and Cumbia. It's a very chill homey environment. The employees came by to check on us every so often and refilled our glass of water. It was pleasant. I do wish it was a bit more hyped for a Friday night, but it was relaxing. We didn't get to try the food so I have no opinion in that area. Update* so I came back day 2 of my trip to Vegas and they don't allow coal changes and you only get one coal. That's quite unheard of. I was like 0.o not sure how I even feel about that. In order to get a new coal we would have to order a refill. . . .",

We had the baba ganush, falafel, she had the steak kebabs and I had the koobideh. The baba ganush was a bit bland but ok. The falafel was mediocre - over fried/too crispy for my taste. My cousin ordered a roasted tomato on the side. It was barely roasted and cold when it arrived. Our dinner platters honestly were the only thing that we were fully satisfied with. Our hostess wasnt terrible but she wasnt great either. We asked for to go boxes and she brought the boxes with the check and left, leaving us to do it ourselves. Okay no biggie. To leave an honest review Id have to give them 3 1/2 stars for the overall food and service. Regardless we didnt complain and we did leave a decent tip. We spent $65 between the 2 of us and to pay that much I would have expected to have a better experience. I remember their food and service being a lot better when they first opened up but that was many years ago. Seems to have downgraded a bit since then.",

I live like a block away from the Summerlin location and I order from there a lot, out of convenience. I recommend the food for the most part. It's a 6.5 out of a 10 on a good day.  If you want a good hookah experience, go to an authentic Middle Eastern place, these guys think that a hookah is when you slap some tobacco on a water pipe-it's just not that great and a bit grainy, but it's good for anyone who doesn't have or care for high hookah standards. It's a 3 out of 10.   The lounge service is the WORST of the WORST in Las Vegas - the worst. If you are hanging out and/or eating here, expect to be ignored, with a bunch of dirty plates on your table all night, wait 20 min for a beer, good luck getting a water, they are clueless about the menu and everyone is incapable of even saying a proper hello. You will never see the management around and especially won't see them taking any interest in patrons. I'm very easy going but their service is just unbelievable. It's 0 out of 1,000.

The Eggplant seemed a little undercooked for me. But that's more of a preference.   The ground beef kabobs have what I think is all spice  and  tasted off to me.   Not typical Persian food. The meat was undercooked and I was afraid of getting sick if I ate it.  \"Luckily\" I  found a very fine thing long hair in my food and lost my appetite after that.   The baklava was good.

The menu offers an odd mix of Mediterranean, Italian, and vegetarian dishes, with higher price tags than I initially expected- but the quality is also much higher than I was led to expect!  There are several kabob plates, the KOOBIDEH PLATE  ($13) is solid with sides of saffron rice, house salad, and roasted tomato. By far my favorite dish here though, is the EGGPLANT PITA WRAP ($9) with roasted veggies, feta, and pesto sauce. Add on a side of ATHENS FRIES ($3) with their unique dipping sauce, and ask them to bring some tzatziki too. It's a flavor and texture explosion, in the best of ways.  They also have different spices, cookbooks, and gifts for sale right inside the front door. Takeout service is quick and friendly. Wednesday evenings there is a local's appreciation discount.",

I had emailed prior asking if seperate checks would be an issue and how many they could accommodate doing that. Whoever answers their FB or email said it was doable for 12. They must have failed to relay that to the restaurant. Food was mediocre. I always give places a second try. Hope it's better on round 2.",

Curry chicken with basmati rice - freshly grilled chicken in a light, but very flavorful curry sauce. This meal takes a little bit more time to be prepared, so if you don't have to much time to wait, you might get impatient. When I like to eat very light, I just order one of the Panini sandwiches. Tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese, grilled. Very yummy!  Besides the full bar, they serve bottled water in the perfect size of 500ml, S.Pellegrino.   Service is always very attentive.  Wednesday's special: 25% off of entire bill!",

It's a great, quiet place to catch up with friends and there's a live DJ on Friday and Saturday nights to shake things up a bit.  Tuesdays boast great deals on drinks and appetizers in the hookah lounge and there's always 25% off your entire bill in the restaurant every Wednesday.  Can't beat that!",

Like i had mentioned in my previous review.. i started ordering the angel hair pasta in replace of rice for the chicken curry one visit a newly employed server said she could not grant that request because i was not allowed to modify the rice & questioned me how long have ive been dinning here? .. real question is, how long have you been working here? But its understandable, you are just doing your job. Last visit, requested same order.. they forgot my pasta and gave rice. Had to wait to bring new one..of course pasta was just cooked they did not drain the pasta well that the overly wet pasta made my curry like soup. Hmm idk about this place anymore?",

I haven't given up hope, but there is a serious problem in our relationship that needs to be addressed: your terrible bread!  I've been coming to Paymons for years, you've always been my fave! I take everyone to Paymons! But lately your bread is so awful. What's the point of delicious hummus and kabobs and salads and pitas if they are paired with stale cold hard bread! Your competitors bring out hummus and make pitas with fluffy bread full of piping hot air right out of the oven. Lately you've been pairing your amazing food with something I think you pulled right out of a Sysco bag labeled \"pita from San Bernadino production facility 74ax92.\" It's ruining everything. Not to mention my chicken pita (my fave) the other day was served on a piece of shoe leather.   Please Paymons step up your bread game. This goes for your your other location too. Fix this problem and we're back to a five star relationship. Thanks.",

So, it's really a matter of where we are when we get that Mediterranean craving and we love Paymons.  My favorites: Combination Platter ($13.95) Moussaka ($13.95) Broiled Kabob Trio ($20.95)  All of their flame-broiled meats are packed with flavor and so very yummy with their basmati rice and house salad. I love the trio platter since it comes with three types of meat that are cooked with different seasonings (I hate to decide and I just love the variety). I feel the same way about the Combination Platter. It comes with EIGHT different items! It's the best dish to order if you want to try multiple specialties or just sharing with the table. My favorites on the platter are the Athens Fries, Falafel, and Baba Ganoush.

    "text": "We stopped here for something different.  I had looked at the menu online and decided on the kebab trio--a dinner with koobideh, chicken, and lamb kebabs.  Served with the meal are vermicelli pilaf, basmati rice, a house salad, and grilled tomato and red pepper.  I started my meal with a cup of their summer soup available for a limited time.  It's a cucumber yogurt cold soup with walnut pieces and golden raisins for a touch of sweetness.  The soup was topped with some croutons and garnished with a sprig of mint.  It was excellent!  Very different and very refreshing.  For the main course, the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us.  My wife does not like lamb.  By sharing the trio, I was able to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh.  Of the three, the koobideh was the star of the dish.  The lamb was cooked too much--I had requested rare and it was more on the medium side.  It was also a bit tough.  The chicken was OK but there wasn't much spice to it.  The koobideh, on the other hand, was done medium rare as I asked and it was flavorful and very enjoyable.  For dessert, my wife got the rice pudding (it was very good), and I got an order of baklava--also very good.  Service was not the best.  We waited at the podium for about 5 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  My iced tea wasn't refilled in a timely manner and even though there were only a few other diners in the room, our server seemed to disappear for long periods of time only checking back with us once near the end of our dinner.  I also thought it was a bit tacky to take the dessert order, enter it into a nearby terminal, and then put the bill on the table before clearing the dishes and well before dessert was brought.  Bad form.  If I decide to come back, it will be for takeout, but with other choices in the area for Mediterranean food, I probably will go elsewhere.",

All came in a little under $60.   They had a DJ playing live music videos and there was a cool little dance floor. I believe this started at 10pm on Saturday. They have open seating but a reservation might be needed for a bigger party.   I wouldn't say the food is phenomenal, but the portions were nice and it paired well with the hookah which was reasonably priced.   I enjoyed my night. Good hookah and good vibes. I'll need to come back for all night happy hour with half off drinks and hookah on Tuesdays.",

The interior of the restaurant is vibrant with color with painting and plants around the tables. The music that plays in the background is very lively and adds another dimension to the experience. The staff is friendly and checks up on your party regularly.  I ordered a gyro pita was rather disappointed with what I received. It did not have the spirit of what a gyro should have, for it did not have much flavor or seasoning to it. The rice was ok but was rather dry and boring. Despite this, the fries are absolutely incredible. They are seasoned and well-cooked; the fries are like no other fries I've ever had. The value of the meal for one person is reasonable.  I usually enjoy Mediterranean food, but trying the food at this place turned me off from enjoying other aspects of Mediterranean food. I might come back again for the fries, but that would be the only thing I would order again.",

And listen, I make $13 an hour piercing belly buttons at Claire's, so I have the income ok? The green backs. The restaurant was dimly lit, slightly empty, clean, and comfy. Kind of like a swingers club. The server brought us the yummiest \"Babylon Spice\" cocktail. Randall had a virgin one (because he breaks out in hives on and around his skittle sized nipples if he drinks alcohol). He was also a little under the weather because the night prior, he drank his first Reb Bull and forced me to pierce his belly button which immediately got infected. We ordered the falafel and the Bruchette Salad and told Pepe, our server, to hold the fucking queso, but guess what ended up in my mouth when I took the first bite? We didn't make a scene, because we were already asked to leave a PT's two days prior for throwing jalapeno poppers at a man in a wheelchair and telling him to dance. Whatever. Thanks Obama. The falafel was standard, but hit the spot. The salad was a delish dish, but Pepe did catch Randall spitting some cheese into the fake plants next to the table. When we left, there was 5 little piles of regurgitated cheese in the planter. Pepe was tipped well, so we didn't feel bad. It's pretty hard to fuck up falafel and a salad, but I still had a great night. I dumped the entire dish of complimentary mints into my purse and just before opening the door to leave, screamed out \"Dicks out for Harambe\", but then I realized the door was locked because they were closing for the night and Pepe had to come awkwardly let us out. Whatever Pepe. Get over yourself.",

    "text": "The food here is truly hit or miss because Paymons really lacks consistency with flavor. They have an extensive menu with a nice mix of different foods, HOWEVER...the flavors seem muddled down and bland. I've visited Paymons about 3 or 4 times now and between all the visits I have tried...  Chicken Curry: No curry flavor, tastes like someone dashed seasoning in a pot of heavy cream. Calamari: GREAT Baba ghanouj: Just okay..lacked smoked flavor Chicken Tikka: Decent, didn't really taste the seasoning/marinade. Salmon with grilled vegetables: Salmon cooked well, vegetables always overcooked and limp. Chocolate Cake: They claim this is from Cheesecake Factory, but I don't know about that...it was stale and flavorless when I had it Pistachio Gelato: Came out half melted and tasted like artificial pistachio extract.  Hookah: These take a while to come out, and depending on who makes it, you may or may not find a problem with it. One time it was perfect, the other time it was harsh, had too much water, and burned within 20 minutes.   I suppose I'll return because the service is always wonderful and it's a beautiful setting..I just won't order  what I didn't like, though it is frustrating that they market themselves as a Mediterranean restaurant but their Mediterranean food needs work.",

If you're willing to deal with service where they forget your order on two different visits, say something is on happy hour but charge full price since they forgot to ring it in 15 minutes earlier, than this is the place for you. The food though is delicious and the happy hour is 7 day's a week.",

I literally waited 20 minutes at the front waiting to be seated. I saw a few waiters walk by but was not acknowledged. Eventually a male waiter came by to seat us.  They have a late night menu. The only difference with this menu is that they do not have the pasta offerings as they do during the day. I ordered the combination appetizer to taste most of their appetizers. That was worth it! It came with a very big portion. I also ordered the pita gyro and the chicken kabobs. Both very delicious meals. I also ordered the greek rice pudding to go. That was so yummy, it's a must!   The waitress was nice and everything, but they should really work on having someone at the door to sit people, cause standing there for 20 minutes was a complete waste of time.",

    "text": "Dropped in here Friday night around 8pm for another Hookah session with my friend. I've been to Paymons several times in the past.  Tonight it was a bit loud, with a large group nearby who were basically yelling because the music was a bit too high. The music was electronic, and for the first hour it felt like the same song, over and over and over again. Drop the volume level and pick a new song....geez. Eventually some DJ came on and the music got a little better, but by that time we were just about to head out the door.  Service is good, shisha is good...not as many varieties and flavors as Azuza. Paymons is a nice spot to hang out and enjoy a little smoke. They might be the only place on the westside that offers Hookah and serves alcohol, as all the other places we searched did not offer booze.",

Sad thing is, the food is great but the service was horrific. We ordered our drinks and appetizer and she did not come back to take our order for a long time. She finally did, and was so rude and I had to point out the entree I wanted. When the food arrived it was the wrong item! While my husband ate his meal I sat there waiting. When he was finished eating it finally arrived. Our server came back, and with a snarky attitude said not to worry she took the sandwich off and apologized sarcastically. We didn't order it! I am in disbelief on how awful this experience was. Nov 4 6:30 pm. management and ownership may want to give Haley tips on how to treat customers. If you are in the mood for excellent mediterranean dishes and excellent service, check out Stephanos Mediterranean instead.",

I found this place originally because it came up high in a Google search result by zip-code for Vegan restaurants.  The menu is an interesting and very unique \"fusion\" between several different cultures, and is so varied you could come in 100 times and have 100 different meals before you run through all the options.  Although I don't make it to this part of town very often, when I do come in, almost every time there is at least one staffperson who remembers my name and my meal choice (I'm one of those guys who goes to a few select places and orders the same thing every time).  Impressive because I'm not exactly Norm at Cheers when it comes to this place, and it shows they make a genuine effort to appreciate customers.  Whenever I have visitors in town, I try to bring them here if time or schedule permits.",

From what I see in the pictures, the Hookah lounge is gorgeous, but I didn't get to see it since we were just here for lunch. The waitress sat us in a booth a quickly brought out our water and told us what she recommended.   We ordered: Fried Calamari ($9.50) - Topped with grated parmesan cheese and served with spicy marinara sauce.  Pastitsio ($12.95) - layered casserole made with lean ground beef, Barilla pasta, tomato, parmesan cheese, and several herbs and spices. Topped with bechamel sauce, oven baked and served on a roasted tomato coulis. Served with Mediterranean vegetables.  Gyro ($8.75) - Slices of beef and lamb, served with fresh romaine lettuce, red onions, tomatoes and Greek tzatziki sauce. +Athens fries for $2.95 extra  To be honest, I found this all to be a little overpriced. Our bill came out to be over $40 with tip because we also ordered iced tea and a soda. However, the food was very good. The meat in the Gyro was very tender and the fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. I don't know what kind of dipping sauce they gave us with the Athens fries, but it was addicting. The Pastitsio was very flavorful although a little too heavy for my liking, so I probably wouldn't order it again. The calamari was heavenly; Lightly breaded, tender, and oozing with flavor Parmesan/herb goodness. The marinara sauce was an added bonus. I normally prefer my Calamari with marinara as opposed to aioli.   If it weren't for the regular menu being a tad overpriced, I would give this place an easy 4 stars. I just don't think I can justify the Gyro and fries being about $12 and the Calamari being $9.50. I'll have to come back again during happy hour when Calamari is only $4.75, so I can add on another star ;)  *Tips -Customer Appreciation Night: Wednesdays from 5-9pm, 25% off bill -Tuesdays: from 5pm-1am all specialty cocktails, beer, mixed drinks, hookahs and lounge food at 50% off -AYCE pasta for $8.95",

Also the hookah attendant was informative and helped my friends select their flavor with great suggestions on their preferences.

She went as far as asking if we had ever been a server and pretty much saying we didn't have a right to complain or be accommodated with split checks. Her attitude from the start was less than favorable and put a bad taste in our mouth. Come in Ben! He was amazing, great attitude, immediately went  around and took our orders with no complaints. He split the checks at the end of our meal and turned a bad taste to a great team lunch!  Thank you so much Ben!   Unfortunately due to Marissa's initial irritated attitude many of our team members will not be returning to this establishment.  Thank you",

    "text": "Paymons is one of my favorite Mediterranean establishments in Vegas! I have never tried the Hookah lounge, so my review is based only on the restaurant side. First off, I have to mention the decor. I love the way it's decorated, and I think that it adds to the ambiance of the establishment.   The menu is quite extensive with your typical Mediterranean offerings with some Italian and Indian thrown in. I usually get one of the kabob platters. The meat is high quality and the portions are very large, I usually end up taking about half home. They not only give you normal rice typically seen at a Greek or Persian restaurant, but another dark colored spice rice, which is my favorite!  I believe they do 25% off for locals on Wednesdays. It gets a little busy, but nothing unreasonable.",

It is a bit pricey though, wish it was a few bucks cheaper.  The hookah lounge can get pretty crowded on the weekends.  One time there was a big party and it was so loud we had to ask to be moved to the outdoor patio in order to hold a conversation.  You only get one coal though (it lasts a long time) but they will adjust if the hookah gets harsh, but not replace the coal unless you buy a new head.",

The tzatziki on the tender gyro meat was garlicky,  creamy perfection.  The salad was dressed with a light, tangy vinaigrette kissed dill, plump, briny olives,  juicy tomatoes and spicy red onion. The dish was visually appealing as well as pleasing to the palette.  Portion size was generous.  The drinks were surprisingly pricy as the food menu was quite moderately priced. Drink prices aside, Paymon's will be one to revist.",

Not one person new anything about the lunch and the girl working up front simply laughed and said, \"Oh well, someone must have forgot to put the order in, haha!\" I asked to speak with a manager and was informed there are no managers on duty.

We have tried Rhumbar and Azuza also, but they just dont compare!  We arrived at around 11:30pm, and the restaurant was very empty.  The lounge was nearly full, bumpin 80s music with a live DJ.  The seats were very comfortable, bf was very happy.  The service was great too, very nice girls and friendly to all their patrons.  We just came from a concert, so we were starving.  Bf ordered the Tandoori Chicken and loved it.  I ordered the gyro plate which also came with their signature Athens Fries... HOLY MOLY forget the fries, the GYRO was awesome!  In Hawaii, all Greek and Mediterranean food is pretty standard and nothing mind-blowing.  Paymons serves a JUMBO gyro and they do not skimp on ANY ingredients.  Loved it, but I couldnt finish it.    We read about the Thief flavor shisha, and we ordered a bowl of that.  There was margarita mixed with several other flavors.  It was tasty! We also ordered a bowl of the Cherry Bomb shisha, which I thought tasted a lot better, more flavorful.    There was a lot of funky music playing, and the music videos for the songs were also on the TVs on the walls.  This lounge is spacious and has a great vibe, dont be shy to get up and dance!   Only thing I would have changed is to not sit near the A/C vent so I can do my smoke tricks...lol  I definitely want to come back again, but with a bigger group, its a great late-nite spot to get away from The Strip and just have fun.",

    "text": "I went to the Hookah lounge last night (Tuesday, May 14) with a friend. Tuesdays they have all-day happy hour in the lounge (which means half-price hookah, drinks, and some appetizers)! It gets a bit crowded which may not be for everyone, but I think it makes for a more fun vibe. They tend to start playing electronic music later in the night on Tuesdays as well (I have heard they also do this on weekends).  I give them four stars mainly for overall atmosphere in the lounge and selection of the hookahs. They have a huge assortment of hookah flavors - at least 25 that you can mix and match, and you can also choose liquids other than water for the bottom of the hookah. My only complaints are that the hookahs take phenomenally long to come out (I can never understand why this part takes so long - the drinks and even the food arrives before the hookah!) and they won't refill coals - you just have to order a new hookah flavor. But, the music is good and the seating is comfortable, so the wait doesn't bother me enough to stop going.  The food is good, but not exceptional. It's decent middle eastern food for Las Vegas, but like I said, if it weren't for the great vibe in the hookah lounge, I wouldn't go for the food alone. The hummus, baba ganoush, and meat dolmas are my favorite appetizers, and the lamb skewers are a great entree. I wouldn't recommend going to this place for dinner, but I would hands-down recommend going to have a fun night smoking hookah and grabbing some drinks with friends.",

We decided to grab a late dinner on Wednesday night with some friends from France and the main door to the restaurant was closed so we seated ourselves in the lounge to grab some food. I spoke to the bartender to get a menu and after a few minutes he returned and notified us that we could not sit in the lounge because one of our friends had a tank top on, so he walked us into the main dining room thru an interior door. We all ordered hummus and Baba ghanoush (which is delicious!) and our main courses. I ordered meat Dolmas, my husband ordered Felafel and our guests ordered Chicken Kebab. All the food was very good, as always. Not being able to sit in the lounge because of a tank top was kind of weird but eh whatever. Love this place and excited for many more meals here!",

    "text": "Just driving around, looking for something different to eat. Saw the sign and wandered in. Paymon's could best be described as a middle-Eastern-fusion place, no that doesn't quite describe it. First of all the interior is breathtakingly beautiful; and the ambience is matched by the food. They have Greek, Italian, Indian, and Persian dishes (in alphabetical order), and sandwiches, all very reasonably priced. We started with a combination of dips and pita bread: hummus and yogurt-cucumber (actually tzatziki but who can pronounce that?). Next was the lentil soup with melted feta cheese. One of us had Tandoori chicken and the other had chicken curry, both out of this world.  Now an aside. There were two Las Vegas Metro Police officers seated adjacent to us, and that day was the day they buried one of two officers who, a week earlier, had both been shot in the head and killed while dining in a restaurant. Now the Las Vegas cops are awesome for what they do every day, but I can't imagine how it must feel to sit down for a restaurant meal, after that incident, not knowing if there's some other nutcase who's going to walk through the door and open fire on you. Of course, the fact that cops eat at Paymon's is a recommendation in itself.  I can't wait to get back to Paymon's and check out the rest of the menu, or maybe I'll order the Tandoori chicken the next dozen times. You really owe it to yourself to try this place, it's every bit as good as those fancy Las Vegas Strip hotel restaurants that bear the names of famous chefs who never visit.  Hookah lounge, sealed off from the restaurant (untried). Open 11 AM-1 AM every day, take-out until 8 PM. Cocktails. Credit cards.",

    "text": "Pretty darn good. I have been to the original location several times, this was my first time at the West Side. The Shrimp & Spinach dip is amazing!! Get it before you even look at the menu.  The selection is vast and you will find yourself concerned as you read through, because you will want to try everything. The Combination platter comes with thier amazing Fries, Baba Ganouch, Humus, Stuffed Grapes Leaves and more. It's a meal for 1+.   Further, we went with a Baked Kibbe for a shared entree. Fantastic. The leftovers were great at work today.  The service is very good. We came late, 8:30pm on a Sunday. We waited at the door for about 5 minutes. That sucks, however, Daniel, who turned out to be our server, noticed us, say us, apologized and explained and provided excellent, attentive service throughout the meal. He genuinely cared that we got the right food for us and enjoyed what we had ordered.  Also, there was a crooked painting on the wall. Can't knock points of that, but just sayin' :)",
