The lettuce is crisp, the dressing is flavorful and not heavy, and all the toppings enhance the flavor.   Filet mignon is juicy and perfect. Plain and simple.  Baked potato is classic, soft, and hearty.  Key Lime Pie Martini rimmed with the Graham Cracker Crust is sweet buy not overly. I don't like my drinks too sweet and this one was balanced just right. Make sure they put the graham cracker crust because without it it's still good, but not as great. I went 2 times and they ran out of the graham cracker crust.

I am at a loss to understand some of these 4 and 5 stars, either ridiculous or these people have no sense of taste.  I see the service being rated high and for this restaurant I would agree, but if most of you are like me, I care much more about the cuisine being rated than the service or if there are flowers on the table, etc.  In this case the food was horrendous.  Both my wife and I agreed that this was possibly the single worst meal we have had in over 15 and maybe 20 years.  The seafood smelled and tasted old, the meat was dry and bland, no seasoning to speak of, most of the items were overcooked and virtually inedible.  I jokingly mentioned to my wife that this crappy food would give me diarrhea.....had no idea how prophetic that statement was, as about an hour later it became reality, 'nuf' said. Caveat emptor...don't say I didn't warn you fine folks, Outback has come down a LONG way in quality and taste.  This consumer will not be back.  Cheers.",

My last trip I ordered a ribeye steak, what I got was a strip steak. I called attention to my steak with the waitress and a manager came out and assured me it was a ribeye steak. ...No it wasn't!    As I was with friends, I did not argue with the manager, I smiled politely as I did not want to create a scene.    I buy ribeye steaks all the time, and choose them as my steak at restaurants. I understand the variations in ribeye steaks. What I received that night at outback was not a ribeye steak.    In the future I will pass on the opportunity to dine at this establishment.",

The server Mike F gave me options on everything else we ordered that had an option, down to the lemonade but when I told him and I pointed to the steak and shrimp unlimited deal, he did not ask did I want a filet or sirloin, which I guess the sirloin was the deal, which is what I wanted for $15.99 but he in fact took it upon himself to order me the filet and then bring a bill where it showed they were $28.99 a piece.  Bad thing is that even on this add online, it is very misleading and that is probably why their servers try to get over on their guests as well as the establishment.  Awful advertisement, use better ways to get people in the door and be direct on your promos. I wish I would have asked to speak to a manager but I was trying not to make a seen and in all I  was upset at the server and took it out off his tip.  He definitely should have opted me which steak, I work with servers that do this sort of thing, so I'm very aware. I'm in the industry and this should not have happened.",

Took 25 mins for food to come and my order was WRONG! We asked for BBQ sauce three times from three different waiters and it never came. Rediculous! The service was unbelievably bad. I left a $0 tip!",

    "text": "I was back in forth on whether or not I wanted to write a review for Outback Steakhouse because it is just a family dining chain.  My wife, daughter and I went the other day.  We usually eat here every once and while.  It is close to the house and my wife likes the coconut shrimp.  I usually just order the sirloin steak special they have.  The reason I gave this particular Outback 4 stars is because they are very consistent.  Like I mentioned this place isn't special and it's not Morton's but the cooks get it right most of the time.  I can't remember leaving here and saying man they never cook my steak how I want it.  So, kudos to the cooks for knowing how to cook a piece of meat all while be employed at a steakhouse where that's what you cook 90% of the time.  I also want to add that most of time the wait staff is generally friendly.  Let me also add that this particular Outback gets pretty busy because it's in a tourist area by the outlet mall.  The one service I really enjoy that any restaurant offers is the ability to put your name on the list as you are getting ready to drive over the place.  This is something they let you do and I highly recommend it unless you really like sitting on those awesome padded benches!  Cheers!",

    "text": "Normally, I wouldn't review a chain restaurant but the service warranted me to write a review.  This review is more for the service rather than their food.  OK, first thing first, when we got sat down, our server took our drink order. She got our drink and brought our complimentary bread and we placed our order.  It took 15 minutes to get our Blossomin' Onion.  As if that wasn't enough, it took another 20 for our main dishes to get to the table.  I guess the server saw us getting annoyed and gave us a weird excuse that their computer went down.  That is such a bunch of bull because the people that got seated AFTER us got their orders no problem.  I would rather her to have told the truth rather than making a BS excuse that didn't make any lick of sense.  So we got our food after over 30 minutes has passed and I do have to say, their food is prepared well and tasted good.  We ate our dishes with gusto.  When we finally got our check,after waiting for what seemed like forever after we finished our food (10 mins of waiting) and another 5 mins to get the change.  We spent more time waiting than eating.  Now I usually give at least 20% for gratuity, but for this instance, we gave about 12% so she would know the service was blah.  At that point, I was over the service.",

    "text": "First, let me state that my family LOVES Outback. This is our \"go to\" restaurant when we want to celebrate anything. We ended up eating here on Memorial Day when the place we were headed did not work out. We were seated and our server came right away to take our drink orders. She was friendly and came back quickly with our drinks and bread.  This is where the good review ends. We waited probably over 15-20 minutes and had to ask about our salads. She said the same thing another reviewer said about a computer shutdown. When our salads finally arrived, they were all incorrect. We didn't say anything. Our food arrived another 10 minutes later, but my youngest daughter's meal was not included. We asked where it was. We got a blank look and the server went off to find it. Her meal did not arrive until after the rest of us were done eating. My filet was cooked to perfection, but my potato was cold. I asked if it could be heated and was given another potato. This one was not much better. Normally, when they bring your potato it's so hot that the butter is melting and the potato is too hot to eat right away (just right). My  husband's steak (ordered medium just like mine) was more like rare. He didn't say anything. Oh, and the server never came back. She kept sending others to finish up her job. We were so disappointed! We will not be back to this location again.",

I always rate food with a simple question.  \"Can I cook it better myself at home?\".  The answer for their food is yes, which wasn't always the case.    Unfortunately, their beef quality has declined over the years.  Their beef is too lean.  With steak, fat is flavor.  Without the fat, even a perfectly cooked med-rare steak will be dry and tough.   Since we keep returning, I keep hoping that it's just a consistency problem.  Sadly, it's consistent low quality.  There are a few steak restaurants in nearby local casinos, with prices within $10 of Outback, with much better beef quality.  After a tough Outback steak, I almost always leave feeling like I wasted good money.",

So I order 5oz steak and lobster my side was a salad with ranch server drop off salad I ask for an extra ranch and never got it. Main meal came the 5oz steak was burnt barely saw the server after that never offered dessert after finished with the meal.

I have eaten at this outback at least twenty five times for lunch and dinner. Weather in a small group of two, or with my coworkers at ten plus the quality and service have always been consistently good. For lunch the various lunch specials involving the soup and salad are definitely worth a try. Among my favorite items are the house salad and the potato cheese soup. The burger is great for lunch as well, especailly if you get it medium to medium well done. For dinner the blooming onion and an ice cold Fosters is a great wait to kick off your meal. The steaks are all tasty, my go to is the filet mignon also medium. If you find yourself on the south end of the strip looking for a quality eat spot stop in and grab a bite.",

Ordered the 6oz sirloin w/sweet potato for $10.99, also came with a 8oz (wow) beer. Then I saw an ad for a lobster tail@$9.99 Damn it! Had to have it! The steak tasted great and sweet potato never disappoints. Lobster - NO BUENO!  Presentation was nice but then I took the meat off the shell and . . . Well, look at the pic I took. Size of a crawfish tail, well maybe an inch bigger. I was able to cut it in 3 pieces. Ate TEN DOLLARS in less than 5 minutes. Come to think of it, I loss the same amount in 5 minutes gambling too. If ever I return, it'll just be to meet others that wanted to eat here. Not my 1st choice.",

    "text": "Very disappointed.  I use to love the Outback special whenever I would come eat here, but the last few times I have been here the steak has been chewy and dry.  Tonight took almost an hour to get our food.  We had my step daughter with us and she was starving by the time her food came (which most restaurants make a point to bring her food early since she is 3 without us even asking).  We will probably not be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Excellent food, and very willing to cater to special requirements.  Gluten free? Not a problem. Want just carrots instead of the mixed veggies? Ok!  Salad with extra cucumbers and no tomatos, np.  Their croutons are made there, and a bit spicy.  Mmm, delicious.  I love Outback.  Today I had a crispy chicken sandwich, a baked potato, and a house salad.  I'm a supertaster (basically 1/3 of the population can taste Prop, a bitter flavor in many vegetables) and their salad is rarely overly bitter, which really makes me feel \"normal\" when I can enjoy a salad.  The baked potato, as always, was properly cooked, which is rare in restaurants to be able to get a baked potato that is actually cooked all the way through (Not sure how people can enjoy jason's deli or memphis bbq potatoes where they're actually still hard).  Butter, bacon, and cheese.  No extra upcharge for the bacon and cheese.  The crispy chicken sandwich was a nice surprise.  Its on their new brioche bun which was amazing, it had folds, a good flavor, soft on the top, and was properly crisped on the grill.  You know the bun is right when after you pick it up to take a bit and put it down, your hand has \"impressed\" on the bun changing its shape.  The aroma told it all though, it was a real buffalo sauce!  Not Frank's red hot sauce, which is a fine hot sauce, but isn't buffalo sauce at all. This was a mixture of butter and hot sauce, and was delicious.  So delicious. :)  Here is a tip, instead of ordering the cheese fries you can't finish, just get french frys and add cheese and bacon for a buck more.  They'll even give you the same ranch sauce!",

    "text": "This review was for last nights meal. Our server was Anthony and he was very attentive and helpful. The reason for the three star review was the quality and portion size of the food. My husband ordered the ribs and chicken plate. This is where the food portions became comical, he ordered a wedge salad, it was large and seemed  proportional. Then the main course came out. The chicken breast was the size of a child's fist and the ribs consisted a 5 very small ribs. This cost of this meal was $16.49 plus a $1.00 upgrade charge for the salad. The server who brought our food even made a comment to how small the food looked on the plate. The cost of this meal for three people was over $100.00. One was a kid. We felt sad as we left and not happy.  The prices were not in line with the size and quality of the food.  Sadly we probably won't be going back to Outback, there are too many options to get quality food.",

Our waiter mixed up my customer's salad by giving him a Ceasar's instead of a green salad.  My sandwich and salad were tasty and the ice tea hit the spot too.    This Outback is actually a great place to meet a client - the booth was  private, not loud and we had a productive sale meeting.",

    "text": "If I could give ZERO stars, I would. I'd honestly go into the negative. We made a \"reservation\" for 8:45, even called in before we arrived. The dumbass (excuse my language) at the podium said \"5 mins, your table will be ready when you're here.\" We get there on time, weren't seated until 930. Oh, and they seated 6 people in a booth. My family and I are not big at all, but even we wouldn't have fit comfortably. The manager offered to get us a drink while we waited, ordered 2 miller lights... 2 seconds later, he asked \"you wanted bud light right?\" Because his friends came in and he stopped in the middle of our conversation to talk to his friends. I nearly lost it. I snapped back and said \"MILLER.\" Dude, you manage an outback, your job really is not that difficult. Our waitress was alright, I suppose... Forgetful but alright. She tried her best. A for effort. We ordered a couple apps, waited and waited and waited and waited. To the point where my dad, brother and I craved a cigarette. So they started walking outside, for a smoke, the dumbass at the podium said \"if you go out, you can't come back in, company policy\" when they told me that, I was livid. I told her, I'm gonna have a smoke, and get my wallet unless you don't want me paying for this dinner. Honestly, it's pretty bad if you start craving a cig in between apps and entree. Anyways, steaks came out... Warm. Ordered medium rare, my steak nearly gave me lock jaw from chewing it so much. We should've saved this horrible experience by eating at the damn chili's next door. I swear, a blind, tasteless person could've cooked a better steak than the chefs in charge of this joint. Sorry to be so harsh, but this is seriously the worst customer service I've ever experienced. I want this meal comped, and matter of fact, I'd like to be reimbursed for my time wasted in this restaurant.   My conclusion, if you want to get treated like nothing, be surrounded by the dumbest staff in America and eat DOG FOOD, then this outback is the right place for you!   To the blond hostess, that sucks so bad at the easiest job in the world... Congrats. You're employee of the month!",

The location makes it subject to being really crowded at times and not at all during others. So, your wait will vary.   We had the coconut shrimp, and no rules Parmesan pasta with chicken. Very good.   My only advice is to avoid the bar if you want to eat and talk. Last time we were there, a group of Australians were drinking and it was very loud.",

    "text": "My sister and I came were hungry and all we wanted was to just go inside, sit down and have lunch. As we walked in, we noticed it wasn't busy at all, there were maybe 3-4 tables being occupied and yet there was no up front to seat us. Finally after 10 minutes of waiting someone comes up and seats us down, that person who sat us down was also our server - who btw, never even greeted us. After 10 minutes he comes back and asks us what we'd like to drink, my sister wanted a midori sour, he looks at her with attitude and asks, what kind? First of all, my sister doesn't really drink and doesn't know anything so she was confused and didn't understand why he asked \"what kind\" of midori sour she wanted. So he sighs really loud and says hold on let me go see what that is. At this point, we definitely didn't like the way he was treating us or his attitude for that matter. After another ten minutes he comes back and was like \"I don't know what you mean by midori sour but this is what the bartender gave me\" and he puts it down on our table and just leaves without even asking if we were ready to order or not. She tried the drink and definitely did not know what she drank, I tried it myself and spat it out instantly, it was definitely not midori sour. What I don't understand is, every single bar I've ever been to, knows exactly what a midori sour is and what really confused me, is the fact that he came to our table and still gave us a drink when he said he didn't know what a midori sour was! When he came back, we told him to take it back because this isn't what we wanted and FINALLY, he asked for our order. Forty minutes later, our food finally comes out. A half hour for just appetizers??? Are you kidding me? And on top of that our waiter just dumped our dishes down on the table and left, didn't even ask if we needed anything.  At this point, we were pissed off and flagged down a different waiter and asked for to-go boxes because of how badly our service was, he apologized. But we still wanted to leave anyways because unfortunately, our waiter was still a douche. Now I remember why I just stick to carry out, because the many times I've dined-in the service was crap!",

I mean it was not as good as my before vegetarian days salads with bacon bits, eggs, cheese, turkey and ham, and all the other sides that come with a salad like....steak and lobster.    As days passed by I realized that being vegetarian would be harder than I thought, my mood started to change I felt like I was growing fangs and I wanted to bite every neck that passed by just to get a little taste of blood, After a week of meat restricted diet I started to feel tired, dizzy, I started to hallucinate.......by now I could eat anything!.... and there it was! I slammed on my brakes.... Roadkill! Couldn't tell what it was, kangaroo, koala or koyote, all I know is that it was bloody and I was starving, I couldn't pass it by, I picked it up and......ok, I'm kidding, I went into the outback steakhouse and ordered a steak, I took my knife and cut it into pieces, as I took my first bite my taste buds screamed with joy and the juices of the steak  ran through my veins like heroin on a drug addict two minutes after being released from rehab. I stared at the baked potato and the vegetables for a minute and decided to skip them... oh what the hell, I'll eat that too, don't want to stop being a vegetarian cold turkey.    When you get the call of the wild and feel the need to feed the beast in you, the outback has a damn good steak!..........mate.    Oh....almost forgot to review the place!   Attentive and friendly service, affordable and good ambiance.            And like the boomerang said....I'll be back!",

    "text": "Most reviewers focus on their meal, while back-grounding any comments on atmoshpere, staff, and management. I'll start instead by commenting on one of the managers who visitted the lobby to offer bite-sized samples of the Victoria's filet to patiently waiting guests. I enjoyed both the class of his guesture and the tasty bite. On this visit,  there were remodeling renovations underway, but the 35minute wait seemed less onerous after the filet sample!    When we were seated, we ordered  our 'usuals' for drinks and a bloomin' onion app. (We order more apps now that Outback offers the smaller \"petals\" portion.) I always enjoy the spicy sauce that onion's served with.--and tonight was no exception.   Our 8 year old orders an adult 1/2 rack of ribs now that she's in a growth spurt; and my wife always enjoys the Alice Springs chicken. (Note, I lived in Australia,  visitted the Alice, and there's no such thing on the menu there! )  This time around,  I got the new chicken tacos,  which had great portions of chicken and toppings to add on. My only issue was how tough tortillas get under a warmer while waiting for the rest of the meals.    Despite the construction and Saturday night bustle, everything was very satisfying, including the wait staff catching kitchen mixups Before they arrived at our table! I say great job everyone and thanks for a good dining experience.",

It was tasteless and dry, I ordered it medium. It was cooked correctly but yuck. And our fries were soggy:(  We would've complained but we were hiking all day and just wanted to go home and chill. Our waiter was great. Its a typical Outback, they all look alike. I will never get a burger there again though, I'd rather Fatburger. I will update if I go again, I'll order something else, I'm sure it'll be good.",

Eat the bread while it's warm because it is soft and delicious, but once it cools down, it's hard as bricks.  I ordered the dinner special of 6 oz. sirloin with a side salad and a loaded baked potato, all for $9.99.  The steak came out the exact temp I asked for.  I'm not a big sirloin fan, but I love steaks in general and this one was particularly good.  They had a filet for $18.99, but that seemed a little excessive for lunch.    The service was fast and we never had to ask our server for anything.  It's a perfect lunch spot if you're feeling like you want a very affordable big meal!",

For starters, we seemed to have four servers who did not communicate with each other. It was bizarre! We had 4 different people ask for our drink order, 3 of them came back to ask about appetizers etc. I appreciate that they were asking us, but it got to be a little redundant and annoying as we were trying to talk and got interrupted every 2 minutes with the same questions. Next, when we very first sat down, I told the first server that it was my husband's birthday while he was in the restroom, hoping that someone would at least tell him happy birthday! Not a word the entire meal. Third, my meal came out extremely burned. Not overcooked, burned to the point that it tasted burned and inedible. I sent it back and it took forever to replace. My husband was 90% done with his meal by the time I got mine! A female manager did come to bring the new plate and said she'd be back in a few minutes to make sure it was ok this time. She never returned. Such a letdown for a birthday meal!",

He seemed frazzled with the 3 tables he did have. It was close to closing time so maybe he was just over his day. Who knows.

If you order the No rules pasta with chicken and shrimp, they used to give you 5 shrimp now they give you 4????  The NY strip used to be 14 oz now it is 12 oz but price went up higher. Used to be that if you ordered a steak it came with choice of soup or salad and a side like baked potato, veggies or something else.  Now you have to pay EXTRA for the meal side item and guess what, price is still the same or higher like they were including the dinner side like they used to. This was my last visit to Outback here ever. Good luck Outback, you don't keep old customers by making the portion size smaller and raise the price.  Hospitality Management 101.",

They do have healthy options everything on their menu that has a little leaf by it [you need to mention the healthy to the waiter] but can be prepared under 600 calories.  I got a salad no cheese no croutons [no fun] to start and a 5 oz grilled [no butter] chicken breast and dry broccoli [fml training sucks].  And if you want to be a piggie pig they have a 4 course meal for $15 which is a GRRRRReat deal.  soup/salad/entree/dessert.  You can't really beat that.  My friend got their wedge salad and I swear the presentation on it was amazing, like 5 star restaurants presentation.  Service can be a little slow at times but this time we got a very nice waiter named Noel [like Christmas] he was very pleasant and attentive.  He obliviously was trained in French culinary/waiter service b/c he bagged all of our lunches w 2 spoons French style, again like you would find in a high end restaurant.",

The hostess was very friendly and and pointed out there was self serve water while we waited. We had reservation and was seated a bit before our actual time which was nice. Our waitress was a bit over the top. She was trying way to hard to be friendly and prompted that she pretty much was like a fly that wouldn't leave. She took our drink order and then as soon as she placed our drinks asked what we wanted for our meals. We kindly said we needed a few more minutes to decide. I kid you not, she walked about 10 feet from us turned around and asked we where ready. This is how the whole night went.. She would not stop asking us if things where alright, if we needed anything and so on.. I mean yeah its nice not to have to want but there is a limit.. But in turn we never had to ask for any refills on our drinks.       Now our meals, they came out promptly and hot. But the portions have reduced a lot. Almost to the point I would say half the size as I remember them being. I ordered the chicken breast and all you can eat shrimp. The breast was a filet and still looked like it come off a Cornish game hen. As I looked around at everyone's plates it was pretty much the same story. I know cost of food goes up, but come on do not raise the prices and cut the size too.. i felt like I was in a old Wendy's commercial ( where's the beef ). The all you can eat shrimp helped my shock over the prices but the shrimp was buffet quality at best, and a bit tough.      Over all it was an ok dinner but i will not be running back anytime soon..",

Normally on a Sat, just like all other restaurants, the wait is about 40-50mins long and that's what is expected but this review was based on a Sunday night. We arrived Sunday night around 7:40pm and when we walked in, there was about 4 people ahead of us and was told the wait was about 15 mins. We told the host this was a party of four adults and two kids so we needed two high chairs. Another party came in after us and was maybe a party of 5 and they were seated ahead of us! They were seated on the North end of the restaurant which had plenty of tables that would have fit 4 adults and 2 high chairs! Not only it took 45 mins to seat only 4 adults and two kids with only 4 people ahead of us on a slow Sunday night and seated a party as big as us ahead of us, but after 30 mins checking in they asked us about our high chair situations. They asked us like they didn't know! 5 more mins we would have walked out and they deserve 1 Star.   Finally being seated they seated us in a more busy area which was on the South side of the restaurant and we couldn't get the 2 high chairs we requested 45 mins ago on a slow Sunday night! Not only that, there was a free table that could have fit all of us but instead we were put in booth that forced us to only have one booster. This was a very disappointing experience before we even had a chance to order water.   The waiter was good, he actually was a lil slow on checking up on us but he did get my son a bowl of grapes a couple of times so that was greatly appreciated. I was already annoyed of the seating situation so considering that the waiter did a good job. Of course the food was good, three of us ordered three different steaks and all three were great so as I mentioned earlier the food bumped up my review to 3 Stars but I was ready to leave and give them 1 stars",

I have been happy with the service, food, and ambiance each time.  The most notable change for me has been the service. Everyone is so pleasant and helpful. Entree times don't overlap the apps and salads, drinks are refilled anytime one gets down to hallway, and there is never a shortage of pumpernickel bread.  The food has been consistent and good. Any time I need a good wood-fire grilled steak or pork chop with some shrimp or a lobster tail to accompany them, I know I can rely on this Outback.  I've got an early schedule most days so dinner comes earlier. There is always the occasional 10-20 min wait time, which I expected each time I get there a little later in the evenings. So it's always best to get here early. Even if you can't get in early, the food is worth the wait.",

    "text": "I came in for my birthday on Wednesday the 27th around 7:30 p.m. . The restaurant was busy and was told it would probably be a 20 to 25 minute weight. Ended up only being about 12-14 minutes and I took a seat and waited for my friend to arrive. I was greeted promptly by Alexis who was our server, I got a drink and then my friend showed up. We both had fillets mine was medium well hers was rare and we got the Bloomin Onion appetizer or I should say the pedals appetizer which was very good and hot. My friend got a Caesar salad I had a house salad with ranch and both of those were good. Once our fillets came out my friends was round and plump and mine was a little more spread out. They said that it was the cut of meat and some times since it was cooked at medium well that loses its plumpness. I'm not too sure about that since I've had a lot of steak at other places and a fillet is always been a good cut and plump. Both of our steaks were cooked to temperature and our order and it was very good. The only slight drawbacks where I had to wait a little bit to get another Coke from Alexis and it was really hot and the manager did come by and asked how everything was and he noticed that it was hot and then made the decision to turn the heat down. Other than those two slight things it was an enjoyable dinner and I will definitely come back here again.",

Our server was amazing but unfortunately I do not know her name. I ordered a bone-in ribeye. Sadly, it lacked so much flavor. I could have made my own steak at home and it would have had better flavor. It was very disappointing. This is definitely not how I remember outback to be. My Husband ordered another type of steak but I don't remember what type and it was too dry and lacked flavor as well. The appetizer my Husband ordered were the Aussie Fries. Definitely not worth $10! Burned fries with just a slab of cheese on top that didn't even go on the whole plate. It sad that our $80 dinner was worth a $10 meal. That's just how bad it was.",

Had the pork chop which was very juicy and tasted great.  the free Bloomin Onion is always a plus when you do your Yelp check-in. But let's get to the Steakhouse salad... I ordered the steak medium, and the first time they brought it out it was just under medium rare. Could not even cut it with a knife very Raw. So the waitress took it away, and instead of just cooking the meat a little longer I waited 10 minutes for them to bring another one and the meat on it was done even less-- more towards the rare side, so I just took the meat off ..and finished my salad with the remaining pork chop. I guess I learned my lesson --next time I will get the filet again. because last time I had it AND IT was GREAT ! To the credit of the manager they did take the salad off the bill.",

They did take a little bit of time returning to take our order, so we put some appetizers in on the little table kiosk.  When the waitress showed up, she took our main order. The service definitely picked up after that because we got our appetizers almost right after. Just as we were finishing those up, our meals came out. All our food came out as ordered and was simply delicious. Also, Not once did my water go empty because they were on top of the drinks.

I had some worries attempting it again - however no sickness occurred, thank goodness. I got the pork chop which came with veggies and I swapped the mashed p's for a loaded baked p. That was a good choice.  The pork chop came with a tangy dipping sauce which was pretty tasty but the chop itself had too much salt and pepper on it, a bit overpowering.  The veggies were yummy, not soggy or over seasoned.  The loaded baked potato was cooked to perfection and had plenty of toppings (butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon bits, chives).  Our server seemed to be overwhelmed that night (it was Valentine's Day, they were super busy).  She took our drink orders and left right away ... didn't even wait to ask if we wanted to order.  As we paid our bill we heard a server next to us explain the specials to his table; some of them sounded really good - we didn't get that info! What gives?  Expect a long wait at prime dinner times, it is a tourist town with over priced restaurants on the strip - I'm sure the chain places near by make bank on people trying to save $$.",

It was fantastic.  He says when he's not in the mood for a full steak at Outback he gets the filet foccacia and I can see why.  We also got the seared Ahi tuna appetizer.  That was also fantastic, especially with the wasabi sauce Outback makes.  The next day before my flight out I was craving the same sandwich so I swung by Outback just a couple hours before my flight.  I went in the bar area this time and ordered the same thing.  I casually mentioned to the waitress that I had to head straight to the airport after eating there, but didn't think anything of it.  They brought my sandwich and salad out in record time!  And I didn't even ask them to hurry it, they just went ahead and did so.  And as previously, the waitress was super friendly.  Despite this location being south of the Strip, it gets super busy, particularly at night... but there are good reasons; great food, and great service.  It's worth the wait.  (I had previously come here at night, saw the long wait, and opted to walk down and try the Dickey's BBQ place... that was a mistake.  I wish I would've just stayed at Outback.)",

    "text": "We have been patrons of the Henderson location for about seven years. Outback is far and above our favorite restaurant, with us visiting about once a month.  Recently, this restaurant relocated.  I agree with the new location in its ease of access and improved parking. It is understandable that the new location has produced a major bump in business however, there has been a large and negative impact on regular customers.    Our wait times have gone from 20-30 minutes to over 90 minutes, call ahead seating has no value in that there is still no reduction in wait times (average 90 minutes), the new staff display a shocking lack of familiarity with the menu,  and the front end staff (understandably overwhelmed) have become curt and indifferent.  As a result, our dining experience has deteriorated dramatically, and has had an impact on our decision as to whether or not to visit Outback for dinner.    Our most recent visit was 8/01, at 6:00PM, table 7, service check 6, and server Jason.  In summation, Outback is no longer our primary choice for our monthly dining experience, and I cannot foresee us returning until management is aware of, and takes action upon, the negatives that have accompanied the relocation.",

We ordered the kids meals first, so that the kids are happy. The kids meals came later then us adults. When the kids meal came out the food was not warm. The server did not give us utensils and we had to ask several times. For the adults the food was good. It would of been nice if the service was better. I am sure the cook did a good job, it is just the server left the food in the window to get cold. Someone should of stopped that food from being left to die in the window.",

Hubby is a chef & hates cooking when he comes home, so we've eaten at quite a number of restaurants.   That said, this place has 1 of the best managers we've ever encountered.  Managers (the good ones, at least) are supposed to welcome patrons & stop by their table at least once: this was what the manager here did when we had dinner here a few months ago.

To me, that means that they're doing something right, since they continue to be very popular.  Every time I'm there, I get the Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail.  I am never disappointed with the meal.  As they are usually on a wait, I opt to sit at the bar for dinner.  Bartenders are always friendly and knowledgeable.  The mixed drinks are good, but consist mostly of ice.  As for cleanliness, I am relatively satisfied.  I've never seen anything unreasonable, but one sink in the men's room sprays water in every which direction, and has been like this for quite some time.  However, I'm not going to let bathroom sinks stand in the way of a good meal, so I will continue to frequent this outback!",

I ate here around 6pm, so the other reviews I read about cold bread and hard butter and non stretchy cheese is fake, around this time at least. Also, this place is very filling. It is easy to get full here, but everything taste good.  The staff constantly asks if you need anything, so they offer great customer service. If you want, there's a machine on the table that allows you play 30 different games for $2, and even order on the device itself! But warning, the cheesecake is super big. A lot bigger than how it looks. Also, the chocolate doesn't taste the best...I didn't eat much since the chocolate ruined the taste.  It was also quite big the texture was a bit rough. Also, I don't have much of an appetite so I ate too much and feel a bit sick, but that's my own fault.",

Every works together as a team in that area - you will get premium service.   My tip - Victoria's Filet, medium, wood fired! If your not a streak eater the fish tacos were unique and yummy!  If you're not watching what you eat get the steakhouse Mac n Cheese!",

As far as wait times and being seated, that went down very well - we were told a possible 20 minute wait but it only took about 12 minutes. I noticed there was no silverware but the hostess did not notice. Our waiter did not notice the lack of silverware either. The waiter was friendly and he was attentive up until he took our order and right after we stated we didn't want any extra bread. I personally have a feeling that some waiters lose interest when they can't get you to buy alcohol or extra appetizers and that is ridiculous because I tip very well. When our food was being delivered, we asked the server for silverware and he accommodated that request. I had my heart set on dessert (thus, no appetizers!) but I realized I needed to save about half my steak and sides. Well, our waiter didn't check back with us for over 35 minutes AFTER I stopped eating. 35 minutes. He had walked by us numerous times but couldn't bother to be waved down. And the rest of the staff weren't curious? 35 minutes? He was apologetic but I call BS, even though I kept my game face on. I didn't want dessert by that point, I just wanted a box (otherwise I would have just paid on the Ziosk).",

Your expectations should be set along the same standards as any similar chain restaurant. Food was decent, service was ok.

Well that wasn't the case, it was Well Done, tough to chew and there was no seasoning..now for the Lobster tail, it was very small and the texture was very chewy and it tasted funky and terrible. I'm kicking myself for not complaining to the Manager but all I wanted to do was get out of there so I could go home and take a Compazine to settle my stomach. IF I ever go back here you can bet your life if there's ANYTHING off with my food the Manager will be made aware of this",

    "text": "It's a typical Friday night at Outback around 6pm and exactly what you expected PACKED.   However, we were able to get a table quickly and had a server named Heather.   From the time we sat down and throughout our meal Heather always had a smile on her face, continuously attentive to us and was always checking if we need anything else.  My fiance decided to order something we don't normally pick, the philly cheesesteak and unfortunately he was unhappy with it, but Heather said no problem, let's get you something you like and substituted it.  Shortly after, the Manager Michael came by and apologized for the inconvenience and said our meal would be out shortly.   Honestly, it wasn't his fault, we should've ordered what we enjoy.  Quickly thereafter, our meal came.   The Manager Michael and Heather came back on separate occasions and multiple times to check on us to make sure everything was ok, which we were all happy.   At one point, our daughter asked if we personally knew them and I explained to her, No, they're just really friendly and amazing here.     Working in a customer service setting, I know how extremely hard it is when it's busy and you are doing your best to make customers happy.  I saw Heather running around helping serve tables around us and she was always so friendly and smiling.   At the end of our meal, I told her thank you for being so friendly and her customer service was amazing.   She said \"I try my best to make you have a great dining experience so you can just sit and enjoy your food and not have to worry about anything else.\"  Well definitely mission accomplished.      On another note, I know customers love to call to complain and rarely call to praise. I feel this location definitely needs to be praise for all their hard work to go above and beyond to make their customers happy, regardless of a busy day or not.      Once again, I just wanted to say thank you to Michael and Heather for making our typical Friday night dinner extraordinary special.  We will definitely be back.",

One of the best parts of coming here is, the servers, their attentiveness, clean restaurant, and by far the best steaks for the price.

So we order our meal, I ordered chicken on the Barbie she brings me the Alice chicken, she tells me that the kitchen made it wrong so I checked the tabletop menu and she put the order in wrong.

So the manager comes over and says here is the chicken I know you told her you didn't want it, but I am not going to charge you for it.  Oh really wow why would you charge me if I didn't even get to eat. Our meal was ruined and you are willing to not charge me for chicken that I couldn't even enjoy. Horrible customer service.

My plate appeared a little empty and my steak looked like a kid's size steak; also, it could have been a little more cooked as I ordered it well-done. My boyfriend had a larger cut of meat and he regretted ordering it medium rare because it tasted under-cooked to him. He had a side of mashed potatoes and a salad which he liked. Bread to start our meal was good, though we could have used a bit more butter for it (they seem to be stingy about sauces and butter here).   We also ordered two appetizers. Crab-stuffed mushrooms which were pretty good, but a very small extra container of 'wild mushroom' sauce cost $3 - that seemed a little silly to us both. We're guests at their restaurant, so why not try to make us happy? The other appetizer was the onion sticks. Basically, glorified onion rings, and the onions were rather mushy.... the batter makes that appetizer - would never order it again, though.  Drinks were not brought out right away, so we had to sit there thirsty (it's 100 degrees outside today here in Vegas). Timely refills on drinks.  Desserts and special drinks looked nice, but we passed on them. The salt and pepper grinders are nice. Steakhouse 'feel' with much dark-wood paneling throughout the restaurant. Service fair to good. OK price, probably a good deal less expensive than expected, about $10 to $15 less. My boyfriend and I would return here sometime. Recommended.",

This is your companies reputation and I believe we deserve an answer for why we would be served a sirlion (which by the way, is a totally different price) and not the fillets, like we ordered? So, with no apologies or admittance from the manager we choose to leave. I'm disgusted at that whole ordeal. So for anyone reading this.... know your cuts of meat or they will try and pass off a cheaper meat but, charge you for the 30 dollar filet. She didn't even say it was a fillet either. The only reason is that they were serving sirlion trying to pass it off as fillets! So if someone just wants a steak and really doesn't know cuts of meat...then they got you! Shame on Outback Steakhouse. You are despicable and your choice in managers leaves me to question this companies integrity and character. I'll never go to any of them again and I will never recommend them to anyone either! Thank you for ruining our only night out! I guess I can't post this unless a star is given; so know that the star is only there to get this posted. They are very dishonest and that doesn't deserve a star! You can look on their menu or Google a sirlion or filet.",

The service she provided was second to none and made sure I never had an empty glass of lemonade :) when we got our food, my 8oz steak looked more like a 6oz steak, so I said my steak looked a bit smaller than 8oz, Terrance then brought out a second steak which was 6oz and the steaks were identical, so he just have me the 2nd 6oz steak at no extra charge. The food was cooked to perfection and I don't know of a time when I've had better service than tonight. Thank you Outback steakhouse for hiring such amazing staff like Alexis and Terrance.

I think the table near ours got our salads because I heard them tell their waiter that the dressings were wrong.  After the salads it was another 7 or 8 minutes until our food arrived. The food was good and cooked right. I have no complaints against the food. It was just the service. It was about 4:30 when we arrived, so not so much into the dinner rush for that to be the excuse.

Little one had the grilled cheese and fries (meh) and we ordered a couple of side Caesar salads. Service was attentive (even considering how slammed they were), manager was around and visible (even brought out food samples while we waited outside!).   Only reason for the missing star is we ordered a calamari app which was seriously over-salted (might have just been a kitchen error, but it made it inedible). Server took it away without any issues, manager followed up and offered a replacement app, but by this time, we were ready for dinner. We definitely appreciated the attentive service and manager follow-up and totally understood that this was just an oversight.   We will definitely be returning to this location, if only for that perfectly crispy chicken sandwich (dipped in buffalo sauce, served with a refreshing aioli....mmmm...) and that never-disappointing Caesar salad.",

So we hardly ever go anymore.   Decided to just have drinks and 2 appetizers.   No more expensive tough steak for us.   Well the blooming onion was greasy and not even cut thru.     We had to try and hack thru with knives to rip off the blooms.   That resulted in the batter in our hands and the onion still attached.    The quesadillas were awful .   Rubbery and tough.    Our bill was over 30 dollars.   We keep saying we aren't going back but we mean it this time !!!   Also prices have gone up at an astonishing amount.     Certainly not worth it.     Too bad. It used to be a nice place.                              Thank you for your response.   Email is <a href=\"mailto:nhardy2001@yahoo.com\">nhardy2001@yahoo.com</a>",

Our server Tanya R. was patient and gave us plenty of time after showing us where we could find the apps. We ordered the cheese fries which were sooo delish, the blooming petal which was tasty and the mac n cheese balls that looked, smelled and seemed wonderful but had a hint if sweetness I didn't care for. I mentioned this to our server and as she was apologizing the manager came by and apologized then promptly took away the funky tasting balls and said he would take it off for us. He was very nice and courteous and we ordered a piece of carrot cake that was soo moist and scrumptious. The manager definitely saved our visit. We liked that he fixed the problem promptly, came to check on us and then didn't bother us anymore. Sometimes managers have a tendency to overdo it. He was perfect. Not sure of his name but he had curly dark hair and was a thin little guy.",

She just lightened the mood, got our food out quicker, and was able to play along with our jokes. Pretty much all good vibes from her and really deserved a big tip.

The prime rib was cooked perfectly and paired great with the aus jus sauce.   Good and quick service too. We went on a Monday night around 6:30pm and the wait wasn't long. We waited for 5 mins before we got a table. Servers are friendly and gave us great service.   Will be back!",

The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare, and seasoned just right. You gotta get the onion blossom--we screwed up by getting a small portion and it was not enough for three.   I'll be back for sure to get that ribeye plus a large onion blossom.",

It was pretty busy but the wait wasn't too long. Our server, Ross, gave us all the time we needed to order and gave great recommendations.   Their blooming onion is a nice appetizer to have. I enjoyed the sauce that came with it, I thought the dish was just a bit more greasy than usual. Obviously the bread and butter is always good and we got our bread regularly replaced. I got the center cut Sirloin steak with baked potato and a salad. Everything was just perfect for me! The size portions were enough for me to not feel crazy bloated.   All in all, I have to come back again for their steaks. Great service, great foods, reasonable prices!",

There was plenty of parking outside, immediately was greeted and sat down. Ordered the Natural Bone-in Rib eye with a side of Macaroni. We also ordered small rack of baby back ribs but since I did not eat that I cannot really give opinions other than it looked great! lol Back to the steak! It was definitely a great portion 20 oz, the steak was very well seasoned, cooked just right, and was the perfect size for me. I didn't even need A1 sauce since the steak was so juicy! Service was great mate! Overall great steakhouse!",

    "text": "Outback: the Australia-themed steakhouse for all your meat-based needs. This chain's been around for a while, but it's only recently that I rediscovered this place after so long. The food here, I think, it always excellent, but service tends to vary based on the location.  I came here with my parents to treat them to dinner, and it already took up to 20 minutes before we were able to put in our orders. Even accounting for how busy the restaurant was, it was annoying that we kept getting missed by our server, and that she kept forgetting to bring our requests like hot water for our tea.  With Outback, there's really only one way to start -- with a Bloomin' Onion. We took advantage of a Bloomin' Monday deal and got one to share -- and we finished it completely out of hunger! We also got salad, their soups -- I got their French onion soup, which was amazing -- and their bread to pad out our meal. All of these were good and helped stave off the hunger while we waited for our entrees.  Outback is typically known for steak -- it's in their name, for crying out loud -- but I actually ordered their lamb this time around. Surprisingly, it was among the best lamb chops I'd eaten -- and my parents were in agreement with me on the taste! Their orders, the salmon and the prime rib, were also very good, but we all agreed that the lamb was by far the best of our choices that evening.  We ended with their Chocolate Thunder sundae, which was rich and decadent without being overly sweet. Overall, we enjoyed Outback and plan to come back again, but they should really work on their service. I would give them 3.5 stars out of 5 if I could -- they get a four since I was feeling generous and the food was good.",

The food was flavorful and I was impressed with their Pork Porterhouse (my new fave). I will definitely stop in more often",

According to The waitress, \"That's what we serve.\"   The piece of meat I got didn't taste like a Filet, though they said it was.  I took some for my dog.  Service was very slow even though there were only a few customers in the entire restaurant.  The new decor was nice, but that's the good thing I have to say about the place.  PS - the drink I ordered was hideous and tasted like salt and pepper.  I don't like to leave negative notes about a place, but this one needed it.",

Our server was pretty rude and he did not smile at all, not even once. I even tried to crack a joke but he didn't even laugh whatsoever. He was also a one word type of person and very monotoned. I just felt so annoyed the whole time I was there. Seems like he didn't care about the customers. I really wish we could've gotten a better server, because he definitely ruined my mood.  Oh! And when we were heading out, the hostess didn't even say bye or thank you to us. I had to be the one to say thank you to them and they didn't even acknowledge it -__-",

We ordered the fried calamari, filet mignon, NY strip steak & for dessert NY cheesecake. Our steaks were cooked perfectly. And I loved my baked sweet potato side & broccoli too. So fresh.   But the best part of it was the exceptional service we got from Moose. He gave us very personable & almost undivided attention, even in a busy restaurant (NFR was in town so place was super busy). Such great attitude & professionalism. I certainly hope he gets recognized for his service & that we have hun again as our server.",

Lots of fun and tasty appetizers (blooming onion and coconut shrimp) as well as yummy libations and desserts!   I'm from Texas so I'm a big fan of med rare juicy steaks. Sometimes, this Outback doesn't always have the most tender cuts which can kind of put a damper on the meal if you are going for steak. However, most of the times it's very tasty and all other menu items are good and great place for family dinners and even a nice night out.",

The first time we decided to sit down inside the restaurant of course it was very full but the wait times which they gave us were 25 to 35 minutes, But guess what it only took him 15 minutes to seat us. We will have to say the service there far exceeds any other Outback Steakhouse we have been to. The other time with their services for her to go order it back to our hotel this is why were giving five stars to this location the service there after to go order were very friendly making sure we had everything we can possibly need to make sure our meals were perfect. When we got back to our hotel we do not have to go looking for knives silverware extra napkins utensils any of that stuff. While we were there waiting for our food they were very accommodating allowing one of us to wait inside as our food was coming up. I will have to say if you're looking to grab a meal on the way home this location is number one to go to. If you're looking for a good chain steakhouse this will be the location you want to come to",

Server Jonny P. serve us a party of 4. We ordered the blooming onion to start off. App came shortly. We ordered drinks, had to return the mojito because the glass was dirty. He came back shortly with a new one. Flavor lacked in the mojito but was drinkable. Server was attentive and efficient. He had a bandaid on his finger which means that he is protecting my food from getting any of his bodily fluids on anything I consume. Overall I was pleased with the meal.",

Have seen they've remodeled the place inside and out, though mostly on the outside.   This time out, it took forever to try and get seated and even though they had 4 people working the front entrance to sit people down, they were non-communicative and non-attentive. You could tell they were young and not well versed in hospitality. Though we were a larger group of 7, and they were quite busy during dinner time, the wait was over 45 mins. While they told us 30-45 mins., I had to go to them for updates every 10 mins. as my elderly parents and young nieces were very hungry. And to top it all off, it was my brother-in-law's birthday and he chose Outback by name to celebrate his birthday. The front staff acted as if they could care less if we patronized--continued to patronize their establishment or not. As we saw many and all other customers get seated as the waiting area with the covered benches were empty, we and especially my bro-in-law grew sick of waiting though a table was finally almost available, we just left. It was his call, but I felt so bad for him since it was supposed to be his birthday dinner. The front staff made no effort to offer us to stay or even apologized for the long wait. Suffice it to say, they just lost some longtime customers from out of town.",

    "text": "This review is strictly for the female blond bartender. It took me a few days to get over what had happened. She tries to be sweet in your face by calling you \"Honey, Sweetie, etc\" but she is really in the wrong industry. She snaps and has an attitude without listening first. The bar was full the night we came in but seriously not our problem and when she makes mistakes and has to call for a manager she makes comments and tells her bar back to call the manager because \"she's not going to call the manager again\" (her words). I mean she is the one making a mistake and has the nerve to have an attitude about fixing it. We eat out often and we like to tip well- I did give her our regular tipping because I do understand that this is a livelihood and it was the holidays but her arrogance still bothers me. I don't want to go in full detail because it does get my blood boiling and don't want to re-live this night but I do have to mention one more thing- when you go for happy hour, their menu is not updated so when you ask for a drink and she has to fix it, she has attitude and instead of apologizing for not having accurate pricing or menus she tells me to \"remember for next time\". So if I come in 2 months from now I need to memorize their specials instead of going off their happy hour menu. Its the stupidest thing a bartender has ever told me. She should know her stuff but if not (we're all human) just fix it without making it seem like we're the dumb ones asking for the correct price. Thanks Outback for hiring an employee that makes us feel stupid for asking for the happy hour prices during happy hour. This was only a couple things that happened throughout the dinner. I have thought about complaining to corporate because it was such a bad experience. I just haven't decided if its worth it yet.",

If you put your name on the list for a shorter wait, that helps a lot. Just give them a call. The worst case scenario is that you will have to wait for your table surrounded by tourists who googled \"steak in Las Vegas\", realized that almost all the steak houses charge 10x for everything, and decided to lower their expectations for fanciness and take their craving on DOWN TO THE OUTBACK! I feel bad because you know they probably hailed a cab from their hotel thinking at this Outback was on the strip only to realize it is very much not. Oh well. Everyone needs to eat, including cab drivers.  To be honest, I would eat their unlimited shrimp off my lap while sitting outside of a Burger King if I had to. It's such a great deal.

We asked for the mild wings but for them to be fried hard and they followed the instructions to a T. We hate chewy chicken ugh so fried hard is important to us. Unfortunately, couldn't take a picture because my husband grabbed the bag and after a long shift, went straight to the chicken and devoured it. In fact, they gave him bleu cheese instead of ranch and well, he did not care.   Then we ordered 2 grilled shrimp on the barbie which my husband loved. It comes with some kinda salsa but the char taste is nice and they cook them just right.   I ordered the Aussie cobb salad with grilled chicken and oil and vinegar as my dressing. It was delicious. I really wish they would have followed my directions on no croutons but they didn't so I ate like 2 well probably 5 but I think I'll be okay haha. Also, just as preference, they do not put the chicken on the salad but rather in a container and it looks weird and oily but it's not. However, I'd prefer them to assemble my salad instead of me lol now I know what to ask for.   All in all, the food was cooked nicely, ordered was followed and it was delicious ...  Order again and they came through so well. If you want a great meal reasonably priced, this is the go to spot.",

    "text": "My other half and I decided to keep our Valentines Day plans a little more casual and just get a nice steak from this Outback.  We've visited here before, and thought the steaks are comparable to nicer establishments. So we assumed this visit would be equally as nice.  However, this particular visit did not meet my expectations in the least.   Our visit started with an overcrowded front hostess stand, with several employees hovering over one lady that seemed overwhelmed.   Then, we choose to sit at the bar, seeing as how there's a hefty (and expected) wait time for a table.   The bartender greeted us and gave us menus. It took quite a while until having her come back for our orders. She was too preoccupied with breaking down parts of the bar, as if to get ready to leave.   The worst part was whatever towel that was being used to wipe down had an incredibly foul odor! It smelled like that smell when you leave wet clothes in the washer for too long.  It completely ruined my dining experience as it was all I could smell while trying to eat.   I didn't want to mention it to the lady, since she never smiled throughout our experience and already seemed like the guests were a disruption.   As far as the food goes, I had zero complaints. It was very flavorful and tasty!!",

Jeff came by to cover if she was picking up food & Terrence, the manager, in an apron came by to make sure all was good.  Thank you Chef.  I have to say the BEST Outback is right here & I am not a chain restaurant person.  Here is like a neighborhood restaurant.  They refill water, tea & bring all condiments without the usual request.  Only off of what you order.    Food always consistent.  I order the Steakhouse Salad, medium every time & my dad orders the Prime Rib rare.  Always perfect!  Thank you staff.  I do hope you get recognition cause it's not usual to find this service, especially in a chain.  And I have been here three times in two months.  2.24.19 Server Michael & two Manager's Dennis & another checked in on us, were awesome & very helpful!  Food was delicious... 2 Rib-eye's loaded baked potato, broccoli w/ cheese, Sirloin, baked potato, Tangy Tomato Salad & Grilled Salmon w/ tasty blistered green beans.  Consistently excellent service & food as a local.  Keep up the good work.",

    "text": "We have always had Outback on LV Blvd as one of our favorite steakhouse, since it's close to our house, and especially since they have really good food. Since we hadn't been there in a year, we decided to go to dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We were there on a Sunday night and were seated immediately. We were surprised that there was no line .. we were approached by our waiter, unfortunately I do not remember his name. He brought the bread then took our beverage orders and I noticed on the table that there was an advertisement about a free bloomin Onion if you checked in on Yelp. So upon his return we showed him the check in on Yelp so he put in our order for the bloomin Onion and came back and took our dinner main course orders.  The blooming onion came out rather quickly and was delicious. Keep in mind it was not brought out to us by our waiter.  At this point, we still did not have our cutlery. We literally used our fingers to eat the onions. Our waiter comes by and he asked how the appetizer was. We said it was delicious and asked for more dipping sauce. He said he would go and get us more and walked away rather quickly. A few minutes later, he was at another table taking their order while we were waiting for our sauce and still have not been given cutlery. We flag him down to get his attention and we ask for the cutlery and he agreed to bring some with the sauce.  We actually waited an hour before we received our main course... That was simply unacceptable, especially since the restaurant was not busy. I have been here when it was busy... Meaning there were people outside waiting for tables. There were no people waiting last night...  The reasons for the 2 stars: -Why should we be asking for cutlery? Isn't that something that should already be waiting for customers on the table?  -What happened to \"anticipating what your customers need\"?  -our waiter kept forgetting our requests -he took my stepsons drink cup to refill it and never brought it back until we asked for it back -we asked for lemons with our drinks and he didn't bring them out until we asked  The quality of the food is really high however the service has gone the opposite way and unfortunately,  that affects our decision on going back..",

I got the cobb salad and my hubby got ribs, veggies and a salad.  The food was all pretty good.  But what got me was the service.  We didn't know the loaded mashed potatoes came with a huge blob of sour cream, not the sour cream mixed in.  Our server brought us another with no sour cream right away.  He kept our drinks filled, and was all around very attentive.  Overall it was a great experience and I'm sure we will be back on another trip to Vegas.",

I love the cherry tomatoes with balsamic vinaigrette lightly coated.  It's also served with a couple of grilled sourdough bread slices. It was perfect!  My husband got the 6oz filet and lobster tail. Of course it's the size you would get from Red lobster but he said the steak was cooked perfectly MR and tender.  No pics of our food because I devoured it before we could take some.   The only thing that could have been better was our server. He initially took our order and dropped our drinks off and we never saw him again. We used the table kiosk to pay when we were done and my husband drink the rest of soda so he could finish his meal. Then we left!",

The wait was very pleasant for a wait and we only ended up waiting 15 minutes or so. Once we were seated, our server came by almost immediately with fresh bread. She took our drink and appetizer order and had both out almost instantaneously. Everything was piping hot, flavorful, and delicious. Our server was so sweet and checked in at least every fifteen minutes. The manager, Michael, checked in too and made sure we were happy. Overall, we were very impressed with our meal and definitely found a new favorite restaurant. The only downside is it is a bit pricey.",

    "text": "A few years ago, I came to outback almost every week.  Their food was amazing and I love their complimentary bread that they give.  But then they started to go down-hill.   The food was cutting it anymore and the service wasn't as great as I remembered it to be.  So, I stopped going to outback for about three years.  BUT now, wow they changed their menu and added/removed a few items as well.  I was impressed!  They no longer have my favorite sinful sydney sundae, but they added milkshakes. Oh man was that AMAZING. I ordered the cappuccino milkshake, it is my new favorite dessert! It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't too powerful with the cappuccino.  It was just perfect. I am craving it as I am typing this review.  The entree was good, I ordered the half-order of baby back ribs.  It was tender and juicy.  I did not like the fries that much, but I was already full from the two complimentary breads that I ate and an appetizer.   Appetizer, we ordered the steak nachos thing, it was interesting. The nachos or \"chips\" was really good, but I feel like they didn't add enough steak on it.    Service - he was a great and friendly server.  He seemed busy, but he kept all of us content and no complaints at all.    I think I am in love with outback again!",

    "text": "I've been to this location on several occasions in the past, but I was here most recently today for lunch.   My coworker was raving about the blue cheese wedge for days and she convinced me I need to try it. Well, I didn't order the wedge, but I did try the blue cheese chopped salad instead. I don't know why I'm so averse to chopping up my own wedge, hah. I have to admit the salad was great. The blue cheese was tangier than most, which I love. Nothing better than blue cheese.   My salad came with a half sandwich. I chose the prime rib dip, but I was a little disappointed that it was served on a focaccia bread instead of french bread. The meat was pretty good, but I just wasn't a fan of the bread and decided to eat around it. My coworker was just as thrilled about her wedge as before. A winner in her book again.  The service was fast and friendly and definitely a great place for a quick bite when you're limited on time. The meals were very reasonably priced as well. The lunch specials come with a soft drink and are incredibly filling for the price.",

We kind of came towards the end of the night and I felt really bad because my husband is a server and I know how he feels when people come at the last minute. However Sydney took very good care of us and didn't make us feel like we were rushed. She even encouraged us to get some dessert at 10 when they were supposed to be closed. So thank you Sydney!   In regards to the food, we ordered the sampler appetizer and it was alright. We always can't decide between the cheese fries and the blooming onions so it was nice to have a sample of both along with the Mac and cheese. For our entree we decided to share the ribeye and grilled shrimp with a side of baked potato and house salad. The grilled shrimp was my least favorite because It was salty. The ribeye was decent and flavored well. The baked potato wasn't anything too fancy and it had all the works on it. The salad was bigger than I remembered and I got full off of that. The mustard dressing was good and I liked that they don't drench the salad. This place is great if you're wanting steak and too lazy to cook it for yourself.",

We went on a random Wednesday and apparently they have a 3-course meal deal on Wednesdays.    First your selection of soup and salad (I could swear on the menu it says soup OR salad  but our server insisted it was both)   We had a caesar salad and a tortilla soup.  The soup had a nice kick to it.   Other appetizers we tried were the crab stuffed mushrooms (4 pieces- not bad) and the short rib nachos (didn't finish it)  For the main entree, a nice juicy steak.  Seasoned well, cooked medium (just enough pink).  Nothing could be found wrong with this piece of meat.. Mmmm..   We opted for a chocolate cheesecake for dessert.  The other option was blueberry.    Server was pretty attentive.  All-in-all a good experience.",

Server Anthony, took the drink orders right away but that was the only thing he seemed to pay attention to. After that, he brought it and asked if we wanted bread, we said yes and I ordered the appetizer of the Onion Petals. After this point a table behind us which was seated 7 minutes after us being there and the server brought out the OTHER table their drinks, their bread, talked with them real politely and then about 10 minutes later, FINALLY we got our bread. When he brought the bread he set it down, and walked away. About 15 minutes later he brought our Blooming Petals, said he would get the refills on our drinks later and then take our order, went back to the OTHER TABLE, asked them for their order, took it, and looked back at our table, came and only then took our order but as an afterthought. When the food came out, mind you my other half and I got the SAME THING, but his order was wrong. At the time, I asked for a to go cup for my soup which NEVER CAME. But the OTHER TABLE got the sauce they ask for almost immediately. Now, my other half was already irritated at our horrible server and cancelled his order. Then they asked 3 more times if he was sure he didn't want his original order, and he said no 3 MORE TIMES. By now, I was done eating seeing my other half irritated at this, and had to ask A DIFFERENT SERVER for yet another to go container for my food. During the time we were paying and everything, our initial server walked by 4 or 5 more times, never said a word to us, and practically ignored us the entire night. Probably the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. Not to mention, the fact that my other half always leaves good tips for our servers, and tonight it wasn't worthy of the dime we decided to leave. Tonight was the WORST WAY to celebrate our anniversary and our upcoming wedding. If you plan to have any sort of good night, you're better off going down the block to Buffalo Wild Wings. WE WILL NEVER BE BACK!",

I will also say that I don't blame our server for the slow service we received, I think it was management's lack of having the store being properly staffed for the day. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides and salad were good. So on those merits I will give three stars. But the speed of things left a lot to be desired.   We were seated immediately, but didn't get greeted or have our drink orders taken for 15 minutes. The waiter kept trying to make it to our table to get our order but kept getting short-stopped by impatient people at other tables. He obviously was getting overwhelmed. After our drinks finally arrived 15 minutes later he took our order. Then finally after an hour after being seated we got our entrees.   I should have taken the hint when the waiter did that thing where they just throw the check on your table without asking if you want desert, but we ordered desert anyway, which turned into a half hour ordeal after first placing the order. Then my daughter received the  wrong item and we had wait another 15 minutes for them to fix it. So almost two hours after being seated we finally left.  Luckily I had really good company, and overall had a great tasting meal. It is just that it was at the speed of some french restaurant where you get the table for the entire night.",

I've been to enough Outbacks to know that they are not all the same. This is the best one I've ever been to.   My son and I went to the Palm last week and had a $50 steak & lobster meal and the next day we had a similar meal at the Outback for $15. The steak was almost as good and the lobster tail was actually better!   There is a delicious chop steak that is not on the menu, but available if you ask. It comes with mushrooms and a wine sauce and mashed potatoes. I prefer it plain with a baked potato.  I'd highly recommend this Outback to anyone wanting a good meal at a very fair price!",

    "text": "This is by far the best Outback that we have been to.  My husband and I are not typically fans of Outback Steakhouses and find that the wait is not usually worth the food, but this location proved us wrong!  We have been here three times so far and the only downfall we have seen was the fact that others know how wonderful it is too!  There are always lines of people waiting inside and out of this location and so we would recommend calling ahead and making a reservation if you are going in as a group...or at least plan on waiting.  Each time we feel as if we should go somewhere else, but the times that we did decide to stay we did not regret.  It really is worth the wait.  Our servers have always been very friendly, our orders have always came out quickly and prepared as ordered, and everything that we have ordered so far has been mouthwatering delicious.  We WILL be going back :)",

We finally got around to having a family party to ring in my 31st year and I decided on Outback because I was craving some cheese fries.   We were seated within 5 min and greeted by Gavin who was delightful and knew all about Ratatouille (I try to bring the kids portable DVD players to restaurants so they don't terrorize the other guests. Best money I have ever spent.). Of course we ordered cheese fries, steaks, salads, the kids usual mac and cheese and the Wallaby Darned cocktail. The cheese fries and the Outback Special sirloin were the highlights. I loved the lobster and mushroom topping you can add on. The steaks were cooked perfectly (med-rare is the only way to have a steak in my never-too-humble opinion). Everyone in my family was happy and we will be back soon. Make sure you go earlier because the wait can top over an hour or sit at the bar.",

Being a worldwide traveling \"foodie\", it is rare for an owner of a \"chain\" restaurant to treat his customers like they were his personal guests. This owner appears to, as does his staff. My steak and lobster were created just to my specifications and my waiter was attentive without being a nuisance.  Also, it is a known local place on the strip but not \"on the strip\" that has a genuine reputation for local Vegas celebrity sightings. I saw a few, who also appeared to be enjoying themselves.   Cheers! Highly recommended.",

Its unpretentiousness, inexpensiveness, and tastiness are what keep us coming back for more salads and filet mignon.    Just a little note, the Queensland Salad comes with chicken salad on top of the salad.  You are able to substitute this with their wonderfully seasoned grilled chicken breast.  Not only are the salads fresh and delicious alone but the dressings...oh the dressings... All of their salad dressings are made fresh everyday!  My favorites being the 1000 Island and Ranch (for dipping the Aussie Fries into).  The steaks are comparable to some of the Strip's top steakhouse restaurants, for a fraction of the price.  PERIOD.  Never had any room left over for dessert, so that's a strike for me.    Service is good to great at this location.",

Hence the reason I am jotting these thoughts down as guests from LA wanted something quick, and affordable off (but still near) the Strip.  You can always count on great comfort food here, and the service is equally good...quick and responsive.    The quality is not comparable to say, Hanks or Morton's, but they have a full service bar and plenty of offerings that will make the most picky eater happy with their choice.  Caution! Their are trained to \"up sell\" everything, so be prepared to order items you cannot finish...kudos to their training program!",

He NEVER once asked how our meal was or even checked back. Towards the end he said if we needed desert we could order it through the Ipad on the table and even pay the bill. Absolutely NO customer interaction resulting in a very bad experience. If I bring back my wife and 5 kids we definitely will make a point to NOT sit anywhere around this server.

    "text": "It was late arriving to Las Vegas and we were hungry and the closest steakhouse to our location was a place called outback.  We made our way there on foot and went up a stairwell to the restaurant which seems like a rather obscure location  The place was definitely not clean and had a funky smell.  We were seated in a booth in the back.  I said what's the best steak you have and please instruct the chef to prepare it with a garlic infusion with a medium rare temperature.  The chef came out with the largest porterhouse steak I may have ever seen and he himself said it on the table along with a ribeye and a fillet mignon for my guests.  This quite possibly without any second thought could pass as or could be the best steak I ever had in my life.   I was truly shocked that out of this crappy Las Vegas strip dirt hole of a restaurant could come such an amazing steak prepared by an awesome chef!  Just ask for the best steak in the house prepared with a garlic infusion...   Give it a shot you can't lose and to top it all off the steak was so cheap I couldn't believe it.  Five stars goes out to the chef",

Next I ordered a filet and then received a sirloin strip. The server, not original waiter, even identified it as a sirloin steak. I requested the filet I'd ordered but was then schooled on what a filet really is. Frustrated and aggravated, I received my bill. Once the 25$ gift card was applied I still owed 25$ for my partners shrimp and tea meal. No alcohol beverages were ordered. Outrageous and truly insulting. If you want others to choose your meal choices for you and you like condescending conversation by your servers then this is the place for you.",

I recommend this location for a quick lunch, meal with your family/friends or just to have your favorite drink. They are busy so remember to make reservations during holidays or peak hours. Asst Mgr / Bartender Anthony also good. Michael the manager is helpful, caring and nice as well!",

The new ordering system of me having to order an appetizer or desert through a touch screen! Give me a break you are a full service restaurant charging more than a lot of others. This isn't McDonalds but now is to me.   Outback you really need to rethink this! I also was told by my waiter tonight that a lot of people had quit over it, but he is happy as he is getting a bunch of hours.

    "text": "It was memorial day weekend and I was craving meat... Go figure! Lol I guess I didn't have enough ribs on Sunday....  Anyhow, I was craving a nice juicy steak but I didn't want to shell out $$$$$ on a steak on the strip somewhere. I wanted a steak that wasn't going to break the bank and Outback came to mind... And it had been years since I've been to one but my vague old memories were of steaks that were decent for a decent price. So here I went! :)  We got seated after waiting for about 15 minutes which was cool since they had actually quoted us a 20 minute wait. We got a cozy 2 person booth by the entrance to the kitchen so occasionally all we could hear was \"corner\" being yelled out by the staff as they were walking around the corner... But it wasn't too bad.  Ambiance decent...4/5  The BF was starving and so we got a sampler. It came with Mac n cheese balls, Aussie fries and bloomin onion petals. The portion size was decent for the price. The mac n cheese was very very cheesy which in my book always equal DELICIOUS! :D~ The Aussie fries had a good account of cheese and bacon bits on it... The bf scarfed it down... And the bloomin onion petals were so crunchy and battered perfectly. All of them could have been really greasy but they weren't. We pretty much cleared the plate. We had to wait a bit for our food but the server came and let us know that the food would be out shortly. Our server was actually really great. She touched our table a few times to refill our drinks and to see how we were doing.  When our food finally came out... My ribeye was way overcooked. I requested medium and the steak came out well-done. Eeeewwwww! I pointed it out and they whisked it away and left me my steamed broccoli and baked sweet potato to eat while they recooked my steak. I was just expecting my steak back but no they brought me a whole new plate! Which in my book was a very nice touch. The manager came by and talked to us twice just to make sure that we were happy. And honestly, I was not all that annoyed that my steak was overcooked since my bf's steak was perfect and he was the one that was starving. Lol They salvaged a below par experience and totally made it a great night by exceeding my expectations. And the steak was cooked to perfection. It was medium leaning towards the med rare side which is how I like it. Ribeye was tender with a good amount of fat running through it and the seasoning on it was perfect. The sweet potato was baked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed to oh dare I say it again... Yup it was steamed to perfection. Still a bright green with a small bite so that it wasn't total mush.  Flavor 5/5  Yes my experience could have been totally ruined but they cared enough to make sure that my ribeye was cooked to my standards.  Will I return... Yup! I will. :) Does it compare to the dry aged ribeye at CarneVino? No it didn't but then again it also didn't break the bank. For the price, Outback is totally worth it. When I'm craving steak... I'll be back! :)",

    "text": "I've found myself at this Outback twice now for lunch during the work week. I was leery both times since I'm a steak fanatic and typically favor local restaurants. For a chain steakhouse this place is pretty decent.   This location is near many businesses so they are great at accommodating a lunch hour. Seating was prompt and the waitress was quick to get orders taken. The food is pretty quick and check out is efficient with no problem in getting split checks.   I'm currently counting calories so I studied the menu well the day before eating here. Outback posts their nutrition facts on their website for those that are interested. I found out that Victoria's 6 ounce filet with mixed vegetables and asparagus would fell within the calorie range I had allotted for lunch. The only downside is that the filet isn't an item on the lunch menu so my meal was more expensive than what I would normally spend for a quick weekday lunch. I didn't see anything on the lunch menu that I recognized as a low calorie option from the website.   The Victoria's filet was pretty tasty and it was prepared as requested. The seasoning was pretty good, but probably high in sodium. The veggie sides were very good for vegetables. The size of the meal was satisfying without being a heavy meal. My coworker ordered Ahi Tuna as an appetizer and insisted that I try it. I thought the pepper crust was nice, but I'm not sure I would order it for myself. He also ordered the steak tacos which were chock-full of steak and looked delicious. The steaks are a good lunch value from the lunch menu.",

Shrimp on the Barbie reminded me of some Italian anti pasta but they were ok. Nice salad, warm bread, shrooms and veggies were cooked to perfection. Crispy veggies but not raw. Baked potato soup was good. A little cool but not cold. Topped off with Shiraz which made it a perfect meal. Compliments to the chef. We were at the bar and the service was outstanding. Great job!!   Had steaks twice this trip to LV and the quality of beef seems to have lessened. Tougher and less taste. Service was good. No lettuce or salads. And no Shiraz. An Aussie wine that is served at most outbacks. And no Dos XX beer.",

I enjoyed the Grilled salmon 10oz as my entree, with a plain baked potato on the side. They also have a 7oz portion option, but beware, the ounces listed on the menu is the weight of the fish UNcooked... hence the reason I got the 10 oz.   The Australian theme always makes me giggle - you can't really call any of the menu \"authentic\" Australian anything other than the clever marketing.  Where's the grilled kangaroo?!? LOL   Prices are reasonable, selection is pretty good and they have a lot of different healthy fish options on the entree menu.",

We've come here at all times of day, but the evening is always a bit rough. The only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because sometimes the service and food is a bit inconsistent. For example, the broccoli sometimes is very dry or the sweet potatoes are really hard, or maybe the soup is a little watery. Other times, you might have to flag down the waiter or they might be too slow to come and greet us, but like I said, we came here so often and the good outweighs the bad.  I typically get the baked potato soup without bacon. It's one of my favorite dishes, and the broccoli here is amazing. If you're a vegetarian/vegan, do not get the broccoli!! We were informed that the butter used contains chicken brother. Just an FYI.   The last time we came, which was yesterday, our server was Trent. Trent was very patient and friendly. He came back to give us bread several times, and didn't seem bothered at our modifications for food. He's very nice and wouldn't mind having him again. There was a moment where he was coughing and excused himself, and came back a few seconds later, which we all laughed about together. Great experience!",

Well, our appetizer wasn't put in, barely got refills on our drinks. I changed my side dish (with the waiter) it never happened. He never even returned with the check, but he sure showed up quick when we had cash on the table.   **Note to servers, if I have to put my order in myself, whether It be for food, drink or appetizers your tip will be effective!!",

    "text": "FYI -- I used to go to Outback. I always got the 6 oz steak and it is always tough, no matter how raw the meat is. I always complain about it to the staff and management. They say it has to do with the cut and the grain of the meat. I personally think it is probably because the meat is always frozen (maybe freeze burns on the meat). I am not sure why every time I get the 6oz cute steak, it is always tough and not enjoyable to eat. Their soups are too thick and very salty too, which I don't like at al. The only thing that I really like at Outback is their full blooming onions, not the petals ones. The petal ones are over fried and very greasy. I have stop going to Outback on Las Vegas Blvd, near Outlet Mall South, after going there prior for almost 5 years.",

We had the sampler appetizer which was good, cheese fries, fried Mac and cheese balls and onion rings. The normally they serve it with small pieces of bacon on the cheese fries, although it's not mentioned on the menu, I don't eat pork so they replaced the cheese fries minus bacon.  My wife ordered steak served well done which was dry, expectedly, and salty. I ordered the philly steak sandwich which was just ok.   The restrooms were nasty, My wife refused to use it, vomit in one stall and sh!t all over the other toilet and on the floor. The Men's restroom floor had urine on the floor, the paper towel dispenser was not working and the other dispenser was out of paper. So all the guys were air drying their hands. Tons guys walking out without washing, I had to wait for someone to open the door to slip out without touching the handle. We most likely won't be going back here.",

    "text": "A consistent and dependable quality family-friendly steakhouse in a pleasant casual environment. The recent remodel is very nice and the addition of comfortable patio furniture outside for those times when you have to wait for a table is appreciated. Not sure if you can bring a drink from the bar outside, but it's a pleasant enough area regardless. We like to go for the Wednesday 3-Course Menu special that seems to be a regular promotion now. There are also three different price points offering at least different menu items each, including soup or salad, a side, and a dessert. I always order the French Onion soup. It is always piping hot and a rather generous serving considering it's part of the meal. I believe it's $1 extra, but so worth it. Just the right amount of cheese on top, that you get a bite with every spoonful. Recently we also noticed the portions of sides seemed to have gotten larger. I'm not complaining. Finally, the carrot cake is the best, but we end taking it home to enjoy later after filling ourselves on the main course. Here's a tip I almost hesitate to share: if you go around 9:00P.M. after the mall closes, it's a much quieter and quicker dining room.",

Update: table next to us also complained about plates with food residue....see it's not just me.

I forgot what it was called but it had some special sauce on it and that along with the A1 made it just perfect.  Also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and bread they served.  Of course with most steaks, the prices are a little spendy, but actually with some of the specials you can order a pretty good sized meal for around $10-$15 which is what I did.  Good food, clean dining room, good service, not much to complain about.  I would come back here again.",
