Mom picked up a Nacho Tavern Double and margarita.   The food definitely met RR standards yet again, as it was incredibly delicious. This location gets the food down. It's the service I was worried about. Fortunately Anna was a dream come True. There are two Annas but our Anna had long black hair and the cutest glasses. Was very attentive, explained things and didn't make us feel like we were bothering her. Vastly superior service against our last visit.  5 stars for Anna because if there's a Red Robin that makes less than superb food, it needs to go out of business.",

Staffing: Nothing short of maximum effort on their part.  Visibly  sweating, moving nonstop, amazingly positive attitude for the unending river of shit customers were giving them.  Food: Not too shabby.  On par with other Red Robins we have been to.   What happened today was more than likely a perfect storm.  Holiday weekend, 12:30 lunch rush, and no kidding at least 8 groups of families with showed up in a 5 minutes span to be seated.   Loud, baby strollers everywhere, parents obviously fried from dragging their screaming kids from store to store all morning; this was a tough day for the staff.   So  Food: 3.5 stars.  It's burgers and fries.  Atmosphere: 0 stars due to the noise, chaos, ( but a solid 4 for the actual place; surprisingly clean) Staff: 10 stars.  I would have quit on the spot. Strong work gang.

    "text": "The food was good but the service was very poor and odd at times.  This was our first visit to Red Robin.  Since we live less than a 1/2 mile away, this was a chance to try one of the newer food places in Downtown Summerlin.  You never get a second chance to make a first impression.   We were semi-greeted when we walked in when an employee reached below the podium and got two sets of menus and finally gestured us to follow him.  I don't recall him saying a word to us.  Our server came to the table promptly and seeing his name tag, I said good afternoon *name*.  He responded with, \"Hi, I'm *name* and I'm going to be your server.  He was trained to introduce himself and give his name and by damn he was going to do it even though I had already spoken to him by name.  Odd.  He took our drink orders and soon brought two iced teas to the table.  We asked for time to study the menu more and when he came back we were ready to order.  He had also given me a card to text a word to a number to join Red Robin's reward program.  (He has seen me using my iPhone as I was checking into Yelp).  My wife ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  She got a cup of Red's Chili Chili and a BLTA croissant.  I ordered a cup of chicken tortilla soup and a Burnin' Love burger.  *name* asked me if I wanted my soup with my burger or before.  I answered before.  After not too long, I was surprised when two dinners were brought and I had received no soup.  Oh well, to err is human and I forget a lot, too.  No big deal.  My wife enjoyed her sandwich and really liked the chili.  My burger was topped with a grilled jalapeno that was very good and was a hot one.  There were \"jalapeno coins\" and the burger was on a jalapeno kaiser roll.  There was also chipotle aioli on the burger.  With all this talk about peppers and burnin' love, the only spicy thing was the actual grilled jalapeno.  The burger was good and I liked the fries.  Since they were bottomless steak fries, I wanted to get some more and to get an iced tea refill.  *name* never came back to see how things were.  I finally flagged him down and asked for more fries and iced tea.  Since there were people at three other tables, *name* could be forgiven for being overwhelmed with the work.  I finished my burger before my extra fries were brought and I had moved my plate to the center of the table to make room for the fries.  When they were brought, *name* removed the two plates from the center taking with him my fork I was going to use with my fries.  Instead, I used one of our large toothpicks to eat some fries until they cooled enough to pick up with my fingers and eat.  Before we were finished with our meal, *name* stopped by to see if we wanted to dessert.  I said back off in a nice manner.  When finished, *name* came back and we ordered the mountain high mudd pie.  The dessert was quite good but once again *name* had a way of irritating me.  *name* brought our check while we were enjoying dessert and rather than just folding the two sides closed and leaving it on the side of the table with the no hurry message, *name* insisted on leaving the check holder unfolded and almost forced it under my right elbow as I was eating dessert.  I picked it up, slapped the two sides together, and put it to my left out of the way.  Before we were finished, *name* came back to pick up the check.  I waved him off.  When we were finished, I looked at the check and sure enough, charged for soup I didn't get.  I pointed this out to *name* and told him he never brought the soup.  He just stared at the check and then walked away never saying sorry I forgot or anything else.  He brought the check back and he once again insisted on pushing the opened check holder under my right elbow.  *name* just doesn't learn.  I paid the check and we left.  My rating for Red Robin would have been a three.  The food is not bad and I enjoyed it.  Service is what brought it down.  *name* needs some retraining.  You've been open long enough to have this correct.  One thing, they won't have to worry about a free burger on my birthday.  I won't be redeeming that reward.  A second chance to make a first impression--of course not!  A second chance at having decent service along with decent food--maybe!",

If this were my business, I would make it clear to my employees that cellphones should remain in your locker, and if you are caught texting while working you will get a warning and will be subsequently fired for the 2nd offense.  Very mediocre burger, crappy side salad. Expensive beer ($6) for domestic.  So much potential, ruined by bad management.

The restaurant clearly had dirty empty tables and the wait time was 15 minutes. Due to my boyfriend who absolutely loves burgers, I decided to stay.   I notified them that I would come back and still I came back to waiting 45 minutes before I could even place an order. On the brighter note, they allowed me to try sauces before I could order. The attitude from the one of the waitresses because of their new system at the end was uncalled for. I had issues with the payment and didn't want to leave without making sure the transaction was successful. Unless you have time to spare or are attempting to leave with free food, this is the location. For once the hostess was useful (in taking my money) by checking the system.   Food: the food was decent and is pretty worth it regarding bottomless fries. Highly recommended the seasonings and to ask for their different sauces before settling on the average ranch or ketchup. The shakes are well-worth the price and are pretty reasonable; which you can order a monster size for a dollar extra. The mud pie at the end was HUGE!   P.S. Was not charged for the sodas (don't know if they took it out of the bill, or forgot.)",

Mindy was the manager floating and assisting her servers with the not-so-busy climate in the restaurant being 5pm and not reaching peak dinner time. She kept ensuring her customers were well fed, and always stocked with whatever they needed. I'm an observant guy so when I see a manager on the floor and being extra enthusiastic with her customers, it just shows that she's serious about customer service. She didn't mind taking food plates from customers, bringing sauces, and even bussing tables. She wasn't a high horse about her position like most managers I see in a food and beverage facility. Mindy assisted us well, and our table neighbors in a very polite manner. 5 stars!  Harrison was our server. Nothing but positive from this guy. Enthusiastic, brought our food to us in a timely manner, AND respectful of any requests we had. I'm not sure what he told the guys in the back but they brought us a mountain high mud pie for no reason and he acted like he had nothing to do with it, it was on the house. 5 stars for him as well!  Thanks Red Robin! We'll be back!",

As our waiter Tyler was obviously in way over his head.  Our drink order was taken and we asked to order our food right then because we knew he would not be back. The manager isn't coming anywhere near our section as nobody gets refills, nobody can pay their check since the devices were broken. The table sat after us were already done with their meal and were still sitting there. The food came at 720 and I'm like all the sides should have been fries these orders are wrong and the server who brought our food just said oh. So I get up to go hunt down the manager I tell the manager all that has gone on and he says well what do you want me to do about it. And I go well I'm telling you we're leaving we aren't eating this food and we will never be back. We normally never complain we just don't return, but this was ridiculous. He's the manager he knows he has a server that can't handle it never goes in his section, never checks, doesn't help him. I get he wanted him to fail probably to fire him but we were the ones who suffered. I have never had to walk out of a restaurant before. It's not hard to tell a table I'm sorry let me help my server and correct your orders. Do not go here for any reason ever.",

We ordered some drinks first, I got the Skinny Lime Margherita, it wasn't that good in fact they put way to much lime in it to the point my face kept puckering with every sip. The server offered to put more agave in it but I knew that wouldn't fix it, that would just turn it into limeade. I bought a shot for my drink, and that seemed to do the trick. I do appreciate the fact that my server tried to fix my drink though   We got out food, I got the Shroom Burger, which was tasty.

Came with a group of 7, neither hostess seemed like they  knew how to seat a group that big and it took a long time to just get seated, when all they had to do was push 2 tables together in their EMPTY dining room. Off to a great start already. We all order and wait for what seems like forever, only to receive our orders, with tons of errors. One of our friends burgers was missing a couple things he asked for. We didn't get the poutine that we ordered when we received all our other food. When we informed them, they brought it out with mushrooms,  which we asked to not have on it. I just felt like saying forget it at this point and just get up and walk out. The poutine was absolutely horrible. The \"cheese curds\" were completely dry in the middle. I am a WI girl, so don't try giving me mediocre curds!  The only thing every employee seemed to be good at was asking if we needed more fries every time they passed by, even though we clearly had two full baskets that they brought us before that we didn't touch. No, we don't need more freaking fries! So annoying.  The whole almost 3 hours we where here, dealing with horrible service, the servers and manager were acting like we were being annoying and weren't welcome when they were the ones messing everything up. Sorry, but this was not our fault Red Robin. They offered two free desserts between the 7 of us, which even came out wrong! They then proceeded to take forever to settle the bill. I shouldn't have to sit in a restaurant for that long getting horrible service and being treated like we aren't wanted. We will not be returning to this location, ever. So disappointed.",

After being ignored by four, yes four employees who walked by, including our server, our server returned. He stated without asking what we wanted \"your food is being prepared now\". I said no we are leaving. Place half empty, being ignored by four staff, and only after the light being on 10 minutes being told our food is being \"prepared now\", Eek! Methinksnot. We did tell the hostess on the way out we never got our food, she said \"what you have been here a long time\". She did offer to get the manager for us, no thanks. We did not want a free meal, we just wanted to be acknowledge and not have four of your staff just walk by. Go to Five Brothers, just as good and better fries. Oh yeah, better service too.",

We got the poutine for an appetizer and the fries were cold even the table next to us sent their fries back bc they were cold. We kept quiet though. When our meals came the food just didn't look \"great\", it wasn't like it was the first month they opened when we first ate here, (it was so damn good that time). Our meals arrived our fries were cold and dry. So we finally said something to our server. (We know it's not her fault our food was cold). Either one of us finished our burgers they were nothing special the bun was dry like it was old and burger lacked any kind of flavor. 5 guys burgers are way better. The reason I'm writing this review is bc Red Robin was the only thing I ate today and now I'm doubled over with stomach pain and feel so sick. Something is clearly going wrong in the kitchen and the management should take these reviews seriously bc I'm not the first to complain about feeling sick after dining with your restaurant.  Sincerely,  A concerned guest.",

My wife and I were seated at the high tables but the chairs were wobbly. I tried moving over a couple of chairs from another table but they were wobbly too.  I would have preferred a booth but it was never offered which is surprising since the place was half empty.  I ordered a water with my meal but couldn't drink it because it tasted awful. Even the lemon (which I didn't ask for nor did I want) couldn't help the taste. The fries were barely warm and obviously had sat for a while. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the burger tasted good. That was my first and last time at that Red Robin.",

In a nutshell, the service that probably starts with the management really is that bad. We have been moved from one table to another because of a shift change? We always have to waive a server down (even when it's not ours) to get refills on fries and drinks on all occasions! Our last server even said the dreaded \"no\" on the combo meals as far as substitutions instead of saying the proper \"I'll see what I can do\" or \"it'll be this much more\". Server and cooks in the back even made jokes about being \"out\" of fries comments loud enough for us to hear, then later coming out saying it'll be out in few minutes (about 10 mins) with a \"smirk\" on his face. They need a makeover in management or this place will be getting more bad reviews. The 2 stars are for the food being good but -4 stars for all 3 times dining in.",

The server came up and tried covering up how rude she was to the hostess. However my friend and I both felt bad. She took our drink orders, returned with them and then took our food order. The food was pretty good. We had no complaints about the food. However our waitress, Janelle, quickly began rushing around. She never asked if we wanted more bottomless fries or another beer for my friend who sat with an empty glass.

I told my family it was going to be great, and convinced them to come with me to show them how good it was. When we got there, the wait staff was very friendly and I was super excited to get my prime chophouse veggie burger. While other tables were seated and served, my table waited 45 minutes before we got our food. When the burgers showed up, I forgot about waiting because I was so excited to eat! When we got the food it was extremely disappointing. The burgers were missing ingredients, and they just did not taste good. I'm so upset, and I hope the management improves this restaurant. I had really high hopes that it would be good, now I'm just sad and disappointed because I'll never have a veggie burger like I had at another red robin, close to home. Please fix your burgers.",

When asked which burger he suggested, his comment was one with meat. I was hungry and looking to have a good meal with good service, after all they're not the cheapest burgers. I was not in the mood for a cocky, rude server who apparently was having a bad day.  The reason I gave it 3 stars was because the food was actually good. The main reason was the following week I go bed myself in the same place and looking for a bite to eat, figured everyone deserves a second chance and so I went in again. I have to say, the server, an older women whose name I can't remember, was wonderful, she went out of her way to explain the food, points, best burger choices, in her opinion and really made me glad that I chose to give it a second shot. The good old fashioned cheese burger and the Whiskey burger are very good. The fries are really good, my favorite at any burger place. So aside from the staff that sometimes is good and sometimes not, the food is great.",

I hate to write a bad review, but the only thing good about our trip to this Red Robin was the service. The \"onion dip and chips\" appetizer was awful. The dip was soupy and the chips were soggy...I'm guessing there was a problem with the fryer because the fries were soft and soggy and the onion straws in my chicken burger were slithery and not crispy at all. The server did her best to make it up to us, and even brought the cronuts to us free as a desert...but they were uncooked in the middle too. I heard several other people send back fried things because they weren't cooked. The burger itself was under seasoned and quite bland. Red Robin better rethink the \"gourmet burgers\" sign on the building. With so many awesome little places in town to find actual \"gourmet\" burgers, I doubt we'll be back to Red Robin any time soon.",

However, shortly after ordering a couple and their son came in and was seated a booth away. After stopping the hostess and asking, \"is our waitress going to come?\", the hostess immediately went and grabbed their waitress and both came back, explained about shift change and apologized profusely. The couple proceeded to argue and ultimately demanded the manager. Daniel appeared a few minutes later to help the family, whose chief complaint was the waitress was too loud whilst apologizing! Seriously? Too loud? All while we are listening to their complaints! The manager again apologized while they interrupted with more complaints. Obviously their experience occupied our meal but I want to commend the staff here at Red Robin for going way above and beyond. We were truly impressed by their professionalism and the service.

They said you get a double and bottomless fries. I came in late to miss the rush. I ended up waiting 45 minutes for the burger and they brought it out. It's a double kids burger. Plus I think it's frozen patties. Good thing it was free. I'm headed to Applebee's for the 7 ounce steak. I had that last year and it's way better than this crappy kids meal burger. Pick a different restaurant for Veterans Day. I gave them a 2 because they still recognize vets, other wards this is a one for bad wait time and intentionally mid advertising the burger. Very disappointing. I changed my mind. One star. Being attacked by fruit flies at bar table. What would have been really bad is if I came with a group and everyone ordered and got nice big burgers and they give the guest of honor the kids meal. I bet that was an embarrassing scenario that played out over and over today",

    "text": "Absolute WORST restaurant experience we have ever experienced, and that says a lot because my husband and I dine out very often and both work in the service industry. We dined the evening of 5/24 and our server was BRENT. We arrived shortly after the couple we were treating and they already had their drinks when we arrived. Brent approached our table and without saying a word just stared in our direction, no greeting. We assumed that he was wanting to know what we wanted to drink so we told him. Brent seemed intoxicated while serving us, he smelt like alcohol, wouldn't make eye contact or converse with us, and was bright red and clumsy. My husband ordered a root beer float and Brent brought it in two separate glasses, one for the ice cream and one for the root beer. When he reached our table he spilt the root beer ALL OVER me and my husband! My pants, underwear and shoes were SOAKED and so was my husbands phone. And did we get an apology? NOPE! He through a towel at me to clean myself and continued to wipe down the table. Not a word. At this point we decided to inform the manager that we thought our server was intoxicated and that he spilt root beer all over us. All the manager said was \"I'll take care of it\" and again no apology. The server was gone another 10 minutes before coming back to take our actual food order. After that he kept glaring at us, wouldn't speak to us and was avoiding our table. The manager came out with the food and in front of Brent said \"so I talked to our buddy here and everything is fine!\" And again no apology!! How unprofessional! The only time we ever got any apology is when Brent handled us the bill he said \"sorry about the root beer thing\" totally unsympathetic and obviously because we were about to think about his tip. The worst part of it all is that we didn't get ANY sort of discount on the bill, not even for the root beer float! We had other places to be after dinner and I had to stop and buy new clothes because I was sticky and uncomfortable! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS RESTAURANT AND THEIR EMPLOYEES!!! Will NEVER be back!!",

Service was fantastic and food was awesome. Obviously the burgers were tasty because my little one ate the entire burger. Usually, she will only eat half a burger and say she is done. After the burgers, we decided to try two of their desserts (cinnamon sugar doh rings and chocolate fruffles.) Both are super delicious. The cinnamon sugar doh is a light donut that you can dip into two sauces, caramel or chocolate. The chocolate fruffles is a chilled chocolate covered brownie stick that you can dip in a berry sauce and/or whip cream. This one was my fave.  Sorry, I have no pictures to show. We just dove into the food and finished ... burgers, fries and desserts. We will definitely go back again.",

As I went in to Red Robin, the staff was talking to each other and tried to image if I was not there. So I waited until their conversation was finished. I was greeted, payed for my take out, and took the food home.  The Turkey Burger was ok. A little burger so small that had little veggies, small turkey burger, and buns. Guess how much it was? $10.80! Plus with the steak fries, it was soggy and not enough fried.  Go eat somewhere else. This restaurant isn't worth your time and not worth your money.",

Things here just seem really unorganized and needs improvement. All the severs look like they hate to be there and it throws off the vibe.

    "text": "I was so disappointed with our experience! The first negative moment was was when we were seated and handed two very dirty plates for the appetizers. The explanation we were given was, \"sometimes the dishwasher doesn't get everything.\" UGH.   For dinner I got the bacon cheeseburger with the bbq sauce, and garlic fries. The burger was nice and juicy, but that was the only highlight. The garlic fries were flaccid and boring - I was surprised. Maybe they'd been sitting around?  I didn't finish them.   For dessert we tried the chocolate shake with the Oreos. That shake was like milk - truly not much thicker than water, and the Oreos were all clumped at the bottom. Pretty gross. Overall, our two-person dinner, unfortunately, wasn't worth the money or time we spent.  The next day I asked a coworker who loves Red Robin about my experience and she was very surprised to hear about the dirty plates, limp fries and watery shake, and said the restaurant near her is really good. Although we're not willing to try Red Robin again, it is possible this location just isn't as good as other Red Robins.",

I don't know. Everything about it worked for me, and I got my medium with a bit of pink on the inside. The salsa burger was really cute looking, and though it sounded so bizarre, it was actually PRETTY GOOD.   Onion rings were way too gooey on the inside for me. And the breading was not my fave.

He was very attentive and made sure to check on us regularly. We got our food fairly quick. I was not impressed with the portioning of the chicken tenders I ordered. The amount of chicken tenders did not justify the price of the order. The fries were cold and the ranch seemed a little more watery than what I am used to. Overall I was satisfied with our waiter and not so much about the portions for such a high price. I may be back to try something different, but I won't be back anytime soon.

    "text": "They have really reworked the menu since the last time I was here. It's definitely not a paleo place to eat, but for a chain restaurant serving up burgers that's to be expected so I won't hold it against them too much. A lot of the menu items are quite delicious, however unhealthy.  I got the \"Red Robin's Finest Smoke and Pepper\" burger. My only real problem with this was that the burger patty I had was super dry, and a bit grainy. I feel like it was really, really low in fat, like maybe a 5% patty. Fat is flavor and moisture, and the patty was lacking both, especially moisture. The burger flavor that was there, though, was pretty good, and the sauce that came with it on the side was also good. They claim it has \"extra sharp cheddar\" and I think that's definitely wrong. Maybe medium cheddar, maybe, but still good.   The real star of the show the last couple times I've come have been the appetizers. Yukon chips and onion dip and tavern fries, and the bottomless normal fries. The Yukon chips and onion dip are delicious, and that dip is good for normal fries as well. Really delicious. If you're familiar with In-n-Out burgers and their \"secret\" off-menu Animal Fries option, you know what the Tavern Fries taste like, but with one major addition: bacon. They're like Animal Fries plus bacon, and they are absolutely awesome.  Hopefully next time I come here the burger patty will be improved. It was cooked perfectly so it definitely wasn't dry for being over-done. I ordered it medium and got exactly what I wanted in that aspect but just no moisture and short on flavor.",

I was good with the food as usual that would normally grant a 5 star rating however the sales motivated environment was a bit yucky.  As a former national trainer for a major franchise, internally it is all about Add On Sales. Appetizers, Drinks and Deserts. This is where the profits are as you are all aware when you dine based upon the offerings being provided by your server.  This night the sales pressure was on. I felt like the server was humping my leg for adds. The one thing that got me thinking the most was after I paid for the meal.  I was asked to fill out a survey. The server specifically told me that his shift consideration was based upon his reviews. Is this really the policy? Am I supposed to feel bad that if I don't do the survey this fine young man will not get shifts or possibly lose his job.  I am there to eat a frickin Royal Burger and not to feel pressure.  I guess this is what happens when a great restaurant becomes so corporate.",

I have had a very bad experience prior to this visit of Red Robin from small meal portions, not accurate orders and poor service but this Red Robin defies all. From the moment we walked into the door to the time we paid our check we had outstanding service. I've never had service like this from any food franchise ever the food was cooked to perfection and there wasn't anything wrong with it, the price was even reasonable. I can say because of this Red Robin alone I will be giving this business another chance. I would like to give a special thanks to Jessie for his hospitality and his professionalism while taking our order, he was clean, prompt, polite and I could go on for days about him but I'll leave it at that.   I wish I could give this establishment more then 5 stars but unfortually it doesn't work that way, I would also like to give a special thanks to the manager who checked with us during out visit, his name was Ryan! He made sure we were satisfied with our food and didn't leave us hanging!  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Burger which was cooked to perfection and had to be one of the best tasting sandwiches I've ever had (better then my wife's but don't tell her that) my wife also ordered French Onion Soup which was awesome and she didn't have any complaints. I did take the time to indulge myself in some of their bottomless fruit drinks I believe it was the Raspberry Limeade which was Epic in itself.   I couldn't ask for anything to go any better then it did on this visit, thanks Red Robin in South Summerlin for coming through and making it happen tonight for my appetite, I will be sending an email along with this review to your corporate office to make sure the appropriate people get their recognition!",

The waiter acted like he was selling me a used pinto with one owner. I just wanted a burger and ended up with apps I didn't want and sides that were all extra. If Friday's and a cheap tablet had a baby it would be red robin. We had to order our own apps and check ourselves out with a tablet placed on the table. Why not cook the food ourselves and bus our own tables. The bill was $50 for basically two burgers a beer/ iced tea. I will prob never go back.",

The table was dirty, the seats were wet from spilled drinks, and the floor was filthy under the booth we were seated at. The host made a poor attempt to clean it up. My husband found apples in his salad that wasn't supposed to have apples in it. Our table was hardly cleared of empty dishes. We had no silverware until we asked for them after we received our food.  The food was good though. But the service was poor. Unfortunately we won't be returning to this Red Robin in the future.",

Our server's name was Ashley, this girl was very rude and snobby and looked like she did not want to be there. We placed our not so complicated order and when the food finally arrived I had a feeling there was going to be some issues. My fries were cold and I  politely  ask Ashley to get me an order of fresh fries. She look so irritated and bothered by my request. Than my husband bit his burger and simply by his non verbal response I knew he did not like his food. He said five guys taste so much better and didn't even eat the burger because it was cold . We were sitting there waiting for some one to refill our bottomless drinks and fries. So my husband actually went in the kitchen to speak to the manager and asked him to remove his burger off the bill and the manager did. Than Ashley comes around and says \" I notice half your bill was taking care of anything you need.!\" First of all snob Ashley the reason why half my bill was taken care of was because your service was horrible and the establishment you work for can't make good, quality food. Buyer beware DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!",

The mac n cheese burger came without Mac n cheese on it. Sent it back, they were fixing it, didn't want my son's food to get cold so I told him to go ahead n eat. I got my food when he was already done with his.  Sucks to have a bday dinner when the other person is already done eating.  Then asked for a to go boxe, girl said she forgot, was double charged for my burger so had to wait for that to get fixed...

There are several dining spaces which are very brightly lit and have colorful designs.  The wait staff was extremely helpful, very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly. Although the restaurant was packed service was timely. The Pretzel Bite appetizer was a great starter. The pretzels were warm and soft. The beer cheese dipping sauce was the perfect paring. The DGB Burger consisted a a juicy beef patty with roasted tomatoes, garlic aioli and arugula on a toasted  ciabatta bun.  The Gourmet Cheeseburger was cooked just as ordered and included melted American cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onions, pickles and mayo.  The battered  Artic Cod Fish was crispy and fried to perfection. It is served with a tasty dill and pickled tartar sauce.  The burgers and fish entree all come with the bottomless steak fries that were not the bit greasy and delicious. Looks like this place is ready for it's Grand Opening",

A long Friday at work prompted me to invite my mom, who's never been to Red Robin, out for dinner here just because I wanted to eat my stress away with those unlimited fries. Prior to walking in, I warned mom that it might be a little bit hectic but surprisingly enough, we were immediately seated in a booth in the 21+ area. We had the sweetest server who immediately brought us our drinks. The freckled lemonade is so refreshing!   We opted for my usual RR favorites: the $5 O-Ring Shorty (Half-order of the onion rings with Ranch and Campfire sauce), the $6.99 Red's Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ the usual fixin's) and the $8.49 Pig Out Style Tavern Double (Double cheeseburger w/ bacon aioli and more bacon) and two sides of the Campfire sauce because I love pairing it with my fries and burgers.   I guess we got lucky on the service because our server was attentive and the manager brought fresh hot fries for every table without us even asking. Pretty much, mom & I had a wonderful dinner here. Crossing my fingers it'll be the same when we come back next time!",

Now that I think about it, I may have had every type of fry they offered... And some onion rings.   The bottomless rootbeer float is a good choice of beverage. My choice of a gourmet burger was the Sauteed 'Shroom which I thoroughly enjoyed. Whenever there's a mushroom and swiss on the menu, I always make sure to try it. And let me tell you, there was an abundance of mushrooms in my burger. I'd say there were about three fistfuls! I am not exaggerating.  The reviews here, so far, are pretty mixed, but I'd have to say that my experience resulted in a good meal. My server was lovely and accommodating. My friends and I were content, so I'm glad to have a Red Robin closer to my neck of the woods.",

I ordered a turkey burger wrapped in lettuce with bacon and guac. It came with a side which I kept as the recommended salad. The reason for the three stars was that while the turkey burger was excellent, the guac was a shmear and the bacon undercooked and did not look like the photo on the website. I tasted the famous fries and thought they were lacking in flavor. I will return due to the excellent service and management of the restaurant.",

We have been to this one the most because we like the location (although we live in North Las Vegas)  Staff - 5 Venue - 5 Kitchen - 3  We tried their new Poutine Fries that was on the menu this time.  It came out fast, within 5 minutes of the waitress putting the order in on their fancy ipad looking thing.  I was shocked the gravy that came out with the fries were room temperature and the fries were less than warm.  This made the whole dish lukewarm at best.  It still had great flavor, but I can only imagine how good it would of been if it came out hot and fresh.  My wife ordered her burger \"No Pink\" and most of it was cooked alright, but one side of it was almost as red as the tomato that was on her burger.  After we were able to let someone know of the issue they were more than happy to prep us a new burger and remove the cost without us even asking.",

Harrison our server was great and seriously one of the best waiters we have ever had. Food was also excellent and we didn't have to wait very long. As we were leaving though, the roaming acidity guard was in the processing of giving a motorcyclist a ticket for parking his motorcycle up against the building on the sidewalk (not in anyone's way). In the process of doing this, he parked half way in a handicapped space so he could write the ticket. To add some irony, he was mouthing off about how lazy people are. I tend to agree with him about the laziness of people these days, but laziness is not why that guys parked his motorcycle there. The security guard was just being a douche and he seemed to be tight with Red Robin's management too.",

We sat at a flat top in the bar and immediately greeted by a server/bartender, Cathy or maybe it's Kathy. She took our drink orders and brought them no less then 5 minutes later with a card explaining their loyalty program. She briefly explained it and took our food orders.  Our food came in less than 10 minutes, and she came to check and see if it was to our liking. My boyfriend used up all the ketchup so I just swiped some from an empty table next to us. She saw it happen and apologized and made sure we had a sufficient amount of ketchup. She grabbed the empty bottle from the other table and replaced it. She checked on us one more time during our meal.   We were in and out in 45 min.  I'm giving this place 3 stars on the food because it wasn't the best thing I ever had (All American Patty Melt and Regular Fries), but it wasn't the worst.  The service gets 5 stars. Cathy/Kathy was awesome she gave us awesome service. She gave us the perfect amount of attention and was as nice as could be.  During our lunch, a table next to us complained about the service and the food to the manager. As I eavesdropped, they ordered new food as well as 2 more burgers to go. Strange.

There were quite a few empty tables and the hostess seemed to only be seating the booths which were not comfortable. I think my returns will be rare.",

    "text": "Red Robin is my absolute FAVORITE place to go if I don't want to spend too much, but don't want to eat fast food. I'm going to compare Red Robin's Big Tavern burgers (regular sized burger)/Double Tavern burgers (two kid patties instead of one normal patty) to McDonald's meals to show that Red Robin is actually cheaper. On average, the BT burgers are priced at $8.99 while the DT burgers are priced at $6.99. Now this is including unlimited fries and unlimited normal sauce (as in not the special ones so ketchup or ranch, etc.). A McDonald's Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal is $7.43, but that's not including sauce because they charge for sauce now. So if you were to dine at Red Robin, you'd not only get a delicious burger, but also great service, unlimited sauce, and unlimited fries for $8.99/$6.99. If you were to eat at McDonald's, you'd get no service, an okay burger, limited amount of fries, and you'd have to pay for sauce every single time. So Red Robin is actually cheaper especially if you eat a lot of fries or like to have a lot of sauce. They added a new burger to the Tavern menu and it's basically a baked potato burger (includes bacon, fries, chive sour cream sauce, etc. all in the burger) and it's definitely my new favorite. You can't beat the flavor and the price. Seriously I'm amazed at how cheap the burger is for how great it tastes. Now as for the restaurant itself, it's clean and comfortable. The host always greets, the servers are attentive, and everyone is nice, but it's the nice as in they have to because it's their job. It's not genuine. Basically the staff is like any other normal place, but they weren't amazing enough to leave an impression until my boyfriend and I had Britni as our server. She was the only one who ever left an impression on us out of all the times we've dined at this location. She did such a phenomenal job and was really on it even though they were short staffed. We came Tuesday morning after the NAB convention and got seated. It took her a while to get to us, but she did stop by saying that she'll be right with us as soon as possible because they're short staffed. That was one of the good things she did because she communicated with us. She did look like she was very busy due to being short staffed, but she NEVER once forgot to check up on us, give us more fresh fries, fill up our drinks so many times without us even asking, and she was actually genuinely kind! You can definitely hear it in her voice and see it in her facial expressions that she was being kind like you were one of her friends. There's a clear difference between someone who is just being nice and someone who is genuinely wanting to know how you're doing or how your meal was and you can see this in Britni. I'll obviously come back as I have before so many times, but this time I'll be asking for Britni more often! Highly recommend requesting her as your server!",

    "text": "Worst service I've ever come across- If I could give no stars I would. I went out to dinner Saturday afternoon with a fairly large party and upon sitting we informed the server of how we would be splitting our check to ensure that there would be no confusion and he reassured us that it would be no problem. When it came time to pay the server divided the check \"evenly\" amongst all of our party members with the total coming out to around $13.50 per person. This did not make any sense as some ordered more than others and one person in our group didn't order anything at all. We finally requested that each individual pay for what they personally ordered and were instructed to write down what each of us received, we were then given new reciepts by a different server and payed our personal balances. The server returned and told us that our total balance was over $300 and that we were $80 short. One of the members in my party was willing to pay the $80 because we were running late to a function we had to attend, but then we realized that something was wrong- if all 17 of us were initially supposed to pay $13.50 then the total balance should have been $230. When we called the server out on her error she left and returned saying we actually only owed $20. She also complained to us about how \"her shift should have ended an hour ago.\" To make matters worse, none of us received the proper amount of change which leads me to believe that the server wanted to scam us out of as much money as possible, or simply does not know how to split a check or give proper change, which I believe all servers should know how to do. Overall it was the worst service I have ever encountered and will not be returning, I advise anyone reading this to take their hard earned money elsewhere and avoid being scammed",

Update they just messed up the burger for a second time. This was a 3 star review when i started now its a 1 star review. How do you not put guacamole on a guacamole bacon burger not once but twice?",

    "text": "Let me start this by saying I'm a big fan of Red Robin's. Unfortunately this location does not live up to the standards set by others around town. To start our hostess sat us at a table with no utensils or napkins. It was not until we had to ask a random bus boy for some that we got some. We then had to ask for the napkins separately because he didn't bring those either.   Waitress took 15 mins to bring water for us (it was 115 degrees outside) and it was a Friday afternoon. When she finally did she dropped off and proceeded to go back to the back without asking if we're ready to order. Another 10-15 mins later she came back and we ordered.   We ran out of water again and she did not come back until after the food was brought to us 20 mins later. She had to ask if there was anything we needed even though our glasses were bone dry.   Burgers had good sauce flavor, which is not really a chef thing, RR just has great sauce. Burger was ordered with some pink and they we super dry and over cooked. Asked for another one and that one came out the same. We asked for a refill on fries and she didn't bring any at all.   In conclusion if you're looking for a wonderful Red Robin burger and great service, avoid this place at all costs. You guys need to get your stuff together.   P.S. galleria at sunset is phenomenal If you live close or don't mind the drive.",

    "text": "Red Robin, why you slipping? I have had some acceptable experiences here, but after my last visit I am in no hurry to come back.   I recently had lunch here on a weekday with 2 coworkers. We were seated promptly in the bar area with no wait but service was quite slow from that point on.   It took our waitress about 10 minutes to come to the table to take our drink order. We have had her as our waitress in the past and she's typically on point, and we could see her interacting with other customers so I believe the delay was due to a staffing issue.   When she did make it over to our table, she not only knew what each of my coworkers wanted to drink, she also knew we were going to want a basket of bottomless fries to start out. She stated she'd put that order in right away.   A few minutes later, two of the three iced teas we ordered came out.  Then the third. Then our food. Still no fries. Well, I had the fries that came with my burger, but the fries that were meant to be an appetizer were MIA.   Our waitress apologized and said her manager would be by the table. Then we get the fries, but the basket was only half full.   The manager did come by, but wasn't very apologetic and didn't really do anything to rectify the issue. At a minimum, the fries ordered as an appetizer should have been removed from the bill.   The burger I had was actually really good, but the kitchen and management are not up to par, a good server can only do so much. I'm still debating if I will bother going back.

He made our dining experience fabulous!!  Food was cooked perfect!! This includes my well done burger. It was just right not burnt. Everything looked amazing and was absolutely delicious! 5 stars to the cooks for getting just the right amount of crisp to our fresh, hot, fries!! \"Hip! Hip! Hooray!\"   Definitely recommend this location.   Tip- ask if Drew is on. If you like a great waiter. His seating area is in booths located near the bar area of restaurant usually.

It was cold and windy outside, but inside was so much worse. Icy air blasted from the AC, and there was nothing that could be done. One manager came over to apologize, said their AC is controlled by corporate, which is in Colorado. I guess they're too stoned out up there to care. Later, that manager returned with another one, only to sympathize with us sitting in our winter jackets trying to eat dinner. Maybe offer a hot toddy?  Our waiter, Drew, was excellent. He brought me a taste of the house chardonnay, because I don't usually drink that and they don't stock Riesling. It was passable and cheap. Our food was hit or miss. Mine was a hit - I had the chicken bruschetta sandwich, served on a torta roll. I liked that I was able to get salad instead of the fries, without an upcharge. Hubby ordered the turkey burger, and wasn't happy when the bun completely fell apart, making it hard to eat. His fries were soggy, but Drew replaced them with hot, crispy ones.  I can't enjoy any meal when I'm shivering from unnecessary cold. Too many joints in Vegas blast the AC during the winter, but this was exceptionally bad, and that's the outstanding takeaway from this experience.",

We got sat quickly but had to wait 30mins to still not have our burgers. Since we were on lunch we had to go and instead of saying sorry and letting us go. Nope, you have to pay for drinks and the appetizer. No manager to apologize or say this ones on us and we'll do better next time. Just a shotty excuse that the cook is new. Also, I guess their $10 burger, fries and drink is only 1 per table...really? So don't bring friends or family if you want their anniversary deal.",

    "text": "DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS LOCATION.   They can't even handle 4 guests in the bar at 3pm on a Monday ???-- or perhaps they CHOOSE not to!?? The bar tender had no interest in serving me.   When I first entered, All of the tables for two were DIRTY-- after sitting for 5 minutes at a dirty table a male server finally came--I had to ask to wipe the hardened food slop from the table. He was kind and apologetic. Once my food arrived, I had to get up and walk to bar to get the sides I needed -- no checking back? REALLY? HORRIBLE LACK OF SERVICE  Water glass remained empty --- I was ready to check out ---FOR MANY MINUTES.....I put my card on the table --/no one in sight for several more  minutes -/ no one behind the bar. I push the electronic \"call server\" button   --it flashed red for several minutes-- no one came -- a server walks right past me, says nothing to me but chats to the employee sitting on the booth next to me (by the way who is watching videos on his phone  and not using ear buds--RUDE--. Finally the Flasher stopped flashing -- still no one came to check me out.  I needed to use the restroom -- so I grab my card from the table where I had set it and went to the restroom. Several minutes later I cane back to my table, no bill still and no bar tender in sight -- I walk back to the kitchen entrance near restrooms and ask a passing server if I can speak to the manager-/ at this point I STILL JUST want my bill so I can Leave. I wait-- SOME 30 seconds later I see the bar tender scurry over to my table and drop the bill. I still WAIT for the manager I had requested. The manager does not come. I decided I didn't need the manager now that i actually has a bill i just wanted to pay it and LEAVE. I walk back to my table and grab the bill-- the bartender and another female are in the kitchen entry way snickering as I walked past. I say, can I just pay my bill so I can get out of here please? The bartender was giggling with the server -- then the \"manager\" approaches - I say can I just pay my bill so I can leave? I have never been so ignored at a restaurant --- this has been a terrible experience -/ at that time the bartender passed and made a SNORTING -SNICKERING NOISE as she FORCED A LAUGH OUT OF HER NOUSE ---upon hearing my statement about being ignored .SO RUDE. How is this professional? Ever?. Now, provoked, I respond to her, \"oh you think this funny--she snapped back--forcing a laugh and scurrying off. Again I say, you alll have some serious issues here\" the manager then tells me \"JUST LEAVE\" --I respond that , you think it's ok that she snorts and laughs as I complain about her work eric? Manager says JUST LEAVE-- I can't have you yelling at my employees! To which I respond --- what?? You think it's OK that she SNORTS a forced laugh upon hearing my statement? He responded that he \"didn't hear it\" how is that possible! He was in closet proximity to her than I was. Again I say, YOU ALL HAVE Some SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUES HERE--and I exit the establishment.   The bar back is a frumpy, unpolished looking middle-aged-box-bleached-blonde. STAY AWAY  I WILL NEVER EVER PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN-- YOU tell me? Sound about WHITE? #SoundsaboutWhite #Summerlin #",

That was nice.when our order arrived they got it wrong. We ordered a chicken sandwich and got a burger instead. Waited 5 more minutes for correct order to arrive. Them the table next to us waited a long time for their drinks as well. They are way over staffed and can't get things done. I hope it's just because they just opened and are super busy. Let's see..I might give them another try in a month or so.",

Don't order lettuce-wrapper unless you want about 1/2 head of FROZEN lettuce which made the sandwich cold and very sloppy trying to get to the meat.  Don't order the Sriracha double burger because the sriracha onion straws are NON-existant.  There were a (very) few small fried onions.  We mentioned problems to the waiter when we asked for our check.  He, of course, sent the manager over.  The manager was sorry and offered to re-do the burger.  No, we didn't have time (or patience for that).  It's too bad the waiter never came back to our table after he served us--perhaps the problems could have been corrected in a timely manner.  Waiter forgot to adjust bill for a coupon and again the manager came to resolve the issue.  The manager did credit us a free beverage on the bill.  Then when we were leaving the manager offered us a $10 gift card to come back and try again. No thank you.  We'll give the gift card to someone else who might be interested in trying again--but not us.  We have a lot of other places with much, much better hamburgers AND service that we can go to.",

    "text": "Well, the only way I will go back to this store is if they do something nice for me and give me a comp. I ordered a burger called \"Southern Charm\". My rare burger was well-done. I do not eat dried out, overpriced burgers. I love a good burger, but this ain't it. So, I sent it back for something that was edible. After and long wait and everyone was finished eating, my burger came. Cooked medium and dry, but not as heinous as the first one. In the booth next to us, I overheard them getting a comp and $30 credit for their next visit. We didn't get much attention from the waitress or management. I made this my Red Robin location because it is closest to my home. From the looks of their rating here, I am not alone. I spent $56 on three crappy burgers and the fries that come with them. Palace Station has an excellent 1/2 pound burger for $3.99, which also comes with fries. So, you pay three times as much for a burger that is not even half as good. Fool me once, fool you. Fool me twice, fool me. The ice tea is weak, also. As a restaurant manager, it is plain to me that the cook cannot follow simple directions, which also then falls upon the manager's head because it is his job to protect his store.",

We had Pam as our server and she was the sweetest lady ever, if we do decide to come back hopefully we get her again. The food was decent, but it took SO LONG to receive, even our \"fry refill\" took 20mins! We got there at about 7pm or so and were out of there at 9pm right before our movie was going to start. The manager did comp us the dessert we had ordered and waited 30mins for and my friend did the free burger deal so all we paid for was my entree and our drinks but for having to be there for 2 hours when it usually takes 30mins maybe an hour at a restaurant was crazy! We are so lucky we didn't miss our movie (just barely) otherwise that would have made the entire experience even worse than it already was. We also sat in the bar area where this drunk guy slammed his glass down and it broke, luckily it didn't hurt us but that was awkward. Come on Red Robin, get it together!",

We did eat them, so I was just letting her know as the kitchen manger should know about issues like that. Then I got my medium rare burger cooked well done. The burger was slopped together and nasty. The fries were undercooked. You can tell the cooks there don't care at all about quality. We ordered a chicken  caeser wrap that was closer to rabbit food. Again,bad management.  When Ashley asked if I wanted a new one I said no thank you as the cooks don't know what they are doing, she then stated that I was having a bad night. Apart from the awful food I could have done without her curt fake attitude she so carefully developed as a disgruntled server. To top it all off they not only did not take the burger off the check but added an extra burger on the check like we wouldn't notice. Again, bad management. In the end they corrected the check but I will not eat at this place again. I'd be interested to see if the kitchen cleanliness matches the food and service quality.",

Was contacted by customer service who took my # and was told a customer service rep would call me and he did, Philip left a message with a case # and a phone # ( I was working and couldn't risk the call.) I called the # and Aman took my call, tried to give her my case # and she said she couldn't look it up but she could give me a new case #, which I let her do and hung up as that was all she could do for me.

After dining here several times, I have to say that I am very disappointed with both the food and the service. Maybe its the location, but the food isn't as good as I remember. The menu has definitely changed over the years. The Artichoke and Spinach Dip used to be large enough for a full meal. It also used to come with small pieces of garlic bread. This was very delicious back in the day, but now it is horrible - very sour and can't taste the artichoke or cheese at all! It almost tasted like chips with mayo. Gross. The bottomless steak fries used to be awesome as well. Nowadays, they don't even care to cook them very well and are horribly soggy. The generous portions of the fries have now been cut down to about 10 fries per plate. Surprisingly, some of my favorites like the BLTA Croissant, the Whiskey River BBQ Chicken Wrap and the Clam Chowder are still pretty tasty. I would also like to point out that the fruit salad here is awesome! Apples, Mandarin Oranges, Pineapples and Strawberries. Everything that I like! I love fruits, but I really can't stand Cantaloupe and Honeydew Melon.   Service here has consistently been bad and very slow. After the hostess sits us at our table, it seems like the wait for our server is usually about 20 minutes. Then when she finally shows up, we give her our drink and food orders right away because she took so damn long. Then what happens? Our appetizer arrives at our table before our drinks. Ugh, really?! Most of the servers do not even care to check up on us. Luckily, Red Robin has those Ziosk devices at every table so you can pay without having to wait for your server to bring you the check.  Come on guys, you have been open in the mall for a while now, time to get your sh!t together!!",

I think they are trading on their good reputation from a decade ago.   There are better places to go, trust me.  Table was so wobbly that we had to move tables, and they kept seating people there during our dinner, and they all moved.  Wife's meal was fixed wrong and had to be remade, the burger was smaller than in the past and the same quality as a fast food burger, the fries were room temperature, and they now charge for kids to use the electronic device they leave on the table and don't notify parent of the charge until you get the bill.  Wife refuses to return, which is good with me.",

We weren't seated right away, since we did come alt the peak of their lunch, but the manager and hostess adequately informed us of the status and we were seated in a reasonable amout of time.  I don't really remember many servers names but the one we had today, Walter was amazing!! He was slammed and we could tell,  but no matter how busy he was and how much running around he had to do (and he was running all over alot) he wasn't rude, he didn't forgot anything, he checked on us plenty and best part he was extremely friendly.   The food was your typical buger and salad place. We did try the tower of onion rings and doh-nuts...yumm!!!!",

I was super confused hence the empty tables and no one waiting but ok sure. We were starving and didn't want to go anywhere else. A minute later a server starts chatting up the hostess and some random dude. I look at the hostess and what a miracle she comes up to me and said \" A table just opened up.\" Yeah ok, this hostess was horrible. I've been a hostess myself and she has no clue what she's doing. The server saw us twice maybe three times and we were there for over an hour and a half. Just overall horrible service. This rating is a 2 because the food was good, but the service kills it.",

My friend and I are both limiting carbs, so I asked our server to substitute a different sauce for the premium ketchup that came with my burger. She charged extra.  It's a little thing, but it irritated me a lot.  I wasn't going to ask her to fix a $0.50 mistake, but I wish restaurants would train their workers a little better about things like this.",

They took our drink order and after that server came every few minutes to see if we're ready to order.   Placed order and sat. Food comes and we dive in. Now they offer bottomless fries but I  think. Why not give fries before meal gets there? Food arrives burgers are decent and the fries they deliver were sparse.    Ate half my burger and all my fries. Never saw our server. 20 minutes goes by still sitting and waiting hostess comes by asks if we need anything and we ask for more fries. Shortly thereafter she comes back and apologizes for the wait.   Eat my fries and i want more so i wait and wait and wait some more. Please note the dining area is thinning out.   Server comes around asks if i need my drink refilled and I say no because it's still almist full. I ask for more fries. I get this feeling hes tired because he stands there looking at me then says he'll be back I sit and wait and wait and wait. Then some guy with a tray walks by with fries. He stops at our table, walks away then comes back minutes later. He just puts the fries on the table and doesn't say a word.    I like Red Robin but this store needs to do something to win me over. I'm in the service industry and i have experienced better.",

Our server, can't remember his name, but he was awesome. Nice, attentive, informative. One of the girls in our group doesn't eat meat so she ordered a plain cheese melt (grilled cheese basically). We all got our food before her. The waiter came back and said they had been cleaning the grill so it would just take a moment longer. After a few minutes a manager came over and said that it got messed up so he was going to go make a new one himself. Maybe 5 minutes later, everyone else well into their meal, and she gets her cheese melt and it was not edible. The cheese had burnt onto the bread, and had tons of other food particles all over it. We let the server know and he seems embarrassed by it, he grabs the manager who then says he will try again. She politely declines and we ask for the check. The being us out the check and have comped a few things on the bill along with 2 deserts, so 2 stars for being nice and attempting to make it all right.",

They told her that they were going to leave and go to another restaurant, and the hostess simply acknowledged the comment and didn't bother to ask if there was a problem.  This location is apparently doing well enough to not have to worry about consistency with cleanliness or loud music at lunch - there are plenty of other choices in the area and they don't have to also worry about not having repeat business.",

Eventually a server helped him out and sat a party. We were seated at the bar area which was a mistake because our server wasn't very attentive since she had to make drinks for the entire restaurant with no help. We never had any utensils on our table and drinks were never refilled. The only other time we saw her was when we flagged her down for the check.   I ordered the whiskey river bbq burger with bacon and extra lettuce and sweet potato fries and bf ordered the prime chophouse with regular fries. We also ordered a freckled lemonade and a coke. I'm not sure if it was because it was close to closing time or what but my lemonade was very watered down. Food came out quickly though and my burger was delicious! Bacon wasn't over done and meat was cooked perfectly medium. It could have used a little more bbq sauce but I'd rather have less than have my burger dripping with bbq. I don't think I'll ever order sweet potato fries from Red Robin again... the fries I had were pretty soggy.   Also we never did see a manager walk around to see how our experience went. Usually at CPK and other restaurants we would. The staff definitely could have used their managers help. We did without the utensils no refills on drinks & fries was a bummer. At the end we were waiting for our check but you can checkout with the ipad looking thing on each table. (And that call server button doesn't really work btw). If you're a rewards members d have any rewards on your account you can just type in the phone number. Luckily we looked at our check because we were charged a $1.99 entertainment fee. My bf wanted to let it go because it took a while for us to get our servers attention but she came over and said she'll have a manager remove it. A few minutes later she came back and said she took it off because apparently the company did some updates so if you even TOUCH that iPad, you get charged the $1.99 fee. Ridiculous. After we paid, the darn thing ran out of paper so no receipt but we weren't about to wait any longer so we left.   So, I wouldn't recommend sitting in the bar area since service was terrible and don't touch their iPad. Just have your server run your card at the end of your meal.",

Reality - 4 chunks of avocado, 10 diced tomatoes, 4 small slices of chicken, a pile of fatty bacon chopped, a whole plate of lettuce and no egg. I actually had to ask the server for the egg that was supposed to be served with it. The Brie Burger was pictured with generous amount of brie with crispy bacon and all the trimmings, Reality - dry, lack of flavor, little Brie. Totally not worth the $14. The bbq chicken sandwich was pictured with crispy chicken on a bun dripping of bbq sauce with ranch. Reality - dry chicken tenders with such a minuscule amount of BBQ sauce that we had to order more BBQ sauce just to compensate. Totally not worth the $7. The dish that saved the one star is the chicken bruchetta sandwich. That one came out looking and tasting great! One star saved!!   The next star that was saved was our server Justin!

I was sooooo excited when I saw that they had bottomless root beer floats!!! OMG!!! ROOT BEER FLOATS!!!!! It was so delicious!  Our server was Red I believe that's what she said.  If not I'm so sorry!!! Hard of hearing! But she suggested I try the firehouse dipping sauce which was bbq sauce and mayo.  Omg!!! I wanted to put this sauce all over everything!  It was so amazing!  A creamy bbq flavor jus the right mixture of sweet and creamy.  Heaven in my mouth, YUM!  I got the country style burger it had bacon and bbq sauce with some cheese.  Amaze balls! And you gotta love the bottomless fries!  Our visit was great!  Our sever was on it.  And my root beer float,  ohhh so amazingly delicious!",

She was busy, seating guests, cleaning tables but was always smiling. Our server was great,  and so was my husband's black and bleu burger with sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions and bleu cheese sauce and crumble.  They do have a decent kids menu, burger was decent but the side of fruit was just terrible.. it wasn't fresh fruit, so icky my son could barely swallow.  I have always enjoyed their Ghost burger and if you love hot, this is the one you want. However they changed their veggie patty and the new one is so chewy, dry and hard. The other bummer is if you order ghost burger on veggie patty, you have to pay for the Big ghost which is $11.50 and not $8.50.  The restaurant is not that clean, dishes are not clean, silverware needs serious upgrade. For the price, this place needs to upgrade their cleanliness and dishes. My burger was served in a little basket, I would normally think that's for fries but they managed to put the big ghost and fries in this little basket, wonder how they expect us to eat. Had to request a plate which wasn't clean and was soaking wet. Ewwww",

It almost looked deserted, the hostess had a regular T-shirt on, I wasn't sure at first if he workworked there or not but he had menus and seated us. My husband ordered a regular cheeseburger medium well (little pink) and it was undercooked and cold to the point that the meat was practically raw. It was something you see in a movie, it was unreal. The side soup came in a small square what looked like a baby dinnerware. Crazy small portion. I should have taken a picture. I gave it two stars because the manager was accommodating and removed the hamburger from our bill but it's definitely not a place that I would return to unfortunately.",

We ordered quickly and then waiting for drinks for about fifteen minutes. Not too bad, but then half the table received french fries and the other half didn't receive any. Not terrible, but annoying. The food came and three of us didn't receive our meals until everyone else had finished eating! Now I'm a bit upset. Only half our table was receiving the refills we'd been asking for and finally we were asked if we wanted more fries. Not impressed and will not be back.",

My friend ordered the madlove burger and i ordered the veggie burger. Me being a carnivore and all, i asked them to sub the veggie patty for a traditional beef patty because, well, I'm not a vegetarian!!  The madlove burger was pretty good. The only thing that threw us off was that the bacon was so dang sweet. It almost took away from the rest of the flavors because it was a little too overwhelming.  The veggie burger, however, was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had! And to top that off with bottomless fries just made for the perfect meal!  We also ordered a couple of shakes and those were kind of ok. I finished my nana nana moo moo but there was a ton of chocolate in both of them. Again, a little overwhelming. Especially in the Oreo one. We expected more of a cookies and cream as opposed to cookies and chocolate with more chocolate shake. But honestly, overall, I'd come back to this location. We just know what not to get next time!",

No hostess greeting, and when she finally does come out, she made us feel bad and pressured since we were 20 minutes to closing. Look I understand it is annoying when someone comes in when it's almost closing time but we were in a rush anyways. We would've ordered, eaten and left within those 20 minutes. But to make a guest feel bad that \" you have to order fast\" wow. Super super horrible service. The experience begins within the first \"hello\" upon entering any restaurant. So it's just really disappointing for this restaurant to place extremely rude people to be the first impression. Good luck. Because your food is amazing, but your hostess' are putting a bad name to your restaurant.",

The bar area was super small, such that you couldn't just walk up to it. You still had to ask to be seated...at the bar! Then when you were at the bar the staff would hover over you like hungry vulchers, asking how your food was with every bite. It was annoying and claustrophobic. Plus, the burgers just tasted differently than other locations.  Recently, I decided to give them another shot. The bar area was cleaned out and the burger actually tasted like a normal Red Robin burger. One (and only one) bartender waited on me and she was courteous but not a stalker. The bar area is still cramped and set up weird, with the beer taps blocking customers from handing the bartender anything and vice versa, but they seem to be getting the location together and living up to normal Red Robin standards.",

I understand that someone can be busy, however the cardinal rule of waiting on kids is serve the kids first. We asked if some fries could come out to get my young one started, and the manager did oblige. The kid meal came out with rest of the food.  My main issue is that we would need something and then someone would drop off after awhile or not come back and check to make sure everything was ok. Wrong side items with food, wrong drinks, but because our server was busy, we just went with it. I would normally recommend but I am not sure if this was a fluke service or this location is not equipped to handle a decent size crowd.",

Awkwardly standing in front of the hostess a few min before she greets us because she's getting some menus together.   Took 20 min to get the waitress to take our order. Too busy doing setting silverware down, walking away, introducing herself, walking away, saying she'll be with us shortly, walking away. We finally get her to stay and she says we need to order drinks from the computer- useful information to know 20 min ago. Then she had to take our little computer thing because it wasn't working. Finally she comes back and says she'll take our order. I order everything at once because I'm over waiting at this point.  My choc shake comes- without the metal container that always comes with it. Some random had to bring it over.  My burger comes completely wrong- takes the entire time my mother takes to eat to make mine as originally ordered. So we both eat alone even though I asked for some fries to try and eat something together and those didn't come out until my new burger. Food was good- just wish you could eat with the party you arrive with.  Had to basically jump on the waitress to get anything- order placing, ranch, refill, to go boxes- I finally just asked for the check when my burger came right and my mother was waiting on me just so we could get out of there.   Horrible service. Horrible.",

The Summmerlin location is closer for us so we we decided to go there.  Service was okay. We were greeted quickly and our server was very friendly. The burger was very bland. The aioloi was very good but the meat itself was very flavorless. The fries were cold and old....pre-cooked and left under a heating lamp it seems.  It's okay for the money but I'd rather a Fatburger or In N Out for the quality.",

She turned the light on for help.  Nobody came so we asked for manager. He got crappy with us and accused my husband of cussing. Which he did not! The waiter snapped because we asked for sauce and he took so long we asked someone else for another one anyways. He said hey bud couldnt you wAit for sauce and not ask someone else??? Shocking! And we really just wanted one more sauce and didnt want him to have to go back again. I never got refills on waters. And my brother practically begged for more tea. I don't plan on going back there anytime soon.  And the smart mouth guys can kiss my grits!!!!!",

We sat at a booth and were constantly bothered by a child climbing over our booth. What was most annoying was the child belonged to a crew member eating with his family. Fortunately they left after 10 minutes so the crew member could return to work.  When our entrees arrived I inquired about our appetizer.  They said it was burnt and brought out another. Didn't want to eat an  appetizer with my meal. They didn't charge us for that.  Had to send both my kids meals back because because they were cold.  Both my wife's and my meals were average. Desert was good and price was reasonable.  Wasn't expecting any type of comp (didn't ask for a freebee) but apology seemed a little less then genuine.",

    "text": "Just tried this location for the first time on Saturday. VERY busy, but the wait was actually not bad. However, it was a very hit or miss experience for me.  Pros:  Everyone was very friendly, host guy was GREAT, waiter was nice and the manager who came over was also.  Burgers were good as usual. Cheese sticks and onion rings were also good.  Cons:   Service was pretty so-so. The kitchen seemed chaotic, and they were apparently having a very difficult time getting fries out.  Our waiter seemed great in the beginning, but forgot about us soon after, and was frazzled once we tracked him down. We asked a couple times for refills on drinks and fries. Drink refills came after a manager was involved (see below) and fry refill never came. Fry thing really bugged my husband as he asked for extra fries (which did come with the appetizers)  and mentioned to the waiter that he would eat a lot of refills, even as he ordered, so the fact that he didn't get one, was irritating.   Our daughters meal was wrong, and we had to send it back which prompted a manager to come over. He asked how everything was (he was very nice!) and we mentioned the lack of refills, very shortly after, the waiter brought them and mentioned they were on the way as the manager came to ask for them, and seemed irritated we \"told\" on him, I guess?? It was awkward.   Lastly, we got a pretzel bites appetizer which was TERRIBLE, tasteless, full of weird brown grease, and just YUCK. However, the manager took those off the bill for us, which was very nice.   So overall, while it seems like it was a more negative experience, the great host, manager, decent waiter, and burgers brought it up to 3 stars for me. Hopefully, they will get better about handling the crowds over there!",

First trip here during the Ragnar Relay left a group of us hungry beyond words. My second trip I trekked down there during Veterans. They were insanely busy on a Wednesday of all days and though the wait for a burger was long ''as could be expected'' they came through with once again positive service and a tasty burger.   The burgers are good. RR has a variety of different burgers and sometimes they throw in a limited time burger fixed up with all kinds of neat add-ons. To top it off they have a bottomless French Fries option sure to throw you into a starchy coma.    A final side note. Thank You Red Robin for Honoring Veterans on 11-11-15.",

It was around 8-9pm so we were immediately seated in the bar area.   Our waitress \"greeted\" us and shortly there after began complaining about her day due to the free burger promo.  Awkward City....but we pushed forward.   When I inquired about said promo she sarcastically/rudely said she didn't know because she \"just works here\".   She also forgot to take our drink orders but whatever no big deal.  Despite it being very slow we had repeated difficulty getting her attention for drink refills, condiments, etc... I'm glad the tavern burger was free because it was fast food quality and tiny.  Spinash and artichoke dip was good and the fries with season salt available at the table are good stuff.   Probably won't be coming back for promos anytime soon.",

Came in tonight (Saturday, 5pm), hostess was very friendly, smiled, seated us right away. No problems there.  Server came over promptly, was friendly and very professional. Took drink and app orders.  Drinks- ordered no alcohol, so nothing to write about there.  Apps- chips with salsa and guac, voodoo fries. Chips are very large and they don't give you hardly any at all. I thought they were bottomless, but I guess not. The portions of salsa and guac are tiny. Didn't even fill half of the (I'm guessing 3 oz) plastic ramiken. Voodoo fries were delicious. I had them without bacon (vegetarian). The cheese on them was delicious, and the fried jalapeno wheels really made the dish. However, again, rather small. I would not recommend sharing with more than 2 people.  However, it took forever to get to our table (right before the main course was delivered).  Dinner- I forget which burger the fiance had, but he loved it. I bartended at a gourmet burger place owned by a celebrity chef in a casino, so even though I don't eat meat, I know what a perfect \"medium\" looks like, and they nailed it. Good size too.  He devoured it.  I had a veggie burger with Swiss, guac, lettuce, onion, mayo, and added an egg- medium hard. Burger came out and the egg was not at all cooked. I like over easy, just not the mess, but most of the WHITE of the egg was runny. (I'm like, how do you nail a perfect medium burger, and can't cook a medium egg??) Server agreed it was gross and told me she'd get me another. Again, took forever for one over-medium egg. Finally it came, and it was over-hard and overcooked. Ate it anyway. Burger was tasty. Guac is very good. Steak fries were soggy on the outside and not all the way cooked on the inside. And NO FLAVOR, whatsoever. Even after drowning it with all the sea salt and seasoning salt at the table, they could not be saved.   Daughter had kid's mac and cheese with broccoli. She liked it.   Ordered 2 \"Cookie Magic\" shakes to-go. They were good, but filled barely more than half of the cup.  I would like to highlight our server Kris (African American young lady). She was outstanding, deserves 5 stars. I drink A LOT of tea, and my glass was never empty. She even refilled my daughter's lemonade before it was empty (which most places ignore the kid). Automatically brought extra napkins. Very pleasant and warm, and didn't miss a beat.",

After parking and heading towards the entrance we noticed the Red Robin signage and almost turned around as we are not big fans of chains. We kinda felt like they were trying to trick us with the signage. We have never visited a Red Robin, though, so we decided to give it a try.   Upon being seated we noticed 4 dirty tables that remained uncleared throughout our visit. The service was quick and our waitress was delightful, but we had to ask for napkins, silverware, and missing sauces after our meal was delivered. I had the Black and Bleu burger that, while tasty, is grossly overpriced at $14.99. My wife had a bowl of clam chowder that was served in a shallow bowl, only 3/4 filled. It came with a small piece of very burnt garlic bread. Luckily that's exactly how she likes it.   The beer selection was very small, but my wife's Long Island Iced Tea was excellent. Not a terrible experience, but definitely not worth $44 before tip.",

    "text": "As a frequent guest of Red Robin, I enjoy the familiar atmosphere, good food and drinks. This location however is not like other Red Robins. If you've been to other Red Robins, the food and beverages will be very familiar.  The decor and size of this Red Robin is squuezed.  What you'll also notice is that you have to ask for things.  Having to ask for refills is common.  The drinks do not flow here.  I also notice every time we visit that the place is messy. It takes a awhile to clear and clean tables. I did not see anyone interested in sweeping the floor which was a growing hazard. This last visit we  brought our family, we observed five tables sit over 15 minutes from the time people left to the time it was cleared. What got me counting was how long our visit took.  We were seated within 5 minutes which is great for a group of six people. From there it took ten minutes for a drink order. This appeared common for other tables and is common on most of our visits. We ordered meals with our drink order from there everything was suprisinlgy quick. Our meals came quickly and as we normally expect, they were delicous. Then the pace came to a crawl. We had to ask for refills. Here we watched a number of wait staff begin to flow out the door. This was between 7:30 and 8pm. We waited patiently to order desert for 15 min. We had told our waiter that people were looking forward to desert at the beginning of our meal. When we flagged a waiter it took 15 min for our waiter to arrive and he had our check in hand. We asked for desert and our waiter was pleasant but overwhelmed. The resturant was only half full at this time. Overwhelmed staff is normal at this localtion. While we are waiting we notice more staff leaving, no tables cleared and the floor is a hazard.  Desert comes we all finish up and a normal meal that takes less than an hour at other Red Robins is almost 2 hours here. This is not uncommon for this location. We pay our bill and they somehow lose our cards. Gift cards and whatever bonus card thing is gone. I got my credit card back luckily but was so dissapointed.... again. I still tipped at my normal 20% but was very tempted not to tip at all. I'm not sure if this problem was our waiters fault or an overall issue. Why should I punish my waiter when it appeared the whole store had iasues. We spoke to the manager about our experience and let me note we were given a gift card for half the price of our meal. This was a nice gesture but it's a repeating problem. There is Five Guys behind this restaurant that is about the same price with a better burger but I like atmosphere. As we walked out, we walked out with three more staff. As we turned back the same five tables that had not been  cleared were only just being cleared but we could now see it was a worse issue throughout the restaurant and not just our section. Could all those staff who were leaving cleanup before they left? With all the choices around it will be sometime before we return to Red Robin here in Las Vegas.",

Once inside, we asked for the sweet potato fries as our bottomless fries...20 minutes later we got 1 basket. I asked several more times, and they kept stating \"they are working on them\".  We were here almost an hour and NEVER received more fries. This is what Red Robin is known for.   Red Robin needs an overhaul on their hiring standard, or its training methods. Serious customer service issues.  The food is always good, and that's the ONLY reason I still eat at Red Robin.",

The host was no where to be found and the place wasn't busy at all! Well 10 minutes past and finally the host comes up to us and there was a line behind us already. When she approached us, oh my gosh the young woman's breast were half way out and drooping. She didn't even ask \"how many\" or \"how are you doing\" she sat us down on a filthy table and slammed the menus on the table. When our waitress came up and assisted us. He was incredible and funny! I love the way Jaime assisted us and give his honest opinion on his favorite plates. If it wasn't for him I would most likely be rating this place 1 star. Jaime deserves a raise! Jaime is the guy with the sparkly nails btw :)",

Got the spinach artichoke dip and it came out in what looked like a sample bowl.The chips were light and delicious and you can tell it's homemade. But the dip was still good. Wish they gave a little more for the price. And maybe not have raw onions sprinkled on top. I always get the Banzai Burger but decided to be adventurous and try the French Dip.  It was pretty good. It has great flavor. And i love the taste of horseradish. That is honestly my favorite part. The cole slaw is tangy and delicious. And how could you go wrong with bottom less fries!!",

It took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up and take my drink order. I ordered a beer which didn't arrive for another 6 minutes. I had to give the waiter the evil eye as he was walking past the bar and that got him to order the drink from the bartender, so I don't know when he was planning on getting it if I hadn't done anything. During this time frame a woman had sat at the table next to me and already left from lack of service. Nobody even bothered to at least bring her a menu. I was starting to wish I had just left the place as well.  I ordered the blue ribbon burger with garlic fries which took 14 minutes to arrive. I slowly sipped my drink during this time because I didn't want to wait forever for another one. For the amount of stuff that comes on the burger, it was surprisingly kind of bland. The garlic fries were good but they gave a very small portion and I ate through them very quickly. By the time I was almost done with my burger I finally got my fries refilled. This time they were horrible and inedible. It tasted like they just dumped the seasoning all over them. I finished my burger, paid and got out of there feeling very unsatisfied. I have no plans on going back there again.",

The host wanted to seat us at a table that was right in front of the path that leads to the kitchen. I asked if we could sit at a booth to keep the kids sitting down. He seemed irritated about my request. Possibly because most of the booths were left dirty. The booth he ended up sitting us in was the largest booth in the place.   Our waitress was very nice and bubbly. I forgot her name but she was skinny with brown hair and used words sweetie and cutie a lot. She took our drink order and left so I order the kids their lunches. When she came back she took mine and my husbands order. She let us know that the kids meals would be out shortly and then she left. She brought us a basket of fries (which were cold and they tasted like the oil was dirty but we didn't say anything since she brought them without us asking for them).   The kids food was delivered shortly after and then my food. The waitress had to come back to the table to get my husbands order again and acted like oh yeah that's what I thought you ordered and it's on it's way out. I think the order was forgotten or never placed because he didn't get his burger until we paid. Both of the kids and I were done eating and they were getting restless so he was rushed to finish eating.  What was going to be a quick bite to eat turned to a 2 hour meal.",

We did get service, eventually, but there was more of a wait, untypical of our usual visits. For this, I am giving 4.5 stars.  There are five tavern burgers at $6.99 (comes with fries). The burgers usually look like the pictures in the menus- this is what hubby always says. The food is solid. Bottomless steak fries (I like that they give you a smaller amount because they used to give you too much). Seasoning. Yummy. And you can substitute the fries for sweet potato fries, too. Hubby's favorite is the cowboy ranch tavern @ $9.49- bourbon BBQ sauce, onion straws, American cheese, & lettuce. I like the Sir Acha @ $9.49- onion straws, lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo, American cheese, pickles. I have gotten burgers protein style as well (no bun). I have tried the other sandwiches (chicken & fish), the wraps (chicken), the shakes, and the freckled lemonade (yummy). I didn't try any of the soups or the salads. I keep going back to the burgers. Our son loves the kids meal @ $5.99: meatballs on a stick- 9 of them and sauces, plus edible breadsticks, too. Our orders are accurate.      We used to go the Galleria location the most, but since this is a more convenient location, we've been coming here. The waiting area in the front, has cute burger-themed stools, so cute. (And there are so many choices to eat at inside Downtown Summerlin!) I like the size of the restaurant. I also like the use of space. The booths and tables are the middle and the right of the restaurant, while the far left side has the bar (that is, from entering the front doors). I also like the interactive display at each table- it's convenient.   Always clean. Always busy. But you'll get a good burger here.",

For reasons unbeknownst to me, my husband enjoys coming to Red Robin every now and again, but we absolutely refuse to come back to this location as the service is egregiously bad.   This is not a one-off service blunder. No. We've been to this location a handful of times and service was consistently sloppy, but the last time was the last straw.  My husband and I always get bottomless salad rather than bottomless fries. What is the one tool that a person needs to eat a salad? Forks. Our waitress delivered our appitizer of wings with no napkins, and delivered our salads and lettuce wrapped burgers all at the same time, with no silverware. Our waitress still hadn't come back to check on us by the time we were completely done with the wings and burgers. While my husband went to wash his hands and look for forks, a busser walked by. I flagged him down to ask for 2 forks and napkins. No drink refills while we ate (yet bad servers are always raring to top up your cup as you pay the check, as if it matters then.) There's a real lack of customer service at this location and it comes from the top down.  How can a restaurant offer bottomless anything when a server doesn't even check on you before you finish eating your entree? Is this some sort of scheme to make sure nobody gets a refill on their bottomless offerings? Who knows. We left no tip and we're not coming back.",

After having avoided this Brand for 14 years,(the last RR experience was in Phoenix and it scarred me forever.), I very reluctantly joined a group of friends for a burger here today.

Let me begin by saying that our server and service was great.  She was attentive but left us to enjoy when we needed to.  Kind and brought refills and sauces quickly. Upon receiving my burger, I noticed two things:  it was over cooked: as in charcoal well done.  If a burger has no temp, no matter how thin the patty may be, medium to medium well should always be the standard in a burger joint.  Rubber Grey matter with flecks of white gristle aren't my idea of a burger.  Second, I could literally thump my finger on the buns and they had a hollow *thock!* sound to them and broke into breadcrumbs when I put my hands on it to lift it from the basket.  This raised concern not only because they were obviously stale buns and not, in fact, over toasted... but because I'm allergic to mold and I was instantly worried about eating the bread.  The waitress brought me a 'new' bun that felt and tasted like a kitchen sponge, so... I removed the brown, transparent and wilted lettuce from the meat patty and tried to eat through the ultra tough meat and crusty dried cheese.   I have honest to god had a better 1.99 double cheeseburger from Burger King.  Shame on you guys.   The fried were excellent and a redeeming quality even though we only had one refill.  We also enjoyed the Caesar salad dressing a lot... but that made the disappointment even worse as NOBODY should ever rave about the side dishes more than the restaurants claim to fame. Bottom line:  get a burger from a fast food joint or Applebee's... this is consistent low quality from a brand that should take their star dishes more seriously.",

I ordered fried pickles, onion rings and French onion soup and my husband ordered some kind of burger with an egg on top. All very delicious!",

    "text": "I haven't been to Red Robin in quite a long time, mostly because of the service, sadly this time was no different! I truly think it's just this location, because the one on Eastern & Silverado is always great!   Upon entering we had to wait for a table, not too bad for a Saturday evening. Hubby and I weren't sure what we wanted, but our two little girls were hungry, so we ordered theirs first. They had the kids cheeseburgers with fries and chocolate shakes. Bar was a little backed up so the shakes did take quite and bit, and extremely thick, they had to wait for them to melt to indulge. Shortly after we placed our orders as well.  Once the kids food arrived, we were confused as to why one of our daughters dinner was served on a small side plate , over crowded and really hard to find room to cut her burger, or place any sauce for her fries. The waitress was no where to be found, she really was MIA the entire time! Carrie was her name, if I'm correct. Mind you the restaurant was busy, but not packed. Her lack or attentiveness has become common at  this specific Red Robin!   Anyways we asked someone else, guess they ran out of clean plates, still use a different place or just kindly explain. Fortunately as we were waiting for our entrees ( teriyaki chicken burger, and a classic turkey) one of the managers came over and saw we looked displeased after waiting so long. He kindly  brought us our salads first. Shortly after our food arrived, still no waitress in site.   Finally another manager came over, yeah the management did a better job of servicing us than the actual waitress, he asked us if everything was ok. I was very honest about the service , and he kindly offered us a complimentary dessert. We weren't able to grab it though, because by the time we asked for the check the waitress totally forgot. Add a crying baby in the mix, we just wanted to leave, after the entire dinner was far from smooth.  I really hope the management does a better job with their servers, as I said the food is never really the issue, but the service always is below standard. That's really the reason we tend to opt for other burger joints in town, although Red Robin has a great menu, with so much variety. Nice managers, good food, poor staff.   Would love to come back, if the service improves!",

The reason I am giving this particular Red Robin 3 stars is because of the speed of service. Yes the staff is friendly, however when we first walked in to get seated, there was no host at the podium. We waited for about 5 minutes, with other parties behind us, before a host appeared to finally greet and seat us. Then once we were seated at our table, it took another 10 minutes before a waitress came by to take our drink orders. By that time, we had already made our selections, and ordered our food when they took our drink orders, in fear that if we waited, it would be another 10-15 minutes before getting our food order taken. This restaurant is very slow.",

I am just not sure why Las Vegas has a hard time with customer service, this is a hospitality town that is really really bad at customer service. My husband and I wanted to try Red Robin. We usually hit another burger place, we wanted to see if Red Robin would be better. We walked in about 2:30 in the afternoon, it did not seem that busy, yet no one greeted us when we walked in, no host anywhere in sight. We must've waited about 10 minutes before someone came to the front. Once they arrived, they seemed rushed, not happy to see paying customers at all. He said, follow-up me to your table and seemed to run away, and it took me a minute to realize I needed to follow him. Once we sat down the waitress was nice enough but very slow and the burgers that were brought out to us were cold. Once we set the burgers a side, we waited for about 15 minutes she then came over and asked if we wanted dessert but when she did that she did not clear the table. I had to ask her to take our dirty dishes away. Over all the experience was disappointing. We will definitely not be going back to this Red Robin location, in fact not sure we'll ever go to another Red Robin again.",

I called the restaurant and after being placed on hold for very long time and then placed on hold a second time after asking to speak to a manager, I was told, it wasn't their problem that GrubHub had to handle my refund.   Not only was the manager dismissive, she didn't do anything to try to keep me as a customer. It was a $38 order. She was very, \"oh well\" stuff happens to bad for you. When I told them that another customer would be affected, she said, no we took care of that customer but there is nothing I can do for you. Really disappointing.   I did get my refund by GrubHub but that was another ordeal. No more Red Robin for a while at least not take out and probably not at this location. IF they are too busy and have to much business, perhaps they don't need my order or business anyway.",

We came on a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty busy. We were able to get seated at a bar top table though within about 10 minutes.  Our sever was pretty spotty throughout the meal. We seen him maybe once just to place our order, didn't receive refills on our drinks at all and ended up checking out our own bill on the table tablet. If the service had been a bit better maybe I'd give an extra star because the food was pretty decent. I had the Burnin' Love burger with a veggie patty. I loved the spice, but probably could have done without the fried jalapeno coins since they were soggy. The fries were what we really came for and those hit the spot.  Overall it was a decent visit, nothing too out standing nor too terrible. I'd probably come  back again and try a different burger next time.",

    "text": "Tonight was our daughters 4 year birthday, so her mom asked her where she wanted to go and she said to her favorite place, Red Robin. We hadn't been to the downtown Summerlin location so we decided to give it a try. We were seated and our server Tabitha took our drink order and we told her that it was our daughters 4 year birthday. She said that she had a birthday sundae for her at the end of the dinner. When the sodas came out, I could tell that they were flat before she even set the tray down on the table. I said \"It looks like your soda is flat\". Without skipping a beat she said \"No not at all,it is fine\" and then rushed off to deliver the rest of the drinks on her table. Not being convinced, I took one drink and confirmed that it was flat and gross tasting. As I was waiting for her to get close enough to flag down, I took a closer look at the glass of soda and there wasn't one bubble in the thing. Anyone that was paying half attention could have easily seen that it was flat when they were pouring it. I flagged her down and asked her to bring out an iced tea instead. We eventually ordered our food and it came out on-time. When she came back to check on us she asked my daughters mom if she wanted a drink re-fill. My iced tea was sitting in front of my plate of food (90% empty) while her glass was off to the right at the edge of the table. I then began to notice that this girl is not paying attention to anything. She didn't ask if I wanted a refill because my glass wasn't in her line of sight. When she brought the drink refill I waited for her to check on my drink, which I pushed closer to the edge, but that didn't even get her attention.       So given that great demonstration of anticipating your guest's needs, I was eating my dinner without anything to drink when out of the blue Tabitha re-appeared with some other servers to sing happy birthday to our daughter. They sang the song and she plopped an ice cream sundae down like she was Santa Claus delivering the presents on Christmas Eve. My daughter's mom and I just looked at each other. We weren't even half finished with our dinner and my daughter was still eating the first half of her toasted cheese sandwich. I put the ice cream sundae back on her tray and said \"Put that in the freezer please and bring me a drink refill\". \"We still have to eat our dinner first\" She looked confused and once again I could tell that she wasn't paying attention to anything about our dining experience. We ate our food, paid the bill and got out of there.        One thing to remember, is that I could see the open kitchen and the female manager was cooking along side of the employees in the back, Her time would have been better served by being in the dining room and observing the lack of effort that was going on there. After crap service like that, I usually don't come back. I might give them another try, but it's not on my list of things to do anytime soon.",

I, for one, can eat a lot and take advantage of the bottomless fries, drinks, salad, etc. but I've found after asking one or two times the servers become quite curt and avoid you, or take forever to get your request to you. Either they need to limit the customer's expectations if they aren't going to follow through or they need to get more staff to meet the flow of orders/re-orders.   One time the waitress in the bar section stinted our table for so long the manager had to stare her down and talk to her about continuing to serve us.",

It's like eating at a place that's one notch over fast food. But even then, I've had some fast food burgers that are way better.   The steak fries are like big soggy potatoes.   The service was horrible. It was not busy and we kept having to ask other waiters to get our waiter so we could order. He also screwed up our checks and ran the wrong cards on the wrong tickets. We even had him correct it when he passed them out wrong. We had separate dividers and he still ran them wrong.   Never again.",

The dismal amount of toppings was unforgivable no matter the price.   No cutlery or napkins with the delivery. I'll order the chicken sandwich next time and hope for better luck.

    "text": "All Red Robin locations tend to be pretty much the same. However, this one falls shorter than the rest. We stopped in here due to an intense craving of fries, aka Red Robin's staple item.  My friend ordered some sort of burger and I ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger with a veggie patty instead of beef. I emphasized the patty swap several times. When my sandwich came out, I noticed it looked more like meat. I pointed this out to the food runner and was reassured that the manager was plating food, so this was CERTAINLY a veggie patty. Okay, fine. I took one bite into the sandwich and knew instantly it was indeed beef. This instance was the first time I'd eaten beef in over two years. I alerted the waitress about this and she took the sandwich back without apology. The manager brought me out a new sandwich, apologized profusely, and explained that the wrong sandwich was grabbed. He offered me a comped sandwich and dessert due to the error. Okay, fine. I didn't have much of an appetite from there, but I ate some of the sandwich and it was alright. Pretty run of the mill, as expected.  For dessert we ordered the Mountain High Mud Pie. The name is quite telling and the pie is huge. It's approximately 90% ice cream, but it was good enough and got lots of gasps from our table and those around us.  Though the manager attempted to make up for the error experienced with my sandwich, I still find it wholly unacceptable. Definitely would not return to this location.",

It started off good with the hostess at the front they where very attentive and quick to sit us. The server was nice, used dry humor, but it seemed as if where more of inconvenient to have to serve at some point. We where not given nor offered straws. Why does management tell the employees not to serve the drinks with no straw and wait for the customer to ask for it, just because the restaurant wants to be Green all of a sudden.  If I may make green suggestions to Red Robin please consider using recyclable paper/cardboard straws for your guest, it would turn out to be more beneficial for you, your guests and the environment in general.   This location always has ample parking and there plenty of shops to visit before of after your meal. They have a great reward program too. I mean who doesn't like to be rewarded for eating and earn points for free and delicious food. Oh and you also get a free burger on your birthday, just saying ha ha ha.",

It's also a plus that this is a family friendly establishment that I can take my little picky eater to. The last time I was there we ordered a milkshake after our meal. It was near closing and Brittany was busy with multiple customers. I waited 20 - 30 minutes -- It was late we were tired and no one knew where our milkshake was.

The hostesses act like you're not even there til you make your presence obnoxiously known, one even answered the phone while we were standing directly in front of her and the podium.  The waiters are okay up until you get your food and then you're left wondering where they went for the rest of the meal, and yes, that means no refills, so save up!  The tables are all left covered with food from the last guests are there. The entire time we were there the table next to us was left with drinks from the last party, and our own waiter just kept piling everything onto that table instead of taking it to the kitchen.  Terrible. If you're really in the mood for Red Robin, drive to a different location for better service.",

Drinks arrived half at a time. During the waitress second trip I told her we were all ready to order our food.   An hour later we start getting our orders (half them) ..... it took another 20 mins to get the rest. By that time our food was cold.   It seem the waitress was busy with other tables to attend to ours, other people came ate and left and we still sat there..... she should have asked for help! The place was not busy at all so I don't understand what the hold up was.   After talking to the manager and expressing our concerns he disappeared...... he didn't care, He was standing in the kitchen waving bye as we left.   Safe to say we will not be returning..... we will be warning everyone not to go.  Management has changed and now it's going downhill.",

This time my husband actually went down to restaurant and order in person. After getting home AGAIN to find another missing entree!!! It certainly isn't our responsibility to go over every item!!! When I called and when it really made me angry. The manager said they don't have a delivery service so I can either come back and get the entree or he could credit me.

Stupid does not destined the staff - maybe incompetent or just plain morons.   We then ordered our food and the chips were still there. We ordered three salads and one wrap. All the dressing was given on the side even though we didn't ask for it to be on the side. The salads were poorly made and food lacked any real flavor. I feel like I could have gotten more flavorful food out of a dumpster.  The \"manager\" came by and took my moms information, but didn't even comp her salad for her inconvenience. But I'll be contacting corporate so her dumb a** need not do any real work.  Overall DONT come here. Waste of time and money. Unless you like bland food and moronic staff then this is your place!!",

    "text": "Although having bad experiences already at this location, my daughter LOVES Red Robin and the distance to drive to the Henderson location from our house is not worth it. I received a message from management from my last visit (and Yelp post) requesting my info, but upon my response, never heard back.  Do not come here with any sort of expectation. This time, my fiance, daughter and I visited around 6pm on a weekday and were seated promptly. (Female, didn't get her name) server came by and was very friendly. Very personable. I noticed they didn't offer (at least on the menu) the kid's Mac and Cheese like they normally do. (My daughter always gets kid's Mac and Cheese with 2 sides of broccoli). On the regular menu they offered a \"grown up\" version,  like $13, which had extra stuff (truffle oil, bread crumbs, etc) which is great, except my daughter only eats plain Mac and Cheese. I asked if we could just get it plain, like they used to offer on the kid's menu, and she said it wouldn't be a problem. I ordered a burger, substituting a veggie patty, with extra pickle, and added a spicy aioli, of sorts. Fiancee ordered a burger, forget which one, but there were no issues with his order.   I've been bartending (and have served) a long time, and while we were waiting for our meals, our server was quadruple sat... and sat and sat.. Of the tables she had that I COULD SEE, at one point, she had 11 tables. Needless to say we never received refills, my fiance and daughter's food came out a good 10 minutes before mine. My daughter's Mac and Cheese came out with all the \"adult\" added stuff on it and her broccoli was cold. When mine finally arrived, I had not one pickle, although I asked for extra, the aioli I requested was non-existent, and the veggie patty was so overcooked and hard I literally hit it on the plate and it didn't even fall apart. When we finally flagged someone down, my fiance was halfway through his meal and my daughter was hungry so she ate the cold broccoli, so I figured I'd deal with the disgusting patty and asked for the pickles and aioli. Aioli came, no pickle. I was done. Sent back the mac and cheese since it was going to take forever for another, and sent back my veggie burger. I was munching on the \"bottomless\" fries while waiting and was never offered a refill of, like, the 6 fries they actually give you. Our drinks were never refilled. Which 100% was NOT our server's fault because she was running around like crazy with all her other tables. She apologized profusely and said the manager was going to come talk to us (she offered, we didn't request), and about 15 minutes later she asked if he had come by (which he hadn't). She apologized and told us to hang on. Eventually, a man casually saunters over and said \"so, she didn't like the mac and cheese?\".. Seriously?? I showed him my disgusting veggie burger and explained the situation with the mac and cheese, and he acted like he was doing us a huge favor by taking the mac and cheese and veggie burger off the tab (which we never ate). Seriously, at least one of your servers is in the weeds with all these tables and you're not even on the floor to help out where you can?? She was giving poor service to everyone simply because you can't be in 5 places at one time. While we were waiting for him to come over we ordered a split milkshake (fully intending to pay) but he did comp that, also, without request. PLEASE get better people to run your store. Hats off to our server, who gracefully dealt with all of her tables and running around, and was still smiling. Wish I caught her name.",

We just went again for the third time after months in between because of the bad service each time, and once again another bad experience.  Every time we order ice tea we have to then wait 20 minutes for sweetener. Every time we ordered anything other than fries as a side, we have to wait extra for the side we ordered.  This time will be our last time at that location. It is not being run properly.  What a shame because if it were up to our daughter we would go there every week. My husband and I are extremely patient, but after many times of asking for what we needed from multiple people, not once did a manager even try to visit our table to check in.  Oh yeah, and not one single balloon available and expected by children there when we entered and not one balloon available when we left over two hours later.  I saw a poor guy with his infant circling at least 10 times waiting for his group's food to arrive.  I have a gift card that I got with my credit card points, but I'm just going to send it to my cousin in another state because this location is the absolute worst!",

I'm a small business owner and she is the type of employee I would hire in a heartbeat. It's so nice to have your waitress help you order your vegan selection in a burger restaurant !!! Love this place and particularly this location.",

Now, I do think that in the years that have passed since I last visited a Red Robin, that the portion sizes have gotten smaller (especially that initial serving of fries), but the taste is pretty much still the same.   I also want to compliment their restrooms (yes, I know that's weird). I don't think I've been in a public restroom that is cleaner! That says a lot to me- there's nothing worse than going into a nasty bathroom!   Anyway, burgers, fries, friendly service, clean, and reasonably priced- Red Robin does it!",

    "text": "This review is for my dining experience on Wednesday, March 29th at about 8:00 pm.  My server was Brianna R. and my 2 star rating is by no means a reflection of her service.  I am a server myself and there are certain things that I experienced during this dining visit that should not have happened.  Plus, the complaint I had should have been handled a little more professionally by the manager on duty and not fall on deaf ears.  Here is what happened.  My daughter and I arrived to the restaurant, and it was fairly busy.  Not really a wait at the door, but a normal dinner rush for a Wednesday night.  There was a few people in front of us waiting to get sat, and we were taken to our table within a few min.  Hostess was very nice and polite.  Our waitress Brianna arrived to our table a few min later to take our beverage order.  My daughter and I both ordered the flavored peach tea.  A couple of min later she returned with our drinks and took our food order.  My daughter ordered the chicken strips with the bottomless fries, and I ordered the prime rib dip with onion rings and a starter side salad.  About 5 min later my side salad arrived. I was kind of shocked to see the size of the salad and how small it was for $4.99.  The plate was literally 2 inches by 2 inches and maybe about 3 oz of salad.  Basically, I ate the salad in about 5 bites.  $4.99 for that?  Really?  While halfway through my side salad, our main courses arrived.  Now, being in the service industry you would think that you would allow your guests to at least finish their appetizer before bringing out the main course.  But, at least the kitchen was putting the food out fast.  My daughters said her chicken tenders were just ok, but the fries were cold and stale.  She was hungry enough and ate them anyway, but again, they were cold.  My prime rib dip sandwich was ok, but the purpose of the jus dip is to be flavorful and soak into the bread and be edible.  However, my main complaint was the fact that the prime rib jus dip was like grease water.....literally!  I brought this to the attention of Brianna, our waitress, and she apologized and told me that she would notify her manager on duty right away and have him come by.  About 10 min or so after that, I was done with the sandwich and the onion rings and I had pushed my plate to the end of the table NEVER seeing the manager!  It wasn't until Brianna came back to the table to clear the plates when I told her that the manager never came by but I was already done eating.  I asked her for the check so we can just get out of here; I was clearly frustrated.  She apologized again, and said she would go get him.  A few moments later the manager came by the table.  I never got his name as he never introduced himself to me, he just approached the table with, \"Hi, how are you.  Brianna said you wanted to see me?\"  I explained to him my issues about the jus dip, told him that I had waited for him to come by, but he didn't so I just finished my meal anyway without the jus dip.  He said that he appreciated me telling him and that if it's not brought to his attention then he can't change it.  He could also see and hear how frustrated I was with the experience, but all he said in his departure from my table was that he thought he didn't have to come by, thus, blaming Brianna's communication with him stating that I didn't need him to come by.  Clearly, a big breakdown in communication happened here.    After waiting about 10 min more, Brianna came by once again just to make sure everything was resolved. I told her that my experience was not anything having to do with her because she has no control over the kitchen or what the managers do.  However, I did recognize her for the fact that she got triple sat, including our table, and did the best she could for that little pop she got.  So, again, no negative reflection on her.  Brianna then asked if I wanted to pay cash or with credit, and I told her that I would just use the little kiosk on the table to pay.  While she was standing there, I showed her the bill and I was absolutely amazed that the manager didn't even bother to take anything off the bill or even offer any type of dessert to make the situation right.  Let me be clear about this:  I am not looking for a free meal, but I have been in the service industry for over 20 years and have even been in management.  There is no excuse that can be made that would warrant a manager not doing anything or offering anything to make the situation right.  With all of the different dining options that are available to choose from in that same area, what would make me want to come back to this Red Robin and eat again after this experience, let alone any Red Robin for that matter?  Instead, the manager passed the blame back on the server.  I ended up paying for my full meal which came to $41.36 and I rounded up to $50 for the tip.  Again, no negative reflection on Brianna because she was great, but I won't be back!!",

Took about 10 minutes until someone came up to seat us and when she came up she looked very dirty and couldnt even look at us or smile at us. Seemed very unhappy and unpleasant. Then told us it will be a few minutes when there was about 50 open tables. When we were seated the server came to help us after like 10 minutes of sitting. She was cery busy so we understood. Her name was Ashley and she was very nice. Food was mediocre, nothing special. Experience was good other than the rude person feom the beginning.",

It's not like some of the local places so if you're looking for unique, bypass here.  But I love it here because you can get seated quick and get a delicious burger with bottomless steak fries.  Service was great when we went which was the second week of opening.",

They definitely tend to overcook the burgers and you're lucky to get any pink at all but they're still juicy and tasty despite that.  Pros: Big fat steak fries with seasoning and smothered in ranch, doesn't get much better than that. Burgers are always tasty, even if usually slightly overcooked.   Cons: Would like more pink on the burger and faster service.  Will continue supporting all Red Robins and getting my usual Banzai burger.",

Worse case is we would walk over to sushi loca if they were closed.  Walked in and there was no host. Walked back all the way to the bar just to get service, only to find the bartender on his phone. We decided to sit at the bar  because  the game was on. As we waked to our tables the bar was gross, and tables were full of old food and drinks and wet napkins. I almost wanted to walk out but we decided to stay. The bar was dirty too, and of course the bartender wiped down the bar with a smelly rag. He took our order and our food came out quickly. Sandwiches were hot but fries we cold. I got up to wash my hands in the restroom and only to discover the rest of the restaurant was dirty. Wet napkins all on the floor, along with food crumbs and old drinks. Meanwhile all employees were out by the bar on cell phones, laughing and joking with the managers. Prolly will not come here again based on how dirty the restaurant was and the lack of unorofesisonalism of staff. I decided to be nosey and look at one of the checks left on the dirty tables... We came in at 9:30 pm to eat and the check said 7:38pm so that means the mess was left on the table since that time. Ewwww! --- update I gave this place another try and it came out better. I will only dine in if ****Mindi*** the shift manger is working. She has great customer service and runs a tight ship! Thanks Mindi!!!",

I have been here 3 or 4 times usually in the early afternoon after the lunch rush and the one thing that has bothered me are the tables are always dirty or sticky. I get walked by at least 5 tables that still are full of dirty dishes and glasses.  The food is what I expect, a decent burger and fries with a cold drink. Service is also the same basically friendly and that is it. With this being said I still like going here just wish the management would work on cleaning the tables as soon as the guests leave.",

I ordered my burger with no mayo and I actually saw her write it down. For the first time in a long time I had complete confidence that my order would come out correctly, and boy it sure did! Her name was Kadie Lee and insure hope we get her next time! Looking forward to our next visit!",

We ordered a small order of onion rings and a wedge salad. Both where ok. Then we ordered our burgers which came out and I believe the Sonic hamburgers are just a little bit better than the ones we where served. Our waiter never came around to see what we needed. It was us and maybe 2 other couples in that area of the restaurant. We push the call server button on their table electronic thing because we wanted more fries. He never came but I would see him chatting up with his co-workers at the end of the bar and then chatting up again at the ent  rance while our little light kept flashing on their device. Fed up we got up to leave then he finally showed up and said he was sorry for the inconvenience. Yeah dude whatever I still left a tip but only $2. I called the restaurant to speak to a manager after we left pressed Option 4. And nobody ever answered. Won't go back again",

It was absolutely fantastic! Great flavor and it included tomatoes and avocado on it as well. Fantastic! Our waitress was very sweet and had that good old southern charm.

    "text": "Gourmet Burgers? Not even close! I would recommend Fat Burger and In & Out Burger before I would recommend Red Robin.  We ordered the \"Big Whiskey\" and the \"Black & Blue\".  I have not eaten a Whopper since I was a kid, but after trying the BW, I now remember what a Whopper taste like. Seriously, I thought I was at Burger King. The only difference was the $12 that Red Robin charges you for the burger. Then I was offered the option of parmesan fries for an additional .99 cents. I was served old fries that were cold and broken in small pieces.  The Black & Blue was good. It was made with Black Angus Beef, mushrooms, and blue cheese. It was served on a ciabatta bun.  The service was good. We were greeted by a hostess upon our arrival and she also asked us how everything was before we departed. The server did a fine job and a woman that appeared to be a manager stopped by our table to say hello. The server brought us fresh fries after I brought the old fries to her attention, so I did not bring it to the managers attention. The cooks should not have sent the fries to the table though. Also, when I asked the server if the meat they used for the Big Whiskey burger was USDA Choice, she said she would ask the kitchen staff. Upon her return I was notified that there was not anyone in the restaurant that could answer my question.  Summary: $37 for two small burgers, two drinks, and two sides of fries.  I do not recommend Red Robin as place to go for burgers.",

Both my chicken breast and my husband's hamburger were cold - not like it was once hot and cooled off, but like barely made it out of the refrigerator cold. We had no silverware and I actually walked to the kitchen to ask for some. The poor hostess came out with two forks and said that was all they had.

She had our back and provided honesty and good service despite managements COMPLETE lack of customer service. Honestly I wish I got this managers name so I could complain to corporate. He lied to my face about the beer cheese and argued with me and never apologized. I had to ask to take the beer cheese off the bill when it came out at the end of our meal to enjoy with some cold pretzel bites that were supposed to be the appetizer. Le sigh. MAJOR FAIL RED ROBIN.

I give it a five star because the waitress assigned to us tried really hard although I sensed attitude she still put in effort. Her attitude was mostly all good.   Food: Its really good. The burgers we ordered was very nicely done and definitely satisfying. Very fattening. It was a 13.99 burger. With the strawberry drink it 4.45. Altogether 41.99. With extra garlic fries.

Apparently the management at RR have no faith in their cooks to do their jobs and run your meat through an oven on a conveyor belt. So much for quality.    This was easy, simple and satisfying place to bring the family.  Good thing I have other burger options that are better and cheaper",

    "text": "I am normally a fan of Red Robin but after this experience I will definitely not go back to this location. We arrived late for lunch, probably around 1 pm. It was not very busy but the servers were rushing around and it took a while for ours to come up. They seemed very under staffed. I ordered a draft beer and water. My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and water. It took about 10 minutes to get the waters and lemonade, and then the server told me they no longer carried the seasonal summer ale, in May. I picked a different one but heard another server telling a table next to us they were out of some other draft beer. After we ordered our burgers it took about 20 minutes to get our food. After I  took a bite I  realized that it wasn't what I ordered. After another 10 minutes of no server I went to the host stand and told the hostess. She came back and looked and confirmed that it definitely wasn't what I ordered and took it back to the manager. Then she came and apologized. A few minutes later our server came back and apologized. I said it was ok and asked for mayo. The entire time my wife had not taken a bite because she wanted mayo, and had been waiting about 15 minutes at this point. Another 5 minutes or so later i got the correct burger from the manager, who also apologized. At this point I was frustrated but they whole staff was very nice and as I mentioned, I suspected they were under staffed, so I said it was no problem. That's when it all turned way worse.  We finished our food and the server stopped by. my wife asked for a to-go box. She brought it right  away. Another 10 minutes later she came back and asked if we wanted anything else before we left. I told her we were good for our check. She said ok and went to the table next to us and offered them their check. A few minutes later she brought them their check and then asked the table on the other side of us if they wanted their check. Another few minutes goes by and she comes out with theirs, then walked away. My wife was furious so we just went to pay on the table kiosk. It was then that we saw that we were charged for all 3 burgers. The server originally put in the wrong one. After another 10 minutes of not seeing our server or the manager, we manually split the check on the table kiosk and paid our portion, then left.  I'm still fairly certain they were under staffed, at least when we got there. By the time we left, which was at least 90 minutes later, if not more, there were at least 3 more servers that I did not originally see. But I now also think that the staff was not very familiar with their food or drink menus. The manager did make a correction and apologized, but no one offered anything to make up for it and didn't even care enough to fix the check. That, coupled with barely being available on the floor demonstrates that customer service is not much of a priority. The food was good, but you can get a good burger other places too, without waiting way too long or trying to track down an employee.",

That's why it pains me to give three stars to a company I have been so committed to for literally over a decade as my Burger joint hotspot.   Alas, my last visit didn't go so hot. Food was delicious as always so I don't want to unrealistically give 1-star. Place was clean as far as my eyes had seen. I was greeted by a very cheerful and friendly hostess, but I will say (in effort to not let our main server be singled out), that the three servers we encountered while there weren't the friendly bunch. I got eyes rolled on two separate occasions. Once when I chased the server down for a size upgrade on the shake. And once when a separate server collected my cash on behalf of our server and asked \"did you want change?\" When I said yes he rolled them back as well and said \"Kay.\" as he mean mugged his way  into the kitchen. Our main server didn't do anything particularly mean herself, she just wasn't really that pleasant at any point.   I love Red Robin. I'd get a tattoo of the logo if it wouldn't guarantee a lonely future. I say this because I want to express \"you're better than that.\"",

    "text": "So now I understand why this place is 2 1/2 stars. I was craving a burger and my boss goes let's go to Red Robin. we get to Red Robin . The waitress hands us out menu . She see's my name tag so she asks if we're on break we say yes but we have an hour so we have time to eat . We get a appetizer the spinach and artichoke dip. And we ordered a few burgers with fries really nothing fancy or specially making at all. 3 more guests come in and sit . As were waiting we get refills on our drinks and the spinach is done and nothing . The lady says we have a new cook sorry for the wait we understood, but then 2 of the guest that came in got there and we still didn't get ours. At this point we are 40 minutes in and she came out one more time just to tell us that it's almost ready like really are you serious . So we said look we have to go we won't have time to eat . She said ok let me go cancel the order . I'm thinking she's gonna bring a manager to apologize but nope she brought us the bill for the spinach and lemonade which hey I'm ok to pay it since I ate it but damn not even apology for waisting my lunch time. So pretty much my lunch was half of spinach dip since I shared it with my boss and a lemonade. So if you have lots of time to spare then this is the place for you but if you don't stay away because they won't serve you in a proper time nor will they apologize for there mistake .",

The dining experience wasn't awful but it certainly didn't blow my socks off.  I usually have a lot more to say in my reviews but I guess my lunch here wasn't that memorable.  Overall, I would say my experience here was okay.  I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could.     We ordered: -Fiery Ghost Tavern Double ($8.49) - my mom ordered this, she really enjoyed her burger but she thought it would have been a little bit spicier because of the jalapenos on her burger, she also noticed her burger only came with fresh jalapenos even though it was supposed to come with both fresh and fried jalapenos -The Southern Charm Burger ($13.99) - served with bacon on a ciabatta bun, I thought this was just okay, also ordered this to be medium rare but it came out more on the well done side, the ciabatta bun was a little on the soggy side, I opted for the onion rings instead of the fries and the onion ring breading would just fall off every time I would try to eat/bite it. A little overpriced in my opinion.",

I ordered a chicken Caesar salad to go, when It came out it looked awful; dry lettuce with a chicken breast on top. If I hadn't asked for tomato's it would've looked lifeless. When I asked the lady at the to go desk she really didn't have answers. A random waiter happened to walk by and she asked him if this was how it was supposed to be? He listened to what I thought was wrong with the salad and without missing a beat said to me that he would fix it. Sure enough 3 min later the waiter and salad were back every one of my concerns addressed and remedied. The waiter was polite, professional and spot on with the service he gave. I wish I got his name so I could put it in here. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is cause I haven't tried the food yet.   (FOR MANAGEMENT) the waiter was medium build 5'11\" ish short hair scruf beard and tattoos on both arms. Let that guy train all of your servers and you'll have so much business you'll need a bigger location.",

Came in armed with a free birthday burger coupon (join their e-club for yours!) and opted for the Arctic Cod, in a lettuce wrap. Subbed a cup of chili for the fries, and added on a wedge salad. Food arrived hot and fresh, chili had a good spicy kick to it, service at the bar was attentive and engaging throughout.   While the service is good and the food isn't bad, their meals are extremely average for the $10-15/pp pricing, hence why my visits are pretty rare (maybe twice a year).   Note that the bar is not visible from the entry- possibly to preserve the family-friendly-feel? Go in and hang a left to find it. Bonus points for being one of the few stand-alone restaurants in the Downtown Summerlin area, making for easier parking.",

They couldn't even say someone would be right with us.  Greeting someone shouldn't be part of your job, it's called being a decent human being.  We walked to the bar area, the guy was super nice greeted us and told us he would be with us soon. If I didn't deal with any of the other BS he would have made this a 5 star review.

But from the minute we walked in there was no hostess to greet us, a server walked by and made no attempt at getting us a hostess. After about 5 minutes we finally got seated.  Boyfriend ordered the Black and Bleu which was decent and I ordered the Taco Tavern double which was an utter disappointment. What should have been two patties, lettuce, guac, salsa, and tortilla chips came out looking like a double cheeseburger from mcdonalds with a few pieces of lettuce a pitiful teaspoon of guac, and cheese- my salsa and tortilla strips were nowhere to be found.   We told the waiter who then got it taken care of, but even with the missing additions now on the burger I couldn't get over how this burger was one of the worst I've ever had. Salsa tasted like the bottled ones from the market. There was such a small amount of lettuce that I forgot it was there. Guacamole? What Guacamole? And the patties were even level with mcdonalds. The best thing was probably the cheese.   Bottom line, we will not be going back as the night ended up being nothing but a disappointment.",

    "text": "Located in/near the perimeter of Downtown Summerlin, you will find this Red Robin location next to the Panda Express. We had dinner after watching Suicide Squad with a couple of friends of ours. The 4 of us decided on Red Robin when trying to figure out where to have a quick, casual bite to eat.  (+) This location is relatively new and is very clean and has a fun, festive atmosphere. Plenty of TV's and seating available (+) the bottomless fries were actually pretty tasty and I did enjoy them. I noticed during our meal that we had to be fairly proactive about asking for refills. It just seemed like they weren't going to volunteer or offer refills willingly.  (-) I ordered what was marked as a new item, the Clucks and Mac and Cheese ($12.50) and later my friend treated me to a basket of bottomless fries (sorry, I didn't catch the price). The mac and cheese was a pretty small portion. Even worse, it didn't taste all hat good. Very bland and watery. When I ordered the clucks, I assumed they would be regular chicken fingers, but they were lathered in a buffalo style sauce, which I am not a fan of at all. Instead of interrupting the flow of the meal for my guests and myself, I decided to just give it a shot.   Eh.   I just didn't care for it. It does come with a side of ranch, which made it a bit more tolerable, but I was wildly unimpressed.  (+/-) Service wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't very good either. The young man who helped us was nice, but also seemed a bit lackadaisical. One of the burgers was ordered without onions and came chock full of onions, sauces were forgotten, and the bottomless fries plates were taken away with no offers to refill it until we pushed the issue. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but the service was just not very good.  (-) Our friends tried to use their Red Robin rewards points card and it was nothing but hassles and issues just trying to get their \"points\". Seems like a lot more hassle then it was worth.  I left Red Robin just very unimpressed last night with absolutely zero intentions of ever coming back. There are just too many good places to eat  this town, and even in Downtown Summerlin,  to come back here.  2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better.",

    "text": "First time at this Red Robin, but have visited numerous Red Robins throughout the country so I have a source for comparison. First the place was 2/3 empty, my wife and I were offered the bar, or a table. We could see at least 10 empty booths from where we stood. When we asked for a booth, the host went through a song and dance about finding a booth that had been cleared, surprise...... she found one within 15 seconds.   Waitress comes to the table, dumps cutlery and napkins in pile, doesn't bother to place in front of my wife and myself, no coasters. Asks if we want to order drinks while we are looking at the menu, I asked what beers are on tap. We are directed to a blackboard in a far corner of the restaurant that the waitress can't even read, she then decides she will have the check and get back to us. I understand on tap beers change, but a cheatsheet in your pocket at the start of shift takes a minute. It is 7pm on a Sunday, how many times has she been asked this question today?  My wife orders a Guacamole Bacon burger, she's asked a question I have never heard in a restaurant before \"pink or no pink\"? Translation, our cooks have no training and have never cooked a hamburger before, or the waitress thinks we have the minds of a six year old. Then my wife is asked if she wants fries, garlic fries, various other fries, or onion rings. No mention of the cost of the upsale options. I will say this, I will order whatever I want regardless of price, however I can see this practice adding $10-15 surprise to a large partys bill, it's wrong. I order a Royal Red Robin with onion rings.  We get our drinks, still no coasters. Food comes, burgers are OK, but we've had better at Burger King to tell the truth. I really object to shredded bagged lettuce on a $13 burger, someone is really cutting corners. My wifes garlic fries are cold, greasy, under cooked, but unlimited. My onion rings were cooked in old, dirty grease and were disgusting.   There is absolutely no excuse for any restaurant cooking in old, dirty grease, most especially a national chain that is supposed to have written standards. If you don't know how to clean your fryers, or lack the proper equipment to clean your grease....THROW IT OUT!  When it comes time for the bill, we're directed to the DIY electronic checkout device on the table, which will also conveniently calculate the tip incorrectly for you. The tip should be based on the cost before taxes, NOT including taxes. I just tip on the total including taxes, but trying to slide a higher tip in under the radar is not a convenience.  I don't complain in restaurants, ask for comps, or make a scene, I just never come back. I wonder how many other patrons of this Red Robin have felt the same way?",

Food was amazing, and prices were more than fair. Everything came out quickly and was hot and delicious.  Here's the thing....I saw management. There was obvious discombobulation in her appearance, which probably resulted in things just not being organized throughout the restaurant. Something about the atmosphere was off, and I find that is usually is a result management needing retraining or replacing.  Looking forward to going back to see Corinne. Corporate, pay attention to your management at this location and I'll bet you can turn things around in no time!",

Had a going away dinner last night for my nephew and we ordered only two sodas but it showed up on three checks because we paid dutch.  Couldn't understand why because 7 of us had water.  I never got a refill nor did I even get a visit from our waitress-terrible service.   Never again will I go back.  $14+ for a lousy burger!!  come on...the price should have been around $5-6 bucks.",

The service was slow and the food was average. FIVE guys across the parking lot would have been much better.  On top of the bad service and average food the bathroom and the space itself were not well maintained for a restaurant that has been opened since what..November?  Clean the bathroom and get the kitchen grease off the floor.  I won't be back.",

    "text": "This was by far ny most frustrating experience  at a Red Robbin. I check the reviews of this location versus the other two, and there is a reason people don't like this location. Totally bad experience last night. First off, when we were seated, our waiter screwed up our drink order, then took almost 20 minutes to make the simple change we requested in the first place. Our burgers were pretty good as always, but our french fries were ice cold, and ever refill we got was ice cold as well. The fries were disgusting all night long. Our waiter seemed more interested in standing around in our plain sight socializing with coworkers,  than seeing if we were ok. we were there for almost an hour, we seen him 3 times, and once aas to talk our initial order.  if I was the manager of this Red Robbin, I'd really try to see why more people prefer the other locations as opposed to theirs, and take a serious look at what they're doing wrong.",

    "text": "Literally just left the restaurant, and was compelled to write this review while my dad is driving my mother and I home. We were seated in the bar and Marco, the bartender waited on us. The whole time he acted as if we were such an inconvenience- he was not friendly, he seemed distracted, and it was a struggle to be able to get his attention to ask for anything. Once we were finally able to flag him down, my mother asked for more fries, but before I could even request anything, he already bolted off. It was like pulling teeth to get any service from this guy, he never asked how everything was, never offered refills, and he barely listened or acknowledged when we did ask for anything. Mind you, there was one other couple in the whole room- it wasn't busy, so I don't know what this guy's deal was. We finally paid and got up to leave and he practically glared at me while we were leaving. Thanks, man. I've never felt so uncomfortable having dinner with my parents in my life. You really shouldn't be working in customer service with that bad attitude and arrogant personality. I've never written a bad review before, but this experience really pushed me to it. I even called the restaurant back just to find out this guy's name. I love Red Robin, but this experience was crap.",

    "text": "Bad service.  The funny thing is, they had me fill out two surveys since then, and I reported the issues in detail, but nobody took the initiative to contact me back.  It is as if corporate has some great idea, \"Hey, let's implement surveys!\" but lacks the connectivity to actually do something when a problem is brought to their attention through the survey.   What's the use?  Not only has Red Robbin taken my money over crappy service, now they have taken my time too, to no avail. My take is that a few guys in suits want to show their investors that they care, force surveys into the company-wide protocol, but the rest of the Red Robbin team lacks the capacity to act upon the results, to even try to improve, or even care.   There are plenty of other good restaurants in the area.  Let this one go out of business so we can replace it with people that care, IMHO...   IT'S ABOUT SERVICE!!!",

    "text": "I've been to this Red Robin a couple times before and always had a very slow experience. My waiter's name was Ralf and he was extremely forgetful. I ordered a cheeseburger plain with pickles on the side and I had to ask for the pickles twice after receiving my burger. My group also ordered chips and salsa/guac as an appetizer.  While ordering, I asked if it was possible to have it cut in half (I was told mini burgers were no longer served) and he said it would be no problem. My girlfriend ordered the Royal Robin burger and requested ranch and thousand island on the side.   He finally surfaced with our food 25 minutes later and our appetizer.  I don't think he understood the concept of an appetizer...it was chips and pre-made dips it really should have came out shortly after ordering. I didn't get the pickles I wanted on the side nor did we receive the ranch and thousand island dressings per my girlfriend's request. My burger wasn't cut in half which would not have been a big deal except Ralf never gave us any silverware or napkins. We had to wait around until Ralf came out of wherever he was hiding to get silverware. Thankfully I had a bunch of napkins in my bag, so we just used those. Also, our drinks were often empty and Ralf would be, once again, no where in sight.  Very disappointing service and I don't think we'll be back especially at the high price tag. The host was pretending to answer the phone and texting on her cell phone behind the podium during the entirety of our visit. Also, when you go to the bathroom you can see into the kitchen and there were so many waiters/waitresses just standing around.  With the slow service we had there should have been no one standing around whatsoever especially since it wasn't busy in the restaurant.",
