APPETIZERS - the bang bang shrimp was the savior of the night. The best thing overall. MAIN COURSE - The presentation was LAZY. I felt like I was at a high school cafeteria. The taste of the grilled fish and the crab cakes was good, but not exceptional.  Besides that, the ambience is cozy and welcoming; and the food was served at a leisurely pace.",

    "text": "Holy fried seafood, Batman.  Between the Singapore Calamari, Bang Bang Shrimp, and Fish and Chips, I think I've had my fill of fried food for a while.    We started with the Singapore Calamari and Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizers.  The calamari is generic, with too much breading for my tastes.  It does come with some fried peppers, which was a nice treat.  The Bang Bang Shrimp is their most popular appetizer, and consisted of crunchy breaded shrimp in a very mild sauce.  Both the calamari and shrimp were supposed to have a spicy sauce, but on a scale of 1-10 they were both probably a 0.5.  A positive is that the portion sizes are very generous; if you're not sharing, it could be an entree for one.  I opted for Sir Will's Fish and Chips because the description said it was tempura style, and because the fish was tilapia instead of the usual cod.  The fish itself was really good, nice and juicy and again, generous portions.  Sadly, the batter was less tempura style and more Long John Silver's style; a giant block of fried batter that encased a filet of fish.  Crunchy and thick, it didn't do anything for the fish.  I don't think Bonefish Grill would ever be my first choice if I'm at Town Square, but I also wouldn't dismiss it if someone else wanted to try it.  Based on the tilapia in the fish and chips, I'd want to try their grilled fish entrees.",

I was a big fan of this place.  The second...  Atrocious - 1 star (only because they have to get at least one) Our waiter was rude... First thing he said when he came to our table was 'are you all 21?' (our group ranged from 28 to 40s...) He proceeded to take our drink order, and at the very end asked for our IDs - Why not do that at the beginning? And why the attitude? * He didn't bring our waters - first thing we asked for... * We had to ask for bread.. Our waitress the first time brought it out first thing! * My martini was about 3/5ths full this time... I didn't know I paid for a partial drink!  I am giving this 2 stars due to the bad taste left in my mouth and the fact I will not be returning.  If you do go, stay away from the waiter with a tattoo of a blue ball or something like that on his arm... He will ruin your experience. Consistency is important and this place does not have it. And so is employees with a good attitude!",

The service here was divine (as it always in anywhere remotely near the Strip), and the starting bread and pesto was refilled frequently enough that we had to make an effort to save room for the main course.  I had the seared tuna paired with a pinot noir. Definitely as good if not better than I thought it was. My friends had similar success with the daily specials and ahiahi dishes.  My only complaint (as with a lot of restaurants) is that it was really dim inside. Ah well, save a little of the electric bill I guess.",

Just batter fried shrimp with an orangish sauce on it that wasn't even spicy at all. Same sauce seemed to go on the Sriracha Pepper Chicken (crispy chicken tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce) that a friend ordered which again was not spicy in the least. I think the tacos would have been better had they a cole slaw mix instead of the lettuce. And mine seemed to be missing the sour cream which was ok since there was no spice to it & that would have made it even more bland. Tuesday & Thursday they have all sorts of Lobster deals & another friend ordered some of them & she said they were just ok. Not really sure I'll go back again with the way the food tasted. Would rather spend my $$ somewhere else.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to take our husbands out for dinner at Bonefish on a Saturday night.  Mini date night. :)  We were seated immediately at a nice tall top in the bar area.  Great ambiance and I have to say for the crowd they had not loud at all.   We ordered drinks and my friends who had gotten there a bit before us had already ordered Bang Bang Shrimp and I ordered crab cakes.  They bring out a nice fresh loaf of bread with olive oil for a nice light snack.  Our shrimp arrived and it was amazing!  Our crab cakes were amazing as well so full of crab and the sauce was a nice touch.   My hubs and I eat ordered the crab corn chowder and he ordered the steak while I went with their chicken as my friend was getting the other item I was eyeing, the tilapia.  The soup was so nummy, large chunks of crab through out the soup.  So GOOD!  Our main course arrives and it looks amazing.  Sadly, they overcooked my hubs' steak so he had to wait a bit.  The manager and the GM came over both to apologize which was quite thoughtful of them. My chicken had goat cheese and artichokes layered on it making it even better.  My green beans were smothered in butter which is not good for me but great for the hubs who ate them while waiting for his refire. :) I did taste my friends tilapia and it was a good choice as well.   Now to the reason I gave them only 4 and really debated on giving them a 3.  Our service was HORRIBLE.  My hubs orders his soda with no ice.  She brings it with ice and doesn't apologize when he mentions it to her. Does she correct it on his refill?  Nope!  I brought it up to her on the side and then she brings him seltzer water instead of his Sprite.  During the entire meal our water glasses were empty and I had to ask one of the servers who brought out our food to get another glass of wine. Let me explain, she had 4 tables she was working and I really wasn't paying attention to what kind of service they were getting but both my girlfriend and i kept commenting that we really never saw her with anyone else.    Will we be back?  Of course, the food was awesome.  I think our waitress may have had an off night but we did have quite a few misses during our visit.",

The food was excellent, and Danielle was really sweet and totally on top of things - she knew what we needed before we had to ask for it. I had the shrimp/scallops, my husband had the filet mignon. Both were absolutely delicious and expertly prepared. The prices are really fantastic, given the quality of the food and the service. There was plenty of parking, and you can get reservations online (so there's no waiting when you get there). Their happy hour drink deals are available in the dining room, and are really good. Overall, this place is highly recommended, and we will be back again (hopefully, we'll be in Danielle's section again!)",

Some busboy finally asks if anyone has helped us...and offered to get some water and iced tea.  So...not off to the best start.  When a waiter finally comes to talk to us we tell him we are ready to order...then he starts in explaining everything we don't care about and don't want or need to hear.  Then he apologizes saying they were having a shift change...really?!  Right in the middle of dinner rush hour...whatever.  So we order the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer, fish tacos, Salmon and a Caesar salad.  The appetizer shows up very quickly...and was pretty good...breaded deep fried shrimp in some type of good sauce.  About ten minutes pass and...the main courses arrive.  I casually mention that my salad never came and to please make sure I'm not charged for it.  Still not improving.  The tacos were good and served hot.  The Salmon was okay and served hot.  Frankly for a fresh fish house I was really expecting the salmon to be better than...say...any random cafe.  It was not.  It was on the lower side of average...kind of small and too dry.  The one saving grace for this place was that it was not too expensive.  We had a complimentary card for the appetizer, so the bill with tip was exactly $50.  I can think of literally a dozen other places $50 gets two people a better experience and food.  Considering we eat every dinner out, we get around a lot.  I can assure you Bonefish is off the list.  Maybe I'll forget all of this in a year or three and try again then.",

The server was pleasant but the food was very slow to come out. Mind you this is somewhat of an upscale place and prices are above average. A small two egg omelette with a little scoop of potatoes and three tiny slices of avocado finally came out. You could see more plate than food. No toast! When I asked a second time for toast, it did not come out until the meal was finished. I asked for grape jelly and she brought out strawberry. Bonefish grill had a restaurant in Henderson that closed. If this one does not get their act together, it may follow the same path. Never saw a manager to tell of my poor experience. Also the manager does not respond to negative reviews which makes things worse.",

Haha and he rocked it! Well done John and thank you Chris behind the bar for some yummy drinks! We have been here before for happy hour and the menu has gotten a lot smaller. For example they used to have their bang bang shrimp on happy hour but now they don't. Kind of a shame it was yummy. But you can still order it as it's on their regular menu. Anywho what we did have was pretty good. The boys had a couple wagu sliders, which they both really liked, then the cod sliders were also very tasty! The calamari was a little weak which was a shame because it looked good coming out of the kitchen with all the tentacles and rings but we liked the sauce!  And the mussels were slightly cold and so we sent them back and they nuked them and sent them back to the table. All in all this spot got a 4 star because of our great service! We had fun and the people next to us in the bar at a family style table were a hoot!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to the Bonefish Grill last night to celebrate his graduation. We made a reservation online, however when we arrived we were sat in the bar area and not the dining room... even though we had a reservation. Therefore, our server was the bartender who didn't come around to greet us or bring us water for about 20 minutes. It seemed like a semi busy night so we let it go. He eventually came over and we ordered a drink and the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer. The appetizer took another 20 minutes to come out, and BOY WAS IT DISAPPOINTING. I do not know how this is a signature menu item, in fact the thought of it makes me sick. Fried shrimp that is extremely overdressed with their overly creamy bang bang sauce. We then ordered our meal and sat there for 40 minutes without our server coming to check on us or to tell us that our food was on the way. In fact, several managers walked by us and never asked us how we were doing or reassured us that our food was coming. Honestly, we could have probably walked out without saying anything and no one would have even realized that we were gone. Our server, the bartender then returned to talk to us at 8:18 (mind you our reservation was made for 7:15) he told us he would check on our food. So we see him go to the kitchen and then he never came back to tell us anything about what he just went to check on, he just went back behind the bar and continued serving drinks. At this point my boyfriend and I were fed up, we just asked if we could pay for the appetizer and drinks because it was getting ridiculous by this point it is now 8:35, the appetizer was disgusting, and the service was extremely poor. Mind you, once again a manager never came over, she was hanging out with servers sipping on a coke and chatting. The bartender allowed us to leave without paying for anything even though we offered to pay for the drink and shrimp (that we didn't even eat because it was disgusting). No wonder this place has so many bad reviews!!! Businesses in Town Square often close when they are subpar, can't see this place being here in two years. Never again. ALSO - there are 3 other bad reviews just on this one day!!!! 05/13/18.. what horrible restaurant management.",

Before even pouring our first glasses, the server gave us attitude and mentioned that \"the minute that anyone becomes too intoxicated, this party will be shut down.\" Although I understand the reasoning behind the warning, it was extremely off-putting.  The next big red flag is that we arrived to a pre-set menu that no one was aware of - including the birthday girl who made the reservation. She had a large party but no one mentioned that she would be under contract with a set menu and price point. This made things extremely difficult at the end of brunch as it took us over an hour to pay and the price/gratuity (which wasn't even well-deserved) just kept increasing.  I've been to bonefish grill before brunch and warned my friend that they would likely \"run out\" of supplies for bottomless brunch. And just as I predicted, they did. 2 hours in and barely any of my friends had been served more than 2 drinks and they no longer had supplies for the mimomas or sangria. Why advertise bottomless if it is not so?   Overall, I will not be back. I paid $40 for a nonbottomless brunch and a brunch burger that was mediocre at best.",

Tried to hit up Helix for brunch, and though their website proudly advertises brunch, they have changed things up and this is now a lie.  Just sayin'.  But the hostess does redeem a few points by recommending Bonefish nearby.  Totally walkable, except it was 115 degrees that day.  As soon as we walked in, and said \"table for 3, please\", we kindly requested (read: desperately begged) for copious amounts of ice cold, fresh mimosas to quench our thirst (champagne is an obvious choice; no need for water).  Our server Melinda was a bundle of smiles and high energy, and tried her dandiest to keep on top of our glasses of bubbly.  Food was surprisingly tasty - someone in your party absolutely must order the creme brulee French toast with mascarpone whipped cream, it is phenomenal.  Cool vibe, and I always enjoy the community table concept.  If in the area again, will definitely consider this place!",

Drink orders took 15 minutes to arrive at the table. The server acknowledged and apologized that the bar was backed up. Then our food arrived immediately after. We were planning to have a second round of drinks but the slow service just kept us from placing any additional drink orders and the fact the food had already arrived and we were not going to chug down our drinks that fast. The Chilean Sea Bass Oscar Style was one of the best I have had. It tasted fresh and flavored very well. The potatoes au gratin were too cheesy for my taste. The California Omelet was average and did not stand out. I think the slow service at the start put a damper on our brunch outing and the attitude of the server rubbed off on us too, you know the one that reads, I don't want to be here.",

    "text": "I had the wonderful privilege of hosting a couple friends & family events in the new banquet room that Bonefish just opened,  the room was a perfect size to hold more then 50 people, I brought 25 people one night and over 30 people the following night, the food was fantastic and the service & staff were all on point. My entire party had a blast and thanked me over & over.  One of the unique things about the room was that the window walls opened up so at one point they opened them and u could feel a pleasant breeze thru out the room, I ordered the crab cakes, which were absolutely delicious and also got my favorite item the bang bang shrimp, defiantly come to this location and spend a perfect evening dining and if u want to host a large party this would be the spot!!",

Both were not friendly or welcoming. I'm a server and a low maintenance diner and I was compelled to write this review upon leaving. We actually wanted to leave after sitting there for 10 minutes with out any service while the table behind us who sat down shortly after us had drinks and bread from the same hostess that sat us. We stayed because we really wanted to try it out and optimistic that service would improve. Caitlin B served us and seemed to be friendlier to the other 2 tables she had. For this treatment I can not understand. She didn't say \" you're welcome\" when I said thank you and spoke very little to us, cold shouldered. The only reason I give this 2 stars is for Curtis who was quick to find assistance and was pleasant to interact with. Thank you Curtis.   So if you're looking for a positive and friendly dining experience, I can't recommend coming here.",

How can they be so great and so meh at the same time?  Now, I will always ask for the waitperson to make recommendations. That seems to be the way to go here. An insider's tip. And hopefully they will become more consistent, now that they are preparing to open one really close to our house.  Overall, we keep going back, the service is always A+, and the decor is comfy, not to loud and a great place to bring people for dinner.",

So we mostly get these three, very stable, and that's how I can say that their quality has been very consistent.  We always order our food well done. And they are able to wood fire grill our food (including steak, fish and burger) to well done without burning them. There is char, but not burnt. That's a very very admirable thing and please keep up the good work.   There was only one time so far that they made a mistake on our burgers, it was underdone (we wanted them well done). They humbly acknowledged the mistakes and fixed it for us. The manager would even come out to apologize and gave us a coupon for the bang bang shrimp as a gesture of apology. It was very professional and good work ethics. We didn't end up using the coupon because we are allergic to shrimp. But we admire and appreciate the gesture, so we keep going back after that mistake. Mistakes don't happen often anyway too, that was the only one mistake we experienced out of numerous visits.   I don't know if they age their steak, but I don't really care for those long aging taste anyway, and I don't feel that their steak is aged, I like the texture of the rib eye they offer, soft and tender, good quality.  The staff are all courteous and friendly. There was one particular young waiter that we really like. I think his name is Cameron according to the receipts. He is easy to make conversation with, and he gives good service and also very energetic and has good work ethics.   Please keep up the good work. I really like this restaurant. I like this one so much that I didn't even care about visiting the other location on Charleston as I want to keep having this good image of Bonefish by only coming to this one in town.",

It did take them awhile to get our food but I think it's because they were preparing all of food so everyone would get their food at the same time.

We were able to catch the brunch menu, but I wasn't feeling like breakfast food so I'm glad that had a couple of lunch options too.  To start we both had the blackberry sangria which was $12 for bottomless as an add on to the entrees. The flavor was very good, it honestly tasted just like juice to me which is typically a dangerous thing. For a meal I had the caesar salad with added shrimp. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the portion size of the salad was just right. I also enjoyed the complementary bread with oil that they give out in the beginning.   I'd defiantly love to come back here again to try more of their lunch and dinner options. I love the location and ambiance of the place.",

From the outside the place looked really nice and to get inside you have to go through the revolving door.   When you enter to the left is the dining area and to the right is the bar area with some seating as well. Since we had a party of 4 plus a baby we sat in the dining area.   The service was exceptional for the place being super busy. Our waitress was very attentive to us and even loved the baby. She made our experience great.   We got the bang bang shrimp to start and it was delicious. It was highly recommended on yelp which is why we choose to get it for appetizer. For our entrees we tried the lobster stuffed shrimp and the crab crusted Alaskan cod. Both dishes were delicious. Even the garlic whipped mashed potatoes and potatoes au gratin that my husband got was good. The spinach made my husband's mouth dry/itchy so it was hard to eat and the green beans needed some salt because they tasted bland. Other than that we had a great meal and even got a couple of drinks (Moscow mule & Manhattan).   I would recommend this place and would like to try their happy hour and its daily I think from 4-630!",

I usually order from their short list of specials to try what the chef has whipped up for the day.  The Miyosaki Sea Bass was the killer for the night that made the lobster tail look bad! The fish was marinated with misoyaki then grilled over oak. It has pickled ginger, sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and served with jasmine rice. All these flavors were splendid together.  And of course, there's their famous Bang Bang Shrimp that's how I started getting hooked with this place. Let me not forget their hand crafted martinis! I absolutely love the drinks here! The winter white cosmopolitan and the fall apple martini were an amazing drinks for the season before they disappear.  The service here is always impeccable! I love how it's a white coat service with fresh white chef coats that makes the environment extra special. The prices here are reasonable. They have awesome specials all the time like their Martini Monday or Bang Bang Shrimp $6 every Wednesday. Their offers online is also worth checking out. I can't wait to go back to see what's cooking on their specials for the day!",

For food I got the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict which was just okay. It definitely didn't live up to the hype.

Complimentary bread with pesto sauce was served first and it was decent, but the main dishes are what made us wish we had just stayed home. I ordered the Parmesan crusted trout with artichoke hearts, jasmine rice & veggies. The entire dish had zero flavor. The fish was bland & had two slivers of artichoke, the rice was literally just plain white rice with no flavor whatsoever, and the \"veggies\" was just a soggy bowl of spinach, again with zero flavor. My boyfriend ordered steak which was undercooked but okay, but the worst part was his side dish of au gratin potatoes. They were just chunks of potato with cheese sauce - it was almost shocking that they were serving this food in this nice looking restaurant. We can make way better food at home, and I guarantee you can too. Save your money, or eat somewhere else. Yikes!",

Our server was friendly but seemed a bit disorganized and confused. He may have been new. The real problem was the food.  The crispy bang bang shrimp which is our favorite was drowning in sauce, cold and soggy. Steaks were undercooked. The sea bass was caked with oily black carbon from a dirty grill. It tasted really bad. The expensive piece of fish was ruined. There was no time to have it replaced. Sad to say we won't be going back to a place that was one of our favorites.",

Lobster tail was okay. It could have been better. Not the freshest or tastiest - I've had worse. It was obvious it sat in the pass longer than it should have.  It arrived room temperature, not hot, but not cold either. It was served on the shell; I was able to manipulate it without burning my fingers on the shell. Mash wasn't great...again, room temp.  Bang Bang shrimp was ok. The sauce its tossed in is too creamy for the amount of batter these are fried in.   I've spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what it is about this place that doesn't sit well with me. I think I figured it out.   Atmosphere? Great Service? No complaints.  Food?  For a seafood place, the menu confuses me; it just seems heavy. Too much batter on the fish & chips & bang bang shrimp.  Too many \"fried\" options...and burgers, & I recall a steak?  During my last visit a plate was brought out to a nearby table. The smell alone made me ill. When I realized what it was I vowed not to come back. BROCCOLI by CHEF MIKE!!  You DO NOT MICROWAVE BROCCOLI.  You steam it, saute it, serve it raw but you never nuke it. Not only does it kill the nutrients but it stinks to high heaven. Seriously makes me wonder what is going on in the kitchen...in a Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares kind of way.   I know this review may read a bit bipolar, but Bonefish kinda is. I really wanted to like this place...I really did. Subpar food & confusing menu vs. Great atmosphere & nice staff. The broccoli though....killed it for me.",

It tasted good but not enough . The food is placed on your plate really nice and always looks so good when it comes out. The flavors are always wonderful.  I always order the lobster bisque soup no matter what. It is so good here.  For one of our lunches we ordered the hamburger. It has to be one of the best we have had in Vegas. You can taste the quality not some cheap greasy meat!! Its awesome! Another thing they serve before dinner is the bread. Oh wow me and my husband could not stop eating it. Its so good we could make a meal just out of that! lol Everything from the time you sit and eat to desserts are the best! It is almost like eating at a very expensive restaurant without the expensive prices!!  Usually we are too full to get desserts but this one time we had to try one our waitress recommended ~ it was the Creme brulee oh wow it is THE BEST!!! So creamy and the flavors just burst in your mouth! You will savor every mouthful! This place is so good!!! If you get a chance to try we highly recommend it! You will fall in love with the service and the food!  This location was clean which is a plus!!",

There are some really great pictures on here that make you want to try so many things, so being a Yelper of course I had to try!  Came on a Monday night with the whole family and we all really enjoyed our food!   So here's what we ordered: pecan parmesan crusted rainbow trout with coleslaw, and steamed broccoli. Not packed with a lot of flavor but still really good if your a lover of all fish, coleslaw was great and well, broccoli is broccoli. Fish and chips it was beer-battered and it came with fries. The fries and fish were both equally great. I had the ribeye and crab cake. My sides were garlic whipped potatoes and steamed asparagus. They had no gorgonzola butter so one of the gentleman made me a blue cheese butter and it was phenomenal!  The steak was cooked to perfection and the crab cakes was bomb! My kids had popcorn shrimp and chicken tenders and they loved both plates. We had raw oysters, Singapore calamari, ceviche, and bang bang shrimp! Every appetizer was awesome! The oysters are not very big but they are some of the best I have ever had! Service was good and all in all everything was great! Definitely will visit again to try something different!",

You get all you can drink (choose between Sangria, Mimosa, or Bellini) and brunch for only $20. Can't beat that! My vote is always for the Bellini, but you can easily try them all.   My favorite brunch option is the Bang Bang Shrimp Benedict, but anything with their Bang Bang Shrimp is amazing. The Bang Bang Shrimp isn't spicy but it has a really great small kick to it. Almost all of the options are worth trying. The Surf and Turf Benedict is probably my next favorite. If you are really hungry definitely go for the burger. Aside from the burger the dishes aren't huge, but they will likely fill you up, especially if you combine it with the bottomless bubbles. If you aren't a big drinker, their coffee is surprisingly good as well.

I had the California omelet which was probably one of the best omelets I have eaten.  My husband enjoyed the bottomless bubbles a little too much.  Service was fantastic!    We are using their event room for an event in January (which is why we came to sample brunch) and WOW!!  The room is very nice with floor to ceiling windows, seating for 55, a drop down projector & screen and a podium.  The room is no charge and they don't require a number count which is a great benefit since people don't know how to RSVP anymore.  They offer a brunch, lunch and dinner event menu.  Andy has been a pleasure to work with.",

This location is pretty busy, so I would highly recommend that you reserve a table ahead of time, otherwise you might end up waiting for 30 minutes.   After we were seated, the waiter came over to take the order. I ordered the steak and crab cake, with asparagus and mashed potatoes. My gf and her parents ordered salmon and sea bass. While we were waiting for our dinner we got their complimentary bread with olive oil and pesto dip. It was a great pseudo appetizer to meal that we were about to have. Approximately, 20 minutes later the dinner arrived. The steak and crab cake came with a lobster bisque sauce. The steak was good, however it wasn't perfect, it wasn't seasoned enough and the crab with lobster bisque sauce was bit to salty. Asparagus looked like it was heavily drenched in steroids; this thing had bigger muscles than me (Got to love genetically modified vegetables).  I tried my gf's salmon and it was pretty good. Seasoned properly with delicious lemon butter sauce.   Overall (3/5), good for chain restaurant, but you can do way better when it comes to seafood at other locations in LV.",

My meal: The mahi mahi with lobster sauce was great but served with mashed potatoes and a strange spaghetti squash ... Needless to say the mashed potatoes and the squash looked exactly the same. Not at all impressed by the presentation.   His meal: Amazing filet with colossal shrimp and the mashed thing again with the stringy squash.   Drinks: the mojito and the sangria left us no impression.. It was just a drink.  SERVICE: Our waiter never refilled our drinks and disappeared constantly. Took too long to take our order and get our food out. Never offered to upsell or recommend food, drinks, or dessert.  Not in a hurry to return and sit. May take out some protein.   I felt like I went for the big catch and ended up with nothing but the \"fish-bone\"",

She ordered the kids scrambled eggs with bacon and toast, and I ordered the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict with the au gratin potatoes.  Service was pretty decent and attentive.  However, when the food came out, both of our orders were incorrect.  Instead of the kids scrambled eggs, they gave her eggs benedict (which is not even on the kids menu), and gave me asparagus instead of the au gratin potatoes.  We ended up having to wait for my daughter's order, so obviously this wasn't a \"we just brought you the wrong plate\" kind of mistake, they totally didn't even do her order.  They brought my potatoes out right away, but I wasn't going to eat while my daughter was waiting for her meal. So I ended up eating cold eggs benedict, which I can tell is not very tastey.  To top it off, one of the eggs was only like half an egg, couldn't find the yolk.    I would also recommend that you tell the wait staff how toasted you like your english muffin for eggs benedict, because mine were hardly toasted - it was like eating straight out of the package.    I may be back again, but it's pretty iffy as there are much better restaurants in the area.",

We ordered the specials of the day for entree and although I failed to get the names of the fish that we sampled (there were three types), they were all excellent - moist, flavorful, perfectly cooked.   Despite the fact that I didn't like the texture of the brownie dessert, I feel that it is a personal preference so it is not the chef's fault. Overall, I had a great experience here!",

The best thing I tasted was my friends bang bang shrimp. Spicy and creamy, wish I ordered those instead!  The service was good but nothing was very memorable about the experience except 1 thing.  It was pouring the night we went and the hostesses had umbrellas in hand waiting to walk us out to our cars in the rain.

Mahi mahi (good! 8/10), with asparagus and the Mac and cheese (delicious....as all Mac and cheeses are...but I've had better) 2. Atlantic salmon (8/10), broccoli and mash potatoes  3. Basil pasta, cream pesto sauce with fresh chopped veggies (I would give it a 6/10, my friend thought it was a 10/10). 4. Special ahi ahi in wonton tacos (9/10), comes with a salad. Out of everything I would get this again  5. Teryake bowl (5/10), not bad...not good either  6. Bang bang shrimp (9/10) lots of crispy shrimp with a spicy cream sauce over it.   Staff is good when not busy, service goes down on the weekends.   Would I come again? Not for dinner, but I would like to try their happy hour!",

He was friendly enough but that's about where the positive ends.  - The server brought bread out to the tables after we were done eating our entrees - Food (everything!) was SO SALTY. I'm talking beyond what is normal for restaurants adding excess salt. My friend ordered steak and she was embarrassed that she had to send hers back because of how salty it was. They brought her another and it was just as bad.   - Prices a bit on the high side - SALTY!!!!! I know I said that already. I still can't get over it. Holy salt!!!!  - Lot of mistakes with entrees and sides. I ordered a side of steamed rice and got some weird cheese potatoes. Eugene took it back to the kitchen and brought me the correct rice right away, not sure if perhaps the mix-up was the kitchen's fault? Other people at my table also got wrong sides, or their entree orders were completely wrong.   - Servers made us pass steaming hot plates to the back of table instead of individually serving dishes to us. Huh? Who does that? Is this pure laziness, lack of training, or bad management?  It was my friend's birthday celebration so we tried not to moan and groan about the service too much...but sheesh!!! and one of our friends asked the waiter if he could bring out a special birthday dessert which  she offered to pay for, and they didn't even have a candle. I know this is a petty little thing.. but thought it was a little odd for a franchise restaurant like this to not have birthday candles?   Overall very unimpressed and disappointed with the food and service.",

    "text": "Stopped in with my co-workers this past week for lunch... the restaurant is clean, nicely laid out, and a convenient location for us as it is close to the office. When we arrived we were promptly seated, and our waiter approached to take our drink order, once we received our drinks we then ordered some appetizers to share... we started with the Cold Snap Fresh Ceviche and Thai Coconut Shrimp.  The ceviche was not that exciting to me, felt there was something missing from other ceviches I have had- but the coconut shrimp was delicious! For lunch I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai, I was very pleased with my selection.   I would recommend Bonefish Grill- they had decent lunch specials, and the food was good.  I wish that our service had been a lil better- our waiter seemed to be a bit sparce on the appearances even though the restaurant did not appear to be full. Once we ordered the appetizers our waiter did not return till after they were delivered by a food runner, he then proceeded to take out lunch order- just seemed to be a large gap of time in getting the appetizers after we ordered them followed by quite a time gap in actually getting to order out lunch.",

I don't usually do seafood, so I was thoroughly surprised and glad our food was suggested by our waiter.",

    "text": "Well it started out a bit awkward right off the bat, we had a bearded gentlemen as a server to start, we ask about the happy hour and he explains no happy hour food (his words exactly) but drinks this and that(not his words but not going to write you their drink specials either) , steps away to get some water for our table.   Another patron at my table had a question so naturally I ask the first person I see about whether or not a drink is a well drink, our bearded server comes back as the other guy who was nice enough to answer leaves.   Our server, yes the bearded short haired hot tempered guy gets offended immediately that we were talking to anyone other than him or the other server assigned to our group and says \"we are the only servers for you tonight don't talk to anyone else\"  Things are great so far yeah!?? Anyway we have our water he takes some drink orders and all is fine then he's back and taking dinner orders. Great! Food! 35 minutes or so and still no bread and we had to ask for it! Thank god for this gem named Sadie (sorry if I spelled it wrong) she sure turned the night around the best she could.  Though shortly before her timely and welcomed entrance to our lives he took some dinner orders and then forgot some others at the table, and I don't even think he put in any of the food orders until he got all the drink orders down (we all know they make their money on alcohol) so as more of our party gets here, the few of us in the first pack that didn't order wait until either he finishes taking all the drink orders or thankfully Sadie showed up.  She was quick to take the orders and get any drink orders he missed and was very polite, and she overheard us r alking about the bread we wanted and jumped right on it.  We arrived and settled into our seats (the first group) at around 6:30ish, we didn't get our food until around 7:40ish, as some people were late but some of us ordered well before people arrived but no one cares they just want their tips!  There was some immaturity with the bearded server nearly spilling oil on us and then slamming plates around but..  If nothing else the bearded guy was a disaster and Sadie was an Angel! She did the best she could under the circumstances and really made the night quite enjoyable!",

We had a variety of items starting with edamame and bang bang shrimp (very delicious). For dinner, they ordered red snapper, mahi mahi, salmon salad, fish and chips and I was the oddball and got the teriyaki chicken bowl. Everyone loved their food. The chicken was really tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet.   For dessert we all shared a flourless brownie and it was really good. The service was great and we really enjoyed our evening here. It's a nice place to go for dinner to get away from the hustle and bustle of the casinos.",

We always love going to Bonefish Grill and especially this location but I was so disappointed with the food and service today. I love the filet minion and lobster Benedict and I got it again today. Sadly, the center of the meat was completely raw. When I told the waitress, it felt like an inconvenience to her even though she did acknowledge that it was raw and all she did was say I will tell them to put it back on the grill. I was shocked that there was no apology and I was treated as more of inconvenience. I sadly do not think we will be returning to this location again.",

I understand restaurant business and have worked in hospitality, it's not really ok to shoo away a customer when your still open for 29 minutes right? Felt very un-welcomed and went around the corner to Yard House that is open much later. Also more welcoming. This is not the first time we tried to order (even to-go) trying to be considerate of their time, but it seems like they close at 9 and get everyone out as soon as they can. Hours should be changed if this is the case.",

Firstly if you are staying on the strip pick up a $5 Tix4d restaurant card kiosk that are all over or up the road from  as it will save you 20% here!  Food excellent, service excellent too.    Huge variety of items on the menu, Thursday is 50% off wine. Which makes a bottle of Malbec $14.50.  Our table ordered a mix of ahi, burger, steak. All perfect.  Salads and sides were excellent too.  The sourdough & pesto oil you are seated with is very good and especially good if you mix in some fresh lemon    All in all a new favorite when I am in town.    Fun fact. You are on the end of a runway across the road from the airport.  They restaurant has been well silenced but outside you can feel the landing planes every few minutes.",

Lunch was my calling on this day, and I must admit this is my second visit for lunch during the month.  Both days I visited the establishment the service and food were consistent.  The decor is what you would expect from a middle-high end chain in this restaurant group; however, some more detail to the seat in the booth I was sitting could be in order - large tear in the seat in booth by restroom.  All was clean and attended regularly otherwise.  The staff was friendly all the way around.  I ordered the salmon - if you read my other reviews you'll note that I'm a fish connoisseur at heart.  The taste was great and the side items, potatoes augratin, and broccoli were good too.  The tea was also good and fresh.  I was full for just under $30 quid/bucks/etc.   Not bad for Vegas!  Happy fooding!  Revision: My Dinner visit on this evening was less great than my lunch.  Water in a dirty glass, unacceptable - I'll drip the review a little for this poor dinner service and say that lunch is the best meal here.",

    "text": "Make this a Monday-Must for Happy Hour. All martinis on the menu are just $5 on Mondays and happy hour goes from 4-6:30pm- I tried their dirty martini and it was fab. I was pleasantly surprised with the blue cheese stuffed olives and a hint of pickle flavor, for the win! They have a bar specials menu with a variety of dishes from cod sliders, ahi poke to the yummy mussels, and if you have a child with you- they will even accommodate their happy hour menu in the dining room - I really appreciated that policy, not every business does that.  On our most recent visit, we started with their warm crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside house bread with garlic-herb pesto. Delicious! (side note: check my tip on the bread, just to be safe)  On to Bang! Bang! Shrimp & Ceviche. The B!B!S is a crowd favorite with fried shrimp, perfectly crisp, liberally tossed in a flavorful sweet and spicy sauce over a bed of lettuce. It's a good portion for sharing amongst friends and make sure to toss the lettuce in the dressing for a delicious little salad, to boot.  Not to be outdone, the ceviche of the day is a mixto of scallops, shrimp & sea bass, marinated in lots of lime, cucumber and avocado- served with tortilla strips. Ceviche was good, aside from large pieces of butternut squash that didn't mesh with the rest of the dish. I would request extra jalapeno if you're into spicy and ask for extra crispy strips; they were a little chewy and under-seasoned.  I had the Mussels Josephine from the bar bites menu. A good portion, plenty to make a dinner out of- with a delicious lemon butter broth underneath and tomatoes that paired perfectly with each bite of mussels. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite of succulent garlicy mussel with the diced tomatoes, it was a great mix. I wish I had saved my bread to sop up the broth, it was just super yummy.  Hubby had the filet with lobster, green beans and potatoes au gratin. Sides were all good. The cook on the steak was as requested (medium rare) but needed seasoning. We shared the lobster- it was cooked and presented nicely with side of grilled lemon and butter for dipping. Not mad about the lobster.  As for service, Nicole K. was a rockstar- some of the best service we've had dining out in a while. She was right on top of each detail, whether clearing plates, replacing utensils, fresh waters- next rounds of drinks, and even brought my son a special little dish of chocolate covered strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate chips in honor of his kinder-graduation.  As far as chains go, this one is my current favorite.",

    "text": "My husband and I tend to stick with our regular lunch/dinner spots and rarely try new places as we're often disappointed. However, after checking out the Bonefish Grill menu (with pictures) I was certainly enticed by all their seafood options and thrilled that they had a non-seafood appetizer I thought my Hubby would be interested in trying.   Last Saturday we decided to give it try for lunch. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and told we would be seated momentarily. It wasn't busy but the hostess needed to cleared off a booth for us.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by our server whose white shirt was a mish-mish of food stains~ not sure if he had been helping out in the kitchen or what. He was very polite and answered our questions although got confused when we were asking about portion sizes.   Since we had already checked out the menu on line we knew pretty much what we wanted to order: oysters, crab cakes and Wagyu beef potstickers for appetizers then a steak with garlic mashed potatoes & Truffle mac & cheese for my Hubby while I had Chilean sea bass with mango salsa, steamed broccoli and crab fried rice. Overall, everything was very enjoyable: my oysters came with fresh raw horseradish instead of the creamy sauce, the Chilean sea bass was perfect with the mango salsa and my Hubby's steak, although ordered well done, was not a dry charcoal briquette as it sometimes is when he orders is meat well done.  The only real disappointments were my Hubby's garlic mashed potatoes that just seemed to have an odd texture and my crab fried rice that just had shards of crab sprinkled on top. I don't think there was even a tablespoon of crab meat thought the dish.   During our meal I noticed several other tables with bread and dipping oil.. I was already too full but wondered why we were not given any. Later a friend informed me that you have to ask for bread otherwise it will not be served. Geez, since it was our first time you would think they would have asked?!! Anyways, you've been warned--ask if you want bread.   Will we be going back- ABSOLUTELY! And looking forward to it.",

They are exceptional at group events and I've seen it at several parties and meetings.  Bonefish is my go to place to dine.

    "text": "Bonefish Grill is Bang Bang Delicious  This review is for Bonefish Grill, 6527 Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89119, 702-407-0980, for a visit on July 22, 2017.  It's located in Town Square.  I first heard of this restaurant when I earned Reward Points through visits to Outback Steakhouse.  It is one of several restaurants where the discount Rewards coupon can be used.  I read a few reviews and decided to use my coupon there.  I attended the restaurant with my adult son Richard.  We entered the dining room at 6pm and were offered a table or booth.  We chose a table in the center of the room.  The ambiance was wonderful, carrying over the open yet rich interior design from the bar area, onto cloth covered tables.  I love that the restaurant has great lighting.  I hate eating in the dark or struggling to read a menu in minimal lighting.  Keep in mind it is summertime and the sun does not set until 8pm.  I imagine, after sunset, the restaurant probably offers a romantic lighting.  Upon being seated, our server \"Billy Balantine\" immediately brought us menus and filled our water glasses with cool water.  Water at the table is such a highlight in Vegas during the overheated summer, and I was glad to see that we did not have to order it or ask for it.  The menu was only one page front and back, plus a short Summer Specials menu on the table, but the offerings were more than adequate.  Most of the menu comprised of seafood delicacies including Chilean Sea Bass $30, Rainbow Trout $20, and Filet with Lobster special for only $22.  Keep in mind that this restaurant presents itself in an atmosphere of upper class gourmet yet the prices are only moderate. While we looked over the menu, our server \"Billy\" kept up a lively banter, answered all our questions about menu items and made several great suggestions.  The first item we ordered was the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer $12.  People raved about it online, so we had to try it.  \"Billy\" stated it was a customer favorite for which they received tons of orders.  Within minutes, literally minutes, \"Billy\" returned with our order and a plate of bread and oil dip.  The bread was a wonderful soft crusted sourdough with a side of garlic oil that was devoured so quickly by the two of us that we worried we might not have room left for dinner.  The Bang Bang Shrimp did not disappoint either.  We quickly gobbled that up too.  It had a wonderful flavor that was a little bit spicy and simply delicious.  I could have made a meal out two or three orders of just Bang Bang Shrimp and the delicious bread.  [Hint:  If you can't afford moderately priced restaurants for a full meal, I suggest going during Happy Hour, purchasing a couple of $5 drinks at the bar, carry them to your table, then order two Bang Bang Shrimp appetizers with bread, and really make it a meal.  It will only cost you about $40 for two people.]  For our main courses, my son chose the Chilean Sea Bass and had another Blueberry Lemon Drop $10.50 (tableside).  I had to try it.  The bass was so tender it fell apart in huge flakes of perfect white meat.  I took one bite before my son shooed me away, and it was a flavor burst in my mouth.  You could taste distinct flavors of seasoning and lemon, that seemed separate yet blended.  You could taste four different flavors along with the delicate fish' own flavor that was just exquisite.  I began to wish I had ordered the same item.  Instead, I had ordered the Rainbow Trout along with ice tea.  I'm a bit picky when it comes to trout.  I like it pan fried, but that was not an option,  Everything here is grilled, hence the name \"Bonefish Grill.\"  I still tried to get it the way I wanted.  I asked for the trout to be grilled hard on the skin side to crisp it, and also requested it blackened (meaning cajun spiced).  It seems these requests could not be filled, but the dish was stiull very good and a fair sized portion.  I recently had trout at \"Cracker Barrel\" and found it to be a bit slimy, flavorless, and the portion was one small side fillet about 2\" x 4\" in size.  Barely a mouthful or two.  The portion at \"Bonefish\" was two full fillet sides about 3\" x 5\" in size.  I only ate half and took the rest home for  a second meal later.  Both meals came with a selection of two sides.  We both chose the same sides: Garlic Whipped Potatoes ($4) and Crab Fried Rice ($6). The potatoes were so yummy and so was the rice.  Whoever heard of Crab Fried Rice?  It was a nice sized portion and so flavorful.  Just yummy!  The total bill was $88, minus our Rewards coupon for $20, and we were left with balance of $68 with our savings covering the whole tip for our excellent server.  My Ratings: Ambiance 5 star Service        5 star Food  5 star Overall  5 stars",

I specifically told not the isle or not near the kitchen or toilet. She kept looking around and I was able to count more than 10 tables.  I was already upset so I told her to forget it. She says \" let me see what I can do\" I told her you've done enough and walked away.",

The only thing I wish I could change was the amount of spicy sauce on the shrimp. It was way too much & smothered them. Next time, we'll get the sauce on the side because the shrimp are fried w/ a seasoning already. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu & offered great suggestions. My husband & I are major garlic lovers & the chef was willing to accommodate our request of adding garlic on our fish. Magnificent!  ; )",

Found out this is apart of Bloomin' Brands (Outback, Carrabba's, Fleming's & Roy's) and I'm a fan of the latter two, and who doesn't love Outback every once in awhile, so I excited to try this place. Immediately upon entering it reminded me of Outback with a Tommy Bahama feel. They have an awesome patio as well, it's that time of year for outside dining and I appreciate a good patio.  I started out with a glass of wine and I was surprised that had a decent wine list. The bread basket was a hit. Warm sourdough, butter and oil/pesto mix dipping sauce.   Their menu does change regionally, I noticed we don't have some of the fish on the menu as they do in Florida, but in change I noticed we do have menu items they didn't in Florida. They run nightly specials, and they have some drink specials as well. The Bang Bang shrimp happens to be my favorite menu item.",

I was happy to have this dining experience return after leaving the Henderson area a few years back.  Now with a new, easy-access location, and in the trendy Town Square area, Bonefish should please all that want to experience everything they have to offer.  You won't be disappointed with the diverse list of appetizers including their famous Bang Bang Shrimp with just the perfect amount of \"kick.\" Adult beverages are unique as well, with their Pineapple Martini being brought to my table many times throughout the evening.  If you order an entre, you're given a delicious bread plate that features a parmesan cheese bread with oil and fresh pesto...try not to fill up on this as you still need to make room for such items as jumbo sea scallops and shrimp with lemon butter, Chilean Sea Bass, chicken breast with goat cheese and sauteed spinach or their steak and Maryland Style Crab cakes.  Bonefish Grill does not feel like a chain restaurant. The decor provides a stylish setting that is both comfortable and open. The dining room is spacious and there is a large bar area with community tables.",

    "text": "Training Day Brunch  I got invited to a Friends & Family brunch service which was also a training day.  There were limited spots and my indicated time of 12:45pm was pushed back to 1:00pm when I called in to reserve my spot, which actually worked out better for my group & me.  I am  breaking this into sections since it is all still fresh in my mind:  Decor - It is a nice, contemporary look with lots of windows & great outdoor seating.  The bar has a nice feel while the bar itself being, nearly, the width of the restaurant.  The tables are covered with logo'ed, slightly course, tan paper.  I sat in a bar high-top so I only viewed the regular dining area.  BTW, the happy hour runs until 6:30pm, Sunday-Thursday with 5 or so food & 5 drink specials.  I didn't really pay too much attention since I am reviewing the brunch service.  Cocktails - I ordered Bloody Mary's & tried a sip from a Passionfruit Mimosa.  The Bloody Mary consisted of Absolut Citron muddled with fresh herbs & tomatoes & something that makes it spicy (horseradish + ???) Garnished with cucumber slice, olive stuffed with cream cheese, and celery stalk.  The overall flavor is freshness.  Not the sweet/Worcestershire tomato vodka combination that I am accustomed to.  A big plus, the muddled tomatoes & herbs hide the vodka bite.  The Passionfruit Mimosa was sweet & bubbly; during regular brunch, this is an \"endless\" drink, YMMV, though.  Appetizers - Though Michelle, our server, called the A la Carte items appetizers for today's brunch, we ordered a chocolate croissant.  It was very tasty with some type of maple glaze on top & dark chocolate within.  Appetizing, yes.  Appetizer, no; more like pre-dessert   Main Course - I ordered the Shrimp and Creamy Corn Cakes.  This was an outstanding dish with a good amount of spice for a Creole inspired dish.  The 6 large shrimp were served in their Creole sauce over 2 \"creamy cheesy corn cakes\".  These were lusciously fried with a light cheese & cornmeal sweetness.  A great platform on which to serve the shrimp.  This was a great dish and I would be hard pressed not to order it again instead of trying a new item. I sampled the potatoes au gratin.  For you potato & cheese lovers out there, we may have your new addiction.  I could have eaten this one item & been happy; very full, but happy, nonetheless.  Our server, Michelle was very fun & excited about the menu.  She had just gone through the tasting/training day and definitely was enthusiastic about many items.  I am excited about going back for dinner (Chilean Sea Bass in the Pan-Asian sauce).  The cost of our meal for 4 which was 4 entrees, 8 cocktails, and the \"appetizer' was around $100.  This seems a good price for the quality of food, which I would rate at 4/5 to 5/5 stars.    Warning, the overall flavors here are bold with mild (IMO) spiciness in many items. So, if you can't handle the heat, ask your server what's spicy & if they can turn in down a notch or 2.  Watch here for a dinner review, hopefully, soon!",

The manager had to bear the bad news that because the wine we ordered was so expensive thy only carried a couple of bottles and they had already sold out. Really? We chose another bottle. Just a note, we choose a wine for flavor not for price. They brought out bread/oil but not bread plates. We ordered an appetizer of mussels and stated we would share but it only came with one cocktail fork. Then our entree came and the temp of the food was warm but definitely not hot. The manager came and offered a complimentary dessert but we passed. He did comp the wine which we didn't feel was necessary. Our server was nice.

Wait staff was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the bang-bang shrimp benedict, a denver omelette, original eggs benedict and a salmon salad.  Oh, we also ordered calamari for an appetizer, more on that later.    For $11 the omelette was small, however the asparagus side was a nice touch.  This breakfast would leave anyone that was hungry, still hungry.  The potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were tasty although without the \"browned top\" you get when home made.  Both of the orders of eggs benedict came with undercooked eggs.  The bang-bang shrimp them selves were ok, however I hoped for an unusual flavor, but they were just spicy.  Since they appeared on the menu three times I expected a \"wow\" factor.  The salmon salad was a bit pricey but generous and pretty good.  Lastly, the calamari.  This of course was the first thing we tried, or tried to try.  They were overcooked and under flavored and hidden in a mass of lettuce and crispy noodles.  In retrospect we should have sent them back, they were that bad.  This is a seafood grill and they cannot get calamari cooked right? Come-on!",

No problem. Michael brought three different sauces on the side so we could choose our favorite. Then we tried Imperial Dip - also delicious. Next up was Caribbean Cobia which we had never had before.

    "text": "Solid restaurant in a great location offering delicious appetizers and entrees.  It's always great to have food options when venturing around Town Square and I'd gladly recommend this establishment.  Upon arrival for lunch, my family was seated immediately and they provide slings for infant seats which was nice.  We ordered:  Bang Bang Shrimp - Crispy fried shrimp tossed in a creamy and very mildly spicy sauce.  5/5, would get it again.  There was enough shrimp for at least two people.  My wife, who dislikes spicy food, enjoyed it.  Cup of Lobster Bisque - Not the best, not the worst.  A nice chunk of cooked lobster makes the soup worth it.  No bread or crackers are provided unless you ask the server for it.  Tilapia Imperial - Nicely sized baked tilapia with stuffed shrimp, crab, and scallops, tossed in a lemon butter and caper sauce.   The fish was perfectly cooked.  The lemon butter and capers gave it a delicious flavor.  The entree came with two sides of which we had two types of potatoes, both good.    Spicy Tuna bowl-  My only slight disappointment.  \"Premium\" sushi grade, sesame-seared rare, on top of jasmine rice, a half avocado, along with a sweet chili sauce and passion fruit salsa.  Compare my photo with that of the company's.  The tuna I had was very dark in color, not very fresh tasting, and the chili sauce just seemed out of place.  I'll give them a pass here as maybe raw fish is not their specialty.  The small slices left more to be desired.  Chicken tender kid's meal- Doubt you can do this wrong.  Came with a small drink and a side of fries.    Our server was okay.   Not super fast but she was able to be flagged down when we needed her.  Sometimes she forgot our requests for things like extra spoons or napkins.  Also, I'm not a fan of having to ask for bread for it to be served.  I would suggest having the servers at least offer it.  Once we asked, a generous loaf of bread came out with olive oil and basil.   All in all, a good business worth checking out a second time if not just to try their various wood-grilled fish options.  Stay away from the raw stuff and do ask for bread.  Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 5/100",

I should have taken the hint because unlike previous years the portion was smaller with only one piece of fish. Not very tasty and lots of batter. Even the price was higher than advertised. When I inquired they just comped the meal without an explanation. All I wanted was the advertised price. They embarrassed me and made me feel like I came in for a birthday free meal. I insisted they place it back on the bill at the over priced amount and I paid the full bill. I've been a customer of Bonefish in many locations for many years and tonight was disappointing and embarrassing. Sure wish a real manager was working instead of a wannabe who didn't have a grasp of what customer service is.",

As a vegan, I couldn't eat anything off the pre-set menu and had to basically beg before they would let me pay extra for something off the regular menu. They also didn't inform us of the \"contract\" at the time of the reservation so we were all caught off guard when it came time to pay- one person was left to foot the bill for 30+ people. The food was good but it wasn't nearly enough to make-up for the poor service and lack of preparation. They ran out of mimosas at BOTTOMLESS brunch and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience nor did they adjust our bill.",

    "text": "Our company had our annual Christmas party here and the venue was fantastic.  Thankfully the food was on par with the location and ambiance.  From start to finish, the quality and service were all excellent.  Started out with the Bang Bang Shrimp, easily one of the best shrimp appetizers I have ever had.  The sauce and flavor of the shrimp is just to die for.  Oddly, they give you a substantial serving of shrimp as well whereas most seafood places hold back on the portions to save money.  Kudos to Bonefish Grill for getting this one right.  I see why everybody starts their dinner with the Bang Bang Shrimp.  Had the dumplings as well and while they were good, I would probably try another appetizer due to the menu being pretty extensive.  For the entrees, my wife had the Tuna Steak and I had the Filet Mignon.  Both were excellent and we would order them again, however the huge surprise was the mashed potatoes that came as the side.  When you imagine mashed potatoes and how they should taste and how the texture should be, these were on point.  I look forward to the next visit to the Bonefish Grill to check out other items on the menu.  If they're anything like what I've already had, it won't disappoint.",

However, they have changed the lemon butter sauce to a much thicker and more buttery and less lemon sauce. It was really disappointing because I have eaten this dish at least 30 times. Even the severs agree that this is not as good as the original. I doubt anyone from Bonefish management reads these. They are becoming much more corporate Olive Garden style. Disappointing. I still come every other Tuesday because I know some of the servers and most are great. If it's not broke don't fix it !!!!",

    "text": "We came here for a date night dinner and honestly just had a horrible experience at Bonefish Grill. Not only was our server rude but unwilling to set forth any effort. We asked her if we could possibly have the trout prepared almandine style since we saw they had almonds in other parts of the menu but her response was that she had never heard of trout almandine and did not know what it was. So instead of asking the chef if it was possible to accommodate our request she just said no we could not order that. I had the lobster which arrived completely cold and when I asked our server for a side of lemon butter her answer was that my order did not come with lemon butter. She must have read my mind by look on my face because she conceded and brought it out. My zucchini and squash were completely overcooked and the broccoli I chose as my side was mostly yellow instead of green and was part mush and part rock hard raw broccoli. I ordered the Arnold Palmer iced tea and quite frankly the Snapple Arnold Palmer I get from a bottle tastes better than this. The restaurant manager looked lost just walking around the restaurant and did not stop at any of the tables to speak to anyone. When he saw that I was trying to get his attention he looked away and kept right on walking. You can tell he was not interested in speaking with anyone and trying to avoid any confrontation. If our experience is an indicator of others experiences maybe he's just tired of listening to complaints and not interested in changing any of the problems. What a waste of money, time and a date night. Will definitely not be back.",

We said no and then she said, \"so you're a walk in?\"  My husband, being funny, said\" well we drove.\"  The hostess didn't get it.  She took us into the bar to be seated.  She never asked if the bar was okay.  Don't you normally sit in the bar if you don't want to wait for seating?  The entire restaurant was empty except for 2 tables and there was 1 other couple in the bar.  I have no idea why we had to sit in the bar.  My husband asked but he was ignored.  We didn't really make a big deal of it because it was our anniversary (30th) and we didn't want the evening to get weird.  So after that we ordered but the food was just okay.  The soup wasn't hot and the entrees were decent but not excellent.  The service was also mediocre.  Our server was there to bring the food but that was it.  The rest of the time, he and the other 4 servers were gathered around a tv in the bar watching football.  At one point, he even walked out the front door and was outside for awhile.  The bar music was blaring.  I guess for the prices, which I think are somewhat high for the food you're getting, I would expect better service and better ambiance.  We'd been there before and sat in the restaurant and the food seemed pretty good, but then again we had an attentive happy server and we were in the restaurant.   We won't be going back.  Our breakfast at the Coffee Pub the next day was a far better experience and what we'll remember for our 30th anniversary celebration.",

The food was okay, I loved the Bang Bang Shrimp but the crab cakes were almost too salty to eat. The bread was good but the seasoning mixture for the dipping oil was not to my liking. I will not return. The folks at the next table ordered a tilapia and were served trout and it seemed like the server was trying to convince them that they were mistaken. We were aware of all of this because the server was an inch from our table while the conversation was going on. It was loud, cramped and the food was not worth trying again.",

The side of veggies were corn, beans and I don't even remember. It didn't pair with the dish well.   My husband got the salmon or halibut. I don't remember. He said he liked his dish. Also got the bang bang shrimp as appetizer and that was good. They had a happy hour or sale on that app. I also had the corn chowder soup which was delicious. Lead me to believe my entree was going to be good.   We were celebrating two birthday celebrants and they don't do candles or singing here. The ambience was low lighting and small space. It made the birthday boring! Food was boring, place was boring, service was boring!   We ordered dessert for the birthday celebrants. We got the flatbread sangria thing and that was just disgusting. $12 for that flatbread. That just needs to be taken off the menu. We also ordered creme brulee and brownies with ice cream for the kids.  I think those were good according to the kids. Guess you can't mess those up.   My cousin in-law and myself left hungry. Overly priced for sucky food. They should consider serving a starch, some bread or something with their expensive small ok entree.   You'll probably get more bang for your buck and tastier meals at King's Fish.",

    "text": "Been here many times and always enjoy my food! My service today was terrible we were the first table today party of 7 for birthday brunch our server was not attentive and I was constantly asking other servers for drinks and other items. I let the manager know at the end of our meal while waiting 20 mins for our check about our experience and she did nothing said I'm so sorry I'll talk to the server. Then to top it off we made it stupid proof with one bill for 7 people wrote down the last 4 digits of the cards and amounts had 2 gifts cards and cash. Our server did not bring back a receipt and to the left over cash as a tip! You always bring the cash back and let us leave the tip!!! That's was ridiculous I had to ask for a receipt and although our service was terrible most of the party works in the serving industry and would have tipped 20% percent but since she helped herself to 19.00 on a 170.00 check we didn't feel the need to leave any more. I felt like at the very least the manager could've comped the desert since it was a birthday brunch. We told the server before hand and let her know she wanted the donuts. Her desert came out no candle no one sang overall a terrible experience and I will not be dining here anymore. By the managers response my service is not needed.",

For the price is the place you would expect it to have quality food and clean atmosphere, but it was not for me. Maybe it was just a bad day? Who knows but I walked in and used the restroom while waiting for my colleague, there were two bathroom stall, one was plug and the other one wasn't but there was one roll of toilet paper that was out and one that was about to be out. The floor was littered with dust and small paper debris. This was at 12 in the afternoon, there were many staff members standing around, since there was only about three tables I would expect them to try to clean the place a little bit. Skip to the food, it was not very good for the price and even if it was a little cheaper I would have still thought it was bad. The service was actually good, our waiter was very nice so it wasn't his fault that the place was dirty and the food was bad. I went back to the bathroom an hour later and it was still Not cleaned. Needless to say I won't be coming back. Cleanliness in a restaurant should be very important to the owner.",

When you walk in, you'll notice a nice dimly lit restaurant and the wait staff well dressed and uniform.   We went the week of Christmas and I got the Lobster Thermidor Dorado. I finished my plate as I usually do when I dine here.  I suggest the Bang Bang Shrimp or the Singapore Calamari for appetizers.  For main entrees, you basically select the fish/seafood you would like and then you select the sauce it's cooked in. My favorite is probably the Sea Scallops with Mango Salsa. The four choices are: Mango Salsa, Chimichurri Sauce, Lemon Butter, and Pan Asian.   This is a great place with reasonable prices (under $20 for most entrees). If you like Carrabbas, Outback, Roy's or Flemings and you enjoy fresh seafood - this is a must try.   5 Stars for service. 5 Stars for the Quality vs Price of the food. This is much better than most chain restaurants but it's not fine dining.",

Had the cobb salad and the swordfish special with bacon and spinach. The dressing on this salad was just terrible. It was okay on its own, but combined with the rest of the salad the flavors just did not work well together at all. The swordfish was \"eh\", the bacon and spinach were a disappointment. I have high expectations of bacon. The spinach had a poor texture and flavor.",

To be honest, the $90 total bill was not nearly worth the signature dishes (denoted by the starfish).  In fact, the only real reason why we came back was to exchange an audio interface at Guitar Center.  Otherwise, it's called Bonefish grill but lacks a wide variety of fish dishes, what gives.  The two and a half stars (rounded up) equates to a meal that you can make at home imo.  Good thing is that there are tons of options around if you are looking for the upscale chain (Texas d Brazil, Yardhouse, etc.).",

Once I sat down, it was nearly impossible to get a drink order in since all had already done so. Finally when we ordered din, I got a drink too. Our table had two waiters, which was confusing. You'd think by having two we'd have prompt service. Not the case. Wrong order, app brought out early when it was asked to be an entree, again took for ever to get my second drink... Oh and my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else's even though we ordered together. We asked twice about it... Then it popped up. They offered to spilt our checks, which was nice (we were prepared to pay cash). And when we got out checks, half were messed up. Then one of the waiters accused two of us for not paying for our drinks... When we explained they were on others tabs and we straightened it out, he never apologized. I realize group outings can be difficult for restaurants but we were a considerably easy table with a lot of blunders. Service, 2 stars (with the exception of the initial greeter/manager?)  I ordered the red sangria which was great! Tastes like grape juice, much sweeter than your average sangria. So may be a no-go for some. And the baja fish tacos with chips. A fresh mango salsa topping the tacos was definitely above par! My food was a solid 4.5 stars.   I'll return but most likely will hit the bar area.",

Will not be going back. Bonefish, it's time to join the 21st century. It's called WI-FI.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",

    "text": "After hearing so much about this place, we finally had a chance to visit for and early Valentines Day date night. The reason I rated a 2-star was because of the sodium content in both entrees. It was incredibly salty almost unbearable. I should have made a complaint but we were having such a romantic moment that I just could ruin it. We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and the Filet with lobster stuffed shrimp. The sea bass was flavorful but salty. Don't order the filet with lobster stuff shrimp, you will be disappointed. The shrimp were small (you would think for a fish house they would serve jumbo tiger shrimp) and there was disappointing portions of lobster meat. The fact is that the shrimp were too small to stuff with lobster meat. Too bad for me as I was really looking forward to it. The filet was cooked just right (Melted in my mouth) but the masala sauce was way too salty and the mash potato was unbearably salty that I didn't even eat it. I hope this was an oversight or there was a cook in training because someone didn't check the spice portions or taste the food. Needless to say, there were some bright spots. The appetizer, Bang Bang Shrimp was amazing. I should have ordered two servings and I would have been completely satisfied. Served on a bed of spring mix, the spice, pea nutty sauce was simple delicious. The chopstick were a plus as a utensil. The bread was to die for...with the garlic infuse olive oil and pesto based spices. Lastly, the chocolate Creme Brule was yummy. If you want a private space, ask the host don't settle for other tables as they are extremely close. Without a good experience with appetizer, bread, dessert and my hot date (wife), I would have given it a 1-star.",

The gentleman sitting to the left of us received his burger, complained about it being \"medium instead of medium rare\", and had it replaced by the time we got our Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer.  The couple to the right of us (who were seated after us) had their appetizers and was finishing up their main course by the time i got my side salad. This is when i started to get impatient. I mean, its AHI TUNA! Its seared! Not even cooked all the way!!  After awhile, we had decided to pay for our tab and leave. I asked the hostess for the check and the manager came out, apologized and was nice enough to covered our bang bang shrimp and side salad.  I was a waitress before so i do understand things get backed up and was going to try Bonefish another day....  BUT when i went to the table to leave a tip, our waiter went to K.L and said \"its only been 18 mins since your salad came out\". WHAT?!?! We have been seated for over 40 mins and all we got was an appetizer and a side salad!",

Even better is when we make it to Bonefish Grill for their awesome Happy Hour, and Bang Bang Shrimp is just $6.  I contemplated the well drinks, but chose a Cadillac Margarita, and was rewarded with a good dollop of Grand Marnier floating amid the tequila.  My honey ordered the Wagyu Beef Sliders, four perfect petite burgers, and slid them down with a delightful lemonade.  We sat at the bar, since Happy Hour was just winding down, and had some of the best, most individualized service we have ever had in Vegas by a very professional bartender.  We did notice that he was on top of things at the bar, as well as seeing that everyone received their preferred order.   This is a must stop for each and every Vegas trip!",

Decided to switch it up and BRUNCH for this birthday this year. I made a reservation for about twenty, requesting the long tables in the bar.  GREAT SUCCESS! We had two servers to handle our crowd and basically brunched from open til they stopped pouring!  Okay so I was looking at the menu and didn't see many vegan friendly items on the menu and i was gonna be draaaaankin' so i definitely had to find SOMETHING. I already knew I could have the house salad, hold the cheese but I needed something MORE.  I did ask our server what, if any, were vegan friendly items on the menu. He really didn't give me an answer and I was super annoyed by it but i glanced over the menu some more and they have several side items you could order and probably be vegan but honestly I ended up just ordering the small salad and some french fries and ate some edamame and then just kept drankin'!   Our two servers kept me and my peeps full of alcohol and food so by the time brunch was over I was a happy camper.",

    "text": "The food is always really delicious at Bonefish Grill. My two favorite things to order is the Imperial Cod. The cod is always cooked to perfection. The buttery lemon sauce definitely compliments it. The shrimp and scallops on top is okay. It just kind of sits on top. It wouldn't make a difference to me if there was any on it or not. For the first time, I tried their Brussels sprouts and they were delicious! I could finish a whole thing of those! I would definitely pick those as a side. You get two sides with your meal. I wish that you can just have one specialty side without having to pay extra instead of the two. I definitely need to come here more often to comment about the other dishes but I definitely recommend the cod and their Brussels sprouts. I also enjoyed their crab cakes too!   Service is a little lacking. My boyfriends mom asked for lemon with her water. It took the waitress maybe 10 mins to get her lemon. She rarely checked on us. Other than the service, this place is great!",

    "text": "So after having our weekend plans cancel suddenly last minute my honey and I decided on Bonefish since we had just received a BOGO in the mail.  So first off, we came in and asked for a table for two. They took us to the high top tables at the bar that are so super close to each other that you are practically sitting on your neighbors lap. That may be ok if you are at happy hour and open to mingling and doing a little networking. Or even if there is a long wait for the dining room and you are just famished that you just don't care. Totally not appropriate for a Saturday night date with my man. When we asked the hostess if there was another spot we kind of expected her to have to check first. Nope. She knew right where to take us. It's as if she was coached to take us to the uncomfortable bar table first to see if we would just settle first. Not cool!  Now I will say our server (I believe his name was Justin) was awesome. He was on top of it and helped us navigate through the menu. I settled if the the crab crusted cod. It was just kinda meh. I sucked it up because it wasn't bad. It just wasn't tasty either. My boyfriend got the trout which he hated. It was extremely oily/greasy to the point where he had to send it back and order something else. We both had the bacon Mac and cheese which was mind blowing. Put a cape on that dish because it literally saved our dining experience. Now thumbs up to the manager (Shelley?) for coming over and addressing our dissatisfaction with the trout. She was great and extremely professional.  Because of the great service by our waiter, the attentiveness of the manager and the bombalicious Mac n cheese, I will probably give it another shot but most likely just for happy hour drinks and appetizers.",

Brunch on a Sunday when we didn't have a reservation, waiting is expected. However, we maybe waited for three minutes before something was available.  Right away, they're off to a great start with $10 bottomless mimosas! You can choose between regular orange juice, mango, or peach bellinis. I tried the peach and mango, my boyfriend tried all three. Peach was definitely the winner for us!  We started with the ahi tuna sashimi and then shared an Oscar omelette with a side of spinach and the filet mignon and lobster eggs Benedict with a side of bacon. The bacon wasn't even extra to have as your side- major points!!  All of the dishes were fantastic. I was surprised and very happy the lobster and steak were cooked so well during a busy brunch time. The steak came out slightly less than medium just the way a good breakfast steak should. My favorite was the ahi tuna on the bed of lettuce. It had a ginger dressing and a slightly punch sauce drizzled on the plate. Delicious!  Benjamin was our server. He was awesome! Super nice and attentive even when clearly busy. Our mimosas were never allowed to go empty and refills came out quick. He was on it!  I've never been in for dinner but would like to check it out. At the very least, we'll definitely be back for brunch!",

It is understandable that a big group like our table we would have to wait a bit for our drinks; however, 20-30 minutes for drinks are unacceptable for an upscale restaurant. In addition, we ordered a well done burger with a few special requests, and the burger came out medium rare. The server was kind enough to remake the burger for us. The second burger came out well done but did not make with our special requests. I was extremely disappointed at the service that how slow it was for an upscale restaurant. I would highly recommend management to take a closer look into either scheduling or proper training to provide more efficient service in the future.",

It was a lovely treat for brunch with Grand Marnier battered bread with berries and whipped cream on top. He loved it! You can choose bottomless drinks with brunch. It includes Peach Bellini, Mango Mimosa, Tradition Mimosa, Bonefish Aperol Spritz, Bloody Mary, Blackberry Sangria, and Cucumber Spa Spritz. My friends really loved the drinks. This location is in Town Square, so it's nice to walk around after to walk off your brunch.",

    "text": "We decided to come here to celebrate my boyfriends new job. I've always heard good things about this place but thought it would be to high end or extremely expensive. Best decision, the food was incredible and super tasty. Reasonably priced for the impeccable quality and quantity.  First and foremost the complimentary bread and olive oil/garlic/pesto/ goodness was absolutely delicious! Keto and low carb dieters, this is hazardous but totally worth it! We had the waygu beef and ginger potstickers for appetizers. Now I'll admit it was maybe just the soy sauce used but it was a little on the salty side but overall incredible. Great flavors that just complimented wash other.  I indulged in a 6oz filet and lobster tail (he got a new job that's a huge raise, so don't blame me lol). Meat was cooked perfect and melted like butter to the lips. Lobster was steamed to perfection and they have a little candle stand that keeps the butter nice and melted.  So when you order an entree is comes with two of the signature sides so I got the potatoes au gratin and upgraded to a premium side for an extra $5 charge, Brussel sprouts with ham. Guys, even if you're not a fan of brussel sprouts, give it a taste! Very delicious and at least worth a try. You'll be upset when you didn't order it.  My boyfriend got the Chilean Sea Bass with Potatoes au gratin and the seasonal vegetables (blah, broccoli) but he ate it up and left no traces if there was any food on the plate.  Because I called in a reservation prior, I was asked if we were celebrating anything special, I told the girl that my boyfriend was starting a new job. So at the end of our meal, we were asked if we would like dessert and granted that's my favorite part but honestly I was so stuffed with all the goodness before that I couldn't even look. But I read the dessert options and they all looked pretty delicious especially the macadamia but brownie one! But we declined and our server Tori brought him a \"Bonefish Grill box\" and inside were little chocolates. It was there congratulations gift.   I thought it was the sweetest thing!....get it? ....  ok, moving on, the server Tori was amazing and made our first visit into a definite repeat visit.",

I enjoyed my shrimp and scallops. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the shrimp was overcooked and had far too much rub. Also, they leave the tails on which can get messy trying to get the meat out of the tail.  The fish and chips my kid had were a bit gummy but with good flavor inside.  The bread was not bad but not great either.    The service was excellent. Friendly and they managed to stay on top of our drinks.  Definitely a good place to go in Town Square.",

We had a set menu that was served in a timely manner once our drink orders were taken. Of course it was loud, crowded, and a bit hectic. But the drinks, food, and attitude  of the staff was all very up to par. The food was hot, flavorful, and served in with a smile.  The time before was for a birthday party of about 10 people. We did have a reservation so that was helpful. Service was helpful with questions about the menu. Food was served all at once so no one in our party had to wait. Splitting the bill was easy and quick. This place can get packed: date night, happy hour, celebrations, etc. So be ready to get snuggly with the people at the table next to you.  Lots to choose from as far as: apps, soups, salads, tacos, fish, and desserts.",

The shrimp for me was spicy, but not too spicy while the scallops were okay but chewy, as if it was overcooked. The waiter gave us little alcohol cups for our water which were dirty and stained when he brought us it. When we asked for a replacement, the 2nd pair was dirty as well. An hour or so later we both had to throw up. It was undecided whether it was due to the dirty water cups or the oddly tasting food.  Won't ever be coming here again.   TLDR: check your water cups and thoroughness of the food when you get it, or better yet, don't go at all.",

I reserved our spot with 1 hr time frame to get ready and head out so that we weren't rushing. They also have text reminders to let you know when your table reservation is ready. Unfortunately even though we were right on time, we still had to wait an additional 30 min to be seated or get a response from a text message. The waiting area was cramped full of hungry people lol. Other than the waiting, my server had utmost unmatched guest service for us throughout our dinner. I apologize for not remembering her name but I left a generous tip for her.   I love the layout of the area. They kept it old school with a revolving entrance door facing a rustic gatsby style bar. Our dining experience was a candle light dinner for the romantic intimacy. They covered the tables with white sheets and disposable paper - I guess it's for the easy cleaning after each brutal food slaughting experience.   To get you prepared in advanced, expect to pay around $100 for the full course dishes from appetizers to dessert. We both started with their famous bang bang shrimp  which was super delicious! I want more!! Then we went straight for the specialties! I had the \"catch of the day\" Mahi Mahi with asparagus, creamy smashed potato, broccoli.  My other half got the lobster stuffed shrimp and fried rice!   I will tell you this!! I will definitely come back for the bang bang shrimp! We skipped the dessert because our course dishes were so filling. For a plate that didn't look big and full, it sure made my stomach full. I guess it was all that bread and pesto from the start lol   Gents, take your partners here and you will get her to want you for dessert later on",

To be honest, the only thing that I disliked was the price point.   First of all, the service was GREAT. We barely noticed that the drinks and food were coming out slowly because our server was so helpful and attentive. We even took a while to decide on what to get and he never rushed us.   The drinks were pretty delicious and a good amount for the price. We had the grapefruit margarita, a sangria (I don't remember which one), and a white cranberry cosmo. The cosmo was too strong for my friend's taste so our server kindly brought us white cranberry juice to mix.   I won't bore you with every single detail of the food. Let's just say that you definitely need to get the bang bang shrimp. So worth it. The highlight of the food for me was that their portion sizes were perfect (read: not 10 servings on one plate) and the seafood was cooked amazingly as well. It's easy to overcook seafood but everything was tender and of good quality (firm, turgid meat).   The price is a little steep but I think we were just unprepared for the epicness so my friends and I will definitely return once we're ballin'. You do get what you pay for.   -1 star because my boyfriend got sick right after eating there. (He's still excited to go back anyway.)",

My husband is a chef and to be honest no server should be in a chef coat. Those coats are earned not just worn. And to those in on the business it can be an insult.

The service, food, and atmosphere were all top notch. I would even push my review to 4 1/2 stars.    TIP: Wednesdays at Bonefish is $5 bang bang shrimp= ALL NIGHT.  Also, they have a great happy hour menu (see pic) that runs 4:00pm - 6:30pm Sun- Thurs.",

Nonetheless, food was consistent with other Bonefish locations. The baja shrimp tacos are a must. I hadn't been in several years and decided to switch it up. Instant regret. I also tried a new drink, Paloma, which was too sweet for my taste.  I am curious if the B team does the lunch service and maybe dinner is the way to go.",

Most of us tried their brunch special which consists of bottomless \"brunch\" cocktails i.e. mimosas, bellini's, etc. along with an item of the special brunch menu for $19.99.   The restaurant itself is very nice and clean with an \"I'm on vacation on the waterfront\" vibe. The service was fantastic. Our server was on point with cocktails, food and overall very pleasant.   I ordered the Bang Bang shrimp Benedict with side of asparagus. The Benedict was very good, crispy shrimp and a flavorful with hint of spice sauce. The asparagus were meh. They seemed overlooked and a bit soggy. Had the price not included bottomless brunch beverages I would've given the review 3 stars because how difficult is it to get asparagus right? But keeping in mind what you get for the price, the overall atmosphere and service the experience did deserve 4 stars.",

He looked about 14, however I am sure he was over 21, just not a good fit for this group of gals. I do remember his name, however I am not going to call him out, I usually think it's a training issue & o think this was the case here too!  He spoke quite fast & in a quiet tone.... I had to laugh as he finished speaking one of the gals commented she was gonna have some chicken dish, to which he replied \"we don't have any rice cooked\"  to which I whispered to her, put some water in a pan, heat to a boil etc. etc. anyway..... As we ordered he did say, they now can prepare her earlier request!!!! So she did have the chicken dish WITH RICE! The orders came out at the same time, however there were some mix ups ~ the good news was he had another server assisting him and she kinda took control. I did notice they put in the orders with hand held computers (which I hadn't noticed happening before) so this could have aided in the confusion~     Bone Fish is noted for the Bang Bang Shrimp! Usually OUTTA SITE! However my order was kinda like lightly deep fried without much sauce  and no I didn't send it back, there was already confusion & I didn't feel like adding to it plus it was fine, just not what it could have been~ My house salad was very ample with lots of good things on it, plus the balsamic dressing was excellent. My salad on my last visit, a Caesar was drenched in dressing.....not a good thing atleast for me....but the BANG BANG SHRIMP was DEVINE on that visit!!!!!    On the positive side my red wine sangria was very good, as usual~",

Although the manager was super nice and gave us 2 free bang bang Shrimp. We had to wait 40mins for a table. Since it was 7 total. 3 children, 3 and under made this a tiresome 40min wait.   The steak I ordered, medium rare -was served rare.   Our drinks weren't bought out at the same and the waiter had to be reminded of the drink order for our friends and husbands side of orange juice.   Bang bang shrimp is scrumptious. So is the crab fried rice, mashed potatoes, & truffle mac and cheese.  Cranberry cosmo (special) was also delicious.   Overall I think we will need to visit again to really decide. I feel like it was off night for the restaurant. Till then my rating stands.",

I would say so much staff that you would think that we would get five star service. There were cooks walking around there were people in street clothes walking out of the kitchen the manager was walking around and we still waited at least seven minutes before somebody came and took our order. It was so bizarre all of the staff walking back and forth and back and forth it was completely weird. I get it we were there early and they were probably preparing for their night but honestly it was so uncomfortable eating with so many people walking past the booth past the booth.  The food was what you would expect from a chain the filet had absolutely no flavor. We are locals we had a gift card and we will not return,",

Never recieved a call. So I walked in at 8:10 pm. There was a lady standing at a small free standing table a little away from the bar. She was dressed like a chef like the rest. I attempted to ask her about pick up and she rushed off without acknowledgement. I looked around and there was a desk deep in the corner with no one at it. (Behind the corner). I waited for the lady to come back and 15 mins went by with no one coming back to either wait area. Then several staffed walked back and forth without offering assistance. My mother called their phone number asking for corporate and/or regional managements number. (Of course the lady wouldn't give it). She then came from the back and asked whats wrong? I proceeded to explain. She cut me off and said she would get a manager and check on the food. The manager came out with an attitude. And he said, \"so what's wrong?\". I explained to him the same story. Then he said he would get our food. He came back about 2-3 mins later with it and said, \"here\". My mom was still willing to pay. However he did say he took care of it. However while saying that he rolled his eyes and rushed off. His staff scattered back to what they were doing walking back and forth ignoring patrons with their attitudes. I will NEVER eat here. Also the wait had our food cold and soggy. Disgusting. Threw it away!!! Don't waste your time. Just go somwhere else!",

Despite the restaurant being very empty, for some reason I did not get my food until a couple minutes after the rest of our table.  My friend ordered fish and chips with vinegar but the vinegar did not come out with the food, and the waitress did not check on us so he was stuck nibbling on fries for 5 minutes until he could flag her down.  Food - I ordered the rockfish with a pesto sauce on it, and broccoli as the side.  The fish was slightly larger than a goldfish, and came with 5 or 6 small broccoli florets.  The portions were definitely too small and most of my plate was empty.  Normally I couldn't care less about presentation but a plate that was 75% empty space really left me wanting more.  The broccoli was delicious, but that's the only part I enjoyed.  If I had boiled a piece of chicken breast in plain water it would've had more flavor than their rockfish.  I don't plan on going back.  The place isn't horrible or disgusting, but it's not the cheapest and since it is in Town Square it is surrounded by a half dozen places I would prefer to eat at next time.",

I love great service and our waitress came back to ask how we were doing a few times, water was refilled very quickly, and we were asked more than once if the food was good.  The food was presented very well and was rather tasty, but much too salty for my taste.  Additionally, avoid the \"white sauce\"...it's super fattening and salty. Urg.  Besides that, the shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good.  The bacon-wrapped scallops were amazing. We enjoyed the appetizers a bit more than the main entrees so keep that in mind when ordering as it's likely you'll experience the same!  Side note - I left my credit card there! I only noticed the next day when I was leaving to come back home as I was at the gas station about to pay for gas! I called them immediately to see if they had it and as sure as Dahmer is burning in hell getting gang-raped by strap-on-wearing lesbians, they had it at the front desk waiting for me!  Great service, awesome dining experience.  Food could be a bit better~  ---Overall---  Service: A+.  Awesome~  Food: B.  Salty, secretly fattening, but damn good~  Atmosphere: A. Very cozy, intimate atmosphere.  Great for date night",

    "text": "Writing this review was tough. I want to like, even love this place but I just can't seem to get over the unpleasant experience we had. Lets get started.   We came here because some of our friends said the food here was great. I'm always excited when friends rave about a new place. Upon entering, I was quite impressed. The hostess was friendly and the atmosphere was open and very trendy. What a great start, or do I thought.   We found our group and sat down. As we were chatting, this lady shows up and stands by our table and doesn't say anything. When we finally greeted her, we found out she was our server. She didn't even say her name or hello, just a 'can I get you something to drink?' We ordered some drinks and they took a really long time to arrive, one by one. Not a very good sign.  Ordered our food and hoped for the best. Here's what's on the menu:  APPETIZERS: Ceviche: good, not great. The fish seems like they were already cooked before everything was tossed together. The overall dish lacked flavor. It was precooked fish, scallops etc. tossed with lemon and avocados. The avocados gave the dish some flavoring. Not my favorite and will not be having it here again.   Bang bang shrimps: This dish is great to those that love mayo. It was good, I don't know if I would give this dish 5 stars. It over dressed and reminds me of having walnut shrimp at a Chinese buffet.   Caesar salad: Nothing too special here either. Both of your salads were overdressed and soggy. Not very appealing, especially when it seems like the dressing wasn't even made in house.   ENTREES:  Shrimps and scallop, mango salsa and green beans: To my surprise this dish was good. The scallops were cooked nicely and well seasoned. The shrimps were a bit undercooked so I didn't eat them. And my green beans were no longer green but brown, so I didn't eat those either.   Fish tacos: These were very good. Fresh and light. There's only two tacos so if you're hungry, order two orders.   Salmon and asparagus: salmon was flaky and not over cooked. Asparagus on the other hand were soft to the touch and brown.   Sea bass: I didn't try this dish but it did get great reviews at the table.   The food here isn't bad, but it also not amazing. But then again, what are you expecting from a chain restaurant? What would have made our experience better was the service. Our server was not friendly, didn't seem to know the menu items and it was slow and completely unorganized. Everything about the service aspect of this restaurant is unorganized.   They have a concept call \"team work\" here. This is when the team/staff needs to help each other by delivering food and clearing the table etc. this is a nice idea, except no one at this location seems to know how to do it. Drinks came one at a time. Coffee came one at a time. By the time we got our coffees, the rest of the table had already finished theirs and was waiting for us. Our table wasn't clear of all the empty appetizer plates before dinner got dropped. Our server failed to be a decent server. I'm sure if I went to Denny's, the server there would have done better job. Such a waste of a restaurant space. Bonefish has a lovely room and prime location but the staff is a joke.   I would recommend this place to people under the circumstance that they just sit at the bar. Here's a tip that I live by, PEOPLE COME FOR THE FOOD BUT COME BACK FOR THE SERVICE. Get it together bonefish. Look at your entire staff and start picking out the weeds or you'll be packing your bags and leaving not just henderson, but Vegas, for good.   Happy eating everyone, ciao :)",

The best part of this experience was the service. The tuna steak and the potatoes au gratin. I wasn't too thrilled with the steamed asparagus especially when they charge you $4 extra for it. The food is good but the pricing is a little too high for the type of food they serve. I would return just for the tuna steak and potatoes augratin themselves.",

I should have known better than to order steak from a fish place, but I did it anyway. Medium rare at this place has almost no pink left in the center. My buddy sent his back, I won't do that.   My second beer didn't look or taste anything like the first one. If you don't remember just ask me. I'll tell you what kind of beer I ordered.   I might try again, but if I got the same waitress I'd run.",

    "text": "830pm already out of beet salad. I'm sad .  Oh well.  Jesse had ordered what he thought was clam chowder, but it was corn chowder.  I tasted it and said, \"hello, it has bacon, its corn chowder!\"   It was Good Friday so it was no meat for us.  he verified with a server and they were kind enough to understand and gave us a house salad.  Ashley was our server and she was quite delightful.  Very prompt with service and not over checking in on us as we devoured our food.  Maryland Crabcakes kind of small, but I guess it matches the price. It's the lump type of crab cake if your wondering, what every crab cake should be! Not as thick of a patty, but in flavor, delish.  Side sauce complimented it as well. I think it was a spicy mayo sauce.  I went with the Chilean Sea Bass since it was a recommended entree.  I got the full order and I'm glad that I did.  If you are familiar with my appetite, I eat a lot .  It wasn't as flavorful, but i did order the sauce on the side.  It had more of the grill taste than flavor.  It was served with garbanzo beans and asparagus.  For those that are looking for healthy options, this is the place for you.  But if you have a sweet tooth like me, you need to try their brownie a la mode...hot brownie, drizzled in raspberry sauce, with macadamia nuts and topped off with vanilla ice cream.  Whoa, I just drooled.    Four stars for my first try, I'm gonna find a dish that will be my go to.  I loved the healthier options that i could choose from.  I am definitely returning and I do recommend.",

The restaurant itself is a little on the small side, but it's cute and definitely great for a date night or intimate conversation. The bar area has a TV and is pretty cozy. Service has been fairly consistent. We've had a couple servers that seemed like they were new and maybe having issues with explaining the menu properly but I can look past that when the food tastes as great as it does.   The food here is really phenomenal. Every time I've come here the fish always tastes incredibly fresh. You get free bread with pesto for dipping that is really fantastic and the bang bang shrimp is a must.   Great drinks, better food. Worth every penny.",

    "text": "Our birthday girl (mother in law) is on a diet and wanted a low carb dinner so we figured bonefish would be a good spot, she had never been there before.   Location is in town square,  but a stand-alone building so parking was ample.  They have a cute outside area which would be nice to hang out and have drinks. Interior was nice, looks similar to the bonefish that was on Eastern that has sadly closed.   We went for an early dinner and we were one of the first diners in the joint. our server Jamie was very nice, chatty and patient with us. They have iPads to take our order which was nice to see a company embracing technology an using it to their advantage.   We started off with the Hawaiian martini, it'a a little sweet for my tastebuds but the MiL loved it. We also ordered the mango martini which was very refreshing and had a nice little spice. I enjoyed the red sangria taste, however no fruit included- which I though was a little odd. It was entered into the iPad and instantly sent to the bartender- pretty cool!  We had the bang bang shrimp appetizer and edamame, both excellent. The soup is so tasty, that was slurped up in an instant! Eric enjoyed the Lily chicken and gobbled it up!  I had the server surprise me and she ordered the sea bass which was cooked to perfection. The MiL ordered dori picatta and was deeply disappointed. She had a few bites and ate her green beans and half of my sea bass. Honestly the scallops, fish and shrimp tasted quite awful and dry, like it was a frozen meal thrown in the microwave. We aren't the type to complain and the server saw she barely touched her food, so she sent the manager over to talk to us. The server and manager did the right thing and it was removed from our tab. It was a nice surprise and refreshing to know that there are still restaurants that care about the food, their reputation and most importantly, taking care of their patrons.   We polished off our meal with a coconut custard pie and they gave the birthday girl a small box of chocolate which made our dining experience better with the birthday girl leaving with a smile on her face.   Had it not been for the picatta, i would have rated this dining experience a 5!  But we'll be back!  Wednesdays are $5 bang bang shrimp - just so you know!",

Perfecto. Btw, do you know the original name for Chilean Sea Bass? Challenge the server when next you're there. (No goggling)",

Beautiful set up. Second: The staff, and especially the manager, is friendly and very professional. They recommend, and explain their specials etc.   I especially love the Bang Bang Shrimp sandwich. The mix of the dressing, the spices, the amount of shrimp, and the crispy light bread roll. Delicious!!!  My husband likes the fish and chip dish. The fish is very crispy and ligth. Yummy! Try it!",

I ordered the scallops and shrimp with a side of jasmine rice - and when I come back, I'll order it again.  There aren't many places in Las Vegas that you can find scallops under $38.00, but this is one of them - and they are GOOD!    Service was great, I asked for sauce recommendations, and was not disappointed.  Our bill was a little more than Cheesecake factory, but a little less than Morton's.  So the price is definitely right!    I love the servers' uniforms.  Makes me feel like I'm in a restaurant along the pier of the Maine coast.  Worth a trip or two if you've never been!",

    "text": "Tonight was a major disappointment.  Arrived at Bonefish at 7:00 without a reservation and had to wait 25 minutes.  That's understandable on a Friday evening, but it gave me a little time to look around.  Couldn't help think what a low budget place this is.  There's just nothing interesting or nice about it.  Cheap finishes, unarticulated surfaces, bathrooms that could be found in your run of the mill McDonald's...environment 2 out of 5.    After we were seated (2 adults, 2 children), we waited over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and only after we asked the hostess for help.  Not a good start.  When the waiter finally showed up, he tried pretty hard, but everything was very slow, and with kids, slow is tough...service 3 out of 5.  The salads came first.  Two \"watermelon salads\" consisting of a few small cubes of watermelon, a few small cucumber wedges, and a lot of leaves of I'm not sure what, all swimming in oil.  Great idea but way too much oil.  Then I had scallops wrapped in bacon.  Good, but the relish that came with them ruined the flavor.  My wife had a filet.  She ordered it medium well and it came out very well, and completely dry.  Sent it back and the 2nd try was perfectly cooked, but they butterflied it for some unknown reason.  She thought it was ok; I thought it was tender, not tasty.  The kid's food was fine (chicken and broccoli), but they were out of kid's cups and we had to monitor their drinks very carefully, since one is 3 and the other just turned two...food 2 out of 5.  This would have been bad enough until my pant leg touched the underside of the table and pulled down a piece of gum that had been stuck to it.  Scraped and rubbed my jeans for 10 minutes and got most of it off.  The place was overcrowded, and the vibe seemed fairly old.  Music was elevator type; waiters, bus boys and expeditors all wear the same ill-fitting jackets with faded black pants in various shades of gray.  Most of them looked like they hadn't showered...ambience and vibe - 1 out of 5.  Everything was medium priced to expensive.  The filet was $26 with corn on the cob.  Shots were $9.50...value - 1 out of 5.  We wanted it to be good, but it's a place we'll never go back to, and frankly have a hard time understanding some of the positive reviews.  It's the kind of experience you'd expect from Applebee's but at twice the price (and we aren't Applebee's fans).  Bottom line - don't bother.",

My boyfriend and I have a gluten sensitivity and every time we've come the server has been knowable on what they can do to accommodate us.  My favorite drink there so far is the Hawaiian Martini.  LOVE the salmon and sea bass!!    We tried the flourless brownie it was delicious for the first few bites, but i couldn't make it past the first brownie it was a bit to rich for me and gave me a headache. but kudos on the yummy tasting gluten free brownie!

We came in for lunch around 3:45 on a Sunday to a empty restaurant with the exception of two people finishing up their meal. We waited about 5 minutes to place drink orders then it went all downhill. Our water came out and we sat for about 30 minutes waiting to take our order while other servers just walk by avoiding eye contact at all cost. Finally our server pops up out of nowhere saying \"oh your not my table, but I will take your order anyways\" after that delightful experience we sit and wait and notice they are bringing bread out to people that arrived after us, so we ask another server for bread and she says we have to wait for our appetizer to come out, seriously? Btw our server never mentioned bread to us, so whatever getting more irritated. By this time everyone that arrived later than us are receiving entrees while again we sit there and wait. Finally we are fed up ask for boxes and check and she goes to help another table. I hope the management can resolve this issue, we will NEVER be back. I'm scared to see how this overstaffed restaurant works with a decent rush.",

    "text": "Not a good spot to eat at lunch unless you have the time. I don't know if it was the time of day, or what was going on.. I work close by and decided to go have lunch around 1:30 p.m.. We walked in and the hostess was nowhere to be found, a waiter did come to greet us and went to look for the hostess to seat us. The waiter that greeted us ended up serving us.. I ordered tea, appetizer, and our food, asked for sweetner, had to ask another server before I got it..  At least ten minutes later had passed, and had to asked another server about our appetizer and he came back to let us know that it will be another five minutes. I asked if our order was even entered and  he just smiled.. This guy was super attentive, brought us bread and came back to let us know that the manager was taking care of the appetizer. There were not a lot of customers at that time and my guess is that is why staff seemed to be MIA.. Manager never came to our table to address  our concerrns... Food was great, but not the service I expected...",

    "text": "FRESH!  That is the word of the day here at this restaurant.  The fish is so tasty that it was obviously swimming around in the water, very recently.  One of the best parts about the restaurant (aside from the deliciousness of the dinners) is the price.  Instead of going to Bartalotta's at Wynn and spending $200 a person, you can go to Bonefish and really indulge there for a mere $100 per couple (including everything).  So, when it comes down to it - both places give you super-fresh fish, but only one gets it to you at a great price.  I love this place and am hoping to visit there (and eat) again soon.  Kudos to Bonefish!!",

    "text": "Based on service alone this was the worst I have ever experienced in Vegas. I'm a local here and don't expect to be treated any different. The food took almost an hour to get out to us along with the drinks. We waited for almost 45 minutes for just the ticket to pay. We were in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Waiting. We were told  there was an issue with the system. Then we were told that the system went down. Then the waitress made a snide comment that because someone in our group of 7 moved to another seat that it ruined everything in the system. The surrounding tables all paid and left long before we even got our ticket. It's the worst service I've ever had. The food wasn't worth the cost either. It was severed incorrect to almost every person who ordered. Medium burgers come out as charred. No gluten means everything is served with gluten. And if you want warm food forget it. It was like eating food fresh out of the freezer. Ice cold. And to top it off no sorry from the manager. I wouldn't suggest eating here unless you are waiting for the world to end because that's about the amount of time you'll sit waiting for your food and ticket",

    "text": "\"Caitlin B\" was by far the worst server Ive ever encountered. I'm not sure if it was because of our appearances we were a younger couple and family but she had a bad attitude toward us since the moment she walked up. I have been a server for 5 years from high end steak house to bar and grill, and I would have never got away with treating a table the way she did . Being my first time and bonefish I wasn't real sure what all was on the menu but we wanted to just go ahead and order cause we had a movie to be to in just a little bit , so I had saw fish tacos and asked which were the best she personally liked, she paused for a good 5 seconds before saying \"uhhhh there's only one kind\" I apologized as I just wasn't sure sometimes there is different kinds, when my husband went to order he didn't know he could get two different sides , as I looked up I saw her rolling her eyes as she asked what else he wanted .. Anytime we thanked her for our drinks or anything we never got any type of response, never got a smile or anything nice so we felt welcome. The booth beside of us of (an elderly couple) she was being completely different to as I started watching after my husband and I looked at eachother and were saying how rude she was.. She was smiling at them checking on them, making sure everything was great etc. last but not least , we were sitting in a booth with direct vision into the kitchen, as I was watching her get our food together , and she switched plates because some had gotten hot as I could see, without ever seeing her go wash her hands she grabbed a handful of fries from one plate setting it on the other that we were eating.. In total disgust and Awh I watched to see if she actually was going to set it down for me to eat, and she did.. So I did not touch my fries ... As I was looking for a manager to talk to no one came by my table , so I went on to eat the tacos , and I needed a different hot sauce than the one Caitlin had set down originally. Mind you it was completely empty in the restaurant other than 6-7 tables . So finally I caught the hostess who was cleaning a table and asked her is they had a different hot sauce , she said she'd go back to check and came back with another one . We didn't see Caitlin again until we were finished and she asked us if we wanted our check, but we watched her in the kitchen laughing amongst other employees talking the whole time we were eating except when she checked on the table next to us... We paid the bill and left and told my sister about the experience whom advised I complain to a manager , but I didn't see one and just wanted to leave after that experience and said I'd email someone ... I have never left a negative review in my life, being a waitress I get we all have bad days , but it didn't seem that way.. That was hands down the worst experience I've ever had & have never been treated so horribly and felt so uncomfortable or disgusted .. I will honestly never be back and never go to another bonefish.",

But the third time I came with my fiance. There was no one in the restaurant because it was raining but our service was awful. At one time I had to go to the hostess just to ask for our waiter. Next they cooked my fiance steak wrong. When he asked about it they took it back and the second time they still cooked it wrong. After that we just wanted to leave we were going to spend our whole time going back and forth just to get a steak cooked correctly. The \"cook\" came out at least the cook that cooked his steak and he was the manager. He was ok but he said maybe bonefishs medium steak is different I thought asking for a steak cooked medium was the same across the board. The amount of money you spend here is not worth the service or the food! Don't bother coming here!",

However the food more than made up for it. The bang bang shrimp to start and anglers steak (11 oz) with Gorgonzola butter for the main course was incredible.

From there, the cocktails are delish (we had a variety of different hand-crafted cocktails from martinis to margaritas and more), and the starters are great (we tried the mussels and the Bang Bang Shrimp). All of our entrees were good, especially the Tilapia Imperial, and the desserts were to die for (we had the Strawberry Shortcake, brownie, and creme brulee). The shortcake was our favorite of the three. But aside from the interesting menu, inventive cocktails, and delicious food, Bonefish has exceptional service. Our waitress, Rachael, was attentive, congenial, and generally fabulous. She gave us great recommendations (I hate servers who respond to the question \"What would you recommend?\" with the question \"Well, what do you like?\"), and we left full and smiling, which is what dining out SHOULD be all about. :)",

We really enjoyed the Paco & Lola Albarino but it's $10 less a bottle at King's Fishhouse.  We loved the Bang Bang shrimp and Seared Ahi appetizers. However, the dinners were the real stars: Dorado with mango salsa on the side was incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill. Ditto for the Redfish special with Romesco sauce, on the side of course. Overall the food quality may be better than my memories of the old store in Henderson.  A couple of suggestions: I don't think open bus/service areas will ever be as popular as open kitchens were, so build a wall and add a door. It's ugly and distracting to have that area open to the lovely dining room. About those window shades, they're going the wrongway! Something is needed to block the lower part of the windows, to obscure the view of the parking lot and keep headlights from shining into the dining room.  A few minor issues that should be addressed but great food and drinks at reasonable prices. Hope they stick around for a long time.",

Bartender asked if we like a menu..sure..we said just bring us a meal you like best. He was excited..\"you got it\" Nice dealing with a pro. We had crab cakes, a bisque, Fontina Pork chops with mashed garlic potatoes and the Lily's Chicken. I have to say we were surprised, the chop was one of the best I've ever had, and everything else was great. Drinks were never empty, and the pours were strong. Interesting note: he didn't bring out any fish!  Don't wait for the dining area, eat at the bar!",

    "text": "Loved it! One of the girls at work experienced their happy hour a few weeks ago, so we decided to try it out. We got there a bit before 5 and were seated immediately. The staff were very friendly, however, they did not explain their happy hour specials very well. I asked if the table notice were all of their specials, and looked around the menu for what it entails with no luck. So we ordered the bang bang tacos and the ceviche. A-Maz-Ing!  Still hungry, we decided to order more and some drinks. I caved and got one of the specialty drinks because it did not appear that a glass of wine was part of the happy hour special. After we ordered (the bang bang shrimp, yum!) we found out that there were more options for happy hour--including a $3 glass of wine!  The food was great! The specialty drink, the blood orange one, was meh.  And more clarification would be appreciated!",

I got a response within 24 hours from Danny McCumber and he offered us reserved seating in the bar, a champagne toast and box of chocolates for the birthday girl. I was taken back at the excellent care just on an email. I was excited to see how it all came together. When I called to make the reservation the hostess was extremely helpful and very thorough. Upon arrival Marcus Power greeted me and made me feel as if nothing could go wrong and he had us taken care of. He is amazing! I have been in Vegas for 20 years and I can't remember the last time a manager had been so attentive. Good service just doesn't exist like that anymore! The food was perfect, our server was wonderful. our party of 8 was so impressed we plan to visit many more times. Kudos to a wonderful staff and management, you really made us all feel like it was all our birthday's!",

    "text": "What makes Bonefish so special is that they serve high quality food at very reasonable prices. They offer seasonal cocktails at $5, specialty drinks at around $8. Their filets range from $19---$21-- with a side. Why pay strip prices for comparable food when you can get it here for so much less! Friday night was all a buzz here. We left our name with the hostess and told it would be about a 40 minute wait. No problem since we wanted to get drinks at the bar. The bartender was very nice and attentive and also quite knowledgable on drink selections. Not more than 10 minutes passed until we got paged for our table. We ordered the Hawaiian martini and let me say that I felt like I was in Hawaii after taking a sip of this beautiful drink accented by coconut water.  After enjoying fresh hot bread and pesto, we started with the ahi sashimi...one of the best and better than Roy's. The ahi was so delicate and had a perfect sesame crust with a light wasabi sauce that wasn't overpowering but complimented the ahi. We both order the filet mignon...available in 6oz or 8oz portions. Get it with the Gorgonzola butter! Service timing was on as the sashimi came out within a few minutes and our filets were ready right after we finished the appetizer. The filet was cooked to the perfect temp for each of us and very flavorful even without the delicious Gorgonzola butter...but it made it so much better. The potatoes au gratin were the perfect portion and cheesy with a breadcrumb topping. Our favorite dessert here is the strawberry shortcake. In season strawberries with whipped cream atop fresh creme anglaise (it's like melted rich vanilla ice cream) and a flakey shortcake biscuit. Great way to end our wonderful meal. Being a fan of the other location that closed on Eastern, I was thrilled to see Bonefish re-open here at Town Square. We will be regulars here.",

But then we say there.... We waited too long for the server to arrive at our table. It was slow and the server wasn't busy. He never asked \"can I get you anything\"  it was \"do you need something\" I just find that a little rude. The food came out quickly which was nice. Enjoyed the bread while waiting. When finished, We asked for our check and once he dropped it off, he disappeared. I was going to pay on the card but after waiting too long I chose to pay with cash and leave a less than satisfactory tip. And I'm not sure if out server was high on some sort of drug or just extremely tired, but he seemed very awkward and was hardly visible. The food was delicious, but the service was absolutely terrible. I might return if I get a different server.",

We went at 6.30pm on a Friday, and tried ordering the special... \"We're out of the special\", so my wife ordered the seabass that happened to be more expensive than the special, but asked for the pasta that was described on the special. So the bill comes, and they charge an additional $5 for the pasta, in addition to the $25 for a piece of fish! Annie never told us about the charge when ordering, then argued when we disputed the $5 charge. I gave her my credit card, the check comes back for signing, but with no adjustment! Then she has this attitude and slams the check back on the table and says (in a very sarcastic voice) \"have a nice night you two\" Pathetic attempt at service! ***note to the management*** that $5 just cost you all our future business, and that of all our friends that will listen!!!",

    "text": "So Jason wouldn't shut up about the Bang Bang shrimp since he'd had it while on TDY in Florida, so naturally after we rolled by Bonefish Grill after a day shopping at Town Square, we had to make plans to visit. We did so a couple weeks later after the Wine Walk in Town Square.  We started with the Bang Bang. Jason noted that the portion was much larger than he had received in Fl and it tasted exactly like he remembered. Maybe it was the wine talking, but I wasn't that big of a fan- I'll probably have to try it again sober.  Jason had the trout in the lemon sauce, and opted for the potatoes au gratin. His fish was delicious! The au gratin gave him a little trouble though, he noted that it was delicious, but when he took a deep breath over his food, the breadcrumbs of the au gratin had gotten lodged up into his trachea. DON'T BREATHE HEAVILY OVER THE AU GRATIN!  I ordered the fish n chips.. but with quinoa instead of fries. The quinoa was AMAZING! Very fresh, and crisp. The fish was also much better than I had expected following finding out it was tilapia. I was very happy with it, but even better was the tarter sauce. The best I think I had ever had.  Service was also on point. Was a good meal, and we will definitely be back, but won't be making any special trips down here for it. If you're in the area, definitely stop by.",

We stopped in as a family on a Saturday night (admittedly, after another restaurant next door had a 45+ minute wait) on a whim (read, no reservations... not usually a good idea for this town) and were seated immediately even though the restaurant looked pretty busy.    The hostess was cheerful and friendly.  Our waiter (Josh W. I think-- it was a few weekends ago) was great.  Fantastic attitude, expertly handled multiple random questions from the child, and was attentive but not overbearing.  He answered all of the questions we had and made good recommendations on the menu.  The rest of the staff who helped out at the table did so without getting in each other's way, were all professional and courteous, and they were all smiling (I remember, because I wasn't having the best night and it really made a difference in my attitude to see them all smiling).    The food was great, portions were just right and flavorful.  The atmosphere was appropriate for a Saturday night dinner.  It was conversation-level noise, not too much but not too quiet.   There is a children's menu and non-seafood choices on the regular menu.",

We ordererd our food and a great tasting order of calamari arrived soon after and it was scrumptious. Top three calamities I have had or can recall.       Then we waited...we arrived and sat down by 5:45 p.m. at 6:40 our food arrived. Kids food good it's hard to mess up Mac n cheese and chicken strip's. My wife had ahi ahi seared it was supposed to be rare the only way to truley enjoy a steak of ahi. It was medium and barely warm a sign of sitting under a heat lamp for 10 to 15 minutes. I know this because I have worked in the food industry for 10+ years. But it was still tasty. Unfortunately I had ordererd sea scallops and shrimp which if it is not promptly served and sits under a heat lamp it will be unpalletable. Well it was chewyover, over cooked, and just messy. In addition the side of green beans was undercooked! Greas and burnt pieces of foods were all over the plate it looked like a methed up greasy spoon diner cook slopped it out. But here comes the shinning moment where service out shone the bad experience. I told the waiter the food was overcooked he promptly appologized and took it away to fix it. It came back fast and we'll cooked it was delicious. The scallops had the light fluffy buttery goodness I know. The shrimp was well cooked and flavorful just how I wanted it. Then the manager Eddie came over apologized for the food and then found out we had been here for well over an hour by this point. He comped our appetizer which made me happy then bought us dessert and gave us a complimentary appetizer for our next visit. Which we will do. Thank you Eddie and staff because of the service and attention paid to us we will be back and I will recommend this place the food was good. Thank you Bonefish for a great meal to end a great day. We will see you soon.",

Bonefish Grill is one of those places it seems all my friends are raving about and I didn't see the point in going to...until I went. This place was a great time. The food was remarkable, especially considering how affordable it was. We are talking quality sea food for a price that isn't too much more than TGI Friday's \"fancy\" menu.   We dined here for our 3 year wedding anniversary and the service was superb. Everyone we encountered, especially our waiter, was very kind. We struck up conversations with nearly every staff member we spoke to and to top it off the food was great.   I love swordfish, the steak of the sea. I always order it when I go out to seafood places as a gauge of said place's quality. If you're bold enough to serve swordfish, you better make sure you do it right. Spoiler: they did a great job.  Overall, I would absolutely eat here again AND recommend the place. Give it a whirl, kids!",

Appetizers: Edamame- Pretty run of the mill and nothing to write home about, but damame is always delicious. Bang bang shrimp- A customer favorite and it's easy to see why. The breading was like and didn't overpower the shrimp and the sauce is a creamy slightly spicy concoction. Everyone enjoyed them.  Coconut shrimp- Definitely the winning appetizer dish of the evening. Some of the best coconut shrimp any of us at the table had ever had! Even my mother, who is not a shrimp eater to begin with, absolutely loved them. And the Thai chili sauce was delicious.  For the main dishes we had swordfish, Chilean sea bass, and a steak. All the dishes where thoroughly enjoyed and the garlic potatoes were great.  Dessert:  Creme brulee- extremely delicious and an extremely generous portion.   Macadamia nut brownie- It is impossible to go wrong mixing macadamia nuts and chocolate. That is all.   Strawberry short cake- Delicious,  but definitely overshadowed by the other desserts.   All around a good dining experience. We will definitely be returning.",

We use to eat at the location on Eastern and were disappointed when we saw that it closed.. j So we were very happy to see them back at Town Square.   Stopped in Friday night. They had a good crowd, fortunately it was only a 15 minute wait.   The decor and set up looked almost identical to the other, nice and comfortable   Once seated we were greeted immediately and our drink order was taken, we were told about the specials, all but the one we saw on Yelp.. So not sure if that's really a special. Because it wasn't shown as a check in special...  We started off with Bang Bang Shrimp! Always a winner. Crisp, fried shrimp tossed in a spicy remolaude sauce. Plenty for a table of four or more..   My husband ordered the fish tacos which he said they were good. .  I ordered the Crab Corn Chowder and Ceviche. The chowder was rich & creamy... with a few lumps of crab and corn. I would have liked it if it had more crab.   The ceviche was good. Nice and light. Lots of seafood, scallops, shrimp & fish..   Our waiter and wait staff were EXCELLENT!  The GM came to our table after our meal and asked about everything too.   Love great service and this place has it! Looking forward to my next meal!",

    "text": "We were excited to try Bonefish Grill when we were visiting Las Vegas because of all the great reviews. Their menu items looked appetizing and it was conveniently located at the Towne Square (an upper scale version of The Americana or The Grove).  The GOOD: [Substitutions] I chose an entree that was supposed to come with two skewers (scallops and shrimp). Being slightly allergic to shrimp, they were able to change it to another skewer of scallops. They didn't have anything else on the menu that was just scallops or scallops without shrimp.  [Not Crowded]  We were seated right away.  The BAD: [Slow Service] It was awesome that we were seated right away, but when it's not crowded and the dining experience is a two hour long one, not cool.  [Mojitos Sucked] Everyone was raving about the Black Cherry Guava Mojito, but for some reason it had an after taste (maybe artificial sweetener?). I'm a REAL sugar type of girl and the drink would have been better with real cane sugar or just regular simple syrup. FYI - it wasn't indicated on the menu what type of sugar was used.  OVERALL: It was nice to try once, but if I had a choice between dining here or a casual eatery like California Fish Grill back home, I would pick the later because of taste and variety alone.

A couple of my friends were vegan and vegetarian and they were told they could not order off the pre made menu. I just feel they could have been more considerate when it comes to dietary restrictions. Also after 2 hours we received a total of 2 mimosas when it's \"bottomless\". I feel if you can't sustain the resources to maintain a bottomless mimosa brunch you should not advertise this. Also based on the \"contract\" that my friend had that she wasn't aware of we were forced to have one check for 20+ people.",

This guy is super cool and genuine, unscripted and real. It's nice to come across these rare servers that I wish could be copied and dispersed amongst all other restaurants.  When I come back I'll definitely ask for him   Our total for both dishes and a side of side of clam chowder (also a little spicy) was $34",

    "text": "OK ate here a few years ago and it was absolutely fantastic flew into Vegas and was hoping to relive that.  I have also eaten add a bonefish Grill in Florida which was actually pretty good!  In Las Vegas as you know there are many many choices and good restaurants to go to and I choose the bonefish Grill, sadly it was a complete mistake!!!  When we first walked through the door there was The strong odor of fish and it wasn't a good odor!  We had made a reservation and I was really surprised at how few people there were at the restaurant even during the hour we were there  Appetizers came first calamari and the mussels. The calamari was excellent but the muscles had somewhat of a fishy taste and yes I know it's seafood but I get muscles all the time that don't taste like this. In spite of it we ate the mussels but not all of them.  It was Friday so we specifically came here for Fish being a Catholic family and it being Lent. I opted for the crab crusted cod with green beans and potatoes au gratin.  My wife had the Rockefeller cobia with potatoes and broccoli.  She said her fish was decent,  she wasn't thrilled with the broccoli and the potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  the crab crusted Alaskan cod had zero taste it was extremely bland I ended up having to get some of the dipping sauce from the calamari to pour on it  I originally ordered an iced tea and my wife ordered a cocktail her cocktail came out one before my ice tea when I finish my tea I had to ask two different people one of them twice for an iced tea. I also asked for better for my Green Bay which they immediately forgot. When I finally did get the butter which was after I decided to eat no more of the cod or the potatoes I could barely cut the green beans with a butter knife they provided in the green beans were hard and crunchy  The only two things good about the meal with the calamari and my wife's cocktails.  I have to say I don't intend to ever come back and I hope they never opened one in Southern California!",

    "text": "Bonefish Grill has usually been a consistent favorite of ours - consistent in food quality, service no matter which Bonefish Grill we go to - although our dinner tonight would make us think again.   First off, our server, Rachel, was awesome even with her hands full training a new person. She did everything within her capabilities to remedy our dinner experience. If not for her, I rate this barely a 1 star.  Main issues: 1. Bang Bang Shrimp - flavor was still there but...bed of lettuce seemed like it had slightly brown edges but brushed it off because it.may have been the sauce, and the batter on the shrimp was \"slipping\" off. Definitely not a good start.  2. Fish-n-Chips - portion sized was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller and there was batter than fish! We inquired about this and was told that it could have been a result of inconsistent cuts. 2 additional peices were then brought in to make up for the issue.  3. Shrimp Pad Thai - had this dish before and it WAS good, now no longer. It tasted over sweet like it had been drenched in sweet chili sauce, noodles stuck together in clumps, and the shrimp was added in like an afterthought instead of part of the dish as it had ZERO taste and was rubbery. Now I don't expect it be the same as in a real Thai restaurant but this dish has been on their menu for awhile.   4. Ice tea refill was so watered down that I had to being it to their attention to get the real stuff  5. Overheard the tables around us also having issues i.e. sides listed on the menu not available because they were given an old menu, food not cooked as expected, etc...  We hope this was just an off night for Bonefish Grill but to be safe we will wait a bit before our next visit that is if we dare to return.",

Location - I like how it's away from the busy area of the strip - always a plus.   For the love of all things good and holy, try the Wood-Grilled Atlantic Salmon with just the lemon butter sauce! It's just so simple but it's always spot on. In this case, less is more. I've had their spring special with the salmon dynamite style, I did not like it as much. I think the flavor was overwhelming that it overpowered the fish.   The service here is consistently excellent and the food is always fresh.   I highly recommend this place.",

Fish cooked perfectly. Sauteed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were great sides to compliment the fish. The servers/bussers were all extremely friendly.  They also gave us a cute little box of chocolates and a happy anniversary card that was personalized. It also came with a coupon for a free rock shrimp appetizer!  The rock shrimp was pretty good but would have been so much better if it didn't have such a fishy taste.   Overall good experience.  The service made the food taste better ;) Thanks Holly!!",

My husband and I went to this location June 27,2019 and had a reservation at 7. When we got there we waited almost 15 min for a reservation. So when asked whats going on we didn't get much info. So finally when we got our table him and I already knew what we wanted before we sat down. So of course we couldn't go here and not have Bang Bang Shrimp (delicious). We both had crab cakes,lobster tail and our 2 sides. Idk if they were just to busy or our server Holly F. had too many tables but we were ignored ALLA evening. We had to flag another server down just to get more water. She came over to our table once and by that time we were both over it and ready to go.     Once we finally got out check she took another 10 min just to pick up our payment. My husband and I already felt uncomfortable and felt we were purposely being ignored. I don't want to bring race into it but we were the only African American couple that night. When we finally got our receipt I wanted to go off but I just grabbed my stuff and left. I'm suprised with that visit because BFG usually has amazing service",

We immediately ordered crab cakes and pot stickers for appetizers. Ordered our food shortly (5-10min) after letting the server know one person at the table had a shellfish allergy.   Before our appetizers even came out our friend started having an allergic reaction and had to leave. We immediately notified the server of the trouble and asked to cancel our food order that we would just be doing appetizers and leaving. Server asked if everything was okay, we assured her nothing life threatening and she immediately canceled the order. Moments later a manger came to the table just to ensure everything was okay. After another few moments another person came to the table (I am going to assume another manager) just asking what happened and actually shared with us the reaction could have just happened from it being in the air common since they fry some shellfish.   In closing, the appetizers were great there menus looked wonderful I'm excited to go back and try. Their decor is beautiful and elegant. Bathrooms were clean and up kept.  The professionalism of the staff over something that had the potential to be serious and life threatening was wonderful. I felt like they genuinely cared about his health and well-being.",

While they have a solid corporate format, the ambience is always just right to create a relaxing feel, but you'll almost be guaranteed to get an excellent meal... as long as the food runners bring it out in time. ;-)  I always sit at the bar (two big TVs), and there's always an excellent Happy Hour with things like calamari, mussels, sliders, and artichokes for $6! You can't beat that! Keep an eye out for their daily specials, like $6 Bang Bang shrimp on Wednesday or 3-course meals starting at $15 on Tuesdays.  The coconut shrimp, pork chop, and Lily's chicken here are divine. Pair with some sauteed spinach and rice, and you really couldn't ask for anything else. Except for a flourless mac nut brownie a la mode after.",

The shrimp were perfectly cooked and paired with the sauce as it was a little sweet and spicy all at the same time.    The bread was warm and served with oil one oil and I think a pesto taste. Warm bread with a hint of garlic.    My salad was full of bacon bits, eggs blue cheese crumbles, small cherry tomatoes, avocados and I topped it off with oil and vinegar dressing.  Perfect.    My husbands tacos were packed with fish and mango salsa.  Although I didn't taste his order it looked really delicious.

I got an email about two weeks ago for a pineapple shrimp and coconut risotto special which sounded great and thats what brought me in. While looking at the menu I didn't see it listed. I asked our server about it and she thought they still had it but said she would double check. She brought our drinks and still hadn't checked on it.   When she came back to take our order she said they didn't have it anymore, that was awfully fast to take it off. Anyway I ordered the seared ahi with potatoes au gratin and steamed broccoli. Although the ahi was very good the sides were absolutely horrible. The potatoes were way undercooked, almost raw and the cheese sauce tasted like something from a birds eye frozen box. The broccoli was so overcooked it was totally limp and tasteless. I showed the server and she said she would tell the manager.   We had plenty of room for dessert since I didn't eat the sides. They had a chocolate lava cake specials described as \"hot molten chocolate center\". When it was delivered it was completely cooked through. No lava in the lava cake. It also was only served with whipped cream, no ice cream. The server saw we weren't eating it and we showed her the inside. She said she would have the manager make us a new one. The manager brought us a new one but it was practically the same. Again we didn't eat it. She brought us our bill and nothing was taken off.   I don't ever expect free food, but I sure don't think I should have to pay for something that I didn't eat because it was cooked improperly. The manager said he was sorry for all the issues we had and gave us a card for a free bang bang shrimp. Ya, thanks but we won't be returning.",

Located in Town Square, it's than fancier Wahoo Fish Taco's. The decor much nicer than WFT. Not quite elegant, but nicer than cozy.  They had what read as a nice non-alcoholic mocktail. Muddled blackberries, coconut water, \"lightly sweetened\" and a touch of mint. Sounded amazing, so I ordered it. I KNEW, I knew I should have asked about the sweetener, but I didn't.....and I didn't care for it. The waiter said it was a simple syrup but I've never tasted a simple syrup with such a weird taste. Also, nothing in that description would lead one to believe it's tea...but it's brown. Had it referenced tea, I would not have tried since I only like unsweetened tea. Anyway, on to the food!  We started with the humus appetizer. I enjoyed that A LOT. Very tasty humus, garnished with roasted cherry tomatoes', golden raisins (I swear, I dont like raisins, but I think I'm just kidding myself. I LOVE when they are added as an ingredient!) and some seed (not sunflower) on top. It is served with a salty like flat bread. I really liked this. I'd come back just for this! For lunch, I ordered the fish sandwich; tilapia. It was better than OK, but not good. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't say WOOOOW either. I got the asian cole slaw and, to me, there was NOTHING asian about it except the chinese cabbage. They sweeten it waaaay too much, which is odd, since I really like a sweeter cole slaw. I think they are very heavy when they sweeten something here. I wanted to like the slaw, but I only had a few bites as it was just toooooooo sweet for me. (what's happening to me? next I wont like chocolate???)  Our server was Jason and he was nice and friendly. Drinks and food came out pretty quick. He checked on us occasionally to see if we needed anything else. The manager stopped by our table, looked like he was gonna say something, and walked away....kinda weird.  Anyway, I will definitely come back, at least for the humus. Nothing else on the menu really jumped out at me but man, that humus. That was good.",

    "text": "I was super excited that they opened another Bonefish Grill in Las Vegas, after the location on Easten closed a few years ago.    Came here with a few girlfriends to have some beers and appetizers.  It was even better than I remembered, and I am thrilled about the patio!  Always looking for new places to drink outdoors.    We went on a Wednesday, which is Bang Bang Shrimp night - you can get this appetizer for $5 from 4-11pm on Wednesdays.  Those shrimp are delicious!   We also got the ahi tuna appetizer, beef dumpling appetizer, and crab cakes which were all very good.  We ordered a side of the au gratin potatoes because they looked like macaroni and cheese, and they were amazing cheesy goodness.    Can't wait to go back and see if all the entrees are just as I remember!",

    "text": "From a food perspective - We loved this place! I am a huge mussels fan, and my appetizer served as an entree!  Amazing portions, high quality food, very tasty and well presented.  My son had the grilled chicken, and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger which was incredible.  The biggest standout of the night was our server, Jamie.  She was friendly, knowledgable, attentive but not intrusive!  I adored her and we even gave her our cards to stay in touch.  Here's the not so great part - This is one of the most awful dining rooms I have ever been in.  The tables are set NYC style and so close that our chairs not only touched the chairs of the surrounding tables, but I heard more about the other's tables' relationships and work issues than I would have liked.  Additionally, the kitchen entrance is so large you look all the way down the line.  Not in a sexy, open air kitchen kind of way, but in a \"did the drape not come in\" or \"is that a mistake\" kind of way.  And, lastly, the way that the booths are set around the perimeter combined with the height of the tables and the color of the space made me feel like I was squished at the children's table.  It was so uncomfortable that we actually left earlier than we would have had the space been more comfortable.  I would love to go back, but I would not sit in that dining room again.  Which means that I'm stuck in weather permitting dates when I can sit on the patio!  PS - One final thought - The highchair to table hight was so awkward that my daughter's forehead was literally up against the table edge.  Not safe and felt very unnerving!",

    "text": "First time here was pretty awesome. Tried their famed bang bang shrimp, maryland crab cakes, kobe beef burger, and it was all excellent. Service was prompt and attentive.  So was looking forward to a second time. However, it was a letdown and makes me not want to rush back for a third time.  The bang bang shrimp themselves have no flavor, but that's what the sauce on it is for. The complimentary bread they offer is wonderful, especially when freshly baked and warm. Even better with some balsamic vinegar in the olive oil. Most of the appetizers and entrees seem about $1-3 overpriced.   Our server was adequate, but no real enthusiasm. During the time we went, there must have been an issue with the grills or the kitchen itself because for about 40 minutes, no entrees seemed to be coming out of the kitchen. The surrounding tables were all waiting for food as well. Things happen, which is understandable. However, our server never kept us updated or apologized for the long wait. Between the time our appetizer of bang bang shrimp and wagyu beef potstickers and our actual entrees was close to 50 minutes.  But again, the whole time there was not a peep from our server or communication as to why food was taking so long to arrive.  Just felt like they didn't care at all how long we had to wait for food. So not exactly jumping at the chance to return.",

Not much you expect from oatmeal... But the problem is that they gave me super sour/tart with awful tasting blueberries that weren't ripe. I had to remove them from the oatmeal. I told the waitress about them and didn't really get a sincere response. Next thing I see is another guy taking the box of blueberries somewhere else from the kitchen...I hope I don't get sick from it. Then I had the oscar omelet which was so so. Food is not as upscale as the place looks. I told my friend, don't take me here for my bday ever lol!",

His service was excellent because he went out of his way to bring my sunglasses to me, right after my son had gotten sick (from coughing too much) in the parking lot. He brought us towels to clean up and stayed until he knew my son was OK. We will definitely be back here sometime in the very near future!",

So, I had to take him there for my birthday dinner one year ago.  This review is for my overall impression of Bonefish from multiple trips.  Delightful happy hour specials.  I cannot come here without having the bang bang shrimp.  The last time I was there, I decided to opt for the bang bang shrimp burger.  With shared apps, I did not finish my burger, but that meant I go to take it home and enjoy the following day for lunch.  Sign up for the email.  Bonefish will send you emails for discounts or other fun events.  I feel like they are teasing me with the brunch that they offer on holidays.  I will make it there one day!",

We wonder if the waiter is in a dirty uniform what else is dirty in the restaurant, possibly the kitchen.   We spoke with customer service who said that they hoped this doesn't stop us from returning to the restaurant, but said nothing about correcting the problem.

She picked the perfect pairing of wine with my steak. This has now become one of my favorite steak locations even though they are seafood centered. The price is moderate and a little undercharged for the quality of food. I will definitely be visiting again.",

    "text": "We ventured over here for lunch away from the strip. It's a nice mid-range restaurant. The server was friendly and very efficient, which made the dining experience pleasant.  I had the bang bang shrimp. I was curious since it seems to be a 'thing' at Bonefish Grill. It was just ok. I expected something spicy that would be filled with a burst of flavor. It wasn't. It was fried shrimp with a light creamy sauce coating. If you're going to say something is spicy - it really should be spicy. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't heat either. The tortillas on the soft tacos were hard. I'm not sure if it was because the tortillas were not fresh or if they were grilled and left out too long. The side of pesto couscous was good. It was light and refreshing.  One dining companion had the grilled fish of the day lunch entree which was rock fish. Mango salsa was added. He got a side of Asian slaw. This dish was so good, he didn't even share one bite. He said it was really good. The other companion had the Lily's salmon lunch entree with fries. I didn't try this one either, but at least he offered. It was a beautiful presentation on the plate (except for the fries).  For dessert we shared the coconut pie. Keep in mind this isn't a cream pie (in case you're more familiar with that). It was served with whipped cream on top. It smelled sugary and sweet. Once I took a bit, I was intrigued. It had a familiar taste. The consistency and flavor was different, but it reminded me of coconut butter mochi. It really seemed like this dessert was inspired by one of my favorite treats. Yay! This dessert will definitely bring me back here!",

Chilean Sea bass with mango salsa, jasmine rice and sauteed spinach was wonderfully delicious. My friend had Atlantic Salmon with herb pesto and doubled her spinach choice. Dessert: delicious Creme brulee  Waiter was excellent. Sound proofing on ceiling was wonderful as we could carry on a conversation even while this place is packed with people and 2 TVs are on side wall with closed captioning.

Not only were we taken care of in a timely manner, but the food was genuine and the service was welcoming.

    "text": "The original location by my area in seven hills shut down but luckily I was excited t hear that they relocated by town square.   The restaurant is located in the outskirts of townsquare by las vegas blvd at the NE section of the shopping center.  We arrived just before dinner was starting and were seated in the dining area within a few seconds.  The waitress was complaining to the manager saying, \"really i have to do all these tables?\" This really irked me and literally made me want to leave but i figure i would at least try out the food and enjoy my company with my lady.  Initial Service: The waitress wasn't very pleasing as she came to our table with this \"Why do i have to serve you\" sort of expression which continued to ruin my experience there.  Took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I got the bonefish martini which was actually pretty good and gave a decent buzz.  She got the fresh cucumber collins which was refreshing.    Entrees: We read all about the bang bang and we basically did a drive by.  We ordered bang bang tacos,  bang bang chicken and bang bang shrimp lmao.  Plus it was a good \"bang\" for the buck being $6 for each entree during happy hour on i think it was a wednesday?  The entrees were all very good but it was too much bang.  The sauce they use is like a spicy mayo with green onions.  Ending:  I ordered another martini and noticed something shiny in my drink.  Thought it was a golden ticket for Wonka's chocolate factory but it was aluminum from a whisky top.  I reported this to the manager and he apologized by saying hes not sure how they got there but it must've been from the ice machine.  He ended up comping one of our bang bangs and getting me a new drink \"metal free.\"  Overall:  Poor service with the waitress.  Great alcohol and good food.

The staff was very attentive, making sure we had what we needed and providing great recommendations.   Bonefish grill has a fully stocked bar. We had dirty martinis, beer, wine, jack and coke and even a fuzzy navel.   All the food was superb, including the bread they first serve you, the Mussles Josephine appetizer to the fish, lobster and filet mignon.   I personally ordered the ahi tuna steak topped with the mango salsa a side of string beans and truffle Mac & Cheese.  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the mango salsa was fresh and sweet. The string beans were crunchy and perfectly seasoned and the truffle Mac & Cheese was creamy and delicious. I highly recommend it.",

My SO did not enjoy his trout at all, it was dry with no flavor. He also got the Brussel sprouts, which we usually like brussel sprouts, but they were bitter and gross. I'm sure if he chose something else on the menu, he would have had a better experience. That's fine and all, but when it came to dessert, we were very disappointed. I ordered the creme brulee. It's one of my favorites, but this creme brulee was soggy on top. It should be hard, so you can crack open the top. We informed the staff, they apologized and brought out a new one. Only for the new one to have the same issue. And it was cold, almost like they stuck it in the fridge after torching the top, which is a big no no in the industry. The cooler melts sugar in a sense, which would cause the creme brulee to become soggy like that.",

Well that one anyway... everything else had peanuts in it so i couldn't try them.  Now, our server was very knowledgeable and had a great personality that's what made the experience pleasant! Good job on hiring him!  But overall the food wasn't very good and not sure if I'll be back again unfortunately.

The space is nice and simply decorated. The tables are spaced closer than I like but if you get a booth, you will feel less claustrophobic.  I have 3 favorite entree dishes:  Cobb Salad (with shrimp or salmon) Grilled Salmon Superfood Salad Triple Decker BLT with Lobster  The food is delicious and made with quality ingredients and  definitely a good \"bang for your buck\".  For dessert, I really love Jen's Jamaican Coconut Pie (get it!). It's served warm and best not shared .  I have never had a bad meal here and the service is always attentive and friendly.  Bonefish has weekday deals and happy hour specials so I recommend that you go check it out if you have never been!",

I also tried a cup of their crab & corn chowder- delicious! And a generous serving.   To drink, I tried the blueberry lemon drop; very refreshing and balanced.

We had a party of about 20 people, it started out fine we were seated and given water and bread immediately once majority of the party showed up and the birthday girl we ordered our food, still goin pretty smooth.  No appetizers   It didn't take too long to get my food especially serving 20 people (the staff did seem a bit overwhelmed),  once I received my food, the wood fired salmon with lemon sauce, broccoli and potatoes (that I deeply enjoyed), I notice my wife was not enjoying hers. This is where we run into problems, we let staff know about the issue and they allowed my wife to replace her order and remove the one she didn't like from our tab. The problem is everyone starts finishing there food and my wife still has not received her new order!  I remind the server and he lets us know they forgot about it, at this point I'm pissed. We ultimately request to have the food prepared to go which just takes soo long, the silver lining in this story is later my wife let's them have it through email and they make it right... we returned at a later date to have a wonderful nite and the food and service was exceptional.   Thanks for stepping up bone fish this was a three star review but Shawn our server deserves acknowledgement he took very good care of us keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Bonefish Grill. I don't know rather I should begin complimenting the service or the food because both deserve a level of praise that's well overdue!   I came here for a friends birthday and things were a tad bit bumpy, I'm sure due to the party's continuous growth. People kept showing up that the hosts didn't expect and orders were understandably mixed up! Long story short, the manager, Clay, went above and beyond to make sure we received the service we deserved!   Not even 2 weeks later, I'm back with my hubs to enjoy the salmon! We ordered the same plates. Salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus, and not to forget the delicious bath-in-able lemon butter sauce! Mmm yes, Devine! The salmon was fresh, far from fishy, meaty, grilled with beautiful marks to perfection! The potatoes and asparagus stood up well next to this star plate!   The dessert. Jamaican coconut pie. Oh man, let's say it was so good, I waited for Darren C to fall asleep so I could polish it off without sharing. Please forgive me.   I must say, and I was dumbfounded..the food arrived at lightening speeds. I'm talking Jimmy John's speed! It was hot and fresh, I just don't know how they pulled it off! I will definitely be back and cannot wait to try the lobsta!   Oh yea, someone please give Shawn a raise! That man was on it! He checked on us like it was his business and his mission to please! Never had to look up, he was always there! Great job, Shawn!",

    "text": "After multiple brunch visits throughout the years, time to give Bonefish Grill some Yelp props...  Bonefish Brunch service:  They're a pretty popular brunch spot on Sundays and the staff is well prepared for the rush.  Servers have always been friendly overall (some muuuch better than others) and the kitchen gets the dishes out timely during consistently packed brunch rushes.  There's a fully stocked bar and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  Clean modern bistro style seating for makes for a nice dining experience.  The servers wear crisp white chef coats and are helpful with ordering.  Bonefish Brunch Cuisine:  The Bang Bang Shrimp is my favorite starter on the brunch menu.  Packed with flavor and with their creamy spicy sauce, this gets ordered just about every visit.  The Thai Coconut Shrimp is another hit shrimp dish here.  I\"ve ordered the wagyu burger with egg numerous times and every time has been a filling and tasty experience.   I've had the California omelette when i was feeling healthy and it's pretty delish considering it's a 'healthy' option.  All the dishes I've sampled throughout the brunch visits have been prepped well overall.  Some visits have included bottomless mimosas and the staff has been pretty good with keeping the glasses fresh.  It does get packed in here during brunch so it's going to be a little noisy.  Bonefish Grill is a great brunch place to meet out of town visitors who are staying on the strip.  Cheers!",

However, this was my first time ever seeing cockroaches in plain sight at a restaurant...  Service: our server was really nice and fast. We told her we were in a rush and the food came out super quick.   Food: I've always ordered the scallops and shrimp entree.  It's less than $25 and you get a decent amount of food with 2 side choices. You can have it prepared in the sauce of your choice!   Ambiance: kind of like a Cheesecake Factory or Olive Garden you could say. It's owned by the same company as Outback.   Cockroaches: my mom pointed out a cockroach right behind me where the planters are. At that point we already paid the bill and just wanted to leave. I told the hostess girls, just to let them know since there were others sitting near. While I was pointing it out I saw another one crawl on to the table and another one crawl up the wall. The girls were really nice and apologetic. They gave us free appetizer vouchers for next time but yeahhhh... don't think there will be a next time. Such a shame cause I like this place but I get shivers thinking about it.",

I forgot her name (yeah I'm terrible) but if she see's this review, you did an amazing job and thank you for everything!  As far as food is concerned, it was outstanding and came out fairly quick. Mom had the rainbow trout with spinach and cheese potatoes, dad had the cod with rice and steamed broccoli and I had the filet with steamed broccoli and garlic potatoes.

The restaurant looks pretty nice inside, with a nice view of the strip. Since our group was large, we had two servers, and they were both great. I don't have any complaints about the service. They were nice, professional, and accommodating.   I ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp for my appetizer, and the Atlantic Salmon w/ Pan Asian sauce, with green beans and potatoes au gratin. The shrimp was very good! The shrimp is fried, with a spicy mayo type sauce. The shrimp was cooked perfectly! The salmon was a little overcooked, as was the green beans. Since the salmon was overcooked, it was a little dry, and the green beans were soft, without much flavor. The potatoes au gratin were not good. It looked more like mac and cheese, with Velveeta cheese, and tasted like it. The Pan Asian sauce was just a salty version of teriyaki sauce, so nothing special. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their entrees, however. I have a brunch planned at the Summerlin location, so we'll see if they are any better.",

Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The rest of our food was executed satisfactorily but overall, I'd rather take my business to a local oyster bar or even Red Lobster.",

The interior featured 'chain-decor:' unimaginative, boxy, and drab. To quote Trump: \"no energy.\" Service was...serviceable. The fish was grilled to perfection, however, the mango salsa flavors had not quite married with sickeningly sweet mango and overpowering onions. The white truffle mac-and-cheese was mediocre. The garlic mashed potatoes were perfect, however the spaghetti squash side was not. The entrees were priced right. Will I remember this meal? Of course not.",

    "text": "My boyfriend an I decided to try this place last night. Let me start by saying it was not a great start. When we got there we were barely greeted by a hostess who looked like she was annoyed that we even entered the restaurant an had to seat us. Then upon trying  to seat us she tried to seat is at a table that was so close to another table you couldn't even pull your chair out without hitting the larger party next to us. An keep in mind there were more tables open that were not in a crowded space. So when we asked for a different table we got the even more annoyed look with sigh an eye roll. Very unprofessional..Once seated our waiter came over who was very nice. He explained everything to us as this was our first time an was very informed on the menu items. We started with the bang bang shrimp as an appetizer as he said it was the most popular an good. It was ok..then after waiting over 45 min  for our dinner an apologies form the waiter our dinner came out which consisted of the Cajun fish tacos an salmon which shouldn't have taken that long. All in all the food was ok.",

The only reason for 4-Star is because the bartender who took care of us first did not know how to make the drink correctly.  I can't remember which drink it was but I usually get the blood orange cocktail and it tasted different from before... The bartender clocked out and another came in and she made it correctly so I guess I will always ask her to make my drinks.",

We had the bang bang shrimp - tasty, crispy, with a perfect sauce on them; the wagyu beef potstickers.  Nice dipping sauce for them.  Also had a cup of the crab and corn chowder.  The bomb!  And the fried Chincoteague oysters with fried dill pickles and a remoulade.  Ya gotta put a bite of oyster and bite of pickle on the fork, dip it into the remoulade and munch.  It's like tartar sauce, but the pickles are on the outside!  Yummy.  We were there during the happy hour 4:30- 6:00.  Noisy, and the wait staff was hopping.  Tough to get their attention for more water and the check.  Oh, and the crushed blackberry  virgin cocktail was refreshing.",

I have consumed this classic in New England proper as well many other spots throughout my culinary adventures. Their version (or the version the chef felt compelled to put their personal spin on) had wasabi in the mixture and it threw off the entire dish completely. Separately, I love these two but a dish should be advertised as \"a take on a classic\" rather than crush the real deal (and my craving for a familiar taste). It's a chain, and sometimes that's what you get. Nonetheless, I think I'll be getting my Lobster Rolls elsewhere moving forward.",

My friends and I decided to celebrate one of our birthdays at the Town Square location. This place was a nightmare from the moment after we were seated.(In all fairness, the hostess was fabulous).  The waitress was aloof and impatient. When we got our dishes, I asked where my garlic mashed potatoes were, and her response was \"The kitchen made an error and put your mashed on her plate\" (pointing to my friend). Um, ok? Then she WALKED AWAY! She did not come back with a sided dish for me. That was her response. I was flabbergasted and disgusted. The food was mediocre and completely different than the wonderful food we experienced in the other location. The Chilean sea bass was dry, the filet mignon was tough,  The manager, Scott came by to ask how everything was and we told him what happened. He was the only good thing that happened in this restaurant. He was absolutely wonderful in turning a \"horrible service evening\" into a tolerable situation. Our waitress never came back expect to basically throw a birthday desert on the table and give us our check. She never offered desert, never apologized, and never came near the table again. I would never step foot in this restaurant again.",

My first time to Bonefish a friend suggested it since we were in the area, so I went with it. To my surprise it is lovely inside, and our service was way above average. Bang bang shrimp seems to be pretty popular there, so I started with that and then had wild salmon with asparagus and jasmine rice for my entree. Our waiter Cameron was very sweet and explained the dishes well. I trusted his description of the salmon and it was very good. The cocktails were alright, I didn't feel that any of their \"special\" drinks looked so incredible, but my companion didn't send his drink back, so he must have enjoyed it. Overall I was quite impressed and I'm wondering why the reviews of the bang bang shrimp aren't better! I would go again with no hesitation",

Keep up all of the good service in this restaurant Marcus.  The only thing I did notice, which was outside of the restaurant:  We arrived a few minutes before the restaurant opened, as we sat in the parking lot watching the employees arrive, they were parking in the prime front row spots.  I think they should be leaving those spots for the patrons.",

Our waiter James was so attentive and obviously an expert with  in food and drinks and an opinion   we loved the ambiance.  My friend had swordfish with pumpkin ravioli and  an apple martini (sessional) and the apple and cinnamon aroma over the table was so wonderful.   The only small negative thing which was no big deal was when you order from the bar it takes forever to get the drink.  The bar was not crowded so we were not sure why we waited so long after we ordered the drink .",

I know some bartenders at other restaurants have issues about transferring tabs from bars to the dining room (I totally get it though I've worked for tips too) but these guys didn't have an issue and I made sure to leave some cash before heading to our table.  Wife had the white sangria and I had scotch and our glasses were never empty.   5/5 Calamari cooked to perfection.  Never had Calamari so soft and breading was just right. The sweet spicy Asian sauce was a nice change from the standard marinara.  5/5 Fontina Chops.  Tender and juicy.  The Marsala sauce wasn't too rich or overwhelming as other sauces.  Spend the extra $5 for the white truffle Mac and cheese.   Wife had the sirloin and crab cake and only had great things to say about it.   Didn't have enough room for dessert this time but on my first trip I remember having the key lime pie and being extremely happy.  Worth the extra 1000 calories   Will be back for sure. Reservations are highly recommended.  Perfect dining ambiance for either family and friends or business clients.  Has a very classy feel without the high prices.",

    "text": "I've wondered about this place for some time. It looked to me like it might be a chain. We went on a tues night for dinner and were given an electronic device that would vibrate and light up when our table was ready. My gut said leave but we stayed. The wait was short and we were taken to a table right at the kitchen opening. There are no doors and we spent our meal watching the staff pick up plates of food and listening to yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't angry yelling but it also wasn't enjoyable. Our waitress was super nice and told us about the menu and emphasized the fresh fish delivered daily and the oak char grilling. We started with crab cakes and a caesar salad. The salad was ok, dressing a little heavy, had an odd flavor, maybe too much dijon? The crab cakes were dry and served with a small dry seedy bit of lemon. (Some sea food restraints have learned to put elastic cloths over lemon halves but i guess not this place.) The crab cakes were ok, a bit  dry, crumbly and bland. not great at all but not so bad to send back, just boring. Entrees were grilled salmon and the grilled scallops with shrimp. The salmon was ok, not bad not great just ok. The scallops had faint grill marks and were cooked through, as were the shrimps. Both seemed a little small and under seasoned and under seared.  For a place that emphasizes their oak wood char grill it was pretty disappointing. The scallops were sadly boring and bland. the grill marks were minimal, char or sear almost non existent and over all presentation and flavor just plain and underwhelming. Sides were adequate - spinach and green beans. Again nothing wrong but nothing stood out as good either. The coconut pie has a weird texture, pretty much shredded coconut without much binder leaving the impression of a coconut hash brown served with a way too sweet Myers's rum sauce. The whole meal was adequate, just ok. Nothing terrible, nothing wrong but also no passion, nothing stood out. It seemed like the work of a C student, it got the job done and not a bit more. I went on line to find out they are indeed a chain with dozens of locations and that explains why the entire meal I felt like I was at a Claim Jumper or a Yard House or an airport.",

Plus I got a Flat Tire, an ice cold bottle that  was only $4.50.  Our total bill was $34.07. The price is just right. The food was pretty good. Service was spot on. We need to join them for Bang Bang Wednesday and get the Bang Bang for 5 bucks. It's lightly beaded shrimp in a light firecracker sauce served on top of a bed of lettuce. It was is not as spicy as they say but  it had a mild favor and fresh tasting shrimp. The house salad came with a Heart of Palm, tomato slices, Romain lettuce and Pumpkin seeds (shelled). Our bartender Will that gave us the real Bonefish story. Go see him for Happy hour. He's a great all around guy, Leave a  good tip. We did.... They treat locals right. More stars to come on a day we have dinner. This was a snack before the movies. PS. They serve Sunday Brunch for less than 20 buck that includes Champagne.",

    "text": "I was very excited to hear about the restaurant  re-opening in Las Vegas. It was a good decent amount of people for a Tuesday night, but not real busy. We decided to sit in the bar area and take advantage of their happy hour specials. When we sat down, the hostess came by with some menus and told us their specials which was great, however it took awhile before a waiter acknowledged that we were there.   We noticed that there were several waiters, standing around and just chatting and they just kept walking by us and didn't say anything. One waitress, that walked by us several times did finally say to us that she apologized for the delay, she didn't know who was our server and that our server did not come in yet and she will be taking our order.  We ordered the steamed mussels and several other items that were on the happy hour menu. Our food came fairly quickly, but no one brought us any silverware. We waited for our waitress to come by so we can ask her, but she never did. My husband finally decided to get it himself and went to the bar to ask for 2 place settings.   I have to say that the food was excellent and delicious as I remembered the first time I ate at this establishment several years ago, when it was in Henderson. I would definitely come back, but wish the service was much better.  I realize they just opened a few months ago and have to work out a few things. It looks like they have a lot of help, but all of them just stand around and talk. They need to work on this.  I would give this restaurant a higher rating if the service was much better.",

The \"crispy\" shrimp lose most of their breading when tossed.. they must make this stuff in huge bowls and dish it out, it's their most popular item. Drinks were good and decently priced. The girl had the special Dynamite shrimp, which was amazing! Great flavor and a ton of shrimp! I had he Filet Mignon and crab cake with the truffle Mac and cheese. The Filet was perfect. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Mac n cheese was amazing! Only reason they are not getting the 5th star is because of the crab cake. It was pitifully small, and lacked seasoning. It could use a few more ounces of crab and flavor. I do recommend this place! Make reservations if you can, since they prefer that. I asked for a table for 2 on a Sunday night, they must of had 6-8 empty tables and still asked if I a reservation..? If I did I think I would have said so.. also the two $$ is a bit deceiving.. I'd go with $$$ if your not going for the 55$ meal for 2. Our waitress was really nice and Overall had great experience!",

I know I ramble...so I thought I'd put my bottom line up top! :)  Anyways, so I had seen Bonefish Grill a few times while driving by Town Square and I'd made a mental note to come back, about 500 times...   Finally...I remembered!  Boy am I glad I did.   I really didn't know what to expect...the restaurant is a new build and seems quite large from the exterior.      While walking up, I noticed a cute little seating area out front, I imagine it would be a nice place to wait when the weather warms.  The front door is a revolving door, SO EXCITED!  What can I say?  I like it. It reminds me very much of New York and gives the restaurant a very cosmopolitan feel.    After going in, I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was just that...a real restaurant.  (I didn't know what to expect...corner bakery style, chipotle style, a super loud Cheesecake Factory style...or what?!  It was none of these!).  We were greeted by a dark wood bar area with ample seating and also high tables for quick sit down dining.  Adjacent to the bar was comfortably lit and serene dining room.  Windows all around, but with shades so you don't feel like you need sunglasses while indoors. (Don't you hate restaurants like that?!)  The hostess was very nice and friendly. We were seated right away in a long booth. Very comfy.  Our waitress greeted us shortly afterwards and since it was our first time (she asked) she went through specials and favorites. I loved her introduction. Sometimes, I find the waiter/waitress (at other places) insincere or uninformed...but out waitress seemed genuine, knowledgable, and interested in us having a good meal.  Ordering was difficult only because I can only eat 1 meal at a time.  :)  Our food came in no time. And I mention this because the dining room was about 75% full with one table that was a large party of about 15.  I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. Salad, onions, corn, black beans, feta...all fresh and delicious. The grilled chicken breast was cut super thin, which I appreciated since it was on a salad. Without me asking, the dressing was on the side. And oh my, their house vinaigrette...LOVE!  I think it's a white cider vinaigrette...but I could be wrong. SO GOOD!!!    My lunch date ordered tilapia tacos...I didn't try them, but she said they were YUMMY!  I decided I had to come back for the sea bass.  I CAN'T WAIT!  See you soon Bonefish Grill!",

We worked through this minor issue, received all of our specified drinks and food. The Mussels Josephine was superb and the Bang Bang Shrimp was a hit. My wife tried the Corn and Lump Crab soup. She wouldn't share so I can only assume it was great. Our guests were duly impressed with the mussels and shrimp along with their entree choices. To top off the meal we shared (okay, I ate more than my fair share) a wonderful Creme Brulee.",

The bang bang shrimp appetizer was highly recommended and good, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype.  I had the Tilapia Imperial and the wife had the sea bass with mango salsa.  Both were good, but the Tilapia was the best.  The au gratin potatoes were good, and the spaghetti squash that came with it was surpringly really good.  Oh yeah - watch out for the pre-meal bread - it's like crack!  We couldn't stop eating it.  Prices weren't too crazy (we had 2 mixed drinks and got out the door under $100), and our meal was great.  Definitely more on the menu I'd like to try.",

My friend and I split the sea bass with mango salsa and the tilapia tacos. The Sea bass was over cooked and the four cheese scalloped potatoes were dry and not impressive. The tacos were okay.

Shrimp was not crispy, sauce needed salt. How disappointing. Dumplings were ok. And where was the bread?? Had to ask for bread. Bread was warm but dipping sauce was olive oil with specks of pesto. Maybe I was expecting more. Onto Chilean sea bass, it was ok. Small serving. Crab cakes were ok. Soft and soggy. Sauce ok. It was just an ok dinner for two that cost $132 with just ok service.",

Thank goodness a friend spotted it before it went into my mouth or would have been catastrophic!!!!*     Other than that- the ahi tunn starter weas delightful, my friends sea bass was not smelly and was very satisfying, the grilled tilapia tacos with mango salsa were fabulous! We never felt rushed and the prices were incredible. Afforable and delighful! Not only all that, Ashley our server was charming and funny and attentive!!!!!

    "text": "This was our 6th visit to the Bonefish Grill.  The 5 previous visits have a 5 star rating from us.  Not sure what happened this time, but we were very disappointed with many things this time.   1) We showed up on a Saturday without a reservation so we were expecting to have to wait and have some cocktails at the bar first.  We were told 20-25 mins. Not bad at all. The reality was that 55 minutes later we were finally seated.  UGH!!!  Hostess was very kind to offer us a free appetizer to make up for the wait though(more to follow on this) 2) Always have had AMAZING food here.  This time TERRIBLE.  Both fish entrees were very under seasoned and had a mushy texture to them.  Rice was dried out and no seasoning at all.  Asparagus and spinach was WAY overcooked and with no flavor at all.  Not sure what happened, as the previous visits the food was the star and second to none.  Maybe new kitchen help? 3) Wait service was the worst ever.  I was going to leave the waitress name, but I thought better of it.  She failed to put our free appetizer order in that the restaurant comped us for the long wait for the table.  We ended up having after our entrees.  VERY long waits in between her checking back on us for drinks or to even see if we needed anything at all.  She came to our table 3 times. Once to take order, once when we requested from another staff member to have her come to our table, because we didn't receive our appetizer, and the last time to bring check.  No thank you or anything.   Once one our favorite restaurants in Vegas, now not so much.",

The last time I asked for some extra salad dressing on the side and it was brought to me when I already was 1/2 way through my main course. I had lobster and was not given any melted butter. Our server knew she didn't bring it and as I waited and waited I finally asked someone else for some butter; because now my lobster was getting cold. Our waitress brought the butter and was put out and confrontational as she asked if I needed more because I was asking her peers to bring me butter. Food was good. Service is not only substandard it is rude. Management was nowhere to be seen. There are too many restaurants in this city with friendly staff to waste your time and money at this Bonefish Grill.",

She was very short and rude with us and seemed to be in a rush, but when I noticed her giving her other tables a lot more attention (primarily white people) I knew she was assuming I wasn't a good tipper or was profiling me because I'm a black women. She barely came by to check on us and was very very short with us. Will never be back. Food was okay, but service left a bad taste in my mouth.

    "text": "I like this restaurant. Fresh seafood entrees that don't break the bank.  Boyfriend and I always order the Bang Bang Shrimp. One of their popular favorite appetizers. Crispy shrimp tossed in a spicy aioli sauce.  For entrees, I usually switch between salmon or Chilean seabass. The outside is seared and the inside got a smooth, buttery and tender. I made sure to specify that I want it well done. Completely cook the sh&t outta it!!!!! I know some restaurants serve their seafood medium. So make sure to specify if you have any special requests. You get to choose two sides; I picked steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin. Yum!!!! Portions were just right. (Didn't have any leftovers, perfect 4 oz. portion. You can choose between 4 or 6 oz seabass. It was either 4 and 6 or 6 and 8). Boyfriend chose his entree from the special menu for the night. He got soft shell crab and really enjoyed it. He got the garlic mashed potatoes as one of his sides and man that was good!!!! Personally, I liked that better than my potatoes au gratin.  Overall, great ambiance, customer service was good and it wasn't an expensive bill. It's healthy....well...healthier than most restaurants and it never disappoints.",

The two appetizers were just so so, too sweet for my taste:  the Calimari and Thai Coconut Shrimp.  As for the main course I picked the grilled Georges Bank Scallop and Shrimp.  The Shrimp was okay.  The Scallop was outstanding (to die for), so soft and tender and just melted in my mouth.  I didn't even use any of the sauces.  Overall, nice ambiance.  Clean.",

    "text": "Came in for 5$ martinis and an appetizer- the bar was the only part of the restaurant with patrons, and the bartender was too busy to give good service (or socializing with a table of cut servers...). They cut a second bartender as we were walking in, and we would have gotten much better service had they stayed. Drink glasses sat empty, dirty dishes in front of everyone around us, and we had to ask for food by getting their attention, whereas normally someone would check in when menus are on the bar to see if we'd like anything. Martini glasses were dirty with water spots and gunk. Ordered calamari, and it was FAR from the quality we are accustomed to. Over seasoned, smaller pieces- disappointing overall for an 11$ dish. With so many options in Vegas, it seems bonefish will no longer be an obvious \"go-to\" in town. Two stars because it generally meets expectations for brand standard. Food and poor management were the issue. Someone should have stepped in and helped the bartender. We would have spent more money with better service, and had anyone asked how everything was while we were there, we could have communicated the issues before leaving.",

For our entrees I decided to order the salmon, garlic whipped mashed potatoes and a side of jasmine rice however my jasmine rice was really hard my whipped garlic mashed potatoes I really loved but my salmon I did not... My salmon tasted like of course it had been on the grill but it had that charcoal taste to it  My friend ordered the fillet mignon butterfly style asparagus and white rice with crabmeat however he loved his rice,  I of course thought it was still hard.. His steak was pretty yummy he really didn't care for it too much tho..  After all being said I don't think I would give this restaurants a second try, however the staff are very friendly and accommodating and the set up on the inside is very gorgeous!!!",

    "text": "This chain located in Town Square (right next door to Texas de Brazil) has been one I have been meaning to check out. I have heard friends and co-workers tell me it is pretty good. I'm always a little hesitant to check out a chain over a locally owned place, but it wasn't half bad.  I came here for a friend's birthday, we were seated in the large, darkly lit dining room. I began my meal with a really great riesling - Chateau Ste Michelle from the Washington valley. A very easy-to-drink, and not overly-sweet riesling.   Next we had appetizers - crab cakes, which were disappointing, small and poorly plated. Served with some sort of sauce I did not partake in.   The ceviche app, however, was pleasing - with large portions of shrimp, scallops, and perhaps some type of white fish? I wasn't sure. However, I did enjoy the sliced fresh jalapenos and chunks of avocado. This ceviche is served with a good portion of chips that are salted.  I had to have their \"bang bang\" shrimp which I have heard rave reviews about. Instead of getting it as the app, I got it in their \"Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos\" - which come out in a set of three with flour tortillas and your choice of sides - I got the kettle-cooked potato chips. Overall I would say \"eh\" to the tacos. I thought they would be more spicy - they were not. Fortunately, the tacos were filled with shrimp, so you get a good portion for $13.50, and the tacos themselves were generously sized.  Lastly we had their macadamia nut brownie, which arrived warm and gooey, with raspberry sauce and scoops of vanilla ice cream. We all shared - and we were all stuffed. But, at the end the management also brought my friend out a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries with some cream and we also had those.  Service was up-beat and management did check on our table. At the end of the meal my water glass was left un-filled, so that was kind of disappointing, but none the less, a small ding against what overall was a good experience.  I would come back, especially since their menu has a lot of seafood items (obviously). I would say good for a party, especially if you have people that are not \"outside the box\" with their food choices, but you would rather go somewhere other than say, Chili's or Applebees.",

The edamame hummus was delicious with the tomatos and pepitas.  I had a bite of the trout and it was really good as were the scalloped potatoes (more casserole than potatoey).   My house salad with chicken was perfect (had brazilian meat service the evening before so this was a great light dish). The dressing was citrusy and light with no cloying aftertaste.   The coconut pie was my favorite. Also tried the pumpkin creme brulee (good, but very pumpkiny!), and the macademia nut brownie (a bit dry for me!).",

    "text": "Hmmmm,  I really liked Bonefish and when I was there entertaining clients at their Orlando Florida restaurant, I was wishing that they had one of these restaurants in Las Vegas.  My dream came True and I am tried this place yesterday with the family.  Overall, I have to give this a weak three star.  Here is the deal, it is both good and bad, I will go back again, just that it was not what I expected.  1.  Let's go with the good stuff first:  a. Ambiance - Very nicely decorated franchise restaurant,  good size bar with Sports on. Very friendly staff and greeters. Very efficient.  b. Availability - I like the fact that I made a reservation 1.5 hours before dinner and was able to get a nice table by the window.  c.  Service - Pretty darn good, very attentive and very willing to please.  d.  Menu - Very large menu, something for everyone.  From seafood appetizers, hamburgers, salads, fish, chops and steaks, dessert, very cool.  Plenty of draft beers and a \"just right\" selection of wine.  2.  Now, let's go with the odd stuff next.  a.  Ambiance - As the sun was setting, why would they lower the lights in the restaurant and open up the window shade that was at our table?  It brought in the oddest, most unpleasant light from the dusk that was not light, but an eerie glow and feeling. It was also odd to have a motorized shade going up while you were eating right next to it.  I don't want dusty bits flying around while I am eating....  b.  Food - We had salmon, seared Ahi Tuna, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Swordfish Oscar, steamed broccoli, steamed asparagus and steamed medley of vegetables.  To me, the sea bass was absolutely wonderfully just okay. It was small, and I ordered the asparagus which cost 2.00 more.  Now I know that asparagus compared to broccoli and string beans is more expensive, but for 5 sprigs of asparagus, I would think 2.00 extra is a bit much.  Also, the sea bass was okay, but what got me was the size.  I am thinking the size was either small, or the plate was way too big.  Perhaps the 5 sprigs asparagus took up too little room?  The grilled salmon was good, I stole a taste from the kids, but I am not sure if they were happy to see a glaze on the salmon. I think it was a miso glaze, but you know, it should be on the menu.  The Ahi Tuna was pretty darn good, just that it looks like a lot because it is presented over rice so it looks like a good portion.   c.  Overall, I find the food was uninspiring and not excitable for me. I would try perhaps the steak or hamburger next time.  Also, some non seafood appetizers would be good for the kiddies.  I will try the place again, just that I need some motivation for this place.  GK says, not bad, if you are in the area.",

Even though our reservations were at 2:15pm, they sat us early and even honored the brunch menu, which ended at 2pm. Our waiter was great. She was accommodating, attentive and friendly. The food was delicious. I had the surf and turf egg benedict, which I highly recommended. The bottomless brunch cocktails were also on point. Looking forward to eating here again.   To the staff at Bonefish, thank you for making our Mother's Day dinning experience awesome! You guys rock.",

Service was terrible...both of our drinks were empty when our fish came and the guy never offered to refill them, not during the meal or even at the end of the meal...  Also, I showed the girl at the front a gift card at \"Roy's\" upon entering the restaurant which is in the same family of restaurants and asked if they accepted it...she said, \"yup, expires 4/30, we take this\".   When the bill came they wouldn't accept it and the manager didn't care what I had been told before we sat down.  That reason on top of the horrible service moves them from a 4/5 star review to 2 stars.",

I asked what was good and she said the shrimp but then said well everything is good....  ok, so I got the crab cakes.... well I guess if you consider those good they have another thing coming to them.... they were both burnt on the bottom and fell into a million pieces when I touched them with my fork. The crab cakes were tasteless besides the burnt bottoms but the sauce was good so I covered them with the amount of sauce I had, I also had a side of spinach that also was tasteless. The server didn't ask how things were till they were good and since I was starving I ate the bigger pieces I could scoop off the plate. My husband ate his fish sandwich but he even said it was just ok.... we ordered the shrimp for a appt but they never showed.. when we asked about them she said oooo I didnt know you wanted them.... so we just said it was fine and we didn't want them still. We won't be going back .... spent $50 bucks on a very disappointing lunch",

Gotta give those a 5/5. Texture and blend on both dishes were delicious!  Now, on to the entree. I ordered the crab cake and sirloin streak. My sides were French fries and garlic mash. (I got the fries cuz that is the only thing my 3 year old will eat there) When my plate arrived my first thought was \"that's it?\" The portions seemed so small! I was waiting to eat something the size of a horse, I was was so hungry! Let me just say, for the steak, it was actually cooked just right. I usually ask for A1 sauce for a little kick but it didn't need it. The crab cake tasted very.... What's the word? Well, crabby. Very very crabby like I was tasting the ocean with it too. Not my favorite but still good. Garlic mash was delightful. You can never go wrong when ordering that. Now.... As for my French fries. I don't know. I never got it. They gave me string beans instead. Which actually, I'm not mad. Maybe the universe was telling me I had too much carbs on my plate. Lol And no I didn't flag down the waitress to have her exchange it for French fries. (I'm not the type to complain unless it was like my incident at the Country Cafe review). At the end of the meal, I was surprisingly satisfied. Not over stuffed, not hungry. I pass by this restaurant all the time, give it a try sometime!",

    "text": "Well unfortunately I wasn't impressed. My friend suggested this place so I took a look @ their menu on line & already knew what I wanted before I even got there. My friend was already there, seated. We had waters on the table to start. Our young waitress cane over & introduced herself (forgot her name) & asked us about drinks & apps. after I had to tell her I couldn't hear her. She had a very soft voice & the place was busy & nosey.  Our cocktails took some time to get to us but they were really pretty & tasted yes yummy! (see pictures). I got the pineapple martini....made with rum not vodka. I asked if bread came with the meal since I saw some at the table next to us & was told yes. The bread was delicious, tasted homemade but the oil & herb dip wasn't so good. Had a odd taste to it. I was soooo hungry I ate it anyways, though it would of been better if I had some butter!   We both got a lobster tail dinner on special $u13.90 & added a lobster tail on $8.00. A tad cheaper then the lobster tails dinner on  the full menu. It was OK, but had this different odd fishy taste to it. Now, now I know lobster is a seafood but I've never had a lobster that tasted so fishy before. Now the menu had a ton of shrimp items in it & also other fish & steak stuff too.  All non-pasta meals come with a side of veggies but all I saw was squash in my veggies. Tastes as if they sprinkled cheese on it....I could of done without the extra calories. We also got to chose a side. I picked the potato au-gratin which wasnt very tasty or good!   We waited too long for out checks after our table was cleared too...... I don't like the set up inside. The tables were all to close to each other. No room for a private conversation, or to hang your purse on the corner of the chair without someone knocking into it or worrying if someone People had to walk almost sideways to get by & through the dinner room. It's as if they were trying to  squeeze more tables then they could by putting all the tables so close. Not sure if I will go back!",

We were not disappointed.   Loved this place! The fish wasn't fishy at all, cooked just right and the whipped potatoes were perfect. Garbanzo beans were the veggie of the evening, even those were delicious! Manhattan wasn't anything to write home about but the happy hour is pretty reasonable. Our server was josh I believe? He was knowledgeable, helpful and persuasive. He definitely made our evening enjoyable!  Happy hour ends at 630 I believe?

We had originally planned to eat at Flemings because we had a gift card, but upon our arrival we discover that they are only serving by invitation because they didn't officially open until Friday.  But the valet out front pointed us to Bonefish because it's part of the same restaurant group and we would be able to use our gift card there as well.  I am really glad we took his suggestion.  We were just in time for happy hour and the cool thing is they allow you to sit anywhere in the restaurant as opposed to most places that limit seating to the bar area for happy hour.    Service was a little lacking but they were a little busy.  Other than that, our food was really good, the happy hour menu had some good choices but we actually only had the bang bang taco off the list and enjoyed a few things off the regular menu because they sounded so good.  So overall, I would return, and try a few of the other appetizing items on the menu.",

    "text": "Had a pleasant evening here with some friends for dinner.    Let's start with the food~  We started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp Appetizer for the table.  There was a enough for 4 of us to share for a starter.  They were delicious! Had a great creamy and spicy flavor.   I could have probably ordered just that for my entree.  But since it was our first time here, I kept truckin on...  The fresh bread was delivered to the table with dipping oil and seasonings.  This was also pretty great .  The bread was warm with the great flavor of the dipping oil.  My stomach was filling up fast but I'm still going to power through.  :-)  I ordered the Longfin Tilapia Imperial.  It took a little while for our meals to be delivered but mine was worth a little wait.  It was stuffed with shrimp, crab, scallops and cheese with a great butter flavor and seasoning.  I chose to accompany my fish with the steamed broccoli.  I might as well have part of my meal to be healthy right? The broccoli was perfectly steamed with a seasoning that did not over power any flavor.  If I was judging my dining experience alone... it would have been at least 4 stars but I was not there alone.  Why only three stars?  Our waitress was pleasant when we saw her, but few and far between.  She messed up a friends drink order, twice.  But this could be overlooked if she had acknowledged her mistake. She rarely came back to our table to check on how our meals were and let our drinks go dry a few times.    My husband and friends steak was over done.  I realize we are at a seafood restaurant but if steak is offered, know how to prepare it as requested.  Our friend sent his back but my husband ate his as he doesn't send food back.  We've all seen the movie Waiting... right?    I'm hoping to come back here since I loved their bang bang shrimp.  Keeping my fingers crossed for better service and meal for the hubby.  Happy that we were there with great company!",

She got chocolate strawberries and a coupon for bang bang shrimp on her next visit. Most of my friends recommend the blackberry sangria. It wasn't busy as we thought it would be when we went around 12. The endless bubble brunch is $20. It's also in Town Square, so you'll be able to shop around after. I got an omelette, which was good. I haven't ever had a bad omelette anywhere, and I'm not picky. The only thing I wish they did was to ask my friends who got a burger how they wanted it. They got it rare, and she didn't feel like eating after. They split our checks accordingly. We were in and out of there for as long we wanted to be.",

We had to wait and wait for our server to come back and see how the food was and then waited another half and hour to get a new entree that was actually warm.   I have been a server before and understood that everyone has an off night so we gave it a try again today January 21 because the reviews were so good.  We sat at the bar and not only did we wait over 15 minutes to even get water both our food came out cold.  No one came and checked on us.  When we explained the situation there was no apology or anything and we then waited again for warm food and again no one addressed refilled our drinks in the meantime or anything.  Overall it was a waste of a Sunday afternoon brunch that took over two hours and was terrible food and service.  We will never be back or recommend this establishment to anyone!!!!",

    "text": "Mediocre Food, Good Service, Presentable Restaurant, Basically an Upscale Red Lobster  Pros:  Service, Clean Cons:  Food is sub par  My wife and I dined at Bonefish Grill last Monday.  While we found the server very friendly and attentive, the food was mediocre and sub par.    Apps (Wagyu Beef + Ginger Potstickers / Wedge Salad)  The potstickers were really unmemorable.  I wouldn't say that they are bad, but I wouldn't say that they are better than frozen ones you can get at Trader Joes.  For the \"wagyu\" beef, it really didn't taste like anything, which made me believe that they were frozen or likely prepared at a central commissary.  As for the salad, it was good, but slightly under dressed.  I wondered if the server is the one who prepares the salad.  If so, then the salad will probably be inconsistent depending on who makes it.  Entrees (Georges Bank Scallops & Shrimp, Caribbean-Style Fresh Cobia)  Starting with the good, the cobia was excellent.  I would order this again, but since I'm never going back to Bonefish, I'll just order it when I go to RM Seafood.  The garnish on this dish was notable since it was so much superior to the garnish on the Georges dish.  First, the scallops were simply insipid with a strange texture.  Second, the accompanying shrimp were the same, except that the shrimp with the cobia was much tastier and seasoned better.  Third, the salsa on this dish was strange in that it was mushy and felt like it was overcooked (not that I've had a cooked salsa before).    Dessert (Chocolate Lava Cake)  This is not a lava cake.  It is a bundt cake that is covered and filled with strange tasting chocolate.    Anyway, if you're the type of person who likes the Cracker Barrel, you'll probably be impressed with Bonefish Grill.  However, I would rather just go to Yardhouse since the seafood there is better than Bonefish Grill.  You could also go to Todd's Unique Dining.  If I wanted something more expensive, I would go to RM Seafood, Maestro's Ocean Club, or Milos.",

Dinner: All of their fish is amazing but we usually get a seasonal special. Tonight we split the swordfish topped with crab and served with pumpkin ravioli. With the appetizer it was more than enough to share.   Our drinks were always fresh and we were checked on frequently.

Chicken moist and salmon seared/cooked to perfection and paired wonderfully with the extra avocado... But the reason why this review is missing a star is because I wish the Salmon portion was bigger and the service was pretty slow... What initially was supposed to be a quick bite turned into at least 45 minutes to an hour. Despite that though, I'm glad we ate at Bonefish Grill because I had always been curious!",

She was friendly and welcoming. Our waiter arrived shortly after to take drink orders and he was also friendly. Our service was good overall and they were quick enough to be a good lunch hour option.  The lunch menu had some nice options with reasonable lunch prices. My boss and I both opted for the lunch combination of two tacos (one filet mignon and one fish) with crab and corn chowder. I liked the flavor of both tacos. The meat and fish were both well prepared. The tortillas weren't as soft as I prefer and that threw off my overall enjoyment of the tacos a bit. The chowder was fine, but not nothing to write home about.",

Dinner was my first meal of the day.  The restaurant was packed. We had reservations for 7:30pm. There was still a wait and that's when I told my husband that this is the reason we don't go out on Vday. Anywho, we waited about 15 minutes and my husband got the text. The hostess seated us. Jon was our waiter, and quickly gave us water and soon some bread. I ordered a martini which tasted wonderful. We ordered some appetizers and quickly came out. We were so hungry he came with another bread.  Lol. Then our entree came and surprisingly ate it all.   I will definitely come back, and maybe for Happy Hour. Thank you Bonefish Grill and Jon for making our Valentines Dinner special. Probably be back for next year.",

I was wondering how I could rack up $50 on two simple drinks, but assumed that the wine was made with napa valley gold or something.    After seeing the bill at home, and the $30 error, I called to see if I could have it fixed.  The manager knew what it was about right away, and apologized for the error, comped the bill and apologized again.   Kudo's for solving this before I had to question the options when I called.    +good parking +lots of seating at bar on crowded night +better than average beverage selection for chain seafood place - not one up in NW location yet.",

She has a high-pitched voice you wouldn't be able to miss her.  Ordered the Thai chili prawns for an appetizer. It was OK. I'm not sure if it was the manager put them on our table. But when she brought them out, she had a mad look on her face like she hated her job. She had long hair a little bit colorful. Personality not so colorful. Not enough sauce. And it looks like they decorated it with cilantro.   Ordered an omelette and it was sick. Had to cover it with a napkin.Tasted like something I would order from Denny's. Considering this place was triple the price. Ordered the burger with the egg. It just wasn't good. Sauteed spinach was good. Ate that instead of the burger.  Left having a buzz from all the mimosas.

We were so upset, we looked around and everyone there had at least a couple drinks on the table. We didn't even get anyone worker saying hello. After 20 minutes we decided to leave. Obviously you all didn't want our service there so we went somewhere else. I did go up to the host and let him know why we were leaving. This is unacceptable and extremely bad customer service. If you run a business you need you make sure you have workers that want to work there. Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else in the future.",

    "text": "*brunch review* Came here for my first time this past Sunday!! So brunch is only available sundays here, their brunch menu is pretty small but tasty nonetheless! They have a deal which is $20, which includes bottomless bellinis, mimosas, and bloody Mary's, AND select breakfast items!! That's a pretty good deal considering some places charge $15 alone for drinks. Their drinks also come in a lot of flavors as well. I ordered the surf and turf eggs Benedict on English muffin, which come with a side of potatoes or seasoned veggies. It was super good! Came with one English muffin split in half, so it was two of the eggs Benedict pieces and it was really good!! I'll be back",

    "text": "I went here for a birthday party with a big group of friends, and as a tourist of Vegas I was hopeful that the place was going to be delicious. I was wrong. I ordered the fish and chips which was about $17 and for that amount I considered the portion size to be rather small. It only came with 3 cod fish Sticks and a half handful of fries. WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Secondly, if you're in a budget and don't like eggs, don't go here because everything on the cheaper end of the menu was served with eggs on top. Which I'm sure you could take off but it would ruin the dish! Third of all, the customer service was horrendous, I felt like myself and the group of girls I was with weren't welcomed there and that they couldn't wait for us to leave. I ordered bottomless mimosas while other girls at my table ordered bottomless drinks as well and we had to keep asking the waitress back to our table rather than her walking by to see if we needed any refills. It took a while to get the food and one of my friends ordered food but her plate never came. So you pay high prices for very small portions and crap service. So if you want that from what is supposed to be a \"higher class restaurant\" then this is the place for you ! I'm not sure if my experience was bad because I was with a group, but I feel like service should always be great no matter what .... especially when you have experience in the food industry !  And to add insult to injury... we had to ask for our checks which took 20 minutes to print, then they were gone for another 20 minutes with everyone's credit/debit cards which is an uncomfortable feeling.   If I were the hiring manager... I would fire that blonde women, her customer service and her aura were uncomfortable for myself and my table. And it was her that made us feel like we had to leave as soon as we were done eating. If you don't want to be in the restaurant business... no one is making you stay .",

    "text": "I haven't been to any Bonefish Grill location, so I was excited to try this new eatery in Town Square. My visit last August was pleasant with just minor hiccups. I spoke well of them and planned on returning. Six months later, my dining experience was just okay -- not bad, but nothing spectacular.  By no surprise, I was really taken by their Bang Bang Shrimp ($10.90) -- fried shrimp tossed in a deliciously creamy and spicy sauce. It's their signature dish (complete with trademarked name) and there's a reason they build all their marketing around it. The appetizer, however, wasn't as good the second time around. I'm not sure if it was just the preparation that evening or if that's just how it's served now. They also offer their prized shrimp in tacos and for $5 on \"Bang Wednesdays\" (4pm-closing).  Other appetizers: Twisted Edamame Hummus ($5.50) -- topped with roasted tomatoes, pepitas, and served with crispy flatbread chips and Wagyu Beef and Ginger Dumplings ($9.30) -- pan-seared with crispy onions, Thai peppers, and soy sauce. The hummus was all right, but the dumplings were pretty good.  During my first visit, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass ($29.90) with Chimichurri sauce (no longer offered) with two sides: Chorizo, Edamame, and Corn Slaw and Red Quinoa Salad. The entrees come with a seasonal vegetable and additional choice of side, however, I requested another side in lieu of the vegetables and paid an extra dollar. The fish was exquisite. All their fish are grilled over their wood and it was delicious. It was a really nice size for the price as well. The Chimichurri wasn't very good though. I really liked the slaw topping, but the quinoa salad was flavorless.   Ruben and I shared the Baja Fish Tacos ($14.10) during my most recent visit. It's made with grilled Tilapia, flour tortillas, mango salsa, lime crema, shredded lettuce, and served with housemade chips. The fish was good, but I didn't enjoy anything else. I'm not a fan of the use of flour tortillas for tacos, I didn't care for the mango salsa, and the lime crema didn't add enough pizzazz. The housemade chips were okay, but had no flavor.  For beverages, my friend and I shared a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc: \"Attitude\" by Pascal Jolivet, France ($36) and I also tried their Signature Pomegranate Mango Red Sangria ($5.50). Both were really great selections. They also have a white sparkling sangria, but the server suggested the red.  Desserts: As a recommendation from our server, we tried the Jamaican Coconut Pie with Rum Sauce (no longer available). It was a warm coconut pie (well, ours was improperly reheated) with very strong rum sauce. Not very good. I also tried their Creme Brulee featuring Madagascan vanilla custard served with fresh seasonal berries and whipped cream ($7.30) and Chocolate Creme Brulee - decadent and creamy chocolate custard made with a hint of Grand Marnier and housemade whipped cream ($7.30). The Creme Brulees are definitely good. I really like that they used Madagascan Vanilla since it has a more robust flavor and the Chocolate version was delicious! That splash of Grand Marnier really made it.  Service has been odd. Both times, the servers have been really nice, but there's been disconnect between the servers and the kitchen or something. The servers would disappear for long periods of time, but otherwise would be very attentive. One of our friends didn't receive his pre-dinner course prior to our entrees, but the server was nice enough to remove it from our bill. It was still difficult for him to enjoy though. Also, there was absolutely no timing between appetizers and entrees. The complimentary bread is delicious, but it wasn't offered the first time.  I do like the ambiance and decor, but it seems to have identity issues. The decor, menu, and prices portray a nice \"date night\" dining establishment, whereas the butcher paper, vinyl tablecloths, and heavily fried menu feel like your typical casual dine-in restaurant (without the benefit of cheap prices). For the most part, the food quality seems (slightly) better, but not sure if it's worth it.",

They had a special for $50 for two which included the bang bang shrimp,  a choice of about 6 entrees and a dessert to share. The bang bang shrimp was delicious.  The shrimp is crunchy and covered with a slightly spicy sauce. It is served on a bed of lettuce. There are a lot of shrimp!   Hubby had the lobster stuffed shrimp with creamed spinach. I had the rockafeller cobia. I had not heard of this fish and the server described it perfectly. It was to die for! So flavorful! I had it with green beans and jasmine rice.   We shared a HUGE strawberry shortcake for dessert.  I was stuffed and brought home about 1/3 of my dinner.  (I needed to save room for dessert,  right? )  Our server,  Joe,  was fantastic. When we told him it was our first time there,  he explained the menu and gave us his recommendations. When we told him we would definitely be back, he said he had been there since they opened so he would probably see us again.   All in all, a great dining experience.",

    "text": "I want to group Olive garden, cheese cake factory and bonefish grille etc. into the same categories of resturants. Probably not very exciting due the standard menu, but you would expect reasonably good food and decent service. But based on my recent experience, I do not think I will go back any time soon. My review is based primarily on the quality of the food and one problem with the service.   I went to Bonefish Grille a couple years ago at another location and I remembered liking the Bang Bang shrimp, but not like my entree back then.   When I was here tonight, I was surprised to find the Bang Bang shrimp is $13 or something like that, quite a price jump from my memory. I ordered the sea bass with Asian sauce and it comes with seasonal vegetable and I can choose another side. I chose the couscous. It turns out to be a major disappointment. The fish recipe is not well designed in the first place and I think the execution is poor as well.   In my opinion, Chilean sea bass is very good fish. It taste good by itself and it is really hard to screw up. But somehow Bonefish made it happen. The only good thing is the fish is still tender and juicy (as I said the fish is very forgiving).   The first problem is the sauce is awful and it totally overpowers the delicate fish. The sauce is labeled as pan Asian sauce, but it tastes somewhat sweet with a tomato undertone. So it tastes like a cheap generic sweet and sour sauce. Diluted soy sauce or salt/pepper would probably be much better. When the food itself is good, the recipe should be simple to show-case the food material itself. There are also some shredded carrots on top of the fish. They are totally unnecessary and so out of place. Who on earth wants sweet and sour fish with carrots? Why on earth call it Asian sauce? I do not know any Asian cuisine cook delicate fish in sweet sour sauce with carrots.  The second problem is the outer surface of the fish steak is burnt. I understand the fish is probably seared in the pan first and then baked or grilled. But apparently the temperature of the pan is too high. The fish surface can be slightly crispy, golden brown, but not bitter and burnt. So I think it is not executed well.   Thirdly, the menu says the dish comes with a side of seasonal vegetable and it turns out to be Garbanzo beans. I would not consider them to be seasonal and when I think of vegetables, I generally do not think of Garbanzo beans either. It tastes ok. But if you would like fresh vegetables (i.e., broccoli, zucchini, asparagus etc.) like I do, please ask the waiter what the seasonal vegetable actually is. Make no assumptions.   Lastly, the bathroom is out of towel paper and there is no hand drying equipment either. I think it is a negligence of the management.   With all above being said, our waitress is attentive and friendly. The ambience is comfortable and trendy. If you are not very concerned with the food taste and would rather choose familiarity from the chains (i.e., the food and the ambiance), I think this may still be a good place.",

My biggest complaint is the floors were slippery and our daughter fell. We told the waitress who was serving people next to us. She called the hostess to help clean it. Hostess grabs a table napkin and wiped the floor down using her foot. The other hostess grabbed mop. Still sticky. Meanwhile, a manager was loudly talking to people next to us saying she lives in summerlin and she's opened several bone fish in Cal and nv. Male manager comes by and sees the mop and waitress told him it was slippery. He smiled at us and walked away. As were leaving we told the male manager that our daughter has fallen twice and he smiled and said he knows it's slippery. I don't know if management has changed but we won't be returning.",

The fish and chips that my husband got was pretty decent but compared to the bang bang shrimp, it was rather bland. Very reasonable prices and comfortable ambiance.   Would definitely recommend!",

I'll tell you though. There's a delicious appetizer there called Bang Bang Shrimp. Now the waiter told me it's 1/2 off on Wednesdays. \"Fantastic, so on Wednesdays I can order that take out?\" I said. \"Absolutely\" he replied. Sounds good right? Wednesday rolls around and I'm craving shrimp. So I call to place a to go order and the woman who picked up informed me that you have to buy an entree with it. I explained that wasn't what her own staff told me. She didn't care. Left a bad taste in my mouth and lost a potentially loyal and regular customer.",

He took it off our bill without any requests from us, so we were quite pleasantly surprised.  We had the mahi mahi and sea bass, with lemon butter sauce on the side.  Both were perfectly cooked and delicious even without any sauces.  The sides were well done and decent too.  We had truffle Mac and cheese, steamed broccoli, potatoes au gratin, Caesar salad, corn and crab chowder.  It was all well prepared and tasty.  We'll be back for more.",

When we arrived they did not have our reservation so they gave us their private room which was nice (without charge I might add). The food was delicious, the service was a little slow but really considering that they probably were not prepared since they did not write down the reservation, the wait staff did well. I also want to thank the manager who did take care of the mistake and treated us well. Many of our lunch group members had not been there before and said they would go again.  A very pleasant experience. I would also go again. My only other complaint is that they do not have clam chowder. I am always surprised when I go to Bonefish and they tell me that. They only have corn chowder. This is the only restaurant that serves fish that does not have any clam chowder in Las Vegas. Oh well.",

The shrimp comes out but the crab cakes doesn't and had to wait longer for them because they waitress forgot to order it. Then I ordered the Caribbean Cobia special while pointing to it on the special sheet which was supposed to come with coconut, grilled pineapple grilled shrimp and pineapple salsa, my meal came with none of that just the fish and two sides I ordered. We also ordered two house salads and never got those either until the middle of our meal after saying anything. I usually love bonefish but this kinda service is unacceptable.. how could all those things be forgotten in one visit?!",

My husband had the lamb and enjoyed it immensely!  A couple of my kids had the burgers and loved them!  My daughter really disliked the fish tacos.  She said they were way too sweet as they were covered in mango salsa.  So, Bernadette got her something else that she loved!  The Bang Bang shrimp tacos!  Bang Bang shrimp was the highlight of our dinner!  I did not care for the crab cakes.  They were a bit soggy and I prefer mine with a nice crunchy outside.  I would also stay away from the chicken sandwich.  It was burnt, had very little chicken and the flavor was overpowered by too much spinach.  The service and Bang Bang shrimp is enough to bring me back!",

The events manager, Andy was great. Their policy for group reservations was really flexible, as well. We only needed to give a final headcount 2 days ahead (we gave a ballpark when we booked) and people could choose that day from among the 3 entree options we selected when we booked. No having to get people to RSVP to us with their meal choices - heaven for a wedding! We even had 2 vegetarians in the party and they could select from among a few vegetarian options at no extra charge. The group events menus they have start at very reasonable prices - less than other options in Town Square we had considered using.   They let us use the projector screen in the room, which we used to put up a slideshow of combined family photos that my mom made. That was a great addition to the meal. Everyone was happy with their food, and the waitstaff made serving and clearing smooth.   Thanks!",

I once ordered a plate of fried calamari as a starter. For some reason, our calamari came with small pieces of shrimp mixed in. Being allergic to shrimp, this was unacceptable. We alerted the waiter. Not only did the waiter take the plate back immediately, but the manager came out, apologized profusely, brought out some fresh calamari with no shrimp in it, and comped our drinks. The manager continued to check up on us that night and made sure the rest of our night was perfect.  As far as entrees go, the Spinach Bacon Gorgonzola Swordfish is a must try here (whenever they have it, as it is only on special during certain parts of the year). Absolutely splendid use of Gorgonzola cheese cheese on fish.The bacon bits give the swordfish just a tiny bit of a crunch that make the meal that much more enjoyable. I have ordered this several times and it is definitely one of the best swordfish plates I have ever had.",

    "text": "Just speaking from my experience, this seems to be another chain restaurant like any other Applebee's or Chili's. I'm solely basing this on non fish items.  When we first arrived, we were greeted and informed that a table or booth would be about a 20-25 minute wait, which is not bad at all, or we could sit down immediately at the bar area or at some communal tables. We decided to sit at one of the communal tables and we're quickly given a menu and ordered some water. The menu had a majority of grilled fish or shrimp as entrees. We opted to skip this and order other items as I always like to see what else chefs are putting out, in my experience, if you're specializing in one protein but have other items as well, the other items tend to lack.   To start we ordered a Lobster Bisque. When it came out, it looked very promising. The color of the bisque was very vibrant, there was a reasonable chunk of lobster meat centered on top. The flavor was delcisous but was a bit thick in my opinion to be a bisque. The consistency was that of a gravy, it could've and should've been a  it looser. Entrees ordered were the Baja Shrimp Tacos, Basil Fettuccine and Truffle Mac and Cheese. Drinks ordered were a BlackBerry Smash and Raspberry Iced Tea. Our drinks arrived in about 15 min, a bit long, but seeing as covers were high for the night I did not mind. I did notice that there servers were wearing chefs coats, or are they actually the chefs serving you?? I was a bit confused. I did see 2 people who seemed like chefs come out and give people their plates but, came out of the kitchen with their aprons on. From my schooling, I remember that this is a big no no! Anywho, back to the food! All the food arrived at the same time, under 20 minutes which was good. The reason it was not a bad wait is, one of the servers was walking around handing out free samples of their Bang Bang Shrimp. Nice touch. These are battered, fried shrimp covered in a sauce. It almost reminded me of orange chicken from a Chinese restaurant.   The tacos ordered were good. The bang bang shrimp were used for this. It included some cabbage slaw and a mango salsa with a fried \"tortilla\". Not really a tortilla of course, more like a thin fried dough. Next! The fettuccine looked great so I was anxious to dig in. I was disappointed when I put my fork in the pasta, I got a huge lump of pasta. All of it seemed to be stuck together as if sitting in my plate for some time after served. I literally had to use a spoon as well to tear apart the big chunks. Oh, and did I mention I got a BASIL fettuccine, where's the basil??? I had more artichoke hearts and grape tomatoes, just call it what it is! The mac and cheese, if I could call it that. Presentation was nice, served in an oval shaped ramican, the mac was topped with crunchy panko crumbs. Mac was in a white cheese sauce with mushrooms and truffle oil. First off, the sauce they tried to pass off as a cheese sauce seemed to be a thickened bechamel sauce. Where's the cheese??! I dug deeper into the dish and noticed that the bottom of the ramican was lined with mushrooms. Seemed like I was served half mushroom and half mac. The blackberry smash I ordered was nothing special either. Blackberrys muddled with lemon then served with water and a bit of sugar. That's exactly what it tasted like! Did I mention that the plates being used were extremely hot! So hot, that on two different occasions servers had to put plates down on our table on their way to their destinations because their hands couldn't handle the heat, even though some had cloths to hold the plates. One guest to my right did not seem too happy when he had to send back his steak because of it being the wrong temperature. His friends were waiting to start because of this mistake. Their party of 3 arrived before us, and we left first.   Is it bad to say that I left this place still hungry? I'm not attempting to discredit anyone, I'm must hoping that this place can improve as I had been looking forward to tasting the food here for some time.",

    "text": "I'd put a 4.5 star rating if it was available.  The knocked off half star would be because out of 5 visits or more, one time the pecan crusted trout came out under cooked and bland. I did arrive a bit late and I believe the kitchen was trying to close. I don't feel like a 945pm arrival time for 1030pm closing is that bad. maybe they were trying to close early due to a slow turn out.  Every item I've had here is yummy. Yesterday I came here and got the $36 alaskan king crab legs. They were very yummy (not the best I've had, but a damn steal for that price!)  The ambiance is great for a date.  Some wet naps would of been really nice after the crab legs, but oh well, i don't knock off points there.  I love the arnold palmer. I think the lemonade is their restaurant recipe, and it really gives a great after taste with the arnold palmer.",
