The rotary is on one side only and the other half of the restaurant is iPad ordering only. We waited 15 minutes after opening for a table. Not bad at all. The rolls and nigiri are great! I really appreciate the choices of Toro, ama ebi, and the extra kitchen dishes we can grab off the iPad menus.   We will definitely be back! Ann was our server and was THE BEST. Seriously great service.",

    "text": "I just returned from my first trip here and have mixed thoughts. On one hand, it's a cool experience. On the other hand, I wasn't impressed by the food.  The idea is super cool and interactive. If you have kids, I can see this being a hit! The sushi is portioned out in 2-3 pieces per plate and are labeled as they pass along on the conveyor belt. It's $2.50 per plate which is pretty affordable. There are a few speciality items that can be ordered via the tablet on the table and arrive at your table via a robotic tray.  The food is really nothing to write home about, ironically. Out of the 15 or so different types of sushi available, the only plate that sticks out is the popcorn lobster. All of the others seem basic or standard.   The topic of freshness is debatable. You can see the chefs preparing the sushi and placing the plates on the conveyor belts. At the same time, the same plate is seaweed salad passed me by the entire duration of my meal. Granted, that just means no one wanted it. But in the same breath, if someone arrived towards the end of my meal and choose that salad, by then it's far from fresh.   Tip: a table closer to the beginning of the conveyor belt means you'll get the best pick of whatever has been put out. If you're closer to the end ,like the table I was at , you'll have whatever everyone else didn't want. There may be 2 or 3 rotations before the plate you want becomes available.  Insight: the more the merrier but the higher the bill. If everyone is on a mission to get full, you'll go through a lot of plates. And plates = money. But for a date, the two of you could eat for less than the price of one person at an all you can eat spot.",

The restaurant has a contemporary/ modern setting and you can also order other dishes via iPad that's stationed at every booth.  Not everything on the iPad menu is on the conveyor belt, but definitely has variety of rolls & sushi ...enough to satisfy our sushi cravings. I also want to highlight that their rolls don't have a lot of rice which I looove and appreciate! :)  Staff was also great! Definitely a must for me to come too whenever I'm in town.",

Sushi was good but the udon was a little sweet for us. Most of the nigiri is $2.50. Everything adds up so if you are hungry and want to eat a lot, be prepare to spend more than all you can eat price. The iPad would shut off if you don't order or touch it for a few minutes. That's probably something they can fix because it should always be on. It's newly open so they have time to fix all the kinks. Overall, I would come here when I want to snack on some sushi.",

Came here for dinner on a Friday night. The place was CROWDED and there was a large line but it moves very quick. Each dish on the revolving belt is $2.50 each. I usually saw either 1-2 nigeri or 4 simple rolls to each dish. There is an iPad at each table where you can order specific appetizers, sushi, or specialty rolls. The items you order come to you on a robotic cart on top of the revolving belt. It's actually pretty cool. The food here is really good, I'm not a fan of uni nigiri (sea urchin) but it was really good here. I also enjoyed the soft shell crab. Overall, I had a great experience here and it's probably one of my favorite places to get sushi now in Las Vegas. Will definitely be back some day.",

I stopped by around 3:30PM after hiking for like 5 hours in Utah and driving 4 hours to Vegas.  I was extremely hungry by the time I arrived and an unanticipated benefit of eating here was that there's food ready to eat on the revolving tracks!  I ended up having 6 of the plates and placing 11 other sushi/appetizer orders on the iPad.  The sushi is very good and the food comes fast.  Although I do have some concerns about the sushi that is traveling around for long periods of time when there's less foot traffic (I saw some of the same plates going around for at least 30 minutes), not sure if they are somehow refrigerated/cooled when going around on the conveyor for so long.",

I tend do drink a lot of water during meals, but my glass was never empty and when the our iPad stopped working, the host was over right away to fix it.   Not only that, but for a sushi bar like this, the quality of the fish not terrible. In fact, the salmon quality is very comparable to some sushi bars. The tuna, however was quite fishy. Some recommendations are the smoke salmon, salmon belly, the squid, the spider hand roll, and if you want to be adventurous, their mini tacos aren't bad either.",

After the novelty of the conveyer belt and the delivery \"tray\" for the specially ordered kitchen items wears off, there was really nothing about the place I would come back to check it out.  Service was prompt and friendly. That's the only thing that the place has going for them. You get charged by the plate which is $2.50 (*edited pricing*) unless otherwise noted. Waters were refilled on a timely manner. The cons outweigh the pros:  1. They do not carry natto (fermented soybeans).   2. The ordering tablet doesn't allow you to make special requests from what I've seen unless I was completely blind.  3. The skin on branzino with the orange puree looks pretty on the tablet but fails upon delivery. Skin was not crispy at all. The carrot puree underneath was lacking seasoning, however, the sweetness of the carrot came through.   4. Some of the sushi on the conveyer belt had dried out edges to it. Some of the \"higher\" priced items like salmon belly looked iffy.  5. Limited dessert selection.  If you want to try it out, come for the novelty. Prices does get out of control if you don't watch it. It averaged out to about $30 for 3 people, so basically stick to your AYCE spots unless you're here to entertain friends.",

There is still a waiter assigned to you to help you with things such as drinks, to-go orders, and any confusion you may have with the process.   As a vegan, there were very limited options. They do offer a cucumber roll and an avocado roll, but that's the extent of the veggie sushi. I'd like to see them add some more vegetable rolls in the future. They do offer miso soup and white rice as well for very low prices. You can ask your server for sauces, such as garlic ponzu, to put on your side of rice. They also offered a variety of ramen and udon noodles, but I did not have the chance to ask if they were (or could be prepared) vegan.   The person I went with was not a vegan, and was very impressed by he quality of the food. You can see the chefs in the kitchen preparing fresh sushi as you sit which he really enjoyed.   The price of everything at the end was extremely reasonable. For three people to eat until completely full, with sake and beer, our totally tallied up to $100.",

    "text": "This is probably the most fun you'll have at a sushi restaurant.  Conveyor belt sushi is something I have always wanted to experience since I saw it on an episode of Lonely Planet about 20 years ago.  The thing is when you have 50-100 pieces revolving around at room temperature you're not guaranteed a fresh piece every time; it's not really about the quality here as much as it is about the gimmick.  But, anyway, staff is very friendly, very accommodating, and the environment her is very positive.  Also the pepper tuna is absolutely nasty; its like licking the steel on a WWII battleship.  Edit: from a comment from the owners, the plates are RFID tracked for freshness, which is refreshing to know. Just a tip to the restaurant, it would be comforting for the staff to inform their customers of this when we sit down.",

We were newbies and no one spent any time explaining it to us, but the items on the revolving belt are all the same price. The fun part though is when you order from the iPads on the table. It comes on a little sushi train, starts blinking for you to grab it and then scoots back to the kitchen after you press the button. Needless to say, our night was filled with orders from that thing because the kids were having so much fun.   As for the food, their shrimp tempura was delicious and their black garlic ramen and udon were really tasty. One order filled up one of my kids. Edamame is a bit salty, but you can always scrape that off. The shrimp tempura roll has a thick coat of teriyaki sauce on it which made it a bit too sweet. But the spider hand rolls were delicious and the other rolls were delicious and a great portion size so we really enjoyed our meal. Will definitely be back!  Note: the bathrooms are nice but aren't that clean when it's busy. It's one bathroom per gender. Also try to go during off times to avoid the crowds!",

At other places waiters tend to be kind of rude when we tell them if her allergy. Ivan didn't make us feel like a burden at any point! They had her food prepared specially in the back, whilst Tim cooked the rest of the party's food. He was incredibly entertaining rivaling Benihana's staff easily! The food tasted incredible and I don't see any point in going to the strip to eat Benihana's after today. The restaurant is broken up into two parts, a rotating sushi bar area and the steakhouse area. We were able to sit down almost immediately even though there was a line by going to the steakhouse tables (like Benihana tables), the only catch is someone has to order something from the menu for that area. Easy because the price of the food is significantly cheaper than Benihana's but the taste is just as good! You can't go wrong eating here!",

Some food, like the tasty BLACK GARLIC RAMEN will be brought out by your server, who also takes your drink order at the beginning. However, we ordered FILET MIGNON NIGIRI and UNAGI NIGIRI (both fabulous), and those arrived via a little table-car-robot thing that rides along a track above the sushi belt and knows what table to stop at and sings to you while you retrieve your tasty selections from it. The FATTY SALMON NIGIRI was my favorite thing from the belt and I had a bottle of NIGORI SAKE (my favorite, it's unfiltered, white and milky in texture, a little sweet and you drink it chilled). Service was great. Nothing we tried was bad. Will certainly go back and recommend to others.",

I landed at Sapporo Revolving because my usual spot doesn't open until 5pm. I'm pretty sucky about change so I didn't want to go to any new sushi spot but my cravings beat me! And thank god for that! Since this place has awesome reviews I thought what the heck do I have to lose. Service standards/greets/etc all get thumbs up. I am in love with the revolving line. I get to try new items, and enjoy the items I already love for only $2.50!!! Plus there are awesome dishes on the iPad freshly prepared upon ordering. Based on revolving items I picked from the line, I tapped at $17.50. I didn't quite like one of the dishes I picked up so guess what: I didn't finish it!!! And I got to try new awesome fish I'd probably never have tried before. So happy I ended up coming here! Can't wait to return and bring friends.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to having a rotating sushi restaurant in Las Vegas, I was used to going to many of them in Los Angeles... which gives me pretty high standards.   And I know they just opened but, my experience was terrible and I'm not going back.   They did give us a discount because were so many problems over all that night with lack of food on their conveyor belts and slow service. But that still doesn't make me want to go back.   Pros:  The staff was nice, large space, clean, and nice aesthetics.   Cons:  1. The conveyor belts had like nothing 85% of the time we were there. When there was stuff on the conveyor belt it was only sashimi and no rolls at all or any variety. (Tried to attach a video I took but it doesn't give me an opinion to post it, I see if I can post it at some point) and we were there around 8pm on a Saturday and there were a lot of people. Also some of the times that they did have items on the conveyor belt they didn't match the title card that was in front of them. (Towards the time we were leaving, like after an hour was when they started to have more items on the conveyor belt, but again all sashimi and nothing else)  2. A lot of the food had no taste  3. The pictures on the screens don't really match to the size that you get. For example I got an avocado roll and it was the size of my finger it was so tiny(looked much smaller than the picture see attached)   4. The iPads they use for the orders don't swivel to your direction so it's very annoying, it stays perpendicular to you at all times. And screen is so sensitive that if you tap on something by mistake, it puts the item in your order list, then when you go to your screen were you double check your order before ordering it, things will pop up that you didn't even know you pressed. You can delete them before you press order. But it's very annoying.   5. There are no descriptions of what is in any of the food. If you're ordering a roll for example you don't know what's in the roll unless it's like a basic California roll or something. If you order a specialty roll or more pricey food you have no idea what's in it.   6. The rotating belt delivery boat for when you order something off the screen didn't work on our row but It worked on the other two. All our food had to be delivered by servers. The servers kept asking us over and over which items we had received from our order, which got really annoying.   In my opinion, It's a very large conveyor belt sushi restaurant which shocked me that they weren't prepared for the amount of people that they had that night. It's the first one in Vegas.... you're gonna have a lot of people. Any place that I've ever been to has tons of food on the conveyor belts at all times and are much smaller places with people waiting outside for 2 hours.   When you go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant you want your food then and there, it goes very quick. You shouldn't have to wait because there's nothing on the conveyor belt, then you have to place the order without knowing what half of the food is and then wait for a server to bring it to you. (some food is self-explanatory by looking at it, but certain items are not) If that were the case I could've gone to a regular all you can eat sushi restaurant that lists all the food and ingredients and it's only brought by a server.  Take a look at Kula in Los Angeles for an example of how to run a restaurant like this. There restaurants are small and are super crowded and sometimes you have to wait outside for two hours. But they always have food on the conveyor belts from the second you sit down. And it's a variety of salads, rolls, sashimi, desserts, etc. They even have sashimi that isn't raw fish and alternatives if you don't eat fish or raw fish other than tamago. (Though the aren't perfect by any means, but there a great example of always being busy and being on top of their food and having their conveyor belts and boats work.)  Maybe doing research on other conveyor belt sushi restaurants would help to fix certain problems.",

We feel welcomed there and so far our family could get what they wanted at this location.  Good to see every plate comes out in such a consistency.

Please you can order certain items from the kitchen as well like ramen and udon.  Bon appetite!",

The dining room is lively and clean. They also have a  nice bar. The dining room features three conveyor belts rotating through, and each plate is a flat price of $2 50. Our favorites were Rainbow roll, Super white tuna, Shrimp taco, and Green tea cake. The sushi were pretty fresh. They count the plates left on our table. We had 16 plates!   In addition you can use the screens they have at each table to order a specific order and those prices varies. We ordered Shrimp tempura, and Soft pork Belly. When it's ready, an automated monorail robot deliver your food above the conveyor belt, that is so cute.  We were starving and only about 40 mins. Service was quick and friendly.  A good place to bring an out of towner for this experience!",

    "text": "Revolving sushi usually doesn't have a great reputation, but Sapporo Revolving Sushi does it well. Most other revolving sushi chains I've been to have been a hit or miss depending on the day and time you go (busier times = better usually). However, Sapporo has LOTS of seating but only opens certain sections during non-peak hours so items are fresher since they're not circling around as much!  Love the options here! I def recommend waiting for the roll options to come around on the conveyor belt instead of ordering off the touchpad system bc they come in smaller portions (4 pieces for $2.50 vs. whole roll for $7.50). My personal fav was the sapporo garlic tuna roll - can't go wrong w/this roll if you love tuna. Also, the toro here is SO good! Toro is more expensive than the regular tuna options ($2.50 for one nigiri), but it's absolutely worth it. They don't always have it, so don't hesitate on grabbing it when you see it! The ikura and unagi are also tasty, but I don't think they offer it on the conveyor belt.    I come here for the sushi, but their kitchen options (hot dishes) are also good. I've tried both the striped bass and the butter yaki shrimp, and although they are a bit pricey compared to the $2.50 sushi plates, the portions are pretty large!   Obviously you're not gonna get Sugarfish (and above) quality fish here, but for $2.50 a plate you can stuff yourself without having to worry about your wallet. Can't wait to come back on my next Vegas adventure!",

I totally get it but I was not that impressed with the food and especially the service it was sad to say the lease  I love salmon belly this place it did not make the cut the Ramon was ok.     There are so many other great sushi places is Vegas to go to..... I'm just saying the 40 min wait was not worth it at all.... sorry but I gata keep it real people..... the spicy tuna hand roll was the best thing there for me.....the fish is defiantly of lower quality and it came out the same place as your all you eat sushi   So I don't need all the hype I rather get good food and service.   It's not for me I was not impressed   So if your looking to take someone to sushi to impress them bells and Whistles this is your place.    But if want good sushi go some where else Sakana is great.   Good luck.....   That pic if a tuna taco that was also good",

It actually ended up being cheaper for my whole family to eat this way than AYCE .  The items ordered off the menu come to you on a robot tray, kind of like The Jetsons.

We got here at a great time before the dinner rush, and they were just opening one of the sides of tables so we knew everything coming out was going to be fresh.  Little by little, the tiny round plates of sushi started coming out and soon, there was an endless stream of nigiri and maki to our delight.  You can't beat the $2.50 a plate deal.  But wait, there's more.  We ordered a few items from the touch pad and like kids waiting for Christmas, we anxiously waited for the upper tray to shoot out from the kitchen and arrive with our dish.  Again, I am easily amused by technology.  Definitely a good selection and options on the menu for those that aren't into sushi, though why go there if you're not?    I wish I could visit here more often, but this place will definitely be one of my go to spots every time I go to Vegas.",

The sushi is covered and a sign let's u know what it is. You just grab what u want and stack your plates. I think it was $2.50 a plate and $1.75 during happy hour.   Good selection, fresh and good quality. 10 plates for 2 people and it was only $25.  That's a deal.    They have a small touchscreen where u can order drinks and other dishes from.  A small device delivers that to your table via the top of the conveyor belt.    Cool casual place with good sushi.",

She and I got there and the staff was so nice and attentive to us. Was a nice change, but I know since most of the place is all on the revolving track or robotic car that brings you stuff they do mostly drinks, refills and picking up lids because you keep your plates til the end.   The track of sushi has a good range of sushi being offered from appetizers like endamame to desserts like tiramisu. The range of rolls is good, very fresh and quite a diverse bunch. One of my favorites is the little sushi tacos, salmon is always a favorite of mine and to have it as a little taco was yummy. Each small plate is $2.50 ea. Prices vary on menu items from a tablet style on each table. I just stuck with the little plates got to try more that way. Instead of being stuck with a whole roll of the same kind it's 4 pieces which was nice and not to filling.   Stefany and I definitely finished off a good pile of plates but enjoyed everything we had. The staff, sushi and ambience definitely wanted me to go back.",

    "text": "Not going to lie, I was a little hesitant when my friend sent this place to me to try. How do they keep everything so fresh, on a conveyor belt? I read a little more into it and read the specifics: it's only on the belt 30 min before it's discarded and they really had to work with the health district on this one. So I say ok!  Pretty easy to find off Spring Mountain. Well kept, clean restaurant with 4 belts that rotate 2 sections. Great selection of sushi: albacore tuna, halibut, salmon, shrimp, crab. Along with a nice selection of rolls and soups. Everything was so incredibly fresh and delicious. Little white plates roll out, covered, and you just grab what you want. If you take the rolls off the belt, you get about 3-4, which is good if you want to try everything. You do have the option of ordering a plate which comes out to you on this cool rolling tray that talks to you to grab your food. So hip! Haha! Once you take your food, it rolls back into the kitchen.   The staff here are pretty awesome, too. They explain how everything works for the new comers.   This place was so good the first time, we came back the next night!",

    "text": "If you're looking for fancy rolls, this place is NOT for you. That said, the simplicity of the sushi here is definitely what I look for in nigiri - which is what I come here for. The conveyor belt items are all $2.50 ($1.50 during HH) with each plate having 2 pieces of nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is probably the most proportionate nigiri I've had. Most of the food items are served on a conveyor belt and while you can grab whatever comes out on the belt, you can also from the pad that's located on every table. You must be thinking that the sushi mustn't be fresh if it's constantly being left out on the conveyor belt however, that is not the case. The sushi that comes out is just as fresh compared to if you're ordering through the pad.  I can't stress enough how silky and melt-in-your-mouth the fish is!  This restaurant does offer a pretty extensive menu, which includes ramen. Their \"bowl\" of ramen is pretty much mini bowl but the flavors will not disappoint!",

I will not lie at first I was overwhelmed due to sensory overload there are conveyor belts right in front of your table, a touch screen menu and a little robotic cart that brings food out. Once I got the hang of it all I was totally immersed in the experience. Plates off of the conveyor belt are only two dollars which is super reasonable and you can either pick up 1 to 2 piece sushi or half rolls for that price. However if you'd like a full roll or anything from the kitchen you were able to order that as well. The selection was pretty large. This restaurant is kid friendly and both of my children both loved it. We Will definitely be heading back there.",

    "text": "FINALLY! Vegas has a legit revolving sushi place to fill my sushi loving needs! Not only do I get spoiled with the fresh AYCE options but now I get to be served without a wait. Coming from Hawaii and California, I am pretty spoiled when it comes to being served sushi with finesse. I've seen sushi on revolver belts, trains, and boats in water so being in Vegas where AYCE sushi is a BIG thing I was shocked there was no place like this until now. Me and my party arrived at 5pm and I suggest you all do the same as there was a wait soon as the restaurant opened and filled up all their seats. Our hostess gave my friend the rundown on how it works. Everything on the belt is $2.50! Yes TWO-FIFTY a plate! Such a deal for the options they give you. Please consult pictures for some of the mouthwatering options made available to to you. i would recap them for you but I fear I would start drooling. Now for those who want more than what's being on the belt, you can order off their computerized menu. Yes no waiting for your server to come around. You just choose what you want and send it on through. Sounds like heaven right? Wait, there's more! Most orders (not soups or desserts) will come out on their robotic food tram is what I called it. It plays music and stops right at your table all lighted up like a Christmas present!   The restaurant itself is very clean and put together so well. 3 rows of booth tables with each row having their own belt and robotic food tram. They do have a bar so you are more than welcomed to sit there but why bother going if you are't going for the experience? Oh yeah, the FOOD!  AND SERVICE! Ann took great care of us and even offered to set my dessert on the robotic food tram if I wanted. Deep down I did, but she had more important things to worry about. Sadly, the strawberry shortcake I wanted was unavailable but the manager compensated for any other dessert on the house. The owner and manager came by to make sure everything was ok which I always give a restaurant high marks for.",

Coming here, I didn't have a much of an expectation since a lot of revolving sushi restaurants I've tried in Cali are just fads. When we walked right in, the place is very roomy and has a bunch of tables, we came during dinner rush but only waited for about 5-10 minutes.   Everything on the menu is $2.50 a plate, unless you want full-sized rolls then they'd be about $7. They explained that they have a timer on each of their plates that come out of the conveyor belt and after 30 minutes of being on the belt, they automatically get rid of them. Salmon is my favorite sashimi and I must say, I was very impressed with the quality! Super fatty and fresh. I also really liked the lobster popcorn roll. If you ever want something that you're not seeing on the conveyor belt, you can always order on the ipad and it'll come to you hot and fresh!   I can't wait to come back and try more. I'm more than impressed with their quality as well as their excellent customer service. Give this place a try!",

It's $2.50 per plate while in CA revolving sushi it's $1 per plate. These plates DO add up, I only got 8 plates because that sums up to $20. -Me and my boyfriend left the restaurant feeling hungry because we REFUSED to spend more than $40. At other sushi places, you can get $25 AYCE sushi and walk out happy + full.",

They also have ramen available, but I did not try it. I went for the sushi off of the conveyor belt, which tasted great. Good for small or big appetites.",

Place had a very modern/trendy vibe to it from the music they were playing and the I-pads you order from if you want something other than what is coming out on the conveyor belt.  We were seated immediately around 7 the day after Christmas,  but it was 2 of us, I think for larger groups there could be a longer wait. If you are looking for an AYCE sushi place this is not it....but if you are looking for a quick sushi fix the fish was fresh and quickly served.   My husband really enjoyed the garlic tuna nigiri. I tried a roll that had shrimp tempura in it (dont remember which one) but stayed away from other rolls that had it because I thought the tempura tasted stale. Even though this is supposed to be a sushi restaurant we really enjoyed the garlic ramen, the broth was one of the best we've had in a while!",

That was fine until he crossed out my name, we had to come and ask him again and he said sorry. I was extremely disappointed and upset. I also expressed that negative attitude with our waiter, but I immediately felt sorry because Jeremy was pretty nice and he was not the person that caused the problem. About food, we expected more than that when we read the reviews on Yelp. Sushi on the belt are poor and not fresh tho, that's our personal thought. The only one we love is Kanto rolls with soft shell crabs and onion, good combination.  We also ordered Caterpillar, lobster and popcorn lobster rolls. They were all the same, too sweet, nothing special, not our taste. I ordered Gyu Katsu for my bf, omg the carrot sauce is very sweet and not related to the meat, it's weird. Miso ramen is normal.  Btw, if you go to ayce sushi restaurants, you pay less and get a huge number of appetizers, sushi rolls and nigiri than here. Good luck.",

Our table and others around the restaurant didn't seem to have soy sauce trays out with chopsticks, ginger and wasabi. $1.99 Beers were great and the quality of the food was good. We did order some times on the iPad but they never showed up. Later we found out they're sold out.

Then go somewhere else ... jk.  But really ... Buh bye, have a nice day. I joke, hahaha. Loosen up and enjoy.  Ok, so you're not feeling it for just sushi? No problem, a menu/touch pad is on the table. Your order will arrive on a tray that shoots out from the kitchen to your table. No kidding. You'll be like ... What the??? Is this my order? Now your happy - hopefully laughing - other patrons are looking in amazement at just what happened and wishing it was them. Yes, it is your order, take it off the tray and push the button and back to the kitchen the tray goes. Very tech savvy, riiight?  But dude, what about quality/taste of the items? Ok, think to yourself ...  items are rotating on a conveyor belt like your suit case at baggage claim. Are you sitting at a sushi bar and doing shots with Jiro? Again, just trying to be funny ... Ok, my apologies. Sapporo offers a sampling (at a fair price) from nigiri style to specialty rolls to items that are not sushi related. I enjoyed my experience here, I tasted the offerings of tacos (cute taco shell), edamame (the garlic one is awesome), salmon nigiri (salmon belly ruled), toro - one piece nigiri, very thin slice - and different specialty rolls. Yes, I would come back here but only to show the concept with family and friends who've never experienced it. Ambiance, parking and service were spot on! Btw, happy hour is offered but starts at 11p@50% off.",

The food came rather quickly which was a plus. The only thing I really liked and continued to order was the salmon belly. Most nigiri and rolls that I tried were not very fresh or overpacked with rice.   I probably wouldn't come back soon as there are plenty of other great sushi places in the valley. It's a try once for the experience only kinda place.",

    "text": "Came here for their late night menu, most of their basic nigiri is available at half price, so $1.25 a plate, with 2 pieces of nigiri on each. Their regular menu items are available but not discounted. I think they had drinks deals too. There was pretty good selection in terms of fish including salmon, tuna, amberjack, etc all the classics. Service was very fast and we mostly just took plates off ourselves. The conveyer belt is very long and can hold a lot of options, we took one of each nigiri we saw and two of a few favorites and spent about $20-$25.  Overall I would say this isn't the best quality sushi I've ever had but it was fine and I don't know how good stuff off their a la carte menu is. I think if i were paying full price for these nigiri it would be a bit much but the late night prices are a good deal. I would recommend coming during late night unless you want to order things off the menu in which case it won't matter when you come.",

Each sushi/nigiri at their revolving belt is $1.75!!  The quality of the sushi/nigiri is better the most of the ayce places around town. The ramen for $5 is also a favorite.

There are plenty of great restaurants in Vegas Chinatown and this one could be added to that list.  I like that there is little interaction with the staff. Any order you want that is not on the belt, you order through the iPad. A robot slides down and sends the food to you. Very simple to use. But staff was kind too. Considering this is revolving sushi, I don't understand how anyone could rate less than 5 stars. I highly recommend.",

I'm used to Kura Revolving Sushi Bar in San Diego, and Sapporo is very similar in quality, with almost no waiting time (I've waited almost 2 hours once for Kura).   My favorites are the little salmon tacos and the Toro. In total, we grabbed about 15 plates from the belt and ordered about $10 worth from the iPad, which is much cheaper than some AYCE sushi places. We loved the little train that the food is transported on when ordered. Gives a very futuristic vibe haha  This is a great place to satisfy sushi cravings without stuffing yourself. There are times when they won't have a certain fish available, but there's so much variety that'll still make it worth it.",

I found the fish to taste fresh and everything was nicely balanced with fish to rice ratios.   You can also order plenty of additional items like full-sized rolls, appetizers and main dishes.   Just remember that if you're really hungry this can get pricey. You're paying for the conveyer belt here and ayce sushi is still cheaper with a wider variety of options.

The price has gone up to $1.75 during happy hour and I do think quality has taken a bit of a hit as well. But I'm judging this by the value that you get. I don't think you will get this kind of value anywhere else with this type of quality. Even some of the budget sushi places in LA doesn't even come close to the quality here and you will be paying more. What I do wish is that some of the items that are not on the revolving sushi be ordered on the iPad. Depending on where you sit by the time the sushi gets to you it could be gone. Can certainly have it limited to a select few items and have a specific happy hour selection but we got a bit tired of seeing all of the same things over and over again. Would definitely come back again since it's great value.",

My brother and I shared a booth and also shared many of the items that came along the conveyor belt that runs throughout the restaurant. Each plate on the belt costs $2.50, and much like dim sum, they total up your plates at the end to see how much your owe. There's also a touchscreen where you can order items at various prices, and I highly recommend using it to get exactly what you want.  Although the revolving sushi came by frequently, we never saw any eel cruise by, so we ordered some from the touchscreen. That order came separately on a little car that ran on a track above the belt. Really cute, and you know it was fresh because it was made to order! The revolving sushi, on the other hand, was good, but you just don't know how many times it has moved along that belt before it gets to you  All told, we pulled 9 plates from the belt (salmon, hamachi, seaweed salad, and a few rolls) and ordered 3 more (eel) from the touchscreen. Adding in a large Sapporo beer, the bill was right around $40, so with a nice tip from my brother, we had a great meal for $50.  Sapporo is definitely worth a visit, if only for the novelty factor. But I'll be back for that $2.50 eel!",

Decided to kill time by stopping at the bar to take advantage of their 50% off Japanese Draft Beer. The bartender was helpful. He even gave me a taste of Asahi since I don't recall which one I liked better (Sapporo vs Asahi). Costing only $2 a glass, how can you say no to that Happy Hour deal?   Even before we were done with our beer, we were shown to our seats. The booth was huge and comfy. (You can fit six people easily.) The conveyor belt was easily accessible. Appreciated the fact that there was a cover over each dish. (Some guy at another table was sneezing like no tomorrow.)  The conveyor belt had a variety of choices. The slices of sashimi was generous, while the rice underneath was minimal. The sushi rolls are 4 pieces per dish for the most part. There were appetizers such as seaweed salad and edamame. (Note: Garlic Edamame is spicy. It isn't labeled that way so beware!) And don't worry! If by the time the conveyor belt comes around to you and you're only greeted with a plaque with the name of the dish and no dishes to follow, it will be quickly replenished the next time around. Oh, and I nearly forgot, each dish is only $1.50 during Happy Hour.   And whatever you can't find on the conveyor belt, you can order it from the screen located at your table. We wanted a miso soup to wash down all the deliciousness and was not disappointed when it was brought to us. (Sorry soup doesn't come flying out on top of the tracks of the conveyor belt!) However, Happy Hour prices doesn't apply to items ordered off of the screen.   Overall, it was a fun and filling late night meal!",

This is easily the best sushi I've had in Vegas and the ginger they serve you is very tasty.   Even their non fish food like the pork belly was very good.   I highly recommend this place. The price is right here too.",

Today's visit however has me just disgusted. We arrived, were not greeted by anyone. I signed in as \"Big Bird\" party of 3 (my husband said to pick a funny name). We were going to sit down and wait for a table however when I turned toward the front windows all I saw were BUGS crawling all over the seats and windows. My son had already sat down and had them smashed on the back of his shirt. We immediately informed a staff member who seemed to brush it off( the bug problem, not my sons shirt). We were then greeted by Nina who asked us if we had signed in, we said yes and told her about the pest problem. (So now two employees know, or so we thought) We were seated, ordered just water which took far to long to come. I ordered a miso soup and had to inform the waitress that I had done so and hadn't received it yet. Then my son says \"there's a bug in my food and he's alive! Sure enough still alive and straight from the kitchen! We informed the waitress and she took the plate away. Next thing we know a manager is walking by our table with fly traps! Obviously they already knew there was a problem if they already had the traps in their possession! I hate to say it because we LOVE the sushi here but please find the root of the problem and fix it (your bar probably) do not just band aid it with fly traps! No apologies given leads me to say our trip to Sapporo will be our last until they fix the bug problem and customer service problem!!",

My first impression of this place was very good, clean dinning area with a huge sushi conveyor system in the middle of the room. Overall, I have a great experience and the sushi were freshly made. On that day, we have about 30+ plate and our bill was decently price ($ 2.50 per plate). I definitely recommend this place for dinning off the Vegas strip and I would come back for a second seating if I ever visit Las Vegas again.",

What I enjoy even more is a place I can get that roll, and my kid and other half can choose completely different options and be just as happy. Another major plus, being able to eat as soon as I sit down. Just start grabbing as much as you can shovel in right off the conveyor in front of you.  My boyfriend doesn't eat sushi at all. His go to meal here is the black garlic ramen, the gyoza, the brussels, and the edamame. Me, I switch it up every time. With the sushi coming in 2-4 pieces a serving, you can try everything within a few visits.  The drink options are solid and great prices. Honestly, the prices here in general are great. If you're lucky enough to come at happy hour for the $1.50 plates, you can get insanely full for $20.  My only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the consistency is lacking a bit. I notice some days the ramen will be more garlic-ey than other days. Sometimes the conveyor belt has WAY more options. No huge complaints just things I've noticed.  I hear they're expanding and I look forward to trying the new location as well.",

(yes I'm talking about Genki hehe)  I don't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and was treated so well as I was here. The waiters/waitresses are so nice and very understanding. I went with a big group and we are definitely the type to ask for one thing after another, the waitress we had was so incredibly nice and was never once annoyed by any of our requests.  The food was on point. I love the train/robot thingy system (lol) that brings out some of your dishes. It gives the restaurant this futuristic vibe. It's also a very well-decorated/cute restaurant too if you couldn't tell from the pictures. Prices here are incredibly reasonable. Being from Seattle, I think we're a little used to paying more for food. I hope that if they do bring it here they can somewhat honor the prices ;) ! The food was such a huge hit at the table we couldn't keep anything on it for more than a few minutes. I honestly think we went through more than 30 plates of food... crazy, but absolutely delicious!  I need to fly back to Vegas just for one more dinner haha.",

We came in on a Wednesday at 7pm, it wasn't packed yet so we got a table right away. When you walk in a nice hostess showed us to our table, and the inside felt very clean and open. When we got to our table we were asked what we would like to drink, nothing was really explained to us but we already kinda knew what to do and how it all worked. The sushi on the belt is 2.50 for each plate. And of course you can order on the iPad and the little sushi train comes to you and you click the button to send it back. The waiters didn't come around a lot which I like, just to refill my drinks. Now for the AMAZING sushi!!! If I had a second stomach I would have kept eating! It taste so fresh and clean. The nigiri isn't drenched in sauce. It was the first time having a salmon taco and now I'm addicted!   Best to most okay sushi we had (there is no bad sushi):  -salmon tacos  -filet mignon nigiri (my boyfriends favorite) -New Zealand King salmon nigiri  -snow crab nigiri  -shrimp tempura with Ikura  -yellowtail tacos  -baby yellowtail nigiri -shrimp tacos  -White tuna  -toro nigiri  -yellowtail nigiri  -bluefin tuna  -Japanese mackerel nigiri  -smoked salmon nigiri -orange salmon   And we ended it all with a nice miso soup. I would highly recommend everyone try this place at least once! Our total was a little over $90, which for how much we ate and how fresh it all was it was worth it! I can't wait to go back and try some other nigiri and some rolls",

With that being said, I'll just list a few menu items I really liked and thought was a great value to get at the place. Deducting a star because the rice was dry and a little on the tough side.   1. Uni, really sweet and fresh. Unlike a lot of AYCE places with salty sea water tasting/fishy uni; 2. Premium Yellowtail nigiri: the fish was just so buttery! 3. Salmon belly: same reason as #2. 4. The yuzu dessert cake: two pieces of perfect bite sized cake to end a meal  We also ordered some large plates (tuna tartare, something of yellowtail, scallops, etc.) They were just okay. They have ramen as well. With $2.5/small plate, I can see it being a good place for a quick lunch and a quick stop to satisfy some sushi cravings.  I'd definitely want to go back and try more things.",

For a place that is pretty much automated don't think it's not a personal experience, they have plenty staff and you can see the cooks through plexiglass and see just how this place operates and see they're hustling their butts off.   Now I came here 2 times in one week, it's more than affordable and if you come during happy hour, plates are pretty much half off.   I can see this place becoming a chain.

They have one at each table. What's cool is that someone either brings out to your table or a machine slides down to your table.  The sushi was okay. Honestly, for $2.50 a plate, I didn't think it was worth the price. One can't help but wonder why it's that expensive for how it tastes. I'm sure the quality is great with fresh ingredients and good quality fish but it just didn't taste all too great for me. It was just okay. I would much rather go to an all you can eat sushi place and get the same amount of food for better taste.  The service was great. They were attentive and nice. They were friendly. They were also very quick but they weren't hawkish.   I'd probably come here with a group if someone wants to go here but it wouldn't be the place I recommend first.",

The toro sushi was fantastic! Black Garlic ramen was tasty as well. The cooked ebi dish from the kitchen was overly salted, but I wasn't devastated over it. Would come every week if the wait weren't 40+ minutes long! Hope the wait time dies down so I can get my fast sushi fix here on the regular.",

    "text": "Finally! Something similar to Hawaii's genki sushi! My family and I have been looking forward to coming here since it first opened and we finally did today! Pros - clean, neat, friendly staff. I love restaurants where the kitchen is visible so you know what goes on back there, and this is one of 'em. Everything on the conveyor belt is $2.50 and there are other varieties that you can order off the menu (iPad). Wanted to see what the hype was about with their black garlic ramen and the hype is real! Love it! Cons - with all the AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, coming here can be pricier (especially if you love sushi, like my family and I). Most of the nigiri plates on the belt mostly comes in twos. Their ama ebi & uni, which is always a must for me whenever I go to sushi restaurants, only came in one piece. Their fish to rice ratio is like many sushi spots. Our total came out to a little over $60 for three adults and a 5 y/o. Were we satisfied? Not really. Would I come here again? Maybe just for the black garlic ramen. I'd much rather go to an AYCE restaurant where I can get more for my buck.",

The sushi quality is about average and orders from the iPad menu take a bit too long to come out,and it was a bit too long for us to get seated in the first place. The revolving sushi was decent, down side is some have been sitting out longer than others, you can tell by rice freshness, up side is assortment is great. Those little plates add up quickly beware! The service definitely leaves something to be desired, it is a struggle to get anything from the waiters like sauce and drinks, etc. Ambiance is amazing, idea is fantastic. No wifi, which is a bit of a shock given the hi tech nature of their delivery system.  All around, definitely check it out, and if they boost up the food and service quality it will be a go to spot for sure!",

Plus, with all you can eat establishments everywhere in the area where Sapporo is located, this place is definitely a go-to when we don't feel like eating too much. They have plenty of selections when it comes to appetizers and (of course) sushi but they also have ramen too! I highly recommend their Black Garlic Ramen if you're in the mood for ramen.   The only issue I have with this establishment is customer service. Although most of the job is already being done by the revolving machine (to bring your food, since you can just grab most of the things that you want), it still takes a long time to get our drinks refilled or to find a server that would help us. I understand that there's a lot going on behind the scenes, but if you don't watch your customers attentively then you will surely deter them from possibly coming to your establishment again.  Negative experiences aside, if you would like to try this place, please do so! We don't have revolving sushi in Vegas, so this is definitely something that you should try.",

I came at lunch time on a Monday so it wasn't entirely busy and I admired how attentive the servers were. They explained to us the process of ordering conveyor belt style and there was an iPad available at each table for you to order from. I ordered the shrimp tornado which was extremely flavorful as well as the garlic edamame. I realized that ordering from the iPad would give you the full size order of the rolls while grabbing items off the conveyor belt had smaller portions for $2.50, which was pretty nice. I took a popcorn lobster off the conveyor belt because I wanted to try it, but my review is 4 stars because of that. I loved the flavors they were trying to present but the lobster itself wasn't doing it for me. It seemed almost all batter in comparison to lobster meat. Nonetheless I do enjoy this place and I look forward to coming back because their quality seems fresh and I want to their speciality kitchen menu items. Overall, with the full shrimp tornado roll, garlic edamame, and mini popcorn lobster roll off the conveyor belt the price came out to be $15 which isn't too expensive at all! If I could give 4.5 stars instead of 4 I would.",

I'm spoiled with revolving sushi in California where the selection is huge and they even have where you deposit your empty plates and it records and adds to your tab how many you've eaten instead of stacking up plates on the table. If Sapporo had both of those things, This restaurant would be solid. As far as service goes, the servers could probably pay a little more attention. I feel as if they think they don't have to check up on their tables as much because it's self serve for the most part but not really think about drink refills and special orders from the kitchen.",

We were able to get a table in reasonable time. It was a nice experience. We mainly resorted to picking out from the conveyor belt...ordered a few appetizers from the iPad on the table, as well as a few drinks from the bar. The restaurant itself was crazy busy. One thing I do have to point out was the staff was very friendly. Also, one thing I like is seeing everything clean and everyone diligently working. The staff matched the pace of the restaurant traffic. Another thing I liked was the management was also very nice and was also helping the wait staff with tables and bussing. I have already recommended this place to a few friends. I enjoyed the food very much I could barely breathe! We took about 17 different plates. My favorites were: peppered tuna, lobster roll, their gyozas (cooked to my level of satisfaction). I didn't really like the drink I ordered the peach melon margarita because it was strong (but I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol) so I'm sure others will enjoy! Based on the service, cleanliness, and price I would have to say I would be coming here again soon and with others so they can try it too!",

    "text": "Conveyor belt sushi finally hit Las Vegas! I've been itching to experience revolving sushi and I'm so thankful it finally arrived in the Valley!  The concept is pretty simple. There is a conveyor belt full of different kinds of sushi (with labels right before the plates) where you can pick up the food you desire. From what I've seen, most of the plates come with 1-4 pieces. Do also note that desserts are not available to pick up on the conveyor belts. I learned that the conveyor belt actually has sensors on it that will alert the staff if the sushi has been there for more than 30 minutes so it can be replaced with fresh sushi, which settles my original apprehension of the safety of the food revolving around the restaurant for hours. At the end of your meal, the servers count how many plates you have on your table and add it to your bill since it is not automatically counted. Since I had come a little later in the evening (around midnight on a Thursday), there wasn't much going around the conveyor belt. Because of this, we had to get our food through the ordering system on the tablet.  Each table gets a tablet with the menu to choose from. These items include nigiri sushi, specialty rolls, tempura, ramen, appetizers, and dessert. The menu is not extensive, but it surely is enough. Prices are pretty reasonable. It is $2.50 for two pieces of nigiri (1 piece for some choices such as toro, ama-ebi, and bluefin tuna), a little under $10 for speciality rolls, etc.  After selecting the items you want to order, you place your order and wait for the chefs to make your dishes. It took about 10 minutes for the chefs to complete each of my orders. You receive your order from the kitchen via an electronic track on top of the conveyor belt. A machine travels to your table, lights up and plays a prerecorded message signaling you to pick up your food, and returns back to the kitchen.  Sushi quality was pretty good and tasted fresh. It is comparable to most of AYCE sushi spots across town. I was also able to try the salmon tacos and enjoyed them. The crunchy wonton shells were a great contrast compared to the fish.  Service was very limited. I did not interact with any staff aside from getting seated, introducing us to the ordering system, the occasional drink refill/plate clean-up, and receiving the bill when prompted on the ordering system. However, the interactions I had were all positive.  Overall, the price is competitive to the AYCE sushi prices around town for a higher quality without the inherent pressure to stuff my face with food to get my money's worth. I would warn you to be cautious if you are a big eater, though. Prices can add up fast if you don't pay attention! For anyone who hasn't experienced conveyor belt sushi, I would recommend trying this place out! Being the only one of its kind in Las Vegas, this place will catch a lot of attention soon!",

We came during their late night happy hour that had several liquor specials as well as half off the sushi on the revolving belt.  We first started by the bar to grab some beer as we waited for our table to be set. The bartender was great and was nice enough to have us sample the beers offered before ordering. Once we were seated, the staff informed us how it worked. Mainly you grab the plates of sushi off the belt and keep the plates at the end for them to calculate the total. You can also order other dishes on the tablet, but they are not counted in the happy hour special. The special order items either are served by your server or comes out to your table on the robotic tray above the belt of moving sushi. The sushi selection on the belt was a mixture of special rolls and nigiri. The sushi was very fresh tasting. I thought that their special rolls were interesting in combination of flavors. What's also cool is you can see a slight view of the chefs making the food in the back.  Service was overall very good as the staff very very friendly and helpful.",

The service here was fine. You honestly don't really see the waitstaff very often; drinks and taking certain dishes away or questions.  The overall experience is fun with the conveyor belts and ordering your items on the touchscreen. Our 6 year old thought it was so cool. Great opportunity for some fun photo/videos for your social media.   The actual sushi was the disappointment. Everything we had was just okay. My husband and I usually do AYCE sushi because we love sushi and have huge appetites. Our appetites are too big for a place like this and the quality of the sushi just wasn't there. We were still hungry and could have ate more but we honestly just didn't want anymore of what they had.   They need to fix their soda machine. Our sodas were super flat. I've read other reviews and it seems to be a consistent problem.   One more thing that I think the restaurant needs to work on is the menu. Any other sushi spot would tell you on the menu exactly what's in the sushi; inside has these ingredients, outside has these ingredients and we use this sauce. I have food allergies, so it's annoying not being able to see what's in my sushi and having to call a waiter over to ask.",

I've been to other places with the revolving belt sushi option and the concern was always that the sushi was not fresh.  That's definitely not the case with this place.  There are 3 total belts and several sushi chefs making sushi fresh every second.  Plus there is an iPad on your table that lets you order in an instant!  You want an appetizer just select it on the iPad and it gets sent back to the kitchen immediately.  The best part is a robot brings it out to you within minutes.  Yes a robot! It comes down the track above the sushi belt and stops at your table, the lights blink and a voice instructs you to take your dish.  When you grab it, the robot goes straight back to the kitchen where it came from.  Your kids will love it, your friends will love it,  you will love it.  The sushi is high grade and the service is stunning.  A must visit destination for sure.",

    "text": "Finally! Revolving sushi in Las Vegas. I'm super happy it is finally here.  I know it seemed like a fading fad from the 90s but I assure you, where I am originally from, it never went out of style. Where I moved from, revolving sushi made a come back around 2013. But for some reason, it never made it to Vegas until now. And I understand why, when there's AYCE sushi almost everyone where in Vegas.  The layout for Sapporo is different from what I am accustomed to.  As my husband and I figured out a few minutes after being seated, there are three sections in the restaurant. Therefore, there are 3 conveyor belts.  They serve the same things, just on three different belts. So if your belt is running low on dishes, well, the other one is full. However, you can't just get up and reach over someone's table to get that one dish because that's just plain rude.  In the normal revolving sushi restaurant, the kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant and the belt goes all the way around the restaurant. In this way, the belt is always full.  Sapporo does have a nice system on each table where you can submit regular orders of sushi, order dessert, miso soup, three different ramen options, udon, and other items that are on the belt. In fact, the family that sat across from us had two little boys. The boys favorite dishes were the taco shrimp and taco yellow tail. The taco shell is made of deep fried won ton wraps. Because people were snatching up the tacos faster than it could get to us, the family submitted three separate orders of the tacos using the tablet. The tacos were electronically zipped over to the family right above the belt. It was so cool!  The items from the belt had your usual items like tuna, yellow tail, crunch, shrimp, tamago (egg), crab leg, philly rolls.  They also had something called sexy girl.  Depending on the roll, there is either 1 to 4 rolls to a plate. For example, the tamago had 2 items, the crab leg had only 1, the mexican roll had 3 items, while the philly and lobster crunch had four rolls. Each plate is reasonably priced $2.50/each. And I have to say, it was pretty good. My favorites, the tamago, lobster crunch and yellow tail taco. Damn! I just realized, they didn't have any gyoza! I always get gyoza! :(  My husband ordered the miso soup and the broth was really good.  My husband also ordered a bowl of tonkatsu ramen, which is a small bowl at $4.25. I thought the broth for the ramen was ok, but I would order it again. I do think the size and the price is really good.  The one thing it didn't have, desserts on the belt. :( You have to order from the tablet menu. And the desserts are slim pickings. There's no mochi ice cream, but there is tiramisu (which is Italian) and ice cream (pineapple sorbet, vanilla, pistachio and green tea). Tiramisu is $6.95 (yipes) and ice cream is $2.95/each.  And although garlic spicy edamame was on the belt, that was $3.50. The typical revolving sushi has different plate colors that determine the price of the dish. Sapporo has one dish color with a set price of $2.50/each. However, the edamame is in a bowl. I'm assuming that anything in a bowl on the belt is $3.50?? In any case, during this visit, the only thing on the belt in a bowl was the garlic edamame.  Get here early or get here really late as they close at 2 am. My husband and I got here around 5:30 when they opened up the last section. However, when we left at 6:45, there was a lot of people waiting.  The service was good. The restaurant is nice and clean with contemporary decor.   I definitely like the price. My average number of plates at revolving sushi is 5. For me, the price is right. However, if you have a husband like mines where he wants to try everything, then a dinner/lunch date is actually comparable to AYCE sushi.",

The best part is the robot tray server that brings your order above the tray lines. It was a good different.  I really enjoy the way we can easily pick our sushi off of the conveyor belt and the ease of ordering from the tablet menus. The servers are quick, courteous, friendly and fast with our order. The dish on the conveyor belt are all $2.50 a piece. You can also order a full roll, appetizers, ramens, and desserts. All reasonable priced.   We ordered everything to try, everything was delicious! Our favorite were the shrimp tacos, popcorn lobster roll, salmon skin hand roll, Sapporo salmon roll, crunchy roll, pork belly, and the various ramens.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to try smaller serving of different sushi verses going to an all-you-can-sushi place where you have to eat it all or pay for it. This place gives you 3-4 pieces of sushi roll on the plate for $2.50 and of course they had nigiri. We try a lot of different sushi. We've already plan to go back again, it was that good, great experience!",

I just wanted to let him know, and I assumed he'd be a bit more understanding and give some empathy. He didn't care. Nothing about him cared for my wife's & my sanitation. This is UNACCEPTABLE!

For anyone who hasn't gone to a rotating sushi bar, you don't realize how much fun it is until you come here.  You sit down and while you can order from a menu, sushi rotates around and you just pull plates off and eat what you want.  We have been here many times since our first visit and like something different each time.  Off the menu we love the yellowtail and shrimp tacos.  Off of the belt we enjoy the garlic tuna or cajun albacore.  We have had some fishy fish here which include the toro and scallop but you can't have it all at this place.  The cuts on the fish are a little smaller than you'd hope but then again for the price you can't beat it.  The place is very clean, service is very good and the sushi has high turnover which makes it the best to go to.  We've been to others but nothing compares to this place.  For sure 5 stars for the best rotating sushi but don't come here expecting the best sushi of your life.  This is the best for what it is and they do a  darn good job at it.",

The shrimp were very decent sized. The udon we ordered was alright, I've had really good and really bad udon and this sits comfortably in the middle, the noodles were perfectly cooked but the broth isn't what I'm accustomed to but still tasty.

    "text": "I love conveyor belt sushi places. Who doesn't love a good raw fish merry-go-round? Unfortunately there's usually a bit of a trade off. Sure, it's fast, and even fun, but if we are being honest, sushi is meant to be eaten immediately upon preparation, not after it's travelled past your table 37 times.  That being said, Sopporo might have figured out how to do this right. All of the selections on the conveyor belt are well made and taste fresh. This isn't high end by any means, but it's pretty respectable, and every bit as good as you might get at many other comparably priced sushi places. Plus, by having the options of small plates you get to try more. Win-win people.  The most fun part is ordering freshly prepared items from the iPad style menu positioned at your table. Want something not on the belt?Order it  up. Once ready, a little robot tray glides past the other booths to you and personally delivers your order. It even speaks to you and tells you to pick it up. If I was 12 years old, I would think this was the greatest thing I had ever seen. Since I have the mentality of a 12 year old, I still think it's pretty great.  Look, this place is fun, fresh, clean, modern, unique and has excellent service. You can control how much you spend, as well as eat the perfect amount for your appetite at the time. If I lived in Las Vegas, I would stop by all the time.",

This place from outside looks typical sushi joint, the revolving sushi part is a smart design with booths that can fit 4-6, there are also single chairs on the other side. Dishes are $2.50 each it is very affordable but can also add up fast if you get too happy with ordering too much food. Some of the dishes were good like garlic tuna, red snapper, kampachi and kid's favorite cheesy tonkatsu.  Saba was a bit too strong of  vinegar taste, portions are petite size for some items like scallops. We did order items off the tablet menu, uni and ikura was A-ok hang rolls are pretty good size, the kitchen did forget our tuna tartare order, service was decent, good 3.5 stars with minor improvements can easily get up to a solid 4!",

We came here later at night for happy hour and were able to get a seat for 5 right away. The restaurant is clean and You pay based on the amount of dishes that you grab. You can even custom order dishes. They come out on a robot. They have all kinds of selections to choose from than just basic nigiri. The servers are super attentive and always checked on us and made sure to fill up our waters. I would recommend their flavored calpico type yogurt drinks. The downside of this place is if you sit on the wrong end of the belt, the dishes that everyone wants would get taken first.",

Thier hot green tea was excellent, the best tea I've had in a japanese place in quite a while. The black garlic ramen was well balanced and not too overwhelming with the oil. Sushi was good- both the nigiri and the rolls. My personal favourite was the new zealand king salmon, it was so creamy I am still thinking about it now at home.  Ice cream was delicious too. Vanilla was ok but the green tea was out of this park, I had to share. Would definitely come back esp for that happy hour deal.",

My boyfriend and I usually come here after work to enjoy some good, inexpensive sushi without any disappointment. Tonight the food was good as it always is, but the reason I will not be back is because of the service. We ordered some food off the menu and waited almost 30 minutes for it. When we asked if we could cancel it off the bill so we could leave, the food suddenly came out and the waitress told us that we could not take it off the bill. The only thing they were able to take off the bill was the miso soup that never came. Also they barely checked up on us tonight and we never got our waters refilled.

    "text": "This might be our new favorite sushi spot! When we moved here from Hawaii 16 years ago we wondered why there were no rotary (or revolving) sushi places here - and now....there's one!! We were pretty excited to try it out. We went on a Monday afternoon & considering the reviews I read, I was surprised to see that it wasn't crowded (but maybe because it was a Monday). Anyhow, on to the review. The place was not too big and not too small.  We were greeted and seated as soon as we entered.  The host explained how everything worked - basically all the revolving plates were $2.50 and if you wanted something else from the menu then you ordered it via the iPad on your table. Then a little robotic thing comes out, stops at your table, beeps and tells you to remove your order and then you're done.  The variety for the $2.50 plates wasn't bad at all. The salmon and toro were good and I really liked that they didn't put so much rice with their sushi.  We also special ordered 4 pieces of uni ($2.50 per piece) and seared scallops with mango salsa ($7.95). Okay, so this is really the only thing we didn't care for. I know uni comes in different grades but this had to be the lowest grade. But I guess you get what you pay for.  And then the scallops....they looked beautiful on the plate but when we bit into it it was still very cold in the middle. The only thing worse would've been if the scallops were over cooked.  We just decided we wouldn't order those things again.  Overall, food was good, service was good and price was fair. Our bill came to $64 (including drinks).  I love that you don't have to wait for your food like you do with AYCE!",

    "text": "Nice place, very modern looking. The fish was good, better then most AYCE places. Definitely would recommend it to anyone especially if you've never experienced a conveyor style sushi restaurant. The prices are good at 2.50 for anything on the conveyor belt plus some various items at different price points you can order on a tablet. Your total dinner cost can add up quick though if you eat alot of the premium fish which only comes with 1 piece of nigiri per order.   We had a great time, but I knock off a star mainly because water, wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce plates should come either right before you are seated or right after. The great thing about conveyor style sushi restaurants like buffets is you can eat almost instantaneously. It took at least 5 minutes to get water and another 5+ after that for the wasabi, ginger and soy sauce plates. I also hope the tablet problem gets fixed, most of us were finished but my gf wanted green tea ice cream and the tablet just wasn't working. The same thing happened to the table across from us. The placement of the tablet and the secured stand make it very awkward to fix while someone is having dinner, luckily we just ordered the ice cream from the waitress. I trust they will fix these easily correctable issues in the future.",

Everything on the revolving belt was 2.50 and also had items on their electronic ordering menu.  As a whole my husband and I enjoyed everything we ate and would come back again!",

They have sushi revolving (its timed so you know its fresh) on a conveyor belt, but you can also order off of a screen on your table (or from your Server) and have other items that come out to you directly from a robot on a track above the conveyor. I'd never seen anything like it and we enjoyed the novelty. The sushi was not the best we'd ever had but certainly good. We appreciated the efficiency and the fact that you could not over order. We will be back next time we are in Vegas.",

If you dont come during happy hour its only $2.50 a plate which still ends up being cheaper than AYCE at other places and you don't end up forcing yourself to eat something you don't like in order to not get charged extra. My favorite is the popcorn lobster roll and the Sapporo special roll. My fiance absolutely loves the Tonkotsu Ramen. I had never been to a belt sushi before but had always wanted to try one. It's always busy when I come but the wait is not too bad and they have a bar you can sit at and order drinks while you wait. The bartender is always friendly and even told us that the company that owns this place owns other restaurants too and now I must go try them!",

I have mixed feelings about this place though but didn't want to give a low star rating because I understand they are new. I am just here to put in my two cents:  I think with AYCE places everywhere in Vegas, this place has a lot to compete with. The quality of sushi at AYCE places I frequent was actually better than the quality here. I am not saying the quality of the fish was terrible, just not as good. For $2.50 a plate, it sure adds up fast, and I was still hungry by the time I had spent what I could have spent at an AYCE place. On a side note, for $2.50 a piece, the toro was amazing!!   I was very impressed with how fast the iPad orders came out. I was not impressed that there was a bug crawling on my plate of toro when it came out though.   I would probably come back if I am just craving a few pieces of nigiri or toro...or if they  up the quality of the fish. If they added fresh scallop or conch to the menu, that would be even better. But perhaps this place is not for me.",

It's located in China Town in a little strip mall with ample parking. The restaurant itself is very modern looking, and appears to be clean and well kept.  What my family and I love about this place is the fact that you can come here with any sized appetite. If you wanna stuff your face, it's perfect! If you aren't that hungry and just wanna snack on a couple of things, also perfect! Since they charge by the plate, you can eat as much or as little as you want and you have a variety of dishes to choose from. Plus the prices are extremely reasonable, and the service is great.   A+ in my book!",

Both things came in under 10 minutes. The waiter was also very attentive and refreshed our drinks promptly.   Each plate is $2.50 and I think that for that price the portions are pretty good.

However, quality of the sushi is similar and I even dare to say worst than some AYCE places, such as Goyemon.  The roll tasted funky and old.  They also messed up on the billing.

The sushi is definitely worth it for the price you pay, although they repeat a lot of the same options.  I'm sure if you ask for more they will be more than happy to make it.  I asked if the edamame is part of it and they made some and served it on the conveyor belt.  So that a plus for service in my books.",

    "text": "First and foremost, thank you for always providing excellent service Ann Marie and Elina. You have made each visit a pleasurable one and we hope to see you upon our many returns.   The Sapporo Revolving Sushi experience is just so much fun. All the plates are on display like little food gems just waiting to be picked up by you. When you order from the iPad a little trolley robot chan comes to deliver your food. So cool, I need one now.   The quality of fish is great and the base price of $2.50 for everything on the rotary is more than reasonable. Most people I know find themselves full by the time they have eaten the equivalent of the price of an AYCE sushi dinner. You can find most of the popular Nigiri selections, half orders of special and classic rolls, side dishes, and desserts on rotation. Other selections and full rolls can be found on the iPad menu and will be delivered by the little trolley robot chan. Please remember to let her know that you are satisfied with her service by pressing the little button to return her to her home.   Dinners and lunch can get busy. I think it is worth the wait if you can afford the time. There is comfortable seating in the waiting area and a bar. The restaurant has always been clean each time I have visited and the food and service is always excellent. I'll be back to visit soon, like later today.",

It was good, quality sushi, but boy you could sit there for hours and only see 1 or 2 new items show up on the conveyor belt. This is definitely a place to go if you're not starving and if you want to try new things!   The conveyor belt mostly just brought out plates with 2 pieces of nigiri, $2.50 a plate. My partner and I had 20 plates and costed us $27 a person, w/o tip. I could've ate all you could eat sushi with rolls and appetizers for that price. I probably won't return but I'm glad I experienced it!",

    "text": "If you're the type of person who doesn't want to waste food from a traditional \"All You Can Eat (AYCE)\" restaurant, then Sapporo's conveyor belt sushi is the place for you.  Concept: The idea of a conveyor belt sushi originated only in the last century so it is a fairly new face to the diverse city of Vegas. They offer ramen, full-size sushi rolls, appetizers, and desserts when ordered from a tablet and unlike the the set price from the belt, these prices vary.   Pricing: For the quality you get, $2.50 per plate from the conveyor belt is fair! The food (especially fish) is fresh, the dishes are small yet not overwhelmingly undersized, and if you are active duty or a veteran they offer military discount.   They have happy hour everyday (say whaaat)! Plate prices on the conveyor belt are reduced to $1.50 per plate. Japanese draft beer is 50% off and large hot sake is also 50% off.  Happy Hour Operations: I have been to happy hour a couple of times and it does get pretty jam packed. Friendly reminder: military discount can not be activated during HH operations. Sunday-Thursday | 10pm - 12 am Friday & Saturday | 11pm - 2 am  Attentive customer service, cleanliness, and quality of food is the reason I keep coming back for more. Good news is that they are expanding to the Centennial (South Durango & 215) area and Town Square!",

    "text": "One of the hardest decisions I've had to make in life is to decide whether I want to be Korean or Japanese.  I mean, Koreans have BTS, Kimchi, K-kop, mandatory 2 year military service, and a dear and glorious leader, but then Japanese people have weird-ass gameshows, Sushi, anime, and a deep-seated hatred for, not only Westerners, but all non-Japanese due to an old isolationist belief.  But I digress.  We're here to talk about sushi, and this place does sushi.    Revolving sushi on conveyor belts are nothing new.  Heck, they've been around long before Godzilla ever killed Mothra in Tokyo (but somehow they always rebuild).  They've just never made it to USA until recently.  The layout here is odd though.  People don't sit around 1 conveyor belt, but rather there are 3 small ones that split up the restaurant.    THE LAYOUT - Simple, easy.  Food comes around on 3 conveyor belts, and you pick what you want and just put it on your plate.  Each plate is $2.50, regardless of what's in it.  You can also order everything on the menu and more, including ramen, salads, ect. on the tablet at each table.  If it's a soup, the waiter brings it to you.  If not, the food comes out on a motorized cart attached to the belt to your table.  It beeps, you take off your food, press a button and it returns to the kitchen.  SO. COOL. After you're done, request a bill on the tablet and the waiter will total your plates with what you ordered from the tablet (if anything)  THE FOOD - They have a great variety of fish.  Some fish you've never seen.  They also have sea urchin @ $2.50 a pop, which is amazing.  The sushi is SO GOOD.  It's rather small though, but they are only charging $2.50 for 2 pieces so idc.  I thought the ramen would be wack, but it's amazing good for a place that doesn't specialize in it.  Even the pork slice that comes with it is slightly burnt and amazingly fatty.    Be careful though, these can add up,  Before you know it, you'd be shelling out big bucks because it's so good.  CHEERS!",

    "text": "Ever since I went to a conveyor belt sushi spot in LA, I've been wondering when we'd get one here. Sapporo opened about 3 months ago, and I come here fairly regularly. They use a microchipped plate system to stay within health code regulations and ensure that product is not sitting out for very long, so everything is fresh.  I initially came in for their grand opening and was able to try several of their dishes and have since come back for birthdays, with visitors from out of town, and just as a general spot to catch up with friends at a new and interesting place. Management knows they are competing with AYCE pricing and having the variety of belt and higher-quality kitchen dishes makes them stand out. You'll probably spend about the same amount as AYCE, or a bit more.  The conveyor belt has apps, 3-piece rolls, nigiri, and the occasional dessert, with all plates priced at $2.50. The fish has been consistently fresh on my visits, and the belt allows you to grab a bite as soon as you sit down without waiting on service. I especially like their kitchen items, which are electronically delivered as well- they've consistently added to the menu over time, offering dishes that are similar to other spots in town (Yonaka's Sake Orengi, Pier 215's soft shell crab, etc.) but at a lower price point. I'll be trying their new Truffle Octopus dish next time.  Favorite items include the garlic tuna, orange salmon, scallops and branzino (cooked), the hand rolls, and the Valley of Fire roll (full size only). The guests I've taken have been especially excited about the sushi tacos, pork belly, and mini-ramen bowls (black garlic especially), but the novelty of the technology doesn't get old.   Service has always been attentive and helpful. Though staff is not actively coming by to take orders (you use the iPad), drink refills are consistently timely and everyone has been polite. Occasionally, orders will be delayed due to tech issues, but it's only happened once across several visits.  TIP: Check their social media for the occasional contest. This brand is opening a KBBQ conveyor belt business soon, too!",

Be aware when being seated the section on the right has a very limited selection of sushi revolving on the belt.   The food is still fresh and ok but if you're not seated in the main section there are much better places out there for the same price for what you get.   They recently raised their happy hour prices as well.   That wouldn't make much of a difference but when you see the same 5-7 options instead of 15-20 like on the main section,  it's just not great.     If you're going to Sapporo make sure you're seated in the main section not the one to the right.   If you want a unique experience with great staff this is still a great place to go but once you've tried it, feel free to explore the other options around town.   I will definitely be exploring other places.   Maybe some day down the line I'll be back but right now I doubt it.",

A short wait when we arrived but that just gave the wife and I time to start eyeing what we wanted to eat as items were being delivered to tables before our eyes.   We were seated and immediately got to see a wide variety of small plates displayed on the revolving belt. We chose a couple drinks and looked over the menu / iPad which is on each table. We ordered the Ginza Mule and Hana Sake which were both delicious 5/5. Plenty of great items to choose from, made fresh and placed on the belt for quick turn around or place an order on the iPad on each table and the item will either be sent via a robot who blinks and plays music at you or by the less conventional human being ;-). The server told us the items stay on the belt a maximum of 30 minutes.   We began grabbing plates off the belt including: sea bass, salmon, tuna, shrimp tacos, squid, white tuna, New Zealand salmon which is delicious, a couple rolls, seaweed salad, halibut. And before we knew it had devoured 18 plates worth of sushi! From the iPad we chose the hamachi carpaccio which was superb 5/5!  For dessert we shared a bowl of pistachio ice cream 5/5.   Overall this place was amazing! Can't wait to come back and update this review.  ***update a week later: We came back with the family this time and enjoyed more great sushi, some ramen noodles and popcorn lobster. For dessert I highly recommend the strawberry shortcake 5/5. The table for 6 was about a 15-20 minute wait but well worth it. The entire family enjoyed a great meal for lunch. We devoured 22 plates and about 8 items from the menu. Arigato Sapporo Revolving Sushi  Till we meet again my new found friend...",

Actually got a chance to try this super popular and trendy Japanese restaurant that is hard to missed with the crowds of foodies, baby boomers, conventioneers, tourists and everyone else drawn to see multiple conveyor belts filled with sushi. Including Nigiri, Gyoza, Seaweed Salad, 4 piece sushi rolls including some desserts like Match and Chocolates cake pieces. You can see and hear the aha, wow and umm from everyone!   This place gets really busy and plan ahead, especially the durning evening hours and weekend. However, we were seated within the 15min that was allotted to our party of 3. Upon being seated, our friendly server was helpful and attentive to the point our table was clean and water cups was consistently filled. Kathryn, our server explained the concept and made sure we were ok. We ordered a good amount of items through the touch screen tablet attached to the table. We personally like the concept especially if your feeling hungry.   A few delicious items that was impressive was the Salmon, Blue Fin Tuna, Super White Tuna and Toro. Every plate is micro-chipped that allows the kitchen to keep track how long each dish has been on the conveyor belt that assures you that everything is fresh. We also got a Sapporo Special roll, this was made just right with a consistent texture and balanced ingredients. We did notice that the Sushi Rolls we got wasn't over stuff with too much rice like other Sushi places. Ramen and Udon soup bowls were good in size and make a great meal combined with Sushi. For desserts, I really enjoyed their Strawberry Cake. Moist and balanced flavor with a good amount of strawberry flavoring. Even, Ms. Strawberry Shortcake herself would be proud of this dessert, lol.   I would come back and play pick and choose my favorite or if I need a quick bite to eat this would be on top of my list.   2018 Yelp Review #22",

    "text": "Sapporo is surprisingly good. For about the same price as AYCE, you get better quality fish and ridiculously fast and friendly service. They are a well-oiled machine, and the low turnaround time was a welcome relief on a busy Sunday night.  When I go for sushi, I start off with miso soup and lots of nigiri. And I felt like Sapporo did a good job on them both. The miso soup was flavorful and the fish quality was fresh in terms of off-strip prices. We roughly ended up spending $25 a person for rolls, tempura, and lots of nigiri including more premium pieces (toro, ebi, and uni) to share.  Definitely recommend this place if you're super hungry, in the area, and craving sushi.",

    "text": "I yelped \"revolving sushi\" during our stay in Las Vegas and this place had the most stars and reviews so I thought I'd give it a try.  My family and I enjoyed it a lot.  The sushi was fresh and the ambiance was nice. I am a sucker for yellowtail, uni and red wine, and this place had it all. The wine was relatively inexpensive. I paid $5 for a glass of cabernet sauvignon. I also loved that you can order on an ipad aside from the conveyor belt and a little drone brings your special order to your table.   Our server, Elias and the rest of the staff were really nice and attentive. Everything on the conveyor belt is $2.50 a plate, not bad. They have a good variety. My husband ordered the tonkotsu ramen and he liked it. My kids had the miso soup with a side of rice and devoured it.  I ordered several plates of yellowtail, white yellowtail, bluefin tuna, and uni yummy!   Surprisingly, we spent $50 and left with happy tummies. This place was overall delicious!",

You sit next to the conveyor belt which makes you felt like a kid and your are waiting for your mom's permission to grab a plate. Everything is well labeled and well stocked. I never had to ask for an item to be restock. What? Want something other than the 30 or so amazing choices right next to you? That's just a touch away! There's a touch screen menu at your table where you can order ramen (I hear the black garlic ramen is great), udon, sashimi plates, and more. Once your special order is ready, it comes on this funny little train above you that tells your your is ready and starts singing and lights up.   You must, must try all the tacos, popcorn shrimp roll, and lobster roll. OMG!   I've lived around and this takes my top 5.",

    "text": "\"Vegas' first revolving sushi restaurant has arrived!\" is what I heard about Sapporo's opening.  This is a big deal!  Sushi on a conveyor belt?  How exciting, I must try!  However, it's not my first time seeing this concept and I had expectations going in.  I want to preface by first saying I've been to two amazing revolving sushi spots prior to my Sapporo visit: (1) in rural Fukuoka, Japan where most will eat sushi with their fingers, not chopsticks; and (2) Kula, a revolving sushi chain in SoCal and Texas.  Both of these were great and I thought nothing could be better, so I was carrying bias and was a little reluctant about Sapporo.  The food is fresh and nicely proportioned at $2.50 per plate.  If I wasn't very hungry this would be great place for a quick bite.  However, I suggest coming in for lunch like I did.  Prior to this lunch, I foolishly came starving for dinner on a Friday night and waited 30 minutes before leaving to eat somewhere else - Sapporo gets packed!  Knocked off at least one star for this: Sapporo's appeal is through its tech.  If it doesn't work properly, we don't get our food.  Aside from the belt, there's an iPad from which you can order additional items and on more than one instance, it would not take our order (see my attached photo).  When it does work, your order comes out on the top shelf, delivered to your table... but sometimes it goes to the wrong table like it did for one group next to us - they just watched their food go back and forth, passing them to another table.  At the end of the day, it's just another sushi spot.  This one just has the conveyor belt.  Game changer would be if this was AYCE.",

    "text": "Vegas surprisingly has really good sushi. Now this definitely is not top-tier sushi quality. But I would say it's the best revolving sushi I've been to outside of Japan.   Certain nigiri were better than others. We came in for Happy hour, which is pretty unbeatable price-wise at $1.50 a plate. But we noticed most the sushi that is discounted (conveyer belt only, can't be ordered) is probably the leftover stuff from earlier in the day. Because of this, you can definitely tell it's not as fresh as it should be. You can sometimes eyeball to see if it looks dry, but other times you can't. Also, a lot of the more premium sushi (like toro or sweet shrimp) won't be going around. So the conveyer belt sushi was a hit or miss.   The additional items were all really good , including the pork belly, some hand rolls, and the sashimi tacos.   If I'm looking for quantity over quality, I'd come here. You're paying just as much as you would at some AYCE places , with slightly better quality in my opinion, but less side options.",

I ordered the Orange Salmon which is an original at my personal favorite sushi spot. I would have gladly paid the few dollars more as Sapporo's orange supreme still included the orange membranes which made the experience less enjoyable. The black garlic ramen surprisingly was decent but don't hope for a generous portion of chashu. The bowl is about a half size and also half the price($4.25).  The place is clean, well decorated and aptly lit. The service was thorough and friendly. The novelty is the main attraction here and especially for Vegas, who doesn't enjoy little robots delivering your food? I know my toddler sure did.",

    "text": "So I've only given this restaurant 4 stars because I didn't get to try as many diverse items as possible. I ordered a couple apps, and tried a few specialty rolls.  The sushi was really good, you have the choice of picking it up from the conveyer belt or having it delivered to your table from ordering on the tablet. I noticed that when I ordered from the tablet my food was a lot warmer. Nonetheless, the plates on the conveyer belt are kept for 30 minutes and then new plates are placed afterward. Also, not every single item from the menu will be on the revolver, it was mostly nigiri and a few specialty rolls and appetizers. The most memorable appetizer I got was the shrimp taco, pictured, it was so delicious!  I'm making this my #1 for sushi, and reason being, 1. The food was great compared to other AYCE spots, 2. The prices are cheap, and 3. It's easier to keep track of how much you're eating so that you don't get too full or can't finish what you've ordered. The ambience is great for different occasions. The booths are quiet spacious, making it welcoming for large groups. The service was punctual, my waitress would always come by if I looked confused with the menu or tablet ordering. I will definitely return",

It has a train system we're you can pickup sushi but I probably just use the fast ordering system with the computer and your order gets delivered by a robot train thing. Overall this place is very clean, the waiters are patient and tend to check often. It is a little costly but it's worth the good food quality.",

I admit I accidentally took someone else's entree but the tray had no indication who's table ot was serving too because both lights were on leaving me confused and when the waiter came she was really rude even though i explained I would pay for it. Not only that the staff is really incompetent because when I asked for water they walked away not giving me service, I even asked if they sell tea and I got no responses and I felt ignored. This is a joke of a Japanese restaurant and a disgraced to all sushi resturaunts . the food was not bad but its definitely not worth the price or even with the shitty service your staff displayed. Ps. Tell your waiters to cut their nails because I got scratched by one of them which is really disgusting",

They were more than happy to explain not only the conveyor system but how to operate the tablet ordering system.      Now that I've raved about the staff let me praise the delicious food. After sampling just about everything the conveyor belt brought our way we never once had a single item that was anything but fresh and flavorful.      Vegas has many MANY sushi restaurants, and I have been to my fair share, but Sapporo deserves a place at the top. It combines the fun of the conveyor belt and the friendliness of eating at a dear friend's house.  ** HIGHLY RECOMMEND **",

They have a wide array of sushi selection, plus different kind of ramen and desserts. Most of all,  the place is nice, clientele is mostly 20s-40s, lively music",

Come to find out my friends love this spot because they only eat the fried dishes. I, on the other hand enjoy certain fresh fishes! As the food revolved I noticed the quality wasn't very great. So to play it safe i order tempura, and a ramen. I wanted to avoid getting sick.   I personally wouldn't recommend this place due to the the quality of food. However, the service was great.",

The plates that revolve are all $2.50!!! They have like 4 types of salmon, smoked, king, regular and belly! They have 3 pieces of of special sushi rolls! Everything I ate was amazing!!! They have Beautiful crafted alcoholic beverages and a bar you can sit at while waiting for your table! I seriously don't know why I didn't come here sooner! The sushi is fresh and innovative! They also have many other items on the menu that do not revolve around on the belt. Like made to order ramen and udon! Not just basic ramen but a bowl of black garlic ramen like you could find at minta or something. And it's only $4.25! And one things that I am sooo super excited about is that they have misoyaki butterfish!!!!! Also know as black cod marinated in miso. Wow! I am addicted and will come here always! I ordered a complete take out order that mirrored exactly what I ate while dining is! Sushi so good I wanted it for tomorrow too! I sipped on a ginza mule which consists of sake, vodka, fresh mint and ginger beer! Sooo refreshing and yummy!!!! It was only $8.00! The prices are amazing! Almost as if you are eating an all you can eat but way more quality and selection and funnnn!!!! Love it here! 5 stars!",

    "text": "I was pretty excited to hear of a revolving sushi here in Vegas.  My first experience was in Hawaii and I did enjoy it.  I had high expectations for this place, expecting a variety in appetizers and rolls.  I was expecting a few rolls similar to places where I get AYCE sushi.    It'll probably wow first timers.  I think this place is for only people who do not eat a lot of sushi or that does not do AYCE.   The waitress kindly explained how this all worked.  She even explained to us how after a plate has been on the conveyor belt for 30 minutes, it gets discarded and replaced which I think is good.   We had technical difficulties on the tablet a few minutes after using it.  I wished the tablet was swivel capable.  That way it can be turned to either side of the table.  They should include paper menu as well so that they are able to see what ingredients are in their sushi rolls instead of trying to read from afar and having the person closer to the tablet read it for you (I find it bothersome, especially when you're trying to eat).  With menus conveniently in front of you, you can figure out your order and have the person closest input the order instead of having that person scroll through each submenu to see what exist.  Coming from the islands, we know what fresh, good quality fish looks like and this place did not meet those standards.  Things that we tried: Hamachi & Salmon Tacos - I thought they were so cute. Popcorn Lobster Roll - I enjoyed it.  I like it because of the sauce they use on it.  I like spicy mayo. Gyoza - They were okay.  No different than any other place. Cheese Tonkatsu - To me, it was okay.  Its got chicken (at least I think it was chicken, could have been pork) mixed with cheese and then deep fried.   Lobster Roll - This was okay.  Probably taste the same as any other place.  I just wonder if they use real lobster.  Kind of looked like imitation crab on top. Surf and Turf - For me, it was okay.  Spicy for my liking.   Sexy Girl - I liked it, but I wish there wasn't any jalapenos in it.    ****That is one thing that you can't do on the tablet which is substitute/remove an ingredient from your roll**** (unless there is and the waiter just didn't tell us)  And that was about it.  This was sharing amongst 3 people.  We didn't have much.  Our bill was a little over $50.    So with that being said, Happy Eating's!",

This is a similar set up to Kula Revolving Sushi Bar in Cupertino, CA but minus the super cute anime and reward system - no toys here :(   The fish is fresh, however it lacks in options. Many have fried shrimp tempura or california roll (fake crab/mayonnaise) incorporated in them.  This concept is great to introduce someone to sushi or get them excited about it, like your kid, but otherwise the novelty is gone after one visit.  Service: friendly and efficient. You don't really need a waiter other than for drinks since you grab your own food.  Ambiance: casual and clean  Location: convenient parking. Located across the street from Ronald's Donuts (yum).

The nigiri was warm imagine warm raw fish in your mouth *yuck!  I had to switch spots with my husband to keep an eye on the fresh sushi plates the chef in the kitchen are putting on the belt to avoid grabbing a piece that's been sitting on the conveyer for a while. They need to put Sushi on a chilled plate to keep the temperature control. This is important esp knowing how hot our summers are here & people can get sick eating warm raw seafood. This should be fixed IMMEDIATELY!!  Service was excellent everyone was friendly with a happy smile on their face.  Fish quality- i would give a C+ but for $2.50 a plate I didn't expect Nobu Or Raku quality. I'm also not a fan of AYCE due to the lack of quality.  Please use chilled plates or else i see trouble with food poisoning claims in the near future. All in all I would come again with friends for the experience but I wouldn't recommend this for someone that's craving great quality sushi!",

There is also a train that brings other items that you order from and iPad. The items on the iPad range from different prices depending on what you get.

I love that you can try so many different things since each plate is just a few pieces of something, and if you find something you really like you can just order a full roll. $2.50 per plate is pretty reasonable, and I definitely plan to try their happy hour where everything is $1.50 per plate. I was actually impressed with the quality of the fish, especially the salmon- they had 3 different kinds! I really like this place and can't wait to come back!",

I love that we don't have to wait for the food and most items were very fresh. What I would recommend for newbies of revolving sushi is to sit closer to the kitchen where the belt starts so that you get first pick. We sat at the very end and we ate some where the rice was a little dry and we had to wait until the Sapporo roll would come back around to us. I think everyone loves white tuna and Sapporo roll because they were scarce. Overall, I'll definitely go back with friends because it was new and enjoyable dining experience.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here on a Saturday night expecting it was going to be busy. Turns out there was no wait so we were seated right away. Living in Hawaii we were already used to the conveyor belt system, since we were so obsessed with Genki Sushi in Oahu, so it wasn't as amusing for us. It's nice to have one here in Vegas though.   As we walked in, the restaurant looked very clean and interior decorations were nice. I wasn't craving sushi at all that night and not being able to eat raw food, I didn't enjoy the food as much as my fiance did. He ordered most of the plates that were very popular on yelp like the orange salmon, uni, sashimi, toro, blue fin tuna, etc, which were pretty high quality, fresh and so tasty he said. I ordered the ramen which was great for the price, and very flavorful. The rolls were decent like any other sushi place. One thing I really liked is how they have smaller portions of the rolls in the conveyor belt rather than paying $7-$12 for the full roll. Which I think was very clever of them.   I'm giving 4 stars because as for service, the first waitress we had didn't bring us water, she seemed too busy walking around chatting with other workers. We had to ask another waiter to bring us glass of water and to ask to take our plates because it was getting a little cramped. Our first waitress finally came around our table but didn't even check up on us, she only came by to take some of our plates and wipe down the table next to us.  Since I didn't eat much and my fiance ate like we were at an AYCE, we did pay a little bit more than expected. My only advice is, do not take your other half here if she/he is very very VERY hungry! Or You'll be paying more than an All You Can Eat bill. Other than that, it was a nice experience.",

Keep an eye out for the black garlic tuna because that is one you want to keep having on your table. You grab a plate from the belt and your bill totals to however many plate you have on the table. You can also order on their digitalized menu, which gives you pictures for the dishes as well as the sushi on the belt. Highly recommend the black garlic ramen. I swear, that bowl alone can open it's own ramen house. Once you order from the menu, a \"robot\" zips on top of the belt and stops at your table to serve it. Really great, really cute. The servers are also very attentive to every table. I deducted one star from it because of the sushi to rice ratio, which I feel is important with sushi places. While not horrible, the fish slices were a little smaller and thinner than I would like. Also, the place is not really great for large parties. If you're a party of more than 6, be prepared to sit on opposite sides of the restaurant. That being said though, I would definitely come back.",

Well, I was happy to find both of those concerns unfounded!  Everything we tried was fresh and the variety of what they put out was surprisingly good.  There were a few items, like Japanese mackerel, that you'd be hard pressed to find at most other restaurants.  Plus, I loved the fact that you can just eat as little or as much as you want for a reasonable price, instead of doing the \"all you can eat\" thing.

It's neat if you don't know what you want since you can pick a plate off the belt and try different sushi.   The quality of the sushi taste amazing! They have a good amount of variety on the belt. You'll find some specialty rolls to nigiri and some desserts! If you want to order a entire roll let's say for a dragon roll, you can place the order on the iPad that is on the table. While on it you can order which ever sushi you crave for or something different. I also ordered their tonkotsu ramen. Their ramen is served in a small bowl and it's simple. You got your broth, ramen, a slice of Chasu, and some bamboo shoot.   Careful with eating off the revolving belt since it's $2.50 a plate and it adds up pretty quick haha. Their service there is fast, keeping up with how fast I'll be stacking the lids of the plate!",

First off, this is a really cool place for sushi lovers to try as it is the first conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Las Vegas!

You can also order nigiri, sushi rolls, and other small entrees off of the iPad menu as well. Once it is ordered, a robotic trolley delivers your food. One of my favorite dishes is the Tuna Tartar and surprisingly their garlic ramen is very delicious as well! I've never had a problem as customer service is great, and the waiters are very nice.

    "text": "I usually have a rule of threes. If I've visited a place three times, I leave a review! However, I've slacked and have actually been to Sapporo at least a dozen times since I've moved here half a year ago. Oops! Sapporo is definitely a \"bang for your buck\" type of place. It's also a very fun place to bring people who have never had revolving sushi before! At $2.50 a plate, you really couldn't ask for a better price. I have had some phenomenal fish here, and some good fish here, it depends on your preference I guess.  This place can get really, really busy, but the longest I have had to wait was 30 minutes I believe. That was during their late night happy hour (10-11 PM depending on the day of the week) where their plates are reduced to $1.50 a plate! I had always seen their happy hour but assumed it was reduced prices because they were just cycling through what was left.  Boy, was I wrong! It's like a whole different session of them preparing for a second dinner rush it seems. Having only been here a little while, they have managed to gain notoriety for their incredible happy hour and people will specifically line up out the door for their happy hour prices. Sapporo is great because as soon as you sit down, you can (pretty much) start eating once your server brings out the wasabi and ginger. I have managed to sit down, start eating, and be done in about 15 minutes when I was in a hurry but needed to eat. The wonders of revolving, self-service sushi! They also have an iPad for things you want to order, whether it be because someone keeps snapping up ALL the red snapper with yuzu and fresh wasabi (guilty) or because you want to order something that doesn't actually come on the belt! My boyfriend has ordered their ramen and their black garlic oil ramen is to die for. They have a standalone ramen location, but it's too far from where we live- so $4 for a bowl of ramen at our favorite sushi place is unreal! Unreally awesome. Also, parking here is tough because they have a pretty full shopping center, but once those businesses are closed, there's nobody that is going to be the tow police and tell on you- but also just don't be afraid to park anywhere- no matter the time of day. If you want a new experience at an affordable price, come to Sapporo for delicious sushi!",

One of our members wanted to get some of the wall decorations for his home.  :)  There are conveyor belts full of sushi.  There are chips in the dishes so they know how long the sushi has been sitting on the belt.  There are little robot trays that sends your special orders to you.  You order your specialty items from the iPads.  There is a bar near the entrance where we ordered hot sake as we waited for our table.  The sushi was fresh and excellent.  Take it from us, we eat sushi every week without fail.  I especially liked the salmon belly, o toro, and uni.  The black garlic ramen was phenomenal according to several of our members.

Those orders will roll out on a separate cart system so everything is super efficient.",

Not only was the fish not fresh at all (the yellowtail actually tasted really old, and their staff did nothing but not charge for that plate and kept the others in rotation... real safe) but the plates cost varying amounts which can be very expensive very quickly.  The selection was okay, which is really the only positive I can say. Fish was 'okay' at best, staff was inattentive and rude, and our bill was costly with far inferior quality compared to other places right in the same area. Konbea is ayce but terrible selection, and Kura is way bigger selection, high quality and very nice staff.  Skip this place unless you want possible food poisoning. First revolving sushi in Vegas, but sometimes older isn't better.",

The format is fun and makes for great Instagram posts. Gotta do it for the Gram! The rolls on the conveyor belt were okay, but I preferred the rolls ordered from the tablet and delivered on the tram. I also wish there were more roll options, as there weren't any baked rolls (only rolls with certain ingredients that were baked). The nigiri on the belts were excellent. The sushi is a good value, with most plates having three pieces of sushi or two pieces of nigiri. At $2.50 a plate, it works out to $7.50 per roll. Since it isn't AYCE, I was able to enjoy the sushi at a good price without having to push myself to eat my money's worth. I still prefer a great AYCE spot over Sapporo, but if I want sushi at a good price and don't want AYCE, I would definitely come here again.",

There wasn't much seating for large groups, so we had to wait (They asked if we would be ok sitting at separate tables near each other which was kinda funny, but I guess it's cool to have an option). Another group of 6 walked in about 10min after us and after waiting 30min, they were seated before us.  Frustrating.  We showed the employees our name on the list and they apologized for the mistake.  Food was great, 5-star quality.   Wanting to try the place again, my wife said she'd be down for the late night happy hour if they have it on the weekends.  Website is not functioning after months of being open and restaurant didn't answer their phones despite calling multiple times.  No way for me to find out about happy hour.  Very annoying.  Decided not to go  Food is 5-stars.  Waitress wasn't very good, hosts made mistakes and were MIA for some time when we first arrived, website is down, didn't answer phone after several attempts to call over a 30min period.  An unfortunate experience with multiple problems despite the food being very good.",

Plates are only $2.50 each, and yeah that can add up but it's definitely worth it! First of all, you don't have to wait for your food to come because it comes to you. From California rolls to salmon to shrimp tacos to specialty rolls, there's rolls for days! The sushi tasted good and I love how fresh the raw fish tasted! You can also order full rolls ($7.50 each) and other entrees (ramen, sides, desserts) on the touchscreen and a robot tray will bring it out to you in about 15 minutes.   Definitely recommend this spot if you're craving some sushi. Really good place for groups. The only reason this place didn't get a full 5 stars is because of the dirty look one of the waitresses gave. We gave a decent tip so I don't understand why. She literally didn't even do much because we grabbed the food ourselves; all she did was bring out the drinks and gave us the check so she should just be glad she got something. Other than that, this place was dope!",

They DO NOT have AYCE but I think that it made the experience better.   When we sit at our table, our server asked us if we had ever been there before. Since we hadn't, he explained how things worked. The plates traveling around on the conveyor belt are all $2.50 a piece. There is also a touch screen tablet on the table with the full menu. You can order anything from the tablet and it will be delivered to you via another conveyor belt. That part was the coolest! We kept ordering from the touch screen just so we could keep getting the little car sent to us. :)  The food, AMAZING! The quality of the fish was LEGIT, probably since its not an AYCE place and they can afford better fish but omgosh! We stuck with mostly nigiri that night with my favorite being the New Zealand King Salmon! I had like 5 orders of that fish! There were so many pretty items that looked delicious to choose from it was hard to settle on what we did.  I definitely want to come back here with my dad, partner, son, friends, family, cousins, lol I don't care with who, I am just going back. I highly highly recommend this place. I couldn't even take pictures cause I was too busy stuffing my face. :)",

We even ordered from the little machines they have at the tables for other items like hand rolls, soups, and desserts. They all came out in a timely manner and tasted great! I would highly recommend the salmon belly, the lobster roll, and the rainbow roll from the conveyor belt. Also, the udon noodles and the creme brulees when you order from the machine!  Our server was very kind and checked up on us during our meal. She even came and asked us if we haven't received items we ordered from the little machine on the tables so that she could check in the kitchen for us about its progress! Overall a really great experience, would definitely come back if I was ever in Vegas again.",

I had never been so happy to see quick and fresh food.   When we got there, they were still setting up rows of booths and waiting for people to determine which ones to open up. It was about a ten minute wait.   For happy hour, all the dishes on the conveyor belt and some alcohol was discounted. If you order from the the screen, then you will pay full price for those items. Most of the special rolls on the belt were delicious. I don't remember their names, but it wasn't your typical dragon roll.  The staff was super attentive and quick. I was very impressed. We could flag someone down easily.  This restaurant is stylish; the food is delicious; the staff are wonderful. I love this place. Do yourself a favor and take a uber/lyft off the strip here.",

    "text": "I stopped by Sapporo on a Saturday late afternoon for a quick lunch. The wait was about 10 minutes. Two revolving belts were open. Seating is primarily near the belts in a booth set up. Each table has a screen where you can order food, but sushi is also offered on the belt. The replenishment of sushi on the belt was rather slow, so I had to order most of my food.   While food appeared to be fresh, it did not taste as great as it should. My Philly roll just seemed to be off, I could not really point my finger what was wrong with it, but I did not enjoy it as much as I normally do.  The atmosphere at the restaurant was not really pleasant either. It had a diner-type feel, which is different from a lounge setting that you'd normally see in a sushi restaurant. Service was pleasant and relatively fast, and the checkout process painless. Overall, not sure that I would be back because of the atmosphere and food.",

Nigiri was awesome! Favorite definitely included salmon, yellowtail, baby yellowtail, tuna, bluefin tuna, and a mix of rolls to choose from including bbq eel on the rotation. Also had a la cart for $2.50 too. Draft beer $2.50. Wished the revolving part had more choices. Got 1 piece a la cart uni which wasn't that great and was kind of old, and also had a bit of sand or sea urchin shell in it or something. Overall a great experience. Owned by the same group that owns a few other places including master Kim's kbbq which is also awesome and they're definitely getting this casual-upscale asian dining cuisine down to a science.",

These guys hit the revolving sushi concept well.  The kicker here is that black garlic ramen. It was honestly amazing and shits on jinyas tonkatsu Black if you're familiar. Like all the other reviews I'm coming back just for this.  Regular and special roll quality are good and portioned well fish to rice wise. Seared garlic tuna and sexy mama were my usual plates I kept grabbing. With hand rolls at $2.95 you can't help but indulging in a stuffed spicy crab or even salmon skin roll to make sure you get your gluttony fix on.",

Employees had great customer service & made sure we were ok.   Food - AMAZING. They offer different varieties of sushi, ramen & other cooked items. This place is very affordable ($2.50) for items on the belt. But they also had other items $2.50& up but was totally worth it. The fish was fresh & the ramen was so big and delicious for ($4.50). I HIGHLY recommend the orange salmon. It was so gooooood! I had the black garlic & tonkatsu ramen and they were almost as good as monta ramen! But with lesser toppings.  I would recommend this place if you want cheap sushi or if you can't choose between sushi or ramen! I'll be coming back for more orange salmon!!",

    "text": "Finally we got one in Vegas!!   Concept is fun and cool! Got several different sushi's off the belt. Toro was pretty good but I felt like the blue fin was a miss today.   I ordered salmon from the tablet and I also got salmon from the belt. I'd say that it is probably better to have it ordered versus taken off the belt. The fish was fresh.   ORANGE SALMON!!! Get it!! Do not regret this dish. My absolute favorite. BOMB!! Get like two of these!!!  This was just the soft opening. It's pretty ok and service was not bad. Just when we got to checks it took a while because we had a party of 7 and then spilt check 4 ways.   2.50 per plate isn't a bad price either. But I think we ate about the same price as AYCE.   Uni was deliciouuuuusssss!!! That nice orange color and yumminess.   Overall, I'd come back if I wasn't too hungry. I believe that it is fairly priced and I love the concept but hopefully the freshness doesn't go away because most revolving sushi I've had eventually ends up gross but so far so good!",

    "text": "Las Vegas finally has their on revolving sushi restaurant, Sapporo! It's a relatively new place when this blog is posted.  My first conveyor belt sushi experience took place in Japan. The restaurant I went to was called '(/Kaiten Sushi)'; '(/Kaiten)' means 'rotation' so 'Rotation Sushi'.  Sushi are placed on top of a conveyor belt and it moves through the restaurant while the customers can just easily take whatever they fancy. Unlike Japan, all the plates on the conveyor belt are $2.50. You can use the screens they have at each table to order a specific order and those prices varies.  The Sushi was fresh and had a good amount portion of fish. Salmon is my go to fish and it was delicious! I enjoyed the sushi. They have some special rolls in either two to four pieces, then if you want an actual full roll you can special order it on the touch pad.   My friend and I each got full from 7 conveyor belt plates and the price was $18.94 which is a pretty good price for us since it's similar amount to an ayce sushi restaurant.  One thing, I checked their yelp for their address, but it lead me to a different location then the actually restaurant. Luckily, it was close by to where the yelp address lead me. Sapporo is on Spring Mountain, past Arville, but before you hit the Decatur's traffic light. It is located right next to Hotai Furniture, so I recommend looking up Hotai Furniture to make it more easier to locate Sapporo.",

Inside there 3 different conveyor belts that have sushi going around.  There's a little label that tells you what sushi is coming up.    The best sushi here is the Toro & the popcorn lobster.  The Toro is super fatty and buttery and melts in your mouth!  The popcorn lobster is tempura fried lobster on top of a Cali roll and with spicy mayo.  The owner gave us their garlic ramen on the house and that was really good as well.  The best part about this place is that you can still order off of the tablet located at each table.  A little electronic cart that comes out to your table.  You pay based off of how many plates you pull of the conveyor belt.  $2.50 each plate that consist of either 1 or 2 pieces of nigiri or 3/4 pieces of a roll.  The orders you place through the tablet are a little more pricier because they are full rolls/hand rolls/dishes.  Check this place out it's a cool experience for sure & the food isn't bad!",

The late night one runs Sunday-Thursday 10pm to Close and Friday-Saturday 11pm to Close.  We came on a Monday night right at 10pm. There was plenty of parking at that time. There is a clipboard at the front and we signed ourselves in. A lot of parties started to come and sign in right behind us. We were seated within 10 minutes.  There were a good amount of options on the conveyer belt. Some of my favorites I picked off the line were the garlic tuna, pepper tuna and Sexy Girl. There is also a tablet on the table where you can order off the menu. A little robot brings it to your table on top of the conveyer belt. I ordered the Black Garlic Ramen and it was amazing!! The broth was velvety and it had lots of garlic for all of you garlic lovers.  I thought the service was great. Our drinks were never empty. Our water was always refilled. The server comes by when you're finished to tally up your plates so they can bring you your bill (I believe you can ask for you check via the tablet and the server then will come by). I liked that I didn't have to be bothered by a server unless I really needed them. There's minimal human interaction here which I really liked.",

    "text": "Finally a revolving sushi restaurant in Vegas! I've been to several of them in other states so I was excited to finally get one out here. We went in on a late Friday evening. The wait wasn't too long, less than 20 minutes.   Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50 and you can order other items from the tablet at your table. I took several items off the belt and also ordered from the tablet.   Conveyor belt items - Snow crab nigiri - crab was sweet and tasted fresh Popcorn lobster roll - covered in mayo/sauce, heavily breaded Lobster roll - doused in a sweet sauce, couldn't taste anything else Seaweed salad - refreshing, good quality and flavor California roll - had a generous amount of crab Gyoza - greasy and soggy, flavor was good Shrimp taco - shrimp was in a tart mayo/sauce?, wasn't into it Tuna taco - like poke in a tortilla chip shell, delicious, would eat a whole tray of them  Tablet items -  Udon soup - broth was really sweet for some reason, wouldn't order it again Vanilla ice cream - this was a big \"womp, womp\" for us. We put in the order for the ice cream on our tablet. Then the waiting game began. 5, 10, 15 minutes went by. Someone finally stopped at our table and asked if we ordered vanilla ice cream. I said yes, but we hadn't gotten it yet. Another few minutes went by until we finally got our bowl of ice cream. Strangely, the person brought it to us from the front of the house so I'm not really sure where they store their ice cream. My kiddo was kind of bummed it didn't come out on the automated tray that runs above the conveyor belt. C'est la vie.   The service was pretty good for a busy Friday evening. Staff was attentive and we didn't feel rushed even though there was still a line of people waiting to be seated. This experience was a little rough but I'd give it another shot. There are tons of items we didn't get to try so we'll be back again.",

    "text": "Las Vegas' FIRST conveyor belt sushi restaurant!   Came here tonight with some friends and my husband. It was their soft pre-opening or something? Apparently they were opened the last two nights as well but it was invite only. I'm super jealous that some people got invited!   I saw on Facebook that they were opened for a limited time on Dec. 2nd for dinner 5:00 pm - 10:00 pm. When I saw that, I immediately showed it to my friends and husband, planned for an early dinner at 5:00 pm. The parking situation is a little weird because they had a lot of parking spots but a lot of them had names of other establishments or they had the word \"reserved\" on them. Except there's a sign in front of Sapporo saying that you can park anywhere. Sooooo not really sure how that really goes.  We got there a bit early and got seated right away. They told us already that the food won't come out until 5:00 pm and we were fine with that. They have an iPad system on all the tables where you can order things if you don't want to grab it from the conveyor belt. The iPad also keeps a tally of all the things you ordered, which is great.   As you can probably tell by now, they have a conveyor belt with different types of nigiri. They even have signs before them so you know what you're grabbing. What I did notice is that the sushi starts in the middle of the room before making it to the other side, which kind of sucks because if there was something we wanted ... but everyone else also wanted, we wouldn't be able to get it. We could order it .. but we also noticed that the fish isn't consistent. Some pieces would be fattier and other pieces would be more lean. There wasn't enough salmon on the conveyor belt for us so we had to order two more orders but they came out quite lean. We like our fatty salmon belly pieces! Booo!   Also, for the ordering system, they have a custom cart that stops right in front of your table with your order when it's ready. It also tells you, \"Your order is here. Please take your order.\" Super cool. It reminds me of some of the sushi places in Japan that does that.   Onto the sushi! We focused mainly on the nigiris. They have rolls too. Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50. They have hand rolls too but you have to order them. They weren't on the belt. They are also $2.50. They have udon and ramen to order. The nigiri are mostly two pieces to a plate unless you get the premium items: toro, king crab, uni. Those are one piece per plate for $2.50. Honestly, toro for that price is a STEAL. Most establishments charge $8-10 for one piece of toro. The sushi is quite fresh. I think the only thing I didn't care for is the rice. It was good but it was missing something. They also packed it a lot where it doesn't feel as soft -- felt a bit more hard and squished.   Don't worry about the fish staying out too long. Their conveyor belt has senors whenever a plate gets put on there. They have a timer for it so if a plate has been on the belt for 30 minutes and hasn't been eaten, it will be trashed!  You keep the plates at your table so at the end of your meal, they can tally it up and give you your total. Service was great -- they were willing to split our check in anyway we want!   TIP: If you're a huge eater, this may not be the place for you. These things can add up fast. I would suggest you do AYCE if you eat a ton. Haha.   This place brings back memories of when I used to have the boat sushi back in San Francisco with my mom and grandma.   Overall, decent quality. Good service. I would come back :) And would suggest people give it a try.",

I personally loved that when you ordered a dish that came directly from the kitchen, a robot would bring it to you. So fun! The place was very busy when we got there and we didn't have a reservation as they said they couldn't take anymore of them but to show up and they could seat us, so we did. Granted it was late evening on Valentine's Day and we went on a whim but they had a great little bar with a variety of drinks to keep us busy while we waited and the staff were so friendly and helpful, allowing us to sample sakes to make sure we bought our favourite. Will definitely return!",

Sapporo Sour was my choice, It's basically a mock Pisco, but vegan friendly- chick pea juice. Just try it   Then let's talk food, I'm vegan, I have plenty of choices, udon, fried peppers, cucumber rolls, and seaweed salad I grabbed from the bar which was so fresh and so good.   My boyfriend eats meat and he said his JJ roll was to die for, he also had scallops and Sapporo (the beer) to wash it all down.  I had Ashai beer which it's pretty great that they have both on tap.  Love this place!",

We just discovered that they also have a happy hour starting at 11:00pm where the revolving plates are only $1.50 each and Sapporo beer is also half off. If you a hankering for sushi late at night, or you wanna take your family who's in town, you are in luck, Sapporo is the place for you.",

If you're not familiar with you eating sushi, it's a great place to start because if you don't know what order, you can just look at the conveyor belt and pick the type of sushi you want. Everything is clearly marked. In addition to sushi on the conveyor belt, you can also order specialty items via an iPad ordering system. The system crashed a few times for me but it quickly restarted.The items ordered from the ordering system came via separate robotic delivery system. Overall service is great; staff was great. This isn't an ACTE place but the sushi on the conveyer belt was $2.50/plate; the speciality items started at $2.50 and went up from there. The sushi was good, not great but not bad. My total bill was about $40 so it's what I would expect eating sushi. The entertainment value of the restaurant is worth a visit.",

They have a great variety of rolls and the ramen is delicious too. Will be going back a lot!",

My boyfriend thought that was such a blast that he just kept ordering to see the roomba bring the food out! The revolving sushi has so much to choose from and the little plates are only $2.50 a piece so it really allows you to just try a little bit of everything. When it came to the sushi rolls the selection was a little weird such as their surf and turf but nonetheless good. The only complaint that I would have is that they leave the white plates on your table because they tally them up to finalize your bill. For example, $2.50 x 10 = $25. So it's kinda annoying that they take up space on the able. My only advice for you is that $2.50 starts to add up super quick once you get going!",

If you order from the kitchen be sure to ask them to send it out on the little mouse droid that reminds me of Star Wars.  It is a cute touch.  The sushi is better than average for a conveyor belt sushi place.  It isn't a significant drop in quality like a lot of others with the same model.  Still, if you want the freshest, order from the kitchen or go to a more typical sushi bar.  The other menu items were good too.  I especially liked the pork belly although one of the pieces was a little dry, the other two were perfect.  I'll be back!",

The place was huge too, and inside was really modern and clean. It was interesting to see sushi on the conveyer belt. We asked for small bowls so that we can pour some soy sauce. That small bowls were a bit dusty, and let server know. Server was very apologetic and changed our bowls. Overall, I had amazing experience to dine here and look at the conveyer belt running near me. We ended up getting a lot of food and our bill was around 65 dollars which was decent.  Pros :  You can have small portion of everything like buffet does You maybe able to see actual presentation of the food unlike all you can eat place or other place since it has been placed on the belt Tastes really good Interesting to see conveyer belt running near you if it is your first time Fresh ingredient for sure since the turnover was pretty high and busy Server was attentive  Cons : If you eat A LOT, like really A Lot; well I consider myself to eat a lot too, of course all you can eat place will be a better choice for you since bill stacks really easy and quick  If you are looking for everything taken care of fine dining service, since this place is mostly served on your own, it may not be good place fore you. But again, it will still be great experience for sure",

Yes, the prices are decent for the dishes on the conveyor belt and even better for the night happy hour.

    "text": "I typically come here pretty often for the happy hour and the more often I come I notice they always stop making the salmon sushi or higher priced dishes and place out the cheaper fishes such as mackerel or less popular dishes. For the first time I came at 12:30 am and there was only 1 salmon. I asked if they could bring a plate of the salmon out and they told me that they would have to charge me regular price and blamed it on \"its close to closing\" when they close at 2am... So obviously that was lie and were just being cheap. The yellowtail that I picked out to try since nothing good was coming out, tasted like it was out for awhile and was even warm... I'm pretty sure that is not what raw fish temperature is suppose to be. Probably last time I go there. Thanks Sapporo!",

    "text": "Sapporo is definitely worth checking out for the experience of revolving/conveyer belt sushi. If you're looking for super fancy rolls, this is probably not your place - instead, Sapporo focuses on the simple: delicious pieces of nigiri and simple rolls with only a handful of specialty rolls. For its simplicity, the food is done well and is reasonably priced at $2.50 per plate off the conveyer belt. Most plates come with 2 pieces of nigiri or as 3 pieces of a roll, making it perfect for trying a lot of different dishes to find your favorites. If you don't see a dish that you want, you can also order off of their iPad menu which offers larger specialty rolls, sashimi, tempura, ramen, and desserts (ranging from $4.95-10). A small car-like robot will deliver it direct to your table!  Our favorites from the night were:  1) Salmon belly - so fatty and melts in your mouth 2) Salmon and shrimp tacos - mini fried wonton tacos with a mixture of salmon or shrimp in a creamy sauce; easy to eat in one bite 3) Garlic tuna - tuna nigiri with fried garlic on top with a peppery sesame sauce 4) Bluefin tuna - definitely worth $2.50 for 1 piece (one of the few plates that only comes as 1 piece of nigiri) 5) Popcorn lobster roll - basic crab roll topped with tempura fried lobster with a yummy mix of creamy and eel sauce   Service is fast, and the waitstaff is nice! At the end of your meal, they tally up your plates in addition to the food you order off the iPad. Overall, a fun and good experience - I would definitely go back!",

Not stellar, but it's fresh and it's made the way it's supposed to be made. This is great if you're hungry and would like a little bit of sushi, or would like a variety and you are on your own...since the plates are small, it's perfect for that. You get about 3 pieces of a roll on a plate for $2.50....unless it's nigiri then it's like 1. But they have toro, yum. If you have a table full of people, like me, all 4 kids came...I don't think it's worth it....I think my bill at sushi fever is about the same.  The novelty of the belt was fun. Supposedly you can custom order something off the iPad and have a robot deliver it to your table. Well....he's been broken. The table behind us were pretty upset about it. But I think the servers were pretty fast in replacing the robot.  We ordered a roll on the iPad, the kids loved a Mexican roll on the conveyor belt so we ordered a full one in the iPad, so this concept is great for people to taste before they commit to a full roll....taste off the belt, love it? Then order a big one from the iPad.  We ordered a tonkatsu dish...fried and rolled with cheese in the middle....highly recommend. And the udon noodles were really good too.  The service was great, drinks always full, the table always clean. I'd come here again for and of the good reasons I've mentioned above.",

I was expecting a lot more since the ratings were so high but the sushi was not quality enough for me to really enjoy it, to be \"wow'ed\".   For the most part, their selections tasted kind of stale; as if they had been sitting there for a long time- that or the fish they used was not treated well. It was bland and chewy.  Arguably, the $1.50 happy hour was a good deal. But I've had way better sushi for the same price. Guess I was expecting it to at least be better than your average Japanese restaurant, guess not.   Make sure you come at 10 if you want a bang for your buck. They won't count any of the plates you ate at 9:45 for happy hour.",

The concept is familiar in areas like San Francisco, so I was excited to see some parts of that concept being brought to Vegas. They pretty much nailed that part at Sapporo. However, I feel as though their quality in taste needs some work.  Because it's a la carte, I would expect everything to be at it's best, as you would do if you're paying 2.50 for two pieces of fish. However, I was kind of disappointed; there really isn't anything special about the fish, and if you're looking fish with more quality for the price, then I suggest AYCE would be a better choice. I don't mind it being expensive, but if it is, might as well be worth every penny right? Unfortunately, this selection did not offer that case.  My favorite sushi dishes from this place was Salmon Belly and Uni. Both were memorably fresh and mouth watering.  My favorite from there was not the sushi, but the black garlic ramen was exceptionally good, and a taste that I haven't tried out from other place. Definitely give that one a go.  There was also this dish that you could order, I forgot the name but it has clams in it. Please save yourself some money and don't get that. It has a bunch of flavored water surrounding it that was completely unnecessary, and the taste was just salty rather than savory.   Overall, give this place one visit to satisfy your curiosity. But after that, maybe just for the Black Garlic Ramen?",

The three of us were pleasantly surprised at how good and reasonably priced the food really was!  The concept of choosing dishes as they course through on a conveyor belt is fairly novel.  Besides those food items coursing around on a conveyor belt, a large iPad device helps you place an order based on a menu that breaks down everything in several categories including items made to order from the kitchen.  Your server can be a human or a robotic cart that delivers directly to your table!  We ordered the black garlic ramen soup (large bowl and savory!), Philadelphia rolls, seaweed salad and vegetable tempura.  This restaurant is super clean and the servers, both living and robotic, were very prompt!  This is a super nice place for families, friends and parties!  We were told that this truly unique place is about a year old.  You will definitely not feel sticker shock ordering food here!  The dishes on the conveyor belt are very inexpensive.  The items on the extensive iPad menu have a great range of prices that won't break the bank!",

Don't hate me *i actually don't eat fish* I go for other options, as my friends love sushi, they had plenty of my favorites. Garlic edamame was too spicy for me, but I'm also a whimp.

Ramen/Udon was hand delivered by staff.   The sushi was good, you can tell the nigiri and rolls were made to order by the temp/texture of the rice. My parents had a ball especially over the salmon sashimi and they especially enjoyed the orange salmon. They kept raving about the freshness of their fish which is also nice to hear. Throughout the whole time, the staff would check up on us which is great especially since this restaurant is kind of DIY. Awesome place, would visit again next time I'm craving sushi but don't want to do AYCE in the Vegas area.",

Worth the trip if you are looking for something new to do in town.  You can either choose a selection of sushi from the revolving plates that pass your table like the trolley on mister Roger's neighborhood or there is a digital menu at each table to special order food along with the waiter to help guide you through this experience.   They had a nice selection of plates for $2.50 a piece - the service was awesome. It was a bit busy but we got their before the crowd.  The only wait was on me - trying to figure out what I wanted to eat - if you are indecisive you maybe waiting for the right dish that catches your eye. It's your standard dishes but you can make special requests through the waiter.    Great for families and out of town guest - technology fused with dining experience",

    "text": "I have been to other revolving sushi restaurants in other cities, so this is not new to me.  I really liked that it was on a track vs floating on water too.  I had the black garlic ramen and oh my it was DELICIOUS!  The menu prices were good and I definitely didn't think anything was over priced.  Their sushi menu was nothing to get excited about though, it was a little small however the few plates I tried were good.  The rolls on the plates were a little small too.    When I ordered a specific roll, it got delivered to my table on a little flat mobile trolly type device. It was pretty neat but after I took my plate off of it, it kept telling me to take my plate. It took me several seconds before I realized I was supposed to push the button on it, to send the device back.    This place definitely missed the mark on 1 important thing. The table tablet display.  It was bolted to the far end of the table, and couldn't be rotated or angled at all.  I was dining by myself and even I had trouble viewing it and ordering from it, because it wasn't facing ME.  The tablet also couldn't accept any form of payment.  Go to Olive Garden and check out their table tablet display. It's mobile and anyone at the table can use it and see it.  You can also pay by card with it.    Considering this is the first revolving sushi restaurant in vegas, they did a nice job.  I would however consider it on the low end of quality and technology compared to other revolving sushi restaurants out there in other cities and japan.     Over all, nice place and I would come back it.",

    "text": "First revolving... conveyor belt.. Japanese style sushi place.. and yep, i am truly a fan! centrally located in the asian parts of las vegas and it wasnt really hard to find. parking is easy, but i can see it getting packed during the rush hours. i walked right in and noticed immediately that this place is going to be interesting. not so congested sitting area as they have booth style seating which could fit 6 average size adults comfortably next to the belts. servers are very friendly although they didnt really explain how the process works. luckily i have been to other conveyor belt style sushi places in hawaii and japan so i knew how it worked. basically there are pre made dishes on the belt that you can grab at anytime and feast. if you dont see anything you want or something you want more of.. you can use the tablet that is stationed on the table to order your food.. you can also request more water from the tablet also... everything on the belt is $2.50.. while the price seems low (ive seen lower) the plates can really start adding up to hefty check.. food quality was great as you really dont know how long the dishes have been sitting on the belt.. (im guessing 30 mins tops - before they discard it).. but if you order from the tablet.. it will be freshly made and shuttled over to you by a small cart that zooms on top of the belts and straight to your table.. (pretty cool - if its your first time experiencing it).. other than that.. i would eventually make my way there again.. and hopefully next time they have added additional items...  enjoy!",

It didn't stand out in my mind and there isn't even a roll that I could recommend because it was just average. Surprisingly my favorite items were the little tacos they had. We ordered those for delivery on the little trolley thing which was pretty cool. This place is more for the experience rather than the food.

Your bill could be double want you normally spend. Two of us spent over $40 without alcohol, but we were still hungry after we left. My suggestion to the restaurant, the price should be lower or the size should be bigger.  This place is more for rich Asian people or people with small appetite.",

Although if you prefer to wait you can also order through their tablet. The only downside to this cool place is the price. It's pretty fun grabbing plate after plate but once you're full, settled, and ready to receive your check; the sudden realization of the mountain stacked plates looms over you as you check the price to pay. I'd recommend this place if you like sushi in general.",

I also tried new rolls that I never tried just because it's on the conveyer. The sushi was great, it's definitely better than ayce places. The best part, I thought my bill was going to be higher because it wasn't a ayce, but it actually was less than what I pay for at a conveyer. They also got these delivery cars, and that was definitely different and neat. The servers were on point, and overall I had a great experience. I'll definitely be back",

There are 3 to 4 pieces on each plate or you can also pick from desserts and seaweed salad as well as fish tacos. The sushi is good, there is better sushi and other places but considering those prices it is really awesome. I will definitely be back. They have Great happy hour as well for beers and wine which are, from what I believe, 50% off. One time, for two people we only paid about $35 for everything and it was like we had eaten all you can eat sushi. The staff there is very friendly and everything is clean.

We were initially frustrated because we were under quoted the wait time and ended up waiting a little over an hour when we kept getting told 25-30 mins. Thankfully we were able to get some drinks from the bar. The bartender was super friendly and gave us great service! The lychee saketinis my girlfriend and I got were just ok, nothing too special. After we got seated we were offered complimentary appetizers for the miscommunication with the wait times which was very kind of them! I love the concept of the restaurant but as a vegetarian there were very limited options! I ordered the jalepeno cream cheese popper and asked before ordering if it had meat in it I was told no but it had crab in it. All I was able to try were basic avocado rolls, seaweed salad, edamame, and vegetable tempura. I would love to see more vegetarian options! If more veg options were offered I will consider coming back! Just not worth the price in my opinion!",

I did enjoy the crab sushi, plain so you could actually taste the crab, which was good--and it wasn't Krab. I'd prefer a California Roll with a piece of crab instead of the smooshed up mixture found here and elsewhere. The cooked scallops were great, because they weren't overcooked; some might call them undercooked, but I don't. I wouldn't order two plates of tempura again; one is all I can handle, for sure, before the fat drags me down. I wouldn't go that far just for the sushi, but I would take kids there. I love that there are pix of everything to help you decide what to get, along with a list of the ingredients so my friend could avoid avocado (which she is allergic to).",

    "text": "Exceeded our Expectations!  Sapporo is a unique dining experience which included a revolving sushi conveyor belt, robotic \"servers\" which is a mini robot car (looks like roomba) that delivers your special orders to your table, and an iPad ordering system. Very space age.   Shout out to Chris our great bartender! The Sapporo Sour was the best drink ever! Order 3! You can sit st the bar while you wait since they don't take reservations. The wait shouldn't be longer than 20 minutes.   The revolving selection changed throughout the dining experience but I would estimate about 15 options every 5 minutes, with the most popular rotating often. Each plate is labeled so you know what your picking up.   All the plates are covered for health safety reasons, as the germaphobe in me was worried if everyone in the restaurant would get the flu from the line. Definitely not something to worry about. Clean and safe!   All revolving plates are $2.50. You get to stack them up while you eat and they count them at the end to tally your bill.   They do have many a la carte options all under $12. If you don't see the option your looking for on the conveyor, you can have it sent to your table via the robot server in under a minute, for the same $2.50 price.   It was such a dining experience! Stacking the plates was actually fun because you get to assess and compare \"the damage\" with your friends or against the tables sitting around you.",

Service was actually pretty decent and fast for dinner time at night I was very happily impressed with the staff very quick to sit me I got paid in out about half an hour everything was done. only downfall is if you want item that does not have a certain food products a avocado or tomato you have to tell a manager or your waitress if not it just comes out as standard shown in the picture on the menu which you cannot zoom into but it does tell you but it just does not give you the option to edit the roles that is only thing I do not like",

Before you start grabbing a bunch of plates, I would check the price difference between the menu and the plates that are already out. Some sushi come in 1, 2 or 4. For the sushi roll and gyoza it's actually cheaper to order from the menu if you're going to eat all of it. This place is also good if you're not going to eat so much. The taste of their sushi is pretty much the same as every where we go. I really like their shrimp tacos! My husband and I would go back to this place if we're craving good sushi and if we're in town.",

Food - of course you cannot compare revolving sushi quality to high-end omakase.  But for $2.50 you can get otoro, bluefin tuna, and uni, I would highly recommend ordering these! The quality is better than your average AYCE on these items.  However, if you were to eat your heart out as if you were at an AYCE like I did, if could get pricey.  My bill was $85 for two ppl. (I did most of the ordering and eating :/)  The toro is a hit or miss.  I've gotten the perfect ones, but I've also gotten the ones with tendon :(  Salmon sashimi with orange.  It's refreshing but be sure to order it with light sauce so it's not drowning in ponzu.  Tuna tartar - the first time I ordered it, it was drowning in ponzu so I returned it.  I gave it a second try during my second visit and asked for light sauce, turns out the heavy ponzu was probably used to mask the fishy taste.  Will not order this item again.   Service - I've been here 3 times and you can tell they really got the whole service thing down!  Great experience every time!  I think kids would really enjoy the bullet train delivery.  I recommend ordering food little by little so the train will come more often.",

The quality isn't like your top places in town for sure, but for $2.50 a plate, this tapas style offering is perfect.  We got out of there with 4 drinks for $60 after getting quite full on sushi, ramen, and gyoza.  Standouts were the yellowtail taco and sushi roe.  Gyoza were solid but a little cold; that's a hazard with the conveyor belt system.  Every dish was eaten in full and nothing went to waste.  The only thing they're missing is a late night happy hour. Sapporo is a fun alternative to a traditional sit-down sushi restaurant and good for kids or late night eats.",

Similar to restaurants I have been to in both Hawaii and Japan, Sapporo had a ton of various dishes and other offerings. The fun part was watching my friend experience revolving sushi for the first time and hoping she didn't drop everything coming off of the belt. The food was delicious. I tried everything from toro to raw oysters. The only downside is that it all adds up very quickly. For our party of three, the bill came out to $99 (not including gratuity). Which compared to the all-you-can-eat options in the area it was a bit more expensive than most. However, the atmosphere was pleasant and the experience was fun. I would consider coming back but most likely only for a special occasion as other sushi restaurants would be a lot more wallet-friendly.",

It's the first revolving sushi that I know of and will most likely start the trend. I've obviously heard of revolving sushi but never participated .  It was closed at 3:xx when we passed but opened back up for dinner at 5:00 . We arrived at 5:15 on a Sunday and there were already more than a few tables full . The parking was tough to decipher with various signs looking reserved for certain stores. When we approached the door there was a sign that said \"park anywhere . \" We now know and will just find a spot .   The food !!  The sushi was very good . Compared to the ayce' in the area the quality is above that of those places . The rice was seasoned well and the fish portions were Above average . We ordered the branzino which was very fluffy and seasoned great . The toro is very buttery . The sushi rolls that come on the conveyor were mostly 3-4 pieces and are perfect for trying a few of the rolls especially for 2.50 a plate . I would skip the tuna tartare next time , although the sauce complimented the fish well it was missing a certain crunch . The oysters were tasty a well.  The nigiri Conveyor selections came by pretty often and there was a medium selection of fish to choose from . I will definitely try the ribeye  next time it looked great .   Overall a great new restaurant . Very clean and simple on the inside . It's going to be a very busy spot I'd imagine because of the conveyors newness in town .  We ate quite a bit for 2 of us and the price was pretty in line with the AYCE in the area .",

The restaurant was pretty much full when we walked in but we were still seated with no wait- which was awesome and really exemplifies a well run business. Also, the restaurant was very clean and had nice modern decor.   As soon as we were seated a server came to our table and explained how everything worked; essentially the \"concept\" of the conveyor belt of sushi. Each dish is 2.99 and there is also a tablet at each table where you can order full size rolls or other menu items that are not on the conveyor. At the end, the server just counts the number of plates you picked up and totals it with any additional full size rolls and/ or menu items you may have ordered off the tablet.   The sushi itself was pretty good but the number of plates available on the conveyor was lacking- it seemed like they weren't refilling it as quickly as tables were picking them up. We sat waiting multiple rounds as the conveyor went around with barely any plates on it. Also, there wasn't much of a variety of full size rolls you could order off of the tablet either.   On another note, when you do order full size rolls they are rolled out on an electric cart above the conveyor directly to your table which was pretty awesome!",

After counting all of our piled plates I think my cousin and I ate at least 11 plates of food each, the plates are tiny so it's not too crazy but I don't think I've ever eaten that much sushi at any other place. It is that tasty.",

    "text": "The wife and I are big fans of \"track sushi\" in general and used to go out for it frequently when we were living in the NW; apparently, this style of sushi restaurant is relatively new to the area, as Sapporo Revolving Sushi was one of only two or three listings in the entire city. We decided on SRS because it was close to our home and also because it was newly opened and we like to support local businesses, being local business owners ourselves :)  We arrived about 10 minutes before their 5pm opening and were able to find parking right away, even though the lot is one of several on Spring Mt. that are quite small and obviously not intended for its current use/tenants.  Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by warm and friendly staff who, after a brief exchange between the two servers about who was assigned where this evening that actually served to make us feel more comfortable (laugh), seated us in a small booth, left of the right-most aisle.  Our server took our drink orders, after informing us that the night's special included all 3 imported beers on their beverage menu for a reduced price of $1.95 per draft ( a deal that both the wife and I took advantage of!), left, and shortly returned with our beers, leaving us to peruse the menu and eyeball the delicious items passing us on the conveyor belt next to our table.   The menu itself is an \"Ipad-style\" touchscreen which features all of the selections at SRS and even allows diners to review the individual ingredients before ordering, to ensure that they know and like what they will get.  While I played with the shiny gadget, my wife pulled a few items from the sushi track. (We had been informed, while chatting w/ our server, that all the track dishes were priced at $2.50 per plate and had sensors timing them to a freshness of 30 min. or less).   We finally found a few items we would like to try on the touchscreen menu and placed our order for a few half-rolls ($3.50 ea.). We were surprised to find out that orders placed on the pad arrive via a motorized cart (that we had not even noticed up until it arrived, flashing and beeping at our shoulders, lol), which rides along a dedicated rail that is installed at eye-level on top of the sushi track.   Grab your order, press a button to send the little robot back down the track to its next order, and enjoy!  The food itself was wonderful and all of the items I sampled were delightfully fresh and flavorful. The staff were friendly and helpful, gladly explaining how to order when asked, and the owners themselves were even in attendance, going table to table greeting guests and showing off neat menu features and items (try the \"mexican roll\" if you're a fan of spicy crab!)  We will be making SRS a weekly night out from this point on and highly suggest you do the same ;)  Five stars.",

    "text": "My sister has been waiting for a place like this so we came for dinner after the movies, around 8pm. The place was very clean, very spacious, with modern decorations, overall a nice and comfortable environment.   Our server Ann Marie was very sweet, attentive, explained the menu and their system to us very well. Food was also pretty good, fish were fresh, rolls were decent, they don't have a big appetizer menu but what they do have were very good.   Now the cons: - Their \"Popcorn Lobster Roll\" - the description said \"deep fried lobster...\", they did not use lobster meat they used crawfish. First off the fake lobster came out cold and soggy, not crispy. My sister was the first to notice that it was not lobster meat because it did not look like chunk of lobster meat but looked like a whole crawfish. I then peeled the batter off and saw that it was indeed a crawfish. I included a picture. False advertisement!! - We were seated in the far right \"lane,\" as soon as we sat down I saw that at the end of the other two lanes there were cooks working constantly putting plates on the revolver, there were no one at the end of our lane working. As such, we picked up a few that we wanted then sat there waiting for more to come, our lane had 6 tables with no new plates coming out while the lane next to us had 3 tables and their lane was filled with plates. We ended up ordering from the iPad, which to me defeats the purpose of coming to a revolving sushi place. The head chef needs to keep an eye on the floor and make sure they assign cooks where necessary.  - My sister and I ordered an udon and a ramen to end our meal, mine came out while hers did not. After a little while we asked about her ramen and our server told us that they had made the ramen but lost the ticket so the ramen was sitting in the window. The ramen was cold so we asked them to heat it up for us, the waitress brought it back to the kitchen saying \"They want it hot\" - and I saw the cook annoyingly say something to the waitress and shook her head, she then saw me looking at her and stopped. If you have an open kitchen please advice your staff about making faces and complaining in front of the guests.  Overall, I have no issue with the quality of the fish or most of the dishes. We ordered a few items from the iPad and they were very good. But for a first impression this place fell short, from the lack of plates on the revolver to the mishaps (telling us we ordered more than we did because they got multiple tickets, the ramen not coming out) and the False advertisement it was not a great experience. For me personally I chose to come here and was willing to pay more for it so I had higher expectations. I think they are still new and still have some kinks to work out.",

It's service with a really smooth and sweet carrot puree. Ordered ramen but I wasn't all that intruiged. Noodles were a little hard and not very much meat. Broth was good though.",

    "text": "Thank you for bringing revolving sushi to Vegas. We had to wait quite a while to get a seat, the place is a hot item right now.  $2.50 a plate of the conveyor  There is a menu you can order from off the ipad mounted on the inside of the booth, when it is not rebooting that is. When you order something on the ipad don't forget to send it, we had selected some things and they just sit there until you confirm. Black garlic ramen was very flavorful Special sushi order come out on a separate track on top of the conveyor and you get excited even when you haven't ordered anything :D The softshell crab is so delicious. We ordered a lot off the menu, not the belt.  We were seated on the right side, which has its own conveyor, so less variety and stuff hangs out a lot longer. Somebody said that it gets kicked off after 30 minutes, I can tell you it doesn't, there was a bunch of sad looking items that just kept going round and round for the whole time we were there.  The sushi tasted clean and you can order a whole roll when you don't see what you are waiting for running around.  The bill caused me to have some chest pains.  The nigiri on the conveyor is an extremely thin slice of fish on rice. the two pieces you get might equate to one piece at a regular sushi place and then it would still be small.  You get a varied number of slices of rolls per plate depending on what you pick. These were also really small, AYCE sized, not I ordered a roll at a sit down sushi place sized.  So..  decor, nothing really. price, seems inexpensive but it is not for the portion size. service, ordered items show up pretty quickly, fun to get the little tram to deliver you some food. taste, fresh tasting sushi, flavorful ramen",

So unless your there at a busy time they don't put the good stuff on the belt. You have to order full rolls. I like the plate idea 2.50 per plate with one to four rolls on each depending on what it is. Also depending on what you order a robot like tray brings your food out or the server. They have desert but I feel they need mochi. I only gave four stars because during the day they aren't busy so you don't get as many specialty rolls to try and it's boring stuff on the belt. Try the popcorn lobster it's delicious.",

My husband and I have been to many sushi restaurants so our expectations were very high and boy did this place deliver!!! Amazing!!  Ahi was very fresh and the quality was very good. I'll say it would contend with some of the best in Hawaii. Prices are super affordable, each plate on the conveyor belt are $2.50. They have daily Happy Hours that start at 10pm-closing, where ALL plates are $1.50 and japanese draft beers are half off.  They also have a menu where you could order rolls and other dishes, which range from $4-$9.   The fact that they have lids on their plates and they have sensors beneath it, so after 30 minutes they're removed from the conveyor belt..is absolutely genius. You never have to worry if dishes were sitting out too long.   Great ambiance and very friendly staff. Definitely a place we'll come back to everytime we're in Vegas!!! Mahalo Sapporo!",

However, knowing who our server is was a little confusing due to the fact no one really introduced themselves. We had five different people serve us. All the plates on the conveyer belt were 2.50 each which in my opinion a little expensive. Each plate had about two sushi each. They had other special items that were pretty good. Overall it was a great experience, I'll probably go again :)",

We were offered a menu to order from, but what fun is it to order from the menu when you are at a sushi conveyor restaurant?",

When we sat down the server explained how it all worked. We went during happy hour too, so the prices were great! There were a ton of items on the revolving belt to choose from, and new items would randomly pop up. The have an Ipad menu of things you can order from the kitchen. We didn't try those this time, but from the great experience we had, we will for sure be back to try them. The ramen and udon bowls were very well priced. I look forward to making this a weekly spot for sure!",

Located in Chinatown, Sapporro sushi is central for most parts of the valley. Upson walking up they are well lit with a huge neon sign advertising their spot.   Inside is a smaller lobby that opens into the dining and bar area. On a side note, the architecture art wall is so cool to stop and look at. Solid wood octagons are hand carved and manipulated to give a 3D effect.   Once seated you have two options for getting sushi. 1.) Using the iPad at your table to order special rolls, apatizers or kitchen selections. Or 2.) The best way, grab sushi as it come around on the conveyer belt! Handmade fresh sushi rolls and nigiri are plated and sent around the restraint in covered plates. Each white plate is only $2.50.   The food is phenomenal, savory and wide selected. The service is spot on, we were checked on by all the servers in our section. No one is left unattended. At the end they add up your white plates and multiply that by $2.50. Easy!!",

My family and I dined here on Thursday - seated at 12:30pm, and left the restaurant at 1:33pm. Great turnaround time! Our server was beyond graceful, and incredibly courteous. She seated us, offered high chairs for my toddler, and even brought trainers for my kids' chopsticks (such a nice touch). Then came her quick tutorial on conveyor belt 101 and how-to. She was so attentive, and checked on us with just the right amount of distance so we can enjoy our time. The electronic menu and ordering system is superb, and I can't wait to dine here again!",

    "text": "Las Vegas has a surprisingly large amount of sushi restaurants, for a city no where near the ocean, they serve some of freshest fish, Sapporo Revolving Sushi is no exception.   One of our favorites in Hawaii back in the day was very much like this place, a moving conveyor belt of freshly made sushi moving past your table. You picked what you wanted and price was based on the color of the plate. Sapporo differs slightly, all plates off the belt are $2.50, but the smartly added bonus, a computer pad at the table, allowing you to order everything from specific sushi rolls, ramen, tempura, to dessert.   One thing to note, when you order, a small robotic tray comes on top of the conveyor belt to deliver your order, it stops in front of your table announcing that your order is being delivered. Our first time, had no idea and took the plate only to discover it wasn't ours. The robotic delivery tray will flash yellow and announce your order, it's a little confusing the first time.   All the sushi was fresh and very good, new favorite for me will be the pepper ahi!",

Some of the other pieces that I had were enjoyable if not particularly remarkable, including the tobiko and the sweet shrimp.  The so-so: the sea urchin was not particularly good. I passed up some salmon items because some of the salmon did not look to be of a good quality--clearly farm raised fish.  This is better than the revolving sushi place I went to in Atlanta, but I would still say that it is still a place better enjoyed with a group more interested in a fun experience than particularly high quality sushi.",

Now don't expect super high quality fish. C'mon it's only $2.50 per dish so you get what you pay for. But, if you want a dish freshly made or don't see it on the belt you have the option to order it on the ipad. It will then be shortly delivered to your table by a robot. You'll know it's yours because it will stop in front of you and will blink yellow. There are many other dishes on the ipad so be sure to peruse all items. A few dishes that tickled my palate were the yellowtail & tuna tacos, peppered tuna sushi, & the steak. As for the space, it's chic, modern, and spacious serviced by friendly waiters. Btw, there's a call button on the ipad if you need to holler at one.",

Happy hour here is pretty late night, 10pm Sunday-Thursday and 11pm Fri/Saturday until close, but at $1.50 a plate is the perfect late night snack that isn't terrible for you. While it only applies to the conveyor belt items, that's good enough. Beer and other options are really cheap too, making it hard not to order at least one.  When we first went here near opening day, they were having trouble keeping up but now they generally keep the belts well stocked. That's obviously a big deal since sometimes you can be waiting a while for what you want to come around. Of course you can order from the kitchen, but that isn't included in the Happy Hour.  I'd say the fish is better than average quality. Compared to AYCE, it's certainly better than those options.  Service is generally prompt. Most of the time, you don't need one since this is a conveyor belt and delivery robot restaurant!",

I heard about Sapporo Revolving Sushi through the grapevine and almost had a chance to try a soft opening, but that fell through. Fortunately, after mentioning this restaurant to a friend, he suggested that we try it out this weekend. We showed up at about 5:45 on Friday night and only had to wait upwards of 10 minutes for a seat, which was fantastic in light of the crowd that had materialized by meal's end.  The server strangely asked whether we'd eaten at a revolving sushi restaurant before, and my friend said yes (although I hadn't), which ended up in us skipping the tutorial. That kinda added a wait for me as I naively blundered my way through the tablet-based ordering system (note: press the \"i\" with a circle around it for hi-res photos of a food item) until my friend's gf pointed out that I had to press \"Place Order\" to send my list to the kitchen, so let me help out other newbies and say this: don't forget to press \"Place Order\" when you're sure of what you want to order.  That said, the tablet orders took about 2-3 minutes to come out, which is insanely fast for any restaurant anywhere. Most of them arrived on the top \"rail\" of the conveyor belt system, via a machine that travels to the appropriate spot, lights up to signal the correct table, and plays prerecorded messages prompting you to grab your order then press the button to return the bot to the kitchen. Occasionally, a server would bring out your order. Not much interaction with employees aside from that, ordering drinks, removing lids, and finalizing checks.  Oh, that's right, lids. So the potentially faster way to get food is by grabbing it off the lower level of the conveyor belt, which constantly runs clockwise with signs naming foods followed by a small number of plates containing said foods. Small appetizers, nigiri, and half-rolls all makes appearances, and each plate is $2.50 (tallied up by hand-counting plates at meal's end). No different colored plates or anything in this restaurant's belt system.  Now, when I said potentially faster, I mean that some items weren't always available, such as various \"taco\" appetizers, premium nigiri (1 piece per order, not 2 pieces), and hand rolls (don't know that they even a belt item despite pricing). Fortunately, you can order everything for delivery via tablet, so use/abuse that as needed.  I think I've waxed poetic on the concept enough. I can and should probably say a lot about the food too, and I usually talk about each individual type of fish, but I can summarize it this time by noting that every single piece of seafood which I tasted was fresh. I'm talking about upwards of over 20 bites, with over 10 different varieties. Nothing was absolutely the best quality you can find in town, but almost everything at least matches if not exceeds expectations for \"entry-level\" sushi.  Highlights for me included the toro ($2.50/1 pc), orange salmon ($7.95 for a more affordable yet surprisingly comparable version of \"sake orenji\"), mackerel ($2.50/2 pc), and Branzino with Carrot Puree ($4.95, not too huge but moist and tender w/ crispy skin; caution that puree may be too sweet for some).  Assuming that they can maintain that consistent quality, Sapporo Revolving Sushi offers a very solid balance between value and price. I just found myself wanting more in the value department after seeing my final check. I wasn't starving, but I was quite hungry, so the sizing of the nigiri reminded me of all-you-can-eat sushi experiences all over town, which would have cost less for a potentially gluttonous feast with relatively marginal decreases in quality. I'll probably save future trips here for when I'm craving particular foods and/or only moderately hungry.",

Me and a friend came in around 2pm supposedly they close at 3pm for a few hours which is a little strange lol specially when people are still walking in at 2:50.... there was a little wait since one of the revolving machines wasn't working but wasn't long    I ordered a mule it was yummy and very refreshing   Sushi on the belt are 2.50$ which is a great price but there is also a tablet to order other items as well which are a little higher but it's definitely not expensive at all  I ordered the toro oysters orange salmon I have definitely had better toro but for 2.50 I can't complain about the price the orange salmon was yummy it was 7.50$ the oysters were yummy and fresh .... my friend got stuff which they seemed to enjoy I didn't try any of there's   The bills for two of us was maybe 50$ it was definitely worth the price plus the experience was great  I would say check this place out I will be coming back",

    "text": "Came here on the first night of their invite only \"soft opening\" after the manager surprisingly invited me and my guests for a gastronomic experience. Freddy, the manager of this very first revolving sushi restaurant in Vegas, gave us a warm welcome upon our arrival. Walking inside the entrance, we were seated at a booth right next to the open kitchen areas where the executive chef and sushi chefs did their magic.   The conveyer belts of sushi are split in the middle of each booth. It's really appetizing to see each belt filled up with actual sushi and no empty plates or huge gaps in between. On a cleanliness level, so far so good! Plus the concept of a sushi-go-round restaurant is always entertaining while grubbing on your favorite roll of sushi or nigiri. You are also able to place special orders (nigiri, special rolls, appetizers, side dishes, gourmet orders, desserts) via tablet, in which each dish speeds towards your table atop the conveyor belt like a Roomba but instead of cleaning, it serves you food!    Several servers would always stop by to take our trays and larger gourmet plates so that it wouldn't stack the table space. Our main server, Jeremy, was very attentive and provided us with outstanding hospitality. He definitely made sure that nothing was amiss and our glasses would always be filled. Since it was their first day and management is still working out the kinks, even when the conveyor belt system had an internet slowdown, Jeremy was able to make sure we had our orders readily by jotting them down specifically on a notepad until the system came back online.   To start with, the cocktails we ordered are: sapporo sour (matcha on light alcohol without so much of the bitterness), tokyo summer (definitely my fave as there is yuzu flavor and hints of citrusy elderflower in it), peach saketini (this is pretty strong in the alcohol department, i would go for this only if i'm ready to paint the town red), and lychee margarita (also somewhat strong, but it creeps up on you later on).  They have $2.50 TORO!! Super, duper fresh. Didn't even need much soy sauce to soak most of the nigiris and rolls in and they were plenty tasteful. I also do believe that they have salmon belly nigiri. It was juicy and satisfying with every bite, and strangely filling. I didn't have to over order this one at all.The sushi appetizer, orange salmon, is extremely similar to a local restaurant's sake orenji (but without the yuzu tobiko and thinly mini jalapeno slices) which is a huge plus in my book. It's also affordable so at any possibility, I would come by every week just for this dish as it's my favorite out of the rest! Fresh and juicy but not an overdose of yuzu! It was just right, especially with the portions to share among 4 people.   Gourmet dishes that we ordered but not limited to: ribeye (medium rare; juicy and of decent portion), pork belly (warm in cute cube form, also juicy), black cod (light and buttery soft), and shrimp (loved that they deshelled the center to make it easier for customers to eat - it means that the chefs put careful consideration on how they prepare their meals for us). I feel that each surprisingly nicely presented dish had an array of flavor however I would like to see a slight improvement on the black cod because it's so mushy.   Because their solid desserts weren't available at the time, we opted to try each of their ice cream flavors: vanilla, pineapple, pistachio, and green tea. The vanilla was surprisingly not lusterless or plain at all, very creamy in texture, and when you mix it with the pineapple its like eating dole whip! The pineapple honestly reminded me of a yuzu sorbet-- citrusy and I would love to order this in between sushi dishes to clean my palate. Pistachio was definitely nutty but did not overpower my tastebuds at all. Green tea didn't have a bitter aftertaste at all so it was easy to eat with every scoop.   Ultimately, I would definitely come back here again for their salmon belly nigiri, orange salmon, and the rest of their dessert selections when it becomes available!",

    "text": "Fresh. To. Death.   I've been eating sushi all my life, which unfortunately means that I'm picky as hell when it comes to my fish. I first experienced kaiten zushi, or conveyor belt sushi, when I was studying abroad in Japan ten years ago, and had always been a fan. I mean, it's really a millennial's dream - the instant gratification of grabbing food and immediately being able to eat it, the inexpensive price, and wide selection of choices.   My friends and I beat the dinner crowd by arriving around 5:45pm on a weekday, and boy were we glad. We were seated fairly quickly but when we left an hour or so later, the place was swarming for a weekday.   Top three rolls to try (all available on the conveyor belt):  1. Mexican Roll (spicy crab and shrimp, topped with avocado, sriracha, and a white/sweet sauce) 2. Popcorn Lobster Roll (deep fried lobster chunks on top of a California roll with yum yum sauce, eel sauce, and chipotle mayo) 3. Sexy Mama (spicy scallop and avocado roll topped with salmon)  Each plate is $2.50, and each person ended up spending around $30. There's a tablet at each table where you can order an item (if it's not available on the conveyor belt) and it's delivered to you either by a little train over the conveyor belt or by the waiter/waitress. I ordered a piece of uni that was priced at $2.50 for a single piece. I got a scoop of ice cream and they were all around $3 per serving. It's very comparable to AYCE joints, as others have pointed out, but I do feel like the experience is more fun/engaging than AYCE.   Bonus points for having a great ambiance (not too loud, tables weren't too crowded/close to each other) and great service. I can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Las Vegas finally has a revolving sushi spot of its own!  Granted the quality you get at any revolving spot is usually mediocre at best, but that's where Sapporo stands out from the rest. The quality for all the fish was excellent, extremely fresh, and priced decently at only 2.50 per white revolving plate.  Their ordering system works good as well and is very user friendly and easy to figure out; allowing you the options to order, remove orders, pictures, and even an info section that informs you of what is included in certain specialty rolls.  I'm not particularly a big sushi roll eater because most places seem to over sauce their concoctions but at Sapporo they figured out how to perfect the amount of sushi to yum yum/eel sauce ratio. Trust me on this one, nothing is worse than an overly sauced drowned out roll.  You can also order items from the kitchen that comes out via a plate on a track that comes presented to your table side. Items on this menu can range anywhere from 6-10+ dollars. My favorite from this section was the orange salmon. It's almost identical to a similar favorite dish of mine at another restaurant here in Vegas but cheaper ($7). It's citrusy, fresh, and spot on so good it'll make you wanna \"slap yo mama.\"  The experience is both fun and entertaining to order and allows you to get just the right amount of food you want without over eating. The only dish I don't think I was over fond of was the baked cod and soft shell crab. The crab was a little salty while the presentation was beautifully done, and for the baked cod it came out in this sort of mushy texture which was sort of strange despite the flavor still being pretty good.  Aside from these minor details though, the over all experience was amazing and I would definitely come back to try their scallops, ramen, or just stop by for some fresh sushi.  Staff were both informative and polite upon the moment we entered to the second we left, and the owner (Freddy) was extremely kind to our party and generous to us. We definitely plan to come back again in the near future for some more!",

Learned a lot from just talking to him both visits, like why Vegas hadn't had a revolving sushi yet and some info about their conveyor belts and how it all works. He gave us a nice little tour around the restaurant the first night to explain how everything works. Very passionate about this industry and all of his restaurants.   Food is delish, and even the single dessert that they had available. Can't wait for them to add more flavors for it, like strawberry. There was different looking toro first and second visit for me so one of the chefs explained how they're actually 2 different kinds of toro and so we will probably request that next time :)  Overall I love the vibe and the atmosphere. Everyone is super friendly and nice, and they are pretty attentive to your needs. I will be back many times over and look forward to their infinite amount of new ideas to be implemented.",

They have an iPad at every table so you can place orders of items that don't pass you on the conveyor belt.   You can also hail your server through it as well.   Although this wasn't really necessary for us because the server and the bussers were always around and checking on us.   We weren't that hungry so all we just got a few rolls and nigiri but I'm actually quite excited to come back and try some of their hot items appetizers.

Most revolving sushi bars I've been to have a way of identifying the pricing tiers of their plates, but Sapporo made it simple, and just reduces the quantity on the plates for more expensive rolls. It's a really well-designed experience.   And the sushi itself - so good! I do wish there were more vegetarian options, but you can't have everything you'd like everywhere you go. They even have ramen under $5 a bowl, and most of their apps and full rolls are very affordable too.   We came during the late night happy hour times where everything is just $1.75 each. There were 6 parties ahead of us but we didn't have to wait long once 11pm hit. They had already planned for the happy hour rush.",

I mean it is only $2.50 but at least make it a bit bigger for portion wise.   And their options are pretty limited for the nigiri. But their rolls are pretty good. We got the caterpillar and rainbow roll. That cost like $7. It was pretty worth the price.   Their service was okay too.   Totally give this place a shot if you're around the area.",

The portions that are on the revolver are absolutely perfect in leu of any AYCE price. Each plate from the revolver was just 2.50 - we went so fast I didn't even take any pictures. And most of the plates have 3-4 pieces so you don't fill up on one roll so fast. I really enjoyed the variety of rolls on the revolver though. They had everything from inari, yellowtail and basic Cali and Philly rolls. Although we did order the for the halibut roll from the menu and ramen, we we're absolutely stuffed from 8 plates. I don't think I will ever be as happy at another sushi spot in town from now on.(Sorry Hiroba)",

I really like this location because it's a bit newer and the service is great. I haven't had any issues with our services the past couple visits.  The most recent visit, in particular, wasn't the best. For some reason, I thought they would have a wide variety of rolls to choose from, but they didn't. For the past couple times, we have been going to AYCE sushi, and they have SO MANY specialty rolls that I expected Sapporo would have the same thing! I guess it's been I minute since I've been here. The most special they got with their rolls here was what looked like torched Kraft American Cheese on a Salmon Nigiri. LOL  To put things into perspective, we pretty much had one of everything and it nearly came out the same as if you were to pay $30 a head for AYCE sushi.   I would come here again if they had eel sauce on their dragon rolls. (Yes, for some reason, they didn't the night we visited.)",

Pretty much all rolls with tempura were cold and the avocado would be out so long that it was starting to oxidize. Two specialty rolls kept going around and around with nobody touching them; might be time to get those off the \"belt\" and put out something different. I also wasn't a fan of how many of the rolls had cream cheese. The rolls I did sample were decent. The \"sexy mama\" was my favorite and the garlic tuna was an unexpected gem. The garlic edamame were the superstars! Slightly spicy, savory, and balanced but present garlic.   In all fairness, if I had ordered a full roll with hot elements, I'd hope it would come out nice and fresh, but I think that's more suited for larger groups. As a twosome, the sampling plates made more sense to try a variety of options. The experience is a lot of fun and it's definitely more my style than \"traditional AYCE\"; I would definitely go back and make a point to try a full roll (mainly because I want the futuristic tray server to come to my table!)",

I have been to revolving sushi places like this for quite some time but in other cities and countries, so when Sapporo opened in Vegas I was grateful.  Yes it is fun as different sushi and sashimi's go by and you can take what you want. One thing that I have liked about this concept is if you are hungry you can eat right away, just reach over and grab a plate. Also this is great if you just want a couple bite and do not want to order a full roll.  There are other items that you can order from a touch screen at your table. Some of the items come to you by a little trolley with flashing lights or the server comes and delivers it. Like the ramen or udon, you do not want that coming your way on the motorized trolley!  The prices are good too and are one price for the conveyer belt sushi. I have been to ones that are priced differently depending on the plate colors. You pretty much know what you are paying for!  This is a fun and nice option for sushi in Vegas and the prices are great for any budget!",

The variety of sushi rolls, fish, soups, tempura & even desserts is way better than some places in CA and Hawaii! And the coolest high tech part about this place is that you order off of an iPad and your order comes out on an individual device-thing that travels above the normal conveyor belt and stops right where your booth is! In addition, there are also signs on the conveyor belt that lets you know what you're about to pick up which is really helpful.",

It's definitely not AYCE but the prices aren't that bad either. It's the concept that makes it.   It's a beautiful restaurant with wide booths that can't fit quite a large party. There's 2 rotary sides on each restaurant, that circle through the kitchen. And also they have a little train that delivers food to your table above the rotary, when you order from the iPad on the table.   They do have happy hour which is awesome, sushi included!   The sushi is fresh and since it was busy today I wasn't hesitant to grab what was on the rotary.   Service was good. I mean, it's technically self serve but they come by to refill your water and check on you.   For the first time today I tried their soft shell which was delicious! It had a squash paste sauce beneath it that just topped it off!  I also tried their I love yellowtail roll which was beautifully presented but tasted just as good!   Their desserts are good as well.   I definitely enjoy coming to this place without being rushed on an AYCE type of deal and where I can actually breathe after eating a good amount of sushi!",

It's $2.50 a plate off the conveyor belt and they have an iPad system that allows you to order anything off the belt, and each is priced accordingly.  I ordered the black garlic ramen, shishito peppers, garlic tuna, king salmon, unagi nigiri and tuna tacos.  I loved the shishito peppers! I don't know what kind of sauce they put on these grilled peppers, but the sauce they drizzle on top paired with the bonito flakes complements the dish completely. The nigiri had a great fish to rice ratio. Nice balance of rice and fish, and the fish was cold and thickly sliced, but not overwhelming. Now for the ramen, not the best tonkotsu broth, but it was still very good for a sushi restaurant and I would definitely order it again. The tuna tacos were pretty good too. I just wish that I wasn't too full to be able to eat the other salmon and yellowtail tacos too! But I shall save that for my next visit.  Don't be afraid of the sushi Roomba and give this place a try and take a step in the conveyor belt sushi culture!",

This is where you can order a variety of cooked food like appetizers, ramen, dessert, and other sushi not on the conveyor belt.  I loved the black garlic ramen. Full of flavor. Smaller than a regular bowl of ramen, but good sized and only about $4ish.  Appetizers were good, we tried shishito peppers, jalapeno bomb, tuna tacos, salmon tacos.

There are revolving sushi and you also have a choice to order from the computer menu which will come out to you above all the revolving sushi it's pretty cool! I recommend it even just going for experience. Nigiri was delicious! I believe there is an option for all you can eat but we didn't choose that! Would definitely come back!  Ordered two rolls from the computer, spider roll (delicious) and I forgot the other roll! But I love the halibut  nigiri and Japanese mackerel nigiri! (Writing this makes me crave it!)",

All plates on the conveyor belt was $2.50  and anything we ordered from the table monitor got to us quickly using a robotic waiter.    We tried over 30+ plates and I had the udon noodle soup to top it off.  Glad I did.    Highly recommended and will be back. This was a great experience for all of us and there are plenty of other plates I still want to try.  Good job Sapporo!",

They have toro=fatty tuna, uni=sea urchin, salmon roe=ikura and mackerel=Saba. They are my favorites and I usually judge if they are good, they are good Restaurant and I will come back again.

    "text": "I came here for the first time on a Thursday night with my boyfriend. We usually go to AYCE sushi spots but I've heard of some hype on this spot from friends so I decided to give it a try. We got sat immediately (it was not busy at and was greeted right away by a female server. She asked us what we wanted to drink and failed to ask if we were first timers..there were no explanation on how this revolving sushi/ conveyor works, or how the iPad screen worked, etc. I understand that \"resolving sushi\" is self explanatory..it's like the old school sushi boats. However, it would've been nice to know that you can order different items on the iPad at the table..OR if there were any off menu specials..OR that happy hour is at 10pm(literally we had no idea they have a HH--not that we cared).. but sadly no info was provided until we asked our server. She apologized and briefly explained that each plate was $2.50 and that if we ordered from the iPad, the food will from the kitchen.  We started grabbing sushi off the belt and got a few of our usual favorite nigiri: salmon belly, hamachi, trout, & super white tuna. Everything seemed to be good until i got to the hamachi. The hamachi nigiri was warm and extremely fishy smelling and tasting. I set the plate aside and washed the taste out with my drink and continued eating the other fish. After not seeing anything we wanted on the conveyor belt, we decided to order some things from the iPad. We ordered the pork belly, ramen, uni, and black tobiko nigiri. When our server came around to clean the table behind us, i told her about the foul hamachi that i experienced. She apologized and removed it from our table.   The pork belly the arrived next. My boyfriend tried a piece and said it was alright..not quite tender but it was flavorful. As i reach for a piece, i noticed a strand of hair short curly on the plate. I immediately asked for our server and told her about the strand of hair. She apologized and took the dish away, never to return again (literally never came back to check on us, a guy later stopped by to check on us and gave us our check.) the Ramen was plain and basic.. broth was below average. The uni was sad, there was literally one baby piece on the rice. I was happy to pay for it at regular/market price so I'm not sure if they did that for HH. The black tobiko was all very pathetic.. with just enough eggs to cover the rice.. it's kind of funny now that i picture how it looked when it came out.   The cherry on top of my experience at this restaurant is that not a single person/manager besides the female server (that disappeared later on) came by to apologize about the fishy hamachi or the questionable thick curly hair on the pork belly or offer a brand new dish.. instead they just took the items off our tab and called it a day. I think the best word to describe everything about this restaurant is disappointing. The hype was non existent. The service was disappointing. The food was mediocre. I would not recommend this place to anyone... there are plenty of sushi places, AYCE and al la cattle spots that will have better service and quality than this place. Save yourself from disappointment!",

Joshua greeted us warmly and told us it was only his 4th day, but we were impressed with his attentiveness and knowledge. He quickly walked us through the use of the tablet to order items not on the conveyor belt. My son enjoyed the visits from the robot server, above the regular conveyor, which brought special order items to your table we had garlic edamame, black garlic ramen (yumm!) and the larger Sexy Girl roll from the tablet menu.  From the conveyor at $2.50 each, we also enjoyed the small (2-4 pcs) Sushi and Nigiri such as Shrimp and Tuna Tacos, Popcorn Lobster roll, Spicy Tuna Roll and a few more, along with a saketini (with a light up ice cube) and a mango cream soda for my son. The only item which was not a hit was the squid, which was very, very rubbery. They also offer tempura and a few other non-sushi items like potstickers. 3 of us left, full and very happy for $54.  I would recommend this spot as a fun and novel dining experience, and a way to try smaller portions of sushi items you are not sure if you will like--after all, if you don't like the small portions, you are only out $2.50.",

The rotation isn't overwhelming with a large amount of food that may end up just sitting there for longer than one would want sushi to sit out for. Plus everything was fresh and tasty. You are able to order a la carte items as well as choosing from the great rotating dishes. The service is also great! In fact, I somehow got a splinter on my finger (maybe from trying to eat too fast and pressing down too hard on chopsticks), and the female manager must have noticed I was fusing with my finger and brought over these long tweezers to get the splinter out. Luckily I had already pulled the splinter out and saved myself any further embarrassment. This is a cool newer spot, check it out!",

Everything I had was tasty and fresh, I especially enjoyed the black garlic ramen, oysters, deep fried soft shell crab, and salmon and toro nigiri. Considering the plates are ~$2 each, this is a DEAL compared to what you'd find along the Strip. If you're looking for a place where you can indulge without breaking your wallet, this is where you want to be. Will definitely be back on my next trip!",

Love ordering from the IPad and getting food delivered by the little robot above the belt. Service is always prompt and courteous. This visit, we actually had stopped by the 'other' conveyor sushi place in town and was so disappointed by the experience there we had to come to Sapporo to 'cleanse our palates' and get that other place out of our minds as soon as possible! If you're looking to try conveyor belt sushi, stop by the original - Sapporo! Looking forward to many more visits and more awesome sushi!",

My friend and I decided to go during their happy hour which means plates are $1.50 instead of $2.50. There was lack of communication with informing us about happy hour or how it works. We were seated at the happy hour time, so obviously we assumed that we could start eating. Through our 5th plate, we were told that those 5 plates will still be charged as $2.50. Noone told us that we had to WAIT to get a \"happy hour plate?\" They kept telling us how they just started doing happy hour so its a new thing, then they should of at least explained it to us better and even been more lenient if they wanted to keep customers coming back. Also note that its not all plates that are $1.50, I had ordered uni and toro on the ipad and it was still charged $2.50. I came to happy hour hoping to not spend a lot of money. My bill turned out to be the same price as if you went to AYCE somewhere else. Quite disappointed with what happened :/",

My first time here we waited more than 45 mins for an iPad order which put me off, but she quickly turned it around by apologizing and ensuring the order got cancelled.

You might have to navigate the side streets of China Town to avoid rush hour traffic, but you will be happy once you make it here. Parking can be tricky as spots are assigned and not many are available right in front of the restaurant. However, Sapporo staff told me I could park anywhere, even in spots marked for patrons of other businesses. Once inside, you are promptly seated at the table by the sushi-belt. Snatch a plate or two or ten or order a-la carte if your heart desires. iPads with menu options - and \"Request Water\" tab - are at your finger tips at the head of each table. I just love the idea of getting a little bit of everything personally, so I watched the belt, read the upcoming sushi plaques and snatched a plate and three and twelve of them!",

That caused a lot of problems as the evening rush started at 5:00.  Now those who want a late lunch or early supper can enjoy themselves and their meal.

Each plate on the line is $2.50, which can add up quickly. Service was ok but not great.  The rolls come in 3, but you can try them before you decide to get a full roll. Not everything is on the revolving track but a lot of decent options. As for the food the best thing we had by far was the deep fried soft shell crab. All the rolls were pretty standard for a sushi place, definitely had better in other spots. Sexy girl, tiger roll, bonzai.  Some of the misses were the garlic edamame and miso soup which was too salty. Gyoza didn't have a a sauce.The popcorn lobster on the belt ended up being a little cold so be careful when getting hot dishes from the revolver.   They also DO NOT have fresh wasabi! Very surprised. If you've had fresh before you would never want the paste.   Overall the place was a very fun and unique dining experience. Unfortunately the food didn't back up its modern style. Don't think it's a repeat next time the sushi craving comes back around.  3.5 stars but I'll round up for the experience.",

From the food off the conveyor belt, to the food from the robots, and to the food the humans brought.  The scallops and aka ebi were my favorite main entree items.  And the salmon and blue fin tuna were my favorite from the belt.  My lady liked the clams and garlic tuna sushi.  The lady who, I think owned the place, was so surprised at how much I ate, she offered me free ice cream. That's love.",

The concept is fun and the novelty masks any shortcomings a normal sushi bar would never get away with like dry fish or cold tempura. Conveyor belt offerings are usual sushi menu items like garlic tuna, dragon roll, yellow tail and all items are $2.50 each plate. They count your plates to determine your bill. You can also order items directly from the kitchen via your table tablet and have it sent out by a sushi roomba that plays an old cell phone ringer tune. There is an option to call for help in case you might need something like your water glass refilled--but that feature was broken since no one/roomba ever came. Honestly, I felt like I was eating pre-made sushi from the deli section of the market. You don't really know how many trips around the items have made (kind of like lost luggage at the airport carousel). The novelty of an automated restaurant is intriguing but I'd still prefer having sushi prepared fresh as I order. It's worth checking out just to say you've tried it.",

    "text": "4 stars for the experience, really. Here it is, if you are looking to get full on a budget, perhaps you got a big stomache...don't come here! Bring your money to an AYCE. You aren't going to get fancy shmancy rolls jizzed with 3 different type of sauces and a partidge in a pear tree. You aren't going to get a novel of a menu either. Walk....out...now.  If going to an AYCE isn't worthed because you don't got that big of a stomach, but you pay the AYCE price anyway because it makes more sense to or you're not really maximizing your money at an AYCE...then walk...in...now.  I love the layout, the spaciousness, and that there are 3 different conveyor belts for each area of seating. The revolving sushi I've been accustomed to...literally revolves. You'd have to pray no one takes the plates that have been put out...which means you're better off just ordering the dang thing. Their system here with different belts running, perfect. They have a sensor so that if the plate has been revolving around for 30 mins, it gets pulled off ensuring we get the freshest quality.   At 2.50 per plate...it was pretty worthed. Think of it as happy hour pricing if you need a brain-psych. The hubs and I have kinda been off the AYCE train for a bit as we prefer to just ala carte when we  have sushi. This place is perfect for us! My favorite is their garlic tuna nigiri! My hubs has pretty much had all the nigiris they have to offer, and he said they all tasted as fresh as this desert can offer, no chewy pieces, and nothing flooded in sauce! They also offer oysters, however, at 2.50...tis only plated with 1 oyster. Eek.  There are other things available through their iPad ordering system where you will find items that are NOT 2.50. Through this, I have ordered their spicy tuna and salmon skin rolls, veggie tempura, and ramen. I purposely ordered the spicy tuna and salmon skin on each visit to gauge it properly, and both times I thought it needed work.   For one, my salmon skin was soggy each time. Ugh. I was literally playing tug of war when biting into it that it kinda pulled my handroll open and when I looked in it...it was pretty skimpy. They do that illusion trick where they stick the salmon skin out of the wrapmaking you think it's pretty filled when really...whatever peeking out is literally it. My spicy tuna, while spicy...was bland. Most likely will never order those handrolls again. I'm sure they fry it in advance to be efficient...but in that situation, I don't mind a wait. Though I can't speak for the thousands of other people who do.   My vegetable tempura was visibly oily as the plating told me so. I ate it anyway chasing it down over hot green tea. Lol. Despite the plate showing evidence of it not draining long enough...thankfully, my tempura was not soggy and even more thankfully they didn't plate me with vegetables I wanted to throw under the table. Hi mom! I also had the black garlic ramen offered, and sadly...that was bland. Edible...but bland. But I'm here for nigiris! The quality of my nigiris did not fail.  One thing I highly suggest, they should consider giving a menu to large groups. It could just be a laminated menu for people that have noooo way of getting to the iPad to conveniently browse through as the tablet is fixed at the end of the table closest to the belt. With that said, if it's your first time in and you're rolling in deep...you're shorting yourself of the full experience so I suggest coming back with just another person or 2. When you're at the end of the table, you have to make your other friend at the belt go fishing for you. Boring. I'd like to sit where I can scroll through the menu and nab my own plate of choice daghang salamat (thank you very much)  Service has never been neglectful, always attentive without being overly about it, and it was my birthday the last visit....and got my waiter and the manager to sing to me over ice cream! I thought that was fantastic as I knew the waiter was not so willing which I'm sure was out of embarrassment...but after some encouragement from his manager and me asking where's my song...he did!!! Which sounds very diva of me...but if you know my humor and all the little things that led up to that moment...You'd get it. Loosen up a bit will yah. Lol. I really really appreciated It! That was awesome of them. Made my night.  Perfect place to go when you wanna quickly grab some nigiri/sushi. If money isn't on the mind, by all means. I've been waiting for  revolving sushi since I've moved here (2004). While I certainly have had better...Sapporo is definitely a winning option for me and the hubs. I'd say it's even perfect for those with kids who have a small stomach.   You could get away with a stroller in here so no need to fret if the baby is sleeping...roll on in.   It's definitely worth the try or to check off your list especially if going to an AYCE is too much for you.  Enjoy!",

I know revolving sushi is a gimmick, but the restaurant looks like it has great quality fish. I like that revolving plates are one set price at $2.50 a plate. The best thing about Sapporo is their King Salmon! That really is the best salmon I ever had. But it was the only thing I enjoyed at Sapporo. They even had Blue Fin Toro, but most of the fish tasted like they've been sitting out. Similar to something you'd eat at a buffet or Makinos. That made me sad, I want to like this place. Our bill came to be exactly the same as going to AYCE! I think I'll only come for happy hour when I'm craving salmon.",

I was happy to find a sushi conveyor belt restaurant in Vegas at Sapporo Revolving Sushi. They have sushi, a few small warm dishes, Japanese desserts (cake or ice cream) and ramen or udon soup. It is a fun experience to bring friends or family to because at each booth (I believe each booth takes 6 people comfortably or 8 tight), you can grab small plates of sushi ($2.50/plate of 2 or 1). You can also order from the table's tablet (each dish $2.50-$10 and $15-30 for sashimi), which comes to your booth via machine unless it is soup). I only found it hard to tell if it was your table's order or the table on the other side of you.  I do wish they had more non-spicy sushi roll options since my boyfriend doesn't do spice. The spicy rolls that I ordered weren't too spicy to my taste. It seemed that about 75% of the sushi menu contained spice of some sort. I'm sure you can call the waiter to your table to make adjustments to an order, but it would be nice to have an option to do so on your table's tablet.  The ramen ($4.95/Bowl) that we ordered was delicious and enough for two people if also eating other dishes. The Bonzino fish was soft and flavorful inside and crisp on the outside.  I'd say compared to other sushi places, the Nigiri choices that come in 2 at Sapporo are a tiny bit smaller.  They have a bar while you wait to be seated or you can order from your table. It was a 1st experience for my boyfriend, but certainly not his last!",

    "text": "Been wanting to try the first conveyor belt sushi place in Vegas and finally stopped by this place last Friday. My friend and I got there around 6:30 and were promptly seated. The place was nicely decorated and being new, looked really clean. I noticed that almost all the tables were taken and by the time we left, there was a line, so this place is quite popular. It seems like parking is quite limited as a lot of spots have signs reserved for certain stores/businesses. Just to be safe, I ended up parking all the way in the end by Joyful House.  The food was really disappointing though. We tried their salmon carpaccio, which came in 4 pieces. The salmon was good, but the sauce was too overpowering. For nigiri, we tried salmon belly, uni, and chu-toro (we only tried three because after we tried the first one, we knew we didn't want to order more). The fish on the nigiri all tasted ok, except for the salmon belly which tasted a bit fishy to me. The worst thing about the nigiri was the sushi rice. The rice was soft, but packed super tight when they shaped it. It tasted like a mushy rice ball. All the fish are also cut way too thin. With the packed mushy rice and too thin of fish, the nigiri are just bad.   We also tried their ramen. I had the black garlic ramen and my friend had the tonkatsu ramen. We agreed that both ramen were the best dishes we had there and we only ordered them so we wouldn't still be too hungry after dinner LOL.   If you don't see the sushi items you want at the conveyor belt, you can use the ipad on the table to order from the menu. Once the items you order are ready, the kitchen will send them through the conveyor belt (for sushi) or the waitress will bring them out for you (for ramen, appetizers, etc.).   Price for each plate is $2.50. You get 2 pieces for salmon belly and 1 piece for uni and for chu-toro. The ramen was $4.95 for a small bowl and the carpaccio was $7.95. We also ordered hot tea, which was $2. Our total bill came to almost $40 for only that much food. For another 10 bucks, we could've eaten at an AYCE, had better sushi with varieties of appetizers and desserts, and actually be full after dinner.  For only being open for a few weeks, the service was great though. Our waitress was very polite and kept checking on our table. She also made sure our hot tea is never empty for too long.  I don't recommend this place, unless you really just want to check out what the conveyor belt is about. If you're looking for delicious sushi, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Fun place with interesting flavors -- they have much more than the standard sushi offerings -- but you visit for the price, not the quality.  It probably didn't help that we had ultra premium sushi at Yui Sushi Edomae just a few hours prior to eating here with friends.  From the 4.5 star Yelp reviews I had overly high expectations that were not met by the quality.  Most of what we ordered was from the conveyor belt, with a few add ons.   Prices are a very reasonable $2.50 per plate except for items ordered from the iPad at your table.   Some of our more memorable dishes:  * Black garlic ramen:  while it looked good, the broth had no depth or richness of flavor.  3/5  * Cheese tonkatsu:  ordered this out of curiousity.  Interesting fried cheese bits -- worth trying once but a bit dry.  3.5/5  * Gyoza:  Very standard, could be a little crispier.  3.5/5  * Black pepper tuna:  one of the more interesting nigiri.  Almost tasted like jerky.  3.5/5  * Hamachi tacos:  nice crispness from the taco but the fish flavor was a bit muted.  3.5/5  Our biggest gripe was that each piece of fish was consistently flavorless --  barely any of the lush fresh fish flavor from decent quality sushi.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "Solid 4.5 stars.   After 5 visits here, I can confidently recommend this place to others. One of the best compliments I can give is that their service is always friendly, attentive, and courteous. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes for a table when going during peak hours. It's worth the wait.   The sushi is always good. The rice has been hit or miss. I'm picky about the rice, though. Their selection of fish is great. They have something for just about everyone. I can't speak about the rolls since I don't partake in those but rolls are rolls so I'm sure they're fine. The food from the kitchen is also good. The ramen is probably my favorite hot food item. The broth is so tasty, the noodles cooked perfectly, and it's always piping hot.   The conveyor belt action is definitely a fun way to have sushi. I really like that you can also order directly to your table if you don't feel like waiting for the conveyor belt to come around again or if you want a fresh dish made just for you.   I really like Sapporo Revolving Sushi. They're planning to open one in the northwest and at town square soon. Looking forward to having one near my house!",

Sushi is fresh and there isn't much on the conveyor belt but whatever you may want you can order from the tablet on your table. Then it gets delivered on this shuttle tray cart that stops right next to your table. Which was pretty neat. We've heard about these things from a friend that visited Japan but didn't realize there was one here in Vegas. But yet again it is Vegas. There are plenty of rolls here and their very fresh, we even came back the next day for lunch.",

Sure it's a fun idea, but the majority of sushi offered were not great, if not questionable. I think Ayce sushi offers better quality than this place. I was also shocked that the yellowtail was covered in brown sauce and tasted fishy. I knew right then that my stomach was in for a long & painful night. Oh and do not get the sauteed softshell crab, it tasted foul like it wasn't cleaned properly and was filled with poop in the center of the body. It was truly a disaster.   On a positive note, I did enjoy the mini black garlic ramen and the handrolls were filled proportionally so it wasn't all rice. If I had to recommend something, get the salmon skin handroll, spider handroll & salmon crispy tacos.  $2.50 per plate from the conveyor belt seems like a good value, but that shit adds up quick.",

I selected 8 plates - which ranged from one piece of the more expensive stuff (toro) to three or four pieces of some rolls (dragon & California, respectively).  All told, I paid $20 for about the same amount that I usually eat at the AYCE places - AND got to try more things!  If you don't like what's on the conveyor belt, you can order from the menu. Prices are about the same, considering that you get a larger serving with an \"order\".   Be aware that if you're with a group, the people sitting closest to the sushi parade are going to be doing a lot of plate-passing.   Sit so that the belt is moving toward you for the best view!",

    "text": "Amazing concept for a sushi restaurant!   We came into this restaurant VERY hungry. My normal response with sushi is that it will take a minute and I will be hungry for a minute upon sitting down at sushi. The conveyor belt is going as soon as you sit down and you can grab something ASAP.   All of the sushi was really good. All of the plates are on the belt and come around with anywhere from 1-3 pieces on them which is the perfect amount to not get sick of one type of sushi. You take the plates and they are usually $2.50 per plate but we got to the restaurant late and so we were in happy hour pricing , $1.75 per plate. You can eat a lot of sushi and still come out of there paying less than all you can eat which is amazing.   The service is average but I believe it is difficult to maintain a high service level when you don't have to take orders or do any of the normal service basics.   In all this was a great place and I love the concept. I will definitely be returning here :)",

Happy hour plates are only $1.75 each! Reg price $2.50 Sun-Thurs 10pm-12am Fri & Sat 11 PM-2AM   PS, you can also take some TO-GO, it's a great snack to munch on in the middle of the night or the next morning since Vegas hotels only have fridges and no microwaves!

You just grab a plate of what you want as it passes by. Portion sizes range from 2-3 pieces a plate. Each plate was $2.50. If you want premium items or something else besides sushi, there's a menu you can order from also.  Downsides, service wasn't the best.

Ninna was our waitress and was the sweetest, she kept checking on us and making sure we were okay. We were definitely okay! Everything was delicious! We will be going back!",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best sushi places in the valley. They have a tremendous amount of sushi choices as well as noodles and bigger portions if ordered. The place itself is very clean and maintained. The stuff is very friendly and customer service is great! The sushi here revolves on a conveyor and you just choose the ones you want. Most plates have 3 pieces of sushi which is around $2.50 per plate. Some have two pieces which are mostly raw fish. You can order bigger portions on a touch screen located in each table in the restaurant. The sushi is is delicious and so are the soups! Highly recommend this place if you're around Chinatown in Vegas!",

Their sexy girl roll, the filet nigiri, Brussels sprouts app, the halibut roll, the gyoza, Yuzu tuna and the garlic tuna nigiri are all enough to keep me coming back. I haven't had a single thing on their revolving belt and menu that I have not been 100% happy with.   They have happy hour at certain hours where the revolving sushi price is a bit discounted, but even within normal hours, the price is suitable for the quality.   My favorite (as childish as it sounds) is the little \"singing\" robot that comes out when you order from the tablets on the table versus picking up plates off the belt. There's just something so fun about it!   It's great how their concept works, order at your leisure, and servers are around whenever you need a refill or have a special request.  I will definitely continue to consider this a staple for sushi cravings.",

They had maybe 1-2 \"premium\" roll pieces on the conveyor but they were almost always empty the entire time we were here. If you want someone good to each you have to order from the menu and pay full price. The experience was fun, always looking to try new places but then I'm disappointed. They have games good prices on beer for happy hour. The dessert was good, I'll give them that it was the French toast with ice cream, nice crunch on the outside of the bread paired with ice cream it was the best item we tried that night. If your craving a few sushi pieces by all means come here, but if your looking for a meal, I would skip and go to any ayce sushi place in town.",

    "text": "I love the concept of revolving sushi.  The pros - you get to try a variety of sushi at the low price of $2.50 per plate.  Each item comes to you in a covered dish and at the end of the meal they count your plates to determine the total. You can even compete with your friends for the highest stack. (joke. Don't do this unless you have an iron stomach and a deep wallet)  There are some tradeoffs.  You are limited to the sushi types they decide to send out unless you want to order off the full price menu.  Also, depending where you sit along the track, the food may arrive warmer than if you were at the bar or had it brought to you.  Still, everything tasted good and I got to try a few items I might not have know to order.  Fun times",

    "text": "Came here late one night during Sapporo's happy hour! The wait was not very long and my friend and I were seated promptly.   During happy hour, their conveyor belt sushi was about 1.75 a dish, but we also ordered full rolls because we were starving and figured it would be a good head start! Most, if not all the rolls on the speciality menu could also be taken from the conveyor, so if there is a roll you are not sure about on the menu, you can sample it from the belt.   The sushi was good, but in the same vein as other sort of mass produced sushi places (think ayce as opposed to a la carte) i felt the sushi didn't really taste all that impressive. It was certainly good, but it lacked that wow factor that comes when you eat fresh fish, which makes sense as most of these sushi servings have likely been out for hours for them to be discounted during happy hour. All in all though it's a nice place to go for food and a social gathering!",

Because it was conveyer style I enjoyed the unique aspect but overall disappointed on the quality of food and drink, which is what we came for primarily. Perfect for portions though: I don't eat much and my husband eats a lot so he tried a lot while I was full after a couple plates that I traditionally love and tried 1/2 of two others that looked appetizing/fun. Husband had many more and found a few he got more of. Service was okay but because you serve yourself it was fine. The tea however was the worst I've ever experienced and made me want to cry.... I love tea and even enjoy really cheap ones usually but suggest against the hot and cold teas here, ick",

I didn't get the bartenders name but the man who works on Friday night is awesome! Thank you sir for the customer service and being so helpful.  All I have to say is how can you not love a place that charges $2.50 a plate! My goodness I ate so much food while I was here and I paid a lot less than I would have at an AYCE. The conveyor belt is such a unique idea and I love that you can just taste a little bit of everything without having to commit to an entire roll. Everything was fresh both days I was here and tasted amazing. I'm very picky with sushi and their wasn't one thing I didn't like.  If you don't see what you want on the belt you can order off the menu and they have plenty of options and many beautiful looking dishes. If you order off the menu the chefs send it out on a cute little robot that comes to your table. I have to admit that got a laugh out of me numerous times!    I choose to stick with the food on the belt but my friend ordered pork ramen that was amazing! I brought my mom on Friday since she is new to sushi and she loved everything as well! The one stand out dish to me was their Cajun and peppered albacore. Yummy!   Next time I want to try out their happy hour which I heard is the best time to go. Everything on the conveyor belt is suppose to drop down to $1.50 and you can grab a beer for $3. If you are on a budget this is an excellent place to go with your family.",

It can take a little bit for those items to come out. So do that quick. The food on the belt is great also. We love that we can sit down and start eating immediately and truly love the quality. Price wise it comes out cheaper than some of the AYCE places, so that's a plus!   If you like sushi, check this place out. It gets busy so don't be surprised if there's a wait!

All the salmon nigiri was delicious (king salmon, salmon belly). The smoked salmon tasted like lox so maybe pass on that one. The fatty tuna could've been better.. I was pleasantly surprised by the Alaskan halibut, it was so buttery. The lobster roll was good. The rainbow roll could've been better.  Eating here was the highlight of our trip! A nice place to have dinner before clubbing.  They also have a menu where you can send the kitchen you order - we didn't try this option, but the neighboring table looked like they enjoyed their special items!

    "text": "Yep, that's right. Vegas finally has their own revolving sushi joint. In the sea of AYCE sushi spots, Sapporo is joining the many options for sushi in Sin City!  After hearing about this place recently opening (Dec 2017), me and a few friends stopped by for dinner and enjoyed ourselves. Don't get me wrong, it's a great place. The fish quality is good and the service was very attentive and nice. But I think I still prefer AYCE...   At $2.50 a plate, they can really stack up and we ended up paying about the same, if not more, per person as you could get at AYCE. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by the price at revolving sushi joints in Hawaii. But $2.50 for some of the items they offer is a little overpriced.   You can either order from the iPad or grab directly from the belt. I tend to like ordering from the iPad (so you know it's made somewhat more fresh)  In the end, we enjoyed ourselves and left thoroughly stuffed. The restaurant is very clean and nicely designed. It was a little empty when we were there but here's hoping more people catch on.",

I love getting to try different foods without having to purchase ayce because I never eat as much as ayce is worth. I love spending $10-15 for how much I would've eaten at an ayce place. I definitely recommend going here for a unique experience.",

    "text": "I had family in town, from Hawaii, and we were stoked to dine here since our usual spot back home, Genki Sushi, had the same exact concept. The host, Christian (not 100% with his name), was attentive and the most helpful of the staff during our experience here. This plan was given three stars because of him. Our server was a Caucasian lady who was really nice but wasn't around much? She came around like once? Other than that, the busser and host was always there to answer our questions or tend to our water refills. During our FIRST order on the Ipad, we ordered a bunch of nigiris, ramen for my son, and two udon bowls for my nieces. We probably had three rounds of orders through the Ipad and realized their udon never came at all. My cousin noticed the table that was sat maybe 10-15 minutes after us, had their udon orders. It definitely killed our vibe since my nieces had a long day of cheer competition. We first brought it to the attention of the busser, then the host, then our \"server\". Once they got it, my cousin wanted to take it to go but again, no one was around to bring to-go containers. Everyone in our party was done eating while they just got started on theirs. Poor girls. Don't get me wrong, they were all nice but if they came around more to make sure our orders were brought to our tables and scarfed down into our hungry bellies, this would've been a better experience. As for the menu itself, it's okay...I think it's not as generous as what we're used to. Hence, I'd rather get some sushi at an AYCE spot than here. We left hungry and dissatisfied but, tried to make the best of our experience. I guess I had HIGH expectations for this place...maybe that's why the outcome seems more disappointing. Would I come back? I don't know.",

    "text": "This place brings rotating sushi to a new level! I've been to rotating sushi places in Asia, but this place is more hip and fun. Instead of bar seating, there are private booths that surround the sushi conveyor belt. Service was really good since the place was pretty empty. Our waiter came by to explain how each plate off the conveyor belt was $2.50 and how to work the iPad. Numerous other people came by to fill up water and pick up plates.  Each dish on the conveyor belt is never left on there for more than thirty minutes, meaning the dish is fresh. The plates typically have two pieces of sashimi or three pieces of a roll. Along with common sashimi pieces and rolls, there were some trendy items, such as sashimi tacos or unique rolls. From the belt, I had a salmon taco and octopus nigiri. We then ordered a few items from their main menu off the iPad. Their prices are pretty good. We ordered a $5 small bowl of ramen, $7.50 tiger roll, and $2.50 squid nigiri. The tiger roll was medium sized and beautifully presented. The ramen noodles were delicious, but their broth was too salty and there were not enough toppings. I really enjoyed the quality of the squid nigiri. It's incredibly fun when the iPad pieces come out, since they send this robot that zooms down the conveyer belt to where you sit!   I loved how modern and chic this place is. The prices are too high for me to order everything I wanted, so if I wanted to gorge, I would go for AYCE.",

The small plates on the conveyor belt are all a fixed price and you are charged by how many you take. This is great because instead of ordering an entire roll and discovering you don't like it, you can take a small plate of 3 to 4 pieces And not waste as much money if you don't care for it. You can also order full size or additional items from the tablet at your table.   Kids love this place and I recommend it if you are a sushi lover.",

    "text": "I've been here right at opening and several times late at night during Happy Hour. I can honestly say that the food is as fresh at the end as it is at the beginning (or vice-versa). Even though this is not an AYCE place, take into consideration the price of 2-piece nigiri at most Japanese restaurants. The regular price for nigiri here is half (or less than half) of what you would pay elsewhere (and even better during Happy Hour)! I also like the selection of rolls on the conveyor belt. They are regularly priced at an equal fraction of what you would pay for a whole roll on the menu, so you can try a wider selection of rolls instead of filling up on just a few. I have noticed that Happy Hour is getting a lot more crowded and busier. It is nice that they will hold your place if not everyone in your party is present, but they will not seat you or give you a table yet (which is fair, given how busy they can get). Now I don't know whether is was just because the last time I went during Happy Hour was during a weekend or if it is now generally applied, but compared to the first Happy Hour I went to, the price has increased. Overall, it is a really good place to go to get your sushi fix without feeling you need to overindulge to get your money's worth!",

The names and ingredients of each item is available via the iPad set-up on each table. You can also order full sized rolls and entrees on the iPad including ramen, miso soup, nigiri (raw fish with rice), sashimi plates (raw fish without the rice), and dessert! The set up is very time efficient because a majority of the orders are delivered to your party's table with a robot. There isn't much interaction with the servers unless you order drinks and prior to being seated; however, most of them are very friendly! For the most part, the quality of the raw fish is comparable to those of AYCE sushi joints throughout Las Vegas; however, I prefer coming here because I don't feel compelled to over eat. My favorites here include: the lobster roll (don't get this confused with the popcorn lobster roll, which is just California rolls w/ flavorless fried lobster on top), garlic edamame, tuna tacos, and the spicy tuna handroll.

If you're looking for excellent quality try elsewhere but quantity and variety this is the place to come! It's also super fun for the kids! Oh before I forget you can also order from the menu and a little robot cart will bring it right to your table. We will be back! They also have a happy hour  late at night.",

There is a tablet for you to order special items and appetizers from as well, so you are not only restricted to whats rotating. By the way, the items are being kept fresh because everything is getting grabbed amd there is room to make new. When you place the special orders with your waiter or via tablet, it arrives on a moving belt to your table. At the end of your meal, your plates are counted (Each rotating plate is the same price) and your bill will be tallied.  I'm definetely goung to bring my friends here to check this place out!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try a revolving sushi spot for years and was very excited when my girl told me there was one in town.  I jumped at the chance to meet her there and try it out, even though it was pretty late.  Got there and the place was large, which was surprising due to it being in Chinatown.  Even though it was large, half of the restaurant was closed which resulted in us waiting for an hour to get in, even though it was past 11:00 pm.  Maybe they didn't have enough chefs scheduled that late, idk.  I would definitely recommend staffing more though in the future, especially since it is HH late at night.   Finally sat down and it was so cool!  The food just comes around your tables and you grab what you want!  I know this is the core concept but for someone who has never experienced that, it was pretty dope.  Normally the plates are $2.50 each but during HH the plates were $1.50!  $1.50 sounds awesome until you find out that each plate has like 3 bites of food on them, which again, I suppose is part of the concept, to try a bit of everything without breaking the bank.  The sushi itself was just alright too, nothing over the top or amazing although I did see a few things I haven't before (sushi tacos and some lobster thing).  Let's just say I was lucky I wasn't that hungry or I would've ended up spending a whole lot more than $9.  Yes, I could've ordered whole rolls and other dishes at full price from the iPad on the table, and yes, I could've seen them delivered to my table on a cool light train but as I said earlier, I wasn't terribly hungry.   Concept: Awesome/Awesome Decoration: Pretty nice Service: Staff was very very nice but when everything but seating and drinks is automated it makes tipping a bit weird. Food: Not bad sushi for the plates that I had. Hipster factor: Yes Will I go here again?: Yes because my friends are dying to try it and I can always go for a few cheap bites of sushi.  I also want to try their other dishes!  Tips:  Go during HH.  Don't go if you are really hungry/have a big appetite and are on a budget.  Go to experience something new.  Prepare for a long wait if half of the restaurant is closed and there is any semblance of a line.  Definitely a cool experience though.",

I've never been to any type of conveyor food restaurant so it was interesting to me to see the mechanisms. we were told it would be a 10 minute wait and asked us to sign in. once seated, we ordered drinks which came promptly and ordered some ramen. while waiting for the ramen, we started to pick and choose which rolls we wanted from the conveyor and just grabbed them. i like the idea of not having to wait for your food to be made or cooked. they count your bill per plate. i think we had about 8 plates, plus two small bowls of ramen and drinks, the bill came out to around $40 for 2 people and i think we spent about an hour there. i would definitely recommend this place and i will be going back.",

    "text": "I'll start out by saying that my boyfriend and I can eat a lot of sushi, so if you're like us, take caution. Revolving sushi is a neat concept and a fun experience, but it does tend to add up if you order a lot. Plates here are $2.50 each no matter what it is, which I'm assuming is to help streamline the tally at the end. A bit different than other revolving sushi spots I've been to where the price will vary depending on the item.   The quality of the nigiri really surprised me. I had some tasty plates, such as the hamachi and the maguro. On the flip side, if you come at a down time, you'll have the same six rolls going around the conveyor. You also have the option to order other sushi/side dishes off a tablet that is at your table. There is a little robot train thing that delivers your food above the conveyor, which is adorable. To send it back to the kitchen after you grab your plate, just press the button.   I'd say that if you are coming here with a big appetite, do expect to pay more than an AYCE restaurant (it was about $75+ tax/tip for the two of us). However, it's a cool experience and the food is good too.",

I mean if you've been to Japan, Fatty tuna is the best sushi there is out there. I've tried other places that have fatty tuna in Las Vegas, and of course they were good, but it was just too damn expensive. $2.50 for 1 piece isn't really that bad.   I would've given a 5 Star, but the last time we went there, they were all out of Fatty Tuna, which totally sucked and not worth the money I spent there without the fatty tuna. Oh and also the train wasn't working, the one where you order through the iPad and it brings you the sushi through a train. Yes that wasn't working.   Overall, this place is the best when they have fatty tuna in stock. I hate that I have to call every time asking for fatty tuna tho. I'm sure it'll get better through the time being. I mean they did just open a few months ago.",

The green tea cake is good too. They have a lot of options to choose from and the plates come with 2 rolls which is good because you can try a lot more different rolls. I really like it when they have dessert on the sushi rotating belt because you get to try more. The employees are nice and are good about filling your drink. The booths are a good size.

However, this place does not sacrifice quality for novelty. It is actually functional and practical. Let me tell you more.  Right when you walk in, you will notice the modern decor and cleanliness of the restaurant. Textured walls with warm lighting gave way to a sleek stainless steel conveyor belt  displaying a menagerie of covered plates of sushi. I was greeted right away and asked to write my name down for the waiting list. There was quite a few people waiting ahead of me, but it wasn't too bad. There was a mixed crowd of couples, friends in pairs, large groups, and every age group imaginable. I love how this new concept is bringing everyone together to have some great food easily. It wasn't before long before my name was called and I was seated along side the belt. Rows of food with a name sign right before it rolls towards you and you can just pick it off and set it on your table. The owner came by to go over how the conveyor belt works and showed me how to order other kitchen items on the iPad. He was incredibly helpful, patient, and hard working. He also explained that all of the rotating plate items are on a 30 minute timer, so after 30 minutes the unsold plate automatically gets kicked out and is not served. The fish served is also flown in daily. Hooray for freshness!   All the white plates on the conveyor belt has a set price so it is easy to keep track of how much you are going to spend by how many plates you stack up. So if you get pick happy, your tab can run as high as your plates! The special kitchen items on the iPad ranges from single hand rolls, to ramen bowls, full sushi rolls, desserts, appetizers ( like marinated pork belly ) and more of things I can't pronounce but I am sure to try in the future. If you order items from the iPad, the robot Roomba looking thing on top of the conveyor belt will roll out to you, flash some lights, and tell you your food is ready. You just pick up your dish and then it goes back in the kitchen area! So simple, but I just love it! I ordered the soft shell crab, tuna taco, yellowfin taco, and pork belly just to have it come out. Yes, I was amused by the robot, but a robot that brings me my food is a robot that makes sense. All of the sushi was really fresh. No fishiness or mushy textures. Just clean and bright flavors.  They are not big on putting mayo and creamy sauce in everything, do for once you can actually taste the quality of the fish you are eating. However, if you are into that yum yum sauce and the like you can find something on the iPad menu. The ramen noodle soup was brought out by a real person so that it won't spill. Smart. The soft shell crab was ok, not as soft as I wanted, but everything else was top notch. One of my favorites was the yellowfin taco. Firm and meaty with the crispy wonton taco shell. It was the perfect two bite tuna delight for me.  Service was really good and I think for being open on their sixth day, they are doing a great job. Everyone was working really hard and moving very fast. The owner was even helping  out with the tables and refilling drinks. The dedication and pride really shows in the product and how good the place looks. I think the growing popularity of this spot will only make them busier. I have no doubt that with the continued passion of the owner, chef, and workers of this new sushi concept in Vegas that this place will be a success. I will definitely be back and highly recommend.",

First time I came, my experience was really bad, so I decided to give it another chance, and it's still the same. Our server came by our table two times, that's it. It was to take our drink order and bring our drinks. He didn't come to give us our refills or check up on us, NOTHING. When we were finish eating, he didn't even come by for 20 minutes to give us our check so we just went up to the front.  Moving onto the food, it was okay. The fish just didn't taste as fresh to me, the rice was a little too hard and warm for the fish. I also saw a couple of the nigiri lids were kinda foggy. Me and my boyfriend ordered 3 hand-rolls, the T.N.T., and a couple nigiris.  Our iPad kept breaking down too and we had to have someone come over three times.  We'll give it another try one last time, but for the meantime, we will be taking our business elsewhere.",

The wife and I were greeted immediately by two well dressed hosts/ waiters.  Seated immediately and given the quick run down on how to order.  Pretty easy, either pick up from the revolving conveyor belt, or order from the iPad like device at each table.  We started with the revolving selection and found familiar along with items we had not seen before.  We chose New Zealand King Salmon, Red Snapper Yuzu  w/ fresh wasabi, albacore, mackerel and Japanese Mackeral, Tomago, Baby Yellowtail, Yellowtail.  All were very fresh and tasty.  We ordered from the computer a Banzi Roll, Caterpillar Roll, Dragon Roll, Deep Fried Soft Shell crab, tuna roll, spicy salmon hand roll, Soft Shell crab hand roll, unagi, and a spicy yellowtail hand roll, and Shishito peppers. All items were freshly made and tasted very good.  While everything was fresh and good, there wasn't anything that really knocked my socks off.  But it is definitely a place to satisfy a sushi crave quickly.",

Nigiri sushi is all right, the only dish I enjoyed was the toro. Other than that, without the revolving part it would just be another mediocre sushi place.   They do have food that you could order on an iPad that then transport your food onto a serving device. Some of the prices vary from $-$$.   Great experience, but I probably wouldn't make it my go to sushi spot.",

    "text": "This was certainly a new and pleasant experience for my friends and I. Informative too.  Upon entry, the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. Our server, Jay (?) was nice to explain the process of food going around the restaurant, such as chefs putting fresher items on the conveyor belt after every 30 minutes. Another detail to note was that, certain nigiri dishes had to be ordered specifically from the table's iPad (e.g. uni). The amount of stacked plates were also counted at the end of the meal to calculate your total, along with the billed amount from the iPad. For example, my friends and I pulled off 16 plates off the conveyor belt ($2.50/each), and ordered at least 5 other dishes (primarily special rolls and dessert) from the iPad (alone, totaled around $96) with a bottle of sake. Total bill came out to be around $145 (includes tax, but excludes gratuity).  Back to service... Knowledgeable and accommodating staff was appreciated. Also liked the way Jay had us check the bottle of sake (right brand and size) was alright with us before bringing out a cold one to chill in an ice bucket. Not to mention that he and his co-workers checked on us throughout the meal, and managed to throw in a joke or 2 around with us (e.g. we ordered all three dessert cakes).  The food, itself, was good. Made me think of what's served at other sushi restaurants around town, so it's up to par in terms of quality. I think I just appreciated the overall experience as a nice introduction to this kinda restaurant.  If I could mention one suggestion, it would be to stack the covers instead of the plates from the conveyor belt. I understand that the items need to be counted/tracked, but the covers looked neater stacked on the side, and did not have food (crumbs) on the plates to look at during our entire meal.",

    "text": "Sapporo is great to bring friends who are apprehensive to trying sushi. The great selection of non-sushi items helps ensure there's something for everyone!  Conveyor Belt Sushi: I loved the signage that leads with the sushi following.  The plates have two pieces to make it easy to try new sushi at $2.50 a plate, fantastic.  Upper Level VIP delivery Sushi & More: If you order sushi and other items from the kitchen, it will get delivered to you via a motorized tray that rides on the track above the conveyor belt.  It stops at your table, flashes a yellow light and a robotic voice instructs you to remove your order. Very cool, your social media fans will love it.  The conveyor belt sushi was fresh for sampling.  The sushi rolls we ordered from the kitchen was even fresher.  The half size ramen bowl, scallops, sushi tacos, scallops and steak were flavorsome.  The portions are smaller sampling sizes but good quality dishes for a great price.  Fantastic.  Ambiance: Contemporary lighting and decor, dark wood tables, black leather booths, pairs well with the conveyor belt for a clean high tech look.  Family night or date night, the vibe works just as well.  Sapporo just cracked my list of best places for a first date.  If the vibe is good, order slowly and try new dishes with your date.  Create that new memory together.  If the vibe is one star, order less dishes, save money and get that dessert dish delivered when the time is right.  Either way, the conveyor belt and touch pad ensures you have constant food possibilities all night.  Enjoy the food and enjoy the experience!  =)",

The fish to rice ratio is ridiculous, they feed you more rice than fish - which is good to keep expenses low but bad for quality.  Most if not ALL their nigiri is dry, the rolls are overly sauced and often too soggy when it comes out from the kitchen.  The customer service is nonexistent, literally, you have to flag someone down.. but they are however quick to question \"tipping.\" LOL!",

    "text": "The first and only conveyor belt sushi in Vegas. Despite the roots and reasoning behind conveyor belt sushi restaurants (to sell cheaper cuts of fish to the masses), it's still a neat concept to me. You plop yourself to your seat and wait for food to come to you. If you must eat, might as well go all out lazy!  I've only been to under 10 conveyor belt sushi restaurants in the US and other countries and my review would be based on those experiences.  So, hooray for Vegas having conveyor belt/ revolving sushi. The biggest gripe I have is that the food selection is very limited. Tuna, salmon, crab, tamago, spicy tuna, a sprinkling of fatty tuna, surf clam, caterpillar roll, and a few others + dessert. I'm not sure what their policy is when it comes to taking off a plate that's been around a few times. They have an iPad at each table so if you want a specific item, you can order it and a little tray comes zipping above your head - you have to be alert though and pay attention because you might be grabbing other people's food across from you. If the light is on on your side, it's yours. However, their iPads need to be reset a lot.  The quality of their fish is just okay even during their first week of being open. Each plate is like $2.50 depending on what you get, you'll get 1-4 pieces per plate for the same price. You pay based on the number of plates.",

Would be much better if they found a better solution for that in order to make space for the table. Aside from that, the salmon was amazing. The rolls were good. I will definitely be back.

The sushi/fish is super fresh that you can really taste the quality of their menu items. My favorite item was the garlic tuna. Everything on the belt was $2.50 a plate and if you didn't see an item you wanted on the belt, you can order it from their touch pad menu and have it sent to you on the custom order belt.",

Some things still need work such as their iPad app that tends to crash, but it was a fun experience.  One of the best kept secrets of the entire menu is actually the black garlic ramen for $4.25. The portion is smaller than what you would typically get, but the flavor is way better than any of the other ramen shops around town.   Each sushi plate that passes by will run  you $2.50 each with most common pieces featuring two pieces of nigiri. Some of the premium fish such as bluefin tuna will only have one piece. Unfortunately, they did not having toro during our visit. I really enjoyed the salmon belly and the yellowtail mini taco.   All in all, the bill still ran around $20 per person. If you really want your fill, AYCE sushi still might be the way to go for a little more, but I would definitely come back for a couple of bowls of ramen with a few pieces of sushi!",

They also have an iPad on the table where you can place orders for items that are not on the belt.   That iPad on the table is great!  You don't have to wait for a waiter to order anything and soon as you order the food comes out quick.  The green tea cake omg was delicious!  Light and just the right amount of sweet.   They have cone sushi which is my favorite!  I wish they had more things like chicken and the squid.  More side dishes to pair with the sushi.  It is $2.50 per plate.  So pile em up!  Fun experience and great food! Will be back!",

The ease of the conveyor belt, on-table tablet ordering, and machine-served special orders have truly impacted my ideals of a sushi restaurant experience. If you'd like that, then definitely come on by. As for the food, it was on point; that's all I can really say. Nothing bad fortunately, but nothing super extraordinary either. I quite enjoyed the Crunchy Lobster Roll special order and every nigiri served to my on the belt. To have those plates priced currently @ $2.50 each led to a very inexpensive lunch.  The price, coupled with fine sushi and a very unique experience, puts Sapporo high on my list of great sushi places. Definitely head on in!",

Atmosphere 5/5 Everything is so futuristic in a way, there is a conveyer belt transferring small dishes around the entire restaurant. Whatever you want you grab it and they tally the price up later. Booths were large and spacious. It was a great place to sit and eat  Service 5/5 You order through a tablet and the food comes out on a tray and stops at your table. Can't really complain about robot service lol  Food 5/5 Amazing from start to finish. We ended up ordering way more food then we expected to. We got the Popcorn lobster roll which was my favorite. It had fried lobster on top of the rolls which gave a great crunchy texture to the soft sushi. We also got the Mexican, and some other rolls I can't fully remember. Oh! And the deep fried brussel sprouts, which were charred to perfection. Everything was beyond amazing. I highly recommend coming here!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time with someone who has came during the soft opening. This is my first revolving/conveyor belt sushi experience.   Located in between Decatur and Arville on Spring Mountain, next to Hotai Furniture, it is the new \"hype\" thing to come to Las Vegas ! There was a small wait as they had not opened the standalone section to the right. The restaurants layout is a bit different from what you usually see in other revolving sushi places. Typically they'd have 1 line that runs through all the tables. For Sapporo, they have 1 that runs through 2 sections, and another small one that runs the 3rd section. As they were still in the early stages of opening, they didn't open the 3rd section completely.   We were sat in the new section shortly and was greeted by the waiter and owner, Freddy. Throughout the dinner, he showed his passion and timeline on how this restaurant came to be. Who would have guessed it took 3 years for this all to come to be? To even hear chains like Kula, etc had failed as well !   We had ordered a Kirin draft beer to share and then we had waited for the conveyor belt to be filled. There was some deal for draft beer NOT including blue moon (of course ..) so we picked Kirin.   I had a few friends come here previously, including her, and showing pictures of how amazing the uni and toro looked, so i was really looking forward to these two, as well as some other items.   Sexy Mama Roll, Tiger Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll - Can't really say too much about rolls. As expected to taste like whats in it. Can't really judge rolls that well. Lol  Salmon Nigiri - Fresh fatty salmon sushi. What more can i say? Can't say much about the rice. Its ok. Prefer more of a vinegar-y taste but thats all personal preference   Orange Salmon - Very similar to the sake orenji at Yonaka. Slices of fatty salmon belly on top of wedges of orange, topped with orange masago with yuzu oil around. This dish is like an orange/citrus bomb. The salmon was very good but im afraid the orange/citrus covers the salmon flavor almost completely. Need a tone down on that citrus explosion !   Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll - Lightly battered crispy soft shell crab hand roll. pretty yummy overall over those who like soft shell crab. Never seen this before. May prefer just a straight up normal soft shell crab appetizer vs handroll though. But thats not their fault. Just personal preference  Red snapper Nigiri, Surf Clam, - Very typical nigiri  Yellowtail and Salmon Taco - by special order train. This reminded us of the tostadas at Soho that we used to love getting for happy hour. Small bite sized tacos with fresh fish was quite yummy. Good little bite sized snack/appetizer ! .... as if everything else wasnt bite sized anyway XD   Uni Nigiri - creamy sea butter, comparable to a specially ordered tray of uni i had the night before from Santa Barbara.   Toro Nigiri - this first found, was disappointing. Was not how i had expected the toro to be like. This was grabbed from the conveyor belt. Quite lean to be called toro.   Green tea roll cake - Specialty dessert created by on-site japanese patissier.   Toro (Round 2) - before i go into talking about this round, here's some back story. I was talking to freddy for like the 5th time during this meal and he had mentioned in the system, there should be different selections for grade or type of toro you are ordering. Makes sense since there's theres typically chu-toro, o-toro, or just different grades in general. If i were to \"grade\" the first found, it would be borderline normal tuna vs any part of the belly. I had a round two sent out, and this was completely different. Melt in mouth, fatty goodness. Even the marbling of the fat and color and look was completely different. THIS is what toro should be, AT LEAST. I'm not a fan of otoro as it has too much fat, to point where its almost more fat than flesh, some with thick banding of fat. This piece was more similar to like chutoro. Which was great !   Anything you see on the belt can be ordered on the iPad. Only downside of it all is you dont get to see prior to receiving it.  Which is what i did for the 1st round of toro. The 2 that was out on the belt didn't look good so i took a chance and ordered it on iPad. Nope. Lol Of course since it was still soft opening, there were still glitches in the system that had to be worked out. Can't ding them for that. Would love to come back to try again to see what new items they will have !",

All of the food I tried  was delicious and fresh. Service was excellent. Great atmosphere. Highly recommend for a fun night out!",

There are various types of sushi that go around on the conveyor belt, and the good part is, if you want something else, you can order it on the menu and the waiter will bring it out to you. Even if you like something on the conveyor belt, you can order that too. Ordering separately is easy as everything is placed on the iPad looking screen. The service is FAST too! I ordered a couple of items that were not on the conveyor belt and they had it out in less than 5 min. There is no all you can eat so all the plates on the conveyor belt is $2.50 per plate. Probably not your first go-to place if you're starving and want to pig out on AYCE, but it is a different experience of eating sushi and you can try plates before you order more on the iPad.",

Also I'm sure I'm wrong but I feel like the left side revolver (from the doors) has the most selection. Lol they have an amazing plum wine also. Staff is always friendly and attentive.

    "text": "On our first night at Vegas, we didn't want to eat buffet but something good and light so we came here after looking thru yelp.  All the plates on the conveyor/revolving belt were $2.50, there are nigiri sushi (1-2 pieces), different types of sushi rolls (3-4 pieces), appetizers, tacos (salmon, tuna, shrimps) and desserts.  You can also place orders, like ramens, handrolls, and specials from the kitchen (like sashimi) from the tablet that attached to each table. The main complaint I have was the Gyu Katsu.  It was a very small piece of pork cutlet, that was cut into 8 pieces.  Each piece was half of my thumb and very thin. For the price of $8.95, it is not worth it at all.  If it was really tasty, then I guess it would be OK, unfortunately the meat was so small, I could only taste the batter. Hence I knocked one star. There are several star items I like: mini tacos (all of them were good), black garlic ramen (we have ordered once of each and this one has the best taste), and all the nigiri sushi were very fresh.  For the 5 of us, we ate a total of 24 plates and ordered a small sashimi (9 pieces of fish for $14.95, slices were on the thin side compared to other Japanese sushi restaurant), 4 bowls of ramen, gyu katsu, and drinks.  The cost is averaged out to be about $25 per person.  And we were full but none of us was a big eater so if you are an AYCE person, you may want to go to an AYCE and paid a little more, because the cost would come out to be the same. But we will revisit this place if we come back to Vegas because we don't like AYCE.",

All the rolls are either made with crab mix, shrimp tempura, or spicy tuna. When I asked to have a roll made with regular tuna, I was told they couldn't do that. When I asked why, the waitress said there is too much of a price difference between the spicy tuna and the sushi tuna for them to do it. I have heard this excuse before, and what it means is that the restaurant is buying tuna that is not sushi grade then dumping it into a blender with a bottle of hot sauce and that is what goes into those rolls. There is so much hot sauce and other items in the rolls that you don't notice the fish you are eating isn't meant to be consumed raw. They do this to maximize profits, by cutting corners. This is why they won't swap out the regular tuna to make the roll not spicy. Meanwhile, they are charging $9 - $13 per roll which is the same as the other restaurants in town that don't buy cheap fish.  I went twice for the novelty of it, but I won't go back. I question the integrity of an establishment that does this.",

The location is very convenient, just off I-15, not too far from the the Strip, and a few exits away from the Airport. We wanted something that didn't have us sitting around waiting for our food, so this was a perfect option for us. It was around 1pm when we got inside the restaurant and we were seated right away. It got much busier towards the end of our meal, the tables and booths were filling up quick. The food was very good. The quality was definitely better than any other conveyor sushi places that I've had. They ensure freshness by removing plates that has been on the belt every 30 minutes or so.   They had an array of nigiri sushi,rolls, and other selections like poke tacos and popcorn lobster.    All the plates on the belt was 2.50, which wasn't bad especially for the quality of sushi they had. I will definitely be coming back during our next visit!",

This place is MODERN, and I just think the concept of the revolving sushi (and other food besides sushi) is SO cool. They have a set price for every plate you pick of the revolver which is supposed to give you a little of everything and if you like it, you order a bigger plate ($2.50) and in the end they count how many plates you have and add that to your total. You can also order \"bigger\" meals off of the iPads! If you order any type of roll, they come out on the revolver. The food is GREAT! We came back to order the Lobster Roll and the noodles are great as well as the Black Cod. We also tried the Green Tea cake and it was AMAZING. Prices are reasonable (a special roll of 9 is $7.50). Service is great, everyone is friendly, and it's just something new from the Eastern Coast. If I'm ever back in LV, I'll definitely be stopping back at this gem.",

I'm a hardcore sushi person but it was the Black Garlic Ramen soup that was absolutely scrumptious--I know it's a goofy word but trust me, the right word. Conveyor belt sushi that really goes to the next level.  An RF label under the plates signals to staff to dispose of anything circling the dining room more than 30 minutes!  But I loved the robot that delivers special orders on a track suspended over the conveyor belt! Just grab your order and press the return button and the robot sails silently back into the kitchen.  We ate like little little piggies and the bill was a Benjamin for 4 people (no liquor). Our server Elina, was a super sweetie.",

We had the reverse late night happy hour 10pm-midnight when every plate was 1.50 (regular 2.50), beers and sake was half off as well.  The conveyor belt bringing out certain items ordered stopping at the table was entertaining to watch.  Sushi and ramen (4.25 without an egg) was good.  I like the fact that no sushi stays on the belt for more than half an hour.  The kids loved it and they do have a variety to choose from the belt that comes around.  They have a full menu with other items (where we ordered with the kiosk).  Great service and friendly staff.  Wish they had one of these in the SF Bay Area.",

At lunch time, during the week, we were able to get a table right away. Definitely check this place out, you won't be sorry; and don't only choose items from the conveyor belt because you must also experience having your food delivered by a \"train\"!",

The food here is absolutely delicious and I feel so comforted to see the store's owners constantly keeping a watchful eye on how the store I ran and how the food is prepared. They work close with the hosts and wait staff and their attentiveness certainly made me appreciate and respect the work they are putting into the restaurant. It is extremely atypical for management to be hands on but going to Sapporo Revolving Sushi I can see that it makes an impeccable difference. The quality of their food is unmatched in Vegas, their drink specials are great priced-not to mention the bartender is friendly an the bar area is immaculate. The entire restaurant has a seamless, clean, elegant, and advanced design. I high recommend this place if you want to eat at a restaurant that champions high quality food, advanced technology (Revolving Sushi is no joke!), and wait staff that goes out of their way to make sure you are very well tended to! This is Revolving Sushi at its finest and I had the most amazing experience being seated quickly, my friends and I had our questions answered immediately, our table cleared, and assisted by staff without any hesitation or little to no wait. I look forward to coming back to Sapporo Revolving Sushi in the next few days!",

So if you look at other peoples pictures and the name of the place, the sushi is served on a conveyer belt for the most part.   So first off it's a fairly nice place when you go into the restaurant. There's a little waiting area but not too many seats are available to those who are waiting. I was standing with my friend for 15 - 20 minutes. When we were seated we ordered drinks and started picking things off. I got edamame and it was a good amount off of the conveyer belt. I also took spicy tuna, crunchy lobster, and gyoza. Now I wasn't the biggest fan of the gyoza but everything else was fine.   I loved the experience, the atmosphere, and the food. It was a very sporadic experience in all honesty. You only have a few moments to decide whether you want something and if you don't decide then it's gone till the next round. I think this place would be fun for truth or dare.   Overall, I'll definitely come back here again.",

They should consider making it all you can eat. The fact that they let all the empty/dirty plates pile up as you're eating really turns you off. They do this so they can count the number of plates to add to your tab when you're ready for the check. A process should be put in place (e.g. how dim sum places stamp a card), so that you don't have a pile of dirty plates sitting next to you as you're eating. The staff was nice, but there's little to no interaction because of the tablets on the table. The concept is cool, but so many improvements could be made to make the experience better. I wouldn't come back unless they make improvements on the overall experience.",

They had only been open for about a week and a half when we went , so our server was kind of new to everything. Our wait to get seated was about 15 minutes on a Friday evening around 7pm. The whole conveyor belt thing is pretty neat. Each plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50. Nigiri will either have 2 pieces or 1 piece depending on the fish. Special rolls are about 4 pieces.  They have an ipad at each table as well where you can order other items. The food ordered from the ipad will either be delivered by your waiter or come out on the robot straight to your table. It was like a mini surprise each time the robot came to our table!  Our table ordered lots of food and grabbed many plates off the belt. 28 plates to be exact from the belt alone. I lost track of how much we ordered from the ipad.  We ended up splitting the bill at the end, and the  price comes out to about the price of an AYCE place. For some reason, they could not split the bill into 4 cards evenly. The amount kept getting messed up. No big deal though....we just had 1 person pay the whole tab lol.  They do have a bar in the front of the restaurant. I definitely see myself coming back for more sushi. My favorites would be the Toro, Blue fin tuna, Pork belly, and Orange salmon.",

Most of the rolls on here were 3 pieces and nigiri was 2 pieces or for some things 1 piece.  You could order other items such an udon and edemame from their touch screen menu.    You could also order full rolls or things like uni from the touch screen.  When you ordered these specialty items they came out on a little bus thing that was on top of the normal conveyor belt.  If it was for you the little truck would blink on your side.  If it was for the people across from you it would blink on their side.  As far as quality it was good.  Not the best I've had but not the worst.  The servers say there is a sensor on the belt to tell how long something has been there and they don't leave anything there for more than 30 minutes.  It was definitely busy but not crazy.  The servers were very attentive to refilling our waters and removing the lids from the plates we took off the conveyor belt.  The way they charge is they keep the plates you ate on the table.  You can see your bill for all items you ordered via the touch screen and drinks on the screen.    The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is they had some technological issues.  The major one which was quite an inconvenience to our dining experience was the touch screen went black.  The manager had to ask me to get out of my seat so he could go in with a tool and open it.  They apologized however it was quite an inconvenience.  Also the bus up top blinked at the wrong side of the table which can cause some issues with the tables getting the wrong tables sushi which has already been paid for.  Overall, a very good dining experience and I highly recommend to at least check it out!",

They've fixed the rice issue and everything was soooo good! I also found that the stuffed jalapeno popper was the bomb! I'll be back for sure! Service was also amazing as usual they strive here in that area.",

You get to choose your own selection and enjoy with minimum interaction with server. I liked the iPad you can also order non-sushi items and automatic machine delivers right to your table... fun, fun fun. This place is for an experience, and it attracts many tourists and local for those who never experienced conveyor belt sushi. Food? Quality of sushi is OK, do not expect a high quality. Every plates is $2.50, but size of sushi/roll is small. I also ordered ramen, cheese tonkatsu, spicy tuna maki, and shrimp tempura. They were decent - I don't recommend ramen though.  Would I return? Not sure. It was worth visit to experience conveyor belt sushi in Las Vegas, but I had better.... Sorry, I had a plenty of original/authentic conveyor belt experiences in Korea and Japan. Thank you for bringing this concept to Las Vegas though!",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night with a group of friends. We saw that it was a hot & new spot on Yelp so we wanted to go and experience this whole sushi on the conveyor belt thing. Our waitress was pretty friendly & provided good service. When we went it had only been open for about 1.5 weeks so she was fairly new to the whole experience also.  Basically any plate on the conveyor belt is $2.50 & you hang on to the plates towards the end so the waitress can keep track & count how many items you grabbed. There is an iPad on the table that's screwed on only at one end of the table. That was a major mistake because it was a total inconvenience for the ppl sitting at the opposite end. They couldn't see the menu on the screen & we would have to read out loud what was on the menu or they would have to stand up & lean over to look at the menu. We actually even ended up switching seats with each other so a couple of my friends could see the menu. Hopefully they figure out a new idea how to implement the iPad on the table without the inconvenience.  Anyway, whatever you ordered off the iPad came out on a robot type machine & it lights up on your side if it is your order, pretty cool. The menu has different foods & prices including udon noodles, sashimi, sushi rolls, etc. The appetizers were disappointing, I really wanted to love everything but unfortunately that wasn't the case. The branzino, shishito peppers, and pork belly was good. The clams (3 tiny, tiny pieces) tasted like it was just cooked in water, very disappointing because it cost $5 so definitely not worth it. The scallops were cold & I thought it would be thoroughly cooked, warm, & delicious but it was not. The soft shelled crabs are also very small & I wasn't feeling the flavor at all. My friend tried the oyster & she said it tasted like it came straight from the ocean and didn't know how she managed to swallow it. I felt like the appetizers were priced too high especially because they weren't that great. But the cooked sushi was good & I couldn't eat any raw sashimi or nigiri because I'm pregnant so I can't review those items. My friends did say they were delicious especially the blue fin tuna & toro, so I'll be back to try out the stuff I couldn't eat. I think at the end of the night we ended up with 28 plates, so average about $35-40 (6 of us) a person including tip, not too bad.",

Almost every plate I grabbed was either just a tiny bit cool or room temp.   The staff was pretty much non existent. The only times I saw our waiter was to get our initial drink order and when I had to ask for the check.  I have had way better sushi at AYCE places in town and had extremely way better sushi at traditional style places and the service to back it up.  When you pay per piece you would expect top quality fish but not here at all. I caution any of you that want to try this place, if it feels warm in the restaurant please dont eat here(I would like to save you from the horrible stomach pains I had later in the day and the horrible decision I made to eat here instead of my normal go to spots)",

The restaurant is definitely on the fancy side for a revolving sushi spot.  There were many more dishes to choose from besides your typical sushi, such as carpaccios, ramen, and appetizers. We sampled the yellowtail, super white tuna, unagi, bluefin tuna, toro, and salmon and found them all to be pretty fresh and tasty.   The only major negative was that all the nigiris were so small! The pieces of fish aren't that big and they only give you a tiny amount of rice. Usually i get full off 6 plates at a revolving sushi spot, but I was only half full here. I probably could've eaten more but didn't want to spend another $15 because then I should've just gone to an AYCE sushi spot instead for that price.   Overall this place would be a 3.5 for me, but I'll bump it up to a 4 due to the quality of the fish and the great customer service. Just expect to spend more than you normally would at other revolving sushi spots like Kula.",

The also have this really cool machine that when you order something that's not on the belt...it like delivers it straight to your table. It's like a little robot & once you grab your order you hit a little happy face button on the side & the little rover goes away into the kitchen! I know it sounds weird but it makes sense if you go & actually check it out for yourselves! I've never seen 9r experienced anything like it. All of the sushi tools I tried were delicious!

However, with the novelty of the conveyor belt I couldn't help but also grab stuff too. - When you specifically order something, a specialized cart gets shot to your table. Super cool! - The orange salmon was very very delicious. - Garlic edamame (Order it via the iPad, it's $1 more but made to order and a bigger portion) was yummy! - The service was great. I was really impressed with how our waitress was smiling and recommending dishes to us. I wish I caught the waitress' name because she definitely needs to be commended for being so friendly and nice to my family and I.  Overall, I can't wait to come back to eat there.

All the plates rotating around are $2.50, and most of the rolls were 3 pieces per plate and nigiri 2 pieces per plate.  I ordered the nigiri off the tablet so it would be made fresh, since some of the rolls we got off the belt were not very fresh. I think anytime you fry something and slap a plastic cover over it, it gets kind of chewy.   The fish seemed fresh from the orders off the tablet. If you know what you want, I would just order off the tablet and skip the belt.  I think the belt is just a novelty and it at least gives you a visual of what you are ordering.  We saw the rave reviews about the black garlic ramen, so we had to try it.  Surprisingly tasty for a sushi joint, the broth was pungent and the noodles were well cooked, but don't expect more than a sliver of meat.  Overall, I'd come back for a quick bite.",

The selection is pretty good and it's all you can eat but don't expect to see the typical \"slap yo mama roll\" and 50 \"sexy\" sushi combinations. Sushi plates revolve on a conveyor that is table side and a la carte items are ordered via tablet provided at each table, some orders come right to your table on the conveyor! Items like sashimi salads and filet mignon will make you forget about what you're used to at other all you can eat sushi places. Usually once we're seated and I cozy up to my first cup of hot tea and a bowl of miso soup, IT. IS. ON. I'll add a 5th star though when they can accommodate groups without a long wait. It's too hot to be waiting outside in Vegas. Prices vary on a la carte items but each small plate is 2.50. Don't look at my stack and I won't look at yours!

    "text": "Great new sushi concept in the Vegas valley! Very enjoyable second time trying sushi, but perhaps not the right place to go for your second time.   You walk in and are immediately greeted by several workers (I went in during lunch, right after they opened, around 12) but might change if they're busy or not. We sat down and was immediately awed with the great atmosphere and conveyor belt full with nigiri and other options. I'm personally not a fan of sushi based on my first time but I decided to jump the gun and try it once more. We started with the yellowtail tuna which was a tad fishy but what do I know? Then tuna, which I did not like at all. I decided that I couldn't eat anymore of the nigiri and opted for the more traditional rolled sushi. Sapporo has very interesting options, including: Popcorn Lobster Roll (deep fried lobster with eel sauce and chipotle mayo) and Tuna Tacos. I also tried the Black Garlic Ramen ($4.25), which was extremely flavorful and tasted beyond fresh.   All in all, a positive experience at Sapporo Revolving Sushi and my only complaint is that the \"request a server\" option on the iPad does not work and you're better off just waving them down.",

The booths are black leather contrasted with a glimmering white cloud ceiling and complimented with a brown marble floor! The restaurant is very exquisite and just immaculate when coupled with the food!   The food here is the BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK and the QUALITY DOESN'T FALTER. The food that is rotating around on the conveyer belt is just a measly $2.50!! However, let's say you don't want anything from the conveyer belt! Foods in the menu ranges only from $6 to $11. Furthermore, and most importantly, the fish is FRESH!   The staff were amazing as well! My water was refilled without me even knowing it was low. They always checked on my party and reassured that everything was perfect! Overall, this place is a must to visit!!! With all the things I just mentioned....this establishment will only concern you with a blissful experience!!!",

I feel like the concept and mass production of items greatly reduces the quality and flavor of the sushi. Sapporo's take on revolving sushi has thoroughly convinced me that you don't have to sacrifice on having both quality and convenience. I also give them mad props for being the first revolving sushi restaurant to break into Las Vegas' very competitive restaurant scene! If you're gonna do it, do it right and Sapporo most certainly does it right!  The wait was minimal for a party of three on a Friday night. Bonus, the bar features super affordable glasses of wine to help you pass the time. Do keep in mind that they will not seat you unless you have your entire party present.  From the toro to the popcorn lobster roll, offerings were fresh and plentiful. I never ran into any issues with an item I wanted being unavailable. To get full, expect to spend an amount comparable to an all-you-can eat sushi joint, around $25. There will definitely be a return visit during my next trip to Las Vegas!",

If you're not feeling what's on the conveyor belt, you can order specific entrees from their iPad menu, and a little robotic trolley will deliver the food right to your table! Each dish off of the conveyor belt is $2.50, and they range from edamame to nigiri sushi to special rolls.   The ambiance is nice and modern. All tables are booth style, and there are three conveyor belts. It looks like it gets pretty busy around the evening time.  You can come here for a snack or if you're really hungry, you can order a bunch of things and take a lot from the conveyor belt... but AYCE might be a better option if you're on the really hungry side!",

Honestly, I was initially feeling a little skeptical about their quality just because when it comes to \"revolving sushi\", most places fail at keeping their food on conveyor belt fresh. Also, being used to AYCE, I was feeling a little uneasy about the fact we had to pay for each plate we picked up. We actually ended up placing more orders than picking up sushi from the conveyor belt, since many rolls they had on were half rolls. We also placed orders on bluefin tuna and toro. To our surprise, they turned out to be one of the best ones we've had compared to most sushi restaurants here in Las Vegas. Most of their fish were fresh compared to AYCE as well. Service was also amazing, servers immediately cleared empty plates as we finished eating them. Wait time was not bad at all, we went there on Sunday, and we were seated right away. But I would recommend calling ahead to check on their wait time, because my friends have told me that they had to wait close to 30 minutes when they visited this place.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",

It's not AYCE but the plates are cheap ($2.50, $1.50 during happy hour). We got here close to happy hour and this place was PACKED. Thankfully we didn't wait too long, maybe 20 minutes tops. Came here with my boyfriend and we spent about $70 with 14 plates and a few items off their menu. Our waitress Wendy was very attentive and was super nice, never had to flag her down.   If there's anything I would clock them for is their cake. I ordered the strawberry shortcake and while I did like the overall flavor, the texture of the cake was dense and dry, possibly even stale. It was pretty tough to cut through with my fork. If it didn't come with cream, it'd be almost unappetizing.",

You MUST order the salmon belly and you'll thank me later. So buttery and good! Mmmm. I like that each plate is 2.50 so yo know how much you will pay. And with that, I was able to try garlic tuna, gyoza, salmon, salmon belly, a few sushi rolls, shrimp taco, tuna taco, etc. it was so so yummy. I recommend bringing someone who shares the same appetite as you that way you can try everything and not be unbuttoning your pants and split the bill. LOL.   The service is definitely slow tho. The servers (if they're even that since you grab your own food and a little machine cart brings you anything that you've ordered)/ bussers (because they more so just clear your table and occasionally fill up your water) take their time to do things. That or they have so many tables since their duties aren't that much since you pretty much grab your food. Idk. I wasn't too happy with our service.   But our food was bomb, the prices were bomb. I definitely want to try their happy hour prices some time!",

I hope they offer ways to give better value for locals in the future. I wish they'd offer a buy 7 plates get 1 free, or free drink or dessert on orders over $30 maybe.   This place is perfect for me because I love eating a variety of small dishes. My stomach is happy when I avoid the a.y.c.e. places where it's so easy to over stuff and feel bad afterwards. I left feeling like I could of ate more but was satisfied and happy to not be in pain.   Several of the items I didn't get a chance to try because they were not on the conveyor belt and I'd of had to order a full roll to try them. A lot of the rolls are not on the belt. You must order 5 pieces of shrimp tempura, nothing smaller. It would get cold by the time I ate 2 so I passed on those.   I had the owner/ manager walk back and forth past my table a 10x but never said hi or asked how I was. Not mad just something I suggest to the owner to do. The service is good though, employees were helpful and answered questions and kept the table clean and ice tea refilled.   I'd suggest to give them a try for sure. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Too many good reviews here on Yelp, so we tried but it was just a so so...  Their sushi pieces are so small! It's like they cut a whole roll into 10-12 pieces that is supposed to be sliced into 8 only. If a piece of regular sushi is 1 inch thick, here it's like 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick, the sushi's in the popcorn lobster was like this. We had a hard time using the chopstick because it was falling apart from being too skinny! Same thing with the diameter of their sushi it's so small!  2 star is for the customer service and the flavor/ taste of the food, it was good but I would rather spend my $$ somewhere else.   2nd pic - tamago, where's the rice? Hiding because it was so tiny, seaweed that wraps around is so skinny too, even the tamago itself, have to hold it to eat it because it would fall apart. (That is a kid hand).   You should try it and see it for yourself. Maybe after they read my review they would make improvements. Or probably we just came at a wrong day and the person assigned in the kitchen was not trained well in slicing/cutting the sushi .",

I recommend sending someone to write down their name on the list.   The service here was really good. Our waiter came to our table several times and gave us refills for our drinks.   The revolving sushi concept is really cool because it's really fun to pick out your food while you eat and stack your empty plates, almost like a game. There's also an iPad on the table so you can order more food, like ramen, that isn't on the conveyer belt.  To be honest, I didn't really expect good quality sushi because it was 11pm by the time we started eating, which meant the sushi was probably out all day. However, the restaurant was so packed that the chefs were constantly cutting new plates of fish.  I really enjoyed the salmon and my friends recommend the popcorn shrimp.   However, the toro was NOT worth it. You can just see that the piece wasn't from the belly area, and it tasted like regular tuna.   I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups that want a split check. We ended up waiting for almost an hour for our checks to come. But, we understood that waiters were new to doing a huge split check.",

    "text": "Cool concept with a good variety of sushi and sides. Very clean and everything was fresh and all employees were nice. Major con is how expensive it is and how time consuming it is. However, we will be back! :)  Pros: *Only a ten minute or so wait on a Friday night!  *Very clean *Cool high tech concept  *Nice employees  *Everything ordered on the iPad was made to order *Fresh ingredients *Everything on the belt was $2.50 so you could try some of the speciality rolls without committing to a larger portion size and higher price  Cons: * You have to click on every specialty roll to see what's in it..should have a sort by fish type feature on the iPad. *Time consuming dining experience *Pretty long wait time from placing and order to receiving it (BUT everything is made to order so that is nice)  *Expensive. $40 for one average person's fill of food.   Food:   California roll is good.  Spicy salmon was pretty damn spicy.  Rainbow roll was my fiance's favorite!  Popcorn lobster roll wasn't so good. The sweet sauce they cover it in is really off putting...unless you like your sushi sweet. The eel sauce isn't bad or good it's just strange.  Sexy Mama was pretty good too.   $2.75 for soft drinks with free refills",

I didn't find the selection here to my taste as it has a large number of rolls plus sushi tarted up with hot sauce and even cheese.  No uni or salmon roe anywhere.  Based on reviews, I started with the black garlic ramen.  While it's nice to have a small ramen dish as a starter, I disliked the fact that they add bean sprouts.  No crunch for me in ramen thank you.  I stuck to the \"normal\" nigiri sushi for the most part, and left full if not inspired.",

The only real detractors for us was the service--they really didn't check in on us and at the end of the night they charged us for two more plates than we got (took a picture to send to a family member who had been to the same location). I mentioned the error to our waitress and she insisted she was right and I didn't feel like arguing.  Would go again, the food was excellent and the sushi was delicious.",

You get to order straight from the kitchen with their tablet menu & those are hot & fresh. The black garlic ramen noodle was really good. The broth was creamy & buttery, the portion was perfect. The waiters will check up on you from time to time for refills etc despite the food being self serve so that's awesome. The store was clean and very modern.

It's cheap in my opinion because everything in the conveyor belt is $2.50! They have 2 piece nigiris and 3 piece rolls along with small appetizers going around in the belt and they're actually REALLY GOOD! They even have small tonkotsu ramen bowls with all the veggies and even chashu! It was only $4.50, same with the udon noodle soup bowls! You can order full rolls but I suggest you just grab three different kinds of the 3 piece rolls for $7.50 ($2.50 x 3) because that's cheaper than paying 10 dollars for an 8 piece roll of the same thing when you can have 9 pieces of assortment! Your table will also have an iPad so you can order food/drinks/dessert anytime!   This place is so good! Besides the food, the place is really clean and the ambiance is so nice and relaxing! All the servers are nice and attentive! Definitely one of my favorite sushi places now. My bill when I go with another friend always comes to less than what I pay for in AYCE! We're both full walking out the door all the time!",

    "text": "I was super excited to hear Vegas was finally getting a conveyor belt sushi joint & this place did not disappoint! I have to admit I did wait about a month or so before coming here for all the hype to die down. My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday around 7 pm and waited maybe around 20 minutes for a table, which isn't bad in my opinion. We were also easily able to find a parking spot right in front.   Once we were seated the host explained the concept to us. All of the conveyor items on the white plates are priced at $2.50 and there's also an iPad at the table to order specialty items which are different price ranges. The iPad orders arrive on a separate little cart which stops right at your table and lights up. We tried this with the Orange Salmon which was really cool.  During this visit we tried quite a few different things, but our overall favorites were the New Zealand salmon nigiri, the Garlic Tuna nigiri, and the Mexican roll. All of the fish was very fresh and the portion sizes were just right for trying multiple things.   We will definitely be back again soon. Awesome concept & great food!",

    "text": "What a terrific sushi spot!  Entering the restaurant it is apparent it is well kept and clean, super clean. We went during \"happy hour\", I'll explain in more detail.  We were ushered to our booth very quickly by a friendly, welcoming very nice sever and she then explained the process.  That's when I noticed the conveyor belt with plates of sushi scooting along on the conveyor.  She said, you just grab a plate off the conveyor, which has 2,3 or 4 cuts of various sushi items and keep the plates and then they count the plates when you ask for your check.  During regular times each plate is $2.50!  Very reasonable, and AND during happy hour they drop the price to $1.75 per plate!  Each table has an iPad menu, where you can see the ingredients of each item as well as order additional menus items not on the conveyor and a ROBOT will bring your selection on a rail which sits over top the conveyor, it will stop at your table and flash lights alerting you to the arrival of your menu selection.  Super.   Each sushi item is preceded by a paper tag in a plastic holder identifying which item is following.  I watched like a little kid as plates covered in clear plastic tops scooted by on the conveyor, reading the sign, then scrolling the menu to see what was in the roll. Seriously, child like glee as each plate cruised the conveyor waiting to be picked.  Being vegan, I watched, looking for veggie options, which on the conveyor there were two. That's kind of a bummer. But I picked them right away. I then scrolled the menu and found a black garlic ramen, which I ordered. It arrived via the server rather than the robot as it could potentially spill.  It looked terrific, though once it arrived I noticed the little piece of meat not identified on the menus list of ingredients, \"one pork\" the waitress said. Super bummer. But I removed it and I gave in and plunged my chopsticks into the bowl. It was wonderful and after I added siracha and wasabi it was unreal good. The flavor of the black garlic and the near al dente noodles were terrific. This isn't your packaged $.19 variety of ramen, this was really very good.  Bummer the pork wasn't identified and bummer they really didn't have an all veggie ramen but wow it was good. I then  ordered the avocado roll, rice, avocado and seaweed paper wrap.  The avocado was fresh and a beautiful green and with a slice of ginger, dipped in my siracha concoction (siracha, wasabi and soy sauce mixed up into a paste) it was super tasty.  The avocado roll arrived via the robot and when it arrived a computerized voice said please take your order, or something, to be honest when it arrived and started flashing it's lights I jumped and grinned ear to ear like a toddler seeing the gifts Santa brings at Xmas, so I'm not exactly sure what the robot was saying. Within the iPad menu you can call an attendant or order direct off of the iPad, though I didn't realize you could order drinks off the iPad.  But, once I pressed the call server button our server arrived really fast and I asked for another Sapporo for her and some more siracha and ginger for me and it took maybe a minute and she was back with the items even though the place was really busy, not an empty booth and we were there quite some time watching people come in order, eat and leave and be replaced with new diners. Our server came by multiple times during our visit, despite closing down the place, they never rushed and it wasn't irritating how often they checked on us. They did so with a bow and a simple oh good oh good and a giggle and would back away to check on another table.  Terrific. A manager/owner guy was observing the entire restaurant bouncing back and forth between the isles watching the staff and the conveyors.  There wasn't one time a blank space was on the conveyor.  Also, new sushi items would suddenly come across the conveyor offering a new item.  Great!  My companion had a few different items off the conveyor and each she said was terrific, each one I picked was quite good as well including the garlic edamame. Not salty and when dipped in my siracha concoction it really shined for me.   In conclusion, the place is super friendly and a cool place to hang out.  The booths are big and comfortable and the staff is very attentive but not overbearing or rushing, just the right amount of attentive. In fact we were the last ones to leave and they all, each of them wished us well, thanked us and invited us back with giant smiles.  I would like to see more plant based/vegan options but I'll most definitely go back.",

Being the visual eater that I am, I love the fact that I can see everything before I try it.   Great variety on the conveyor not to mention all the other items on the menu that I have yet to try. I'll have to come back again and check those out.   Honestly, there's just something about seeing your sushi moving along a conveyor belt that puts a smile on your face. Like a little assembly line of deliciousness.   Notable mention:  Staff is always very gracious and helpful.",

Dining out with 3 young kids is never easy but the staff made it extra special.  2) Coming from SF, I expected a wait. So when I called to inquire about the wait, I was surprised that there was no wait during prime time for dinner.  3)Best deep fried brussel sprouts ever. Seriously.  4) The price. I definitely cannot get these prices in SF.  5) The service. It was so good that I had to list it out twice. As a mother of young kids, I always bring smaller utensils for the kids. When I accidentally left the utensils to bussed, Pure actually washed it before handing it back to me. That alone deserves 5 stars!   My kids didn't want to leave without saying goodbye and hugging our wonderful waitress, Pure. Thank you Sapporo for one of our most memorable dining experiences in Vegas.",

We quickly got seated and the waiter was friendly and asked us if we had ever dined there before. He explained how it all worked - basically take what you want from the conveyor belt and order anything you don't see on the iPad and it will come out on a robot. If the light flashes towards your table, that is the signal to grab your food. We went to town, ate a bunch of sushi, ordered some miso soups (the waiters bring that out to you - I am assuming because of the spill risk) and got some hand rolls delivered by robot.   At the end of our meal, the waiter asked us if we needed to split checks (yes) and he quickly sorted it out without us having to do the math (woohoo). If you want tasty sushi, great service and a fun concept, definitely check it out!",

This was the best revolving sushi experience I've ever had and I'm not even lying, it was worth every penny. Every single fish was perfectly sized and tasted as fresh as it can be, from toro (oh my god they had toro for only $3 a piece), salmon, yellowtail, baby yellowtail, mackerel, etc. Every single piece of nigiri was amazing. Usually, the sushi that are on the revolving belt would taste old and stale and not as freshly made, but that was not the case at all for this restaurant. Every piece we ate off the belt compared to the orders brought out to us tasted exactly the same. The ramen was great too, it was perfectly sized and for only five dollars! You'd still have room for your sushi. The tiny tacos were great and they definitely did not skimp out on the unagi nigiris. The hand rolls were stuffed and the seaweed did not taste soggy at all therefore we knew they definitely brought them out as soon as they were made. This is a restaurant I would for sure visit again the next time I am in Vegas!",

Sometimes the staff can be a little rushed, it gets busy. We always order a ton of food and it never tops 60 bucks.  Like i said, the place is family friendly. The reality is that our kids really love this place. It's technologically fun for the kids, there's a revolving belt of sushi and a robot on rails that brings food to the table from the kitchen. Also you order off a tablet off the table.   The place is clean and the staff is very attentive. The kitchen is qiuck to dish out food after you order.   The prices are good, happy hour is really good. Love this place.",

Would have gotten better sushi at the grocery store!  This is a pic of the Mexican roll and the dragon roll.  For any of you that actually eat these rolls, this is not the norm for the filling.  Paid $11 for each of these in the pic and the filling consisted of imitation crab meat and dressing.  Will never order from here again!!  Save your money and your appetite for something more palatable!!",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to coming to this restaurant for quite some time as I was intrigued by their concept and eager to try new sushi items I never had the courage to try before. After trying Sapporo Revolving Sushi, I feel conveyor belt sushi is a brilliant concept, one I believe all sushi restaurants should adopt as a way to encourage guests to try new things in order to see exactly what sushi dishes are their favorites and reduce waste.   I mean, let's be honest here, we've all been to one of those \"all you can eat\" sushi restaurants where you end up ordering a sushi roll that wasn't what you were expecting and now you're forced to eat it or the establishment will charge you for wasting. Nothing sucks more than to be disappointed with your meal choice and to be forced to eat it anyway. Sapporo solves that problem completely.  Guests are either able to order from a wide touch screen menu at their table or simply just grab a plate from the conveyor belt as an ample variety of sushi items pass by them. Each plate from the conveyor belt will have two to three pieces of a particular sushi roll, such as the Mexican roll or the smoked salmon roll, which you can taste on the first round or, if you'd like, grab again the next time that item comes your way.   I tried a wide array of items including the sexy girl roll, yellow tail tacos, lobster roll, and even a white cake dessert! I simply loved having a variety of food items arriving to my table because there's nothing better than be able to sample great food over and over again.   Also, our server was fantastic. He made sure our drinks were refilled often and was able to provide great suggestions as to what menu items to order in between our indulging in the revolving sushi dishes. One of my friends who dined with us decided to try the filet mignon which was perfectly cooked and topped with a succulent sauce that left him yearning to order the dish a second time.   Definitely impressed with the great food and service Sapporo offers to their guests. I have no doubt that my next sushi craving will be satisfied at this fine establishment and I will continue to recommend it to all the sushi lovers I know!",

    "text": "We've heard nothing but good things about Sapporo and decided to finally give revolving sushi a try for ourselves. Japan always comes up with innovative ideas but conveyor sushi is just pure genius. It's super efficient, endless choices and WYSIWYG, small portions so you can try a bit of everything without waste, and best part is there's minimal human interaction required  We came in last night near midnight to take advantage of their sweet HH deal. There was a bit of a wait and more parties came in after we arrived. But that's to be expected because it was a Friday night  We got seated at a booth next to the kitchen and I was able to get a glimpse at all the action. What I saw was stacks of plates piled sky high and busy bee kitchen staff replenishing the conveyer belt with plate after plate. Reminds me of a factory in there!   I came for fish so I decided to start with nigiri. There's plenty of options for nigiri and they all looked fresh as it passed by on the belt. I picked out some of the more premium nigiri and enjoyed every one I tried. Wasn't a big fan of the rice though- a bit dry and fell apart easily. Also tried some of the rolls and loved how the ones with soft shell crab/shrimp tempura in them were still warm and crisp. My favorites of their specialty items included the mini shrimp tacos, popcorn lobster roll, and pepper tuna and smoked salmon nigiri  I recommend trying this place, especially from 10pm-close for their reverse HH- less people and amazing deals at 1.75 per plate for 2 piece nigiri and 3-4 piece rolls, discount drinks. Item selection seems limited during this time though. I wished to see some more non sushi items on the conveyor belt but never saw more than gyoza. If you're craving their other menu items, they're all available and you order straight from the screen at your table and it'll be delivered via conveyor belt on a musical platform",

Seating was very fast but the service and food was what changed my review of this place from a solid five stars to a sad two stars. Our server never checked up on us nor were we given plates. The conveyor belt was empty for the most part and no new dishes were being placed in, so it was the same food. The iPad for ordering specific dishes and requesting the bill was pretty pointless as it took 30 minutes and a reminder to the waiter that our soft shell crab still hasn't arrived. Place was not busy at all like they usually are and other customers seemed to be getting upset as well and leaving. When we finally got ahold of our server, the soft shell crab was sent to the wrong table twice. At this point my family and I were frustrated solely due to the lack of service and lack of food on the conveyor belt. For first timers, this would not be a good first impression for them. Long wait times, lack of variety on conveyor belt, and terrible service. I'm sorry Sapporo, but as it stands now, this is clearly unacceptable. I may return back in the future and I hope this place improves.",

    "text": "I am shocked at the 4 1/2 stars.  Maybe that is because I have had sushi on a conveyor belt before in Tokyo.   If this review was on presentation alone I would give it a 5, heck I might even push for a 6.  Unfortunately, I came here to eat sushi.  The way it works is that there is a constantly moving conveyor belt that has plates with a couple of pieces of sushi each.  Just take the plate you crave.  After dinner they count up each of these plates at $2.50 a piece.  For whole rolls, appetizers, and bigger dishes there is a computer screen.  These orders are prepared in the kitchen.  When they are ready a little robot that looks like it may be from Star Wars wheels down a track and stops at your table.  After repeatedly announcing your food is ready, it races back to the kitchen after you take your plate.  Unfortunately, for me the food did not stand up to the presentation.  I am not saying it was bad, it just wasn't sushi to me.  Everything is on the sweet side.  When I want sweets I go for ice cream.  That being said, I really loved the Strawberry roll.  It was really unique.  It tasted more like strawberry pie than sushi, but hey I love strawberry pie.  Go ahead and call me a hypocrite.  I do think this is the perfect place for a first time sushi patron or someone who is on the fence about trying sushi.  It felt like sushi with training wheels.  The only problem is, I already know how to ride the bike. After finishing dinner, I felt like going out for sushi.",

Who would've known that a simple addition to having a small R2D2 deliver your food straight from the kitchen to your table would be a hit. I love that you can order right from your table by using your self serve tablet and its very helpful that every menu options on the tablet shows photos of what you are going to order. Yes, I read pictures. I only read books with pictures anyways lol so they had already won me over lol! They do have servers roaming around to assist you/bus your table/take drink orders, so the interaction with an actual human is still present but is definitely not the highlight of this restaurant. As for pricing and quality, it's both there and it's very much affordable. They don't do ayce like most sushi restaurants in the area but that's ok. Overall, it's a great date spot, it's very clean and spacious but it can get busy quick and they always have a wait around dinner time so be prepared to be on the wait list for up to 30-45min. But I do highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a place to bring your sushi loving friends or maybe you're on a date! There's no way you can lose here.",

I understood it to be busy during regular hours, but it wasn't really busy around midnight. For someone who doesn't enjoy all the crowds of people on the strip, this might be the place to go for a decent meal where you could polish off decent sushi at a $1.50 per plate at happy hour. Normally they're $2.50. Not bad.   They have all the usual on the conveyor, and an iPad menu for all the regular stuff which is all very reasonably priced. Should you order something off the iPad, you get a cute little robot tray that comes to you and stops with your sushi and a friendly greeting. How fun, right?  It's a no brainer to come here before your big plans or early adventures, especially when its past 11pm because it won't be too bad. You can polish off all the sushi - rolls (popcorn - my favorite, tiger, garlic tuna, lobster, and more), nigiri (salmon, tuna, squid, octopus, striped bass, mackerel, yellow tail, sea bass), sashimi and lots of apps like gyoza.   Go nuts!",

The place is very spacious and seems more upscale then the Kula places. They have way more options revolving and you can order off the actual menu, which we did a few items. The fried brussel sprouts were very tastey. It had a citrus flavor drizzled over it that made the whole dish that much more satisfying to eat. The garlic  edemame had a kick to it that was super yummy. The garlic mini ramen, was the perfect amount if you also wanted to have ramen as well with your sushi. The broth and ingrediants were all so flavorful in a small bowl. It's a must try. The sushi that were revolving were all fresh and so many different varieties more so than most revolving sushi places.  This place is a must try but it's not close to the strip at all. You would have to drive here or get an uber. But it's close to chinatown and many other places to eat.",

    "text": "Went for the gimmick of the conveyer belt but must say I enjoyed myself and the food. Super clean and modern restaurant. Could definitely bring a date there. Sushi was good but no better or worse than any of the numerous AYCE places in town. $2.50 a plate sounds cheap but it adds up quickly. Didn't order any of the kitchen dishes but $10 a roll seemed standard via the iPad device for ordering Went around 7:30pm on a Sunday and seating was immediate but the place was far from empty. If they were slammed there's a bar you can sit at by the entrance so you can get lit while you wait for a table. Good spot if you don't want to wait for the chefs and you're ok with standard nigiri items. You can order sashimi from the kitchen but I didn't see any sashimirevolving  on the conveyer belt. Shout out to Japanese technology!",

We didn't make a reservation, and ended up waiting 30mins because they have a full restaurant.   While I was waiting in front of Sapporo, I was drawn by the beauty of the interiors, and decors accompany with functional technologies. The dining table tops, light fixtures, with revolving belt, and a cute tablet to place your order for efficiency is just perfect. I love the Modernism, casual,  fansy, and laid back atmosphere.  The price for all plates are reasonable, not too expensive. Some of the specialty dishes cost a bit more. The food taste pretty good, and customer service is on point. We got a free sample of Filet Mignon, I took a bite, and it just melted in my mouth. It was very Yummy!   I'm super satisfy with this resturant, I can't wait until I'm visiting again. I'll definitively stop by when I get home.",

    "text": "\"Kaitenzushi\" means, literally, \"revolving sushi.\" In Japan, they are ubiquitous. Cheap and fast, they're where one goes for a quick lunch or a late night snack. They're not known for fresh, quality fish, variety, or superb service. I learned about sushi when I lived in Japan, so I was a little dubious when \"kaitenzushi\" came to Las Vegas.  Sapporo surprised me! I chose it to have my birthday dinner, and I was not disappointed at all! It is nothing like the kaitenzushi-yas that are found on every shopping arcade in Japan. Sapporo is clean, for one thing. It's modern decor makes it seem more like a hot nightclub than a restaurant. Seating is mostly booths, and the tables are large enough to hold a large number of small plates without making one feel crowded.   The nigiri menu is comprehensive, with offerings that often can't be found at AYCE sushi bars or a la carte Japanese restaurants. They had Spanish mackerel on the menu, as well as surf clam, white tuna, toro (the fatty belly meat from a blue fin tuna), and snow crab. All of the items for offer on the conveyor belt are the same price - $2.50 - and instead of raising the price on the more expensive items, they decrease the amount. While most of the nigiri comes in two pieces, the more expensive items, like the snow crab, are only one piece. The fish was fresh; no fishy smell or off colored. One exception, oddly enough, was the shrimp, which was over cooked, dry, and a little rubbery. The sauce on the unagi was also bit too sweet for my taste, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The nigiri didn't have those huge slabs of seafood pressed on top of a tiny bit of rice that are so popular these days. Nigiri sushi is meant to be eaten in one bite, and Sapporo's nigiri is perfectly sized.  As I said, I learned sushi in Japan, where the innovative, beautifully made sushi rolls that one finds in America generally don't exist. So I tend not to order the crunchy tempura rolls, the spider rolls, or the volcano and tiger rolls. I didn't order any at Sapporo either, as they were much more expensive than the conveyor belt offerings, the most expensive were $10. But there were a good number of the rolls on the conveyor belt; mini rolls of just two or three pieces, that offered a taste of the rolls on the menu. There was also a decent appetizer menu, with items priced between $2.50 and $8. I didn't order any, but will be sure to try some of them on my next visit.  The turnover of the items on the conveyor belt was quick. I very rarely saw an item that made more than two go-rounds before customers selected it or it was removed and replaced. The conveyor belt itself was unobtrusive, adding to the clean ambience of the restaurant. An additional conveyor belt hovered over the main belt; if you ordered from the menu, by way of a tablet at the table, your order would arrive at your table on the overhead belt on a specially constructed cart. Very ingenious. I ordered a few items on the pad, just so I could check the delivery method. Everything I ordered came fairly quickly, nestled in its own little train car.  I also didn't order the noodles offered on the menu (three varieties of ramen and one udon bowl), because we were focusing on the sushi, but other customers were consuming them with obvious gusto. They were all priced at just under $5, a real bargain. The next time I dine here, I'm going to make sure to leave a little room for the black garlic ramen, which looked delicious!  So, if you're planning on picking up more than about ten plates per person, you might be better off, price-wise, going to an AYCE sushi bar. But the fresh fish, the novelty of the delivery system, and the modern decor all make this a great place to go for a light lunch, a late night snack, or a date! (Happy hour is from 10pm to closing, and all the belt items drop to $1.75, as well as discounted beer and sake!) Try it! I think you WILL like it! (And to the reviewer who said that the smoked salmon tasted like lox - DUH! What SHOULD smoked salmon taste like? And an FYI to that reviewer: You've probably never had REAL lox. The stuff you get at the supermarket is Nova, not lox, which is too salty for most American palates.)  Total price for our experience was $42.60. I tipped very little, as the servers tend largely to have nothing to do - they don't take your orders or deliver your food, or bus the tables. They are there mostly to deliver drinks and explain the whole system.",

    "text": "Bottom line first:  lots of surprisingly good sushi and rolls, but definitely pricy  We came for our first lunch stop for the weekend. Even though it was 1:30 for Black Friday, it was still pretty busy. We could have sat down right away to the set of booths with the broken conveyor belt, but  I decided to tough it out a little longer to have the real experience.   Despite being skeptical as lots of others, I felt there were plenty of good sushi from which to choose on the conveyor belts. Sexy Mama, red snapper, and seared Cajun albacore were the highlights. The small shrimp tacos were good too, but the portions were pretty small. We went through 20 plates between the four of us pretty quickly and ended up with a final count of 32.  At $2.50 a plate...well, you can do the math too.   It was a fun time, but with so many other value choices within the vicinity, I will probably frequent other establishments more often. But if you haven't had the conveyor belt experience, I wholly recommend this place.",

    "text": "I am giving Sapporo 2 stars because I rate a sushi restaurant based on the quality of the sushi, not its novelty of an old and tired concept of conveyor belt sushi that has been happening in Asia for more than twenty years.    If you're expecting fresh sushi, you're at the wrong place. The belt is way too long and you cannot beat the traditional cut-it-plate-it-bring-it-to-your-table sushi.  These sushi were prepared then a lid is put on top of a plate and it travels the length of the belt, which is pretty long and sometimes a couple times around.  If you're an avid sushi eater, you'll notice the fish is starting to dry up.  (Side note, revolving sushi restaurants in Asia are usually much smaller and are built like a bar.  The length of the belt surrounds the chef area and that's it.  You see the chef preparing the sushi and putting it on the belt.  And the patrons have a quick turnaround; you eat and you leave so the next person can come in, ensuring the turnaround of the sushi to be short and fresh.)  If you want to give this place a try for the novelty of it, then yes, it's definitely a fun and new idea for Las Vegas.  A great way to impress your non-Asian date, but I won't be coming back.",

The parking, while plentiful, is confusing because many of the spots located in front of the restaurant are designated for other businesses.  It wasn't busy, but we ended up parking at the bank next door.  When we entered the restaurant, there was a sign that said park anywhere.  That would've been helpful, say, in the actual lot where the cars are.  Just a thought. Strike 1.  There was a little bit of a wait, despite the restaurant being half full.  No biggie, but the hostess was not friendly at all.  Strike 2.  The food was just ok.  The selection on the belt was fairly limited and we saw many items go around multiple times over.  We ended up ordering from the menu, which is fine, but kinda defeats the purpose.  The fish tasted fine, but I wouldn't go so far as to say fresh.  Nothing was very memorable.  Strike 3.   You stack your plates and when you're ready to pay, they do a plate count.  I was not a huge fan of this, as I hated to see all the plates build up and not be cleared.

I always wondered if Vegas will eventually have one like it, and now it does! :]  My family and I have been wanting to come and try this place since it first opened up, but the few times that we had called to inquire about the wait times, it was a no go. Especially if you want to hit up this place on the weekends. So, we've put it off for a little. In the meantime, we have been faithful to our other go-to sushi joints lol  For our first visit, our group was told that the approximate wait time would be about 15 minutes. This held True as we were seated shortly after. Customer service was great and our table was constantly being checked up on to see if we needed anything else. But pretty much everything is done by yourself because all additional orders can be made on a personal tablet that is located on every table.  The restaurant's layout and design is modern yet simple. It has two sushi conveyor belts that past by all the tables, as well as two \"food monorails\" (as I call it lol) that deliver items that were ordered from the tablet. They run above the revolving sushi and will automatically stop at your table for you to grab. Awesome!  All the revolving food are covered with clear tops for visibility, but most importantly, to ensure freshness. That was my main concern for this place, as the food is constantly passing through tables.  To sum it all up, I had a really great dining experience and had fun handpicking and choosing everything. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake is good, as well as the matcha cake. This place is a must-try! Even if you're not in the area, don't hesitate to make the drive for it.",

No need to question freshness & quality of sushi. Items are all well labeled and visually appetizing AND equally delicious.  The popcorn lobster was great. There was sauce on every bite. They actually had budlight....lol.  Our server ANN Marie from Hawaii was entertaining and very friendly. She actually checked back on us constantly. She was genuine and very respectful. So... ask for Ann Marie as your server.   Thank you Sapporo Revolving Sushi for finally opening. I will be back....",

Nice ambiance and smart layout. There are touch screens at each booth to order from the menu. A robot brings it right to your table on the track. So fun! Items from the conveyor are fresh and replenished frequently. The tempura was piping hot with asparagus, sweet potatoes, and onions. Attentive service from Jeremy. I highly recommend a visit here to get away from the chaos on the strip.",

    "text": "Awesome and super affordable!!  I am so in love with this place. I can't believe Las Vegas finally has revolving/conveyor belt sushi!! This place is all around great. First off the food and prices are amazing! Every plate on the conveyor belt if $2.50, specialty rolls are $7 - 9, ramen is only $4, and drinks are $2 - 7. I thought the sushi was pretty high quality and definitely worth $2.50. The garlic edamame and black garlic ramen are insanely good! Seriously $4.00 ramen, you can't go wrong.  They also offer hand rolls, tempura and dessert. Make sure you look through the menu as they have nigiri not usually on the conveyor.  I really like how updated this place is. It's very sleek and clean. The staff are super friendly and are very efficient.   This place is a great option for those who don't want to explode from all you can sushi places and who don't want to go to a fancy overpriced sushi bar.   TIPS: Visit this place before their prices go up. It is super affordable for the quality and novelty.   Get there early. We arrived at 11:35am (5 minutes after they opened) and they were almost full.   Don't worry about parking. You can park anywhere in the lot even if the parking says its for a certain store (Hotai Furniture)   Order from the ipad menu, they have so much to offer. Plus, a little robot tray delivers your food to you.",

The atmosphere & dining area here was clean and very modern. Our server was Jeremy and he was attentive & checked up on us frequently. Since it was our first time here , he explained to us how everything worked w/ their iPad ordering system & conveyor belt. Their ordering system was user friendly. Everything on conveyor belt was 2.50$ which I appreciate that they kept it simple. Onto the menu items - the quality of the fish w/ their rolls is similar to what you can get at AYCE. What I HIGHLY recommend is their orange salmon (order it on their iPad). Their orange salmon was my absolute favorite , definitely worth the 7.95$. My boyfriend loved the cheese tonkatsu appetizer & spider handroll. I liked that their handrolls aren't stuffed with just all rice. The only menu item we didn't like that we ordered was the black garlic ramen. The broth had good flavor especially with the black garlic oil , but the noodles were way too overcooked. If the noodles weren't so soggy and had more than just one small pork slice then it would be good value for it's 4.25$ price.  Dinner was around $52 total for the two of us. So it's pretty much about the same price as doing AYCE & we left pretty full and satisfied. Could've just ordered like 6 or 7 of those orange salmon only and left happy too. Overall - decent quality & great service.",

Probably the best conveyor belt sushi I've ever had -- they have a main line of fresh, labeled dishes, and a tablet at each booth for special ordering from the menu, where items are either sent on a separate track directly to your table, or brought by a human server. Would definitely go back, and found the place originally via yelp.",

Our waitress was so good about refilling our water and bringing us soy sauce, ginger, wasabi or whatever we may have needed.....mostly water since we were so dehydrated from drinki....I mean the heat. For 2.50 a plate, you really can't beat the variety and quality of this place. They definitely make their money on volume, as the pieces of nigiri are on the small side. However, this allows consumers to get a huge variety of fish they may not normally eat. My favorites had to be the Sexy Mama roll, TORO (1PC), New Zealand Salmon, premium yellowtail and the bluefin tuna. They look like they have a pretty good late night happy hour as well. Definitely one of the better revolving sushi experiences I've had, especially in the states.",

First time to try such style of a restaurant was at Genki Sushi in Singapore and Hong Kong and now we have one here!   Did not disappoint!  Good amount of items on the menu from appetizers, sushi, drinks including spirits. Service was impeccable, manager made sure to spend time walking around to ensure proper service. Kitchen is visible and neat which is a plus when dining out.   For now, I'll give 5 stars.  Room for improvement? I would hope they can add more items to the menu. Less rolls and more nigiri options could be a good idea. On another note, could it be a possibility to create an AYCE option without sacrificing the current quality? A higher price point may be acceptable especially with this set up.   Look forward to returning soon.",

She loves sushi and since they don't have this kind of place back in Ohio, I figured this fit the bill. We went at about 2:30pm on a Wednesday so it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated right away and given a run down of how things worked. We ordered off the iPad and also chose items off the belt. I had the popcorn lobster and shrimp tacos. She got the Sapporo Special salmon roll and various other items off the belt. We split the Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and fresh. The service was great too, the ordered food came out quick. The servers were around whenever we needed them and were friendly. Price was great as well. Already planning on taking some other friends back for more of that yummy popcorn lobster!",

Their sweet shrimp is really good as well as their tonkatsu ramen.  The ramen is a fairly small bowl but the the broth is surprisingly good.  Glad to have found this place.",

    "text": "Sapporo Revolving Sushi is a very unique experience that distinguishes itself from the AYCE counterparts. The sushi is placed on a conveyor belt that is delivered to each table. The sushi is decent quality. I would definitely recommend trying their salmon belly nigiri, it was absolutely mouth watering. It was so tender that the salmon dissolved in my mouth. Just as a rule of thumb, avoid anything that contains cream cheese if you are interested in consuming a lot of fish. My friend and I made the mistake of ordering a cream cheese filled roll halfway through the meal and prevented us from ordering more food. Which could be considered a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. As a closing thought, I would recommend this place for people who want to try out something new!",

We ended up paying more than what we usually consume. Overall it was a good experience. The staff was good and attentive to our needs. Lastly they should add happy hour like $1 plates or something.",

She was way over the line but ofcourse I've maintained my composure like a human being and still left her 25% tip because I felt sorry for her. There is something unsettling demeanor about her. Perhaps misery.",

I wouldn't say its unfresh, just not the good stuff.  I enjoyed my time there, the only problem is the portions. Compared to sushi trains in California. I eat twice as many plates at Sapporro.  My only real complaint is the food portions. Each sushi is like half the width.",

This is important in any restaurant, especially when raw fish are involved  *Very tasty sushi. I was leery of the quality given that this is almost buffet style restaurant but it's actually quite good  *Half off happy hour at night! *Options like ramen and small plates for those looking to sample something other than sushi *Friendly staff *Low wait times if any  *Cool little robot trays that bring your food out when you order something from the kitchen  Cons: *Lack of variety. I wish they'd mix it up from time to time *Single occupant restroom  *Wait staff is friendly but never seems to freshen my beverage in a timely manner *Neighborhood is a little sketchy. Not that they can do much about this one",

I enjoyed the atmosphere, the decor was nice the restaurant was spacious and clean.  When it comes down to the quality of the sushi, I would say that the ingredients were fresh but the options fell short for my expectations. The rolls are pretty basic. I would have enjoyed this restaurant a little more if there were more extravagant/creative rolls. Most of the rolls tasted the same. Lacked flavor and sauces. Hopefully in the future they add more items on their menu. More variety.",
