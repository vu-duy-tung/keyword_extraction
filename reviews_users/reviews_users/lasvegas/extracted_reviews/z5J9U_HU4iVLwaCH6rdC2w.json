My mother LOVES this place and she is super funny about where she eats. I had the double waffle meal (I forget the name) with my waggles extra golden crispy as I like it. They hit it spot on and my waffle was the best waffle I've ever eaten!   The collard greens and those buttery cornbread muffins are great as well.   This is a must stop for you when you come to Vegas. We will be back in August and will stop by as always.",

The chicken and waffles was delicious. The portions was huge. I couldn't even finish it. They even gave us warm syrup which was a nice touch. The staff was friendly and always checked up on us. They had so many flavors of kool aid. However, they are one the sweeter side. I don't like things that are very sweet, it gives me a headache. I had to mix in water for me to be able to drink it. Overall, we had a good experience and will come back.",

As far as the restaurant itself the music was SUPER loud could even hear the people I was there with.",

Well we went and asked how again after 15 more minutes and a few people got seated and there was now magically 12 parties ahead of us. When I asked how could that be if my wife was just told eight? The hostess was very rude and snapped at me \"well you were quoted an hour, and you'll probably wait that full hour, you've only been waiting for 23 minutes.\" And I proceeded to tell her it wasn't a matter of how long we were waiting it was a matter of how four additional parties were ahead of me when I was just told there was eight. Well she didn't want to hear that and she kept telling me how we were going to have to wait the full hour. Well needless to say we left and went to Lou's diner on Decatur and were seated right away and got our order taken within 10 minutes. Why would I wait an hour for okay food when I can get seated immediately and get great food and great service?!",

No worries, I was still prepared to order and pick up two breakfast entrees. I ordered the banana Caramel pancakes. When I picked up the entree I found it was covered in pecans. Nowhere on the item description did it state that the dish came with nuts.  My friends order was the Lo-Lo's traditional French toast and his food was burnt.  All of this for $30 and to add to my annoyance; the receipt doesn't show anywhere what the items cost. Definitely won't be eating from this establishment again",

    "text": "This place is racist against white people.  And this theory does not count to those who bring a long an African-American person with them if they are white.  It only works if you're a white man standing there alone. Andrew. Commonsense is thrown  right out the window.  They started laughing at me when they found out I was waiting more than half an hour for food and one person called me a cracker. Too bad that any event like this would never make the news because it's a white person being discriminated against so I will just listed here and I'm sure that this listing will also get deleted somehow. But yes I am definitely stating that I felt completely discriminated against due to my skin color.  I came And after I had placed an order to go over the telephone and I was told at the front counter that it would just be a moment.  No one even acknowledged my existence after that except for pointing and laughing from the back near the kitchen.  I stood in one spot for half of an hour and when I did ask somebody how much longer it would be even though I had called the order in an hour ago she told me to wait one second and she would be right back with an answer and then I saw her serving tables. I was practically except for three others the only Caucasian male in this restaurant. I counted when I started realizing what was going on. I ended up telling them to never mind on my order and then I left due to embarrassment when I saw one African-American male literally point at me and said \"this cracker has been waiting where is his food.\" It's too bad no new station whatever pick this up but just be aware I experienced exactly what I said I have no reason to lie it was very very uncomfortable. If you want Greek food there's 1 million other restaurants around Lolos chicken and waffles. Lolo... What does that even mean? Is that in English word?  DONT EAT HERE!  *ANDREW S- you cross the line sir. Let me explain to you why. You may not get this or understand it but I will make sure that you do by the end of this. You just slandered my name. Defamation of character is the legal term/slanderous. Everything you have said that I said as far as me being violent and making threats and also that I am a racist is now in print by your hand. This makes you liable for slander/defamation of character. Not only are you liable but yelp is as well. Here's the best news. I am an attorney and this is my specialty defamation lawsuit. Andrew I hope you have some money because every Day that it remains in print labeling me as a racist for the public to see and also saying I should be banned from a store because I am a danger to others Is a horrible slander. This is an attorney this is what I do. Unfortunately you cannot change any of the text that I wrote to you not once did i say anywhere or eluded to Me being a racist. I'm not going to explain myself here but if you knew my personal life you would know that is not the case. Andrew you can report me all day long to yelp but I have a feeling that yelp will remove your post before they do mine. I found you on Facebook now I know you are so I will proceed with the lawsuit it does not cost me a dime and it will be good exercise for me in court I could use the practice usually everyone else at my firm does the work for me this time I'm taking it personally. In this day and age You need to be careful about what you say about people because it will in the end in fact come back to bite you. I don't want you to remove your post I want you to leave it up there where you say your slander and or defamation that I am a racist every day that goes by means more and more damages in the end. Damages just so you know is what is the most expensive part of a lawsuit. I have lost sleep over this I have not eaten since I read your post and I may have to seek therapy because of what you said about me. The longer you leave the post up the more money I will receive in the end this is a slamdunk deformation/slander lawsuit if you don't believe me call in attorney and ask but just make sure you give them the ACTUAL FACTS Before proceeding. Your childish behavior and actions including blocking me as well as your damaging words have impacted my life in many ways to this point. Next step is a subpoena it will be a certified letter sent to your door explaining exactly what I am suing you for.",

I notice that another reviewer experience the same issues were had so perhaps they are having a bad day. We waited 20-30 minutes for a waiter to take our drink orders and another 30 minutes to take our food orders, and still another 30 minutes to get our food. We ordered meals and most food was brought out a la carte and charged that way. To be fair, the waitress was really new and inexperienced. She didn't seem very familiar with the menu and a bit disorganized. I don't completely blame her. There was a lot of wait staff walking around but didn't seem to be aware of customers waiting. Didn't seem like a good team effort to help each other out. After we had finished eating, it also took us another 20-30 min wait to get our check. We were seated on the patio so we expected a little out-of-site, out-of-mind but we were there almost three hours. I have to say that the manager did come out and talk to us. He was very apologetic and offered us a free dessert.   Did I mention that the food was very good? It is what will bring me back. The chicken fried chicken was excellent, so was the catfish. The chicken of course was wonderful-cooked perfectly and I could eat a dozen prices of their cornbread.Having said all that. I will come back and give them another try and deserve a second chance. I am hopeful for a better experience next time. I even hope to have the same waitress. She was very sweet and I am sure she will get better with more experience.",

It was a little on the greasy side, maybe because of the bits of bacon in it? I also ordered a side of chicken. I was disappointed because the skin was overdone; however the meat was moist. I tried some of the waffles from my friend, but it was soft and soggy. With that said, they need to have those 2 items perfect if that's in the name of their restaurant. On the bright side, our waitress was very attentive and cheerful.",

Everything was made just right, the chicken had great flavor and the right crunch. The waffles still had a light crispiness to it when they brought it out ( I'm used to the waffles being soft even before I put syrup at the other places out here). And not only that, they had Kool aid!!!! So I had to go with the old school grape. And it was to perfection, Kool aid has a perfection you ask? Yes it does... Has to have the right amount of sugar... So I was totally satisfied with everything, especially the food, and so was family. Portion size was hefty too. Every Vegas visit will include a trip Lolo's!... Come to Cali please",

Group of eight, everyone ordered after ordering Marcos our waiter comes back and informs us that they have no pancakes for over a week!! A week is too long for a machine to be broken where you can't make pancakes at a restaurant. Then informed my mother in law they don't have any chicken strips ! Excuse me as a business you make a trip to the grocery store and buy some chicken strips to make. The my grand mother meal came out with no eggs; 15 minutes later eggs come out after asking for them several times. Also asked for butter several times and guess what no butter until the waffle was too cold to melt the damn butter. So many apologies from Marcos but never made anything right for us by just doing your job!! My husbands breakfast also comes out no eggs but we didn't even bother to ask about them at this point I was over it and so was the other people at my table. This may have been my last visit here.",

Side orders of grits and eggs never arrived until halfway through our meals.  We asked the waitress so my times over 30 minutes for our side orders she began giving us an attitude.  The service was horrible.  I've gone to one in Arizona and had no issues.  It's really unfortunate, it has so much potential.

I came in was greeted and sat in a timely matter, drinks, etc and let me add.....those gizzards and grits LORD JUST AMAZING! Well this time I had to knock off 2 stars but you guys did make one back up. I had friends from out of town in and we decided to take a trip to the famous gizzard place I had been raving on. 8 of us come in and was greeted by this pleasant young lady. Was told it would be a min while another young lady set the tables up, no problem it was quick. However just that quick she told us the table was there and that was it. Lol. No walking no showing no pointing. It went down hill from there. We sat there for a good 15 mins before a young lady asked us who was our waitress and if we was taken care of. Another 5 minutes for her to come back take drink orders and told well we're really busy so can you place your orders now. I felt like she was telling us put it in now since you all have been sitting for 25 mins or wait another hour. Anyways I waited so long for drinks that I couldn't take it any longer and asked for the manager. He was cool about the situation and did what he could I'm guessing. They asked us a million times afterwards was we ok but we still waited a while for our food to come out and it wasn't all together. Nevertheless, the lady who ditched us at the front apologized and we got free dessert and drinks! I will be back but maybe with a smaller crew so it won't be discouraging to the workers. Food is delicious however! Those greens and cornbread OMG! THE KOOLAID...OMG! THE FISH....OMG! Big/huge portions also! Oh the music is off the chain! Love it!",

Wait, 2o entrees slows the kitchen down so much you have to stop seating and then when you do ticket times are 45 minutes plus? I am just amazed. The topper was the visit from the manager and his complete lack of understanding as to what was happening and why. I am so disappointed because every time I have people in town this is a must for us.

Please do yourself a favor and do not open anymore. I can't even express in the right words how disappointed I am. The peach cobbler is sour and tastes fake!

    "text": "We went Lo-Lo's in Las Vegas and had an absolute terrible experience. My family and I entered the restaurant at the same exact time as a group of 4 guys. Both groups were seated.  We waited about 25 minutes and nobody stopped by to check on us, talk to us, take our orders, absolutely nothing. The bar had 1 person sitting there and the restaurant was half empty, not busy at all. The staff just continued to walk by and ignore my family.  I told my wife we should go, but she insisted we wait. 10 more minutes passed. She flagged down a waiter and he greeted us, but didn't take our order. My son was hungry started to become irritated, but still decided to wait another 15 minutes and was still ignored. We saw the group of guys that entered the restaurant along with us get served 4 plates of food and yet we haven't even been approached to put in an order. We were disgusted and with our son hungry and decided at that point it was time for us to leave. We wasted and waited 50 minutes to order food. Never in life, have I experienced such a poor customer service. This place lacks any type of consistency. The menu online states drinks are $6, but when you get to the restaurant they are quick to charge you $8!",

The fried chicken was very good, the other food was just ok at best. The Shrimp and Grits were a bit bland. The waffle was soggy and not hot. The fried green tomatoes came with our entree. Our food came and we had to ask for silverware and syrup and waited longer than we should have to get it. The staff is friendly but there is no sense of urgency. Service needs improvement, there is a lack of attention to details like the silverware and syrup. We might try it again, but we would only get chicken.",

    "text": "The food was great. I definitely can't take anything away from that. But the service sucked. We were seated fairly quickly, but our waitress didn't even realize we'd been seated in her section for 15 mins. and that was only because I asked another waitress to get our server for drinks. My daughters get there drinks and I didn't get mine till after my food was served. Not even a glass of water our server said she would get me. To top it all off, they took it upon themselves to serve my daughter waffles and wing instead of waffles and a breast because they ran low on breathe and had to cook more (8 more minutes to wait). My daughter was polite and said she would wait the 8 minutes and would watch out for her food. Hmmm. That didn't happen. Again she forgot about our table. It wasn't till the manager was walking around noticing myself and 1 daughter had food but weren't eating, and my other daughter had nothing did he go get her a fresh plate. We didn't even know he was the manager, he looked like the other waiters. Grant it they credited my daughter late plate, and some apologized for the poor service. But our waitress could have been sincere. She was too busy waiting on a larger party. Sucks for her cuz I tip based on service not just cuz it's the right thing to do. Maybe next time I'll just order food to go.",

    "text": "We arrived and place was busy but not overly crowded so I was a little surprised when I was told that there would be a ten to fifteen-minute wait for our party of six. We decided to wait because I was told the food was really good. After twenty minutes I asked the hostess why it was taking so long when other parties had come in after us and were already seated. She told me that they were waiting on a large booth to sit us in. I asked her why they couldn't just push two tables together and she said that the management doesn't like for them to do that because it confuses the wait staff. After another ten minutes we were taken to a small booth that was too small for all of us. I told her that we needed something else so she pushed two tables together for us and brought out our drinks. We waited another 25 minutes before I asked for a manager. The manager, Bobby Jean came to our table and I explained to her the situation about the table and how it had been an hour and ten minutes since we walked in the door and not one person had come to the table to see if we were ready - no one even acknowledged that we were there. She apologized and said she would get someone to wait on us right away.   Our waiter, Roy was very nice and apologetic. He took our order and made sure that we had refills when we needed them. The manager came up to check on us and to let us know that our order would be out shortly.  Once the order came out I have to say that everything was really good. I had the chicken fried steak and I have to admit I was a bit surprised that it was topped with a brown gravy rather than the more traditional white sausage gravy I'm used to having.  The first bite seemed a little spicy, but after that I was happy with the taste. I also had buttered corn and whipped potatoes. The one spoonful of buttered corn that I had was great - my three-year niece ended up taking the corn and eating it by the handfuls. The whipped potatoes tasted like they had sour cream and were just a little bit too salty for me, but I don't usually put extra salt on my food.   Once we got passed the fact that we had to wait so long to be seated and then had to wait even longer to be served, I would say the food was good. I don't know that I will be going back anytime soon just because of the wait and the fact that no one acknowledged us as we sat there. I will say that the manager Bobby Jean comped our meal so that was really great of her to do.",

    "text": "If I could leave less than one star I would. First let's give the back story. I'm from LA, Compton to be exact. So of course I had to see if it was better than Roscoes, let me save you the cliffhanger...it's NOT! Not even close. But I honestly didn't expect them to be. But I did expect them to be good and the service to be good. As I entered the establishment I jokingly issued the challenge to the entire staff that they \"better come with it\". I was greeted by the chef who I honesty thought was a Kevin Johnson look alike. I thought it was him but I wasn't sure. Yes the former Mayor of Sacramento, who's tenure ended with under age sexual misconduct allegations. The former NBA point guard of the Phoenix Suns. The University of California BERKLEY graduate. I mention all this because a man with his background and education, you would think he knew better than what happened.   First problem, was the culture misappropriation. Instead of the word drink they used \"drank\". I'm all for creating an authentic experience but don't play into stereotypes. Did I forget to mention the Kool-aid they serve ? Secondly, I ordered the the number 3 (3 pcs chicken and 2 waffles) with a large Tropical punch Kool aid and an Arnold Palmer. In addition we ordered the fried green tomatoes and Catfish (fried soft and they over cooked it) plate with eggs and grits. First bite was horrible! No flavor what so ever. I had to over saturate the food with salt. Also, the chicken tasted like it was fried in dirty grease. The kool aid was wayyyyyy too sweet but it's kool-aid, so what I could expect. The fried green tomatoes were bland. Everything is bland...no flavor! I've never been to a soul food establishment with no flavor.   I would love to say the food was the worst part. No, it gets worse! So the owner comes out and I thought it was Kevin Johnson but like I said I wasn't sure so I'm thinking it's the chef. First I ask for the manager. At this point I'm being slightly passive aggressive. I don't want to just come out and say how bad the food is. I just want what I didn't eat comped. Which in the food industry is a simple common practice. So KJ comes and asks what I think and I explained, he gets hella defensive! His words were \"you're one out of 200\" eluding to the fact they've had 200 guest and I'm the only who didn't like it. Ok, cool! That's fine, it happens. I told him maybe it was a bad day, again I'm met with defensiveness. \"Naw it's not a bad day, if it's one out of 200\" said Johnson. Again I'll take that and even said maybe it is me. Still trying to avoid the extras. As defensive as this dude was being I'm thinking no way that's Kevin Johnson. No way would a former mayor get into a verbal sparring session with a disgruntled customer. You would think a man who's worked with the people he would understand people better. If not that I know the NBA has media training.   Manger comes and I  explain to him the food is trash. He asks what I would like. I said I'll pay for what I ate. 2 mimosas, one drink , side of eggs, a waffle and fried green tomatoes. I took 10 mins explaining to him. The waitress, who by the way was excellent! She comes back with the bill at like 45-50 dollars but that's because it had the 2 meals that I did not eat on there. So I tell her that those shouldn't be on there because of yada yada. In all my years and locations of dining this is a simple fix. Comp those items and send them on about there day. However that's exactly what didn't happen. First the manager and then Johnson, comes over. They're both saying how they'll take off one but not both. My response is no, you're going to take off both because I didn't eat either one kuz they were both garbage! Seriously, the food was the worst! This when it goes way left. Johnson, said I'm call the cops. Call them! The nerve to try to intimidate me with law enforcement when I haven't done anything wrong. How dare him as a black man try to bring the law into this, when cops are shooting first asking questions last. My heart start pounding! I'm with my lady and 8 month year old son. I don't want to deal with the extras but it's principle.   At this point we're waiting  20 mins because I want to pay for what we ate. I'm not trying to get over and didn't want to just leave because I would've been stealing. So the smart brotha comes over.Let me say he's the best part of the story. He came and diffused the situation. HE GETS IT! Whoever he is he needs to be in charge. Kevin Johnson should be a silent partner! Back to the smart brotha.... LET ME APPLAUD HIM AGAIN!!! I explain to him and he's fair. So he said how much do u think you should leave on the table, I felt 20$ was fair because that's how much we ate. I left the waitress a 10$ tip and that was it . DONT EVER EAT here! It's nasty and the owner who I now know is Kevin Johnson is the worst!!",

The chicken was breaded in sand (that's how it felt on my tongue), the waffles were too soft (almost like a pancake), they burned the grits so they ended up tasting like cigarette ashes, the eggs were okay, the burger wasn't memorable, the red velvets pancakes were okay, the macaroni and cheese was good, and the platter we had with fried tomatoes, fries green beans, and catch was the best thing we ate.   The service was so bad. They forgot about our table after seating us and we had to ask a random server to take our order. Anything we needed to be done had to be directly asked for.

Here's the complaint.....As the server took my order she asked if I wanted a drink,  I ordered a water and a melon mojito....25 minutes later still no drink.  We finally flagged her down and she says \"Oh! I meant to tell you we were out of those\". At the same time,  the one of the people behind me was coming back from the bar with her drink.  Apparently she had been waiting for 30 minutes and just decided to go get her own.  So here I arm waiting for my food 30 minutes later with water instead of the drink I wanted..Oh well.  The food is AMAZING though,  so there's that.",

    "text": "Heard so many good things about this place and it was such a let down!! Arrived at Lo-Lo's around 1pm and was automatically told that the wait time would be approx. 1hr and 45min wait... since we heard awesome things about this place, we (party of 3) decided to wait that time. We were not seated until after 2 hours. Once seated, it took maybe 10 min to get a waiter to get our drinks ordered, another 10 min to get our drinks on the table. At that point, we were ready to order since we used the 2 hour wait to look through the menu. So we placed our order and no joke, it took 45 minutes to get actual food to us. When the food was received, it was sooooo cold and the waffles were soggy. We were so fed up with the wait time that if we were to send the food back, we would just wait there forever so we just kept it. We did address the wait times/food quality with the server and all she said was that 'Lo-Lo's is very popular and the kitchen was working as fast as possible but there are so many people that they try to do their best'. At this point, we decided to get the bill and get out of there... even after bringing up legit issues with our order/quality of food with the waiter, there was no 'oh here's free drinks (non-alcoholic) for the inconvenience', nothing. We ended up paying $70 for a meal that was nasty. I would of enjoyed the McDonalds food from across the way more than Lo-Lo's. Staff was very apologetic for all the let downs during our visit but I feel like nothing is being done to fix all the issues, that's the reason for this review!!  Visit Lo-Lo's at your own risk... I would suggest not to though!!",

    "text": "Very very good chicken and waffles. Reminded me slightly of Roscoes, the chicken tasted good and the waffles are similar. But the waffles and butter are still a bit better at roscoes, they're fluffier. The service was good, took us like 5 to 7 minutes just to get seated, even thought it was really slow. Tons of open tables, the lady in the front was busy with another customers order or something. Took us about 20 or so minutes to get our food. Our server was the bartender, she was sweet.   The OJ and sweet tea are absolutely delicious. This place has amazing prices and the food is quite good. This place is super similar to roscoes, so if that's what your craving in the vegas area, come.  I also tried their peach cobbler and was really disappointed... Best part of it normally is the crust but their peach cobbler is more like peaches and a spongy bread.. it was really generic.. Frozen cobbler from the store tasted   Update:   Came to have breakfast today and don't think well ever come back here again. Everything was just terrible. The host, young Mexican girl had no idea what she was doing. Had people waiting extra long even though there were multiple tables already cleaned and ready to go. The service was worse. Since we waited so long for a table we looked at the menu and already knew what we wanted. So exactly when we sat down we ordered our food. We got our drinks and waited 30 + minutes for our food. Our server stopped by after 30 minutes and finally said she'll check on our food.   You can tell the whole staff was pretty disorganized and it didn't seem like any of them were properly trained in hospitality and a fast paced restaurant probably being this place is only busy really on the weekends. The runners that were running food were constantly taking food to the wrong tables, didn't know where items were going. It seemed like there were only 2 or 3 servers working and the service was bad. We were never checked on to see how we're doing, if we needed anything... one server that was a different section asked if we were doing ok but that's about it.   We were honestly about to get up and just leave. We noticed a couple tables next to us were getting frustrated as well. Two tables near us waited 30+ minutes as well for their food as well. And then a table that got sat 15 minutes after us got their food before us.. which was crazy cause we ordered simple stuff, chicken and waffle and catfish basket (which wasn't good btw) and fries (the seasoning was good on them.) We asked for sauces twice, she forgot the first time. And she forgot to bring our hot sauce altogether so we just stole one from another table.   They should really invest some time into training their staff. Not only will their staff make more money for the restaurant but for themselves as well for learning better service. Our server only visited our table 3 times, greet, 1 check up 30 minutes later and the check. She got a $3 tip. If she checked up on us more often and put some effort into trying to get our food out in a timely manner. It would've been a different story.",

Being from the Midwest, I have yet to find a place in Vegas with Soul Food that will keep me coming back. Today (4/27) was a complete waste of my time and the guy manager who was on duty could completely care less. I was told by him that waiting an hour for 4 wings and two waffles was acceptable. In what world!? He probably was already tired due to the many complaints being thrown his way. The server had 3 tables  complaining about her lack of service. This place is poorly managed and not properly staffed. While waiting the hour I observed numerous dirty booths not being cleaned while the wait list kept growing. Where is this place sense of urgency?? Could probably have repeat business if they actually cared. I would give no stars if I could as I left before I could even get my food. You shouldn't have to wait more than 30 mins for food even if the restaurant is at capacity. What a shame and waste!",

There were some big and small pieces all over the plate. This dish was also plain and lacked flavors. The chicken and waffles were also average. The only decent part was the juiciness of the chicken, bur it was still not worth it.  They also offer breakfast all day, which per the menu pictures looked really good.

    "text": "I give this restaurant a \"ZERO\". I just walked out of this restaurant due to the unprofessional General Manager (GM). I simple requested the music be turned down slightly to the Hostess. When it didn't happen. I sought out the GM. I now know why the GM didn't even bother to come to our table to acknowledge my request. My customer service experience rating is HORRIBLE. The restaurant had the music blasting like it was a club! The restaurant only had guests dining/seated around the parameter booths, no where near a capacity to have the music at this level.  We did observe the wait staff dancing by the kitchen, so one can only feel it's not about your customer experience. Aside from lacking the basic skill set to listen to a customer and effectively resolve anything, the GM went so far as to throw his hand in the air, in front of me and walk away. I requested he turn around to let him know his behavior \" unprofessional\".  I strongly suggest you hire a GM who will represent your brand and provide quality service. What an example this GM is setting for your team members! There was even a \"trainee\". The Hostess was great! Not only was GM rude, when I ask to be provided with information to file complaint, he did not want to provide a resource. He stated \"I'm the GM\" repeatedly to me, like this was to be intimidating. He is serous? His arrogance of his title of being GM was quite evident as well as his lack of training.   I really love supporting black owned businesses, but Lo-Lo's you need to step up your customer service! As for my dining party, we left and came to Call Me Cake Soul Food. The service and food is AMAZING!",

My boyfriend and I met up with our friends here (a total of 7 of us) and honestly, the only thing that's making me want to not come back is the wait. I mean, I get it it's pretty new so all the hype is there and all, but when other bigger parties are coming in after you and getting seated before you, that's ridiculous.  We got there at 7pm and finished at 11pm. My friends and I had waited an hour or two to actually get a table, then we were able to order our drinks and food right away, and we waited another hour or so just to get our food. And while we were waiting for our food, other people who had been there a shorter time than us were complaining that they hadn't received their food. The workers there are okay and this experience wouldn't have been worth it if it weren't for our server, Joanne? She made sure we were okay and had told us that things were crazy in the back (which it was pretty insane considering our table had been moved inside and close to the kitchen).  I just feel like this place could have so much potential if everyone knew what was going on. Some of the hostesses were getting frustrated at how busy it got and I'm sure I wasn't the only one who could tell. It seemed like some of the servers didn't know what was going on in the back and the kitchen staff just seemed all over the place. I'll probably come back when things tone down a little.",

The apps are all good, and different choices than other places. Salmon croquettes so close to Mom's! Fish fried right, rice well-cooked, seasonings on point & all comes out hot.

Finally came, no apology for the wait, very nice, sorta clueless though, after bringing delicious piping hot food she did check on us several times. Dont expect greasy fried chicken at all, its good and hot and crispy but couldnt figure it out...I kept getting a taste and sift of fish as though it was fried in old re-cycled fish oil. That sorta bugged me, but I was starving...Large pieces of chicken, but how they fry it without it coming out greasy is beyond me...good gravy, good greens, great cocktails.    I shall return and will just have to be patient waiting on a waitress.  Dont.I repeat Dont go on a Sunday. Packed before and after Church crowd....No parking spaces at all.....It probably wont last here in Vegas, it was totally empty on a tues. eve From 7pm till closing.   cant stay open long if you are not bringing in the customers. waiting for a waitress to come and greet you when there are only 4 folks in the restaurant though is unnacceptable.....my family went the week of June 26th.

I decided to take my sister today it was a bout a 20-25 minute wait so we decided to just sit at the bar, the bartender BRADLEY quickly asked us what we wanted to drink and if we wanted menus. After he provided me with my drink he forgot my sisters but we did get a chance to put in a order, it took about 45-50 for us to get our food and my sisters drink. During the wait I tried to get BRADLEYS attention. I want to say I felt a bit discriminated against, due to the fact that the person sitting right by me was getting all the attention every 5 minutes but we weren't asked if we needed anything or how we were. When he brought out our food he wouldn't really acknowledged us or he seemed like we were bothering him, even for the bill it took some time we got there at 124p we ended up leaving at 257p.",

Visited 2-23-17 on a not so busy Thursday night. Arrived at 5:15 to have dinner. Ordered an appetizer and drinks. Koolaid was perfect, drinks perfect. The problem you ask? Getting our food was horrendous!!! After placing our 3 entree orders we didn't see it for 45 mins. Told the waitress it was cold( butter wasn't even melting on the waffle!) and to have it sent back. Only got 2 entrees and didn't see the third one. Appetizer still hasn't come out before our dinner showed up cold. The waitress we had was amazing and said she would take care of it. Grabbed our meals with the manager standing right behind her not even apologizing or showing concern. Just glanced our way and bolted the other direction! Told the waitress we still haven't gotten our app yet. 5 mins later appetizer comes out piping hot and yummy. 15 mins roll by and we get our 2 entrees, still COLDER THAN YOUR EXS HEART for the second time. Mind you we still haven't even seen the third entree. The place wasn't busy as much as they usually are and still super cold food. My first visit here was amazing but it was jam packed, crowded but they still got our drinks, appetizer and entrees for a table of 8 in about 20-30 mins. We asked to speak with the manager and to our surprise gave us a \"what the hell do you want me to do about it\" kind of attitude. The waitress, that was yelling at her staff to get theirselves together, had more \"managing\" experience/attitude than that person who had a red manager shirt. WAITRESS WAS VERY UNDER-APPRECIATED! I wish I could of caught her name. Willing to try this place again and hopefully we can have piping hot chicken and waffles this time!",

But this time, right after New Years, the place was EXTREMELY slow and understaffed.  Maybe three or four people working outside the kitchen and none were being very timely. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a seat (seats were open but took forever to be cleared from previous guests), and then a full hour for our food. The food was great except for a salad, which was supposed to have avocados on it. First try, there's no avocados. Second try, the avocados are rotten. Third and final try, the waitress brought us a few not great slices and said \"Those are the best ones we got.\" So obviously at this point, we're pretty irritated but we have our food and we're not going to complain and cause a scene. We eat, it's great. Happy people. Then comes the bill. On the menu, it specifies which meals come with ranch or whatever. Some of us got those meals. Our waitress charged us a DOLLAR for each tiny cup of ranch, and we're talking about a cup that is in inch deep and an inch wide. She also brought us multiple refills of said ranch multiple times without our asking, so seeing that was definitely a surprise. At the end of the day.. I don't know if I'll be returning anytime soon. Truly do love the food, but this was NOT a pleasant experience at all.",

MAKE SURE you order the cornbread, the okra and the fried green tomatoes! All of the chicken is PERFECT and the grits are stupid good. I could go on and on and on......JUST QUIT READING THIS AND GO EAT THERE!!!! The only requirement is that you LOVE True southern food!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings. I've been twice this month for chicken & waffles  - the waffles are soooo good. The chicken isn't bad, but it's not great, and it's not consistent. The first time the fried chicken was bland and a little over cooked. My second visit, it was cooked to perfection and had slightly more flavor. One of my guests had a soul food dinner and loved the mac & cheese, green beans and cornbread muffin.  One of my guests received his food, his biscuits and gravy were cold while the rest of the food was hot, and one of his items was missing and he waited nearly 15 minutes for it.  This morning my sister ate her leftover omelet which included fried chicken and she discovered two chicken bones, one she bit into while eating.  I really like the atmosphere, and I'm sure once they are well-staffed the service will get better, but I'm on the fence about visiting again.",

The breakfast selections are priced at around 12 to 15 dollars, however lurking amidst these selections is a five dollar special from 7 to 11am only.  Great price for two eggs, three strips of bacon, grits and a home made biscuit or toast.  I added an order of home fries that were a lot like potatoes O'brian and were really good.  Water served with a lemon slice in a mason glass.  Good coffee too.  Service was fast and professional.    The only downside for me was the ample use of butter and that might be a plus for you.  The grits had a huge scoop of butter. The toast was absolutely drenched in butter.  My advice would be to ask for all butter on the side if you don't have your cardiologist on speed dial.  None of this stuff will ever pass for healthy food, but it tasted good.",

So I was very disappointed when I finally went there and experience that me and my friend Annah had. I was the first one there and the hostess seated me and I did not get greeted by my server until after my friend showed up mind you she was about 5 maybe 7 minutes behind me which was not a bad thing but to be there for that long and realize that you don't get greeted by your server and they don't even offer you water is a little bit troubling. She finally did greet us af 5 -10 mins of my friend getting there. She brought us waters and gave us time to order. And this happened a lot she give it time to order and it felt like she disappeared came back took her order got it wrong and then disappeared again came back brought our food disappeared again she never asked us if if you're enjoying your mail if we liked everything or anything like that till the end of our meal she forgot her sweet tea and then we we acknowledge that hey go ahead and bring us the bill cuz we have to go and you didn't bring us our sweet tea she never apologized for it or anything she just gave us our check and left again so I paid her the cash and left her a very bad tip and usually I'm not a bad Tipper but I felt like I heard service was so poor and she didn't care and it's not like Lolo's is really busy it was just frustrating. This whole situation doesn't even describe the food the only good thing about Lolo's is there chicken I thought it was a very very good I don't understand why their grades aren't smooth they are kind of like a just a hockey puck they were just hard on their eggs were over scrambled the potatoes were fried but they were like dry and then the fish had more batter on it than fish itself. I will never go back again! And the toast was dry old cold toast. So cold that the butter didn't melt...was so upset and dissappointed....never again",

Did I mention the eggs come with cheese and onions . Prices are very reasonable .... We had a wonderful waitress who was very friendly and interacting with my kids. We. Were a party of 9 and were seated right away. The kool aid was great .. This place deserved the 5 stars.. Will definitely come back again when visiting  Las Vegas . Atmosphere is great . They have Tv and also play good music . This place is 10x better then roscoes chicken and waffles",

Perfect texture crunch and flavor ! Will definitely go back for the chicken,also my friends ordered the Mac and cheese and complained that it tasted identical to velveeta mac and cheese, all in all the food was good but not great , i would say for the most part they have phenomenal drinks but the overall service is rather poor,",

The greens were tender with just the right amount of kick. The chicken had been fried in dirty grease and was really greasy. I ordered my waffle with no butter but it came with it anyway. I scraped it off into a napkin and the waiter took it with him. No offer to get me a new waffle without the butter in the middle, but okay. The waffle was okay. It was flat and soggy. The only flavor it had was cinnamon and was not crispy at all. Not even on the edges. The tea was actually really good. It wasn't overly sweet.   My son ordered the country fried steak meal with Mac n cheese, collard greens and a sweet tea. The gravy was not the typical country and wasn't very good. The country fried steak was tough, greasy and bland. The corn bread muffin looked good but we didn't try it because it had a HUGE dollop of butter on top that made it mushy and unappealing.   The Koolaid on tap is cool if you're 6. I doubt we'll be returning.",

It took about 20 minutes for the order come in.  Oddly enough, we were the first to order and the last to get our food.  And by the way, we had to remind our server of our order in order to get it.    When I got my food, I started eating and apparently, she forgot my eggs.    Long story short, there were many things wrong with the service.  No sorry for the delay or anything, all we got was that it was busy.  However the server right next to us appeared to take care of her guests.  I will come back for take out, but not for dine-in.  She does not deserve a penny.",

The bartender, that couldn't serve drinks by the way because they didn't have their liquor license yet, did nothing but disappear and flirt with these 2 girls the entire time.  After we sat down, we were ignored for about 10 minutes. The bar was sticky with syrup residue and previous customer's dishes. The menus were falling apart and there was over an hour wait time. He then took our order. The food arrived in a decent amount of time and wasn't too bad. A little on the pricey side for certain things, but not terrible. The waiter that brought us the food had to go and get silverware and our drinks because the bartender who took our order never brought us those items. There was no syrup for the waffles and after asking the bartender for syrup twice, we finally walked over to another area of the bar and asked the girls if they were done with the syrup and could we have it. A few minutes later, the bartender came back and brought the girls, who were completely done eating, 2 bottles of syrup. He still, did not engage us.   When the girls left, he left the bar and ran outside of the restaurant and talked to the girls for a few more minutes outside before coming back in the restaurant.   We weren't the only ones who received this crappy of service. I watched patron after patron trying to get the attention of their server and being ignored.  If the staff was focused more on their customers instead of flirting or just standing around, they would have more happy customers. Plus, I watched a few servers improperly disposed of food which is a health code violation.  I will never go back.",

No one had an attitude as a matter of fact they insisted that we stay. Our food came out nice and hot, chicken was juicy and well seasoned, waffles were light and fluffy. My niece received a free jumbo size Koolaid because her order took a little longer than everyone else. Our waiter \"Sparks\" was exceptional and came by to refill our drinks and checked to see if we needed anything. If they were bad in the past that is no longer the case.

(The first time I gave them a pass) waiting to be seated they 'accidentally ' seated 3  groups of people prior to us. Then once we were seated we did not get a server for over 15 minutes at which point I stood up and went to the counter to get water.  The waitress then proceeded to bring me water but no one else at the table. 8-10 minutes later we finally get a waitress attention to bring the rest of the table water and a menus.   NEVER GOT THAT.  10 minutes later and I request a manager. Been at the location for 30 minutes at this point. Manner gets there and things move on quickly and efficiently go l from there.  Then we done eating we sit (I am timing at this point) 11 minutes before I flag a waitress down and ask for to go boxes for the food we want to take. She brings back ONE (1) to go box for me.  At this point the whole table is getting agitated. But remain calm.  So 4 trips later and the proper amount of to go boxes and bags we are ready for the bill. We sit for 11 minutes and then I finally I start trying flag a hostess down. Finally a waitress comes to the table directly next to ours. After she completed with that table I said excuse me (my voice is deep and was was loud enough for other people to turn around.) She stopped but DID NOT turn around.  Then my mother said excuse me again...the watreess stopped looked directly at us. Looked back at the papers in her hand and proceeded to walk away. Then the table behind said wow! So once again I went to get the manager. When he gets to me the first thing he said was \"Wow! Your still here!?\" He apologized profusely, comped the meal. We left an my mother said she would never come back here again and we have been coming here since they first opened. Attrocious service except for the manager. This was the worst service I have EVER had anywhere. The food and the Manager were the ONLY saving grace.",

After 4 separate visits, this eatery is not having an adjustment period, it's failing to reach the basic mark of tasty food.   The one bright spot here is the service is excellent. The servers are attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, that's not enough to overcome the bland taste of the food.",

However, for some reason this place completely changed my perspective. We regret recommending to eat here. We waited for 45 minutes to get our food served and by that time our appetite was gone. Then, when our food was served, the order was wrong and incomplete! On top of that, people who arrived and ordered after us got there food served first and we didn't even order that much food. Plus, we also had to keep asking and reminding our server for our extra sides. Our waitress barely checked on us and management could've cared less. We definitely received a bad service over all. For that reason I highly do not recommend for anyone to eat here and believe me when I say I am not coming back to eat at this place.",

The second time around when I ordered the lil'sis they took out all vegetables. Served me a sausage omelet with a crap ton of cheese it was a hot mess. Completely ruined my meal. And the service here is horrible it's just only 4 tables filled at 3pm on a Monday and our server , Chevy , vanished for the entire meal ! Did not check on us once to see if the food was correct. Had to have a different server take the dish back after 20 mins of sitting here waiting of course. Service is bad and food isn't the best , go to M&M soul food ! They are so much better !!",

I have tried this place several times and the last was the worst. It always has taken the staff a long time to greet you, the food wait is the longest. Expect at least 35 to 45 min for food to arrive. Drink that first drink very slow, it took my refill 20 minutes after the server forgot it. My wife asked to talk to the manager, which took him 25 minutes to talk to us. As all this was going on, not once did our server say sorry for the wait. I worked in the food service industry for 16 years, I know that there is no reason that the place did not know how long ticket times are. It felt like every employee in the place did not care what was got g on around them. The place was not busy and maybe at 25 percent capacity when we ate there. Me and my h wife have never said we will not go back to any place, until now.",

You expect \"your people\" to except inferior services just to patronize your establishment.  HELL NO!!! Money is money and GREAT customer service goes a long way. So NO lolo (with the lowercase letters) I will not return and I wouldn't recommend this ghetto ass establishment to anyone..

Took 35 mins for a table of 4 which is pretty good. I could see the kitchen thrashing hard to get the food out. Fresh fried chicken takes at least 20 + min to fry. When you got a full house there's tickets in front of your order so learn how to wait . Go to Popeyes if you want your heat lamp fried chicken in 10 min. The waffles are laced heavy with cinnamon and it made that sweet & savory flavor pop. So if you want plain boring waffles go to IHOP. Collard greens were delicious , potatoes smothered in gravy were great! Corn bread muffin was huge, buttery. Mac and cheese just tasted like melted velveeta mixed with mac, really thick and rich. Hot link was old school dry and chewy. They shouldn't have served it to us .They got super sweet Kool-Aid on tap. Really love the fried chicken and will try other sides next visit.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this: Lo-Lo's is so damn good, the food is great and there's no question about it. The real problem is the service.  Recently my girlfriend and I had probably the worst service experience that was so bad we lost our appetite completely. We got seated around 8:06, someone took our order, and that was it. 3 different groups came in after us, a party of 6, a family of 4, and a group of 4 women. They all ordered and got their food while we're still waiting for ours.   After awhile I got my waffles but my girlfriend didn't get her chicken, so because we waited half an hour already, we shared my plate of waffles until she got her food, which didn't happen until after the closing time. The family was already finished and ready to go, and the party of 6 were packing up as well, it's already past 9, the restaurant is closed and my girlfriend still did not get her food.  The worst part of all this was that we were seating in the middle of the restaurant, servers were walking past us for a whole hour, and not a single one checked on us, not one time. It took the manager to help us get our food as well as our check, but even then none of the servers were checking on us. But you know you did? The Bus-Boy, yes, the Bus-Boy was asking if we needed anything and checked on us.   We were the last of 3 tables to leave, and we were only 2 people. We waited so long that they turn off the music and was cleaning up the restaurant. No matter how much I love their food this was a terrible experience that turned us off from eating here for a long time.   Let me make this clear, it's not just the fact that the food took over an hour to come, it's the fact that every... single... server treated us like we were invisible and did not check on us once.",

I think I thought it was more of a fast food restaurant. To my surprise, it's really beautiful inside. It's got a really cool farmhouse meets industrial feel & the place was packed...on a random Wednesday night. The hostess was so nice and our Server Jazzie was AWESOME!! She was really friendly, fun and really seemed to enjoy her job. Can't wait to go back again for red velvet pancakes. So glad we finally tried this place.",

My guests had shrimp and grits, pancakes topped with banana and pecans and chicken and waffles.  EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS.  Came out hot and fresh. Our server Jazzy Jaz was the  best and we loved the owner.  I must say, the 20 min wait for food was well worth it. My fave was the catfish, if you want sweet, you can't go wrong with the pancakes. They played old school RnB and it made the general atmosphere that much better.  I highly recommend this spot and will surely be back!",

The vibes were so dope, atmosphere was chill. There was gospel music playing as it was Sunday and I was groovin. I got my kool aid and was not too impressed, now I got grape which is my personal fav. Now they tropical punch will make you wanna fight for the last drop! It's that damn good. So I got the chicken fried chicken with white gravy, Mac & cheese, grits with cheese, and cornbread. Yes I was trying to feed all the THICKNESS & that I DID! Now this food was amazing, I was trying to keep looking like a lady but lord knows I wanted to eat like a damn bear! It was so flavorful, the chicken was juicy but the gravy gave it the perfect hit. The Grits were perfectly seasoned, the cheese and butter sopped up together just touched my spirit. Then this cheese Mac & cheese deserved to be at EVERY cookout, holiday, repass, wedding, baby shower, and bridal shower. It was hella cheesy, warm, and seasoned well! Now the cornbread was hot, had a dollop of butter and fell apart when I tried to eat it, NOW THATS MY TYPE! ** in my sawtee voice**. Truly y'all I loved Lolos and can't wait to come back and at again. I ate my leftovers once I made it back to Cali and it was still bomb ass hell!",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I hate to have to ever say this but I felt they were prejudice!  When we arrived we were not greeted. We had to stare at the staff of about 5 at the front of the restaurant. Finally after awkwardly standing there we were acknowledged only to be told there as a 30 minute wait. If we wanted we could only sit at the bar. So at this point we were puzzled because there was a whole section of tables open. They said those were reserved because they were expecting a group of 100 people to show up. We asked everyone at the front desk about the empty table by the bar that was being cleaned for just the 2 of us. So finally they reluctantly agreed.   We finally seated ourselves and it took 10 mins before the waitress came over and I told my friend I was about ready to leave which I think they wanted us to do.   Meanwhile... we got seated and I was waiting around 10 mins before the server actually showed up. Nobody came to see if we wanted drinks to start. When the waitress who took her time.... finally arrived she took our food and drink order. She arrived with the drinks only, of which I had to go to the bar and get more ice and also let her know the food hadn't come yet. She was like \"oh let me check\", like as if whatever! So after another 30 minutes or so the food miraculously arrived. She could care less and just ran the bar, she had forgotten she actually had tables to wait.   The food was not worth the wait! Every item was super salty you couldn't even taste the food. Over $60.00 later and I will never return! Oh and the music is so loud you can't even hear the person sitting across from you. Did I go to a club????   I noticed on the way out of the establishment that our waitress was very different with the other table she was waiting on. She acted like she actually gave a shit!   Save your money and go to a real restaurant!",

We were seated promptly, and served by Bree.  From first contact, to the \"good-bye, come back again\" everything was superb.  The catfish was a highlight, and the greens were better than my Grandma's (please forgive me).  We had the fried green tomato appetizer and it was amazing (it comes with thousand island dressing....just press \"I believe\" and try it).  Everything is made to order, so I wouldn't suggest this place if you are in a hurry, but having said that, I LOVE their food!  Well worth the wait!",

But we were surprised today, we thought we were crazy but we just didn't understand why all of a sudden the service was above and beyond, until the new owner came and talked to us like family and we told him it's like oiling a new machinery, we couldn't believe how on point all the staff were!

While I prefer the ambiance, cleanliness and size of the Vegas location, the Phoenix location and Scottsdale location absolutely has better service. We arrived (party of 2) at LoLos 11:20am on a Monday. Was seated right away as there was no line. Order was taken right in about 10 minutes after arrival. However, we waited over an hour without any food. We were informed by our server at the 45 minute mark that our food would be another 10 minutes as they were low on chicken (which is beyond me since that's what they are known for). We asked the hostesses to speak to the manager at the hour mark, as 10 minutes had passed. No manager came over. The restaurant was not packed, as there were empty tables around us, even though there was now a line forming at the door. We ended up leaving at 12:40pm. Beyond disappointed. We have family who lives here and this was just unacceptable.",

I ordered the waffle with a breast and a side a grits. The waffle was just ok and so were the grits. At first when I saw other plates coming out, I thought the chicken looked like it was going to be fried too hard for my liking but to my surprise the looks were deceiving. The chicken was seasoned well and tasted like something I would eat at home.  The service was a little too slow for me; however the servers were nice and professional about it.  Overall I would definitely return here again. This place is giving Roscoe's a run for their money so if they ever come to LA, I'll support it.",

My personal experience was excellent.   Everyone on the staff anticipated our needs and it gets no better than that!! The hostess was sweet and offered a high chair for my son and gave a coloring sheet with crayons. She also asked what seating was best given that I had a child with me (on the way out she came from behind the podium to open the door). Our server was GREAT her name was Chevy and she was awesome from the minute we sat down. She offered an extra plate, extra butter, a kids cup and a drink to go. She even apologized for the wait of the food which did take a while even though it didn't seem like they were too busy.   The only notable minor issue was that a leg that came with my chicken and waffles was under cooked and quickly another server noticed as she walked by. She grabbed a manager who was kind, complementary, and apologetic and immediately brought a new one. Easy peasy!   I had at least 7 different people ask if I needed anything, tell me my son was cute or offer some sort of assistance. I was even watching tv and someone thought it was a cry for help lol That sort of service is why I tipped 50%.  As far as the food, it was good. The leg was meaty and not overly breaded, the breast was juicy (go ahead and smirk) and the thigh was cooked nicely as well. The waffles were thin yet flavorful and quite delish! A few bites kinda tasted like fried pork skins though which was odd but not worthy of a complaint.   This place is on the opposite end of town for me but I had to run some errands and I'm really glad we stopped in. We will be back!!",

    "text": "Ate breakfast at LoLos this morning with my wife. Not knowing if we would like the food we ordered one chicken and waffle platter. Came with 3 pieces of chicken and two big waffles. Food was good and one meal was plenty for two people. Butter and syrup accompanied the meal and service was great by a waitress memes Chevy. Place is bright and clean with booths, tables and a full bar.  They are in the old Tony Roma's location and have been open about 3 months. Soul food is the specialty of the house and chicken and waffles are the main entree. Breakfast is served all day. We will return to try dinner soon. Always nice to be pleasantly surprised when you try a new place.",

I wish they already had their liquor license because I probably would have ordered a drink while my hubby sat in the car with our kids because it was so packed. They said they were supposed to get their liquor license the following week.  Anyhow, it's great to have another option on the Northwest side of town.   Update: A couple of weeks later, less busy but still no liquor license.  Chicken was better the first time too.",

Shrimp and Grits..shrimp good...not great, grits bland.  Waffle sandwich...bland.  biscuits and gravy were overwhelmingly large and more biscuit then anything else.  Service slow since person was covering bar and waiting tables, yet many standing at door. If you are looking for lots of food,this is the place.  If you are looking for lots of food that taste as good as it looks, go elsewhere.",

I server was very uninterested in his job but was pretty attentive when my boyfriend got a cracked jar of water. I ended up ordering the 2 chicken leg 1 waffle plate with a side of grits and my dude ordered the 3 piece chicken and 2 waffle plate. It took quite awhile for our food to come out (30-40 minutes) but when it did it was hot and the chicken was juicy but it also lacked flavor. The waffles didn't taste like much until you drowned it in syrup and the grits were pretty bland as well. I wouldn't choose to come back but i would tag along if someone was dying to try this place.",

Nothing to combat the dry stringiness of overcooked chicken. I finished about half of it before guiltily throwing it away.  But the banana pudding? I could happily eat it every day for the rest of my life.",

I was with a party of 4 and we were immediately greeted and seated, our waitress came by after 5 minutes and asked for our drinks, we already knew what we wanted so we asked if we can place our orders while as we ordered drinks. She took our order and everything was fine. Until we had to wait for 45 minutes for our food. We didn't order that much especially since two of our party were just sharing a plate. I was able to notice people come in after us and received their food before we even got a refill on drinks. We barely saw our waitress she came by at most 4 times during our 2 hours here. Now I know that if it's busy it'll be a longer wait time for our food but it was almost completely empty in there. By the time we got our food it was honestly dry as can be, our waitress even mentioned that our food was being cooked fresh. They completely forgot items we ordered. I was hoping that lolos would be the vegas roscoes but as the concept is there the delivery was at best mediocre.",

The waffle had a decent flavor but I was expecting more. I didn't realize that when I asked for fresh lemonade, I was getting kool-aid but if that's your thing then you would have liked it  I was excited to try this place because I read asked article attempting to compare it to Roscoe's. Big mistake. Nothing like Roscoe's so don't get your hopes up too high. Overall decent meal, ok service, ok flavor so a 3 overall.",

There wete 4 of us and the food came all at different times , 2 of us got food then 2 of us just sat there. shrimp and grits was horrible in my opinion , chicken breast was ok , waffle was not memorable and they put cinnamon in their syrup ?? im not a cinnamon fan would just have appreciated a plain version , but our waitress was nowhere to be found so I couldnt even ask her if they had that. The chicken wings are not the chicken wings youre thinking of so fyi, my daughter got a burger said it was ok , just ok ?? im sorry if im spending $100 on a meal for 4 it better be better than just ok . wish we would have went somewhere else but at least but now we know",

The Mac & cheese and their rice and beans were tasty. I have already recommended this location to a friend and will continue to suggest this restaurant. I will be back soon.",

The customer service has always been A-Plus and everyone is so nice They also have alcoholic drinks, a bar, and music and or the TV on. The atmosphere is nice and pleasant and you could always go there for games and big parties. They have an outside patio with mist to cool off with too. You could purchase shirts, mason jars, and hot  sauce!!! I totally love this place. Outside is nice, clean, and inviting. I will forever be a fan of this place!!

A friendly hostess, waitress and busser made our experience really pleasurable.  We got Windy as our waitress.  Ask for her!  I had the breast and thigh and they were GREAT!  Juicy and just fell off the bone.   The waffle was equally as delicious.  I usually don't scarf meals down, but I crushed this one.  The atmosphere is very open. Has that cafeteria feel, so of that isn't your thing, ask for a booth or the bar.  All in all, I enjoyed it!  It is obvious that the place just opened, but there is a ton of potential here.",

We waited 30 minutes for our table and then proceeded to wait for an additional 25 minutes before a sever even bother to acknowledge our table. When she did, she did NOT introduce herself and then did not ask us if we were all on the same check but told us we were all going to be on the same check and that she was only going to take orders from one of us so we needed to decide who the boss was. Her attitude was nasty and she was just rude. At that point we ordered our drinks, appitizers and meals all at the same time. They turned the music up so much that I  could not even hold a conversation without yelling, it wasn't that loud when we walked in. Another 35 minutes passed before we ended up walking out. In those 35 minutes NOTHING was brought out. Not our drinks or appitizers, they didnt even bother to pick up the menus from our table (not that that is an issue or anything, I'm just trying to show how ignored we were.) They weren't even that busy. We wasted our time and ruined my son's 12 birthday dinner and our night. I emailed to complain and apparently they ignore emails too as I have yet to receive a response. This is the worst experience at I restaurant I have ever had and we will never go back.",

My husband had to get a coat out if the car.  The dish names were over the top.  I ate \"Betty's boob\".  Oh, and they make a killer Arnold Palmer.  I would come back... Eventually.",

The waffles are soft and a bit undercooked for my liking but when it's covered in butter and syrup it doesn't really matter. The sides were pretty good but if you're coming here, you come for the chicken (and sweet tea)!!",

I went on a Sunday morning around 11, and although it was full and busy, it wasn't noisy and we didn't feel rushed at all. Everyone that we came in contact with was very nice and accommodating. The waiters were very upbeat and efficient. The service was very speedy and accurate.  Now, to the food. I am really a fan of the waffles. They were prepared just right, vey moist and flavorful. I could go every week just for the waffles. The grits were also perfect, drowning in butter just like I like, and perfectly seasoned. The tea was also perfect. However, the fried chicken was over cooked and dry! I'm hoping it was just a bad day, so I'm willing to try going there again. There are so many things on the menu that I want to try - the catfish, the mac & cheese in particular. I'll write an update if the chicken is better next time because I reeaaaly would like to see this restaurant stay in my neighborhood!",

    "text": "I've eaten her abt 3 times but only dined in once. Customer service isn't bad but always just below substandard.  Employees appears to not be fully trained. Almost seems like they're unsure of themselves or overwhelmed... even when not busy. One young black male, maybe early to mid 20s. Worked the front counter and you could tell he was confident & knowledgable. He was pleasant & actually explained what a particular dish was.  The one time I dined in, the waitress kept forgetting small things ie biscuit, to refill our water, etc. When she handed us our check, she actually stood at our table to wait for us to sign the check. I was there w/a old friend that was here from out of town so we were chatting away. We looked up and I reminded the waitress again that we needed togo containers. It was extremely awards & a lil embarrassing that two 43yo women were treated as if we were going to dine & dash.  Food is good. I'm in love w/the shrimp & grits so it's pretty much all that I've ever ordered. I think my friend ordered a meat dish (sorry, can't remember which one) but she enjoyed it.  What prompted me to write this review is bc Sunday, I called to see if they will be accepting reservations for Father's Day (requested by my son). The business was open but no one answered so the message asked to leave a message. I left a full message w/my ques, name & return tel# but didn't get a call back. Called again on Mon. A young lady answer & when I asked the ques her response was, \"the manager is busy, can u call back?\" Now, how in the heck & I supposed to know when the mgr isn't busy? o_@ Again, staff seems new to the restaurant/customer service business so I jus asked if she could take my name & number then call back w/a response. That was abt 2pm on Monday. It's now Tue and I honestly don't believe I'll get a response.  I love supporting black own businesses bc if we don't, who will but I will not sacrifice my dining experience w/subpar customer service. They've been open long enough to hav things running smoothly now.  Customer services gets 1 star. Food gets 3 stars.",

We went on a Tuesday early afternoon when we knew it wasn't going to be busy. (We know how Lolo's can get regardless of location) we were seated fairly fast. But seemed like the hostess was confused even though they weren't busy. She just assumed we wanted to sit inside, so without asking us she proceeded to lead us to a table and we quickly interrupted her to tell her we rather sit outside. Which for some reason seemed to delay her progress and halted her thought process. She then tried to re-group or whatever but it took her too long to determine where we could sit outside even though only two parties were out there already. So anyways we got seated and then we were greeted shortly afterwards for our drink orders. We got the drinks in less than 5 minutes. We ordered our food and the food came out in only about 15 minutes.  They have their alcoholic drinks on the menu but don't have the license yet. That was a bummer. We should have been told that once we were seated; just as an FYI so we could have been prepared to order from the \"available\" drinks.  The food here is GREAT! Made from scratch home cooking that is always consistent!! (I frequent Lolo's in Phoenix and Scottsdale when ever I'm in AZ and the Vegas Lolo's seems to be just as good) I ordered my usual: \"Nay Nay's\" (Two waffles, two eggs with a cup of grits then I add hot links on the side). I LOVE their waffles! The flavor is like no other and it's their staple recipe! DON'T ever change them! She got the chicken and waffles. The piece of chicken came out very over cooked. It should have never left the kitchen or even be served. But they are new so they still may be learning...idk. But no biggie because we never have a problem telling them to take it back. She then chose to get catfish which was delicious! Fried to perfection.  Overall there were some great things and then some things that weren't so great. They obviously need to tighten up their service when it comes to the hostess being unprepared, notifying us about what's not available from the menu and not serving over cooked food. I blame the waitress because she should be our advocate and let the kitchen know she wasn't going to serve food that is not up to the regular standards. But they all are new so that is something that can obviously be fixed easily and takes a little time. The food is great! Portions are great. And in a great atmosphere. And that trumps the small service issues they had so I am giving a solid 4 stars until I come back.",

I want to start by saying that Sparky was amazing and gave great service!!! I really enjoyed the waffles It was soft and cinnamon-y. The chicken was hot and juicy and definitely get a side of honey hot sauce ( it's xtra) Oreo pancakes were good and the bacon perfectly cooked. We also ordered chicken tenders and a waffle that too was good. They have extremely large drink portions (kool-Aid) on tap lol but that watermelon was so good! We ended with banana pudding it's $7 but serves like 4 people and comes in a mason jar. I never really had it let me say I KNOW IT WAS HOMEMADE so delicious. All in all a great breakfast spot and finally a something similar to my hometown fav Roscoes!",

    "text": "This place is absolutely the worst to begin with when the hostess sat us asked what we wanted to drink said water to begin with and never saw him again! About 10 minutes later a server don't know his name came to the table didn't introduce himself asked if someone got our drinks we said not sure host asked  but never brought them said what do you want to order to eat said I'm not sure yet and walked away with attitude and eye rolling! Came back eventually with the water and  I asked if I could order a lemonade since it was homemade and he walked a way abruptly again with attitude like I was putting him out!  By this point I was done with the putting him out attitude and went to the bartender to ask if a manager could be sent to the table debating if we should just leave and go to m&m soul food which there service and food blows this place out of the water! In the meantime a different food server came to try to get our food order but really hadn't decided to stay or go yet and then the manager eventually shows up With lots of excuses like her server the one with the attitude acting like anything I asked or said without putting him out with his rolling eyes and walking away that he must have been upset because he didn't really want to be there and he was working later than he was supposed to my response was then cut them from the floor it's bad for your business for a customer not to feel welcome in an establishment that you have  been sitting in  for approximately a half hour is unacceptable in my book... in the meantime after her making tons of excuses and what not she offered to bring some fried green tomatoes to the table and switched servers still felt quite uncomfortable in there this was approximately 6 o'clock on a Sunday night and I guess supposedly they close at 6 o'clock according to the manager said one of the hostesses just sent a customer away saying that we close in 10 minutes we also heard another server at a table behind us tell customers they couldn't order anything to go which I thought again with strange since food was still coming out the impression is very lazy service in there and you are constantly having to flag people down to try to get their attention when they come to the table they come off as if there you're doing you a favor or that you're just simply putting them out! The food took a long time to come out when it was brought to the table one of the chicken breast we noticed looked like it was very old and dry and it was totally different from the other pieces and sure enough after cutting into it was exactly what we thought dry and like it had been sitting there all day under a heat lamp asked if they would remake that piece of chicken again got attitude and was told it would take 5 to 8 minutes.... well it literally took them  a half an hour! Lastly at 6 o'clock you can hear the entire kitchen staff so loud you could hear per Batum their conversations as they act like they're having a party one talking louder than the next while we were sitting very far from the kitchen Side of the restaurant actually and yet that's all you could hear the employees acting as if they didn't have any cares in the world it  very disrespectful and very unpleasant to listen to.... followed up by blaring loud music again so that the employees can have a great time still four or five tables in the restaurant and they're blasting people out it was so uncomfortable I had asked for them to turn the music down as it was giving me a headache!!! My recommendation is avoid this place like the plague the food is nothing to write home about and the service is ridiculous these people act like they're beneath serving anybody shame on them and coming from being a former food server  I certainly wasn't working for the minimum wage I was getting paid for they need customer service skills taught  to them badly and management The general manager actually seem to be intimidated by the workers and out of control of the entire restaurant all she did was make excuses one after the other!!! Go to m&m soul  food you will not be disappointed they originated in East LA they are as nice as pie when you come in and can't do enough to give you good service and great food with a smile on their face",

Outstanding chicken and waffles (hubby's favorite) and the soul food combo (I love chicken and catfish, although they have about 8 choices of different proteins), which offers 2 of maybe 20 sides has given me a chance to try a bunch and all of them are YUM!  Tonight, hubby went with Lolo's, which is 3 pieces of fried chicken (OMG! the skin and batter is awesome and my sister says the way it is cooked that it should be served as an appetizer before getting the chicken and waffles!) and two perfect waffles.  Yeah, a lot of chain restaurants have started serving chicken and waffles, but blah!  These truly rival Roscoe's in Long Beach, which WERE the best anywhere...move over Roscoe!  I got a combo with 3 pieces of chicken (mixed and matched the way you want, so I got 3 thighs) a waffle, cornbread and eggs with onion and cheese...delish!  We are now coming at least once a week...can't drive by without wanting to stop.  You got to try it.  Highly recommend!",

Despite mixed yelp reviews I had my sights set on patronizing this business on my next trip. We went on a Monday night. The hostess was friendly asked if we wanted waters but said she'd send the server over. No water.  The menu was expansive with many amusing entree names so it took a while to decide what we wanted but when we finally did we waited only for the server to come back and say they were out of several of the items and then came back and said they were out of an additional item.  It was most annoying and a server should already know what's out before they take your order. What's most irritating is that even though we shared it was our first time there and that we have been looking forward to coming they were so unapologetic about being out of items.  The manager never came over and they didn't offer any compensation. Since they kept coming back to food came out separately instead of at the same time. Just really trifling over all. They don't have to worry about me coming back.",

I love love the Kool Aid on Tap,  I am currently pregnant, and that is one of my cravings.  Okay now on to the food.   I got two pieces of Chicken, A breast, and a wing with a waffle.  Let's start off with the waffle.  It was a little soft and soggy, but it actually taste pretty good.  It had a cinnamon flavor.  The chicken was crispy,  and juicy.  The batter was a little thick, but over all good.  My husband got the same thing,  but covered and gravy, and said it didn't taste like gravy. It was a little spicy wich he liked,  but not what he was expecting.  My daughter got the Rib eye steak and eggs, the stake was burned at the edges and it was mostly fat, and veins,  the menu stated that it came with French fries,  but it came out with burnt squared spicy potatoes? Her meal was the worst.  She had some of my food instead.    Now on to the service.  Man they were busy, and ooohh so slow. They sat us right away,  but seemed so unorganized. Like no one had a clue what to do. Don't get me wrong our server was very nice, we just didn't see her much.",

I sat in the bar area tonight (New Years Day) and can't remember my server's name, but she was very attentive and joked around with us. If I remembered her name, I'd make sure to request her each time. I ordered fried catfish and a fried chicken breast with the fries and beans over rice. The beans over rice was so tasty that I'd willingly eat only that as my meal. The side of ranch I got with my fries was hands down the best ranch I've ever tasted. The hot sauce they have brought out the taste of the chicken. I'm pretty sure the catfish was corn meal breaded because it was so good I wanted to punch someone. God I seriously can't get over this place. My meal was $15, and it was so big that I have another full meals worth of leftovers. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I were heading to Sweet Tomatoes when she mentioned that she would like to try Lo-Lo's. No time like the present, so we went there with kind of high expectations.  Things did not start well from the moment we walked in. It was about 3:30 PM and the place was clearly not very busy. We stood by the cashier's station with the sign to wait to be seated. And we stood there, and we stood there. Finally a young woman showed up and said she wasn't clocked in yet, but she would seat us and she did. She discovered that the cleared table wasn't wiped off. She got a cloth and wiped the table clean. She repeated that she wasn't on the clock yet, but someone would take care of us. That was the last service we got.  The room we were in had two other booths and one table occupied and one waiter who appeared to be responsible for the one table only, for he doted over that table, but never offered any service to anyone else. Another party was leaving as we entered.  As we were viewing the menu, a second young lady came to take our drink order. We each ordered tea and like magic, the waitress disappeared never to be seen again.  We settled on what we wanted using menus that apparently had never been wiped off and were sticky and waited for the teas and waitress to arrive. In the interim, another party of 4 was seated at a table. They were waited on by another waitress and received their drinks in short order.  And we waited, and we waited. The music was so loud that it was difficult to talk across the table and various employees would wander about with no apparent purpose, some even coming to the room entrance only to turn around and disappear and some wandered through the room as if lost. And we waited while employees appeared to play musical chairs through the room. It appeared to me that the employee's acted as if they were in a social club rather than a place of employment . . . you know, where you work for your employer.  Finally, we left in disgust. The woman cleaning the glass on the front door wished us a good day as we left. Her efforts would have been more profitable if she had she been waiting on customers.  We would have complained to management, but it was clear there wasn't any.  It seems clear that Lo-Lo's doesn't understand who is their competition. We walked across the parking lot to Sweet Tomatoes to eat a very pleasant lunch where the music wasn't blasting, everything was clean and the two of us ate for the price Lo-Lo's wanted for either one of us.  Time wasted, lesson learned. We won't be trying Lo-Lo's again.",

The reason we were told our order was late was because the chicken wasn't done. Don't know any restaurant that takes 40 minutes to make fried chicken. Even after getting our food half of my order was wrong. Plus my pancake was burnt like toast. Food was decent but I have had way better in Phoenix, AZ. Next we get our bill and the manager claimed the best he could do was take 15 percent off our bill. I will never eat at this location again!",

I had the catfish and couldn't resist getting a croquette on the side.  I heard the fried chicken is crunchy and seasoned well.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Only thing is... that ITTIS hit me quick.  I had to stop for coffee just to get home!  But I'm going back for the pineapple upside down pancakes. Makes my mouth water just thinking about them.  The bar, food and service was great.  I'm holding a point for cleanliness because the bathroom needed attention and I had to send my silverware back for a fresh set.

The hostess told us that they can't accommodate a party of 5 in a booth, meanwhile there are plenty of open tables we can visibly see, and we're giving the servers time to catch up on their tables. This place needs to hire proper amount of staff and not give us bullshit excuses, if you knew you were short staff then you should tell guests up front instead of having us wait for a long time. I've been here before and it was not like this. They just lost a customer, I recommend not coming here, unless you like your time wasted or have nothing to do. My family is going to some place else. Hopefully, they're not full of excuses",

Once we were seated,  it took the server a very long time to take drink orders and bring our beverages to the table. After 20 minutes she came back to take our food order. We were waiting for our food to come for a little over an hour a half while being told our food was \"coming out next\" or \" I'll go check\". We asked what was taking so long and the server response was that \"the kitchen just got a bunch of tickets the were put in ahead of us\" AFTER we were already waiting for more than a hour and a half. Our server had no sense of urgency to get our food to us or to even try to make something happen, she never came back to refill our beverages, and also payed no attention to us unless we got up to find her or ask another server to grab her.    I will not recommend going to this place unless you like terrible service or plan on being there for your server's whole work shift!",

But first when we came in we were seated right away which was good the waitress took our order and went on about her business. 2 other tables came and ordered their food and somehow got their food before ours. But ok no worries right? Wrong about 15 minutes later our order comes out mind you this is after I had drunk the whole pitcher of koolaid which was surprisingly good. So any way on to the food. The catfish was THE hardest saltest unseasoned piece of fish I have had in a long time. The greens which again were recommended were tender but again they were very underwhelming. The grits were cheesy and ok and the cornbread was good. He said his waffle was decent and he got a southern skillet but he wished the potatoes were cut smaller he said it was just alright. The server however was un-attentive. O well I guess at least we can say we tried Lo-los and they charged $1 for a to go cup.",

I got really annoyed when I called in to place a to go order and whoever answered the phone (today) said they was not taking phone orders at this time. Ok cool maybe they super busy and have a line out the door so I get in my vehicle to head to restaurant to order my food to go. I pull up and get a nice good spot in front of restaurant because there wasn't many cars. Walk inside and it's not busy at all and i could be seated right away if I wanted to sit. Walked up to the host who was not busy at all and did not have nobody at the front counter. I asked her if i could place a to go order with her and she said no. I would have to go to one of the servers or sit at the bar and order . I just wanted to get in and out and not go through all that for a take out. One of the managers were polite and did approach me and ask me was everything ok and have i been helped. I questioned him about not doing phone in orders and he did explain they don't take orders over the phone on sat and Sunday only because they're usually busy. Which i understand. Hopefully they can change this rule when they are not busy and hopefully they can also at least get the front desk clerk to help take orders so nobody takes up space at the bar/have to fight to get bartenders attention just to order a take out, or try and track down one of the servers who already has tables just to stand there and take my order.",

The Chicken was cooked to perfection! It was golden, juicy and flavorful! The waffle was a True Belgian Waffle. Sturdy on the outside and firm but soft on the inside. The syrup was a good quantity. I would've liked to see other syrup or butter options (Maple Walnut is my favorite.. lol)  Average price for a Chicken and Waffle plate is $10. It's definitely worth $10!!",

    "text": "So, before heading to Las Vegas my husband suggested we go to LoLo's he's heard from a few friends that it was a must try. In LA.. we know Chicken and Waffles, so we agreed.. we HAD to try.  We come to Vegas every few months but we made the most of our first visit to LoLo's and pretty much got like everything lol.. well we were a party of 7, so there's a reason!   We of course ordered the Chicken and Waffles... chicken was well seasoned and cooked crispy! I really enjoyed the waffle.. cinnamony lol.  I also ordered the shrimp and grits, the shrimp were fried, wasn't expecting that, and the grits lacked flavor. There were bits of bacon on it that were well done and seemed more like scrapings from the bottom of the pan. I don't have to have that again.  The chili cheese fries were delicious the stupid fries were tasty but the sauce was a bit salty.. follow up with some water for sure. My niece got the biscuits and gravy and sunny side up eggs.. looked good but not my cup I'd tea, she ate it all.. that says a lot because it was a huge portion and she's 10.  Side note, the shrimp and grits cane with a biscuit... baabyy.. it was good! Lol.  The Cadillac margarita was made right!! The have all these \"hood\" dranks made from koolaide my husband got a blue ivy, he said it was watered down.  Overall our visit was positive! The staff was great in accommodating our party!  I'd definitely come back!!",

There was a hint of cinnamon in the flavor and it was super yummy. It somehow managed to be slightly crispy but not over cooked. The chicken was delicious. Crispy and flavorful but not dry at all. I dipped it in their hot sauce which was great. We also ordered the fried green tomatoes but we finished them so fast I forgot to take a picture.   Our server Bree was excellent. She was also the bartender and she made an awesome Bloody Mary! We were so stuffed I MIGHT of had to unbutton my jeans on the ride home! The entire meal was about $40. We will definitely be back very soon!",

Not only was the ticket time much quicker than before but the food tastes better as well. My sister and I ordered the Tre Tres (2 drumsticks and a waffle - as pictured below). The food my SO and mother ordered are pictured below as well as our Kool Aid drinks. Overall I am EXTREMELY grateful that this new owner has stepped in and turned this establishment around, you can truly tell the difference. I was weary before but I will DEFINITELY be back now.",

After the wait we were escorted to our booth by a nice waitress. She took our drink orders and bought them back in a timely manner. We then went and ordered our food. The food took about 20-30 minutes to come. I was not so happy about this but this is where the five star experience comes in at. They have all the best music playing in the establishment which makes for a good atmosphere. Although we were waiting we were entertained. Also the waitress kept coming to check on us and update us on the status of our food.   When the food finally got to the table it was in large portions. All of the food was stellar. The drinks were good. They also do $3 mimosas all weekend long.   We just had an all over good time at this place. I left full and happy with the experience.   Bravo to the staff at this location. I hear wait times vary so that's just a variable to consider when thinking about eating here. But for me I give it 5 stars.",

    "text": "Perhaps the worst dining experience ever for any of us. We went to Lolo's for dinner on a Saturday night. We expected a wait but literally could not comprehend what happened.  The hostess greeted us and politely informed us that there would be a 45 minute wait. When we told her that we would go to the bar area while we waited, she said that the bar was closed. It was 8pm on Saturday with plenty of patrons and bartenders there. We all scratched our heads in disbelief.  Another from our party asked for further clarification, asking specifically about the 10-15 or so empty tables in the restaurant, to which our hostess replied that they were saving them (I guess all of them?) for two large parties of 15 each. We asked again if we would order drinks and use one of the empty tables in the bar (ie not dining area) to which she responded \"no\" to using the table but we were welcome to drink our cocktails outside on the patio. It was 111 degrees F that day!  Given that we were in Las Vegas, we chose to go to another restaurant. While all this happened, another party of 3 arrived after us and left bewildered having received similar treatment. That was all the validation we needed to never go back to this place.  Regarding the food, it smelled great but none of have any idea how it tastes and likely never will.",

Reading all these bad reviews as I was just about to drop my 5-star only dropped my jaw at the thought of how entitled our nation has become because my experience was literally FLAWLESS.   Waitresses were working in teams, waiter stopped by often enough to be useful, but not so often where it's annoying, food presentation was even great too (my mimosa was multi colored and came with a cherry on top!) Even the music they are playing is cultural hip-hop. The staff was also incredibly conversational and friendly, a breath of fresh air, seriously!  You just plain do not get southern food and service like this anywhere else in the city. This trip I had the #1 which is chicken, waffles, eggs, and grits. Ahhazzzzzing!! I'll be back 10x and can't wait to try the other items on the menu.   Edit: I had just asked the staff about the reviews and if there had been any changes recently. It looks like ownership has just changed about 3-4 weeks prior to me writing this. As you may notice from my profile, I'm a 1-star or 5-star kind of guy. Either a place wows me or falls short, that's really the only time I bother to leave a review honestly. Warn people when a place is bad and tell the world when it's great.  Hopefully I can be the first if many more 5-star reviews to come!",

    "text": "1 star service, 1 star quality of food.   Service: Their service was unprofessional, to say the least. Never in my life have I ever received such crappy, unwelcoming service at a restaurant. The hostesses were what started it off all wrong. Just plain rude and immature. The wait for a table was well over 30 minutes, which was whatever, I kind of expected it with them being a new \"hot spot\". But the wait for our food was also WELL over 30 minutes as well. But what made it even more annoying is that the waiter would come to our table every 15 minutes and say \"It'll be just one more minute for the chicken to finish guys.\" And he was such an awkward server too. Whenever he'd check on our table he wouldn't say the normal \"You guys doing okay?\" Or \"Can I get you anything else?\", instead he'd stand right next to our seats and just hover over our table without saying a single word. Awkward.   Food: I ordered the Betty's Boob, which was described on the menu as 1 succulent chicken breast and 1 delicious waffle. All very True... minus the \"succulent\" and \"delicious\" part. I found it funny how the server kept claiming the wait was for the chicken yet our chickens came out either burnt or dry. And there was no way in hell we were about to send anything back and wait another 30 minutes for new chicken. I ended up just eating half of my chicken till I decided I was over it, then ended up giving the other half to my cousin cuz his chicken came out burnt and nasty. As far as the waffles, everyone's right, they're not horrible but they're super soggy. The waffle was the only thing I finished on my plate.   I don't know if we came on a bad day or on a day they decided to schedule all the crappy workers together, but my experience was NOTHING like what I read on some of the other reviews lol.   Hopefully this place will get its act together in the next couple of months. It'd be nice to be able to get some good chicken and waffles without having to drive all the way to Cali for some.",

The wait was very very very long. None of us were greated at the door, no \"Welcome to LoLos\" or \"Good Morning\" or anything.  We all had something wrong with our orders, they forgot half of the eggs, they didnt melt the cheese on the eggs, asked for sides of bacon, bacon never came. The bus boy said \"aight, i gotchu\" when we asked for something. Just ridiculous over all.

The waitress was very slow to actually let us order though and the whole time we were there  she only offered to fill my coffee once.   After ordering the wait for food was extremely long, probably 30 minutes.  When food finally arrived the waffles were cold and limpnthe chicken was barely room temperature.   My chicken was okay but jeff's was really dry (as if it had been under a heat lamp).   We couldn't even get the server woman's attention to complain.   Overall I would say that getting chicken from KFC or Popeyes and pairing it with eggs toaster waffles would give higher quality food.

Which was fine, but after 45 minutes we eventually tried to seat ourselves at the bar & were ignored for another 10-15 minutes with a disgusting, dirty bar in front of us. We decided to get back on he list for a table & were finally seated after a bit. We watched 3 other tables that were sat after us get their drinks & food orders in before anyone ever greeted us. Once we finally were able to place our order, our spicy corn fritters came out ice cold in the middle. The waitress took them away & brought the same ones back out, just fried a little longer. I ordered the salmon croquettes & they smelled really fishy (which usually means bad/old fish) but hardly had any real fish in them. Just lots of stuffing & inedible pieces of who-knows-what. The grits were MOSTLY butter, hardly any grits. Meanwhile, they look like they have a full staff but no one knows what to do at all. Not sure how they got a grade 'A' on their health inspection on 1/23 because it was all pretty gross. This was, without a doubt, the worst dining experience I've ever had. Do yourself a favor & don't go here.",

    "text": "We arrived as a party of 10. We knew this could be a problem, so we called ahead to let them know. They said they do not take reservations and that we can just show up. Once we arrived, we were told by the hostess, that since our party was over 8 people, we had a limited menu of 16 items. That just wasn't acceptable, so we got to speak to the manager. He explained any table over 8 people would stress the kitchen. This was a Monday at 9:45am. There was no stress going on. We asked him if he was OK losing a table of 10, over a simple technicality of 2 extra people, and he said that's the rule. He kept emphasising it was the rule. As we all turned to walk out, he said he would make an exception this one time, since it was still early and not busy. He acted like he was doing us a favor, making a complete ass of himself in front of our group.  To the food: I had the Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles. The meal that is also the name of the place. It comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken came right out of the fryer. It was incredibly juicy but had no flavor. It barley had any seasoning in the breading. The waffles were average size and had a hint of cinnamon mixed in. They were better than the chicken, but they were soggy. They were more like textured pancakes than waffles.  They have a variety of coolaid flavors to choose from. 3 of our party got the watermelon flavor. No one could finish it because it was way too sweet.  At the time of this review, they have only been open for about 4 weeks. You can really tell that not every employee knows what's going on yet. There was a table of new hires right next to us going through orientation. I will give it a month or 2 for them to work out the kinks and try one more time. It is just a shame a restaurant with chicken and waffles in the name, has no so good chicken and waffles.  Oh yeah, they do not have there liquor license yet. So don't expect to get a drink.",

I was very surprised the chicken was over cooked, chewy and no flavor after you got past the skin. The Shrimp and Grits was so overloaded with grease, my stomach is really not doing well. Service was 3rd rate no setups, and the food took forever. So sad, was excited to try it.",

When the drink order came it wrong and my coffee mug was splattered with egg yolk. After another long wait our server finally took our food orders and I asked for a fresh cup of coffee.  When the food finally came out or server brought out a new cup of coffee but it was ful of coffee grounds floating in the mug and smeared up the sides. The food was adequate but we were completely ignored by our server after we got our food. Bottom line even if the food is ok, it is served on dirty dishes and the service is lousy. This will be the only time I ever eat here.",

Well, we finally tried LoLo's. But for delivery only. Looked at their website and was very easy to access the different areas of the menu.  The names of the dishes are adorable and so we ordered 2 breasts and waffles, 2 chicken wings with waffles and 1 thigh and 1 leg with waffles. Also, 1 order of rice n gravy and 1 order of French fries n gravy. The website menu does not have $'s and I understand because of the cost of chicken especially breasts and wings so that really didn't bother me but when we picked up our food, the Hostess was very nice. I asked that I am picking up a delivery and this was our first time trying LoLo's. She said, \"You will Love LoLo's if you Love chicken and Southern food. Very nice, our hostess, gave us all the condiments that we needed for the dishes . And, she said I know you will be back but sometime dine in, ok? I said, ok. Well, when we got home and put everything on the table, it looked liked we were at the restaurant. The fried chicken was just as crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside as was the wings which were very nice size and the leg n thigh also were very good! The rice n gravy was good especially the gravy! Love that gravy! The French fries were steak fries and a order of gravy and was delicious also!  We will be going back to LoLo's and the Hostess was right that we would be back! But this time, will be dining in and getting the whole experience of LoLo's! Thank you to the Hostess that really did a Great Job!",

He did not seem too friendly with me primarily, I do not know what i did to him or if i did anything at all. Maybe he was having a bad morning, or maybe because i asked for the ribeye and eggs. However, I do know for a fact that I did not do anything for this guy to treat me the way that he did. When we finally got our food about 20-30 minutes later due to having only one cook, (nice amount for the price btw), I did not get what I ordered. But that was not the problem. The problem was the lack of professional eye contact and attitude when i addressed the problem with my order. Again, i do not know what i did to make this dude continually upset with me, but he did not even look in my direction when he said he will let the manager know. So ge goes to the back and tells the cook or whoever he told, my wife was watching and said that him and who he told was laughing. For as long as he and the guy he was laughing with are still working there, I won't ever be back",

He showed us to our booth.and before we could sit down and take a look at the menu he was asking what did we want to drink. We had water because we had not had a chance to view the menu. Shortly afterwards he returned with the water and wanted to take our order so I felt rushed and hurried up and gave a choice. I order the southern choice meal that came with 3 pieces of chicken 2 sides and a muffin. A short period later a female came over with our order. Needless to say I had a wing breast and leg. My wing was partially done, full of grease, and golden brown. My breast and leg were dark, salty, and tasted like it was cooked in old grease. The server returned with the bill. This is by far the worst food that I have tasted since I've been in Vegas. I can admit that my sides of dirty rice and collard greens weren't bad. But the greasy old salty chicken turned my stomach.and made me nauseous. So the whole meal was not a winner. I don't think I will be returning to this place with the awful service. This was my second time visiting this restaurant and my first time was great. I received great service and the food was delicious which prompted a return visit. This visit have become a stop sign and I doubt if I return.",

When we came in we noticed it was not as busy as other restaurants are on Sundays so we were hoping for quick service.  Our waitress gave us time to look at the menu before ordering. We both ordered 3 piece chicken with macaroni and a waffle.  Not once did our waitress or manager stop to check up on us. My friend would try to get any of the servers attention but no one stopped. 30 minutes later when he got a waitresses attention she said no before he asked a question. Then kept saying no interrupting him.  5 minutes later our waitress comes to tell us that our orders are next on the screen! Let me remind you there were no lines out by the door and the restaurant was not as busy.  After 40 minutes later and finally getting a refill the manager brings our food and all he says was \"sorry for the wait.\" And never came back to check on us.  While eating the waitress only checked up on us once.  Never coming back.",

From numerous Yelp reviews and many of my friends experiences, this place has non-existent customer service skills with long waits!  Came on a Saturday day about 12:00pm and there was a crowd outside waiting to be seated but we went straight to the bar and sat right away. I was told before they didn't have an alcohol license but thank god when we went they finally had it. Ordered a Melon Mojito, hey it's 5:00 somewhere right? It was pretty good.   Got our orders right away. I ordered a \"Baby C\" which had your choice of two thighs or two drum sticks with either grits or fries. I decided on the grits added some cheese on top which I really didn't like. The chicken was good tho, really juicy. The beau got waffles so I had some of his and it really did taste like the Infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.   We also got one of their popular items, Spicy Corn Fritters and everyone who walks through that door needs to try this! It's one of the best things I have ever eaten. The dipping sauce that comes with it just compliments it so much.   The bartenders were very accommodating. They didn't take long to take our order and bring our orders out. I did see the workers get a little snippy with each other but other than that customer service was not bad.",

The chicken was old and difficult to chew. When we discussed this with the manger, he stated the cooks cut up fried chicken breasts, and use them in the omelets. If that were the case, then parts of the chicken bits would have been moist. Instead each piece of chicken was encased in batter. Additionally, the banana pancakes were dry. The manager stated he had never had moist pancakes. Lol!! I have eaten enough pancakes to know they shouldn't be dry. Furthermore, I shouldn't have to add syrup to pancakes just to be able to cut them especially since they were already covered in caramel sauce.",

    "text": "Tried to check this place out a few weeks ago on a Sunday night around 6:00pm, but had to back out due to the line being out the door with a minimum hour wait. Post church rush possibly? Became a little skeptical when I started reading bad reviews about it, especially one from a coworker who USED to be a big fan of this place. Hmph.  Took a gamble this Saturday at 8:00pm... no line, no wait, requested a booth & was seated immediately. Bar was completely empty and they were surprisingly slow -- yet it took quite a while for them to take our order, I'm not sure if it's because they have an extensive menu but I had to flag someone down 15 minutes into sitting just so we could just order our drinks.  Their menu, as stated, was surprisingly extensive. They have an all-day breakfast section with omelettes, pancakes, french toast, eggs and more. They have a \"lo-lo's hood classics\" & \"the eats\" section that features a plethora of soul food-esque combination plates, with a long section of additional sides & add-ons. But we came here for the famous chicken & waffles, so that's what we opted for.   FOR HER:  - The \"TRE-TRE'S\" which came with two drumsticks & one waffle. The chicken batter was decent, so were the waffles -- which seemed to have a cinnamon kick. I also ordered a side of the BISCUITS & GRAVY ($4 for one, 6$ for two). They were much larger than I imagined and the sausage gravy was pretty tasty! FOR HIM:  - The \"BABY RAY\" with 3 piece chicken w/ gravy & onions and 2 waffles. He got the gravy & onions on the side to avoid it making the chicken soggy, which he was very thankful for as he did not like the gravy at all. I found the onions to be a nice touch, but also wouldn't have been happy with it smothered in it.  Overall, I have to say, being a fan of Roscoe's, my standards were set based off of them... which I honestly would have to say wasn't exactly up to par. Would we come back? Eh, yeah maybe in a few months if we ever have a chicken & waffle craving... but would we wait an hour for seating or risk coming when it's actually busy? Yeah, pass.",

Better service at I Hop or Mc Donald's.  And this on a Monday, can imagine how it on the weekends.

Since we had been discussing whether we thought we might have to wait forever for our food I turned to my husband and said \"I'm not sure after it took this long to be waited on\". I was thinking he might take the hint and offer an apology but no...instead he said, \"fine, I'll get a manager\" and walked away. Not sure what he expected a manager to do but after another 5 minutes of nobody approaching our table we got up to leave. Stopped at hostess desk and explained why we were leaving and the hostess had us tell a manager. In all honesty, I don't think the manager really cared. Got the impression some of the staff we complained about might be her friends. No offer to make it right in any way. Sad, because we always try to support new places in our neighborhood, but this was bad enough that we won't be going back.",

I didn't expect much with regards to the food - you get what you expect which are chicken & waffles, however, there's more to restaurants than food. The service was horrible!

It would be a completely different story if we weren't getting told every 5 mins \"it'll be ready in 5 mins...\" It took almost 20 mins to get a drink at the bar........that was empty!!! When we eventually were seated at the table, we didn't even need to take a look at the menu since we had so much time to review it and decide what we wanted while we waited for our table. It took almost an hour to get our food! While I was eating, I couldn't help but notice the 2 MOD's (Managers on Duty) standing together on the side hanging on the railings like children hang on the playground chatting it up like they don't have a restaurant to run and customers to satisfy. The food was delicious but not good enough for me to pay a second visit because the service was beyond terrible. If Yelp had an option for negative stars, I'd give them -5! Vegas is known for service regardless if the restaurant is on The Strip or around the corner from your house. My advice (and this is coming from a very seasoned F&B hostess/server/bartender/manager) is to step up your game if you want to survive!",

We noticed half the restaurant was empty, we weren't sure why the wait was that long to be seated. Anyway, we ordered our drinks first, they came quick and tasted great! Then we ordered. After placing the order I decided to change my mind immediately after ordering to a different entree I hadn't noticed, literally was less than a minute after we had finished placing it. The lady was nice about it and said she'd fix it. We waited about a half hour for the food, and when it came out it was completely wrong for the both of us. The runner and a different bartender were both confused and didn't say a word to us. 10 minutes later the bartender who took our order came over to us and apologized, saying that the fact I changed my order screwed everything up. A bit insulting but whatever... We then received our orders and they were correct. The food tasted great!!! Especially the Mac n cheese was on point!!! We asked for the check when we finished and they forgot to charge us for one of our entrees. We gave our cards for payment and they came back to us, saying they had given us the incorrect order on the receipt. The new receipt was completely incorrect and we were confused about that. We explained that wasn't our order and they became confused once again. 5 minutes later they came back to us with the correct receipt and apologized for the inconvenience. We signed the checks and left. The customer service could've been better in my opinion, but at least everything turned out correct in the end. The food tasted amazing, so we'll probably be back sometime. We definitely won't come here starving though.",

A bunch of girls standing around the register looking like they were deep in convo and couldn't be bothered. I approached and said ide like to order take out. One girl handed me a menu and very dryly told me to have a seat. I sat at a nearby bench and made my choice, went back to the register and started to place my order. After i was done talking, another girl told me that they dont do take out, so i will have to sit down at a table, order my food, box it, and then leave. So i asked if i could sit anywhere, they said yes. I walked over to the bar and as im turning around, the girls are all snickering as if im the one with the problem. I ordered my food with the bartender telling him ide like white meat only (chicken and waffles with grits) with a fruit punch koolaide. The bartender tells me that there are no substitutions but points out another meal similar to what I'm asking for. Its more expensive but i agree and continue (i know i should've left at that point but i was hungry and hungover). No coffee or water offered to me btw, after all i AM dining in right?? Wrong! The food comes out pretty quickly (questionable but no real complaint there) and the bartender and i start boxing it together. No gloves or sanitizer, just boxing my food up. It wasn't until i was in the car when i realized that the koolaide was extremely watery and when i got home i see gave me a thigh instead of breast like I had asked and paid extra for. I absolutely hate dark meat. I didn't bother calling to complain because something told me that my concerns wouldn't have been met anyway. Instead I've decided to leave a very honest yet opinionated review. Avoid this place if you can. Even if the service is great and you get what you ordered, the food itself is mediocre, the drink was bland, and it was super overpriced. Not worth the 23$, i couldve gone to the grocery store and made my own grits with chicken and waffles for half the price.",

We put the menus down and begin discussing day events.....5 min go by, then 10, then 15, then 18....at the 18th minute i have watched the full first quater of the golden st vs memphis game......my mom was like really this olace is empty...i immediately  see the problem, one server to handle the entire restaurant....its 530pm.....we get up and go to sweet tomatoes.....we were both very disappointed.....please dont let this place go out of business because you are trying to save on labor cost. You need to adequately staff your resraurant for predicted business flow....as in most of the complaints on here its all service related. You need to understand your profit margin/labor cost should have no equilibrium value....the employees didnt care neither did the manager on staff when we complained....please give me a call 7025749339, this is my business. Helping restaurants who have no idea what they are doing.....ill help train your staff so the service is top notch..and you wont run into inadequate bodies on the floor and still save labor cost dollars......as your business platform is beginning to go downhill and fail as people are walking away and your losing customers .....only been open less than a year....its a shame when you have less competent mangers running such a great product business.....",

    "text": "We tried this place after we were so excited about it opening up. However the experience wasn't something I would recommend to anyone. The greeter gal was the  very sweet and happy upon our arrival. Our server wasn't so great. Our order was nothing out of the ordinary couple deserts for the kiddos, an appetizer dinner for the adults(kid had already eaten). My husband ordered a beer took longer then usual to receive no worries. I ordered a salad asked to substitute the cherry tomatoes out for just a slice or two tomatoes (like what they use for their burgers) was told no substitutes can be made on salads. No worries just skip the tomatoes then I don't want them. Our food arrived and our server came back to let us know \"you're going to hate me but we don't have ranch\" okay no problem do you have honey mustard? \"No.\" I get it is soul food but it's still a restaurant offering salad and chicken..... There needs to be more then balsamic dressing available. Not that dressing is the end of the world but I decided not to have dinner with my family because I didn't have any. My salad did however have those cherry tomatoes I asked specifically not to have. The chicken was extremely salty and I was given a box to bring mine home. I don't plan on going back which is a shame because we truly enjoy dinning at new places. This one just didn't make the cut for our next dinner outing.",

    "text": "Went here as a group of 8 to celebrate my friend's daughter's talent show performance and we were told it would be a 30 minute or less wait.  Half the restaurant was empty.  Adults waited at the bar where the nice bartender who was both bartender and waiter took forever with the drink orders.  Asked the hostess twice after half an hour had passed how much longer and they said another five minutes, twice they said this and then they told us another 3 minutes. I asked if we could sit in empty area or even outside and they said they only had one server handling it so they couldn't??45 minutes later we were seated in the main dining area. Ordered immediately and drinks took another 12 minutes to come out and no straws either.  I had to get up and get those myself. Took another 30 minutes to get our food. And the food was mediocre and overpriced for chicken.  Wine costs $7 which is more than a local bar!! Needless to say we tipped badly and doubtful we will ever be back.  Management was nowhere to be found and when I asked for the manager they never appeared.  This place needs to retrain and add more staff as the servers clearly needed help and didn't seem very experienced.  They were nice the whole time while I tried to remain calm but I blame management who should have stepped in and helped out.  Should have comped our dinner or drinks or something too.  The prices need to be readjusted as it's way too high. What a shame.  Not coming here again.",

But I was really disappointed when I visited this Las Vegas location.  Waited outside for a table and when we were called about 20 minutes later, we were escorted to our booth past a number of \"empty\" tables.  There were plenty of staff on hand; so I'm not sure why customers had to wait to be seated (some didn't wait and left immediately.  In hindsight, smart move.  The food:  The waffles were warm but not enough to melt the ball of butter sitting on top and the chicken tasted and looked like it was leftover from the day before.  Yuch!!  Not crisp, but mushy tasting - total turnoff!  $13 for three pieces of chicken and two waffles!  Over-priced and not worth the money for sure.  To those who were happy with the food, you lucked out.  At these prices, all the food should be fresh!  And hot!",

I had a melon mojito it wasn't spectacular however the ga on my mind had good reviews from our table. I ordered the mix and match with and additional Wing and my sides of Mac and spinach. Naturally I added a little salt and pepper to the sides. Our servers name was Patricia , she was absolutely wonderful. Kept it very blunt with us. ALERT : they only split checks 4 ways so if you're with a large part be aware.  Back to Patricia. She took very good care of us , kept us updated with our food status and beverage status. Friendly and very honest. Ask for her when you come!!",

We added our name to waitlist on yelp, when we arrived we had to wait maybe ten minutes for a table.  The only complaint I have is the music was extremely loud.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to this center from the strip because my costume designer wanted us to meet at the Joanne's across the way. When my boyfriend saw the sign for chicken and waffles he was like \"we are going there after\". So we did. Because of the old sign, I assumed it was a small hole in the wall place. Low and behold we drove around the center and almost missed it because it's a large stand alone building with gorgeous light bricks and new onings. When we walked in we were immediately greeted and entered into a large entry way with the bar directly in front of us. The place is very well designed with oversized high top booths and tables in the bar area and regular booths and tables in the restaurant. The space itself is very spread out and there isn't a single \"awkward table\" in the place. We were seated at the high top booth that overlooks the entire restaurant. Steven was our server and he greeted us immediately and asked if it's our first time. He acquainted us with the current happy hour specials. I unfortunately am gluten free and he helped me put my own meat together that wasn't on the menu. He continually checked on us and the second any of our drinks were empty he was there to fill them. I noticed that the hostess and runners work together to always stay on their feet getting things done rather than twiddling fingers. They immediately greeted people at the door, immediately took dirty dishes away and really helped out the servers, this is not something we typically see at a restaurant that isn't Michelin or at least 4 stars on the strip.   Thank you Tiara and Steven for taking such great care of us, we will absolutely drive the 30 minutes to grab some amazing southern soul food!   Tiara   Steven",

The waffles are okay. They don't really have that buttermilk flavor that you typically get with waffles. I wouldn't be apposed to be going back, but it won't be a place that I rush to get to again.",

It felt more like being welcomed into a friend's home than being seated at a restaurant. The hostess was awesome and so was our waitress.  I had the Malaysia cheeseburger and fries. The burger was actually seasoned and had flavor. Burgers are usually a safe bet, but this was more than that. It was genuinely GOOD. My husband got the #3 (can't recall the name) with three piece of chicken and two waffles. The waffles are cinnamon-y and fluffy. The chicken was moist and the skin was crispy and delicious-I kept stealing his food. We will definitely be back, and I'll be trying some breakfast options next time!",

I was pleasantly surprised although Roscoe's will continue to be number 1 in my book. Lolo's is a good alternative if you have a taste for chicken and waffles.   I had 3 fried chicken wings with 2 waffles. The chicken was fried to an excellent crisp however it could have used more flavor. The cinnamon infused waffles were perfect!   We had great service from our server Sparky. He had a lot of energy and a fun personality. His drink pitch enticed me to order a watermelon Kool Aid! I hadn't had Kool Aid in years. It was awesome and tasted like watermelon Jolly Rancher!   I didn't try any other menu items so my review is based solely on their signature menu item.",

We were seated at 12:45 pm and we ordered our food within 10 minutes. Our waiter, Nate, was kind and as attentive as a waiter can be to a table without their food. It took ONE HOUR for our food to get to our table. There were four of us, two kids (macaroni & cheese and a banana pb&j) and two adults (burger, medium well, and chicken & waffles). We did not order anything that took an hour to cook. The place was not busy. Only two tables were filled in the center and there were a couple booths open as well. We understand if it is packed the wait will be longer; however, more tables were empty than were filled. We are very disappointed because the food is delicious - the only food related issue was that the burger was well done instead of medium well.",

I even got extra napkins and plates without asking the server (as i notmally do). I dined alone, so they were kind enough to put me in a less conspicuous seat.   I knocked off a star as they should update the operating hours outside the door. I stopped by the night prior, very hungry but was turned away as they are closed.  Disclaimer: on my secons attempt, I had late lunch at 2pm so everything was delicious. But the serving size was huge, they let me take home and even offered sweet tea to go. Awesome!",

    "text": "The food was fantastic however, the service was really really bad! Prior to visiting, I read the reviews and the majority of the patrons had the same complaint. We (3 in party) ordered our food at 12:58pm and received it at 1:38pm. When the food arrived, we were exiting our booth however, the server encouraged us to stay.   Based upon the serving time, one of the plates were cold and had to be returned. I spoke to the server and voiced my complaint and she said the kitchen was short handed.   Usually when food is returned, the manager visits the table, apologize and offer some kind of commiserate. In this instance, the manager never visited which was shocking. I inquired and discovered he was assisting in the kitchen.   Sorry to say, I will not be recommending this restaurant because of the service. However, if the manager had visited, I would have recommended the restaurant based upon GP.   The server (Starr) was great however, she could not compensate for a slow, understaffed and unorganized kitchen.   If you visit, be prepared to sit ten minutes before ordering and an additional thirty minutes to receive your food!   My son and his girlfriend who are locals, complained about the same thing and said that they visited once and haven't returned.   If you visit and don't received your food within 15-20 minutes run   don't walk, RUN away!",

    "text": "Wow! You talk about gooood home down soul cooking! I went to lo lo's last night (2/23/2019) I ordered the smothered chicken with the Mac and cheese and butter and rice... I couldn't stop eating my daughter asked me if she could taste it I let her and she said Miom, why are you eating cold food you know you like your food hot. It was so good I couldn't help myself so she told the waitress it was cold and the waitress wanted to take it back for hot food I refused I said I'd eat it as it was because it was just that good. Well the next thing the owner came over and apologized about the cold food and said I'm gonna get you a hot plate let me box that plate up. Again I refused he told me I'm gonna take care if you. You take this plate home and think of us when you eat this plate. Well next thing I knew the hot plate of food was right there. This owner really cares about his customers and went the extra extra mike to make sure you are comfortable and had the plate of hot food you ordered. It's really good to see the customer service the waitress and the owner has for their consumers. I know I'll be going there more to taste everything on the menu and if I don't dine in I'll be calling for take out. Please stop in the atmosphere is great the service is fantastic and you'll get a hot plate of the best food you ever ate!!!!",

I ordered LoLo's entree and the others ordered pancake entrees. I must say, ALL of our food was DELICIOUS AND FULL OF FLAVOR! The drinks are refillable and they provide a prefect portion of food.   -Flaws: it took longer than expected for our food to arrive BUT it was hot and fresh when we got it. Also, our food didn't come together. They brought things one by one which was weird, but I don't believe that's their norm, probably some miscommunication in the kitchen on a holiday. We had everything within 5 minutes, but it would've been better if it all came together.  -Don't order sides, just stick with the meal you order.  A side of any meat is an extra $4. Too expensive for something bland and basic. This includes a side of eggs, not with it!  Other than that. ...... I WILL DEFINITELY BE RETURNING!!!!",

When we arrived the atmosphere was great, they were playing gospel music Sunday morning which was very nice. The decor was vibrant and clean also. We mentioned to our waiter Brandon that we enjoyed the vibe here so far, prior to eating. He was very friendly and thorough and seemed as if he would be an excellent waiter until he took our orders. We didn't see Brandon until after it was time to pay the bill and even then he messed that up. My husband didn't get the cheese and grits he originally ordered so he canceled them. My brother wanted a basic three wings and a waffle special. He never received his meal they kept bringing him different meals, so he actually ate whatever they gave him. I'd also recommend that they season their chicken and fish before applying the batter and frying with at least salt and pepper. This will give the food a taste rather than relying on sauces for flavor.",

The ONLY reason I didn't give this a 0 is because it's technologically impossible to do so on this app. We had 10 people and only 2 plates delivered from 12:45 to 2:08pm.   The waiter tried but he couldn't make up for us not getting our food. The coloring books and water couldn't overcome the kitchen inefficiency.  To make matters worse, we asked for a manager 3 times and the coward refused to come to the table to at least address the fact that there was an issue...just stayed in the back.",

I ordered a sweet tea and they brought out an unsweetened tea I told her that I ordered sweet tea and she had an attitude and told me she'd come back with the right drink!  It took them over 25 mins to bring back my drink and it was still incorrect! I asked another waitress if she can bring it and she put her finger in my face and told me to wait! My girlfriend ordered grits and catfish and it took them over an hour to bring it to her and they didn't let her know what was taking so long with her food! When they came out they just told her to substitute her side of grits because it's going to take too long! Never have I ever had a problem with this restaurant but I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN! Worst service ever ! Do yourself a favor and don't go here! If I could rate them a zero I would !!!",

If it's souther style to give extremely bad service this place has nailed it. I sat in the bar area on a very slow Monday afternoon. After being seated by the hostess I sate there for 5 to 8 mins before even being greater by the wait staff. When the waitress finally came over there was no warm greeting or smiling face. I was obviously a burden in her very slow day. I waited another 5 mins to get my diet coke and the food came out shortly after. That was the only thing that did happen fast.   The food came out a little too quickly. Like maybe it had been precooked and was sitting and waiting under a heat lamp.  It tasted like it had been too. The fries were stale and a few were very hard, like they were a day old. The batter on the chicken strips had little to know flavor. I had to drench them in hot sauce  and ranch dressing to get them down. The white brest meat inside was nice and juicy but all that flavorless dry batter was too much.   The whole time I was there, about 40 mins the waitress only came over that one time, to take my order. I was so tired of waiting for the check that I got up and went to the hostess stand and had them get it for me. Needless to say i left a 0 tip and never in life have I left a 0 tip.   It's you're choice, of course, but I would never recommend this place to anyone unless they want overpriced flavorless food and extremely bad service.",

    "text": "This place may be under rated.  Went on a Tuesday morning.  Nate was a great server! Nate was versed of the menu and checked on us frequently.  The atmosphere and outside seating option were a pleasant surprise.  The food was seasoned properly and was served hot.  Grits,  chicken,  and wake were on point! I love that the waffles were edible. The waffles were large in diameter not super thick,  the  flavor of the waffle was not compromised.  I loved the music,  the staff,  and bar area. Nice touch was having the chef come out and asked how the food  taste. I would recommend this venue to any and many to visit.  Weekends are busy but the food and atmosphere makes up for the possible wait times.  Try the Melon Mojito!",

The atmosphere is top notch and the wait staff is the best you will find in the city. My wife and I are in Vegas at least once a month and Lo-lo's is always our first stop. My wife is from Shreveport Louisanna .She says the greens and Mac & cheese taste like her grandma's. Try it , your taste buds will appreciate it.",

It was a little hot inside, they should consider ceiling fans. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. We order our food, which didn't take long to get. But as the food came out one of the waitresses dropped the cup of hot syrup all over my legs. I was in shorts so it was an easy clean up but it BURNED!!! She was very apologetic and handed me a towel to clean. I helped them clean it up then went to the bathroom to clean my legs. As I returned to my sticky seat the waitress apologized again. We ate, the food was good but it was hard to enjoy with my legs burning and my shoes stuck to the floor. When we finish the waitress brings the bill. No offer to complement for the burned leg or spilled syrup. I'm not one to cause a scene, so we pay with a fat tip of $0 and note of disappointment on the receipt. What at shame because there was so much potential. Now all is lost because your waiter BURNED ME WITH SYRUP.",

No friendliness to her. Just looked at us and said it's an hour wait. Looked around restaurant- lots of empty tables and dirty tables. Thought ok maybe they don't have staff. Asked if we could eat at bar and was told we were still going to wait an hour because kitchen it backed up. Just really rude and disorganized. I've been to the one in Phoenix and it has a different feel that I loved.  This feels very corporate.",

We originally tried the location in Arizona while on vacation and loved it so when we saw there was one here in Vegas we had to check it out. We always have great service every time we go, the servers are always friendly and upbeat. The food is always delicious. My favorite is the Stupid Fries! They are absolutely to die for. Whatever sauce they use as gravy is SO good! Now don't get me wrong, this definitely isn't our nightly or even weekly dinner spot, we'd probably be battling high cholesterol and obesity if we did but it's definitely a treat every once in a while. I highly recommend this place, maybe as your \"cheat\" day spot.",

Now the food it's served in good size portions and has good flavor. There drinks are served in big mason jars. I'd definitely come back.

    "text": "I came here the first Sunday after they opened.  That being said it was obviously crowded, and I knew there was going to be a wait because friends had gone the night before so I went in with patience.  There was five of us total.  We arrived around 1 o'clock and were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.  They don't have their liquor license yet so between us ice tea and diet soda was ordered. We did have the option to eat at the bar but we preferred waiting for a table.  After about an hour we checked to see where our name was on the list and apparently it had been called and we missed it.  Considering how crowded it was and the noise level the hostess needs to make a better effort of calling out names or getting some sort of mic system.  We had just missed it so they sat us next.  This was about 2 o'clock.  Our waitress told us that due to the crowds the wait time from ordering our food to receiving it  would be about 30-35 minutes.  We all ordered immediately since we had an hour at the bar to watch plates come out and peruse the menu.  An hour passed and our food came out.  My table mates were getting a little ancy at this point.    I ordered the KK's.  Three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs and grits.  The chicken is fried to perfection but also perfectly juicy.  I ordered it with breast, thigh, and wing, but it came with two wings, so not sure if I got lucky or if that's the way it comes out.  Can't go wrong with scrambled eggs with cheese and onions.  The grits were a little watery but not a deal breaker.  The waffles had a cinnamon flavor to them that I also enjoyed.  Someone else at the table commented that they would have preferred more crisp waffles but I think that's a personal preference.  Previous to that I had sampled the fried green tomatoes ordered for the table with a honey mustard type of dip.  Those I would order a again for sure.  The portions are very generous so next time I might change my chicken selection or get a to-go box as I did this time.    Service was attentive and we learned a little bit about the history of LoLo's.  Because of the wait one of my table mates did ask to speak to a manager and a more than fair discount was given so props to management for being so apologetic about the wait even though it was to be expected.  I will definitely be returning after a few weeks when the crowds die down but most likely not on a Sunday because that appears to be a just out of church crowd which probably even once it dies down those larger parties will continue to flock there on Sundays.",

    "text": "In Vegas to attend the Vegas Invitational High School Basketball Tournament at Mountain-view Christian School. This place was recommended by a friend.  Saturday afternoon around 2:30 pm we walked in, there was no wait.  My father saw this guy wearing the restaurants t-shirt and mentioned that the guy looked like a famous basketball player.  My son and husband both said, \"Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns.\" I looked and said, \"That's Kevin Johnson the Mayor of Sacramento.\"   My dad called him over and asked him if he was Kevin Johnson and he said, \"Yes.\" He said he'd just opened up the restaurant.  A little while later my dad called him over again and told Mr. Johnson that my son had just competed in a basketball tournament here and if he could give him some pointers.  He gave him some GREAT pointers on how to be a better guard.    Our server, Bree (Lead Server), knew the True meaning of \"Customer Service!\"  She was patient & attentive.  The other server were attentive too.  Even though it wasn't their table, they came by to refill my son's BIG OLE MASON JAR of Tropical Punch KOOL AID.    We started with appetizers, Fried Chicken Gizzards and Fries String Bean.  They were the BOMB. The dipping sauce that came with it was very flavorful.  We all had Fried Chicken and/or Fried Cat Fish.  They had a wide variety of sides.  I had fried Okra and Dirty Rice.  We ALL had to take doggies bags.  To eat on our flight back to LA.  If you get the chance to go to there you won't be disappointed.  Thanks Kevin and Bree!",

Being from California, I think my boyfriend and I were comparing Lo-Lo's to Roscoe's a little too hard. Oops. However, I did find the chicken was sooo juicy. The chicken's breading was crunchy but it was ok-tasting, nothing too special. The eggs, onions, and cheese were alright. They weren't as airy/fluffy as I'm used to. I enjoyed how thick the waffles were. The next time I visit, I would ask for the waffles to be cooked a little longer for that crunch since they were on the softer side. All together, I especially enjoyed Lolo's affordable pricing for the amount of food you'll receive!",

Only thing I would suggest is having different types of syrup because the syrup was a little bland and they could have options for other flavors or sweetness.   My friend from out of town and I came here last night in hopes of meeting one of my favorite players growing up, the great Kevin Johnson. To our surprise he was the one that greeted us and sat us down to our table! He was very nice and patient with us. He's a very hands-on owner and you can see why he was a 2 term mayor of Sacramento.  He's not the only celebrity in the house. I recognized his brother-in-law who is a Korean-English interpreter for MMA/UFC Korean fighters. KJ's wife is also an author and was on the cover of Newsweek for Education Advocacy.   I will definitely be coming here again for the great experience and the food!",

My favorite is all the roosters around the restaurant and they're nice lighting. Even the music they play has some soul! Every time we go we were seated immediately. They give us menus for our kids to keep them entertained with crayons! The staff is great at checking on you during meal. And they also help answer questions mainly because I was never really familiar with a lot of stuff on the menu. Their portions are soo big. The lemonade and sweet tea are delicious. I've actually mix them myself and I've made my own Arnold Palmer but you can always ask for your own when ordering. I love their menu because we have so many options with chicken and waffle. You can get a breast, drumstick or thighs. My favorite is a chicken breast with a waffle and I also love their gravy and biscuits. The perfect time to come here if as soon as they open mainly because later in the day it gets packed. Especially on a Sunday. This last time we went we had a hard time getting the server's attention. We even sat next to the servers area where they put in the checks. Nobody gave us crayons this time or waters even straws were forgotten when they delivered our drinks. I had to go up and ask. Maybe it was a busy day but ill still some back",

It has tons of sausage and is a little spicy. Eggs were over easy without the whites being runny, which seems to be difficult to get at restaurants. Potatoes could have been cooked longer. They were too firm, but still edible. The Fried chicken was crispy while still remaining moist inside.  The greens had a smokey sweet flavor to it. No bitterness. Cornbread muffin was moist. We arrived early dinner time so had no wait and parking was easy. Our server was Nae and had a bubbly personality. She and other servers made sure to check on us regularly. Overall, very satisfied.

I would've loved to give Lo-Lo's 5 stars but here's why I didn't. To start, the host never acknowledge anyone as they entered and was very dry. Secondly, although the chicken was fried well, it tasted as though the oil was old.  On to the pluses! The waitress was good and continuously checked on us throughout our dining experience. Unfortunately, she didn't have a name tag on so I can't give her (Caucasian Female) a direct s/o. The portions were side and fit the prices. Besides the chicken tasting like it was fried in old oil, everything else tasted delish. The waffles are far better than Roscoe's, hands down. I give Lo-Lo's 2 's Up and looking forward to visiting again, when I'm back in town.",

The atmosphere is dull and boring, the waiters/waitresses have no urgency to serve you, and they have no enthusiasm. I ordered the Catfish, mac and cheese and the string beans. The catfish wasn't cooked all the way through it was under cooked..very soft when I bit into it. The mac and cheese was just ok but the string beans were actually pretty good. Very flavorful. The music played in the restaurant was way to loud and the bar was CLOSED so I couldn't order a cocktail which was very disappointing. And it was very early in the evening. I won't be visiting LoLo's again.",

This is worth a short drive from the strip if you want good service and delicious food. The choices are awesome. The drinks are also delicious.  The prices are reasonable..and the service is great. Star is such a sweetheart. Must get the waffles and mac and cheese. The chicken is seasoned well. The drinks are fun and tasty. The Lolo punch and the green apple koolaid are winners!

Excellent hot crispy chicken, not a drop of grease, tender and juicy on the inside. Waffles are of course southern not fluffy Belgian style. I like to add a little bit of hot sauce which gives it all a good kick in combination with the sweetness of the  maple syrup. Now looking over the menu there are some great value items here and not on others. Its a bit confusing as you look at the combinations of items wondering how they came up with prices based on them, so spend some extra time looking over the menu. Portions are generous and I left feeling full and satisfied without breaking the bank. Lo Lo's is a perfect addition to the area.",

When we went Saturday there was a long wait also but we sat in the bar area (everyone in the party needs to be over 21).  The menu is extensive but being our first time we had to try the Lo-Lo chicken dinner which consists of your choice of an three pieces of chicken (but not more than one breast) and a waffle.  We did wait a long time but our waitress was attentive bringing drink refills while we waited.  When our meals came out they were hot and vey tasty.  The chicken was crispy and delicious but the waffles could have been cooked more.  We all thought they were not done enough.  I will definitely go back but next time I would order the chicken with another side.  They had choices of beans and rice, grits, french fries.",

We made reservation in advance we we arrived our table was ready. The seating host was very nice and accommodating to our party. We were then created by the friendliest and most helpful waitress. She worked really hard. We placed our orders for the food and waited about 30 min for our food to be served.  Meanwhile we had a few drinks off the menu entitled (dranks) it was kool aide with a kick. The drinks were surprisingly delicious. The food was plentiful I had the fried chicken wings, greens, yams, and macaroni and cheese. I really enjoyed the meal.  The greens were seasoned to perfection. I am not a fan of sweet cornbread but it was served warm with butter for those who like cornbread that taste like cake.  One of the other highlights of the meal was the smothered chicken and waffles. Someone else at our table ordered it and said it was delicious. So if you are ever in vegas staying on the strip it would be worth it to catch an uber to Lo Lo's for some good tasting soul food.",

We arrived around 1200pm on a Sunday and the wait time was about 20 mins which was not bad. After getting our seats it took a server over 20 mins to take our drink order or to even acknowledge us. Afterwards we were ignored.  The time that it took to take our order was ridiculous.  Then after almost 2 hours of waiting on our food to arrive  I finally asked to speak to a manager, Nate, and within minutes our food arrived. He apologized and said he would offer us a discount.  The food itself was was wonderful. If we had not been so excited to catch up with my husbands parents we would have left. I dont know if it was a racial thing as we are a white family but every other black family was served and taken care of before us. The discount that Nate promised never happened instead he comp a drink. Needless to say, food was great, service was horrible.",

    "text": "Waitress was very nice and catering. However the greens was mushy as if it had been re-warmed to many times. The chicken was very bland and lacked seasoning. The Mac n cheese pic you see on menu and the one you get is two different things . It tasted like they used velveeta nacho cheese on it. I was expecting oven baked Mac due to pic advertised on menu. Maybe they was lazy that day.The catfish was the best thing on the menu but nothing to drive out your way for. I'd rather go to grits cafe. However if your looking for a good drink they do make great cocktails . This place is over rated and lacked season and real southern passion behind the food.",

They were cinnamony and dry then when syrup was added they got super soggy and shredded apart. Maybe it was just a bad batch they were super busy so maybe the chef was rushed. But I still plan on going back to try more dishes! Tip for all u, call and reserve a spot ahead of time!! Especially if its for more than 4 people. We waited for 2 hrs for 7 of us.",

She provided some cornbread and refilled a couple of drinks we had that were not normally refillable. When the food finally came out it look great I had chicken and waffles with side of grits and a scrambled egg with cheese and onion. The chicken was the best xhocken I had tasted in Vegas and the waffle was cooked perfectly. The eggs were food but I didnt get to eat the grits because I was full off the other stuff. Without the long wait Inwould have given it 4 stars but the manager did comp part of our bill because of the wait. I will be back again because of the great staff.",

And Waited.   Finally, I went to the bar and asked the server for a pitcher; the waiter did not know how to \"ring one up\"   So he just ignored us.   So we waited another 5 minutes for the server to talk to a manager-type person.   There was some discussion, but still no drinks.   There were 6 people talking outside, a cashier AND a Hostess, but no one would wait on us.   After a few more minutes, the waiter  said this bar only had one pitcher.   We almost finished the pitcher and we were ready to order, but again, no server with 6 people milling outside and two more by the cash register.   I had to ask one of the girls at the register to get us a server.  She went outside where there a lot of people and the server came.    It only got worse; the server offered no condiments, there was only one pitcher in this restaurant, and he had to take the empty one and wash it and refill it.   Then I had to request fresh, iced glasses that come with a pitcher.   We got some apologies after shortcomings were pointed out, but that server and all the folks on that day shift need training.    I personally spent many years waitressing so I know what good service is and what bad service is.    We had been on errands and I was thirsty before we got there.    Never again",

Try to season the chicken with more than lawry's to give it more flavor and add a touch of malt flour and perhps cinnamon to the waffle batter. Also, when serving 2 waffles, have it brought to the table quickly so that it stays crispy.  Overall, this restaurant was average at best",

We asked if he could make the recipe into waffles! He said YES and that our other food would come out while the waffles were being made. And he said the waffles would be no charge due to the inconvenience! The manager made the waffles as we requested and served them himself to us! AND the Pineapple Upside Down waffles were scrumptious!!!! The manager came back out to see if we liked them and we told him he should make that a menu item! In addition, the service was excellent and everyone was very friendly and courteous. This dining experience was truly pleasurable for this senior couple. Our thanks to Lo-Lo's!

The hostess was acting as a hostess/busser.  Then it took 20 minutes for someone to come to the table and ask us what we would like.  Since we had some time we decided to order an appetizer and order our food at the same time.   Appetizer came out fine however, our food was another story.  It took over an hour for the dinner to arrive.   While waiting I took my 2 granddaughters to the restroom and when I came back my daughter said they came and packed the leftover appetizer and were ready to give her the check.   She is like wait a minute we haven't received our food. And the waitress seemed confused.  Mind you we ordered Mac and cheese. Grilled cheese fried fish pancakes and biscuits and gravy. Simple meal.  Then an another lady came out and brought our food and we asked if they forgot our order and she did not apologize or seem to care.       I paid for the full meal.  Would I recommend this restaurant to family friends and coworkers.    No, I would not!!!   25 years of the restaurant and hospitality business.

Lo-Lo's chicken is juicy, cooked to perfection. Their corn bread muffin is to die for. However, went back for the second time - the chicken was still good, the corn bread muffin a bit dryer than the first time and the SERVICE, oh soooo bad. Sat for 15 mins still with no one coming up to even take our drink orders. We finally flagged down this kind waitress who insisted to take out orders even though it wasn't her area. The waitress in our area finally came and things got a bit worst. One thing for sure, when you want Lo-Lo's chicken get it to go! Hopefully that would be a better experience!",

    "text": "This evening my brother and I went to Lolo's for dinner. While there, we received the worst service. When we arrived there was only a large group and a few booths occupied. It took 15 mins. for someone to come to our table to take our drink order. When Brian came to the table he took our order and brought our drinks. We then waited another 30 mins for our server to come to the table. She immediately asked what we were eating for dinner without introducing herself. She finally introduced herself after we ordered. We waited a hour for our food to come to the table. The food was good but the chicken was dry. It would have been easier to bare if we would have had drink refills but that did not happen. I finally had to wave someone down to get a drink and a box. She then followed the guy I waved down to the table with the check (which was the 2nd time she came to the table). I stated that her service was horrible. She said \"I know, you don't have to tip me.\" Brian then asked what was going on and she told him our issue. His solution was to come back and ask for him and he would take care of us. He also went out of his way to state it again as we were leaving. But, you don't have to worry about that! Any place that doesn't value it's customers isn't a place to eat at all.",

    "text": "Horrible. This place was extremely empty when we arrived and yet we had to request a server. My friend's waffle was nice and golden brown like a waffle should be. my Waffle was very light in color and soft. I bit into the waffle and I could taste batter. The waffle is undercooked. The waitress brought a new waffle but it looks and taste exactly the same. I show her what is batter . The waitress says,  if you want a waffle golden brown you need to order it well done otherwise it's going to come out soft. (I have no reason to lie on this lady) I said my friend did not order a well done waffle and why didn't the waitress asked me if I wanted a undercooked, slightly cooked, or well-done waffle? The waitress says your friend probably got someone else's waffle. She then brings me a well done  golden brown delicious waffle .  I order grits,eggs, and fried chicken too . The Grits were extremely watery and the chicken was  seriously overcooked. Most of the food was still on the table when she brought the bill. Waitress said I didn't charge you for the other two waffles. I told her I would not have paid for raw food. I gave two stars because my mojito and my friends Kool-Aid vodka cocktail were absolutely delicious. I did order a 2nd cocktail but it never made it to the table. I thought the prices were acceptable. There's ample parking, it's easy to find, and they have one hell of a bartender. I don't know his name but he was the only Caucasian man behind the counter. It's located pretty far off the strip so I'm sure I won't go back. My experience matches the name of the restaurant.",

I saw so many people not being served! Or even greeted that it was embarrassing. This place attracts so many people traveling and this Memorial Day weekend! This shouldn't be the case that people continuously get seated but no one at least greeting them. We finally had a young lady come to us that took our order at 1030 and 11 hit and no food yet. We asked for the server to get the manager we live here in Las Vegas and if the service will continue to be this way then we will NEVER be back here! We just realized guest that arrived 20 minutes after us was served before us! Another group seated 10 minutes after us is being served! We received our food at 1120 and asked to speak to the manager at 1045 whom STILL HAVEN'T CAME! Nate (the manager) finally came gave a discount. My husband has over 500,000 followers all it takes for a bad review and many people will not come. Living in Vegas and being able to come back and see how the experience will be will definitely determine how that next review go. Sonya the waitress was AMAZING!!! And we appreciate her picking us up when no one else seemed to want too. Thank you!!!",

I expected a Raising Canes type of fast food, but it's actually a very inviting, classy, captivating sit down restaurant with a great atmosphere. Service was very good, and everyone was very friendly, from the host to the manager, even the bartender came by to ask how things were. Everyone tended to our needs in a genuine way, but no one was overbearing or annoying. Next, the food was delicious! Different tasting friend chicken than I've ever had, but so fresh and home style. Needless to say, DELICIOUS. And even better, the biscuits and gravy were TO DIE FOR! Yum, probably the best I've ever had, and I've had some good A** biscuits and gravy. Yummy french fries, too. Great cocktail selection (Georgia on my mind was very good). And to top it off, pretty dang affordable. Two meals and two alcoholic beverages came to $25 dollars. Needless to say, I'm very pleased and will be returning.",

This was my first time here and I got the #7 which I had 2 chicken thighs with a waffle and I also ordered a side of macaroni & cheese. My hunni ordered a 3 piece chicken with the waffle, grits and scrambled eggs with cheese & onion. Our order came out surprisingly quickly. First thing I noticed was that our chicken appeared to have been cooked in oil that needed to be changed. The looked \"almost burnt\". However I could taste the seasoning and it was very well seasoned. The mac & cheese was nothing to write home about and to me it tasted like kraft deluxe mac & cheese. Now the waffles were amazing and I don't care for cinnamon very much and it was just enough cinnamon to my liking and the butter was rich like I like it.",

We don't live nearby so it took a while for us to give it a try, I was hoping kinks would be ironed out and they had perfected everything, especially their namesake chicken. I had a doctors appointment up the road so I suggested getting some Lo-Lo's to take home afterward. It took quite a few minutes for someone to actually take our order but everyone was friendly and the place is really nice. It didn't take too long to get our food, we only got fried chicken and waffles. It sure smelled good! So the chicken has a nice crunchy coating on the outside but that was where the pluses turned to minuses. The chicken meat was dry and had no flavor, the outside coating had no seasoning it was just plain ole coating, blah! So dull! It was edible but not enjoyable. The waffle saved things, yes it was soggy but that was to be expected. It was yummy slathered in butter and syrup, it had a great cinnamon flavor to it, I would go back for just the waffles. I highly doubt I'd go back, but if I did, I wouldn't get the fried chicken.",

I always went to Hash House for mine and I expected the chicken and waffles to be way better since the restaurant is known for chicken and waffles.  The chicken was too crispy for me. The waffles are very flat and not toasted enough. One of my friends thought of it as KFC fried chicken with Lego My Ego waffles.  The GUEST SERVICING here was amazing though. They were friendly, catered to me periodically, and the kool-aid is DELICIOUS. If there's anything I'd come back here for is for the kool-aid, definitely.",

Thank god for KIERA who came over after she noticed the manager wasn't effective in sending the person assigned to our section over. There were so many employees on the other side of this restaurant standing around not doing anything. KIERA should be promoted to manager, she is fast, polite, and knows how problem solve instead of making shift change excuses which is what management did. Didn't know a shift change took 30min.",

    "text": "We arrived on a Tuesday evening to meet family visiting from Cali and the restaurant was literally empty. The waitress came to the table with no greeting or a smile. The food came and the chicken was okay , my family had fish and said that was good however I came here last year and I do remember the food was great! Not the case now. There was too much salt in the gravy and the potatoes.. The waitress was not attentive at all. She never checked on us and I had to stand up and wave to get her attention for some water. There were only 3 tables with customers. She came to bring the bill but never asked if we wanted dessert and by that time I had enough.  I was very disappointed and really was hoping this place was gonna be better especially after being shut down. I live on the other side of town but needless to say I'm never coming back. They lost what could have been a loyal customer especially since we have visitors all the time. Oh and this waitress was super flirty with our husbands but clearly didn't want to wait on us.",

    "text": "Hi, Welcome to Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles. I would like to say we were greeted right away, but that would be a lie. There were about 5 of us at the door waiting to be greeted. Phone in the hostess desk was ringing and someone ran to answer that. The worker gave some info to the phone caller then left to do other work. Finally we were greeted and given a 10 minute wait time. Time was accurate. Our drink order was taken immediately, however took a while to return.. I had their signature beer and it was very flat, with very little flavor. I ordered a 2 piece with red beans and rice, side of Mac-n-Cheese. Josie had Breast and a waffle. I have been to the one in phoenix, and do not recall it being as open and loud as this place was. Now, for the chicken. Mine was 2 bites of meat and layers of breading. was hoping for some crisp skin but it was practically burnt. the meat of the chicken once I got to it was very dry. 2 thighs with too much breading and 2 bites of dry meat. I don't recall the waffles being as thin as they were when I had eaten at a different LO-Lo's. Josie's chicken breast was like eating saw dust. I was really hoping to have an awesome review about juicy chicken and flavorful food. The Mac-n-Cheese was just okay. Very cheesy but as for flavor it was sadly lacking. (once again a victim of my own Mac that is quite good) Red beans had flavor however the rice was very undone.   It was very busy here and seemed quite popular. I will admit I am a Vegas boy and not from the south. I would hope, however I would know good chicken when I had it. It was very loud with children about the place being quite noisy. (Parents) ugh!!!. Thank you for Dining at LO-Lo's. I can not say I will go here again. Not with so many more excellent options in Vegas. Maybe you all will have a better experience than we did. I cannot myself recommend going here. As we left there was not a goodbye greeting even though 3 employees standing by door.",

Now maybe it's me but I've NEVER had sweet tea that I had to add sugar to. Since it took that long for drinks, I wanted to see how long it would be for our food, so I put on the timer. It took 30 freaking minutes, but wait we didn't even get to eat. The owner, chef or whomever he was, came out, told us they are not serving food, they have nothing to serve us, that the truck didn't make their delivery today, but yet while he's making the announcement the waitresses are still bringing out drinks. Huh???? In what world does a restaurant run out of food?? We are offered rain checks that they did not have. First and last time there. I see how some businesses to do not last.",

This morning we went for our usual breakfast, and showed up at nine, as soon as they opened. We were sat quickly, and ordered our food right away. We got our drinks in a short about of time, things were going as usual. Then, the time started dragging out. We had been there for almost an hour, and no food yet. I asked for the manager. He came over, didn't apologize, said he would go check on our food. He can back a couple minutes later, told us they were playing our food, again, no apology. 15 minutes later, our food came out and it was cold. The manager did not ever come back to our table to see if everything came out ok. On a positive note, our server did apologize, said they gave her 9 tables to service at the same time. We won't be back...makes me sad. I loved Lolo's :(",

    "text": "To start off I'm from Cali and Vegas food completely sucks! We went to Lolos today for my birthday and it was a horrible experience! We waited about 20 mins for a table which wasn't that bad because we wanted a booth. The waiter took our drink order and took off only to come back 3 more times without our drink. Finally, Everyone gets their drinks (except for me because I ordered a mimosa) the kids get the lemonade and my 14 year old tells me to taste my youngest drink.... one sip and all I could taste were cups of sugar!!  My kids asked to change their drinks because it was too nasty. Finally he comes by to take our order and at that time the power goes out (according to the waiter for the second time)! He tells us he's going to put our order in manually and not to worry. He comes back 45 mins later and realizes we have no food but the people around us who came after us were getting their food. He says something about our order being deleted from the system because of the power outage but he told us he was going to put it in manually.... Maybe he forgot??  WE SAT THERE FOR OVER AN HOUR WITHOUT FOOD AND THE WAITER COMPLETELY AVOIDED COMING IN OUR DIRECTION TO EVEN GIVE US AN UPDATE. My husband flagged down the lady who seated us and asked to speak to a manager and she says it's because the system went down and apologized for the inconvenience. The manager came to speak to us and pretty much gave us the same story and just when we were about to get up and leave our waiter comes to tell us they are plating our food right now. 5 mins later our food comes out and to be honest it was not very good at all. I chose to come here because in Cali we have Roscoes and Lolos was the closes thing to that but the food was honestly horrible. We walked away with plates still full and for our inconvenience our drinks were comped and we were given a 10% discount lol. NEVER AGAIN!",

My husband got tenders and a waffle, I ordered a waffle sandwich with eggs and cheese, and cheese grits. A couple sat down beside of us, they were almost finished eating by the time someone went to check on our food. The corn fritters came out with our meal...40 minutes after we ordered. They were extremely greasy...I know they were deep fried but the oil temp must have been too low because they were saturated. My sandwich came out incorrect, on Texas toast and i said I had ordered a waffle sandwich and was argued with about what I ordered...broke my personal rule and sent it back (does that look like spit to you?) moments later the sandwich contents had been scraped on top of a soggy, lukewarm waffle and returned to me. The grits were inedible. I grew up south of the Mason Dixon line, and if you also grew up in the south, don't bother ordering these. Paula Dean herself would have said too much butter...and no amount of butter or cheese could have salvaged these, a step above wallpaper paste.   My husband fared only slightly better; he never got any syrup or condiments, and had to ask for a fork as his silverware was just a knife. He thought the chicken was okay - he compares all Las Vegas chicken to The Chicken Shack, and it was subpar by that standard. He was also disappointed in his waffle.  Even though we were sitting at the bar, no one checked on us or offered us refills, or asked about our meal. It seemed extremely chaotic and unorganized, and I'm not sure how safe it is to have an electrical cord draped over the bar sink.   Disappointing food, disappointing service, and a wasted Friday night dinner. LoLo's = NoGo",

She let us know that the grits would take 9 mins and we could pick a side. I ordered the lil C, Which comes with grits  And 2 pieces of chicken I got a leg and if I my husband ordered the waffles eggs and grits. So the sides that we ordered was the red beans and rice and I got the smothered potatoes which they were in small side bowls. Chicken was lukewarm when we got it but it was tasty and had great flavor. We were expecting the grits but had to ask for them. Grits come in a container that is barely 1/2 full. It was supposed to be both orders. Icing on my cake, asked for manager who never came out to talk to us. Cook tried to make up for it with a fuller container of grits and a few pieces of fresh chicken. Am I going back? Probably not. Just curious, if he made fresh grits, gave me two tablespoons of it, who were the rest of the grits for? Oh btw, grits were runny watery and probably will taste like shit. Never again Lolo's, never again. Save your money and go to M&M soul food. At least I will get a full order the first time.",

Service was very good. Everybody was friendly, and on the ball.   I loved the fried chicken, crisp, but not overly done so, and not greasy, but the chicken itself was juicy and good. (I ordered the Betty's Boob!) We also got a side of collared greens and green bean/potatoes and shared those. Collared greens were not mush like some places make them, but nice and fresh and a little bit of a zip/zest to them. As were the green beans. My son got himself some fried okra and it was tasty.   Unlike the other heathens posting, I LOVED the cinnamon in the waffles. Made them delish! Granted, I am partial to cinnamon in most things, but I thought it made the waffles very tasty.   We drank some sweet tea, atho, down the road, I plan on getting some koolaid on tap. haha.   All in all good experience.

    "text": "I'm probably beating a dead horse with this review but I need some relief from the disappointment I feel when I think about my visit here on 2/6/2016 - so I'm gonna take it out on the horse.   I heard about the long waits, so I decided to come mid-day to possibly get seated faster. Nope. Took an hour to sit TWO people and a toddler. I knew that I was going to wait no matter what when I arrived and they were frantically writing everyone's name on a notepad like they we're a journalist  jotting down fresh ideas.   After an hour of waiting even though they said it would be 30 minutes we finally get seated. Me and my sister asked the waiter a few simple questions but he didn't know the differences in the combo meals. I felt like I was answering my own questions. (All good, It just opened I understood) but when asked what plates are more filling, he was clueless - that was a question I couldn't answer myself -- but ultimately we made sense of it and ordered.   30 minutes go by and we begin to see people looking just as clueless as to where their order is as we were. The people who started verbally complaining began to get their orders.  I would have jumped on that train if I could've found my waiter. 40 minutes went by before he whizzed past our table and said \"foods coming\" without stopping.  We finally catch him 10 minutes later and ask him \"what's up, man?\" He goes back to the kitchen. Another lady comes and tells us \"It's coming\". Finally after an HOUR the food comes... Freezing COLD. The waffle was soggy and COLD. Fries COLD. Okra COLD. The fish and chicken were the only two somewhat warm items. The chicken appeared to be friend a bit long  but was still good. (Heads up, the chicken is the only positive thing in this review) The catfish was flat out was rubbish. I've had better fish at Golden Corrals buffet. Mind you we are with a toddler who hadn't gotten their food yet. Her plate came out 5 minutes after ours. So I ate cold food with a crying a baby for the first part of the meal. Thanks Lolo's.   Another waiter passed by and asked \"how was everything?\"  -everything was cold  Sir, why didn't you send it back?   - I don't think I could have lasted another hour waiting.  He gave me a look like, \"touche\"  I don't know if I will ever return here, that's something for me and my love for fried chicken to figure out but If I do they will definitely have to wait like they made me wait. So maybe next year. Hopefully they have it together by then.",

I think a competent wait staff and cook line is the minimum in any restaurant. If you were not ready to open you should have changed the opening day of the restaurant!  My husband and I waited for 30 minutes before we were even looked at! I understand being busy, I was also a waitress, so i understand being under pressure and being a bit overwhelmed but to not even get a drink order started?! Come on! I cant review the food because i just walked out. If the wait staff is incompetent, I can only imagine the havoc in the kitchen! NO THANKS!",

Normally I prefer dark meat because it's usually juicier but the dark meat pieces were over cooked. I couldn't even finish the breast because it was so dry.  The service was great. Everyone was super friendly and the music in the background was enjoyable as well. I'm sure if I would have ordered something else, it may have been better, but for a place which has \"chicken\" in the name, I would expect better chicken.",

    "text": "I am not experienced with southern food, so I'm not sure how it's all supposed to taste.  I figure when someone opens a restaurant, they must have had cooking fans for sure!  However, my experience here a couple of times was just mediocre.  The first time I came in (which was not too long after they first opened up), I was excited to try chicken and waffles.  I had never had it before and was anxious to see what the fuss was about.  I ordered not only the chicken and waffles, but got gravy on mine - it seemed like the deluxe way to go.  The problem is, I didn't care for it at all.   The next time, I tried the chicken and waffles without the gravy, wondering if I ruined it the first time and just wasn't a gravy fan.  Again, I didn't really care for the meal.  I didn't like the chicken and I didn't like the waffles either..I like my waffles with a slight crisp to them and these were more like pancakes with waffle shapes.  I also have mixed reviews on the staff as well, but I must say the first time, the staff wasn't all that friendly and the second time, the staff was super friendly.  I will attribute the first time to a bad day and we'll call it good there.  Overall, I guess things are \"OK\" here as the ratings suggest, but I guess I'm just one of those folks that doesn't like chicken and waffles.  Thus for me, it's a mediocre experience and nothing I would get excited about returning for.",

The manager advised that the wait was 45 minutes to an hour - we were seated 2 hours later. The food took another hour to come out. In summary, that's 3 hours of my day wasted. The manager was unprofessional and rude. She wasn't emphatic or personable. Her excuse was that the kitchen was backed up. She actually said \"I'm not going to go back and forth about the wait time.\" (There were plenty of empty seats available). In regards to the food and drinks, we ordered the Cherry Martini, catfish beignets, fried tomatoes, Chyna's wings, chicken strips, and a la carte waffles. The martini was watered down and strangely had 1 ice cube in it. The sugar was very thick and dripping from the rim. The soft drinks were extremely sweet and the chicken strips were dry. The wings and catfish were pretty good, but not good enough for me to wait 3 hours are ever visit this place again. I highly recommend that they hire a new manager and more cooks. Our waiter was nice and professional.  She can learn a lot from her employees.",

We visited the Las Vegas LoLo's on a Sunday and it was quite busy which usually is a good sign. The waitress announced that there were no \"Fresh Egg\" options - so Sunny Side Up or Eggs Over Easy were out of the question. I ordered a Chicken & Waffle Menu Item which included An Egg Scrambled with Onions & Cheese and a small side of Grits. The Chicken was good, hot and plentiful. Everything else was mediocre. The Waffles tasted powdery - my sister said it reminded her of Buckwheat. The Eggs were powdery as well. We were not impressed. In fact, I'm glad this was not my first Lo-Lo's experience. I'll be looking forward to Lo-Lo's again when I return to Phoenix.",

Then the server came, gave us a minute so we can finally decide and after that it took us 45 minutes to get our food.  I lost my patience and my appetite because, That was after she had only checked up on us ONCE within that time frame and only offered one refill for my roommate. I would not have been that mad but the restaurant wasn't even that busy.  Not only did I have to ask another server if our food was backed up, but the manager came and didn't even give me a chance to respond.  It's like the servers and the manager came by to say what they had to say without even checking up on us and then leaving as to not give us a chance to ask for anything.   Not only that but multiple tables that came after us  had gotten their food and drinks/refills before we did.   When I called for one of the servers she kept telling me no before I even asked a question or said anything.   The food was great but it definitely didn't make up for the lack of service,  and the rude employees.  I raised my hand several times just to get the attention of anybody working and nobody came. I'm usually patient at restaurants because I am a part of the restaurant business myself but this type of service was unacceptable.  Finally when we were done eating our server was fast to our attention when dealing with the check as it seemed she wanted to get rid of us as soon as she could. I didn't feel welcomed at all.   I was excited and ready to eat my food but my first experience here was totally ruined, and my roommate and I will not find ourselves coming back.   1/5",

    "text": "Now any place that has chicken and waffles in the name already has a number one fan in me. The restaurant was very well put together, clean, and very cute. I liked the family pictures on the wall, it added a nice touch of soul and provided a more southern feeling.  I'm from Oklahoma so coming to Las Vegas and seeing things like that was very homey for me. Anyways it was the Saturday before Halloween and the place was not crowded AT ALL. We got sat immediately in a comfortable booth. Now I won't lie it took a little bit for us to get addressed by a server but our server (Jael possible?) was so nice and attentive we forgot all about that.    We were recommended by a friend, and she said the chicken and waffles and koolaid were the best. So that's exactly what we ordered. My friend ordered the watermelon koolaid and I ordered the fruit punch and a Tre- Tre with a side of mac and cheese for us to share. They came out in huge mason jars! So delicious. Not exactly like mama makes it but close enough. Whats funny is is that the server said most people cant get through on jar because its so sweet. (she has never met my sweet tooth obviously because I had two). Our food arrived shortly after that (minus the mac and cheese which we actually forgot about when we tasted our food). Man! That waffle was so crispy on the outside but soft and light in the inside. The syrup they gave us just soaked into the waffle perfect. That with the crispyness and saltiness of the drumstick just made my entire night so worth it. I was so engulfed in my chicken and waffles I actually forgot about the mac and cheese until our server brought over two complimentary because we had to wait so long! WOW. After both of our plates were demolished we just sat back and sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction. We kept looking st the menu to see what we were going to order the next time we come. That's how good it was. Superb service, great food at a decent price. (both our meal combined was 22.00). TOTAL THUMBS UP IN MY BOOK!!",

This pass weekend, we drove over 300 miles to eat at this black own establishment and was not impress with the service and lack thereof. Needless to say we did not get to even try the food. When we arrived on 3/16 around 2pm, we wanted to order our food to go. We were quickly told they are not placing take out orders. So I asked, well if we sit down and order our food and ask for togo boxes, can we do that? The girl said, yes and stated we can not sit you for another hour. ??????  There were several sits available at the bar and other areas in the facility. So our group was puzzled, let alone it did make any sense, that we can sit and get togo boxes but can't place a togo order. HUMMMMM.  Half of the people working was in training, which was still puzzling. Why would you have so many people training at one time? Why wasn't their hours staggered to avoid any delays with sitting, eating and providing service to paying customers. Its sad that we try to support our people and they make it very difficult and they wonder why our most of black own establishments does not stay in business for over a year. I am very doubtful that I will ever return back to Lo Lo's. First impression was a bad impression. If this is how you train your employee's and with their lack of customer service, Lo Lo's will not be in business very long.",

    "text": "Well!! I would like to start off by saying this. I myself and my entire family was very disappointed. The service was devil awful we waited at least 30 mins before Nino came over and ask did we order yet. The waitress was new and she was trying; but this establishment was understaffed. When we first walked into the place I notice the greeter. I told my wife wait a minute he looks familiar. I said that's Kevin Johnson who played for the Phoenix Suns. She asked who is that?? because she is not a sports fan. She said no his name said Nino on his work I.d... I said no that's him, that's when I pulled him up on Wikipedia. She said well that is him! My wife asked him; if he would take a picture with my husband, he said in a minute I'll be back. He never came back while he was taking pictures and talking to all the other people. I was like cool I would never ask twice. Hey  I would like to say to the owner of this restaurant , if you brought him in to try to lower more people in there then he made a mistake. You can bring in Micheal Jordan it does not change the quality of food.He should call G Garvin a chef who could actually cook and train people. The waffles taste like Spongebob, Salmon croquettes taste like Goodyear Tires, and you should boil your water with salt which would add flavor with those bland Grits! Grits should have some smooth creamy consistency. 0 stars especially; if you compared them to Roscoes. Customers should also know I went to use the restroom and the cook was in there using the restroom with gloves on and apron at the urinal!! He had two set of gloves on. He took off one pair of gloves and washed his the other gloves W.t.f. How about just taking off the gloves all together man and washing your hands.  Yes we had eaten already if u want to know. I'm not hating just being honest. You need to keep your establishment under the Lo-lo; if this is kept up. Bring in someone experience to manage you establishment. Oh yea that's why you do not idolize people (Mr.Kevin Johnson) except Christ.",

Our server was really sweet and came up to us right away to take our drink orders. We both got the sweet tea and damn it was good. It was so refreshing and cold, it really hit the spot on a hot summer day. I love that the drinks come in mason jars. Besides the sweet tea they have soft drinks and a few different flavors of kool-aid on tap!   My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and I chose the Baby Ray which is 3 pieces of smothered chicken and 2 waffles. I asked for the gravy on the side though because I wanted to taste the chicken and wasn't even sure if I would like the gravy. My friend and I had a chance to catch up and after maybe ten minutes or so, our food came out. My food was delicious. I didn't think the chicken was greasy at all and it was very tasty. The skin was crispy, and salty with just the right amount of seasoning. The waffles were good too, large in size and a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter. I enjoyed eating the chicken with the waffles and syrup, but I also liked dipping the chicken into the gravy, it was pretty good. My friend enjoyed her meal but said the grits needed salt.   For dessert we got the banana pudding to share and it looked great, but I didn't care for it. It had a weird aftertaste and I wouldn't order it again. For both of our meals, drinks and dessert it was almost $50 which is a bit pricey for lunch, but because the food and service were good I would come back.",

However, the wait to get our food is always a bit long (which really isn't a problem because the food is always hot, which leads me to believe at least it's been cooked). The issue I've had both times is, the delivery of our entire order is never served all together. We ordered 1 meal to split. The KKs is 2 waffles, 3 pieces of chicken, grits, eggs, & gravy. My husband wanted the gravy on the side & I wanted an extra leg of chicken. My husband ordered coffee & we both ordered water. Pretty easy right? Wrong.  1st visit, my husband never received his coffee. They took it off of the ticket & gave him his coffee for free. 2nd visit, he had to ask for his coffee a few times before he received it.   The food order was a struggle to receive. Both visits we received our chicken & waffles but had to wait on everything else. The waitress said, \"You're sides are coming.\" I asked for more butter & syrup. We waited 10 minutes & another waitress brought our grits & eggs but not my extra piece of chicken. I asked the other waitress for my extra chicken, syrup & butter because the 1st waitress never brought that.  I'm guessing the way the servers deliver orders is acceptable here but I don't like it. I like my entire order to be delivered at the same time at the same temperature. I told my husband I would not like to come back but he wants to give them one more chance. 3xs a charm.....I guess. LOL",

The staff were all well mannered .Demetria started us off with an amazingly big mason jar of cherry kool-aid, I was in aww already .Flavor was spot on, not too sweet and not sour it was perfect,literally .NOW, let's get to the food,  the Red Velvet pancakes were amazing !!! Light and fluffy and overall satisfying ,with cream cheese frosting ,need I say more . The hot links were just that , Hot Links, juicy with just the right amount of spices . My friend ordered the KK's special and it looked amazing . Came with two waffles ,fried chicken ,grits and scrambled eggs with onions and cheddar cheese . Can you say fulfilling . This place was great and I would be surprised  if it didn't last . They are here to stay and their food is a loud statement of that !!!! I will be visiting again! !",

I might have tried a few more drinks, but the prices seemed a little high (3.50) this is Vegas. The sweet tea is in a large mason jar, not to sweet. The chicken skin was very crispy, no big flavor rush, but juicy. The waffles have a cake like taste and texture, I'm taking mine home and putting them in the toaster oven. The eggs and grits were well cooked. Everything was on the table for you to make them your own. I tried the shrimp and grits with mushrooms and crispy bacon. I really enjoyed it, but it needed flavor, a little seasoning would have gone a long way or maybe a tasty sauce. The greens were not bitter. I'll have to try more sides I only tasted a little of the greens. Nice large biscuits and corn bread. The banana pudding looked amazing so we took two home. If you are going to do this order it at the table and pack it yourself, the one they pack is much smaller than the gorgeous one they put on the table and it should be half the price. They forgot to put the pudding in mine, so I had vanilla wafers, which are not my thing, with bananas and whipped cream. My Son had pudding in his and said it was really good. He said amazing, but I think it was because I couldn't taste it. I'll try them again, the people were really nice and everyone helped each other to make sure you were happy.",

The catfish was mediocre.. the chicken in the supposed \"award winning\" phat azz samwich was gross, it was just a chicken breast dipped like 4 times in cornmeal.. nothing mind blowing about it. The fries.. mediocre as well the sweet tea sucked and the service was so bad I didn't leave a tip. Considering there is chicken in the name of this place... you would think you could safely assume that everything chicken would be at least decent... not the case here... it was such a disappointment. Save your money go to Raising  Canes and make your own waffle at home..",

    "text": "My husband loves chicken wings so we decided to try Lolos. We went on a Sunday afternoon and they were packed, we had about a 20 minute wait. I am not a huge fried chicken fan but decided to try the chicken wings and waffle. I absolutely loved them, the chicken wings were delicious, seasoned well and cooked perfectly, the waffle was good also (and yes, they are as good as Roscoes). My husband, the wing aficionado, loved the wings. I also had a side of cheese grits, they were loaded with cheese, but good. Topped it off with homemade lemonade and sweet tea made just how we like it. For dessert we shared peach cobbler, we didn't care for the peach cobbler, the \"crust\" was more like bread with an odd taste, and a corner of it was cold.  Service was good, our waitress was on point with all our requests. With that said, we will be back!  Well I have been back a few times and I have been disappointed each time. The grits.... Are bland and sticky and just not good anymore, I stopped ordering them. The waffles have not been the same either the last time I had them they tasted like a cup of cinnamon was mixed in the batter. Good thing the wings have been tasty, but Lolos is just not my first choice anymore. Also, the last time we were there it took about 30 minutes to receive our food. Food and service is not consistent, back to Roscoes I go!",

Their sweet tea is very good as well! I really like it the mason jars that it came in they were large. My boyfriend got the entree platter with chicken gizzards, catfish nuggets, and fried green tomatoes. They platter was good well seasoned and large. The chicken gizzards were delicious and huge! We also had mojitos and mimosas and they were good as well! Overall I'd give it a 3, and I'd eat there again.",

Actually I ordered Apple the green Kool-Aid but they didn't have it. We all just tried different items to get a feel for the menu. We really enjoyed everything we had. Chicken was good but not fabulous. Missing some seasoning to me. But it was cooked to perfection!  My husband was very happy with the bill family of four under $50. It never happens!

    "text": "Came in on a Sunday afternoon. As expected it was kinda busy, not slammed. We ordered 2 muddy waters which came right away then we preceeded to wait for our food for 45 mins or so. Which is again, to be expected.  We ordered the Malaysia burger, medium well, with jalapeno mayo and an over easy egg. We also ordered the sammich and opted for catfish.  Let me start by saying our waitress never asked how our food was. Maybe because she knew my burger was cold, with a fried hard egg , and a medium rare cook. I was extremely disappointed. My hubby's fish sammich on the other hand was piping hot, and delicious.  Our server did not ask how our food was, or if we needed anything. We have ordered before and asked for it to go. I think we will stick with that In the future , the employees seemed to be more concerned about the football games than anything else.  I am still giving 3 stars because one bad experience is not enough for me to be too dissapointed.",

I never complain (7 years in food service) but had to send them back. Second set of chicken, and the skin was separated from the meat cause the meat was so dry. I couldn't eat either.   Kids loved the pancakes, and the sweet tea and kool-aid were great or else I'd give this a 1 star.",

With family from Los Angeles, I have eaten the famous Roscoos Chicken and waffles and heard about this place and thought I would give it a try with a  friend. We ordered The KK and split it. The chicken and waffles were better than Roscos overall. The place is a little pricey and there is a $3 up charge to have one piece of white meat instead of all dark meat on the combo? The food was good but the Grits were terrible and so was the service. Slow to refill my drink and to take my order. a couple changes and they could get 4 or 5 stars.",

I heard bad things about the service especially and we came in at a slow time so the service wasnt bad, but they still could have come by to check on us a little more since it was slow and they did not. I guess nothing wrong with trying this place as I have passed by many times. It is decent and will come back again, but I will be in absolutely no hurry to do so. Sweet tea is pretty good",

I will say when they first opened the service was not that great and they were not organized, but each time we have been back the service has improved. The food is always great and the portions are right in line with their pricing. I always get the Betty's boob and it breast portion is always a DD breast size...lol. Their bathroom is always clean as is their restaurant. My only critique is the greeters could be more friendly they seem like they are never in a good mood when we come in.   The last time we were there, my husband mentioned that it was our daughter's birthday and the server and some other staff member's came and sang to her and gave her a free slice of cake. That to me is great customer service!",

You cannot call in abead thats one downfall i think. The other con is how loud the music is, i wiuld understand if it was after yom but at 10qm having club music blaring can be a bit much. The waffle is so amazing  it is a must try, just like the greens mac and cheese fried okra and lemonaid omg so good. The way they make their cheese eggs and grits is wow.. i never had grits bur these bad boys are off the chain. Buscuts and gravy  was good but they deff need to not be so skiny with the gravy. If you wanr the rest of your dri k to go it costs you$1. Sometimes the wait can be to long. If you went to lolo in the past and didnt like ot try it again, its by new ownership now. Thre stars due to the wait times,  ot sure why they have people waiti g so lo g at times when they have so many open tables, the loud music is a bit much, the fzct you have to buy your to go cup and the gravy o  a biscuits  seriouskyit left 5he biscuits  dry. But the flavor the staff make up for it to give it 4 stars",

    "text": "I was excited to see that there was a Lo Lo's here in Las Vegas (I'd discovered then in Phoenix). Was out with the family and decided to take everyone and introduce the wife and kids to the amazing food.  Just before noon we arrived. Lots of people already there, but we got on the list and were given the estimate of 25-30 mins.  After 45 mins, I checked the link they'd sent to my phone. Turns out that takes you to yelp, which tracks your place on line.  My app said there were 16 parties ahead of us.  After 45 mins, we'd only moved up two spots.  I'd been sitting inside and went inside again to ask and noticed that everyone who'd arrived before us was already seated.  The girls at the front told me that I had another 5 mins or so.  I went and informed the family.  I went back inside to observe and noticed that there were more than 20 open tables around the place (heavily understaffed).  Then, I noticed that they began seating people who had arrived long after we had.  I asked again what was going on and was told that I was looking at another 30 minutes at a minimum.  We'd already been waiting for over an hour!  I watched them again seat people, without even trying to hide it, who had just come in.  I'm so angry. We were polite there and didn't raise a stink about it, but their business practices are disgusting and we'll not be back.  I looked for their manager, but couldn't find him/her. Finally, after spending 1 hour and 45 minutes too long of our lives there, we left.  I hate crappy businesses.",

The server Drei took our order and we never saw her again until we asked for the check. The bus boy was incredible. He brought out the food (brought out the over easy eggs they forgot which turned out to be over cooked and other condiments needed), brought our drinks and provided refills, and was super apologetic and polite!

We walked in and it was pretty busy but got seated very fast bc it was just 2 of us. So after we were seated not one person came over to us to take our drink order we wanted for more than 10 mins as people walked past us and I watched as others were being seated and waited on but not us, finally someone stoped and asked us if we had been waited in and we ofcouse said no. Right in front of us was our waitress running around waiting on everyone else but us, and the guy that asked us if we had been waited on asked the girl right in front of us if we had been waited on he asked her to get our order and she said yes she, she just walked away and never came back.   no drinks and still no food.  We people sat there a total of 45 mins or so and nothing so we got up and left. So this is why I will not ever be going back to a place that treats others like this, I do not care how good the food could have been if the service is not good then the food will be just as bad. So No thank you I will not be eating at this place ever.",

It took over 20 minutes before our drink order was taken we wanted to give our food order but was told she wasn't the person to do that. Another 10 minutes someone came to take out food order. It took 40 minutes before our food came out. 1......plate.....at...a......time. Why did I bother to come with someone, it's not like we got to eat together. Our check was delivered quick with the last plate but change, come on now, wouldn't want to mess up there flow would we???? And still this the place didn't get full. It wasn't just our table either. No one got their meals together. Your chicken came out then 20 minutes later your friends pancakes. 10 after that your mashed potatoes might come.  Really? I asked what the issue was and I was told the cook called out today. Looking at the other reviews, I think the cook calls out a lot. Don't waste your time, if you want to spend hours eating lunch go to some place that has the atmosphere to look at or maybe a live band for some kind of entertainment. It was awful",

It was actually a 72 minute wait. I did like that once you checked in they texted you when your table was ready. Once we were seated we were greeted immediately and given drinks. The Koolaid was great. We ordered and the waiting began. I had to ask the waiter do you know how long for our food? He said it should be out shortly and when he came back he brought the food that was about 50 minutes after we ordered. I ordered #3. LoLo's the chicken was seasoned well. The waffle was ok I prefer a crunchy waffle this one has kinda soft. My hubby ordered the Soulfood platter with 2 pieces of fried catfish, cornbread, fried okra, and Mac cheese. He liked the fish. I thought it was too Fishy. The cornbread was ok and the Mac and cheese was soupy. The okra was good. My daughter ordered the shrimp and Mac cheese. I must say this was very tasty.  The service was just subpar I had to request a fork several times from the waiter since I dropped mine. I also requested and extra plate which I never got. Also we were not offered to order dessert. Overall I would probably not return. It wasn't a great impression.",

The host didn't give a shit about us, she had an attitude, she didn't recognize us upon arrival and didn't notice we were standing in line to put our names in. She actually looked past us and greet other customers who were arriving. The mimosas were way over priced. I paid $7.50 for a large mimosa and she gave me a medium drink in a large glass. The medium mimosa $4.50 and it's just as much as a large. So that was a rip off. Before we were even seated, I asked the host if we can sit at the bar and she says yes but you have to buy a drink and I said ok. As we were sitting down at the bar, a waitress says we can't sit there because it's not to drink or eat there, I was really confused.  I probably will never go to lolos chicken just because of the service, not to mention there were tons of open seating and nobody could be seated in them. You'll never get that issue at roscoes chicken and waffles the real chicken a waffles. It's only a matter of time lolos chicken will be going out of business if they don't fix the issue and fast.",

Anyway I went in after noon to celebrate my BIRTHDAY on May 7th around 2pm and I had the BEST server named Krystal (I believe) and all of the other ladies assisting her (Sonya was one) were great as well.   The Food... I ordered the chicken & waffle meal that comes w/ 3 pieces of meat, scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese & onions and grits. It was yummy prepared just right! The atmosphere was good and I enjoyed the music. Boy did I miss \"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles!\"  One request....  I asked to speak to the manager upon entering the restaurant. He was sitting in a booth by the bar talking with someone. I just wanted to say it was my BIRTHDAY, how I MISSED eating at Lo-Lo's and I was hoping for a great experience at this location.  Guess what? He NEVER came over to my table!  He didn't even walk around the restaurant like some managers do to check on their guest. I was really surprised that he didn't come to my table especially since I asked the young lady/Hostess at the front as soon as I walked in. Did SHE tell him? Did HE forget or what? Neither one of them knew WHY I asked to speak to management. SMH!   In conclusion ....  The wait staff (ladies) sung \"Happy Birthday\" to me and made my day with such GREAT service they provided. I applaud the wait staff! You ladies ROCKED!   I first gave 5 stars and changed it to 4 stars due to the Manager not coming over to the table to address my need. Will I return?  HECK YEAH but maybe I'll get on the road and travel to the Scottsdale location since I'm not too far.",

    "text": "OMG.  Let me just say I've been to some good soul food places back home on the East coast. But Lo Lo's is on a whole 'nother level.  Before my friends and I left for our Vegas trip, I found this place via a travel site called Travel Noire. They featured Lo Lo's in an article they wrote about best places to visit in Las Vegas. They offered chicken and waffles and we're fans of those. Sold.   We arrived at the restaurant which kind of blends in with the shopping center it's in, right across a few fast food restaurants. Small parking lot but not too crazy. We entered those double doors to the hostess and was told there was a 30 minute wait. Ok. Sat at the bar while we waited and once we got to our seats, we were accommodated by Shanika (I hope I got that name right). She seemed a little rough on the edges at first but deep down we knew she was a bit stressed because she was one of the few waitresses serving (hence our wait, which is understandable). She softened up later and was helpful with us throughout. My one friend has an allergy to gluten and when confronted with the problem, Shanika went straight to the chef and he came out and told my friend they would make her a special dish, whatever she wanted, gluten-free style. We were such in awe!  The menu is vast but many reasonably priced items. All of the items have nicknames but I stuck to the three piece chicken with a double side of fries and cornbread deal (forgot the name). Along with that was a Georgia on my Mind drink. When I got those items, INSTANTLY I was in LOVE! The chicken was cooked to perfection, the flavor was awesome, the fries were seasoned right and that drink - yesss! A nice balance where I can taste the alcohol (peach Vodka) and sweetness. The only gripe I had was the cornbread, unfortunately. It wasn't buttery moist like I'd hope and not a lot of flavor. The other food overrode that and I was happy.  Two of my other friends also had chicken meals with the Lo Lo's Punch which they loved as well and they tried a sip of my drink and they ordered that drink for themselves too! My gluten-free friend received grilled chicken tenders and fries, no alcoholic drink though, and she loved it all!   Thus later in our trip, we took another venture to Lo Lo's and this time it was a 45 minute wait due to a big party. We rode around a bit during our wait, came back and everything was settled. This time, I ordered the Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles with a cup of coffee. Of course, the chicken was consistently great. Those waffles are waffles I've never had before. I'm not even joking. I could taste the nutmeg, cinnamon and butter in every bite and the syrup just intensified it. True down-home cooking in this restaurant.  My gluten-free friend got grilled shrimp and my other two friends got shrimp and grits and the three chicken with sides deal. Everyone loved their meals too. One of my friends got the Blue Ivy drink which after I took a sip, it tasted like a Freeze-Pop, Squeeze-Pop whatever you want to call it (you know, those frozen flavored ice treats in the plastic tube that you have to squeeze up?) - scarily sweet without a hint of alcohol! My friend felt the vodka after about 20 minutes lol. Our waitress - whose name starts with an L, ohhh so sorry I forgot - was pleasant and helped us out with everything we needed as well.  All I know is, the next time I visit Las Vegas or even Arizona, I'm going back to Lo Lo's! I miss it so much lol.",

Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but it is sooooooo worth it!! Get the soul food platter cause you get a lot of food for not a hefty price. Their dirty rice is so delicious and the chicken is always crunchy and yummy. The banana pudding is literally the best I've ever had. We will keep coming back, that's for sure!! Thank You Lo-Lo's you never disappoint. Ever!!!!!",

I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the Lil Amadi. 2 pieces of fried chicken and waffles! It was delicious! Service was quick and Bree Bree, my waitress, was so nice!  It didn't take long before the food came. The chicken was crispy and juicy! Tad bit on the hot (temperature wise) side, almost burnt my fingers. The LoLo's Chicken & Waffles hot sauce was pretty good, it reminded me of the Louisiana brand hot sauce. The waffle was ok, not as good as the Waffle House but better than Roscoe's.   There was a server named Nino in there that reminded me of the NBA Great, Kevin Johnson!  If I don't return here before I leave, this will be one of my Las Vegas stops in the future!",

This was the happening food spot in Vegas. The chicken was sooooo super good, waffles fluffy (jus ask for more butter and syrup from the jump before your waffles get cold). My mom had the Uncle Brther's shrimp and grits and did not like it at all. The fried green tomatoes weren't all that good either; they were too ripe and the batter was thick, didn't taste homemade. After taking one bite we asked if we could return them and was told no. Unfortunately our server seemed very irritated and did not provide us with good service at all. She kept messing up on our order and bringing things extremely late. I won't count this against the restaurant because I heard that's not normal. Next time you're in Vegas try them out.",

In my mind I was just picturing it to be like Roscoe's (which I did not understand the hype and hated going to it because I did not like waiting over an hour to be seated), but to my surprise was better than I imagined.  The menu is fun. My sister and I sat there laughing at all the clever names that they named their dishes. My boyfriend ordered the DD (not pronounced Dee Dee but Double D), two chicken breasts with a waffle. Hilarious! I ordered the Little C, the smaller version. =P  The sweet tea and water are served in Mason jars, which I loved! Our waitress Karen was very friendly and provided great service. Peaches, the hostess was hilarious and quite entertaining. They made it a quite pleasant experience.",

I went and asked the nearest waiter can we please get service and she said someone will be there shortly. Waited another 10 min then I went to the bar and asked the bartender can I speak to the manager. The manager came out and I knew he wasn't the real manager and he said they have a health inspector here for inspection. One of the other customers that was there said she was waiting a hour and came up to complain also. The so called manager said I can take your order right now. I told him I've been waiting literally 40 min and I don't want anything from here I just wanted to let you guys know this isn't the way to conduct business. The health inspector should've come at another time or later during the day. The place wasn't even packed. If they would have said we have a health inspector here from the jump so services could be a little slow I would've understood but, they didn't say anything. I will never go back again. So we went to Applebees instead with another customer who was complaining about how slow it was.",

In the past I've always been sat in a decent time frame and served within reasonable time as well...HOWEVER the last two times have been ridiculous ... today for example , Walking in today I was so excited and ready to eat , there was about 2 people on the wait list in front of me yet was sat 30 min later ....After bruh seated I ordered a mimosa and a berry boob , while my brother ordered Kool-Aid and a DD With two sides of corn bread... the waitress did not check up on us at all, an hour went by and I actually got up and asked a different waitress for some help as we had been siting in the resurgent for over an HOUR and not even our drinks had even served to us. A few minutes later the food came out and we were brought water . We never got the corn bread or the mimosa so once AGAIN I had to go hunt down a different waitress for help. It makes me really upset because I always refer people here and talk this restaurant up so much , and to be \"forgotten\" and have to continuously ask for my food was so irritating, I will no longer be recommending this place to anyone .",

We walked in and we were immediately greeted with kindness and a smile so we figured so far, so good. Boy, were we wrong.  The place is huge to start off (not a bad thing particularly, but it's intimidating), we were sat down and a few minutes go by, our waitress finally comes up to the table. As kind a woman as she seemed to be, she also seemed exhausted like she didn't want to be there anymore. She takes our drinks down, another good few minutes go by and we finally get them. Mine was just an ice water and my boyfriend had gotten tea of some kind. She asks if we're ready to order and we say yes, I had gotten the pecan salad (I believe) and he had ordered a medium rare burger. We wait, and wait, and wait some more, finally about 40 minutes go by and out comes out food.  Except our waitress was gone. She had left in the middle of our dining in and gone home. Maybe it's just me, but who does that? Don't they at least finish off a table they have beforehand? Or at least stop by to tell us someone else will be serving us?  The chicken in my salad was dry and old, as though it had been left out for days before being used, I found a HAIR in my food, and there was no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriends burger came out rare, nearly raw and inedible. The guy who took over never came by to refill our drinks- or at least waited until the glasses were completely empty and ice was at a quarter mark on the cups. And to top it all off, he gave us the WRONG bill for another table that was at least 100+$! Pay attention to the table your serving so they don't have a damn heart attack over this stuff! When we got our actual bill it for 30-40$ for crappy food. We ran away and will never, ever, come back. Stay away from this place!",

    "text": "A chicken and waffle place? Based out of Arizona? I know what you're thinking. \"Dont knock it til you try it\" right?   So I come in on a thursday night about 7:15. Place was not all that busy but enough for the the staff to stay busy. We got a table right away which should be expected for the restaurant was only half full.  As I go over the menu I see that a lot of the food names are in relation to \"Da Hood\". Things like Baby Ray, Betty's Boob, and Tre-Tre's. That's for the chicken choices. I find it funny because when you're in \"Da Hood\", good food usually does not cost an arm and a leg. And it tastes good. What im saying is the food here does not taste good at all. Compared to Roscoe's Lo Lo's chicken does not have as much flavor.  So what I got was the Sheeda's Special ($11) and Fried Okra ($4) and Home Fries ($4). The Sheeda's Special was a chicken breast and wing along with a waffle. The chicken was bland and extra greasy, like they were in a hurry to serve it and didnt really give it enough time for the grease to drain properly. The waffle was plain bad. It was soggy and you can taste some cinnamon mixed into it. Putting a lot of syrup on it almost made it taste ok. Since thats all you get for the Sheeda's Special, I opted to get a the side of fried okra and home fries. The okra was soggy and literally had grease dripping from it. I guess it was the same person who pulled it out of the fryer and didnt give it enough time to drain? The fried okra at Dickey's barbeque was way better. The home fries were tasteless. The only thing I could taste was the onions and green peppers that were cooked with it. The potatoes were dry.  Service was almost non existent. I think I only interacted with my server twice. Once for taking the my order and then the second time bringing out my food. I take that back. Actually 3 times but the 3rd time didnt really count. The iced tea that she gave me literally looked like mud. I took a sip and I swear I could taste tea grounds. So I had her change it out for a diet soda.  Some things I wanna mention. One of the servers there look like they could be a Jonas brother. Only this guy was cut. You guys should take a pic with him and say he was helping out at Lo Lo's that day. After I ordered I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and they were out of paper towels so I mentioned it to one of the servers. After we got done eating about an hour later, I went to wash my hands again and STILL no paper towels. Fail.  Overall, this place is way overpriced, overhyped, and the service is terrible. I am definitely not coming back. On a side note if you want really good chicken and fried catfish, go check out Sunny's Chicken and Fish over towards North Las Vegas off of Lamb and Washington. You can get a 2 piece breast and wing with waffle for $3.99! For the price of a Sheeda's Special you can almost get 3 orders at Sunny's! His chicken and fried catfish taste way better and it is what I use to compare other chicken/waffle/catfish places! Plus the location is actually in a \"hood\" part of town so Lo Lo's got nuthin on this place! Sunny's is probably the best kept secret in regards to great chicken and catfish. If you go, tell him Roger sent you! Matter of fact, I had to go there the very next day just to get over the bad experience at Lo Lo's! I dont usually mention other restaurants in my reviews but in this case I feel bad that you guys are missing out if you havnt been to Sunny's! Plus your wallet will thank you!

From the beginning, the host was nice and greeted us with a smile. Once we got seated, our waiter came to take our order and introduced the promotion. We were pleased with his great humor and energy while talking to us. We got the chicken and waffle and chicken with Mac and Cheese. Ohhhhh my goodness!!!! The seasoning on the chicken was spot on amazing! The salty seasoning with the sweet warm syrup and waffle couldn't be anymore perfect. It's a must have together! The Mac N Cheese was creamy and flavorful. I loved it!! We ordered a side of rice & gravy + fried okra. The fried okra was perfectly fried. Not greasy at all and perfect amount of breading!! The manager went around to greet all of us. I love the energy and the friendly environment. Can't wait to bring people here with us next time. Hope this post helped! Cheers to FRIED FRIDAYS!!!",

    "text": "Ooh la la, Lo-Lo's Chicken is da best in the west! Actually, this restaurant is located in The Best of the West shopping center, near McDonald's.  Been wanting to try it, but place is pretty busy on weekends. So, we checked it out for an early lunch on Friday and got right in.  There were waves of patrons in and out of the lower dining area, but the bar area with the pub tables seem to have availability so we'll keep that in mind, too.  Nice open feel to the building, wood-look floors, red leather booths, and vintage touches with bold art pieces.   Our server Chevy was friendly and happy to answer our many questions.  We decided to be initiated with the standards--chicken and waffles, with sides of dirty rice and gravy with onions, washed down with unsweetened southern tea and half&half tea.  BF and I both loved the hot chicken, well seasoned and crunchy fried exterior, tender juicy meat.   Super large chicken pieces, too.  (Note to smaller appetites, go with the Lil Amadi or risk lugging around a doggy bag after lunch.)  We both had never tried chicken and waffles before and didn't quite understand the fuss, but we do now!  Buttered, soft waffles with maple syrup make the perfect base for a piece of crispy chicken. A fork full of a delish, unexpected combination.   Oh, why did we wait so long to discover this? Now we have to make up for lost time.  The dirty rice is made with gizzards, so if you're used to Popeye's dirty rice, you'll be put off.  It's a bit on the dry side, so be warned.  The gravy is the red gravy and was topped with a few slices of nearly raw onions, not my favorite.  Just glad they did the chicken and waffles well!  Planning to try other selections next time as the menu was fairly extensive.  I know it's a chain restaurant,  but it celt.loke a local diner.  Glad it's in Vegas.",

Only ok thing was my potatoes. My boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles and his chicken was way over seasoned and he could taste remanence of catfish - if he had fish allergy this is very serious. Waitress was rude and you could tell she had a problem. Will not be returning. Unfortunate because it had so much potential had it been fresh.",

    "text": "I heard the food was good. It smelled good as it was being served to others all around us. What I'm trying to say is, we were never served!!! My husband and I went in earlier this week 2/9/16 and sat by the bar and took about 5 minutes to read through a menu that made our mouths water. We placed our order with a waitress that was fairly pleasant and brought us our water. My husband and I got into a heated discussion that distracted us from the fact that 20 minutes rolled by and no food. When I checked the time and realized its been 20 minutes since we ordered we started really observing food coming in and out of the kitchen but nothing to our table. We also counted and realized there were 4 different groups of people that came in after us and they got their food. Finally the waitress comes by and says that they were frying my catfish and wanted to make sure it was done right. Come on now! Catfish don't take that long!!! After waiting for 40 minutes total we decided to get up and leave. As we walked towards the door a lady(employee) ran up to us saying no no don't leave yet! She grabbed my husband's shoulder and my arm (highly inappropriate) to stop us from walking out. She said something like please don't leave I'm sorry I will get your check.  I'm assuming she meant she'd comp the meal for being incompetent. I calmly said we were done and my husband and I walked out.  A. Who was she?  B. Where did she come from?  C. If she knew there was an issue with our meals why didn't she come to our table to address it before?  Bad service!!! Terrible! They weren't even busy enough to justify that faux pad!!!  Too bad! I had high hopes for this place since It opened up down the street from my home. By the way I gave it 1 star because the water was refreshing.",

We were sat and gave our order to our server Chevy, she was very nice and friendly. Waiting about 20 minutes, still no drinks. Our server comes and says it'll be another 15-20 mins for food, we say it's fine but can we at least have our drinks lol we watched a couple of tables get their food at about 10-15 mins after their order, so we think our server forgot. A food runner comes to our table and brings food we didn't order, it was for the next table. At this point we just think it's really funny no one seems to know what they're doing. Of course they've been opened for only a week so we just laugh it off. About 10 minutes go by and our server comes again saying everything's coming should be just a few more minutes. Finally maybe after 50 minutes we get our food. We ordered 3 plates of chicken and waffles, cornbread, mac and cheese, pineapple upside down pancakes, and the corn fritters. We got everything together except the corn fritters. We asked the server and she said they should be coming, she forgot again lol those were supposed to be starters but it came last, when we were almost done. The chicken is delicious! Throw some hot sauce and honey on it and you're good to go! Oh yeah the server only wanted to give us one side of honey? We asked if we have to pay for another side and she didn't seem to know so we just settled for the one side she gave us lol anyway, the waffle I didn't like so much, as other reviews say, it's quite soggy. It really is more like a pancake. It's weird how soggy it was. Mac and cheese was ok. The corn bread was a bit hard but the inside was ok. The pineapple upside down pancake wasn't worth the $13. The corn fritters were great! Crunchy and creamy and sweet and spicy all in one bite! I would come back to have some chicken and those corn fritters! I'm hoping their service will get better, they were friendly, just forgetful and confused lol",

Two pieces of chicken hot enough to have just been cooked, the beans and rice side dish was hot but disappointing. In a small dish sat a mound of white rice topped with a tablespoon of beans, no sauce no substance. The mac 'n cheese was lukewarm, at best, not freshly prepared and lacking any distinguishing flavours. I had to put ground centuries ago black pepper on it. The watermelon koolaide in a large mason jar was refreshing, would have preferred cherry but they don't have that either( no liquor license). Ambience? None unless screaming kids is your thing while eating and paying $15 for lunch. Not mine. A no no for me.",

Once I let them know how many people were in my party  (12) two of the employees tried to discourage us from staying. Then told me it would be a very long wait.  One employee stated that parties of 8 or more will not be seated together and if we did we could only order certain things off the menu. To my surprise I asked why? She stated because anything that was not number 1-16 would back the kitchen up. My first thoughts was were not eating here, but it was my nephew's birthday so we waited it out.  After a 45 minute wait and many empty tables we were seated.  It took 10 minutes after we were seating for our waitress to even acknowledge us. Once we did order she told us they didn't have any alcohol which was clearly advertised on the menu. When our food came out she forgot two of our orders. Then two of the orders were completely wrong. The food was okay nothing spectacular. The pancakes were very dry and the sausages were under cooked. The shrimp and grits was good,  but greasy. Maybe things will get better after a couple months of them being open, but I will not be back.",

    "text": "Tried them for the first time about a week ago and absolutely loved the place. The food and service were great and I knew I'd be back. However, my experience this week was a nightmare. The wait to be seated was shorter than expected for the lunch hour, about 15-20 minutes. Once seated it was 15+ minutes before anyone took my drink order and that was only AFTER I went and notified the hostess I was still waiting. My server (props to her, Misty, she was awesome) came and apologized and explained she had several tables inside and no one informed her that they had sat customers in her section outside. She took my order and went about her business checking on our party multiple times. Misty explained that the kitchen was slightly backed up because they had gone to the full menu this week and the kitchen couldn't keep up. After about 30-45 minutes of waiting for our meal, I asked Misty to bring me the manager...all of them, because this was ridiculous. The manager, pleasant lady named Barbara-jean came and apologized and restated what Misty had said multiple times, and that she would personally go check on our meal. About 10 minutes later the food arrives, waffles so cold the butter wasn't melting and the chicken, apparently, had been fried for an hour...YESTERDAY! It was burned beyond recognition and no where near edible. I was promptly brought \"fresh\" chicken and guess what, a piece of it was worse than the first plate. I get new restaurants have their issues but what happened here goes beyond unacceptable! I'll give them one more shot maybe in about a month, if they are still in business, but only because of the way Misty and Barbara-jean handled things, and memories of my first visit.",

The southern style Mac and cheese was good as well.   The wait times are ridiculous!! I had read all the other complaints and I was hoping they'd get it together by now, but no!! We waited about 30 min for 3 dishes. I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon flavored waffle since I don't feel it goes with the chicken. I'm not sure if the bad service and disorganization is due to it being a new restaurant, but it needs improvement. Lastly, I ordered a side of rice with gravy and my white rice was hard like if it had been sitting out for a while.   If I do return, I think I'll wait a few months or until I see the reviews improve.",

    "text": "My charge nurse recommended this place since I live about 10 minutes away from it and that her family just loves Chicken and Waffles. So I tried going on a Wednesday after my night shift and to my dismay found out they open at 9. I got there at 8:30 and wasn't planning on staying for another 30 minutes since I'm already sleepy. So I gave it another go on Friday.  The place was roomy. It has a bar on the middle which was pretty spacious. Multiple screen TVs where you can get your sports on if you happen to fancy eating waffles and drinking beer at the same time while watching the Olympics. I was seated on a booth (to my surprise) and the place wasn't as busy when I went (which was good).   I forgot the servers name but he was really nice. He looked like he had a busy morning because even with only two customers he was huffing and puffing. The menu had plenty to offer. Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner or a combination of the two or three if you wish. I went ahead and ordered Lolo's Chicken and Waffles since well that's what I came for. I saw from reviews that they also liked the Banana Pudding so I ordered that one too.  On to the food. The Waffles were soft, a hint of Cinnamon is there but not overpowering. The butter they served with it was perfect and just made me smile seeing that gold turn to liquid (yeah I'm a fat ***). To my surprise it was the chef that served the food to me! I mean I'm sorry if I put everybody on an inconvenience by going there for lunch. Either that or he was just happy to serve the food he made. But he looked really nervous for some reason. I don't bite. Well not unless your food that is *wink*. So he told me he'd be back with syrup and yes he did. The syrup was warm and went perfectly with the waffles. It was good but I was never really into waffles or had not had too many growing up so there wasn't really anything for me to compare it too. But the taste was just right. There wasn't any after taste or anything that you would usually get if the batter came from a box. And no I'm not saying it came from a box. I'm just saying the ones that come from a box have aftertaste is all. I know very well they make theirs from scratch. Which is a good thing.  The chicken!!! Okay so I'm a big fan of fried chicken. And growing up having been a patron of another restaurant I have a lot to say about Lolo's fried chicken. First of all they are big! As in it looks like they gave me the whole chicken with the three piece I got. All that was missing was the head. The portion is good for someone who's about ready to eat a horse but I believe I ordered too much for my appetite this time around. The skin was crispy but needs a little salting on some parts of the chicken. The taste didn't overpower the waffles and actually went great with them. The meat was tender and became very addicting as I dug through and through. It didn't compare to previous ones that I've had but it paired nicely with the soft waffles they made. But like I said it was just way too much for my appetite this time around and actually had to take some to go (and my fat *** always finishes a plate). That's just how much their servings are.  The banana pudding then comes around and the presentation was really nice. It was served on a Mason Jar with whipped cream on top with tiny butter cookies. It wasn't too sweet and kind of reminds me of bread pudding and was wondering whether the banana is mixed in the pudding or was it just the banana slices that were giving the taste. In my opinion it needed more banana slices. I just had way too much food to start off with so I wasn't able to finish the dessert.  Overall I would say I need a second trip to this place or maybe even a third. But it probably would not be on the top of my list if I have a hankering for Chicken and Waffles. The place has a nice ambience to it and almost feels like a fancy diner where you get to sip wine with your dinner and waffles or drink beer with your breakfast and of course waffles. Waffles, waffles, waffles haha.",

    "text": "So it's NOT Roscoe'a flavor. But the chicken is bigger than Roscoe's, greens are really good, service is GREAT, and they have a full bar full of great DRANKS (Blue Ivy alcoholic drink). So waffles could use vanilla/cinnamon cooked into the batter and the syrup could be warmed! Did I mention Excellent service!!! Prices are great...$7 for two huge thighs and a waffle - definitely can share this plate! Grits were very good and such a great variety of pancakes! My daughter had Oreo pancakes - extra huge portion with two pieces of bacon!!! The menu has a variety of other items - not just waffles and chicken. The ribeye steak and eggs and potatoes was phenomenal! Ribeye extremely well seasoned, tender and juicy. I'd highly recommend the ribeye and eggs, over the chicken and waffles.",

It was hot in the restaurant like to the tune of 95 degrees and after mentioning it to our \"bartender/ waiter he confirmed it with little apology.  2. Total attitude from the bartender/ waiter he could use some training on how to actually be professional and engaging. Just saying... 3. The food runner actually handed us our plates vs placing them in front of us. Slightly tacky 4. My cocktail was finished well before our food was brought out but was not offered another until I asked for water so he was way late on the opportunity to sell another cocktail (his loss).  5. The place was very empty but the staff seemed to be clustered around talking to each other.  6. IT WAS SO HOT IN THE RESTAURANT. It really took allot away from the experience I was expecting.   My prediction is this place probably won't be around very long. I won't be going back and recommend finding another option for super thin soggy waffles and really good chicken. Yeah, the chicken was decent.",

    "text": "Today I happened to want something different than TC's Rib Crib. So I thought trying Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffles would be a nice Sunday treat to myself. I get here there were folk waiting outside to be seated not sure Why this was. There establishment is pretty spacious. But there were a number of dirty tables. I was told the wait was 15-20 minutes long. I said for one person as well? There was a Really pretty young adult girl that reminded me of my daughter. She was attentive and stepped in where the female that looked a tad bit older than she wasn't as efficient. I wish I knew her name, Every-time I asked her a question she took charge and handled it. No one knew the Guest WiFi, but this cutie pie did, when I asked Pee could she change the Television she was too busy. Again, this young adult assisted. It took her maybe 5-10 minutes to figure the remote control and the cable  boxes out, but she had patience also courteousness. She cleaned the bar area that was dirty with plates, to allow me access to be seated instantly. Her smile and presence were both bright. So I sit down, it took about 6-8 minutes before I was even noticed. The young adult girl did everything but served me my food and took my order. Pee was a Trainee not sure where Jose's badge was or Why he didn't have it on like the rest of the staff. I asked Pee for a number of things like salt & pepper shakers, more syrup etc. Didn't know she wasn't my server until she spouted this out to me. I guess good customer service weighs on a number of people. She told me that Jose was my Server. Basically letting me know like \"Itch stop calling my name.\" This put a bad taste in my mouth, the Salmon Croquettes were very dry inside as if they were fried too hard and long. I wasn't aware that All there waffles came with cinnamon added in the batter. I thought this was like pancakes, you can request them how you like them. I never saw a GM or Manager that walks around in there restaurants just asking random customers random questions about there service or food this time around. Totally won't spend my money here, with piss poor hospitality. I've had nothing but Great service at other Soul Food spots. And other American restaurants and if there was a problem, you could bet it would be rectified. The way this female spouted out her words let's me know she's done and said anything out of her mouth to black people before this. I may just be the first to blast her on one of my yelp reviews. It's sad, I would've left a better tip hadn't my service with the bar attendants been so dissatisfying.",

We're still waiting on all of our food & we're vastly approaching an hour. We have movie tickets bought already for a 6:40 showing & at this point when we're going to have to ask for everything in a to-go box.   We're completely furious.

After waiting 15 minutes to just get acknowledged by \"blaze\" the bartender I was able to place my whole order being that I hijacked a menu and had enough time to decide what I wanted....tick tock roughly 15 minutes passes..food started emerging from the kitchen for everyone around me. Some of them were there when I got there, so that means they had been waiting on food for at least 30 minutes. Tick tock, another 10mins pass, and a gentleman that came in well after me got his order. After that, blaze, advises me that she forgot to put my order in, and proceeds to putting it in. And I thought, surely it will be out quickly, because when servers make mistakes on orders they are resolved ahead of the other orders....why did I think that, because 15 more minutes pass, and blaze looks at me surprised not to see any food before me. I am livid and not even talking, so she proceeded to go get what I assume was the line chef to come out and tell me my food was behind 2 other tables orders. When I protested and plead my case that I have been waiting an hour she played the asshole role and asked me \"do I want my food or not\"? Where do they do that kind of customer service at? Lo-Lo's Chicken and waffles in Las Vegas, that's where... I wish I could tell you something about the food, but guess what, I never got it. I sat for another 10 mins to speak to the manager I requested, and ultimately took my hungry ass down the street to another dining experience.  I'll never get my time back, but I learned something, and I'll never make this mistake again.  (Lesson: If the service starts off bad, more than likely that's going to be the total experience. Just leave next time.)",

    "text": "I've been following your IG for quite sometime and since I am currently in the Las Vegas area I thought I would it a try. First off Bree Bree the bartender/waitress super sweet. She made a GREAT Bloody Mary drink. I ordered food to go. I ordered a Sheeda's special and fried pickles. Like I said drink was great and Bree Bree told me take my time paying but personally I just like I get the bill out of the way. Okay food ordered and drink on board. Bill paid. So this is where I slowly started becoming disappointed. I ordered my food at 1:30pm. I no longer had anyone come up to ask me if I wanted another drink, a refill on water. I seen multiple employees walking around and that pretty much it. It witnessed one of the employees refill his own side drink but never anyone else. Not one of them including Bree never came back to check up. The place was not very busy at all so I just can't quite understand the service issue. 20 minutes or so later I noticed a to go back sitting across the bar from me. Multiple employees passed right by it but not one checked to see who it was for. Including Bree . So I waited and waited. It sat there for at least 15 minutes. I finally got up and asked the front greeter to please check on my order. He noticed the bag right away asked what I had ordered and said well here it is. I stated to him that bag of food has been sitting there for quite sometime. He said I'm sorry but here is your order with the condiments. I really had high expectations for this place and so disappointed. I leave and get back to my hotel and found no utensils or even napkins. Service needs ALOT of work. Food was really good but cold. I hope this review helps improve your employees attentiveness and service. I highly doubt I will be back soon. My first and last time unfortunately.",

To their defense they were crowded but over the span of 25 minutes no one answers except the answering machine?!? We head in. One lady was at the hostess counter and a few outside waiting to be seated. 7 minutes before a waitress finally came over and asked if we were waited on. The one lady said yes she was waiting for take out n we said we wanted to order. She took our order. I ordered a #1 no eggs and a #3. We leave and come back. Waited another 4 minutes or so and they asked to help us. Get our food, head home. Open the bag and NO GRITS!! Im livid. Called 4x no answer. Due to this crappy service no matter how good the food is I will not be returning",

    "text": "On our way to Laughlin, and since we were going through Vegas I had to stop here.  One of my favorite places to eat.  The weather was beautiful, so we sat outside this time. Seats are comfy and tables roomy, fyi.  I ordered the Tre-Tre (waffle plus two fried chicken legs) and my husband ordered the Lil Amadi (waffle plus two fried chicken thighs). I also got a side of fried okra.  First off--the friend okra. It was pretty darn good, second only to my mom's. I prefer my friend okra sliced slightly thinner and a little more cornmeal to the batter. But it was still really, really good & I'd order it again.  The waffles were just as delicious as I remember...some magical batter with cinnamon and other spices combined with butter and syrup makes them SO good.  And the fried chicken is perfect...crisp and juicy, not too thick of batter.    This time I tried their Lo-Lo's brand hot sauce and was surprised to find I really liked it.  I usually don't like the restaurant brand hot sauce because they're usually too smoky for my tastes.  This one was spicy and tangy, no smoke flavor. I'd actually consider buying it to take home if we weren't headed in the opposite direction!   The water still comes in a Mason jar, which works great for me since I drink a lot. Waitress was fine. Nice smile and friendly.  Gave us the right amount of time between drinks and ordering to look over the menu.  Can't wait to come back in May!!",

The portions are big. Their house hot sauce is the right amount of spicy. Their mac and cheese is gooey and cheesy and creamy. And their banana pudding is to die for. Even things as simple as kool-aid somehow taste better here.  The service is great. The servers are all pleasant, cheery and down to earth. The bartenders are nice and the hostesses have always been sweet.  The problem? That it can take time for you to get service. We've actually went one time when apparently a special event they were hosting was taking up so much of their manpower that the hostess apologized and said we could sit at the bar until they had a table for us. After over 45min we decided it wasn't worth it. The staff was gracious enough to comp my beer and my girlfriends diet coke but wasting so much time still sucked.   They should have just closed up and opened up solely for their VIP event if they couldn't gather enough personnel to man that event and their regular restaurant crowd.   This seems to be a recurring issue with Lolo's because many reviewers say the same thing about slow or non existant service.   Luckily for me this has been an exception and not a rule. And im willing to wait a little for some amazing food. But other patrons might not be as patient.",

We said ok and were told that they would text us when our table was ready. After about 2 hours we were seated.  Meanwhile we observe empty tables throughout the restaurant. We were told that the kitchen was trying to catch up. Service could have been a lot better, it was slow. We ordered our food around 4:30 , we were eating around 5:30! The food was pretty good, but they need to work on a lot of stuff if they want people to comeback",

After all, we took up one side of the restaurant and had 2-3 waiters and they made sure we had EVERYTHING we needed and NOTHING came out wrong.   The menu has a plethora of delicious items to choose from, drinks, and even Kool-Aid on tap!   The fried chicken is perfectly seasoned with a very crispy skin and the waffles are savory until combined with the syrup. I believe you can choose between whole grain waffles and regular waffles--either way, they are both delicious.   Music is hip-hop/r&b and the vibe of the entire restaurant is just real chill. The servers and staff are also very friendly and helpful and will make sure you have an amazing time and that you're well taken care of!",

Roscoe is Roscoe and Lo-Lo's is Lo-Lo's... don't compare.   It's located 15 -20 minutes outside Vegas, in a big shopping plaza, on the Best Buy side, next to a McDonald's and Sweet Tomatoes restaurant.   We went on a Saturday around 1:00, used Yelp to join the waitlist and upon arrival, we were seated immediately. The place is noisy and family oriented. Very animated.  Our server was great!! Very attentive and said they had an ownership change and pretty much every staff was new. She said food was made to order, and there was 7 parties ahead of us. No worries I had my phone and a huge jar of sweet tea...  I wish they had biscuits or cornbread to snack on, as it was a good wait. Worth it though and my food was delicious. Chicken was crispy and moist. My candied yams was sweet and not mushy.   They ran out of grits and offered to sub for something else.. so I got Mac and cheese. Delicious!! However upon leaving I spied a table that had grits. Therefore one less star. They could have asked if I was willing to wait, if they were making more.   Stephen had the fried fish and he enjoyed it with the collard greens and waffle.  With 2 teas, lunch was $40. Worth the wait and the drive.",

I would suggest that you expect to wait 30 minutes or more for your food, that way you're not disappointed or offended when/if it happens. We LOVE the food and service, so the wait time for our food doesn't bother us when we visit this spot.",

I can in on Monday afternoon at 2:00 pm 5/27/19 and was told there is a 90 minutes wait to be seated and additional time for someone to take your order.   I was baffled because 2/3 of the tables were unoccupied. So I asked how long it will take to get my food if I place a take away order. The lady at the desk says it be about 45 minutes. I decided to leave.   As I am still craving fried chicken & waffles; I called the restaurant at 6:30 PM on the same day and asked if I could place a phone order. I was told they are not taking phone orders. So I drove from Summerlin to the restaurant to place my order.   Upon arrival at 7:00 PM, I was told it will be 15 minutes before they can take my take away order and I was told to sit in the foyer and wait for the lady at the cashiers desk to call me.   It is now 7:30 PM , I am currently sitting in the foyer and will continue writing this review after my food is ready (hopefully my food will be ready before midnight).  So, my food was ready at 7:34 PM. I ate in my car and I must say it was actually good. I am not having an orgasm or anything like that but the chicken and waffles we better than average. My meal cost $16.99 and contained 2 legs, 1 thigh and 2 waffles.   In my opinion, the staff need major customer service training and they also need some attitude adjustment. My observation conclude that they are not customer friendly. So if you go be there be prepared to receiving major shade from the staff.  Unfortunately, because of the customer service or lack of customer service and the excessive wait time Ihave to give them 2 1/2 stars. If the get there act tougher they can easily get 4 stars from me because the food was good.",

This used to be my go to restaurant anytime I was in town and for a few months it was consistently good, however over the course of the last year it's gone drastically downhill. From the poor service (literally takes 15-20 mins just for someone to acknowledge you once you've sit down), to the temperature of the food that comes out (straight cold, not even Luke warm). The last 2 times I visited I though maybe they were just having an off day since it was a Saturday afternoon so I went back again to order the same thing on Tuesday (huge mistake and waste of time and money). When I brought up the fact that my food was cold to my server I was met with \"well it was hot when it came out the kitchen\"...seriously that's your response after I just waited almost 45 mins for a completely cold entree ?!? Safe to say I'm officially done with this place and will no longer be giving them anothe chance.",

Why is there a DJ playing loud ass music?  3. Why have we been seated and no one has come to take our order?  4. Why did we just get up and walk out?  Ok so I've been here several times but not in the last 7 months! I think they made us wait to test out their little texting system to let you know the tables is ready...why? NO ONE is in here!!!!  Having a DJ play loud ass rap music is so ratchet! I'm sorry I like rap but this is not the place for it and you run the risk of only attracting one type of customer. And I'm sorry I don't want to see the staff booty popping to the loud ass music either.  We were seated and sat and sat and sat AND no one came to take our order....at least a drink order. It was too much....so my husband and I just got up and walked out!   I met the owner last year and he was really nice and seemed genuinely interested in making this place a success but with this new direction I don't see myself returning. The service is HORRIBLE and it reminds me of club gone bad!",

    "text": "Well, we never ate. We never ate because no one was really waiting on us.....  Let me start from the beginning. My brother and I arrived around 2pm on a Sunday. We joined the waitlist and went across the street for some shopping. We were quoted a 45 minute wait time. They were on time with the wait and we were seated promptly within the 45 minutes.  The atmosphere is exciting and fun. It kind of mimics a backyard barbecue feel. Yet, I was annoyed by how incredibly loud the music was.  Now, for my real qualm. The waitstaff was really nice. Although, it does seem as if they're stretched a bit thin. A very nice young lady brought us waters and took our orders, but mentioned she was only passing it on to a mythical creature she referred to as \"your server\". My brother ordered the waffles and I ordered the chicken tenders and cornbread. I looked so forward to trying the food here. But, NO WAITRESS EVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE.  Our drinks were never refilled and the straws we were promised never materialized. We sat unattended for about 25 minutes when we made a decision to just leave. Clearly they didn't care. Also, the majority of those 25 minutes a manager sat at the table next to us fiddling with papers. Sunday rush seems like a fine time to get your files in order, said no professional in the service industry ever.   I'd still like to try the food. But, I don't really find being treated like a second class citizen a strong incentive. We arrived at 2pm and left hungry at 330pm. What a shame!",

The ice waters are giant, which was great for a warm, sunny day.  The food was good, but just good. I was expecting to be wowed by my Red Velvet Pancakes but they didn't blow me away. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but needed maple syrup and that did not come with them. It took a few moments to flag someone down and bring some over. I'm totally cool with not bringing it out by default and having it go to waste, but ask me if I want some proactively.  Families: The music played here is loud and often explicit, even at 1030 am. I don't have an issue with it, but you may not want your little kids subjected to it.",

First we were greeted by a girl with 4 big \"love bites on her neck. Yuck!!! She seemed a little confused to find us a seat. She told us that she was told not to sit us in a booth because there was no service available in those areas. So we asked to sit in the bar area. She was very hesitant, and was reluctant, but she eventually sat us.  My observation was that their were 4 customers that were very unhappy with the customer service and their waitress, which left in the middle of her service. As for us, it took 15 minutes for a waitress to arrive and take our order.   Although our waitress was nice, she seemed very overwhelmed. I was confused. There were 4 staff rolling utensils at a snails pace. Chatting on their phones, obviously having words and attitudes with each other. The bartender didn't move from his station. It was apparent that he did not have that many drink orders. I guess he has that \"I am busy, but not really busy routine down.\" It was also obvious he loved to flirt with the females. There was around 10 staff members hanging out in the bar area, but only 8 customers, and 1 waitress serving 3 tables.  Got a chance to check out the kitchen. Bingo now I know were are the waitresses are hanging out. It was like they were having a party. So I decided to go on the other side an count the customers. 15 customers in the other sitting area. There was more staff than customers No excuse for the bad customer service.In my opinion, it was obvious that the manager has no control over his employees. He was more a part of the problem than anything. When I can watch more employees walking out of the restaurants with containers of food and drink there are definitely issues.   We watched how the manager handled the unhappy guest. He did a \"fly by apology\" He seemed more afraid of the customer. He discussed the error, gave a huge discount, and quickly walked away and dived back into the employee drama. Laughing, giggling, and avoiding serious issues with his staff. We finally received our food. Looked delicious but we had no utensils. The waitress that brought our food notice we had no utensils, she walked over to the group of utensil rollers. She picked up a set, then was quickly scolded by one of the staff for taking a set he rolled. So I watched her clean off our utensils and roll it in a napkin. Let me remind you, we are 2 tables away from this action.   Our original waitress came back and apologize for all the drama. I just wanted my sweet tea refilled. I was so over the high school drama. I will go to LA to Roscoe's if I want really drama. By the way, the food tasted great!!!!",

I just remember gizzards being hard pieces of fried something I would have to chew on a bit to be able to swallow. I know, I still ordered them because I was curious. Wasn't expecting much but was totally blown away.  F had the Tre Tre (2 chicken drumsticks and a waffle). Although I didn't try the chicken (next time), I did sample the waffle naked. (Major food phobia for me; syrup isn't allowed to touch savory foods.) The waffle had a nice cinnamon-y taste, softer than a traditional waffle. Good.  I had Uncle Brotha's Shrimp & Grits. My grits were creamy, full of flavor with nice sized shrimp, bacon, onions, mushrooms, and cheese. I am so glad I didn't change my mind about trying them. I mean, I had that on my mind when I first saw their menu online, but when I had the menu in my hand...well, there was soo much to choose from.  My meal came with one of the fluffiest biscuits I have ever had. (Can't wait to try their biscuits and gravy.) I could've used some honey for a touch of sweet for it or maybe even some honey butter, but that's just me. The biscuit and butter it came with was perfectly fine by itself.  I chose lemonade by itself (I'm a lemonade purist) though was very tempted by the grape Cool-aid/lemonade mix. It was very pretty. I know, but visual is a part of my foodie make up.  We went at 530p on a weekday and there was no wait to speak of. Service was wonderful. Our server was Jasmine, who was quick and funny.   Both F and I commented on the fact we loved that our food was cooked at order. I don't understand people who go to a restaurant and expect their food in five minutes. I like that my food wasn't sitting under a warmer hoping that someone would order that particular dish.  Lolo's was another mark in the Win column. Can't wait for the next visit.",

Very pleasant and attentive and had a great smile! Our server from previous trips -Nate- was also working today and took time out from his tables to come greet us and make sure we were okay. It's this attention to detail that makes the dining experience at LoLo's better than the rest!! The Cherry on top was that the owner himself (Nino) would stop at each table to check on his guest or greet them as they entered the dining area. He was even bussing tables! Now tell me that's not a cut above the rest... Now that I've covered the service; the food and drinks are up next: we ordered the Toy-Toy with sides and our order came out within 10 minutes, if that. Our order was specific and the cook got it right...down to my crisp but not over cooked waffle! I had the Purplesaurus Rex and let me tell you that one drink was sufficient . Overall, dining at LoLo's was a great experience. I'll definitely be back... And I will patronize the location opening in Sacramento, CA as well!!! Kudos Nino, Bre, Nate and Team!!",

    "text": "Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles is best known for being the Roscoe's of the Phoenix area but like everyone else they just had to get a piece of Vegas.  I have been here twice on different occassions.  During peak hours and the weekends, this place can get quite busy.  The best part about this Vegas location is that there is lots of parking even though it is a drive from both DTLV and the Strip.  My first time around I came to spend time with my cousins at the bar.  I ordered the Georgia On My Mind, which was suprisingly good.  As far as my second time around, I had to give Lo Lo's another try before leaving.  I ordered the Lo Lo's (# 3 on the menu) which was 3 pcs of chicken and 2 waffles.  The chicken was nice and juicy and not too bready.  The waffles had a hint of cinnamon yet were thick and delicious.  As far as I know, Roscoe's wins the battle of the waffle, but Lo Lo's wins on variety because there is EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY.  Also unlike Roscoe's, Lo Lo's serves alcoholic drinks and serves most of their drinks in Mason jars.  The service was great and exceeded my expectations.  For those who LOVE Roscoe's you will have mixed feelings about Lo Lo's.  For those who had Lo Lo's in Phoenix, you would expect the same great food and service at the Las Vegas location.",

I'm from California and I have eaten at roscoes many times, which has set the bar pretty high. They did have good tasting side dishes though.. (Mac n cheese, whipped potatoes)",

The front counter was impossible to get to when we walked in (people standing everywhere) the wait time was supposedly 20-30 minutes. Finally, after 45 minutes, a spot opened at the bar, so we sat there instead. 10 minutes later, we still hadn't been acknowledged or the counter in front of us cleaned. We decided to try and be seated at a table instead, and it still took over 10 minutes for a server to come to us (after she got drinks for 2 tables that had been seated after us). There was no, \"Hi, how are you?\" Just a \"do y'all know what you want?\"  We ordered the spicy corn fritters and when they arrived, they were ice cold on the inside. When we told the waitress, she just took the basket and walked away. Then my gf had ordered the salmon croquettes and, while they smelled fishy, there was hardly any actual salmon inside, but it had plenty of inedible ingredients.   Next time we'll just go to McDonald's next door.",

Yea you can judge me but I wanted ok? The grits are pretty standard, nothing to rave about. Eggs were seasoned well but the waffles are definitely softer than expected. They take on a pancake type fluffiness with a hint of cinnamon. I would order them again now that I know not to expect crispy. I tried my wife's catfish which was good also. I really wanted some baked Mac and cheese but it is stovetop with a cheesy sauce type thing going on. Not my favorite but OKish. Make sure you ask for the drink happy hour price because they may not mention it. Prepare to wait a bit on your food.",

Chicken is crisp and full of flavor.  My one complaint...KJ...get those waffles to the table piping hot.  Butter should be able to melt on them.

I'm happy to say except for a few differences it matches (if not surpasses) the Arizona restaurant.  The taste of the food is what I remember Lo-Lo's being. The chicken and the rice and beans were spot on.  Kevin Johnson of Cal, Phoenix Sun's, and mayor of Sacramento fame is on hand.  And it's obviously he's not just there to glad hand the customers.  His presence alone makes me secure in adding Lo-Lo's to my local restaurant rotation. Bravo on the comeback!",

    "text": "Easily one of the worst meals we've had here in Vegas. I should give zero stars but considering one of the front end employees acknowledged our complaints I'm giving one.  We came in on a Thursday evening and there's only one other table including ours. We ordered fried chicken and waffles and it came out a little too quickly which I thought was odd. But right off the bat we noticed the chicken was too brown - basically burnt. Not only was it burnt but it was beyond dry. I had one thigh that was somewhat edible. The mac and cheese was so chewy and dry it tasted like it was sitting under a heating lamp.   When our check came and noticed how much we would paying for an inedible meal, we talked to our server about it. She apologized and said \"most days the chicken is golden but for some reason today I noticed the darker color.\" What?? The fact that she even noticed and and still served it to us is crazy. She spoke to someone about our complaint and offered a 10% discount.   As we were leaving the front end employee asked how everything was and by both mine and my wife's \"okay\" she kindly wanted to address the issue. She said she would talk to the kitchen and has mentioned to them before that when it is slow food should be made cooked-to-order (duh.) She wanted us to give them a second chance but honestly we probably wouldn't considering the price of the food. She also told us they were having a re-grand opening tomorrow and all I could think was that they're not off to a very good 2nd start. I told her if the kitchen staff wouldn't eat dry and burnt chicken themselves, it shouldn't be on the plate. Period. Should have went with the yelp reviews and avoided this place altogether.",

I ordered the KK to go btw. As soon as i get home i open it up to find that they forgot my eggs and condiments and such. So i call them up and the guy who answered the phone very rude like and it was pretty upsetting, i told him that i ordered to go and that i never got my eggs, he then proceeds to tell me that i did get my eggs but i clearly didnt, but it couldve been some misunderstanding from his part. So finally he transfers me to a manager which took about 5 minutes, the manager finally answers and asks what happened and i told her that they forgot my eggs and she said well you can come back for your eggs, at this point i was pretty annoyed because i live pretty far from lolos and i wasnt willing to drive all the way back, she then tells me what i would want instead but i said i live too far to come back, like do you not have something to do incase something like this ever happens? like to put my name down for a free meal? so i told her that and she continued to put my name down in kind of a pissy attitude like they wouldnt want to comp me or something, then i just hung up. But i highly doubt ill get my free meal if i ever go back there because they probably forgot about writing it down or something.",

When she was able to catch up to our waitress she asked about her toast. The waitress told her they had no more wheat toast she asked for white toast which was never brought. My friend had to ask 3 times for a to go box. When the check was brought the waitress said they hand no more covers to put it in. Terrible service all around.",

Food comes out slow but gives you more time to grasp hold of the decor.  Drinks 1 of 5  Ordered a Bloody Bacon Mary, extremely over seasoned but lacked one thing... Oh yeah alcohol.  Food 2 of 5  Chicken and Waffles was just ok. Waffles were extremely soggy and the chicken was a little over cooked for my taste with an overpowering amount of sodium. I had to ditch most of the breading and go straight for the chicken. Would have been nice to have a choice of how your eggs are cooked, instead the scramble it then throw some raw onions in it with some cheese. Definitely a pass on those. The grits were so so, drowned in a lot of butter and love.   Catfish appetizer wasn't that exciting either..  Overall you need a hole in the wall place for good soul food. This feels like a Roscoe and Applebee's had a bastard step child that tries to be a little to fancy. Really nothing drawing me back to this place.",

It wasn't that busy, but our group of 5 may have been hard to accommodate.  What I loved about LoLo's in PHX was the hospitality, charm, and service. This location definitely lacked all of that. We were served our food without silverware and our server just didn't do it for me.  I have to say the food was good. I get their fried chicken smothered in sauce. I'm not a chicken and waffles type of person, but their fried chicken is delicious and I definitely recommend it. Prices are a little higher, but the food quality and quantity definitely make up for it.  Definitely try their garbage fries. Maybe they're called trash fries. Either way they are delicious.   I was dying to go back to LoLo's in PHX for the longest time, but since coming to this Vegas location I don't have any urge to go back anytime soon. The food was good but the way our group was handled put a bad taste in my mouth.",

Well once I dug into my food I can taste the cinnamon flavor in the waffle and with the syrup and butter it was amazing and combined some bites with the super juicy tenders and they weren't average tenders these were massive pieces of chicken and it comes with barbeque or ranch and I had chosen barbeque. Started eating and when I did I put my phone down and enjoyed my food I had mixed the chicken with the waffle and it gave a whole new work of flavor and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't like to much, were the drinks that are a bit over priced..  They had very friendly staff and extremely comfortable atmosphere I would recommend this place (have already) and I would definitely come back here",

Great crunch and flavor! The chicken and waffles looked great! However 2 of my 3 chicken wings were overcooked and dry; and there was an overall lack of flavor. The waffle was nothing to talk about, I only ate half.   I was hoping for more and Lo-Lo's did not deliver. Because the service was so good and they had other good looking options on the menu, we will be returning to give some of those a try.   Go 'head and give me a try... it's worth a try.",

We also got the Aunt Portia's omelet and another order of Oreo pancakes.  The restaurant wasn't busy and yet it took a half hour for our food to arrive.  While it looked delicious, it was deceiving.  The omelet was way overdone and the chicken in it was incredibly dry.  My pancakes were burnt and too dry to eat.  The cream cheese frosting tasted more like sour cream so I couldn't even use that to mask the taste of burnt pancakes.  The bill came and for 3 drinks ($3.50 a piece for soda!!), two orders of burnt pancakes and a dry over cooked omelet it was over $50!  At that point I had to ask for the manager and he took $20 off our bill.  Yeah, that didn't cut it for a horrible dining experience.",

This trip a very friendly and efficient Tenikia  served me from behind the bar. She was very friendly and paid attention to small details in her service routine  I think both time here I ate breakfast and the biscuits are huge and excellent.  Food here is cooked with care, fresh and nice portions.  I promise to try the chicken and waffles next time",

This day I believe was the first day all menu items were available, so sort of a grand opening (hence the wait) not sure how it is on any other day.    Once inside the restaurant we were greeted with the delightful aromas of fried chicken and waffles and friendly staff.   I love waffles and I love fried chicken, however, I have never been a fan of them together. Unfortunately this wouldn't be the time I tell you I have converted either.    The fried chicken was amazing and I would definitely come back for the chicken, but the waffles??? The waffles were so underwhelming I could not get past two bites.   They were floppy soft and to cinnamon flavored.  Just awful! We also ordered a corn bread muffin which was inedible, dry and hard.   I loved that they serve a variety of beverages including grape, green apple, and watermelon Kool-Aid. The flavors will vary though.  The server was really nice, but she brought us all the wrong drinks.  The staff seemed overwhelmed and come to find out the wait to be seated also had to do with letting the kitchen catch up.   Oh well, overall it was ok, and like I mentioned the fried chicken is worth coming back for.",

    "text": "My daughter raved about this spot and so I ventured here with her on my last trip to Vegas. Located in a shopping center there was plenty of parking on a weekday afternoon. The restaurant is spacious with table and booth seating. Service was kind and attentive. They offer alcoholic drinks but I settled on a glass of water (served in a mason jar - cute), fried green beans, and an entree of three pieces of chicken, 2 waffles, eggs, and grits. I was really hoping they had fried pickles, the green beans were good but not very flavorful. The grits were smothered in butter and tasted lovely. Chicken was seasoned deliciously and cooked perfectly. Eggs were good but it's hard to mess those up. Had a peach cobbler for dessert... it was more like peaches, ice cream, and cake??? Not really a traditional peach cobbler with crust and gooey goodness. Still tasted okay but definitely not what I expected. When compared to my hometown fav, Roscoes, I like the chicken better here but Roscoes wins on the waffles. Lo-Lo's waffles were good but it's the chicken and grits that would bring me back.",

I learned the new ownership took over about two months ago and I must say it is definitely noticed. Vast improvements with the front house staff and the food quality is great. My only downside was the flat, un-crisp waffle. Love the large mason jars for the drinks, the spacious dining area playing comforting classic rhythm and blues tunes, and the bountiful food quantity which fills the plates. Lo-Lo's has turned into a real treat and much better than other local \"southern food eateries\". The new owner can be found assisting the floor staff and visiting with patrons. I would suggest everyone visit and take in the relaxing, enjoyable experience.",

I ordered the Betty Boob (1 juicy breast, 1 delicious waffle) and spicy corn fritters! The chicken really is juicy mmmmmm! Soooooo delicous! I definitely recommend this place if you don't mind a long wait!  They lost 1 star because the service was so unorganized and the wait was soooooo long.  1. We watched them seat two tables without them wiping it down from the previous people eating there. GROSS! 2. We asked the host if we can sit at the bar and she gave us a dumb look and said \"I don't know\". (Just so you know... If youre 21 you can sit at the bar if you want to skip the long wait, at least that's what we did.) 3. They have a bar with no alcohol because they don't have their liquor license yet. 4. The workers look like they don't like their job with no type of energy, looking lost and confused... Except our server PJ! He was great! 5. 45 minute wait for a table and another 45 minute ticket wait for the food. (PJ said the wait was worse yesterday!)  Me and my boyfriend will definitely be back for the great food! Hopefully the service is better by then.. But I guess I should've expected it knowing that it is their soft opening. Almost gave this place 2-3 stars but luckily the food was just that yummy to me!",

    "text": "Boy, that's some mighty fine Chicken and Waffles!  Tonight's the second night they've been open and the service was great. They're incredibly busy, but wait time was very reasonable for service. If you're going in the near future, get there as early as possible. The menu is limited and there are no To Go orders until the kitchen gets up to speed. That's a good idea since they're so busy.   They claim to have Chicken and Waffles in the Top 5 in the country and I don't doubt it one bit. The KK's platter is three pieces of chicken, two waffles, two eggs, and grits for $15. That's a lot of food. The chicken was perfectly cooked and among the best we've ever had. The waffles were the same level of goodness. There's something about their waffles and syrup that's just \"it\"...some sort of perfect combo.   The Shrimp and Mac and Cheese was top notch, as well. The mac part is super cheesy and perfectly creamy. The shrimp? Yup, just as good.   My Shrimp and Grits were good, but completely overshadowed by the chicken. The grits are unseasoned which is great for breakfast (fix 'em up yourself!), but for a savory dish, should support the main item better than these did. It's still good, but I'd go for KK' s over this.   Overall, it was a great meal and the service was very good. You can tell they're just getting their \"sea legs\", but we had fantastic service even for an established restaurant.",

The first thing ordered from the menu was not available at this location and there were no substations. Then there was no pink lemonade. After waiting an hour the food finally came.   We were told that there was no corn bread which came with the meals. It was substituted with biscuits, which were not good. Some of the food was cold and room temperature from sitting. The bread on the chicken sandwich was hard and a request was made for another piece. After waiting 5 more minutes we were told that for some reason all of the bottom pieces of the bread were hard so we were asked if another top piece would work. This was not our first visit here, but by far the worst. Our server was great, but the wait time and presentation of the meals was subpar. Not once did management come to the table until requested. Very disappointing. On a good note, I will say that the blackened catfish meal was good and so were the hot wings. I honestly can't say that I look forward to coming back again soon, at least not on a weekend. The two stars are for the waitress and the 2 of 4 meals that were good. Once the manager surfaced I shared my concerns and he took 30% off the bill but tried to charge us for the corn bread that was not available. Did I mention that I had to get up from the table to ask for the bill and had to get back up after 7 minutes of waiting for someone to take payment to ask where do we pay. The bill was corrected. I honestly have to say that after that whole experience I will not return.",

Even though it was slow , It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, she messed up the order about 5 times before actually getting it right and she kept forgetting half of our order, I shouldn't have to remind my waitress of the food that I already put in the order for. Other people that arrived after us got their food before we even did, I am never recommending this place nor will i ever come back. I am also in the customer service industry so seeing this kind of behavior really does piss me off and is unacceptable, as a paying customer i did expect great service.",

He didn't seem to understand the frustration of paying customers who waited over two hours for our food. When I expressed my frustration with the manager...who also had a lack of words for their Unsat customer service the best he could offer was to change servers. We ended up taking some food to-go and leaving some on the table. Our friends from Phoenix warned us but we thought it was just the location...nope!

Here comes the one issue I've had. Usually comes to LoLo's and sit and eat well today I decided to pick it up. Well that was A HUGE MISTAKE. Tried calling from my house which is at least 15-20 mins away and no one answered the call. Assumed they where busy since it's a holiday I choose just to drive there. Showed up and it wasn't slow but wasn't busy enough for the phone not to be answered. I was greeted by a host, \"Hello I need to place a to-go order.\" The host then told me to sit at the bar and the bartender told me it was a certain person who did to-go orders. After waiting almost 20 mins that person finally came to ask for my order. The bartender told the person more then once what I was waiting on and still nothing. I felt like I had to get in his face to finally get some service. I don't even know why I waited that long but after driving here I didn't just want to leave. And I really wanted chicken and waffles and they are by far the best. Speaking to a manger is a joke cause I was just told they where busy. Which I understand but that isn't a reason to ignore a customer. I finally got to order the LoLo's which is amazing as always. My suggestion if you want LoLo's to go just do Doordash cause that's the only way to actually get some service for to-go. I'm very disappointed in the service and it turned me off completely.",

Once I ate a piece that wasn't the case. It was very moist. The okra was also good. My husband is hard to please when it comes to soul food.. especially chicken and waffles. He was very pleased. This will be our new go to spot when in Vegas.",

    "text": "I had my eye on this place since before it opened, but I wanted to wait until I had visitors in town so it would be a special occasion. I'm pleased to say, it was worth the wait.  My dining companions ordered the 3 ap platter with Spicy Corn Fritters, catfish biegnets, and fried green tomatoes. The corn fritters were killer - I will definitely order them if I go again. They were a little spicier than I expected, but it was a nice surprise. The fried green tomatoes were good, but I had never had that dish before and I know it is something people have a lot of opinions about. I didn't have the catfish, but it looked crispy and my friends said they liked it.  We ordered booze as well, and I felt the mixed drinks were a pretty reasonable value. I got the Georgia On My Mind, which was excellent, and I tried my friend's Orange Creamsicle, which was also excellent. The gentlemen in our party got beer, which was stated as the house special but rang up as Busch Light on our bill: not sure if our waiter was giving us the hook-up on price, or if they are actually passing off Busch Light as a house special.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken platter with Mac n Cheese, buttered corn and cornbread. The mac n cheese was great, best I've ever had in a chain restaurant. It's baked, so it tastes homemade instead of the weirdly liquid cheese you get at some other places. The buttered corn definitely came from the bottom of the pot, but it tasted fine in spite of looking kinda weird. The chicken fried chicken was crispy outside and juicy inside. The dish comes \"smothered in sausage gravy,\" but I asked for the gravy on the side because I thought it might make the chicken soggy. The gravy was delicious and chunky when I dipped my chicken in it, so I can't wait to go back and get the Biscuits and Gravy.   My friends split the KKs special (which was a good idea because the ap platter was huge!) They were very pleased with the fried chicken, waffle and scrambled eggs, but the grits had huge mountains of butter on them, and they didn't particularly care for the grits under the butter.  I definitely plan to go back. There are at least 5 other things on the menu I'm dying to try!",

Also, since it was my birthday, they brought out a HUGE slice of red velvet cake, which was also yummy! Also, they were blasting 90's R & B and rap. Can't go wrong with that LOL.

The hosts/greeters are always smiling, basically treating you like family and the waiter/waitress service has been the same, nothing but smiles, check back the right amount, not too much, not too little. The food is A-1 soul food, chicken has always been cooked to perfection, big wings and breasts(I'ma white meat guy), and I've liked their sides as much as any other soul food or bbq joint I've been to in Vegas, the sides could definitely be bigger though! Sweet tea and diabetes water, aka kool-aid is just as off the chain as it was when we were pouring a 1/4 bag in our home concoctions as kids!!!",

We didn't get our appetizers until long after we got our food which took a really long time to arrive as well. They had forgotten about the appetizers and half of a friends meal. Our server wasn't very friendly either. Also, when our food came out, a few minutes later, our server came out and said \"okay what are we missing?\" I don't think that's the first thing I would ask a table who doesn't have most of their food. I ordered the chicken breast and waffle and the chicken was almost burnt with one really greasy spot somehow. I wouldn't recommend this place.",

The food didn't settle well and I had to get it out and it was the most gruesome purge. It made me sick and now I'm in the bathroom.  There wasn't that many people in the restaurant for service to be so terrible. I was highly disappointed I don't recommend anyone trying that place. I spoke with friends that went before me and they said the lemon water was the best thing on the menu.  Save your money guys they have work to do on food and service.  Just terrible!!!",

    "text": "Overall, I was underwhelmed. I ordered the LoLo's 3 piece chicken and waffles. If \"chicken and waffles\" is in the name of the restaurant, then it better be the best darn chicken and waffles ever! Sadly, it was the not. The 3 piece was an assortment - drumstick, thigh, and wing. All the pieces where cooked inconsistently. Mostly my impression was dry - the chicken was definitely overcooked. The waffle also did not knock my socks off. Just plain, nothing special, a little soggy.  I also sampled the cornbread - again not impressed. Dry and lacking flavor.  Husband ordered the catfish - doesn't seem fresh. For a lack of better description, it had an overly fishy taste and odor. Hard to get over. Won't be ordering that again.   Also, I hate commenting about service because it just varies with every visit and depends on which waitstaff you get - but this place needs some help. We got seated in the bar area (which we did not choose, the hostess put us there) and there was only one waitress working the entire bar and covering the tables. Who made that call? She was seriously over-extended and unfortunately that meant no service for us. Never got an offer for drink refills (I had to flag down the manager to get this accomplished). And after the food was hastily dropped off, no one came by to check on us once. I pointed out again to the manager how no one was helping us and she did nothing (I also overheard the table next to us making the same complaint to the manager). Nothing was done to correct the situation- the manager just simply made the excuse of servers calling in or showing up late. It's your job to manage the staff and fill in if needed. So bottom line - won't be coming back.",

I've read some interesting reviews. We went during a week day afternoon. No waiting & customer service was good. I ask my husband would he give Lo-Lo's a 4?  He said no a 5 so that speaks volumes coming from a harsh critic like him.",

    "text": "Mom heard about this place on the radio a few weeks ago. She came to visit this weekend so we thought we'd check out their website for menu items and pricing. As I scroll through, no prices, of course.....but there it was.... FRIED GREEN TOMATOES!!! Mom has been DYING for fried green tomatoes! We raced down there, excited and a little worried (who knows how popular they could be; line out the door?). We walked in and were seated right away. Lolo's is a large place (they took over the old Tony Romas) with plenty of seating. We were given a temporary menu as the place has only been open for 5 days and they don't have all the items they need for their complete menu, yet (the hostess told us). We peruse the menu, searching for the tomatoes....there they are.....wait.... $7???? OK well, how many come in the order? Server double checks and tells us there are 4 in an order. 4??? These must be some amazing tomatoes! So, we order them as well as the spicy corn fritters as appetizers. Spicy corn fritters were Amazing!!! I loved them. The tomatoes on the other hand were so so. Definitely not worth the price. Kind of disappointing since we chose this place because of the tomatoes! Mom ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. No where near enough gravy to go with the biscuits, the potatoes were seasoned well but they were underdone and on the firm side. Mom asked for her eggs to be fried well done as she is not a fan of a runny yolk. One of the egg yolks wasn't completely cooked so she cut it away and put it on a separate plate so it wouldn't run into her gravy. I ordered the waffle and chicken breast (Betty Boob, I believe they called it). My meal was good, nothing spectacular. The warm syrup was pretty good.   Overall, service was great. Our server was attentive and quick. Just wish for a better bang for my buck! Mom and i went Dutch. Corn fritters and Betty Boob (i drank water) cost me $16.22 with tax. At the bottom of my receipt, the recommended tip is $3.00 (18.5%). Paid the check and took our time leaving.   Will I be back? Maybe. Could do those fritters again.",

I'm not a big waffle eater but they're ok. The wait may be a little long depending on when u go... Be mindful when u decide to pay them a visit. The Kool aid is on point...I like the watermelon and green apple. Although the service was slow the first time, we sat at the bar the second time and it was much faster. The staff was very friendly and attentive as possible though each time. Gotta go back and check out a couple more items now since their fill menu is avail and I can't wait until they full bar is available.",

My youngest daughter fell asleep at the table. \"Stupid Fries\" we're delicious. Chicken and waffles were not seasoned well. Shrimp in the shrimp and grits was good but the grits tasted like water. I've been to the location in Phoenix and the service was better. I may give it another go in a few months.",

We noticed alot of empty booths???  The lady that sat besides me (she said that she has eaten at the original one from Arizona and says this as good as that one) she said the same thing(I'll get back to this at the end)...so the bartender asks us what we would like so we start off??? We started off with coffee...I must say the coffee is great and the Size if the cup was awesome  as we look over our menu...it's breakfast but dying to come back for dinner already with all this menu items that I have to try...but we order jalapeno sliders and #1 which consists of....Chicken and waffles...what did u think I was gunna say???  Lol Anyways there was sooooooooooo many choices to pick from but this is our first time sooooooooooo OG is what we are here for...the sliders came up (it took a bit being an appetizer) and as Smoky from Friday would put it....DAMNNNNNNNN!!!!!  (the only thing missing was the cheese) then the OG platter comes up right after....the Chicken AWESOME the Waffles AWESOME the grits AWESOME and eggs and cheese AWESOME the onions on top of eggs not so awesome at least for me....whoops forgot the gravy AWESOME with tableside hot sauce fucking AWESOME!!! The service was friendly and on point...now the bartender ask is everything?  My response Hell Yeah!!! I tell him can't wait to come back...the only question on my mind is....

    "text": "After driving by this restaurant a few times, my family and I decided to give it a try today. We put our name in a wait list and we were told 20-30 minute wait. No problem. I thought this was acceptable for such a busy place. 50 minutes later we had to walk out. Complete chaos, disorganized, and clearly no one in charge! I saw at least 6 empty tables and booths in the bar area alone. We, along with many other groups were patiently waiting to be seated even though it was clear, by the look of the hostess, who just stared at the wait list of names on her roster as if it would materialize into a plan, our chances weren't looking good. There were 2 hostesses, a tall man in a polo shirt and a bartender who could not make heads or tails of the situation! A couple helped themselves to a booth in the bar area cutting off at least 8 parties waiting for tables and the hostess tried to get them to leave the table but she walked away in frustration doing nothing to control the situation. We decided to leave after 50 minutes of waiting, still 8 down on the waiting list, which hadn't moved at all. I went to the hostess and the man in the polo shirt and said \"take my name off I won't wait any longer.\" I didn't get an apology, an explanation, a \"please try us again\"...nothing. I felt as though, if things were not bad enough, the fact that me leaving and not receiving even an acknowledgement of the amount of time that I waited, actually made it worse! So if anyone in charge of this franchise is reading this post, I would highly recommend that you come in and take a look at what is going on in your establishment.  I won't waste another 50 minutes waiting for a table at Lo-Lo's. Nor will I recommend it to anyone. We drove up W. Lake Mead and had a great lunch at Grape Street. If I could continue this post with no stars, I would.",

For one the sweet tea was a mason jar of sugar, then they gave me the wrong order, it took about 20 min to get my food right, there was a hair on my yams, and the rice was not cooked through. Not only that but our waitress Jazmin was hitting on my man. My boyfriend was like, what is this girl doing??!?! Point is I was starving and ended up not eating cause I was grossed out and dissapointed. The manager said, \"give it sometime it'll get better.\"  I say, save your self the trouble don't go there.",

We'll start with the Pros: - Fried Green Tomatoes were very good. - Sweet Tea was delicious. - Restaurant interior was very nice. - Fried Chicken was tender. - Good portion size.  Now the Cons: - Too much breading on the Fried Chicken - Never offered any drink refills. - Our waiter, who was a \"supervisor\", had to ask us 3 times what our order was. - Several other waiters were arguing in the back corner of the restaurant (about 10 feet from our table) - I've never been to a restaurant, until now, where waiters were sitting around eating food while their customers were waiting for the check (they actually seemed over-staffed). - The Collard Greens looked like they came out of can. - The Cole Slaw had no flavor. - The fries tasted like store-bought fries (for an additional $2), which our waiter said would be amazing. - When asked what type of fries they had, our waiter's response was \"french fries\" (and he wasn't joking).  The Health Inspection Rating of a B should have been my first warning that this was not going to be the experience I had hoped for.  I don't think the couple across from us was having a good experience either, as the gentlemen was questioning the freshness of the dessert he was given in a to-go container, asking several times if it was made fresh today, and all the server could say was that it was put in that container today.",

When the manager realized the errors. He did not come over to apologize for the mistake, nor did the waiter. He made it seem as if he was going to comp her meal. Funny did all for that just want what she ordered. Didn't give her the cheese that came with the meal, no refills on KOOLAID. I even asked if they had peach cobbler when I placed my order. He said yes, great I'm gonna get some. Nope he handed us the bill and basically told us to keep it push. Bad thing was it was slow. Time like that would be an up selling strategy. 30 minutes for the food to come out no cobbler, no sorry, no toast or cheese with the momma whites and over easy eggs that wasn't asked for. Really disappointing I wish I could put  half a star. I was so upset that I didn't even order my to go order because the service was terribly below standard. As a manager I would never allow my associates to perform at average or below. This business has come a long way since Phoenix. SMH brand standards and above.",

My MIL came in physically about 30 mins after we left and was told that the toys were never found. One of the toys was a rattle with sentimental value as it was a rattle used by my husband when he was a baby. My husband, who has experience in the service industry calls and speaks to a manager who says she spoke to the busboy and the busboy claims there were no toys. Now my husband gets angry because we know we left them there and demands that the manager go through the trash. Of course the manager was not thrilled. She did find our toys in the trash. So the bus boy was not only a lazy ass who didn't go above and beyond by saving our toys but actually lied about it. We aren't planning on coming anymore although my MIL still loves the place.",

    "text": "I soooo wanted to give this place 5 stars, and based on the food taste & quality, it would have been....however, our first visit was less than stellar.   We must have been seated at the \"black hole\" table that is somehow cloaked in invisibility.    After watching for a half hour while multiple servers passed us by and waited on everyone else around us, we were finally able to flag one of them down....which wasn't an easy task in and of itself!   Finally....we ordered.   OK, good, fresh food takes a while to cook...I understand that and am fine with waiting.....but the drinks took another 15 minutes to get to us.    By now, I'm feeling as if we are being punished for asking someone to do their job, and had been nothing but cordial and understanding.    The food was outstanding!   The chicken & waffles is a must have item (I'm Southern and the chicken there took me back to my Grandma's chicken), and my husband's burger was wolfed down.     Not once did our waitress come back to check to see if we needed anything else...granted, their drinks are served in quart mason jars, but I had tea where all of the ice had melted and a side glass of ice would have been nice had I ever been able to ask for it.  We figured we just had a bad experience, and decided to go back a 2nd & 3rd time....with the same results.     The wait staff there is nothing short of horrible....or VERY poorly trained.   I swear they actually try to hide from customers.    I will still eat there....but carry out only.   No one has time for a 2 1/2-hour meal when it isn't a 7-course one.  The place was half empty all 3 times we visited when it should have been dinner service rush, and it isn't the food that is causing that problem.   If I were the owner, I would take these reviews seriously, and get a consultant in to help improve customer service, as that is the only reason you don't have a line out the door.   Your business will fail because of the poor service, and that's the only reason you got 3 stars instead of 5.     I so want to try breakfast there to see if it's better than dinner service, but no way I'm taking a chance on wasting that much time.",

    "text": "Finally  tried this place after a few months of their grand opening.  We were sitted fairly quick but it took a long time for the waitress to came and ask us for our drinks. By the time she had a  chance  to check on us  we already knew what we wanted so we all ordered our drinks and food at the same time. It took another 20 minutes for us  to get  our drinks and different  waitress  came out with our drinks. I ordered the banana nut caramel  pancakes with no nuts. My husband  ordered  the lolos special which was the waffles and chicken. My niece had the shrimp and grits and my sister in law had the salmon  croquette  salad. The food took probably 40 minutes to come out and again a diffrent waitress brought it out. The place was not  busy  at the time so were surprised  that our drinks and food took a long time. The food was just ok. My pancakes had banana slices but no caramel.  The grits had a weird  after taste but the shrimp  was good. The salmon salad was just ok and the chicken and waffles  was also just ok. No one check to see if we needed a refill. The tables close to us was also looking  for any waitresses for refills. When we finally  saw a waitress  we ask if we could  get our  bill and her response  was \" sorry I'm  not your waitress\" so we flagged our waitress. I wont be coming  back to this establishment.  The long wait and lack of customer service is not worth it for me. We really  wanted to like this place especially  it's  just 2 minutes away from home but I'd rather just get some Popeyes  or KFC down the street.",

    "text": "Just so management is aware, one of your employees dined at Babystacks Cafe and I was seated next to him with my kids. He was wearing his Lo-lo's uniform, wreaked of alcohol, was still visibly drunk, was rude to the food server, complained that his crepes were cold (after letting it sit for 20 minutes), ate ALL of his food and then had the audacity to complain to the server and manager to get his meal comped since he didn't enjoy the food (which, again, he FINISHED). If these are the types of employees you want to represent your \"brand,\" I will spread the word that no one dine at Lo-lo's. For someone that is in customer service, to treat another person like total crap is unacceptable. You might be asking if the server was giving horrible service...the answer is no. He tended to my party of 4 with no problems, along with every other table he had. Here's a tip: Make sure your employees are out of uniform before they make total asses of themselves and misrepresenting your \"brand.\"",

It is in a  great location but the service is severely poor. We were greeted by a hottest who was very nice and cleared a booth for my dad and i. She later brought us waters and said our server will be right out . I decided to go on yelp to look at all the foods and we quickly got even more excited. We talked and decided what we wanted and waited. We waited over 20 mins before anyone even acknowledged we were there. We tried to stare, even flag down some servers but we're ignored. One server came over but then decided to talk to the booth next to us instead and not once did he reply with I'll be right with you, onw moment or anything . Very rude. We flagged another server who didn't want to talk to us. I felt it. We asked could we order please with someone. So we told him what we wanted and he returned with side plates which were dirty. I told my dad I'm sorry but with service like that I don't want to be here. It made me feel horrible. I have over 10 years experience in the industry.  I won't ever come back. I felt bad most for my dad.",

We stared at the hostess and another worker just chilling at the counter for a good 7 minutes and tried to say hi before they acknowledged us. She then rolled her eyes & asked if there was 4 of us, peered over the counter to see open tables, and yelled there's a booth over there...but then she didn't seat us....we just stood there awkwardly and she yelled another worker over and said sit them at that booth and the worker said \"I ain't a hostess\" and she yelled back \"you are today!\" Then we were handed menus as we were walking & then seated at the wrong booth. We sat around another 15 mins before someone asked us for our drink order and when we tried to order our server knew nothing about the menu...the menu has literally like 20 items....we tried to call over 7 wait staff just to get some sauces for our chicken as well as the missing order and no one acknowledged us. As we paid our check for the slowest service in our lives we didn't even care to get our extra change back because we knew it would take forever. Then he put the money down on our table and started counting it? Wtf  Chicken was dry af but the sides were delicious. They are known for their chicken so I was confused. Definitely try there corn fritters, fried green beans, and candy sweets. Fruit punch kool aid that tasted like watermelon jolly ranchers was a nice touch.",

When she finally arrived with our food, my friends spinach was cold, she doesn't have ranch like she asked for multiple times, and I still didn't have a single slice of lemon. I asked her for some lemons when she finally showed up with ranch sauce. She told me they were out of lemons. I thought \"ok well that's not a big deal.\" Until.... SHE SHOWED UP WITH AT LEAST 4 MORE DRINKS FROM THE BACK THAT HAD LEMONS IN IT! Why even lie? 1.5 hours to get food, eat for 5 minutes, get aggravated, and leave.  Food isn't worth it.

We were happy&  excited to hear they opened doors out here in LV so we decided to put it on the must do list...Why did we do that, on the day we did?? We were greeted promptly then it was all bad from there. Found a seat for our party and put in our drink orders n ordered an appetizer. Got our kool-aid n was catfish in decent time, but man, after that, ...all downhill like... We decided on menu items n placed order, n that was literally the last time we saw our waitress (at least at our table) We waited and waited and waited after about 45-50 min our food finally made it to the table, by another table staff ( thank you) I appreciate her for not forgetting about us...  Absolutely No check in after getting our drinks. An occasional , \"do you need anything\", \"how's is everything with your drink/appetizer\" or not even \"how's everything\"??? absolutely no follow up with our table. We got better service at the gas station filling up before driving there from across town. .. We ordered the red velvet pancakes and they came with some type of \"orange flavored\"  (not cream cheese) cream cheese icing.. (Usually cream cheese n powdered sugar) clearly this was not. Absolutely gross, not eating that,n made the red velvet cakes dry not even worth attempting to eat. (Shoulda just went to baby stacks). I got the Lo lo's : was 3 pieces of chx n waffle, eggs n grits. Grits were drowned in /margarine or whatever they drowned them in, too much tho. Waffle Taste like cinnamon, not how I've had any waffle ever before. They must be tweaking recipes bc the food wasn't made this way in AZ.. Either way just a word of advice to mgmt, train your wait staff on customer service bc we would have immediately notified of the discrepancies but they were nowhere to b found, since bringing the drink order to our table she was GHOST!!The chx was ok, nothing to write home about or compel me to return and pay for underwhelming food, NO table service, no thanks. Making bad even worse, after we decided against allowing them to \"make it right\" since we see the place filling up by the minute and it already took 45 to get our food, n no follow up, we decided,\"mmmm good, miss me w that shhh\" we decided to just let fellow yelpers read this and consider yourself warned.. Not sure if personality is considered when hiring but, there's too many options out here to eat at, as far as Lo lo's LV, I'll pass, one n done..  \"Check Please\"....and a box so I can make this not a complete loss, my dog may like it.  Hold up, now All of a sudden, out of the sky, it's a bird, no it's a plane, NOoo, it's; \"Our waitress\" where UUUU BEEN AT??? Lol., And now it's time to leave and you \"hover\" and carefully watch us sign our receipt?  us table while we are signing our receipts as if we are going to bless you gracefully for not even checking on us 1x while we are there. I'm cool, were cool, completely cool off Lo-Lo's in LV..  Wats with the customer service here ????????",

We saw they were somewhat busy so we decided to take a seat at the bar as there were several open seats available and we figured we might get serviced quicker. About 5 minutes after sitting at her bar the bar tender greeted us and let us know that the wait time for food was about 40-45 minutes. We thanked her for letting us know before ordering and decided to stay since we did not need to be anywhere for a few hours. The bartender was very kind and she took our order and got our drinks to us as quickly as she could. Well, about 50 minutes into waiting we noticed that no one in the car area was receiving any food. The bartender came over to us to let us know it would be coming out soon. Another 20 minted pass (now an hour into waiting) and she comes back and says she is going to go to the back to see what's going on with our order (by this time everyone else at the bar had their food and was done eating). She went to the kitchen and didn't come back. We sat there for another 30 minutes (I know I know we were being very patient with them), before we just gave up and left. We couldn't believe how unorganized and unprofessional the service was that we received that day. Will never give this establishment  any of my money. It's one thing to say they made a mistake but it's another to just leave and not return to communicate with us.",

It looked like instant mash potatoes. In all, I will never come back.",

Very friendly and helpful...asked about the Mac and cheese and she brought a sample to the table to try it out!       Started out with some corn fritters...a tasty way to start things off.  Nicely spicy, although the accompanying honey mustard could've used some help from an alternative sauce to mix it up a bit.       For the main event I ordered chicken and a waffle with sweet potatoes and corn bread.  Sweet potatoes were okay, but unfortunately they were out of corn bread at the time so we were served a homemade biscuit instead.  The biscuit was huge!  The waffle was huge and delicious as well, but my favorite part was the chicken.  Nice crispy skin and juicy inside.  Some of the best fried chicken I've had in a while.  All in all a very satisfying meal.        After we were done eating Tinisha brought us to-go drinks and the corn bread that wasn't available earlier.  She really made it a great experience.  Will definitely return!!",

I ordered the shrimp and grits,  with hot links on the side, extra extra burnt.. delish!!! Of course i ordered more than i could eat.. oh, i forgot to mention, the GREEN APPLE KOOLAID!!! So good yall.. but like i stated before, i ordered more than i could eat at the time.    I went to the wash room, leaving my portfolio sitting on the table.. when i came back, my food was gone, but there was a fresh glass of koolaid left on the table,  with my check next to it... so I waited for Sparkey, my server to come back with my food in a to go container.. he never did,  so i stood up and he came by to tell me that he takes care of the check.. i asked him, where is my food... he said , \"oh, i threw it in the trash\".. took the check book out of my hand and proceeded to go to the computer to finalise the bill... i asked, so you throw my food away, and expect me to pay this full bill? He said \"yes, i thought you had left\".. im like...\"but my stuff was still on the table, and you left me a fresh glass if koolaid\", hes now showingly pissed.. i said \"you throw my food in the trash, without closing out with me, and your pissed about it?\" He says you can talk to my manager..... the manager comes, and tells me that they will make me another meal... no sir.. its cold in here,  and i don't have time to wait for you guys to cook it, i have somewhere to be... he told me that i must pay the bill.... i did.  I asked how long has sparky been serving.. thats when i was told that after the incident with my food.. he snapped at the hostesses about folding napkins.   Ive never had my food thrown out and had to pay for it... never.. there was a full bowl of shrimp and grits left, i had only eaten four bites.. the bowl is hughe! But what gets me is that my belongings were still at the table, and he had given me a fresh glass of koolaid.. but, he says he thought id left without paying my bill...  Any one else would have lost their minds about this... ive never had this happen to me.. there was a woman in the restroom with her disabled mother trying to get the mom together.. but i was not away from the table long enough to throw my food away.. and if my things were still there... why would he, without asking me?",

We sat there for 10 minutes, watched her serve other people. She finally said to us, \"I'll be with you in a minute\" she then takes her time to make someone's drink, took her time, and boxed someone's order, offered to sell them a shirt. Not even offering to serve water or take our order. After 20 minutes of no service, no smile, we walked out.  We felt disrespected, and walked out!! This was our first visit, and LAST visit. I will let other people know this is how you will be treated at this restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm giving this a 3 star only because of the 1 not so great experience I had today.   Im a multiple time returning customer, I used to live around the corner for about a year or so and I would visit Lo-Lo's all the time. I've never had a problem with this place until I came in today with my father in law. I was embarrassed because I pumped Lo-Lo's up by telling him, that in my opinion Lo-Lo's was better than Roscoes.   It all began as soon as we got there, I should've noticed the red flag and turned away today. But I didn't, even after overhearing a gentle grieve over the fact that he called the day before to confirm the restaurant had his credit (in which they said they did). Not to find out that when he returned the following day it was no where to be found.   When we were finally seated, it took about 17 minutes for the only waitress (Dre or Drai) to address us by saying she would be right with us. The poor thing wasn't able to get back to us until roughly 30 minutes after we were seated to take our order. I asked her if she had any help and she said she was the only one working today.   So 20-30 minutes after we placed our order our waitress (Dre or Drai) came out to inform us that our grits wouldn't be ready for another 20 minutes. I don't about anyone else but I was raised on grits and they take max 10 Mins to make. So after waiting for our food for 40-50 Mins it finally came out. The waffles were subpar at best this time, but everything else was solid.   To say the least our waitress was great minus the fact that she didn't have any help for majority of the morning. The manager could've been and should've been way more proactive in helping his employees out. I dont know exactly what he duties are but I'm assuming, ownership wants the guest to have the best experience possible so that they don't leave wanting to write a review like this.   I would normally suggest Lo-Lo's to all of my friends and family that visit Las Vegas but I'm not sure that I want to send anyone else that way because i don't want to sign off on a place if they're going to continue service of such.",

For lunch I had Sheedas special which came with 2 pieces of chicken (breast &wing) and a waffle. The waffle was Bomb! Tasted like cinnamon.  Chicken was hot, fresh and juicy. It was very flavorful, but i do think it needed just a tad bit more salt or seasoning.  I also had a side of yams.  The yams were maybe the best I've tasted. So good!!! My hubby had the shrimp and grits which he liked, but said they were spicy and the menu did not specify that it was a spicy dish. It was all good though because he likes spicy food.  All and all I thought the food was really good. I would definitely eat there again. Just took off a 1/2 star because i think the chicken needed more seasoning.  Other than that, really good experience.",

Upon entering it was very clean and the atmosphere was nice. My dad and sister were already there so they just waved me over. Our waitress Veronica was very nice and attentive A+. She was on it. We had an  appetizer which consisted of 3 for 20 my sister got fried green tomatoes (to die for) my dad got catfish beignets (awesome) and I wanted chicken gizzards (not available)  got the corn fritters (tasty) but not what I wanted. I'm a southern girl and that's what I wanted to try. The grits were like I like em and my eggs were over easy. I'm not a fan of cheese and onions on my grits. I also ordered the KKs 3 pieces of mixed chicken and 2 waffles. Everything was hot when it came out. The waffles were on the soft side, which is fine with me. My dad likes his crispy. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because I wanted my doggone gizzards and the owner of Lo Lo's ex pro basketball player Kevin Johnson was walking around talking to patrons at different tables, but never once stopped at ours. If you are checking on people that are bringing you business, make sure that includes everyone that is occupying a seat. I don't give a damn who you are and I am in no way star struck. But we are spending money there and you are benefiting from my business and these comments. Other wise the food was enjoyable. Management I would give 1 .",

We went when they first opened and thought it was ok, but the second time was horrible and said I'd never go again until...........  New management  5/27/18 First time back in forever and there's a line that took some time to move through. I was confused as to why, but the young lady in front is taking the names and seating the people as well. She finally gets to us and I tell her we're a party of 9. She then tells me they'll set up the table and it'll be 25-30 mins. A large party maybe 10-12 comes as I'm waiting and they go through the same process,  however they're sat immediately. I'm annoyed, but I ignored it because my full party hadn't arrived yet. They arrive and a host pops out and is asking if everyone has been helped... She noticed I was still sitting there and rushed away to get our table ready. We get seated at 11:45.  The server came over to take our drink order at 12:05. She forgot our straws and brought them in to go cups because they were out of the mason jars they use... she came back to take our food order at 12:20. My nephew wants pancakes but their machine was down soooooo no pancakes,  however his dad noticed that other tables got pancakes.  We're waiting and I notice the large party they seated before me is still waiting. They're starting to get agitated. The table directly to the left of us was still waiting and they were there for a WHILE, but their food is on the way to the table. It gets there and the young lady examines the plate then places it on the edge of the table, so they grab the first server they saw and tell them the order is wrong. she apologizes and tells her she'll go get her server and when she gets there she grabs their food, goes into the kitchen, then walks it out to another table across the restaurant. It's 1:30. I ask how much longer it'll be and I'm told it'll be out shortly. At 1:40 she passes me again. My brother tells her the kids are getting antsy and very hungry. She then tells us it'll be a while because there are a lot of orders before ours and it'll be another 30 minutes. That's when we decided to leave at 1:45.  Just never go there and you'll be fine; if you want chicken and waffles go else where to maybe Grits Cafe! Skip over M&Ms as I have a horror story about them as well.",

Their food is simply awesome...served hot, fresh, and the choices and taste of the main and side dishes is unreal. Lo-lo's prices are crazy good. Tremendous value.   We recently visited with family from Sacramento and all seven in our party raved about this restaurant. In addition to great food at a great price the staff was awesome. Both friendly and efficient. Indeed a rare find in this day and age.   Wish I could award 10 stars for this establishment because it had earned it with me. Love it...love it... Do yourself a favor and check this place out soon!!",

We are from Ca and spent 2 long hours getting our food not to mention the wait just to be seated. The food was average and salty. And then the manager told us oh u only waited an hour. All in all it was not worth my time which I can't get back. No I will not be returning",

To our surprise, the experience was amazing. The staff was attentive, our water was apologetic for the wait on our drinks and our koolaid levels  never hit the bottom. Everyone was friendly, and approachable. I will definitely be back again. The owner and management sets the tone for their staff & the new owner did just that. Congratulations on new beginnings and much success.thanks again!!!",

For the amount that it came to i would have went to Popeyes and Mario's and would have better flavors then this. My banana pancakes were eh ok but the banana fosters from ihop are better. The seasoned glory greens were just that greens that came out the can. This restaurant has not been open that long and honestly I don't feel like it will be open that much more longer based on the flavor of the food. If it was just off service yes but this will be my first and last time visiting Lo-los  in Las Vegas.  Just the service is why this place gets a 3  Food gets a 2",

When they have food all on their uniforms or are sweating and serving...that turns me off completely. But the food was beyond great. I loved that strawberry butter they serve with the waffles and needed an extra. The bathroom needed to be tidied up as well. I blame that on other women know when they go in there and they make a total mess. That's totally inexcusable for a woman to leave it that way. Dry the sink counter off when you're done drying your hands... Toilet paper shouldn't be on the floor either ladies!!! Honestly, that's just lazy women!!! Great restaurant overall. Enjoy",

    "text": "You might not be able to find cheaper chicken and waffles in town. Their menu has a whole page devoted to different variations of the dish, based on the amount and type of chicken and number of waffles. I went with the Lil Amadi at the super low price of $7, consisting of one thigh, one drumstick, and one waffle. The chicken was better than expected with a crunchy, crisp exterior and well seasoned, tender meat underneath. The cinnamon in the waffle was noticeable right away. I could smell it as the plate was being set down in front of me. Thin, with edges slightly crispy, but the overall texture was one of a soft, pliable, chewy waffle. A warm dispenser of maple syrup was provided too. Not a bad meal at all, but far from the top notch versions found elsewhere around town.  One order of cornbread is fairly massive. It's a large muffin topped with a scoop of butter. The bottom and outside edges were firm, while the inside was moist and quite chewy with bits of corn worked in.  The service at the bar was great -- friendly and attentive. The selection of beer, on the other hand, was pretty sad. Beers on tap included Bud, Bud light, a cider and something that was like Busch light. It would have been nice if they could get some local brews for their taps instead.   This place may not offer the best southern food around, but the price and portion sizes are strong reasons to pay this place a visit.",

Not too sweet or tart. I had a side of sauteed spinach and sweet corn. I sampled my family's plates and everything was amazing.  Husband had \"CHYNA'S HONEY HOTS\" which is 6 wings splashed with Chyna's honey & hot sauce combo, served with ranch.   Rosa was our server and did such a lovely job. She was on top of everything we requested and the manager Jeff came over and thanked us for our service after we asked for military discount. That was very nice.  lol the whole place felt welcoming and very clean. The restrooms were clean and well stocked. No complaints what so ever. Oh I would have liked kids nuggets or tenders, pizza, or meatballs on the kids menus...  Wait time to be seated was great and the time from when we placed our order to the time all of the food came out was 7-10min. Portions were huge and I feel like we got our monies worth. Thank you!!!",

This was my first time here and I really loved the fried gizzards we ordered it was sooo tender and very flavorful seasoning a bit too much but still really good. I didn't really like the gravy on the chicken for the \"Baby Rays\" dish but that was my fault I should of just ordered \"Lo Lo's\" dish but the waffles made up for it big time loved the seasoning they put in it. My waitress went above a beyond to change out my waffles after she split syrup all over it making her way to the table and the new waffles came fast. Also what I really loved was the fact she gave me a to-go cup for my soda with my food container without me asking for one first. It's like she knew what I wanted in my head. Sad thing is I forgot I didn't get her name and I didn't keep the receipt.",

    "text": "Well, if this place were called Lo-Los Customer Service, they'd get 5 stars. They are always friendly and kind. Their food, however, is not up to par with other chicken and waffles places. I tried this place twice. Once right after they opened, and once last night. I thought that they had opening jitters so I gave them another shot.   Chicken--- Both times, the smaller pieces (legs and wings) were heavily overcooked. I'm not a chicken cooking expert, but you cant cook a huge breast with tons of meat and a tiny wing with little meat for the same amount of time and expect the same results. One of the pieces last night tasted like it was cooked in old frying grease.   Waffle- Both times the waffle was OK taste wise. But both times it was cold, not hot at all.   Sides- Had the cole slaw on my visit last night. Very tasty.  Drinks- On the 1st visit, they did not have their liquor license. Last night, I had the Lo-Lo's Punch (Kool-Aid, Vodka, Pineapple Juice). It was very good.  On my 1st visit they were VERY busy and people were waiting for food. When I went last night, not so busy. The chicken wasn't HOT. They need to find a balance to their demand to keep food hot and fresh.   Good luck to them!!!!",

    "text": "First i would like to say that they food was OK, waffles and chicken were great ... However my husband got a burger and added fries (they didnt say there was an extra charge) i assumed it came with fries because they usually do.. the burger was 12$ and fries 2$ more... whatever, we found out after we got the receipt ... I got the Chicken fried steak dinner and it was ok, WAY TO SALTY for me... i ate a quarter of the portion, the mac n cheese was average Boxed mac n cheese... the Collard greens were good but again too salty... the cornbread was on point! delicous... We had the fried green tomatoes as and those were good... the thousand island was ok... OH i got MelonMojio and it was HORRIBLE all sugar and not good :/ i didnt finish it either... The husband got the Lo-Lo's Beer and it was warm... they came around and filled it up w/o asking and was charged again.. very understandable but they shouldve asked... the second time around the beer was a lil colder... we showed up at 5:30 and it wasnt that packed... we didnt leave til 7:30... the server guy was cool but the wait time took waaaaaaaay to long... i had my 2 kids and they were hungry... i couldve went home and cooked faster but we wanted to give this place a try... at the end of our meal we got the bill and the guy gave me the wrong bill... so i asked for mine and it was 76$ that to me was just a lil too much for not so great food and especially waiting... my kids got chicken n waffles and they loved it.. i would just only get chicken and waffles from this place... nothing else... maybe water too... but yea... this is just my POV :)",

Got there at 730 just got home it's now after 10pm.   The hostess station is completely clueless!! They told us an hour wait. We were willing to wait but oddly I could see multiple tables in the bar area and patio that had available seating. That was not offered. When I asked about them seats I was told I'd have to wait because their were many people ahead of us... 15 minutes later seats still open smh waitress walks up and says wanna sit with me.. so she just sat us :) cool But from there we waited well over an hour before we got our food. I watched multiple parties so frustrated over the wait they just left..  When our food did arrive it was tasty but I think we will wait a few months before returning.. That place needs some serious help. I'd probably rerate in a few months.  So this review is more or less a warning at this point. The waitresses are under stress the kitchens way behind and the hostess station has no idea about what's avail on their floor.. Fingers crossed they find some experienced managers. QUICK",

Chicken was good but highly disappointed with the thin flavorless waffle.... We finished our meals hoping our appetizer would appear during... But we reminded the waiter..

We had a party of about 6... the chicken was seasoned well, the waffles were tasty, the grits were nice & creamy and the kool aid was on point!!!!

They also serve kook aid in several different flavors, also in large mason jars!  They have a full bar and serve waffles and pancakes all day as well as dinner items and appetizers!  The portions are large, but the prices are good.  We had the soul food choices, which feature several different options that come with two sides and the best, corn bread muffins!  My husband had two fried catfish fillets with Cole slaw and fried okra.  I had chicken fried chicken, which was a huge boneless chicken fillet, smothered in white, sausage gravy, sauteed zucchini and yellow squash and the best macaroni and cheese that I ever had and a large, sweet and tasty, corn bread muffin!  The price for all of those items were just $15.00!  You can't beat that price!  I had to take half of my dinner home to eat later.  There is many sides that you can add to your dinner for a minimal price.  We got a fluffy, home made biscuit, smothered in white, sausage gravy.  So good!  There is also some yummy looking desert options, but I'm always too full to try them!  The reason that I only gave them 4 stars is because the tables and chairs are not very comfortable and a tad low for me.  I also agree with other reviews that the service could be better.  It's not that it's bad service, but a bit slow and our waiter kept forgetting things.  All in all, though, it is well worth a visit!   We love going there!  The managers always come around and ask how your dinner is and the staff is friendly!",

Before I start...Nate the manager is the ONLY reason we didn't walk out the door. The waitress Bre... she's the absolute worst waitress we've ever seen!! They should know that a horrible waitress will reflect on the entire restaurant. First, we waited 40 minutes to be seated, that's fine....we were advised of the wait time. We were seated at a middle table, party of 4 adults and a baby. After 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order I got up and spoke to the host. Finally after a few more minutes waitress Bre came. She was full of excuses on why she neglected us. She then claimed if we wanted anything from the bar it would be a 15 minute wait because the alcohol was on the truck outside, which we later learned was a lie. We ordered water, soda, tea and one beer. She came back about 25 minutes later with the drinks except for the beer. She said she forgot and took off again. 15 minutes later still waiting on the beer we decided to chase her down again. Meanwhile we're actually noticing tables ALL around us, who were seated between 10-30 minutes after us, receiving their food. I chased Bre down again!! More excuses. It was obvious at this point she appeared to be refusing service without actually saying it. We asked for the manager....Nate came. We explained what was going on and he stepped up and got the food to us. The food actually seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp in the kitchen because it was definitely not freshly plated and they brought it out in a hurry once I pointed out that every surrounding table was seated long after we were and had already received their meals......including many other tables being served by BRE! Why were WE being ignored by this lady? Even when we asked her for napkins...she took a long time, threw one on the table and attempted to walk off but he caught her so she dropped three more on the table. Even the to-go boxes!! She disappeared and never brought them. Nate had to get us boxes. This was beyond ridiculous! We arrived at 1:40pm and left at 4:04pm with half our food in to-go boxes. We were so incredibly frustrated and infuriated. We were a group of cousins who had not seen each other in 8 years.....thanks for ruining our lunch/reunion Bre. If the owner reads this....Nate is a good man and did his best to save our experience. He should NOT have to do that girls job! We're not sure we'll ever return. The food was not worth the complete train wreck our experience turned out to be.",

I believe this was a soft opening because they only had a limited menu so that's why I give four stars instead of 5. Onto the food, I got the #8 and a side of collard greens. The breading on the chicken was the proper ratio of crunchy, soft, grease, and bread. The chicken breast was plump and juicy. The waffle was light, fluffy and had a hint of some flavor I couldn't quite detect. I ultimately decide how good a soul food joint is by their collard greens. These were perfectly cooked. Salty and spicy were two most prevalent notes. Overall I'm thoroughly impressed and will be returning to try more things 4 stars.",

The food was delicious! The chicken was crispy as well as seasoned (it's very rare when you experience both crispy and seasoned at restaurants). My sister had shrimp and grits that was also delicious. The drinks were amazing also. We will definitely be visiting this place again if we ever come back to Las Vegas.",

There wasn't really many people, but im going to assume because it was 2pm. After lunch and right before dinner.  We sat at 2:55pm. Took us about 10 minutes to decide. I ask the waitress what \"grits\" was and she said it was oatmeal. I then googled it.... not oatmeal. Anyways we ordered and waited...for a long time. The waitress made eye contact with us, asked if we needed more water. Not kool-aid, just water. We decided to leave at 350... because we just had waited too long. We didnt know it then but the waitress came and told us they were making our chicken extra chrispy, when im reality she had forgotten to put our order in.  We politely left... the staff and management went above and beyond to bring us back into the restaurant and make a positive experience. We ate for free, food is ok. But again the 1 star is for the fact that we're seated and forgotten about for an hour. I spent a total of 2 hours here, on a day i missed work to be with my family. Im thankful for the effort the management and staff put in after wards but i would most likely never go back.",

The waitress that we had to stop in order to get service told us repeatedly that she had NO idea who was waiting on our section of tables, but she'd \"get us out the way\". We saw people seated long after us being served before us. When we FINALLY got our food, my chicken and waffle was stone cold. Then we had to wait ANOTHER 15 minutes to get our check. Manager was supposed to be giving us a free dessert for our trouble, but THAT was another 20 minutes in waiting, and we had to leave without it because we'd already spent WAY too much of our day there.

Oh and their cocktail are pretty good too. They have some interesting selections like, Kool-Aid and gin. Service is fast and friendly. The establishment is very clean, you can choose between booths, tables, and bar. I think some high tables too. Prices are pretty low, your wallet won't take much of a hit :)",

    "text": "A couple of people at work raved about how Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles made it's way to Vegas and I had to give it a try.  I came on Friday around 3 and luckily that's when their Happy Hour starts!  (HH 3-6PM). Appetizers are $5 (except for the catfish beignets) and draft beer is $1 off.  We started off with some catfish beignets and fried gizzards.  And I opted for their namesake Lo-Lo's, which comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.    Catfish beignets: Large pieces of flakey catfish, with a nice crisp breading.  It comes with a dipping sauce that tastes like thousand islands dressing, but the best way to eat it is to douse it in hot sauce!    Fried gizzards: Definitely an acquired taste if you aren't used to it.  It's a little chewy.  I didn't care too much for it because I was all over the catfish.    Lo-Lo's: The 3 pieces of chicken were huge!  1 large chicken breast was enough to fill me up.   The breading was a little too salty for my taste, so I ripped off the skin and went straight to the meat.  The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly (after getting past all the breading).  The waffles were a bit soggy (before adding any syrup).  I wish they toasted it a little longer to crisp it up.  All in all, soggy waffles wouldn't deter me from enjoying my meal.  Flavor was great!  I loved how the chicken paired well with the hint of cinnamon in the syrup and butteriness from the waffles.    All in all, the food was just okay for me.  Service was a little slow despite the restaurant being empty.  My favorite part of the meal was enjoying old school R&B playing in the background.",

Sat down in the bar area and really had a look at the place. The place is nice and the staff seemed friendly. Honestly, I didn't expect that.   Now onto the C & W. The Waffles were pretty good and the chicken sucks. Ok, I'm done. Thank you so much for reading.",

They told us they would text us when our table was ready so we killed sometime and waited for the text. When we got our table we weren't greeted by anyone or even got our drink order. We arrived here at 3:30 mind you and didn't get our drink order till 3:45 it is now 4:41 and we still haven't gotten our food. I was just told by our waitress that our food was behind two more tickets and it would be another 5 minutes so by the time we get our food it would have been almost 1 and half hour. Also let me remind you the place is not packed or crowded. What a joke never coming back I should've left and canceled our order. Who ever owns this place needs to take care of what's happening here because after reading some of the reviews sounds like we weren't the only ones that has had this experience  Update, this is a late update so here's what happened when we got our food, just so you know we were a group of 11 people. And also remember the place wasn't packed at all. Our food came and they brought each plate out one by one. Not 2 by 2 or 3by 3 but one by one.",

The dranks reminded me of growing up where my grandmother would fix. I would highly recommend this place for any one who is looking for some REAL southern style cooking. Our server was so on point. She anticipated everything we needed. My grandbaby spilled his red koolaid and there was no hesitation cleaning it up and they replaced it in a to go cup.

    "text": "Incompetent. I only gave this place one star so I can leave this review.  When my boyfriend and I walked in, (my boyfriend is white and I am Filipino) I was like ok, ambiance seemed cool, the music is my taste and who doesn't like chicken and waffles? Boy, were we wrong to choose this place. If you are not of darker shade then what I am, don't expect the same welcome as everyone else.   We asked for a booth and the girl seating us TOLD us where to sit. Didn't SHOW us to our seats. Should have known that it was going to be bad. Once seated our server didn't greet us right away. We looked through the menu and drank menu and after 10 mins she finally came.  Mind you, this is our very first time here.   We ordered our drinks, my boyfriend ordered a Fat Tire beer and I ordered an OJ with an extra glass of ice. After a few mins, the bartender came up and told us they didn't have Fat Tire, so instead he ordered a Coors Lite. Then after another 5-6 mins, the bartender told us they didn't have coors lite. If you can't even stock coors lite at your establishment and you have a drink menu that is supposedly stocked as a full bar, then you should take away the whole thing. Come on, it's a Sunday and people will be drinking if you say you have a full bar!!! Anyways he just decided to get water. For water, you would still have to wait.   Now it has been a good 15-20 mins and we didn't get our food ordered because they couldn't find any beers at their bar. Finally! Virginia our server, comes back with water and OJ and gets our food order. My boyfriend ordered Ivan's chorizo scramble with potatoes. Just like in the picture on their menu and I ordered the #9 two piece chicken with one waffle.  After another 15-20 mins, someone other than Virginia, brought our food over. Virginia did not come over to Check on us to make sure our food that came over was good. Unfortunately, my boyfriends order was wrong. He ordered the Ivan's chorizo scramble and asked for over easy eggs instead with potatoes. Eggs were over hard, there were no potatoes, the chorizo looked like dog food and they charge you an extra $1 for potatoes and there weren't any.   After leaving the plate at the end of the table, finally someone noticed after a good 10 mins that my boyfriend wasn't eating. Told them this is not what he ordered and we wanted to speak to a manager. I ate my food in 10 mins so we could get outta there and still no manager.   Still no manager, still no server, still bad service. We were waiting for the check for so long that if we decided to just walk out they probably wouldn't even notice.  The place was not packed at all, there were many employees around doing tasks and no customer servicing.   Finally got our check, and they took out my boyfriend's order. So we started to feel a little better about the place, but when they gave me the credit card receipt to sign, they charged me more than what the original receipt was. What, they charged me extra for a \"white boy tax\".?!?? I was so upset, by this time we were both livid. So livid about our experience that I wasn't going to wait another hour for them to fix it. I attached a picture of both receipts and you tell me how this is right. It's not, it's criminal. This place is a joke. DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all.",

We got there around 12pm. We had a party of 4, and were told about 30 to 45 minutes. Didn't sit down till about 1:30. It was odd because we saw a lot of empty tables. Out curiosity we asked and they said it's because the kitchen is backed up, so they weren't seating anyone because of it. Anyway, ordered our food, didn't get it until about 2:00pm. Should probably mention that only half our party's plates came out while the other half had to wait even longer because they ran out of what they ordered. So half the group is eating, other half is waiting. On top of another group who was complaining that they were here first and we got half our meals before they even got one of their meals. 2:45 came around and the other half of our group finally got their meals. You could honestly tell they were rushing cause the food was not up to par compared to when I first came there. Finally we left around 3:15. I understand on a Sunday, and Labor Day weekend a lot of places will be slammed. But you think you'd be prepared for that kind of situation. We could've driven to California with how long it took, and got some Roscoes Chicken & Waffles instead.",

First, we didn't catch his name, but the gentleman in the kitchen came out repeatedly to correct the major deficiencies in service we experienced. I applaud him for stepping in! This was the ONLY reconciling piece of this visit. The service was horrible.   After ordering drinks (which were awful), they finally took our food order -- 30m after we arrived.   Then when we FINALLY got our 5 orders which was another 30min. Ery'thang was cold. Every last order, catfish, chicken, waffles, eggs were lukewarm (border on cold). This is not acceptable. The gentleman I aforementioned (he may have been the cook) came  to help and remedy.  He offered a discount on the food and comp'd a meal. We were not aggressive, but it was clear that we were extremely dissatisfied, but he maintained his cool.  This was not a good experience. Food was over cooked, bland, and the bar drinks though creative at first blush, lacked any meaningful flavor or alcohol.  Then we had to beg and wait  (20 minutes )for the bill.

    "text": "Update: Seems the restaurant is under new ownership and the place has turned around. There is new staff here and the service is totally turned around. The food is still good as it was previously. My kids love it here and ask to go all the time. I am writing this review on Sunday morning and now we might have to make a pit stop for some breakfast. Yummmm.   I am changing my review. My husband and I came here this afternoon and there was no hostess for a good 5 minutes. Then she comes and says the manager told her they are not taking anymore customers. Let me remind you the restaurant is not even full smh. My husband asks her why and she said there is a large party and that they can't handle the party and additional people. Just ridiculous. Large parties aren't new to restaurants why can't this establishment handle this? Very disappointing and unprofessional who turns away customers in the food business? A quick way to end a business. there are many others.",

    "text": "I've been to Lo-Lo's a few times and I've had good service each time. I have heard horror stories though. Thankfully, I don't have any of my own. That being said, let's discuss the food and service.   Each time, each waiter/waitress has been attentive, kind and sometimes friendly. I have yet to have the same waiter/waitress though I have seen them all each visit. I have been ONE time when it was busy and I learned then, never again. Not because service was bad, but because I was hungry and their seating procedures seemed to be unorganized at the time.   Food! I enjoyed my food at Lo-Lo's. My favorite are the fried green tomatoes. This last visit, I went against my norm and ordered Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits. I'll make this short. I won't order it again. The grits weren't seasoned and the tails were still on the shrimp. I requested them to be taken off but the kitchen decided against my request. WHY OH WHY keep the tails on is a MYSTERY to me. Yet so many restaurants do it. Dumb kitchen policy!! DUMB!  When my food came, I had to wait until it cooled a little so I could remove the tails. UGH! So bothersome to go through all that work and then have under-seasoned food. I was upset! I sprinkled black pepper on the plate, cut the shrimp and then remixed everything. I'm guessing the grits aren't seasoned because the shrimp is heavily seasoned and the cheese brings a level of salt on its own. Once I created a new dish in front of my own eyes, I ate every bite. That bowl was almost dish-washing clean when I was done. It wasn't that the new version of my meal was delicious. It was that I was almost in starvation mode. After creating a new mix, the dish itself was decent.   I will return to Lo-Lo's as it's been added to my \"must-eat-here\" list in Vegas. I just won't order Uncle Brotha's Shrimp and Grits again.",

Thankfully, the GM was eager to resolve the matter.  My husband and I ordered the fried okra, 3 wings & 2 waffles, 3 fingers & a waffle, and a side of fries. The fried okra tasted like my great aunt from Arkansas was in the kitchen cooking. The wings were well seasoned, and the fingers were dinosaur sized. 1.5 fingers is the equivalent of eating five fingers - no joke. The portion size of the fries were generous too. Cinnamony is the word that comes to mind to describe the waffles. They are not the star of the show, but make a decent co-star.   Full disclosure, Kool Aid was never served in my parent's home, so I'm not a Kool Aid aficionado, but my husband is. He claimed that their grape Kool Aid had the perfect sugar to water ratio. So, feel free to get a Jar of Drank.  The next time that I have a hankering for some soul food, I'll be sure to dine in (mid-week of course).",

We sat on the patio. It took the waitress forever to even come out and acknowledge that we were even there. It took her soooooo long to get us water, drinks, food order etc. we sat for at least 20 minutes before we got water. The waitress seemed like she was doing her best just swamped. We had some of the coaches for the game and had to be at the convention center so we were trying to get her move just a little faster but she wasn't. We were Complaining and getting agitated because everything was just taking too long. Then here came Russell.   Russell made every thing better! His customer service was top notch and he goes above and beyond. We waited so long He made sure the coaches food Came out immediately because they had to leave first. He came out there and took care of our table on the patio and another table of 4-5 ppl. Russell is the epitome of what customer service is he was friendly, Pleasant, and efficient. Also very quick on his toes and he made it happen.   Now we can get to the food the food was good. Chicken was excellent with the LoLo hot sauce!!!! Waffles were great. But the reason I would go back there is because of Russell. I'm from California and You can find fried chicken anywhere but outstanding customer service that's what really brings customers back!!!!!",

And there were plenty of waitstaff available... they just stayed focus on only specific tables for some reason. There were several other groups sitting with no food for a long time too and becoming visibly frustrated with the waitstaff. When we finally got our food it was not good at all. The waffles had a completely different texture, the chicken was dry and lacking flavor.  We were very sad to have such an unpleasant experience at one of our favorite places to eat.",

My husband and I come here about twice a month and I have to say, each time we dine here, the waiter or waitress is attentive to us. We have yet to have a bad experience with our meal, which is a plus. The atmosphere is substantial, and the staff are all friendly. I definitely reccomend coming here if you've never been. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "So I'm giving this place 1 star for my recent visit and most likely will never return to dine there. My first visit to Lo-Lo's, I've always seen it driving by so I stopped by one day with my family to try it out. I did read some of the reviews before deciding to eat there and saw that it had really bad service but I went anyway. When I got there I was amazed with the service. I was greeted when I walked in, was already suggested what to try since it was our first time and was seated immediately. Our server Keke did an amazing job that day and took really good care of us even tho we ordered a good amount of food we had no complaints. Keke was the reason why we went back again.   So my 2nd visit to Lo-Lo's, totally different. It was Labor Day( place was not packed, and a lot of empty tables) my girlfriend and I decided to eat here again because of how good the food and service was our first visit. When we got there, I spoke to the hostess she said there's a wait time for 10 minutes, so we waited. 15 minutes go by I go in and ask her how long more of a wait she now tells me she doesn't know it could be 10 or 15 more minutes since she is short staffed. So finally 30 minutes of waiting we finally get seated and we were happy and forgot about the wait we did. As we sat down waitress asked for our drink order which was great. Wrong! When our drinks came my girlfriends water had about 4 cubes in it and mine had none. Maybe a shortage on ice? I doubt that because I seen others in the restaurant with ice packed in their drink but I'm not the type to go make a complaint. So now the food ordering went good, we all put our orders in and the waiting game begins. So we wait and wait and wait. 30 minutes go by and we still have not gotten one dish to our table. So we start to notice everyone around us, a mother and child came in and was seated next to us. Not one person acknowledged them and even asked for a drink order. They literally sat there for 15 or more minutes and nothing. So they left, I don't blame them because I wish I done the same since the beginning of all this. So we continue to wait for our food and we notice the chef manager i believe is delivering food, I said okay that's good their helping. Wrong again, I believe they were his friends and only catered to them. He personally hand delivered their food multiple times and stayed there to chat knowing how busy and short staffed they are. Another thing we saw while waiting, there was a little boy making a mess, standing on top of the backboard of the booth. Mother of the kid didn't say or do anything why should I? Even worst, the manager was watching him do all of that and did nothing but point and laugh because he thought it was funny. At that point I was seriously done with this place. I just wanted my food so I could leave. Finally when we get some of our food. Had to be Atleast 35-45 minutes. Our stupid fries came out, one of the other reasons why we came back because it was delicious. 5 minutes later my dish comes out, few minutes later our kids waffles come out. 5 minutes later my cousins burger comes out. So we are all eating our food and my girlfriend still snacking on the stupid fries waiting for her food. Im almost done with my food and still nothing for her. We asked the waitress what's taking so long for her food. We believe she didn't put that order in.   This visit overall was just horrible, from the moment I got there and left. Very unprofessional everywhere that I looked, especially the management and just the really bad service. The food here at Lo-Lo's is good though but I suggest ordering over the phone or if you decide to eat here. Ask for Keke as your server.",

We waited 20 MINUTES to even be acknowledged and asked if anyone had even taken our drinks yet and finally got to order something to drink. We ordered and the waitresses kept coming around trying to give us orders from other people. It took another 20 minutes to get our correct order. The only person that even made an effort to try to turn our experience around was the manager Nate. He was very apologetic for the wait and offered us a free dessert after our meal. The only other good thing was the food, it was tasty but we didn't even enjoy it because there were seriously 4 other tables around us all complaining about the wait also. The service was terrible and just all over the place.",

It took 20min or more to get anything from the time walked in. No place settings, disappearing server...finally after 90min (no exaggeration), we asked to speak to the mgr and coincidentally he had some of our order with him. After hearing our complaints, he bolt charged us for the app and only the food that he brought out. What food we had was ok at best. Otherwise, this review would have been worse. They seemed overwhelmed and need to hire more staff and work on their training.",

My girlfriend and I walked in very excited to try the food out, but as we walked in the party of 4 in front of us was waiting for 15 minutes to be seated. The restaurant was not busy at the moment and I couldn't understand why they were waiting so long.   When they were finally seated, the host didn't acknowledge we were standing in the lobby area waiting to be seated as well. She walked away from her post and never came back for another 10 minutes.  I'm usually very patient, but after listening to many complaints of the people waiting I asked the waitress at the bar if we could sit at one of the empty booths. To my demise, she said we had to wait to be seated. There were only 5 tables in the bar area being waited on. I didn't understand why we couldn't sit there. So we waited another 5 minutes and the host finally came back.   When she cane back we said it was for a party of 2. As she was about to seat us she forgot she had to bring the uber eats driver his delivery and went to the kitchen to get it.   At this point I was frustrated and we walked out just like the other groups in front of us who did not have as much patience as we did. We didn't even get to try the food.   This was very disappointing and I do hope one day we can try this place out. If this service keeps up I don't think this restaurant will survive.",

We only ordered water to drink and you wanna know how long that took ??? 15 mins. The food came about to 15 mins after that and the food was ok.

I was able to score a table during lunch after my second attempt this past weekend and I'm extremely impressed with the ambiance. Lo-Lo's dining room is very trendy loved the decor.  The food is extremely debatable and after reading tons of reviews I'm confident with my overall three star rating.   WHAT I ORDERED:  KK's Fried Chicken & Waffles *Chicken was phenomenal! The seasoning was perfect and the portion size exceeded my expectations MUST TRY ITEM. The waffles were over powered by cinnamon but decent.  *Catfish Add-On was pretty disappointing considering how well seasoned the chicken was.  *Okra was decent but pretty warm by the time my food arrived.  *The Red Beans?? Yikes!!! By far the worst item ordered. The beans taste like BBQ sauce and chili powder. Definitely needs some improvement.  *Peach Cobbler! I can't believe they served this with massive dough chunks. Terrible!!!!  *Round of applause for my BANANA PUDDING! I looked forward to this dessert and it did not disappoint! If your a fan this is a must order dessert!  I don't think I'd return but it was definitely worth the experience and I sincerely hope the restaurant considers improving some of their menu items.   Thank you Ms. Nykeia for being patient with me and my mother and providing exceptional service during such a busy time.",

Chicken and waffles were exceptional and the shrimp and grits was massive.  Had not eaten at all and could not finish it.    Will try perhaps another time, but be aware there might be a wait.",

I would give them a zero if I could I will never go back there and I will strongly urge anyone I know to never go there I don't care how good the food could be or could have been.....I have heard it is amazing.....sadly I will never get to experience their food as I will never be back.  UPDATE We went to another establishment to eat as we are being seated I mentioned the reason we were there was because we were turned away, apparently of the owner of Lolo's was sitting there and heard me after we finished our meal he approached us introduce himself was very apologetic. Ask for another chance invited us back for a meal on him which I was extremely pleased with... Standby for tomorrow evening for a full and honest review and revision of how many stars they will get. So nice to see business men care about their business and customers.  2ND UPDATE  Arrived approximately 9 p.m. greeted by the hostess and seated. Ordered the combo appetizer of fried green tomatoes, fried catfish, and fried green beans. I had the D D chicken and waffles. The food was absolutely amazing the fried green tomatoes were out of this world best I've ever had, the fried green beans where excellent the catfish was amazing. The chicken and waffles was absolutely incredible!  \" every bite was like the first bite all over again\"    Obviously I changed to a five star rating and highly recommend dining there, the staff is incredibly friendly and the service was excellent!",

    "text": "I've been hearing good things about Lolo's food for over a year now, so I was excited to finally get the chance to try it out Sat.evening 3/31..To start, the staff was very friendly and helpful to my girlfriend and i, we got a nice size order, to go ,so when they told us the wait would be 30min It was understandable. We decided to sit at the bar and have a drink while we waited...the Bartender was cool and busted a few jokes but as far as the service, it seemed as if his attention was focused on too many things. .running back and forth to the kitchen and employees asking questions WHILE taking bar orders... I noticed the couple opposite the bar from us looked upset for some reason and left  angrily.. right at that moment I noticed 30min had come and gone, we had been waiting for 54min at this point ( This was not a very busy time of the day),  I continued to remain calm until I started looking for a waitress. .there's not a waitress/server/hostess in site, the only people visible were a bar back and two server/waitresses about to leave for the day (one being our order taker )...I finally say to  the bar back \"I've been waiting for my food for an hour now, can I speak to your manager please? !\" He leaves for 2 min and out walks the bartender who I guess is also the manager?? He explains to me, \"sorry man, we had a Lil meeting out back\"..\"A LIL MEETING!?!IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY? !THE WHOLE STAFF DAMN NEAR? NOW I'M OFFICIALLY PI**ED OFF and I let it be known. The manager said he was going to get my order, he comes back out and asks me \"what did you order again???\" Now I'm SUPER PI**ED, I start to raise hell at this point, embarrassing my girlfriend. The manager goes BACK into the kitchen and comes out in a couple minutes with my order. If not for my girlfriend i would have told them to give me a refund! I grab my food and get the hell out of there. As we were leaving the parking lot we notice a minimum of 6 employees hanging out in the back of the restaurant.. SMH.. We get home and open our to go boxes to soggy pancakes, cold chicken (we live 10 minutes away) Luke warm grits and eggs..most of the food we ordered, being a fan of \"Soul Food\", was just ok..... the greens I give a 7/10,  Mac N Cheese and fish were good... Maybe the food would have been better if it didn't seem like it was sitting, bagged in the kitchen for 30min before we got it.  I was very disappointed in this place, especially with all the good things I heard about it. I suggest Better management and better training of your employees. I will not return nor recommend this restaurant.",

Food coming out incomplete, drinks consistently empty, orders wrong, waiting on necessities to consume my meal. That's just the big stuff. Let's not mention other servers just dropping food on our table & not even asking who it belonged to.  The manager is no where to be found and we waited a good 30 minutes just to pay our bill.. this establishment needs much better management because our server should not have been handling 8 tables by herself without any help from someone higher up. Managers didn't even come out to apologize for anything... I will never frequent this establishment again.",

I ordered a Breast n a Wing with 1 waffle. Also sweet tea and a fruit Punch Kool aid. At first the waffle was very thin but it tasted decent and we also ordered Mac n cheese and it was smallest side dish I've ever gotten at a restaurant. And it was $4. Definitely wasn't worth the sides and i think it was a rip off or they had made a mistake. Two bites and gone, just like that. My wife was very disappointed. But the chicken was on point. Prolly the best chicken I've ever tested at soul food place! Atmosphere n service was ok. Heard servers n hosts were arguing few times and dropping dishes also. I think this place has potential. Very good location and the food was good! Staff definitely needs to be train a lil bit more and plz cmon make the sides a little bigger! Don't give us $1 worth of sides when y'all charging us $4-7 for a side! 3 stars is deserving!",

When it did arrive there wasn't anything spectacular about it to justify the 40 minute wait, it was two of us. The server was very inattentive and when we had questions he just told his boss that we wanted to speak a manager, which we did not! The manager came over and immediately offered us 10% off our bill like we were looking to complain to get free crap. Overall I will not frequent this establishment again and will recommend that my family and friends don't as well. Oh and the yellow tinted sugar water they sell as lemonade is absolutely the most disgusting thing I've ever tried in my life. I attempted to drown out some of the sweetness with water and it was still to suitable to drink.",

    "text": "I had a horrible experience at Lo-Lo's on Rainbow in Las Vegas today, December 4th between 10:30 am and 11:50 am. The food is normally ok and I've never had any issues here prior to this date but this time it was bad.. After placing an order for 3, we waited for our food for an hour. The restaurant did not appear to be busy. At this point, we spoke with a manager. I was told that his name is Doug, however he was not wearing a name tag of any sort. After hearing our complaint, Doug said \"I'm getting it out now\" and he walked away. I waited 7 minutes and I was extremely irritated and had lost my appetite so we told our server that we will pay for our drinks but we were leaving. She told us not to worry about the drinks and that she would cancel the order. On the way out, I asked to speak to the manager again. He walked up with an attitude and I told him that we decided to leave, we waited too long, others that had arrived after us were served before us and that this experience was bad. He replied \"I told you it was in the window and coming out and y'all decided to leave so....\". Our server had checked on us after the first time we had spoken with the manager, so if that was True, how long was our food going to be just sitting in the window? Why wasn't it brought to our table?! I told the manager we still continued to wait and that was unacceptable. He replied \"Well if your server put the ticket in late, she put it in late.\" I responded \"What do you mean? You are the manager!\" He then asked \"Well what you want me to do?!\" I couldn't take his unprofessional attitude anymore so I walked off and he did too. Our server, who witnessed all of this, along with a hostess did apologize as we walked out. This manager is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with! The situation was poorly handled and he has a bad attitude. He clearly does not belong in the customer service field. I wasted almost an hour and a half of my morning here and left pissed off! That visit was most likely my last.",

They were extremely packed so the wait for the food was quite long but our waitress did come over and apologize for the wait.   I ordered 2 drumsticks and a waffle ($7). The waffle was really good (a notch under Roscoe's) I would give it 8.5/10. The chicken was average at best. Maybe it was overcooked but the skin was quite rough. Overall I enjoyed it & will return. It's a good substitute for Roscoe's & will save us from driving to LA! Check them out!",

I got the DD which is one of the waffles with two breasts of fried chicken. The waffle itself was very good with a great hint of cinnamon. The chicken itself wasn't so great. The chicken came out rather dry and hard, almost like the  fried chicken you'd get at a grocery store deli. For the price of 12 dollars that it costs, I recommend you use your money a restaurant you can get a lot more for 12 dollars. For better fried chicken and waffles I'd look towards M&M Soul Food.",

Arrived at 1:00 to eat lunch on our way to drop daughter off at airport.  We had an hour so we thought plenty of time.  We got seated at 1:05.  We waited and waited and waited.  Lo-Lo's was about 1/3 full...so not too crowed and there seemed to be plenty of staff walking around.  No less than 3 different waitress passed by our table with none making eye contact.  OK 15 minutes and I waived one down.  She said I'm not your server, but will let them know.  I went and told the manager...ok...3 minutes later a server came by and said \"I'm not your server, but will take your drink order.\"  OK....We waited...waived down the same server and we said we are ready to order.  She took our order....and we waited and waited...you get the idea.  OK 45 minutes after arriving I waived down a server for a refill and asked for the manager.  He brought our food...I explained this is ridiculous he apologized and gave one meal free.  Now for the kicker.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and was brought a catfish sandwich.  My daughter ordered COOL BRE BRE'S CHICKEN SALAD, but when it was delivered it had no candied walnuts, no cherry tomatoes, no avocado, or no applewood bacon.  All of which is in the picture and the description.",

We arrived, 30-45 minute wait and there were gobs of tables/booths empty.  Got seated at a table, but had ask for a booth and were told about another 20 min wait...ugh, we stayed at the table, but the chairs they have are solid metal seats and hard as a rock..(consider changing), so requested a booth, they told us since we had already placed our order they couldn't move us.....WHAT....was act of congress, requested Manager, finally got moved to a booth and we waited about an hour & 20 minutes for our food, saw tables get up and leave because they hadn't been served.  Our meal was all messed up, didn't get certain items.....I said ok....Give me the manager.  Dawn came to our table and we both just let her have it and she did apologize profusely and comped our meal   She expressed that it was her 3rd day as the new manager and that they are looking for all positions in the restaurant.....LAS VEGAS, if you need a job and you work in the food industry, they are hiring.  Not sure we will return, but do hope they get it together.",

Sat at the bar with out the intention of ordering adult beverages but they announced before we ordered that they had not received there liquor license yet. The food took a bit of time to come out and had to send back because it was missing items that the menus said came on my sandwich. Once it was fixed the food took two bites and it turned into something awesome. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the fact we sat by the POS and the waitresses kept talking bad about other co workers loud enough for us to hear during our entire stay. More than 5 times would they meet up and do this. Not having any regards for us customers whom were right next to them. With out the gossip talk it's a great place and would come back just now I know where not to sit.",

The waitress barely checked on us for refills or to see if we needed anything.  However, when we were almost done eating... she kept coming back every couple of minutes to grab each single plate as it was clear ... All of a sudden all the attention we need from our server, but I knew it was only because we were finishing up and they just needed a table.     Food.   Just come for the chicken !!!  The only thing my family and I really enjoyed was the chicken.  Super crispy and just the right amount of batter.   The waffles were ok, (I don't think anything can compare to Roscoe's chicken and waffles let's be honest).  Mac and cheese was ok and the cornbread was a little too dry for me.   Also, DO NOT get the red velvet pancakes, they were super dry and not worth it.   TIP:  Be prepared to wait.  Since they just opened it is super busy.  Especially on the weekends, over 45 minute wait.    This location is not on my side of town, but I would come back definitely for the chicken and I would come probably on a weekday for now.  Perhaps after some time, the service would improve too!",

A $13 stack of pineapple upside down pancakes was advertised as having fresh pineapple on top, but was served plain with several chunks of canned pineapple griddled into the batter. I enjoyed the sweet flavor of this indulgent dessert-for-breakfast, but truth in menu matters.  The child's size serving of mac and cheese was a large bowl for $5 that no one wanted to finish due to its tangy flavor and gooey texture. A few small grey pieces and specks gave away the secret ingredient: cream of mushroom soup... from a can. This is a staple of my mom's signature casserole, Chicken DiVan, but I don't like it in my macaroni.  I sampled the waffle and grits served with my husband's fried chicken, but the grits were unseasoned and covered in butter (or margarine, more likely) and the waffle tasted like cinnamon. It wasn't a bad breakfast and our friendly waitress (Leigh is the name on my receipt) did a great job, but these recipes just aren't for me. I feel like soul food should not be about shortcuts. Las Vegas already has plenty of good local breakfast eateries, and I'll happily drive a few more miles east on Lake Mead Blvd for my gritz fix in the future.",

Yelper Suzy H planning on checking it out asked if wanted to tag along. Always down for trying the newest food spots in Vegas plus eating with someone else always makes the meal more enjoyable. Yelp style not just one dish but multiple dishes share family style. We ordered few things for lunch.   We started with some Spicy Corn Fritters. I was pleasantly surprise. I thinking just be more normal jalapeno popper deep fry no big deal. They had so much more depth with the corn batter and just right amount of heat from the diced jalapenos. Fried nice golden brown. Moist. Not sure the sauce came with but honestly spicy corn fritters addicting by itself. I tried the sauce nothing memorable the once had one really addicting not stop.   The Three piece chicken and waffles. Really average at best. The thing that never worked for me was the the breading dipped the chicken in. The chicken on the inside was cooked perfectly through nice and moist. The portion size of the chicken is awesome. Just fried chicken is only AS goos as the breading. It just never did anything for me compare to other fried chicken spots around Vegas. I felt like heavy breading or not light breading. Bite into it not  as crispy. The waffles talk about dense. Waffles were so dense nothing fluffy about them. Me that turn off. They cooked nice golden brown on the outside.   The side of cornbread was ok. The size was huge. No way getting cheated on side of cornbread that for sure.   The pineapple upside down pancake. By far was the best part of lunch. The combination is something unique. I loved it. The pancakes was nice fluffy just the way like my pancakes or waffles. The flavor was insane. It really tasted with dessert just in pancake form. There was ample amount of pineapples on top and in the batter. Not over the top that all you taste. Best way describe it really kick ass pineapple upside down cake just in another form. No need for syrup. The pancake has that much flavor. Oreo and Red Velvet that soooo on radar next visit.   The service was without doubt FIVE star. We came on soft opening or should say second day open to the public. The full menu still not gone into effect. Our server forget her name was awesome. We even asked moved different table cause ordered  lot of food for two. Never makes for good pictures with natural light all up in your pics. LOL. Not only our server every came contact with walks past was friendly, attentive, looking feedback on the food, and great service. The decor like the whole chicken all over the place from statues or artwork. It gives Lo-Lo personality.",

Finally someone came out and we were able to get inside. Waited for about 5 minutes to be acknowledged(was told they were understaffed.. seems to be the going theme) then another 5 minutes just to be seated. Once seated.. we did just that SIT!!!! 20 minutes since arriving someone came and took and drink order as well as food order.    Once our order came... everything in my end was ok. I got the \"KK\": 3 pieces of chicken with waffles grits and eggs. I also ordered a side of home fries and catfish.  My waffle was ok, nothing special once was a really crispy around the edges but ok. The chicken was alright and the fish lacked flavor. Overall nothing special food wise with horrible waiting time... our waitress was nice and trying to juggle a lot of not all the tables until helped arrived.",

    "text": "This place has only been open for a few days but they will have their grand opening in less than a week. Their soft-opening menu has less items than their actual menu but all you need in your life are chicken and waffles. There was a wait when we went - everyone seems to be excited about this place! Which makes perfect sense because a lot of people appreciate chicken and waffles without having to go to California for Roscoe's or pay lots for the same dish on The Strip.  If Roscoe's and Famous Dave's had a love child , it would be Lolo's. And just like any new business, there are kinks to be fixed but it's alright - no biggie! Erika was our server and she's fantastic! She was very friendly and she made sure we got our food hot and fast.  Spicy Corn Fritters: Hot bite-size pieces of mildly spicy sweet corn that have been breaded and fried. Crunchy, sweet with a spicy love tap. They come with a dipping sauce that tastes like a combination of mustard and ranch. 4/5  They have chicken combinations galore. Chicken and waffles. Chicken, waffles and grits. Chicken with gravy. Chicken wings.  The KK's: 3 pieces of Southern-style fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits and eggs. You get a lot of food for $15. I was only able to eat half and took the rest to-go. And I'm not one who taps out easily but I didn't wear my extra stretchy pants. The chicken was not dry and the skin was crispy. The waffles have a hint of cinnamon and are the softer kind - it's all about texture and flavor contrast. You don't want everything to be crispy and savory! The scrambled eggs have onions and cheese - pretty tasty. The grits weren't clumpy but had good texture and lots of butter 4/5  They have sweet tea, and Kool-Aid (oh, yeah!). For dessert, they have red velvet cake, and banana pudding. Since I already had a food baby, I didn't get dessert. Everyone enjoyed their meal and we all ended up with to-go boxes.",

    "text": "The wait for this restaurant to open has been insane! Thankfully for IG, I am up to date on everything. This is where the old Tony Roma's used to be, in case you missed the bright yellow Lo-Lo's sign!  Upon entering you are greeted by the amazing group of hosts, they ask if you've been to Lo-Lo's before and are super welcoming. The decor here is amazing, brick and cool gray flooring. The middle you have a bar with huge tvs, and there is outside seating available.   Tonight is the soft opening,  so the menu isn't as huge, but they will start serving full menu 1/29 Friday. Only the best items were chosen :) we opted for the #7 toy toy, 2 wings and a waffle. I got the chicken dinner,  three pieces with 2 sides and and corn bread... figured I'd eat off Santiago's waffle! Lol.   The chicken: The chicken is amazing! Its soooooo succulent and fresh! The breading is insane, perfect, not overly greasy and perfect! Did I mention, perfect? The chicken portions are large! I ordered the dinner and was able to take half of it home. The sides I got were the mac and cheese, and red beans and rice. Mac and cheese was yummy, and to begin with I'm not a red beans and rice fan, but they were good. The corn bread is seriously the best I've tasted! It has actual corn in it and the crust is insane! DELICIOUS!  THE WAFFLES! THE BIG WINNER HERE! They are OUTSTANDING! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! Like pillows of heaven in your mouth!  The servers here are definitely ready to work and make sure you're fully taken care of, our server was super great and actually spoke to us and cracked a joke! Rory and Semaj are seriously great!!  GET SOME!!  YAY!",

    "text": "Warning: DO NOT make the same mistake I did! A huge mistake we did was coming to this place on a Sunday afternoon so close to the opening of this place. It also seemed like, from the way all the patrons were dressed, that most might have been coming from Sunday mass/church, so lots of families and large parties were waiting.  We had an estimated wait of 45 minutes for our party of 5 when we arrived around 11:45AM but actually ended up waiting about an hour to be seated. After that, it took about 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Overall, service was very slow. It was understandable given how PACKED this place was. People were surrounding the restaurant waiting for the table, and you had to be present to hear your name being called over the mic.   If you can avoid it, I would certainly advise against dining here on a Sunday afternoon.  After we were seated, Leigh, our server, greeted us and gave us our menus.   Service 3.5/5  I really have to hand it to her... that place seemed chaotic but she was doing a fine job in refilling my friend's coffee and giving us updates when our food was being prepared. I can't really accurately rate the service due to high volume activity, but I did feel like Leigh was trying her best.  Food 4/5 We ordered drinks first. They had kool-aid on tap (offered in grape, blue, and fruit punch). I chose the fruit punch but it was waaaayyyy too sweet so I had to really water it down to drink it comfortably. My friend ordered a lemonade and had to water hers down too, so be aware of over sugared drinks (to be expected in a soul food restaurant, I suppose?) Two of my friends ordered an Arnold Palmer with unsweetened iced tea and I really enjoyed it -- probably would be my choice of drink for the next visit.  I ordered the Baby Ray which came with 3 chicken pieces and 2 waffles. The chicken was drenched in gravy with some semi-carmelized onions as a topping. The gravy had what I believe was a hint of bell pepper to taste (I really hate the taste of bell peppers but this was tolerable). I ended up only being able to finish the thigh and wing part of the chicken.   I only finished the thigh and wing part because the breast was not only way too much food for me, but it was also too dry.  Waffles were perfectly made and also quite large. I was able to finish 1 1/2 out of the 2 waffles. All this food was actually way too much and definitely put me in a food coma. Do note that I came here on an empty stomach and waited 1.5 hours to actually eat.  Ambience 5/5 Southern style everything! Mason jar cups, mason jar chandeliers... super super cute! I didn't have too much time to examine the restaurant but it was very upbeat and busy. Despite the amount of people in the restaurant and the noise level, I was able to hold conversations with my table which is great. I've been to restaurants that were just as packed but I wouldn't be able to hear the person next to me.  I also saw that they had an outside area, covered of course, which I would love to try when it gets a little warmer out.  I had a pleasant experience with the food and would love to give this place a try at a less busier time!",

    "text": "I came earlier in the week for chicken and waffles with the hubby and then decided I had to come back for dinner to try the chicken fried steak. I saw how angry some yelpers were because of the wait on the weekend, so we went during the weekday, and we were seated right away both visits.   I would definitely recommend the chicken and waffles. This is their specialty and for good reason. They know what they are doing with fried chicken. The waffles have way to much cinnamon for my taste, but a quality dish never the less. I saw the biscuits and gravy they were serving, that looked amazing,  and thought that the chicken fried steak dinner would have the same type of white gravy. So we made plans to come for dinner just a couple of days later.  The chicken fried steak was not my favorite........ I got the whipped potatoes and red beans and rice as my sides. The chicken fried steak was a quality product in and of itself. It was tender and the breading was good, but I really didn't care for the gravy at all. It was a brown gravy and not very savory and flavorful at all. I really didn't care for the sides either. The potatoes were very strange, not at all like mashed potatoes that I was hoping for.  My husband had the DVZ's Hot Ghetto Mess for dinner. It is 6 wings with Chicago Style Sauce served over white bread, and a he added a side of mac and cheese. I did taste my husband's mac and cheese, and it was good. It has a little kick to it with the added black pepper they use.  My husband liked the wings, and was glad he ordered the sauce on the side.   I really recommend the chicken and waffles, and probably sticking with the breakfast items. Those were our favorites and it is more their specialty.",

The best service, the best atmosphere, the best giant cup of coffee! And then...The VERY best fried chicken I have ever had since my Mother made it when I was a child. We had their famous Chicken and Waffles! Cooked to most perfect crisp and so tender! Absolutely the most delicious! Ordered a side of grits with butter and cheese. Wow! Prices are great!

We went by a dozen times checking on their progress and finally they opened.   My husband and I are early risers and so on the weekends we are always up and ready to go, today was no exception, our plan, to get a table at Lo-Lo's before the crowd shows up.  Quite surprised that at 830 on Saturday morning the place is nearly empty. We are seated right away, we notice lots of empty tables and lots of staff doing various things, and it seemed they where all to busy to notice we had sat down.   Finally, an assistant server notice me making faces at him to get attention so someone could take our order. He got us drinks.   After several more minutes a server noticed we where in her section and took our order, two number ones. Thats eggs, any way, grits, two waffles and three pieces of chicken, white or dark meat, I got mixed.   Another long wait for the food, in the mean time the place got really busy. Tables of five to eight showing up all at the same time.   Food finally arrived! The chicken was really crispy and golden brown, the crust stuck to the meat so I could get skin and juicey meat in one bite. The eggs, scrambled with cheese and onions, the grits with a big spoon of butter melting on top, and of course two golden brown waffles also with a spoon of butter melting and running all over. The syrup, warmed was delicious.   Overall, food was great, there seemed to be a lot of staff but unorganized and lacking leadership, perhaps a sign of newness?   We are eager to return and try the chicken fried steak!",

I know it's not a big deal but it's a personal preference probably because I was 1st introduced to \"Chicken and Waffles\" at Roscoe' s in LA, so when I get a filleted chicken  breast that's been battered and fried, I tend to pout.  I also like that there are various combinations wof the same meal on the menu, no need to ask if they can add a this or substitute a that, it saves time when ordering which is a very important thing when you're hungry.  I was so hungry I forgot to check in that's why in my check in photo the waffle is half way gone, don't judge me. Oh, and I gave it five stars because the service was great the lady who sat me was a dear, Nathan my server stoped by twice to check up on me and so did some other guy plus the bathroom  was clean. Very pleased....... and full, oof",

I think what made us most irritable was that in addition to the slow service, there was a huge lack of communication in letting us know whatever was hindering our food from coming out. We did speak with the manager, who was super nice...so that and the food flavor/quality is why I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 1.   We came in after what appeared to be a lunch rush, but the place was not extraordinarily packed when we sat down. My party of 4 was eventually greeted and our drink orders were taken. It took a little long to get our drinks, but nothing crazy... nothing like what we were about to experience.   After putting in our order we watched as multiple tables came in and sat down and got their food around us, yet we were still food-less. These were parties of various sizes as well and who appeared to have ordered the same types of things we ordered. Matter of fact, one of the orders within my party was a med cooked burger! We continued to watch as everyone got their food and had made eye contact with our server a couple times, hoping to get her to come tell us why our food was taking so long. She never did. We actually ended up speaking with a manager about the issue and it wasn't until then that we actually got our food. When our food was being brought to our table though, we noticed that the burger was missing. What in the world?! Also, my chicken was COLD! After waiting over 45minutes for food and it was cold? Nope.   The manager had offered up a discount but, we explained, that was not what we were after. We would have been somewhat okay (I'm still upset at my 45minute COLD chicken) had the server communicated properly and treated us how those around us were being treated. It is still unclear to me why our server did not take care of us the same way that the other tables were being taken care of... and here's the kicker... she sent over another server to drop the check!   The worst part was that I'm not even sure if the food was good enough for me to return.",

Thank you Tenisha for all your kindness.",

    "text": "Finally went over to try this place. One and done for me. The resteraunt was pretty busy on a saturday afternoon. It was very clean and nicer than I expected.  The staff was very freindly and offered great service. The food came out quickly, was warm and the order ws correct.   The one problem, its not that great. The chicken is really average and the waffles are just waffles.  Large portions is a always bonus but at these prices they should be large.  My wife and I each got an entree and i had a sweet tea, the bill was $32.00. That is a lot of money for some average tasting food.   The chicken skin was battered using heavy flour to the point that you could taste and feel the flour. It wasent for me.",

We were not impressed with anything... the chicken and fish were fried in old vegetable oil, the mac and cheese was over cooked and most disappointing --- the red beans and rice were a combination of ranch style beans and rice. Really!! We live in Texas where we visited the new location in Southlake. Yep, messed up there too, but the Phoenix location rocks. I hope the other stores catch up soon. Unfortunately, I won't be back to see anytime soon.",

    "text": "Got to the restaurant at 8pm on a Saturday night. 4 tables were occupied and the rest were open. We were the 5th table. Here is a time line of our visit...  8:18 the host took our drink order and food order. The girl who we would learn at the end was our server, pointed to us and told him to take our order. I don't think she likes us. She doesn't make eye contact. We did just come from watching a baseball game so maybe it's because we are dirty or smell? Can't tell.  8:27 we get our drinks.   8:33 we are told by the host that they are out of the Malaysia burger. So we order a chicken tender basket. Still no sign or word from our server.  8:43 the manager, Nate, refilled my drink and my sons. He also told us that they are out of the Malaysia burger.  We were tempted to mess with him and act completely shocked but decided that we didn't want to confuse them all more since this was becoming a train wreck. We told him that we changed it to the tender basket. We informed him we haven't met our server yet. He goes back the kitchen and starts yelling a woman's name.   8:45 the other server (who's name we learn is Kiki) brings out two boys get their tender baskets. Food looks amazing. For real. As the boys are eating and Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" comes on. While this type of music is what helped with the boys coming into the world, not the best song choices for a 3, 10, 11 year old.   8:52 Kiki comes over and asks what my wife and youngest ordered. Wife contemplates whether she should risk telling them what she ordered, tell them to forget it, or start messing with them. At this point we want to get out of there. Since we will never come back, she decides to try it since we are there.  We tell her to forget the order for the youngest. He was oblivious and wouldn't have liked the mac and cheese. He's picky.   9:00 Kiki brings my wife her food. Looks like they put a frozen breakfast meal on a plate. The waffle looks like a crepe and the eggs look like a tube of yellow sponge. She wasn't happy with it and it didn't look that good. Our server still hasn't been to the table. She has been to the 3 other tables in our area to get their drinks and food and bring bills but not us. I'm beginning to get a complex and think it's because I stink, I'm ugly, or I some how offended her in another life and she remembers. Regardless, she sucks.   9:10 my wife is done, we are all done. Since our server is now deliberately doing everything possible to ignore us and isn't hiding the fact we have somehow offended her to the point that she is refusing any and all interaction, my wife goes and gets containers from the counter where the registers are since we apparently have the plague and can't get help.   9:13 kiki walks by so I ask the name of our server.  She tells me it's Mimi. We inform Kiki that we haven't met Mimi at all. Kiki acts appalled but she has to know that Mimi sucks and doesn't want to admit it. Kiki tries to mitigate Mimi's total suckage by saying it's because she is new.  I'm not buying it. I thought Kiki was cool but now I think that Mimi has roped her into her little devious mindgame that Mimi is in the end stage of executing but I'm on to her. Kiki goes to tell Mimi the jig is up and we want our bill.   9:15 Mimi makes her grand appearance. When my wife informs Mimi that everyone else did her job and we didn't see her at all. Mimi confidently replies that its \"because I didn't get a chance to come over.\"  She says it with gusto and without the slightest hint of apology or acknowledgement of her awfulness. She never apologizes and appears oblivious to the fact that she didn't do her job and openly admitted it like it was no big deal. She hands us our bill with a smile like her boo boo don't stink and asks if everything is right. That takes some gumption man. You are our server and the fact you don't know our order and have to ask us to verify its veracity is the pinnacle of trash. And the kicker of it all is that they still had that dang Malaysia burger on it as well as the mac and cheese we order for our youngest but canceled. They also had the tender basket we ordered as a replacement for the Malaysia burger. My wife pointed it out and she went to fix it. We learned that Mimi is actually named Mishiawna. I've been deceived again. This place lures you in and disappoints you like a blind date that has a good personality. So Mimi brings the \"corrected bill\" and while the mac and cheese was taken off, the stupid Malaysia burger was still on the bill. So we point it out again and she goes and fixes it, again. So we get the bill for a third time and its finally right. Mimi tries to hang around like we are old friends, i'm sure to see the giant tip she is expecting, and I look at her like she just kicked my dog and flicked a booger at me. She then scurries away to the hole she was hiding in all night. I promptly sign the receipt and we leave, never to return.",

    "text": "One of the worst eating establishments I've been to in awhile. Saw the sign on the way to Applebee's, read the yelp reviews and decided why not. Upon arrival we were seated quickly but being greeted for drinks took 15 mins and having our order taken took another 15 on top of that. After the initial 30 mins another lady stopped by our table to explain that there was only 2 waiters working which was why the delay. As if the 30 mins wasn't enough, the even longer wait for the food was even worse.   Upon getting our food the chicken was old, stale, over cooked, and plain dry. The waffles were dry and seemed as if they we had been sitting under a heating lamp somewhere. The macaroni and cheese was.... Different to say the least. The only good thing was the drinks. Well, most of them anyway. The lemonade was a no go from the start. The sweet tea was good the first glass but the second glass tasted like they switched the batch with over brewed, unsweetened tea. The kool-aid was probably the best thing there but definitely reminiscent of the kool-aid that you made back in the hood... Super sweet. They brought out some complimentary corn bread for the long wait that was pretty much on par with the rest of the meal. Overall, not a good dining experience.   When we asked to speak with the manager we had an additional 20 min wait before my husband went looking for her himself. He was then advised by the manager of how he was the 3rd person to complain about the food in the past hour. The manager went to look at the food and advised she could understand our disappointed because it looked as if we were served all old food and decided to comp us the whole meal. She apologized for the inconvenience and hoped that the experience would not dim our view of the restaurant and that we would come back and give them another chance at a later time.",

I should have known better not bother after I called to place the order and they didn't answer the phone. I foolishly decided to drive down to the restaurant planning to place my order in person and wait. After standing at the front for over 10 minutes watching the servers and bartender totally ignore me, I should've left at that point.  A person sitting at the bar, who turned out to be waiting to give one of the employees a ride home, noticed my plight and asked if I was waiting for a table.  When I told her I planned to order take out, she pointed out the manager and helped me flag him down. Instead of taking my order, he rudely told me that I would have to sit at the bar and wait for the bartender to take my take out order.  He added that his kitchen was very behind and I should be prepared for a long wait.  After continuing to be ignored by the bartender for another 5 minutes I gave up. They clearly did not want my business so I walked out. Never again!",

My daughter ordered the Lo-Lo. It was three pieces of fried chicken & two waffles. The waffles were soggy and the chicken was too. No crisp, no seasoning. She had one wing and a few bites of her waffles.  My husband had the Pick 3 for $20. He had the catfish beignets, fried green tomatoes & chicken gizzards. He barely took a bite of each and said they were all disgusting.  When the food was dropped off we asked the server for an extra plate, some sliced onions and I had ordered an extra piece of catfish. We had to ask a bus boy for the extra plate and never saw the onions or the extra piece of fish. Not ONCE did the server come by to ask how the food was, refill our drinks or check on us. We had to wave him down to get our check.   Bad food and bad service!! We won't ever spend another cent at Lo-Lo.",

Went back a couple days after still was busy ask for a table for two was a hour and a half hour wait so we decided to wait and it only took about 20 minutes to b seated. Our waitress came over gave us our so called menu told us there were no adult size cup just kids sizes so she left brought back our drinks we both had kool-aid i order fruit punch and my wife  ordered watermelon  so she brought back us watermelon so i didn't get my fruit punch so and we placed our order my wife ordered the fried tomatoes and the chicken and waffles I ordered the 3 piece chicken that came with 2 sides and cornbread.. Now mind u the fried tomatoes are a appetizer we waited about 15 min for our tomatoes now here's the funny thing we had no utensils to eat them with so our tomatoes were getting cold  so we  flagged down our waitress and ours looked at us like they didn't have any so she left to get get us some and we never saw her again once again we flagged down another waitress and asked for utensils and it was the same look so our food finally came and we still didn't have anything so the waitress got our forks but no knives  nor spoons came with them now mind u we ordered an appetizer while back and when we finally got our utensils our appetizer was cold. So what I didn't understand they had like six waitresses and waiters sitting in the back against the wall that could have checked on all the other customers to see if they needed anything but I guess that's what happens  so we started eat our food and everything was delicious until I found a hair in my mac and cheese  it ruined our appetite and my wife a i was very furious we brought the waitress to bring it to her attention she asked us if we wanted another mac and cheese or if we wanted it off our check when she couldn't take it off my  check because it was part of the meal like the cornbread i never got I guess  when you just open a new restaurant  you have a lot to learn n a few months but at least know the  BASICS   I hope they get their act together with a menu  with more things and a better well trained staff so we'll wait about a month to see if anything improved and well will go back to try Lolo's again.",

The hostess (older lady) refused to seat us in a booth, even though several were empty in different sections of the restaurant. My back hurts, so I wanted a booth, but apparently that was too much to ask for. She said she couldn't seat us in a booth because they were all dirty (they weren't). She was on a power trip. So we left and went across the street to Famous Dave's, where their hostess was happy to seat us- imagine that!",

Our waitress was quick and on point we ordered Lo Lo's chicken and waffle meal and the phat. Azz Samich the names are amusing at least. The sweet tea was insanely sweet . The fried chicken was burnt from old oil used the waffles were ok. My phat Azz Samich came out as fish when I ordered chicken. Wasn't anything special no good flavor or anything the fries were cold. I ordered banana pudding to go and let's just say it tasted like gross fake banana pudding from a store bought can wasn't impressed at all. Surely didn't look like the online menu I seen. A bill of $70.00 bucks including a tip surely wasn't worth it for the flavor less food. But we can now say we came and ate there, and don't need to go back. Oh and it says they have bread pudding on the online menu but apparently it doesn't exist here.",

    "text": "First of all let me start off by saying when this place first opened it was the best chicken and waffle place in Las Vegas. Me and my family haven't been there in year prior to our recent visit yesterday. We got there at 10am Saturday had to wait over 30 mins to be seated due only two waitress working. While we were waiting their it a  was influx of people walking in on a Saturday morning. Everyone  was asking why is their only two waitress working right now on a weekend?  Also the host kept asking everyone were they over 21 so that people can be placed at  bar . We finally got seated outside and or waitress took 20 mins before she even got to us and keep in mind their was only three of seating outside. Finally order our food and the waitress didn't even check up on us we had to grab our own napkins and salt and pepper ( as well as hot sauce) she had no personality barely even talked to us. I had to get her attention to send my chicken back because it had hair on it still. Once she picked up our plates she didn't even say anything if we needed a to go box or was the food good. NOTHING! So I just sat there and waited on my phone until she asked me did I need a to go box after the second time she can back to get our checks. The food was ok waffles were soggy very disappointed. We eat out around the world so we are very knowledgeable about great customer service. Debra who wasn't even our waitress came around and asked if we were ok and told us to come back and ask for her. She most be the only great waitress there. ask for Debra!",

    "text": "The service was slow, which is understandable because the place is new.  There is no call in or take out so the line is inevitable.  After waiting to be seated our food took at least an hour and then was missing things.  They did not have everything on the menu and kept having to substitute because for example mash potatoes weren't done or there was no more French fries.  Then there was no banana pudding or red velvet cake left either and it was 3pm.  The chicken was very good and cooked just right as well as mainly of the other dishes.  Most of the problems are easily fixed and maybe after the place is own a little longer they will make sure they keep the sides on deck and always have the desserts.  I liked the kool aide but my family thought it was too sweet.  Over all I would come back, but I hope the staff can do a quicker job at taking orders and seating people and the owners keep stuff in stock.",

Mac n cheese: creamy and cheddary. Definitely could have had several servings.  Yams: very sweet and pretty good. I have never liked yams from a restaurant before(mine are always better and they are usually canned in restaurants). But these were surprisingly good!  Waffles: meh, a little soggy but very flavorful. Im not the biggest waffle fan anyways.  The chicken: ON POINT!!! Omg there are no words!!!! This was perfectly golden, flavorful fried chicken! The breast wasnt dry and the meat was so tasty, down to the bone.  Btw they have several kool-aid flavors and the watermelon tastes just like watermelon jolly ranchers! Yummy!!! Service: wonderful! For being so busy everyone was helpful and everything was well done for an opening. \"Rory\" our waiter was AMAZING! Funny, knowledgeable about the food, and full of personality. Loved the music they played too. Stevie Wonder, Blackstreet, Lauryn Hill. What an experience! Also, I gotta say, I appreciated the diversity of people working here. Older, younger, all races and styles. Very pleasant experience, we will be going back again and again!!!",

    "text": "Being from LA, it's heart breaking not having a Roscoe's in Vegas. However, when I saw chicken & waffles, I knew I had to give this place a shot. Sunday afternoon seems pretty hectic. 25 min wait for 2 people, but my boyfriend and I found a place at the bar so we got to skip the wait. The bartenders were really friendly; pretty good service. Now food wise.. Here is where I compare the two. I ordered the #9: breast, leg and waffle. Also got a side of Mac &cheese. The chicken was crispy which I enjoyed, but a little on the salty side, in my opinion. The waffle was almost IDENTICAL to Roscoe's. It might have had cinnamon in it or something different, but overall it gave me the same satisfaction of a Roscoe's waffle. Yum! Mac & cheese was just okay. Definitely not Roscoe's, but it was decent. Their sweet tea is super yummy! On the sweeter side, but absolutely delicious! So this wasn't 'Scoes from back home, but it's the closest thing to it. I'll definitely be coming back next time I'm in the mood for some chicken and waffles!",

    "text": "I usually don't write a review but i had to. So i came in today as a birthday lunch w my family. We arrived and were greeted by an older lady in the front. We were a party of 5, 2 being infant/toddler, 2 adults and 1 child. We were sat in the middle of the room, given 2 high chairs on a table that sits 4. We noticed a lot of bigger parties around. We waited a good almost 30-40  minutes after we sat down, not even a drink order was taken. There was a couple behind us, who when we arrived had just gotten their food, ate, got their table cleaned and another couple was placing their order.  I literally had to call over another server to our table who was in our \"area\" to ask her if she knew who our server was. She said she did not but would take our orders anyway. While she took our drink order, the couple behind us got their food. We waited another 25 minutes for our food. And no one else even came to our area as \"our server\" another couple i noticed behind us on the other end got their drinks but they never got to place an order and they left. Their table was cleaned off without hesitation or question. We didn't get refills, and the server came around 3x once to drop off our drinks, another to say our food was almost ready and another to drop off our food. My daughter was getting hangry so i had to request for her food to come out first. It did and ours came out 10 minutes later. We all ate and our food was warm at best. The drinks (we all got different.kool-aid flavors) were delicious and in huge mason jars. I got the DD the chicken was moist and tender; thr waffle was decent, my 10 year old got soggy old looking bacon and red velvet pancakes (which were ok), my husband got hot link sandwhich (it tasted similar to a hot dog, the bbq sauce was good but the link was eh. My young daughter got mac n cheese and i can't put my finger on it but it was lacking something. We also got chili cheese fries and the cheese was under the chili and not melted. Overall we paid $70 for our meal. Would i go again?? maybe, but not w my family, i will call in my order and pick it up. Cuz the table service was not a good experience.",

However, the service is by far the WORST service I have ever experienced. Our server explained to us, while he was taking our order, that it's better if we pay him tip in cash. Then we received our food before we got our drinks. When I asked him about our drinks he stood there and had to ask us what we wanted again. I had originally ordered a beer but never got that. When he brought our drinks he didn't give us any straws. He never came back to check on us. The table next to us had to flag him down for the check after sitting there waiting for more than 15 minutes. I paid with a $100 bill and when he brought me my change he shorted me 75 cents. Service like that makes us not want to go back. I have heard from several people that they have had the same horrible service. Step it up Lo Lo's. You won't last long in this town if you don't.",

    "text": "The food at Lolo's was good, and if reviews and visits were based on food alone I would definitely return. But my rating on this location in particular is not based on the quality of their food. This was my family's first visit and we were very excited to try this new restaurant. We became very frustrated with this visit. We arrived with a group of 8 there was no one waiting to be seated, the hostess told us that there would be a 15 minute wait worst case scenario 30 minute wait. The adults decided to order drinks at the bar, the lone bartender attending an empty bar took 15 minutes to procure 4 drinks. We then notice that not only this employee was working the bar but serving tables as well! After 20 minutes of waiting the hostess advised the wait would only be 5 minutes longer. After an additional 10 minutes another hostess taps a guest in my party on the back of her arm let's her know that there's only 5 more minutes to wait. After another 10 minutes the hostesses advise us that the reason why we aren't seated is because an existing party \"won't leave and are just talking\". Blaming patrons for new guests not being seated is unprofessional. Our total wait was 45 min to be seated 12 minutes for sodas and another 30 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. The restaurant in itself did not lack in employees but the organization of duties seemed to be lacking.",

First off they don't have their liquor license yet. I'm okay with that. My husband ordered the KK and I ordered a burger (well done). When we got our food the first thing I notice was my fries were cold. My husband's waffles and chicken were cold too. We didn't want to complain so we just started to eat. Well I always cut my burger when I ask for well done and it wasn't well done. I also asked for no tomatoes but it was on there. I asked if she could have them redo my burger...20 minutes later no burger..my husband was done with his food and I was just over it. They need more servers. They have A LOT of bus people but need more servers. The manager was called out three times before we left. We spoke with the manager and he stated he would take off the burger and bring our ticket. 15  minutes later no ticket. Our waitress comes and tells us that he just said everything was on the house because of the burger. That would have been good to know like 10 minutes ago. All in all I am going to give this place 3 more months to get the kinks out before I go back.",

This is my 3 rd time coming here and it's the same every time! If it wasn't for the great kitchen staff cooking good food I would never come here! Cause the FOH staff needs an absolute face lift! Food I rate a 5 star if I could but the service is horrible! A server finally greeted but only to tell me he would be right with me but then never returned! So after 25 minutes of no service I walked out! As I'm leaving 4 staff members notice me leaving but no one made an effort to say anything! I'm a restaurant manager myself so I know the struggles of short staff and being busy but this was note the case on 7/8/17 @1245p.m. Thank your kitchen staff for saving this place I'll be back just for the food and give another try maybe the service will be better or if we get any!",

I have never had southern fried chicken soooooo delicious and juicy as theirs.  Decor is very relaxing, like I'm at a barn. There is always a wait every time we go there. I have to warn people though, they will not seat you unless everyone at your party is present.  There were six of us that met there and one of the ladies was parking her car., we informed the hostess that she was parking and she will just join us at our seat but she said that they will not seat us unless we were all together. Aside from that issue, everything went well.  The prices were very reasonable.  They serve Kool-Aid which I haven't had for years.  I ordered the Betty Boop meal. (yes, the menu consisted of the Nay-Nay, Lo-lo, etc.) If you are looking for comfort food, this place is a definite place to go.",

I went with my mom and my kiddos for lunch. It took what seemed like forever to get anyone to acknowledge us, and they got our drink order, and we were told them we were ready, and they said they would get our server (who never came to our table at all, she was running around like it was busy, but it was not.) Our server ended up being a wonderful man named Andrew and he was so friendly and very attentive, made us feel like family, if I do go back I would request him, he took good care of us. When we did get our food, the portions were a good size, but the one thing I was so excited about turned out to not be amazing. I got the chicken finger platter with fries and a waffle, while my waffle was delicious, my chicken was a mixed bag. The meat was good, nice and moist, not dry at all, but the breading was boring. No seasoning at all. I love fried chicken, it is one of my favorite meals to eat, but if you don't have good breading then it is just pointless to me. If there was any seasoning, I could not taste it at all, but besides that my fries were okay, nothing to remember. At least my drink came in a big mason jar and was their home made lemonade which was very good on this hot summer day. My mom loved her French toast platter, and my daughter got a waffle breakfast sand which, which she seemed to like, and my server was very good. Technically it was a decent outing, but if your signature dish is a classic like fried chicken, you better have some amazing chicken, especially since there are so many choices here in vegas. The chicken meat was good, but the breading was terrible, and I know this sounds lame, but it's not worth it for me to come back. I will just go to churches or popeye's instead.",
