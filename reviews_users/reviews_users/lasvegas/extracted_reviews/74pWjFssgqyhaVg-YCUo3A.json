My personal favorite is the cracked croissant because how can you go wrong with bacon on a croissant? The answer is you can't. Do expect some wait time on a Saturday or Sunday morning though I've never personally waited longer than 20 minutes.",

The service is very friendly and accommodating.  Bonus - they speak Spanish if you want to eat your eggs while hearing a foreign language.  (Our server spoke perfect English.)  We had a large party and they sat us within 20 minutes at the tail need of breakfast. Seriously delectable oatmeal.   Eggs and bacon were near if not perfect.  And the omelets, eggs Benedict, and sweet rolls were amazing.  I'm really glad I was able to try a bite of everything.  That oatmeal plate they have was huge - filled with fruit and granola.  But the rest was so good I couldn't help but try.  Nice job y'all! We'll be back with out appetites.",

I got the fruit side with my eggs and it was a nice change with grapefruit, watermelon and honeydew rather than your typical fruit mix.  It was all nice and fresh too. Per their recommendation we shared a piece of the crumb cake.  Wasn't your typical crumb cake, more like a light fluffy piece of cake with some cream cheese bottom and icing on top but it was well balanced and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. My understanding is the flavors change too, will have to see.  They do have a frequent rewards/point card that they tell me gives you good coupons.  Would definitely go back.",

We've been going to this location of the Cracked Egg sporadically for nearly 10 years now.  I started off always having their solid eggs and turkey sausage plate, but now that my diet is more plant strong these days, this time I opted for the Veggie Skillet - and I'm sooooo glad I did!  Fresh broccoli, mushrooms and spinach sauteed and served over the Cracked Egg's signature seasoned potatoes - topped with two eggs over easy. I requested no cheese - and didn't miss it at all.  So fresh and so good!    One thing I was happy to see was that the wait was much shorter than I remember for a Sunday - about 10 minutes. I have a feeling that's due to more breakfast options opening in the area.   We tried to go to Babycakes but they had an hour and fifteen minute wait!  Bad for fans of Babycakes, good for fans of the Cracked Egg!",

That's unless I get the BLT, which is great as well. The feel of the location is very \"at home having brunch or lunch in your kitchen,\" it's small, usually packed, but the staff is great at getting people in and out in a timely and orderly fashion.

The coffee cake is really great because it's always different and I think it's homemade so always tastes fresh love that.   Okay so why 2 stars? Honestly the service is mediocre at best. Our actual server was very nice and friendly but the rest of the staff was very unprofessional. ***EVERYTIME*** we come in the staff is just sitting around eating and acting like it's their break room...I get it, you were busy and now you're hungry but you should keep some sort of professionalism. You're not closed yet so don't act like you are. \"Shit where are the bussers\" is what one guy said in response to most the booths needing to be bussed. We watched staff eating then handling fresh food without washing their hands. I'm in the industry... That is a basic guideline to not spreading your germs. I'm not looking for 5 star service but just some professionalism. One girl literally was spinning a coin on the counter the entire time and then dropping it on the floor over and over. It was really annoying...   I hope that they can tell the staff to act a little more professional so we don't have to feel like we are interrupting their break everytime we dine there. It ruins the experience and it's happened so many times I had to write something.",

Because I joined their Roaylty Rewards program last year and am such a regular, I get an $8 gift certificate in the mail every month to spend.  Armed with this month's certificate and famished from a long swim workout, my recovery breakfast this morning was the Garden Patch omelet, hash browns, and the coffee cake--oh yeah!  If you order the coffee cake instead of toast, it will be brought to you first, like an appetizer, but I saved it for dessert--yes, you can have dessert at breakfast!  Customer service has always been top-notch and I've never had a bad meal yet.  And, with my certificate, I only had to pay $5 for my meal, including the tip.  Thank you and keep cracking those eggs!",

This restaurant is in North Las Vegas but just a 15 -20 minute ride from the Strip depending which end you coming from.  Great decor and extra clean restaurant. Lately I have found restaurants with many decorations and fixtures do not dust appropriately! The menu is unique which I like a lot!   My husband had the monte cristo with hashbrowns and it met his expectations- and he has a pretty high bar. I had the bacon cheeseburger scramble with egg whites and it was delicious! The coffee cake was some kind of sinful pumpkin flavor and came out warm. Service was excellent- just enough attention but not annoying. Will go back again!

The Cracked Egg is our new \"go to\" place.  If you're there before 8:30, then you have a good chance at no wait but after that, it starts to get busy.  I  have had many things on the menu but my favorite is the pork chili verde omelet.  It's got tender pork, cheese and a green chili sauce over the top and it's full of good flavor.  In addition, I have tried both potato options (hash browns or seasoned potatoes) and the seasoned potatoes are the choice of champions.  Overall, I have always had a good meal here and the wait staff is very nice and attentive, even when it gets busy.  However one thing I don't like is having to take my check up front to pay rather than dealing with it at the table.  Sometimes it's pretty crowded up front and the wait just to pay is the down side while if they took care of it at the table, I get to wait and chit chat with my company instead.",

    "text": "Cracked Egg gets my vote for the most underrated breakfast on the NW side of Vegas. While there is a 30 min wait across the street at Babystacks, we are welcomed on a Sunday morning with the option of dining indoors or out!  The coffee is strong, the service is great, and the food comes out pretty quickly and hot!  I love that there are not so classis breakfast options with peppers and chilies. A huge variety of omelets, and of course some basic eggs and bacon as well.  On my most recent visit, I went with the special on the board which was a fried French toast with berries. Literally, the BEST French toast I ever had! I devoured all 4 thick sliced and was STUFFED!  My daughter got one of the specialty French toasts on the menus, and hers came with 6 slices. Not sure what the difference was, maybe because mine was the special. Either way I am not complaining at all, both were excellent!  I feel like the staff has all been here for a while, and they got it down well! I also love that some of the dishes are names based on the surrounding neighborhoods. (North shore/South shore etc)  The decor, reminds me of someone's grandmothers kitchen. I love the sign that says, \"We have no Wifi, pretend it's 1995 and talk to each other\".  Delicious, home-style cooking in a neighborhood setting, perfect for everyone!",

I got the Country Benny which is biscuits and gravy with poached egg. It was really good but I couldn't finish it. I would have liked a little bit more gravy to compliment the amount of biscuits there is.  My beau got the Carnitas omelette. It was pretty good. Only complaint is that the vegetables (onions, bell pepper) needed to be cut in smaller pieces.   On beautiful days like today you can actually sit outside to eat.",

Ignacio had the eggs benedict and there was as most a couple tablespoons of hollandaise sauce spread across the tops of the two soft poached eggs.  Of course when he asked for more a nice portion arrived. Uriel had a chicken wrap and again while good it lacked a decent amount of goodies inside.  I had the Corned beef Reuben and again lacked a nice amount of meat and even kraut, also the rye was not well toasted. We will  probably try here again for breakfast as the service was great and friendly.",

It was ok, not what I expected...Not much chorizo and the jalapenos were the pickled kind, wasn't expecting pickled jalapeno with eggs, but it wasn't bad.....you get a nice portion of potatoes. The second time I went back I ordered your simple bacon and eggs, I was less impressed the second time around. My food was barely warm.

The hash browns were dry and tasteless.  Even the toast was badly done, one dot of butter in the middle part of burnt & dry toast.  I'll give them credit for the eggs, and that's it.",

Situated at the Flynn Gallagher plaza next to Starbucks, this little gem of a place serves up the best Eggs Benedict ever - I usually get mine with Avocado and Tomato because I'm a bleeding-heart vegetarian, and they are so divine.  I actually sit on the plane ride there and daydream the whole time (and salivate, too) about what I'm going to inhale at this charming little nook.    This client of mine hired other consultants, too, who flew in from various places as Denver and New Jersey and Texas, and we all agreed that we would somehow conspire to conjure up a reason to have a business breakfast/lunch at the Cracked Egg.",

Here's the deal: I have loved Monte Cristo sandwiches since I was a kid, not that I eat them much, but when I do I really enjoy them. For those who don't know, a Monte Cristo is a turkey, ham, and swiss on french toast, fried so the cheese is melted. The Cracked Egg's version is battered and then deep fried. It is so rich and sinful, but, my god, it is delicious. The bacon on the side was also excellent and cooked to perfection. My wife had scrambled eggs, sausage links and toast, all excellent. It's a bit pricey for a breakfast place, but you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommend. This was the Cheyenne location, I have no idea how the others are.",

Although there were people waiting I was promptly seated as I was only a party of one.   As far as the food is concerned, their hashbrowns are lightly browned, not overcooked. Their eggs were to order and seasoned in the right fashion.   A few notable items on their menu is the monte cristo which is a battered sandwich with cheese and ham. The eggs benedict's are a sure heart attack full of flavor waiting to be savored. Egg sandwiches, biscuits and gravy and specialty pancakes are also a must here.  If your feeling for something light, the fresh fruit is very fresh and ripe for the asking.  This place also does lunch serving breakfast and lunchtime sandwiches.",

    "text": "The egg-themed breakfast joints in Vegas tend to blend together after a while, and while the Cracked Egg is very good, there's nothing terribly distinctive about it either.  We came on a Saturday morning about 10 a.m., so it was prime time, but despite that, we were seated within five minutes. The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.  Our drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.  The rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.  Because I live on the opposite side of the valley from the Cracked Egg, I probably wouldn't seek it out again (as other comparable venues such as Eggworks are closer), but if I was in the neighborhood one morning? Sure!",

    "text": "We just decided to try this place yesterday morning. We were so impressed that we came back again this morning. That says a lot, in my opinion.  Most of the food is very, very good, but I want to start things off by mentioning the one dish that caused me to drop this from a 5 to a 4 star review: the coffee cake. I'm not really a big cake fan, but after reading all of the glowing reviews, I decided to give theirs a shot. Any quality it might of had was instantly and unforgivably overridden by that distinct, tell-tale taste and texture of a microwave! What the hell? A microwave? Yeah, sure, that's the kind of taste-deadening, corner-cutting, smoke & mirrors crap people expect from a Taco Bell, but not at a place like this. It was really disappointing and, being the first dish out, a rather disheartening first-impression too. I've read people's reviews, where they talk about how \"steamy\" and \"fresh\" it is, but the steam is artificial and the \"fresh\" appearance is completely False. At least to anyone clever enough to understand that, unless you time things unnaturally well, no cake is likely to ever be served \"steaming fresh\" at a restaurant, that is. Considering how good and legitimately-fresh the rest of the food is, this approach really, REALLY baffles me. Trust me, guys, your cake would be so much better if you a) cooked several batches a day or b) just left it room temperature and honest. Microwaving your food is flat-out insulting to your business and your customers. I thoroughly enjoyed both of my meals, but I wouldn't step in that cake again. Really disgusting bullshit! Get it together!  Beyond that, everything else tasted fantastic (thus the 4 stars)! I simply detest eggs, so I order my meals without. Yesterday, I had the \"Mexican skillet\" and, boy howdy, it was great! The chorizo and salsa were an awesome compliment to the already phenomenal potatoes. I see myself having this same dish again quite soon. Today, I had the country fried steak and it was, honestly, one of the best I've ever eaten. The steak was tender and juicy and the breading was crisp and well-seasoned. Really, really good stuff. I will also be having it again soon. My wife had the biscuits and gravy, which she said was really good, but not quite the way she likes them. Then again, she apparently had that particular bar set quite high when she was younger. She also had the huevos rancheros, which she said was excellent.   Also, both days, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, though I do wish people/servers would understand that \"water\" doesn't mean \"water with lemon\". I know this is apparently standard practice at many restaurants, but I personally think that, if someone orders just \"water\", you should probably ask if they want a strong-flavored fruit wedge submerged in it before just automatically adding it. Maybe that's just us, but much like with every other single aspect of my dining experiences, If I don't specifically ask for something, I DO NOT want it. Simple enough?  With all of that being said, there really isn't any question about us being repeat customers here. There are some problems, but the staff is pretty friendly and most of the food is absolutely phenomenal.",

It was a bit longer than the 10 minutes the hostess suggested -- almost 20, but we managed to get a seat and it wasn't a big deal.  I ordered eggs benedict, as I always do on my first run in a new breakfast spot and I wasn't disappointed. Of the places I've tried so far in Vegas, this was the best eggs benny I'd had... even better the Wynn's buffet.  The service was cordial, but not overly fussy. The coffee was good and even though we were seated by the bathroom/kitchen area, it wasn't really a bother. Someone's got to sit there, right?  Of the places I've been thus far, this would be my first choice when picking a breakfast spot. Looking forward to going back and trying some of their delicious-sounding omelettes.",

Sure, you might not have unlimited champagne, bloody mary's or mimosas... but the flavor of the food here can't be beat.   My party of 4 was thoroughly pleased... I had the special, which was some sort of grilled chicken with spinach and mushrooms and cheese on sourdough bread. The chicken was succulent, not overdone but not underdone. The sourdough was toasty and firm (not soggy from sitting too long). The mushrooms and spinach tasted fresh and coupled with the cheese provided a great flavor/texture contract.   My dad had the South Shore omelette... he actually finished everything. That's a good sign for him.   Other diners had the Carnitas Omelette and Eggs Benedict. 4 thumbs up from them.   Service was great, never had to ask for more coffee or water. Atmosphere isn't sexy or trend-setting, but comfortable and fitting. The bill was reasonable... about what you'd expect from any diner in the country. I'd definitely go there again!",

I got the South Shore Scramble (1st Photo) and you get the choice of either hash brown or seasoned potatoes. I got hash brown and white toast. I did feel like the toast I got was smaller than what i saw other customers get (2nd Photo). Other than that it was really good. My boyfriend got the Country Fried Steak (3rd Photo) with the seasoned potatoes and the coffee cake (4th Photo). The coffee cake didn't taste anything like coffee it tasted more like a lemon cake, but it still tasted good. The portions of the food was good for its price and the ambience of the place was nice. We came in at around 9:30 and there was no wait time, and we got our food within 10-15 minutes. Customer service was really good and our waiter was really nice. Overall I would give them a 4.5 stars. I highly recommend coming here!",

But I simply went with scrambled eggs turkey sausage and hash browns and wheat toast. The wait was about 15 minutes. I Requested my eggs scrambled medium.  Let me first start off, my eggs were a bit still watery which threw me off. My turkey sausage was really dry, and I do wish my hash browns was cooked more, no crispness or browning on the hash brown. It was a bit depressing. I still ate it all because I was hungry.   Breakfast is so simple to cook, how could you not know how to hit all the right points on it. I'm not trying to be mean, probably it was just busy and it got hectic in the kitchen, sh*t happens.. But  if I'm ever in area, Id rather pass on this place.    But the customer service was great! The place is awesome tho. Looks like a big kitchen.",

You have the option of coffee cake in lieu of toast.... But it's basically angel food cake with apples in it, so I'm not sure what's exciting about that. Two people in my party excitedly ordered the corned beef hash and neither were excited about or finished their plate. I had the sweet potato and apple skillet which would've had potential if it were a) seasoned even a little b) someone had enough knife skills to properly dice an onion. I really don't need an apple-slice sized piece of caramelized onion. Lastly, the Munster cheese melted on the top just turned into a congealed mess before it even made it to the table. 1 star for pleasant service, 1 star for perfectly Poached eggs.",

    "text": "Continuing our search for the perfect breakfast restaurant, this was the second Cracked Egg we sampled.  The food was very good, not spectacular but very good.  I had the Big Bad Wolf omelet, and it was properly named.  Packed with heart-stopping meats surrounded by the omelet it was really fit for a wolf.  The hash-browns were good too, but I had to let most of them go just to get the omelet stuffed in.  Being gluten intolerant I didn't eat the coffee cake, which my wife said was good as well,  And my cake gave her a second one to take home for later.  She also had the chicken fried steak which she really enjoyed.  The negatives and reason this is not five stars is that there was a fair wait to be seated.  Luckily it was a nice day and we could sit outside on the food-court seating.  Inside waiting is minimal. I admit we are slow starters, and came at the peak hour, so maybe if you are an early riser there might not be so much of a wait.  Also, being full and the seating closely set it was rather noisy inside.  I am not the first to post the \"no WiFi photo\" but I have posted it again to bring it to the front because their admonition to talk like it's 1995 was being followed with gusto.    Still, once seated the service was quick and the staff was very friendly and most helpful.  And that often makes up for any bumps in the road.    And fie on me, I am so used to eating around my gluten intolerance that I didn't ask if they had a gluten free menu, which I discovered after I had eaten my fill.  On the other hand, I did mention it and the gluten free menu wasn't offered.  Next time I will ask.",

    "text": "We came here by default because the ever so popular babystacks was over an 1 hour and 20 minute wait.   The wait wasn't too long here, we waited a good 15 minutes on Sunday - Mother's Day to be exact.   We ordered:  The Cracked Croissant - $10.75 we love buttery croissant breakfast sandwiches, so this was a definite for us. We chose sunny side up eggs and the runny yolk was rich and delicious with the sandwich. We also chose the sausage patty and a side of soggy hash browns - I'm thinking of asking them to make them well done and crispier next time. Overall I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but everything combined made for a great (expensive) breakfast sandwich. 4/5  Cakes & Eggs Combo - $8.50 I chose sunny side up eggs (comes with 2), bacon (comes with 2), and substituted the regular pancakes (comes with 2) with the Coconut macadamia pancakes (comes with 2) - bad decision.  The sunny side eggs were fried to perfection - both eggs had an extremely luscious and runny yolk. The eggs were very sweet and fresh. I wish the bacon was crispy, it was rather soggy. 3/5   Now onto the pancakes, they had an extra cost to substitute them ($1.50 or so) for the coconut macadamia pancakes. So not worth it! Although the pancakes were fluffy, they were also very dry. The pancakes had the faintest coconut flavor (actually, I barely tasted it) the \"coconut flavor\" was more like a prank. It did have dry coconut flakes, which was not texturally pleasing and only 7 small pieces of macadamia nuts throughout the entire pancake! It sounded better on paper than what was actually brought to the table. I wasn't satisfied or happy with these pancakes - they were a lie. 1/5  It was pricey for what we ended up getting. My favorites were their sunny side up eggs and the sausage. You can get that anywhere!",

Very friendly waitress  We ordered the monte cristo  Ham , turkey,  Swiss cheese in french toast deep fried!  & a Denver omlet , which she kindly let me substitute sausage instead of ham. ( im 8 months pregnant & picky )  Both came with potatoes ( hash or seasoned , we ordered one of each) & the omlet came with toast or coffee cake! I ordered coffee cake. Two waters & one soda. To our surprise our food was ready so fast! Mayb 10 mins!  ( idk maybe we got lucky! ) We both LOVED our meals & were so satisfied. They have large portions. ( Omlets are jade with 3 eggs)  We both took half our meals home! The COFFEE CAKE is to die for! Best I've ever had. Seriously so moist & sweet. Loved it. I would go back just for the cake.  Prices were fair. More or less IHOP type prices. ( but the quality is much better)  Our total was 23 dollars & change.  I have nothing to complain about.  I didn't hear one complaint from any customers around me. I find that rare , I always here someone at least say, \"oh you forgot this\" but no everyone was on their game!  My bf hates going out to dine in places, ( he's a homebody) but said he would love to come back to this place! We plan to take family & friends here when they come out to Vegas to visit  Great job to the staff! A++ thanks guys!",

I have never seen where someone took French toast and between the bread is like a raspberry jam or filling. Was topped with fresh raspberries that tasted like it came right off the plant! Very goooood! Then the sausage was the nice big thick links which I love and they were delicious also! Came to around 14$ for the meal not including the tip so to me was worth it. I also liked the place it self with the decorations and the way they have it set up ;). Definitely will be coming back to try the peanut butter French toast next!",

    "text": "I love the Cracked Egg!  It is a great breakfast/lunch place that you NEED to check out!  The menu is fantastic here.  The breakfast side has all of your favorites, along with some more fun options to spice up your breakfast.  I think my favorite breakfast dish is the Cakes & Eggs combo.  Eggs any style, sausage/bacon, hash browns and pancakes.  Everything that makes breakfast wonderful in one serving.  YUM!  For brunch, you have got to get the Monte Cristo sandwich.  It is a ham, turkey, and cheese club made with French Toast!!!!  Yep, you heard me right, French Toast.  I absolutely love this sandwich.  The lunch menu is great as well.  My husbands dreams about the tuna melts, my daughter demands their chicken fingers, and I usually grab a burger.  So far, everything I have tried has been tasty and have not been disappointed one bit.  They also have a membership program that you can sign up for free.  Once you are in the system, they will send you an $8 off coupon every month.  The coupon has no rules except you have to come in, simple as that.  So sign up for the club and start getting coupons.  The club also gives you a $10 off check for every $250 you spend.  Don't you just love coupons?  With tons of variety so that everyone in your group can find something to eat, makes the Cracked Egg a great place to visit! The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome. Oh and the coffee cake is divine!  That is the trifecta of a great restaurant in my opinion.  Go check it out and be amazed.",

All the booths were taken when we went here , and we took that as a good sign. We didn't have to wait longer than maybe 15 minutes for one though. They have a good kids menu and good pencils and activity menu to keep the children entertained. I had a breakfast burrito with eggs potatoes and cheese and added spinach and it was delicious. The service was very good and they were very attentive and on top of everything . We were very happy with everything and will definitely be going back",

My first time coming was 10:30-11:00 am and it was a full house but didnt have a long wait time to be seated. Nor was it a long wait to be greeted and for our food to come. The food was amazing, very filling, nice amount for the buck. My wife got biscuits and gravy and could not finish the plate, but did enjoy every bite. I got chicken fried steak, absolutely wonderful. Very satisfied with my decision to come and the employees were great. I WILL be coming back",

I had the Veggy Benny - the Veggie Eggs Benedict, that is. Um, delicious! A fluffy biscuit, grilled tomato, spinach and poached egg, served with Cajun style potatoes. Their hollandaise is amazing. I started dipping the potatoes in it.  My bro-in-law's coffee cake came as an \"appetizer\". I had a piece. I was so cakey, moist and warm. And it had some kind of fruit it in...cherries? Who knows. It was fabulous. I also tried my niece's chocolate chip pancakes. Yum. She was also a happy camper.  All the kids (niece and nephews) enjoyed their bacon. And syrup. And the bacon in the syrup.",

I ordered my usual the Northshore Scramble which has tomatoes, grilled onions, bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheese, with sour cream on  top. It came with seasoned potatoes and I ordered avocado on the side. It was good as always especially on top of the buttered sourdough bread. The seasoned potatoes also had a good flavor and they were not salty.   My husband ordered a Tuna Salad sandwich with a side of fries. They accidentally gave him fresh fruit but when they found out their mistake they also gave him  his fries. I had a bite of the sandwich and the tuna was really good it had a \"zing\" to the taste.   I like the location of this Cracked Egg because it's inside a little mini food court that has a Starbucks, Subway, Gyro, and Pizza place. It has something for everyone just in case you are with people with different tastes you can all eat together in their outdoor seating area.",

It's is for this reason,  that I attribute my dissatisfaction to the led than perfect rating that I've given.   In effort to keeping on schedule, and allowing for preparation for my next stop,  I opted to call in my order. Only to find my calls unanswered on both attempts. The parking lot illustrated  that there should not be many to warrant a busy occurrence such as answered calls. So I found myself walking in to place my order in person. From there, everything  went without a hitch.  Food was made so very timely and there was more than enough staff to accommodate my phone order.   I don't like writing bad reviews so when I do experience less them 5 star service,  I include as much detail as possible. There was nothing wrong with their phones because a test call went  right through while I waited for my food to arrive and my earlier call was mere 40 feet away.   Bottom line, this place still rocks. Just don't rely on saving time by calling in ahead. There may be something that prevents the call from being taken.  :/",

Not only do they offer unique breakfasts that no one else does, but it's always very fresh and tasty. The other thing that's really awesome about this place is that they pay attention to small details.   If your order something that comes with salsa they make sure to heat it up for you so your eggs/breakfast won't get cold. And when you order bread without butter they don't make the mistake of putting it on there.  Another thing that I absolutely love is that they offer Gluten free bread or muffins if you can't have gluten, which is the case for me.  And every time I've been here I've never had a problem with service. Every waitress is friendly, fast and efficient. They always go out of their way to make your experience super awesome.  I absolutely love it here and can't wait to eat breakfast here again when I'm back in town! A million thanks!!!  2 thumbs up for The Cracked Egg on West Cheyenne!",

Came back in smh the girls tells me again \"it's being packed up\" so I sat down! I walked out the door with my food at 11:03 with my order. The front girl is full shit. Saying they are backed up, as I stand there and see hella open tables and chairs wasn't even a wait people was being seated as they walk in. Today is her \"Friday\" so Probably why she just telling me whatever I want to hear! But pissed me off the girl who brought my food to me ... hit me with \"I'm sorry for your wait and walked off \" smh you could see on her face she didn't at all. ",

It was just 2 of us, the hostess was better than great with her wait estimate of 10 min, we got seated in about 7 min. We both really like bacon and avocado, so we ordered the Californian omelette with Hash. I opted for the coffee cake which was a nice, sweet, fluffy cake with chocolate and glaze. It's a good substitute to have as a side than pancakes for me. What was awesome was their no holds barred policy of no WiFi, and challenging patrons to be human again in an age without a mobile device and have a verbal conversation.",

We come every Saturday for breakfast and have always been treated with the best customer service, however today was not like that. We checked in with the hostess stand at 9:18am for a party of 5 + a high chair quoting us a wait time of 10 minutes. There were many tables AND booths open for us to be seated at, with no other large parties waiting. They could have easily seated us and let us enjoy our breakfast meal per usual, but instead they whispered to each other that they were waiting for a different party to finish eating so we could be seated where they were, all the way in the back. It is now 9:59am and we have yet to be seated. We have never received such poor customer service before from this establishment - I do not think we'll be bringing our weekly business back here. Very sad as we have always enjoyed this location as our family Saturday routine.",

I looked up the scanner and the user manual states that if the money has been through the wash, if it has been crumpled or if it is dirty it will fail their scan yet they don't even have a starch pen as backup.

I don't hate because of the food...more on that to come....I hate it for it's very location and arrangement.  Conflict.....How does this warrant a four star review?  It's because the food is consistently....awesome!  Depending on the hour of visit, you might have to wait.  Depending on your size of your party....you may have to wait for tables to be arranged.  Depending on the operational tempo of the staff...the frequency of visits by staff might suffer.  But the chow......always solid.  On my most recent visit, because I have been slow-carbing it since the beginning of the year, I opted for a few simple things.  I ordered up a water, avocado, and jalapeno bacon. There was some confusion as to who ordered up some coffee,  I figured I would take because I knew the coffee was good to go.  The avocado (1/2) slice was fresh and delicious.  The bacon....spicy and all that is bacon.  $10....with tip....whatever.  Not my first choice for breakfast.....certainly not my last...When I have to go as a group to TCE....I am game, but only if it's under my own optimal conditions.",

I believe the longest I had to wait for seating was about 10 minutes, nothing more.  The servers are always friendly and very attentive. Also, food comes out in very good time. Coffee and water is constantly refilled. And paying at the end of the meal consists of going up to the register.  The omelette or scramble choices here are pretty good. Do not ask for soft scramble! My eggs came out pretty runny when I asked for them not to be. But for next time, I know not to ask for soft, instead medium scramble.  The coffee cake here is to die for. I usually get a slice of it and it comes out nice and hot. They also have variations of the coffee cake from week to week.  Is it my first breakfast place joint of choice? No. But it's definitely not my last.",

With this being said, I'm absolutely thrilled to have discovered The Cracked Egg on my yearly birthday trip to Vegas.    Don't be fooled by the cheesy stripmall-esque appearance of this restaurant.  'Tis a fine establishment.  If gluten is not a part of your life, you will love the gluten free pancakes that are served.  Since being diagnosed, I've had some gummy-ass, disgusting pancakes at other restaurants.  The Cracked Egg however serves up two huge gluten free pancakes.  Pair this with a banana topping, eggs and their crisp bacon and you've got a Full House!    Don't worry - you gluten eaters can enjoy a great selection of foody faire as well!",

They serve the eggs on a very thick slice of ham, which had a really smooth smoky flavor.The home fries are delicious! The second time I went was on a Saturday morning, which meant waiting for 45 minutes for a table. That time I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was very satisfying. It was a large piece of steak and had the nice crispy crust that I like. The gravy was rich and smooth, not chalky like some tend to be. My Mother-in-law ordered the french toast and loved it.   I really like this place, it's just too long of a wait and a little overpriced.",

I've been to cracked egg twice so far. the first time it was slow and the service was even slower. the 2nd time i went it was busier. and the service was still terribly slow. 1) never took our drink order. 2) went straight to food order cause of long wait. 2) forgot my coffee cake 3) forgot my to go box. 4) forgot my to go box. AGAIN. proceeding long wait. it is a bad sign when your waitress has to apologize to you every time she approaches the table. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.  side note: i did get the same waitress both visits.   had the PB stuff french toast. SUPER DUPER YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!! if you're looking for something sweet savory and all around goodness. this will hit the spot. its heavy so don't expect to be productive the rest of the bad. pair that with the coffee cake and its game over. nap time. i could only eat half.  also had the corn beef hash. quite good as well. i felt like they were filling the giant platter they brought me with potato though to use as a filler to cover up the plate. i didn't like the additional semi mashed potato added to my corned beef plus the additional side of potatoes/hash browns. that's a little potato overload.  okay. granted the terrible service might be due to a terrible waitress. it still put a damper on my experience. their lucky the food is good or i wouldn't come back.",

I had the enchilada omelet and it had nasty American processed cheese on it I guess that's what they use for omelets and that probably doesn't bother most people but It makes me gag.. Ew on the menu it says jack cheese but it should add that it's processed. Anyways enough of the cheese rant. The service was good and the coffee cake was really good.",

    "text": "What is with the residents of Las Vegas? Do they actually LIKE to pay good money for a mediocre Breakfast?   On the menu...  Joe's Scramble (** $9.75) Three Eggs scrambled with seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions, and Jack and Cheddar Cheese.  Before arriving here, I performed my due diligence and read the many positive reviews on Yelp, and how the Scrambles were described as \"HUGE\" (not my description...) or \"Hearty\".   I was really disappointed when I saw my \"Joe's Scramble\" heading towards me... The Scramble part of the meal only took up a third of the eight inch plate... the rest of the space taken up by what the restaurant described as Seasoned Potatoes... and, BTW, the portion of Potatoes were not HUGE, either.   I always felt that a restaurant should name an Entree what the primary flavor that the Diner would taste first... and in this particular case... it's the huge amount of Cheese that is layered over the Scramble. A LOT of Jack and Cheddar. This entree is a Cheese Scramble, for sure.  It would take a Forensic Scientist to even find the Ground Beef or the Spinach! And in this particular entree... I really felt that the meat was not all Ground Beef... Tasted like Beef and some other kind of meat.  The Country Potatoes (*** 1/2) was pretty good, but very small portions. Do you know how a Scrabble (the word game) Tile is shaped? That's the size of each chopped Potato with Seasoned Salt added during frying.  Coffee Cake (*** included with meal) Very sweet... But, I have to ask... When did a Coffee Cake have a Jelly Filling?  This really surprised me... never, ever had a Jelly filled Coffee Cake before.  Coffee (*** 1/2 $2.00) Unlimited re-fills.  And then... I received the Bill... Over $41... My mouth dropped in amazement! I looked at what I ordered... the two people that accompanied me (my youngest son and his future father-in-law) and what they ordered. With the tip included... this is as close to a $50 meal as you can get! And, take my word, this is NOT a $50 buck meal! No way, no how!  I asked my youngest, who ordered the Homemade Ground Beef Hash ($10.95) how he liked his Breakfast... He said the Mary Kitchen Hash found at Supermarkets was better than Hash in his meal (and, BTW, he's a Chef!). His comments are not part of the eventual rating...  The Future In-Law had The Cracked Croissant ($10.25)... No comments from that side of the family... I stated that the next time he would visit the \"Big Valley\", that I'd take him to some 5-Star Breakfast places vastly superior to the Cracked Egg... and some that served authentic Joe's Specials. For the rest of you... just search my reviews for Joe's Specials...  Apologies to present and future Family Members for dragging them here...  To aid this restaurant... here is a recipe for Joe's Special I researched on the Internet... notice how much MORE Beef there is... and the amount of Spinach... hint, hint..  Joe's Special  2T Olive or Vegetable Oil 2lb lean Ground Beef 2 medium Onions, finely chopped 2 Garlic Cloves, finely minced 1/2lb sliced mushrooms 1 1/4t Salt 1/4t ground Nutmeg 1/4t dry Oregano 1/4t Pepper 1/2lb Spinach, rinsed, stems removed, and leaves chopped (about 4 cups) 4-6 lg Eggs, lightly beaten  1 Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Crumble in beef and cook, stirring often, until browned. Drain excess fat. 2 Add onions, garlic and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. 3 Stir in salt, nutmeg, pepper, oregano and spinach; cook for about 5 more minutes. Add eggs. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, just until eggs are softly set.   Now... I ask you... doesn't this read good?",

Being younger, I assume that my server assumed me being young meant that I would tip her less than 20%. That was not the case as she ignored me my whole experience. I took it up to the register and the problem wasn't addressed. I got a measly senior discount. Though I appreciate a discounted check for a mediocre experience, that doesn't change anything.  Also noticed that their is an option between COFFEE CAKE or TOAST..  She insisted on just asking me what kind of TOAST I wanted. I didn't want TOAST. I wanted COFFEE CAKE and as a returning guest, I let her know that.   Other experiences at the location have been awesome. As well as the fe visits i've paid to the ANN location.  I am a big fan of their seasoned potatoes.",

So one day on a whim & the fact that I was starving, we ventured down here on a Sunday, fairly early I might add, so the wait wasn't too bad.   It was still pretty busy, which is always a good sign ;)   I perused the menu & finally decided on the Sweet potato skillet, however, I opted for ham instead of bacon. It was definitely interesting. Sweet potatoes, green apples, muenster cheese, ham, grilled onions & an egg over easy to top it off, with a side of coffee cake as well.   It was pretty good, considering the sweet potatoes could've been seasoned a little better, nothing a lil hot sauce couldn't fix though ;) I would probably order it again. The coffee cake was super moist & delicious too, and I'm not a huge coffee cake fan either.   I would definitely come back & look forward to trying some of the other menu items.",

I ordered the enchillada omlete which had a scant amount of chicken in it, had a generic tasting diiluted enchillada sauce over it with sliced pepper jack cheese slices not quite melted on top. The tortilla chips were missing as was the green chili the menu promised. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was a pre frozen mystery meat  Pattie with gravy that he said was just ok. I guess for the high dollar amount for this meal,  Dennys is a better option. We have eaten at other Cracked eggs and have never walked away unhappy.  Walking to the register I noticed a customer's coffee cake.. it was very yummy looking, it even had sTruesle on top, ours did not. I asked the girl at the register about it and she said, snickering, \"yeah sometimes they come out good other times not so much.\"  I managed  restraunts in the past, I would have died of embarrassment knowing a piece of anything went out that wasn't the best! Looks like the whole place is run by 20 some things that really don't care. We obviously will not be back.",

My second visit was even more delicious and consisted of a country Benny with home fries. You are wondering what a country Benny is... well a country Benny is a biscuit instead of English muffin, sausage instead of Canadian bacon, and Sausage gravy instead of hollandaise sauce.  Simply amazing!  Cracked egg for the win The staff is very friendly as well.  Cheers",

There was about a 10 minute wait, the place was pretty busy when we got there.   There were about 2 waitresses waiting on all tables. It took some time for someone to finally come to take our orders. We were waiting I'd say about 10 minutes or so. We decided to order specials that was on the board. Overall taste of food was pretty good. We had Daisy's Benie and one other type of special, which I can't remember at the moment. Both were fully loaded and there was so much food on the plate including some fried potatoes and we couldn't finish our dishes. Daisy's Benie was tasted like a Mexican type dis and was full of flavor. I would definitely eat here again, yet try something new.",

No matter which location you land at, its always packed which only exemplifies how popular they are ... especially on weekends ... especially after a Friday night party we threw at the house .... especially after a hangover! Nothing a hearty breakfast wont tame.  i ordered the \"Big bad wolf\" ( named after me of course! ) and the mrs. ordered the country benny. One thing i noticed is that they charge more for a small cup of coffee here than a venti Starbucks. You can opt for either toast or hot coffee cake. I took the coffee cake of course.  No surprises with the food and the wait, even though they were very busy was only 10 minutes. The service here is A+. The food? A+.   Another added bonus is that its only minutes from the casa. If you make a habit of coming here every weekend, it will be a very expensive habit at $30 a pop.  After your meal, you wait in line at the reception - cashier area which gets congested because its right next to the entry with a constant flow of people. They should have you pay at the table.",

My boyfriend has tried other meals and he's never had anything bad to say about any of them. If you are getting a meal that lets you choose between I think toast or the coffee cake, definitely choose the cake. It's delicious!! You won't be disappointed. It is sweet though so be prepared for that. They have different flavors throughout the year and they've all been really good. It does get really busy, especially on the weekends so make sure you plan ahead to wait a bit. On a positive note tho, even when the place was packed, after ordered, we got our food super fast.",

We were seated pretty quickly...the place was full.  I decided to be different and order the corn beef hash.  Usually I go for the boring eggs and potatoes but I was going all out that day.  The portion was massive.  Alot of onions...like more than the corn beef but I just ate around them.  It came with eggs (egg beaters) potatoes on the side and wheat toast.  Whew it was alot and by alot I mean ALOT!  When I was done she asked if I liked it because it didnt look like I ate anything. haha  It was pretty darn good though.   I probably would get it again.    The BF ordered the kickin potatoes and the crumb cake.  Kickin potatoes are always solid...a combo of potatoes, bacon, cheese, salsa and sour cream (I think thats whats in it)   He loves them.  Now the crumb cake....amazing as usual.  Sometimes they come in different flavors but this time it was just plain cinnamon-just the way I like.  It was so hot when it came out that it was steaming.  the cake just fell apart as you tried to cut through it.  Just the little things.  Cracked Egg is always a solid local find.  There arent too many breakfast places that are not chain restaurants that I can say live up to the breakfast standards but this one surely does!",

And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!  The Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.    The day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!  Menu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.  The Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \"Breanne's Basics\" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \"Eggs With Attitude\" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \"The Benedicts\" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \"Fluffy & Folded\" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \"Sin City Skillets\" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \"From the Griddle\" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.    The Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.  Only gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.  Stop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!",

Asked for eggs to be over medium but came in over easy, however there'hing wrong with runny eggs over your bacon cheeseburger goodness. The included coffee cake with its sweet notes and creamy center was an excellent compliment to the dishes savory notes.   Menu pricing is fair. Service is stellar.    Store opens at 6am..perfect.   I would see myself frequenting this place.",

    "text": "Headed there this Sunday morning...Busy as usual.  We were told 15 min wait but it was more like 1/2 an hour.  This morning my hubby ordered the veggie skillet (seasoned potatoes, shrooms, broccoli, spinach & tomatoes , eggs) & added corned beef.  I had the California Omelette (avocado, bacon & jack cheese) with the skillet potatoes.    My omelette was fine.  The bacon inside was not cut up causing it to be a bit more difficult to bite into without taking half the bacon in a single bite!The potatoes were perfect-no grease what so ever! My hubby was pleased with his skillet but was slightly disappointed that it took forever to get his coffee (which is not worth the $2.00 price).   Given how busy the place was, service was good (even with the lag in coffee).  We also had an $8.00 coupon sent to us by that Cracked Egg making it a good deal.  Withoout the coupon I doubt we would make a special trip out there any time too soon.",

We scanned yelp and it told us about the Cracked Egg.   We got there a little late, around 9:30 on a Friday morning.   We were promptly seated and received oj and coffee.   I ordered Joe's scramble and my buddy ordered an omelet.   Both were really good with large portions.   One thing they do at the Cracked Egg is to add cream cheese to the eggs to make them a little smoother and richer.  It's a nice touch if you like cream cheese.   The only complaint I have is they forgot our toast.   But the portions were so large, we really didn't miss the toast.   Also, the place was a little noisy due to a party of six celebrating a birthday.   But other than that, it was a nice place to grab some breakfast.    Will I be back?   Sure, I could see myself going back at some point.",

I was a regular for years and my schedule changed, and so didn't get to visit, plus fell out of the habit of eating breakfast out. (Although, they do serve lunch which is great, I primarily have always gone for the breakfast no matter early morning or early afternoon.)  They recognized me the moment I entered, as core staff is stable, which makes it so great. I missed the coffee cake, which is favorite for folks.  Omelet was fabulous,  and the side of fruit I substituted for the potatoes,  which are also yummy,  but I wanted fruit, was substantial and tasted great.  Too much to eat all of it, so I took half home.  They have a loyalty card program and the manager for this original location, Armando,  remembered me by name, and is his usual friendly self.  So great to go back and see it is just as great as I remembered and full of the ambiance and familiarity,  feeling like returning home.",

I think this is my second time going in 5 years and now i know why.  There's no one to greet you with a smile it's kind of chaos everyone and mind you this is on a Thursday morning.  So finally get seated quickly and hastily. Wait for the server to take our order. She comes by promptly and takes our order and leaves. I got the southwest scramble no chorizo sub avocado. Which you would think is fine? Right. But i have to pay for avocado even if i take the chorizo off. All the breakfast spots I've been to gladly make this accommodation for me since I'm not a meat eater. Either way i was okay with it and then my bf orders the eggs benedict. He took a bite into it and looked grossed out. Said his ham was all rubbery. We quickly finished the food because we had a doctors appointment right across.   Now it's time to check out and I'm shocked by their rule to receive military discount. We are both veterans and both have active IDs from the VA that could be cross checked with my normal ID (if needed) but however we were turned away for not being in uniform.  That was the cherry on the top.  Anyways, pretty disappointing and won't be returning.",

Instead of just your basic home fries or hash browns they also offer coffee cake.

Growth Hormone- laden beef is famous for lacking real beef flavor- and that seems to be the only way this beef tasted more like dishwater and less like natural beef!!",

Our servers/bussers were very accommodating and seemed very eager to take care of us. Very friendly and punctual with refills and such.  We all ordered simple... French toast and pancakes and they turned out perfectly! Prices are fair for breakfast food. Will definitely be returning to this spot for future breakfasts with family!",

Whether we sit out on the patio or inside at a long table, the wait staff is always hovering around us (a good thing) to make sure we're very very well taken care of.  I usually get the sweet potato skillet with Jalapeno's added, cause I love the hot of the peppers with the sweet of the apples and sweet potatoes in this dish.  The Oatmeal Overload is also just YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!  Mic got a Monte Cristo sandwich which must have been really good 'cause we didn't take any home!  We'll be back.  I'm sure!!!",

The chicken fried steak was crisp & tender, the coffee cake was delish, & their bacon was perfectly thick & ridiculously meaty. The service as soon as you walk in was top notch as they ask for your name to seat you.

CHILE VERDE RANCHEROS an open-faced tortilla with black beans, seasoned pork and two eggs any style. topped with chile verde sauce, jack cheese and sour cream was on the side but I will say this dish looked like an appetizer. I was quite disappointed, but as I began to dig in and the flavors started to work on me I realized WOW! This is really good. Along side my English tea I was really satisfied by the end of the meal and more full than I expected. Overall the service was better than good, the service was on point and the setting looked packed but they set us up very nice! A small critique try not to bump into the customers chairs so much!

Nothing too fancy just your typical breakfast and brunch fare. Humble and welcoming vibe. No judgement if you show up in your pjs (not that I ever would) but nice to know it doesn't really matter here. And even though the line looks long, you'll never have to wait longer than 20 minutes to be seated.   I'm a creature of habit, so I prefer the omelettes and sub. with egg whites. The go-to, The Californian (of course). Anything topped with avocado and bacon is alright in my book. The green omelette is a must try as well. Not a huge fan of the coffee cake (hard pass) mostly because I don't like sweets at breakfast. I want savory. And a cup of coffee too so keep it comin'.  ;)",

Amazeballs. And it was definitely worth sharing, cause that thing was HUGE. Then we tried the peanut butter french toast. A little too sweet and not peanut-buttery enough for my taste, but it was good. I'll try the croissant french toast next time. And then I had an eggs benedict. By myself. It was delish! I know, i eat like hungry hippo.  Service was alright, nothing to write yelp about. Atmosphere was pleasant. Price was appropriate. I'll definitely be back to eat my way through the rest of the menu :)  The missing star is because of the wait.. Not their fault , but what can i say, i was feelin the HANGER. :/",

The manager Armando is a close friend of mine and I liked the place so much I got a job there in high school. They treat their employees very well and it shows in their high quality service.

They care about the restaurant and seem like a big family. If your server doesn't bring you a coffee refill, someone else will.   To anyone that thinks Babystacks is better: the village must have lost an idiot. We went to Babystacks this morning.  It was horrible. The seating is very uncomfortable. The staff is all young and seem very inexperienced. The food was subpar with a higher price tag.  Would never eat there again.

She was more interested in saying \"no\" than in saying \"I will be glad to do that for you\". She says management prohibits substitutions. I never heard of a breakfast place not allowing a swap of toast ofr pancakes. I could care less if i pay a little more, they just do not allow it without buying two complete breakfasts.

The steak and eggs included a good sized and perfectly cooked steak. I will definitely go back when I'm in town, it's a place worth driving out of your way to.",

They were tasteless and the Hollandaise was watery, not thick and creamy. Ended up throwing most of it away.  Their prices are a bit much, especially on such simple items.  Although, I ate some of my fiancee's S'mores French Toast with Nutella and it was amazing. And huge portions as well. They had some really interesting menu choices that ARE worth the price.  Case in point, can be worth it if you end up getting what you pay for.",

I probably could have made the same quality of food in my kitchen. It's just goes to show if you have a market and your in there at the right place, at the right time.",

Not only does clean ice taste better in your drink, it makes it colder. My husband will not take lemon in his tea because most people don't wash theirs, but here not only are lemons washed, so are the bananas etc. They use tongs when buttering the toast too! So many restaurants have kitchens that after seeing them you wouldn't want to eat there, but we enjoy sitting at the counter occasionally just to watch the smooth operations of a well kept, organized kitchen! Armando is the manager & will correct any problem you may have, if any! We eat here at least 2-3 times a week & thoroughly enjoy all the staff along with the delicious food. And don't forget to ask what the latest flavor of coffee cake is being served at the moment... delicious no matter what flavor!",

Had a couple items that came out wrong and they were taken care of promptly.    Overall the food was ok.  The menu is extensive and the combinations sound interesting, but none of us were won over by our meals.  Presentation is lacking, which is overlooked if the food tastes delicious, however the meals were a bit bland.  I had the Enchilada Omelet with hash browns and the coffee cake.  The sauce seemed simple and possibly was a store bought sauce, nothing stood out.  There was a fair amount of chicken and plenty of cheese, but wasn't what I thought it would be flavor wise in the end.  Hash browns were ordered extra crispy and weren't made that way.  They returned them to the kitchen and came back perfectly crisp.  The coffeecake was a nice portion, but not what I would call \"coffeecake\".  It was a chocolate chip cake about three inches high with a drizzle on top.  Kind of crumbly, but good flavor.  I'm just used to a more traditional denser cake with a heavy brown sugar crumb on top.    I asked the rest of the group what they thought and they all kind of said their meal was ok.  I would eat here again if nearby, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here.",

I've been to the Centennial location about 3 times and in those times, I thought that the food was just okay with less than average service.  This time and at the location near Summerlin, I had a different experience.  First of all, the service is completely different here.  From start to finish, I thought that the servers and check out was easy as can be.  As for the food, I decided on trying something different since I wasn't a huge fan of their skillets in the past.  This time I decided on their Cracked Croissant.  This is their breakfast sandwich that consist of a huge buttery croissant, eggs your way, choice of cheese, and choice of meat.  I had this with turkey bacon and let me tell you, this meal way to start the day.  My croissant was so big that I ate it with a knife and a fork (my favorite utensil).  The sandwich was buttery, tasty, and even had enough macros to satisfy my daily needs. Trust me...unsure of what to get here?  At $10.95 with hash browns, try their Cracked Croissant.    PS:  Only issue was with their hash browns.  I wanted it cooked extra crispy.  They dropped the ball on this one, but my croissant more than made up for it.",

I got the hash browns.  - I guess I was expecting something better than Wicked Spoon's Egg benedict. - Tasted good, but not great. Enjoyed the gravy, but I think it made it all gooey. But I guess that's the country style.  - Better with hot sauce!  - This place is a good alternative if you don't feel like going to Babystacks or HashHouse.",

Normally, this restaurant serves nice sized portions and my salads will last me for four separate occasions. Neither salad was like that today, and when I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, I was told he saw the salads being made and that \"from now on they will measure the lettuce\" to prevent this from happening again. I spent almost 30 dollars on 2 salads and the one time in years my order was not what it should have been, the manager brushes it off and even says he saw that his employee did not make sure the salads were up to standards. I am truly disappointed with the way this situation was handled and hope that this does not happen to another customer.",

I ordered the Tropical French toast, two pieces of bread dipped in egg, coated with some toasted coconut and macadamia nuts, and nicely grilled.    I sat at the counter and the place was quite busy.  Maybe it just seemed that way because no one was eating outside because it was RAINING!    Service was very quick and everyone was pleasant and had a nice smile.  I only had one cup of coffee but I was asked about a refill.  I was giving platelets later and I didn't want to be sitting the hour and a half in the chair when the coffee want to leave me.  Also, thanks to the restaurant for having a half order as an option.  That was just enough!  One thing that would really make this breakfast tropical would be to replace the maple syrup with coconut syrup.  Now that's tropical!",

And it was amazing. We all ordered different things and it was all excellent!!   So the bottom line is, the food is awesome, the service is top notch and the prices were very reasonable.

If you are looking for a good meal with decent prices and you just need to fill your belly and go, this place will work fine for you.  If you want to enjoy your breakfast, speak with your significant other and just chill, don't bother.  We felt rushed and there was just way too much noise.  There is a patio outside in the strip mall.  I do not know if they will give you table service outdoors though.  We never asked, but if it's not too hot, that could be a good option to avoid the noise.",

    "text": "We drove all the way out here to try Babycakes not knowing they'd have an excruciatingly long line, so we turned to Yelp to find something nearby that would satisfy our breakfast needs.  Up popped Cracked Egg.  We were already in the area anyways, and reading all the great reviews, we decided to head on down.    Much shorter wait ... about 5 minutes.  Still nice and busy.  Kind of a random strip mall to be located in - almost industrial looking ... but then again, considering it seemed most of the restaurants outside the strip seemed to be in this kind of environment, I think that's just how Vegas rolls?   Ambiance inside was nice, however, and the servers were super sweet and helpful.  The three of us girls were starving so after a thorough gander through the menu, my friend ordered the Veggie Benny (Vegetarian Benedict since she hates Canadian bacon), I ordered the Country Benny (because my fat arse really wanted some gravy), and my other friend ordered the Croissant French Toast.  Got to choose from either hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  My friend asked the server if they made their own hash browns or if they came from the frozen industrial stuff.  Unfortunately it came from the frozen variety, so we opted for the seasoned potatoes.  Luckily, the seasoned potatoes are delicious - so no sacrifice there!  We also ordered ourselves some orange juice and coffee.  Came with your typical diner - accompaniments (half & half creamers and sugar).  Considering all the crap that's in that weird half & half, we decided to ask her for some milk, instead, and luckily, she was super cool about it :)    My country benny was very good...super fulfilling, too.  Wish the gravy were just a tad more flavorful - it was a bit bland for country-style gravy, but hey..I'm a gravy sucka and as long as it was smothered on my biscuit and sausage, I was still a happy girl.  All in all, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to eat here again, but would definitely not be against it if we happened to find ourselves out round these parts.",
