    "text": "Buffets... again. I think my mom would love the buffets in Las Vegas (especially if you buy the Total Rewards deal, you pay about $57, for a 24 hour buffet-eating spree)  But buffets and hangover do not blend very well. I was a bit miserable buffet-hopping in the day time. It sucks many of the mom n pop pho shops or dim sum restaurants are not located on the strip. It is taken over by the bigger businesses owned by the hotels, otherwise they would have great business. We started off at Le Village at noon, the line was a bit long for a 3-star buffet. I would expect Wynn or Bellagio would be ridiculous, but  nevertheless it went by quick, especially if you have large parties. There is a service/gratuity charge if your party exceeds 7. There were 7 of us so we made the cut! (huzzah!)  Since it is located in the Paris Hotel, many food were French inspired like French toast, crepes, Eggs Benedict. I tried to make the most of my buck, but buffets and I don't get along since I eat very little portions. We chose the buffet-hop for the experience since some of my friends really wanted to try as many buffets as possible. There is an extra $15 charge if you buy the Total Rewards deal and eat at Caesars'. I recommend coming here hangover free, starved, and with some big pants.    It's a good experience--but not for me. I just stick with the simple ole' fast food and maybe one buffet for dinner.",

Overall, not a bad meal after three days of losing hundreds of dollars, but if you want quality and options, this is not your place.    The food is ok, like I said, for a groupon deal of $18 it's not bad, but would I pay more for this place, no way.  I think it's $24 for lunch w/o the groupon.  Quality of the food was bleak, as the selection was.  I don't remember seeing a seafood bar but that may be b/c I was dining at lunch time.   The line was long, but it moves pretty fast.    Heh, save your money and hit up one of the fancier buffets..........",

The lines are very long which I don't mind but only if it's worth it (we waited for 45 mins). The decor is highly outdated, probably haven't renovated in over 10+ years since it has this dungeon feel.  The staff is stretched thin as I can see they are overworked.  The waitress didn't give us drinks until we flagged her, when we ordered hot tea she gave us very watered down milk which was a complete turnoff. We were missing spoons and napkins such I'm sure it's due to the waitress running around covering such a huge section.  The variety of food is very very poor. I can't even explain.  Their vegetarian option is horrible and there really isn't much to choose from.  I would stay the hell away from here for dinner.  I had a  decent breakfast from here a while ago,  but the dinner experience has turned me off forever.  Do yourself a favor and go to Aria for a dinner buffet instead.",

For a 'French' dining experience, it makes me never really want to visit France! The best thing I had was the Yukon gold mashed potatoes and the creme brulee was ok (that is my favorite dessert so I was glad that at least tasted decent!)",

The hotel itself and rooms are great, but the buffet may have taken my money for the last time this last visit. I don't know why i keep coming back here always giving them the benefit of the doubt. But this last visit did it for me, im done with Le Village Buffet at Paris. With so many other hotels having great Buffets (eg: Aria, Bellagio, Wynn and even Rio still going strong) their are too many choices too be a sub par buffet especially in Las Vegas.  Honorable Mention: Go elsewhere! (unless it's a comp than maybe)",

    "text": "If you're looking for a buffet on the Strip that offers a difference experience (in both food and presentation) from ordinary buffets, definitely try the buffet at Paris.  This buffet is a great reminder of what can be great about Vegas; dining in Le Village will immerse you into the feel and charm of eating in a nice village in France. From the setting to the waiters, and of course the food, the ambiance certainly sets Le Village apart from other contemporary buffets.  But the food. That's what we came here for right? And believe me, it won't disappoint. Beyond offering some of the more traditional stuff you'll see at every buffet, Le Village has French-influenced food (surprise surprise) which was a big hit for me. I definitely loved the selection and was able to try different things. And perhaps the best part of it all is that there's a crepe station to fulfill all your sweet-tooth desire. But be forewarned, the crepe line can get mighty long, so if there's an opening, it might be smart to grab one real fast.   Overall, I've been here on a couple occasions and I had a stellar experience each time. Definitely recommending Le Village if you're looking for a buffet that's not at the Wynn or Caesar's.",

Workers and cooks didn't seem happy, especially our server who rarely came by to clean our table and refill drinks.  Food was the biggest disappointment. Nothing tasted amazing to me, and usually I like at least one entree at a buffet. BUTTTTT... the crepe station is worth it. I ordered my absolute favorite - NUTELLA AND BANANA. Freshly made! Unfortunately, there was only one cook, which made a \"short\" line more like 20 minutes. Food was salty and DRY. Wasn't impressed. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to buffets, too...  In short, it's hard to swallow (literally) $64 for two. I'd rather spend that money at Mon Ami across the way, one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I normally do not care for buffets, even the concept bothers me a little.  With that said, Natasha and I managed to find what I consider to be perhaps the best buffet in Vegas replete with many notable French classics.    The selection was especially large, and I was very pleased to see favorites like cassoulet, coq au vin, boeuf bourguignon, and so forth.  Each of these particular dishes was decidedly good, and the selection by no means ended there.  I had a cheese course, creme brulee, carrot cake, and, well, a handful of plates by the time everything was said and done.  Apparently, I am a glutton for the classics.    The wait in line is a notable drawback to coming here though.  We showed up for a late lunch, but by the time we paid and we were seated, it was actually an early dinner.  I would estimate we waited a good 40 minutes, but the timing was such that we saved $14 between the different prices and were afforded an even grander selection of proteins.  So who is really going to complain about that?  Aesthetically everything was pleasing, and we managed to have a grand time here.  Highly recommend.",

Unfortunately, all the other food was pretty disappointing. Even the creme brule was okay.  The best thing has got to be the crepe making station. There was a lady making crepes with the desired fruit topping you want. The lady unfortunately messed up my order and gave me cherries instead of strawberries. So, I had a blueberry, cherries, and banana crepe topped with powdered sugar and nutella. It was pretty good.   The potatoes were really old and soggy. The vegetables that I got were  not fresh at all. I compared this buffet to the one at Planet Hollywood and I have to say that the buffet at Planet Hollywood was better, even though it does not have all the french stuff that this buffet has.",

The fish (surprisingly NOT in oil) was so hard my fork couldn't even penetrate the meat. The buffet was slammed packed and I saw them constantly bringing out new food, but that was just as bad as the old stuff. A lot of it looked like it was made ealy in the morning and then stored under a heat lamp until dinner time.  GOOD: The prime rib was surprisingly good (the horseradish not so much) and the crepes were really good.   If you get dragged there stick to the savory and sweet crepes. The rest is a disappointment.

    "text": "Where to begin?  How about at the beginning.  The organization of the seating/line situation is abhorrent.  It took half an hour for about 25 people to be processed and seated.  There are two problems with solutions right there.    One: Suggest to customers buying the 24 hour dining pass (great deal, by the way) that for an upcharge they can bypass the line so as to avoid the lengthier processing line since all they have to do is get scanned.  You make money, we don't get stressed before a meal.  This is a \"french\" restaurant, right?  The stress should be in the back of the house.  Two: Maybe have, oh, I don't know, a HOSTESS to seat and a SERVER to fill drinks?  Or have a soda/juice/coffee station for customers to get themselves beverages?  If you trust people to carry their own plates, why not trust them to carry their own cups?  Having a willy-nilly seating arrangement with three or four ladies to seat guests and immediately get them their drinks makes absolutely no sense at all.    One more thing in terms of running this shin-dig, and this is not a problem with just Le Village Buffet alone.  WHY.  WHY is breakfast served until 11?  WHY?  This is Vegas, right?  Famous for late nights and breakfast buffets.  So, tell me why you encourage guests to stay up late gambling and then do not reward them for their hard work by allowing them to sleep and get up for a lovely brunch?  Obviously, you should not stop serving breakfast, but perhaps should begin to add lunch items around noon and phase out things like omelets and bacon around that time too.  11 is unacceptable.  What is this, prison?  And another thing!  What is going ON back there?  With a French theme, I would expect some technically superior food.  Come on, chief!  What are y'all DOing back there?  Southern style corned beef hash, biscuits with gravy, stale bread (bread, of all things!) limp, overcooked pasta, uninspired eggs benedict wherein someone lost control of their hot sauce holding hand, and finally, crepes that were far, FAR too thick.  Wait, also the desserts were badly executed.  Creme brulees were torched like nine hours ago and did not crunch but the custard was good. No finesse, no sense of intention or dedication or grace or communication.  I tasted confusion and lack of organization.  The complete opposite of what I expect from a True french cook.  The best thing there besides the salad bar was the quiche, and I suspect it came frozen out of a package.  Get. It. Together. Chief.  Seriously.   And management.  Where is your business sense?

They have basic to moderate ingredients that makes starting the day with a nutella, banana, and bacon crepe simply great.   If sweet breakfast is not your thing then try hitting up the savory brunch options. In the hour between breakfast and lunch they start to bring out lunch options which is an added bonus if you're looking for more savory dishes.   If there is still room for dessert try one of each of the pastries. You're in Vegas you have to live a little.   The service is a mixed bag at times but overall it's a fun time.   Fun note: Even though you're in the \"Paris\" Casino you will not find anyone in the Le Villiage Buffet that speaks French. Using my Spanish has gotten me better service and food options.",

It's nice for a person not expecting much but basic options and some crepes but if you expect more, skip Paris. It was well after 2 and they still had breakfast options when Brunch was scheduled for the day. They also didn't pay much attention to restocking empty food dishes. I'm also a little peeved that they assembled the macaroons top to bottom instead of bottom to bottom. I mean it may seem small and insignificant but it IS a Paris themed restaurant, right...  I think the buffet of buffet pass is a great option but I'd rather pay a little more than to have these staple locations decline in options and service.",

The ambiance is pretty & cozy. It reminds me of the set of Beauty & The Beast (which is probably another reason why I like this place so much).  For brunch, they have a wide selection of breakfast items along with lunch/dinner items such as crab legs & prime rib. I love how they have a crepe station (although there's typically a line), and they serve endless mimosas.  Servers can be hit & miss, but typically, our servers have been good. The managers are super awesome tho, & they always make sure we're well taken care of.  Downside, woman's bathroom only has 1 stall for the entire buffet. I'm not sure why they planned it this way as there's always a line in the ladies bathroom.  Other than that, food is worth the price & I always leave this place happy & fully stuffed!",

First off, this place is located in one of the paris themed hotels, so as you are walking to get here, you pass all these stores and pastries shops that are look like the buildings in Paris. There can be a long line to get in, which there was when we went, but the line moved so quick. I think we waited maybe 5 - 10 minutes. Once we got our table we went straight to the buffet. OMG everything was amazing! The make your own omelette station was my personal fave. I am so picky with omelettes and the guy who made mine did so good! They have an assortment of typical breakfast food like eggs, bacon, sausage then they have a straight breakfast pastry section on their buffet and everything was so fresh! I was so please. When my husband and I decide to come back, we will be come back here for sure!",

    "text": "I went to Le Village buffet on Sunday May 1st 2016, I arrived at the buffet shortly before closing time where I was made aware by the hostess that I would only have 45 minutes to eat. I find it to be extremely frustrating that they rushed me for my $31.99 buffet. I should have had an unlimited amount of time if not atleast an hour. How are you supposed to enjoy everything a buffet has to offer in 45 minutes? Ridiculous.  I quickly began getting as much food at the buffet to ensure that I could try everything there was to offer. I was extremely dismayed whenever I realized that the dinner rolls were not kept in warmers nor was their honey butter. The dinner rolls we're terrible quality I've had much better dinner rolls at Ryan's Buffet or Golden Coral Buffet which are both about $20 cheaper.   Another item that I tried was the sirloin steak. The steaks were terrible quality, did not taste good at all and for a $30 buffet you couldn't even order a steak medium rare they were all well done. While chewing the steak I tried to gather what the taste reminded me of and I soon realized that it tasted like a hot dog. I was not pleased with the quality of steak nor was I pleased with the quality of prime rib.   Whenever it got time for dessert I was really excited because I had been saving room to ensure that I would be able to try everything on the dessert section of the buffet. I love bread pudding and it is always one of my go-tos at buffets and the bread pudding at Le Village buffet was not good at all. I've had much better at every other buffet I've visited and I've been to a lot of buffets.   I would say that the mashed potatoes and gratin potatoes along with macaroni and cheese along with alfredo pasta was good, yes I tried them all. They still did not make up for the price point and had me in the bathroom thirty minutes later.  As an avid buffet eater I've learned before purchasing buffet to ask the hostess if I can take a look at whats out. I normally do this whenever I visit a new buffet, but I did not do that this time, I wish I would have because it would have saved me money because i wouldnt have gotten the buffet.",

It was obvious enough that I noticed it even before anything else happened. When seated, our table already had two pitchers on it, one I assumed was coffee and one with tea. My husband went to the crepe stand and I started to try to pour my coffee. I noticed that only a tiny trickle would come out into my cup. I tried to unscrew the lid of the pitcher  so that more coffee could come out easier- a totally normal thing to do. Galo rushed to my table and literally ripped the pitcher out of my hands saying \"No No No!!!\" I just stared at him, not understanding what was going on. He looked at me angrily and said, \"OK you want coffee, what else do you want?!?\" I was so startled and I said well I guess water and I know my husband will want juice. He walked away but while he was less than a full table away, he said \"please...!\" In a tone of voice that told me he was annoyed that I hadn't said it.  I don't appreciate it. That meal was expensive and I don't deserve to be treated like that for absolutely no reason. Why did Paris sit us at a table with a used up carafe of coffee? Gross. Why did this man pull it out of my hands??  Why give me intense attitude when I answered his question politely? Not cool. While I love the food here, I can't afford to pay to be treated so poorly. There are other options.",

The food was fresh, the service was friendly, and there was a good variety of foods.  This buffet has a unique structure - it has different stations corresponding with different regions / themes in France, which I thought was pretty cool.    I especially liked the omelette bar and was not disappointed with my savory pesto omelette.   I also really liked their fresh salad bar, which had some excellent options.  Their steak was also delicious.   What I was actually pretty disappointed in was their dessert section. I mean, c'mon, this is Paris right?  I was expecting some amazing pastries, but they came up short and mostly just had macarons (which I don't eat).  Other than that, I have no complaints about the food.  The wait in line was a bit annoying, but you can find some amazing deals through GroupOn, so check it out.  The three of us got in for the price of 2.",

Let's start with cleanliness and service... 1. My cup of water was so dirty. There were white things all over the inside.  2. Lipstick on my napkin 3. I couldn't find the French cheese section so I asked the person in charge on the station and he told me \"I don't know. I just got here?\" And then after he figured it out, he showed me a bucket of shredded cheese.   Now food. 1. Soup station was messy and cold 2. This is a French buffet without warm baguette bread.  3. There was a random sushi station.  4. They got rid of their cheese platter and cold cuts.   I guess I also expected more considering it was New Years and we paid holiday price.",

We had a misfortune of going there for dinner on Thanksgiving. Big mistake . We only went because my mother in law really wanted to go . We were in line from 6:30 pm to 8:40 pm. Over 2 hours to eat the mediocre overpriced fare. They had a very limited selection of food, tiny shrimp and super salty low quality crab legs . Their great desserts were not so great either , no eclairs and just a few variations. This buffet should coat no more than 15.99 a person and certainly not 40.00 Never again.",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of buffets at all, but decided to join friends to Paris' buffet. Heard it was good for brunch, but we got there for lunch on a Friday. Before noon, the line was fairly long, but it went by pretty quickly. If you have a Total Rewards card, you get $1 off, which equals to about $20 a person.   We were seated in the back, and our drink orders were taken. Sodas, juices, and coffee is unlimited. The buffet area does look very Disneyland-esque as others had mentioned. Selections varied from salads, meats, French inspired food, and of course, the crepe station.   Was really dissapointed that there wasn't a vast array of cheeses and breads as I had expected, although towards the end of our stay, they did put out some cheeses, but they were very typical kinds. Most of their food was not flavorful, and choices were limited. My favorite was the ham and cheese quiche, but it was comparable to the frozen ones you can find at Costco. Saved room for the crepes, and they have about 4 sweet choices and 4 savory. The line is usually long and we waited about 20 minutes. Luckily you can choose up to 2, and they make it really quick.   I seemed to have gotten the crepe maker that didn't really care as I could see him burning the crepes and not paying attention. My sweet crepe had candied walnuts, and my savory had spinach, mushrooms, etc. Can't remember all the ingredients, and he must've forgotten as instead of bechamel, he poured powdered sugar all over the top and had to make it all over again. Both were not memorable at all.   Overall, we all agreed this place is whatevers, and wouldn't return.",

I had some eggs Benedict and even a small omelette (the guy making the omelettes was awesome) plus lots of sides and fruit and it was all really good.  We even loaded up on desserts (we took some out with us so don't tell anybody) and they were all really good too.

The buffet's dining room has seen better days (it's a tad bit too dark but still has those cool Parisian details). The staff were very nice, but the food was nothing to write home about. This buffet is def not in the same tier as the upper echelon of Vegas buffets. It's about the same price as the upper tier buffets, but gives you mid tier quality. For example, there's no ice cream/gelato at the dessert station. Most of the upper end buffets also have live cooking stations so food is fresher. Paris had the usual cooked food under heat lamps. For the price, I would recommend going to Bellagio, Aria, Cosmo, or spending a little bit more and going to Caesars or Wynn.",

I came for breakfast with my boyfriend and within the last hour, the power went out in Paris while we were in line. At first we were like okay, that's weird. The hostess in front stated that has never happened before. Within minutes, power came back off then turned off again. This kept happening more than a handful of times while we were waiting in line still. We finally got seated, and mind you, the power kept going on and on when we were getting food and eating. Everyone had their phones out using their light to eat and walk around. Had only one plate of food, the food was cold, and they couldn't make food because the gas was out. And I am so disappointed because all I wanted were the crepes because I kept bragging about it..   I know it isn't the casino's fault but the reason behind me giving them two stars is because management and staff didn't acknowledge the problem. With it being a major issue like that, you would at least think they would apologize for the inconvenience to their paying guests and explain the situation, which they didn't. Please work on your management and staff if any problems occur like this one.",

The food was good, better than a typical buffet. They had seven different stations of food including a ham carving station which you don't typically see for breakfast. It was very good.

I waited in line about 20 minutes for dinner and around 2 minutes for breakfast so please be aware the waiting times do vary.  The food in my opinion for dinner is definitely top 5 for Vegas buffets, large selection of meats (Prime Rib, Roast, Sausages, Chicken, Pork, Duck, Lamb) fish (Shrimp, Crab legs, Mussels, Clams, salmon) and a variety of french dishes and pasta.  Please be aware the this place gets packed on weekends and holidays, so wait times for drinks etc. can be lengthy, the staff was very helpful and courteous during my meal.  For Breakfast they pretty much cover everything under the sun as well, it opens at 7am so if you get there around 8am, you should be okay.  There wasn't as large of a selection of fresh fruits as I would like for a breakfast buffet, but the rest of the items made up for it.  Definitely try a cut of bacon with your eggs, they have the normal type bacon, but where the prime rib cutting station is, they have a huge slab of bacon, freshly cut and thick.  I would definitely recommend this buffet.",

We did the 24-hour buffet of buffets and we liked the food here so much we came here for lunch AND brunch.  I don't understand people's complaints about lack of selection... how much food do you need?!? They had pretty much every kind of protein (fish, beef, pork, shellfish) and several different types of starches and vegetables.  Personally, I loved the Brussels sprouts.  My favorite - by FAR - was the omelette station.  Yummy!! The crepe station was pretty great, too.  My husband loved the crab legs.  The unlimited mimosas for brunch was a nice added bonus.  All the food was really flavorful...none of that bland other crap we had at some other buffets.  While a little corny and \"Disney-ish\", I actually really enjoyed sitting in the little village that they created inside Paris.  It was cute.  There was a line for the buffet, but not as long as at some of the other buffets we saw (like Caesar's) and it moved fairly well.  I think we stood in line for 20 minutes, which for a Saturday at 10:00am really wasn't bad.  There was no line at all when we came for lunch on Friday.  I would highly recommend this buffet!!",

    "text": "- Good buffet from the Buffet of the Buffets list, I enjoyed that.  I wish I did go for dinner though instead of lunch.  The mimosas did hit the stop for early afternoon- Loved it. Breakfast food is what sold me here.    -  The french toast was really good too, two different types of sausage there-tasted excellent as well.  I sampled a bit of everything and like I said, it was nice to finally eat some BREAKFAST food, compared to any other meals that me and the group had been eating lately.  Since I had this deal for 24 hours of buffets, this was a place to try, NO COMPLAINTS HERE.  Loved the fresh fruits and the pasta was even good too.  LUNCH buffet is normally $20 plus tax,  It is maybe somewhere I would not come again but nice to go even at least this one time.  I loaded up on bacon and potatoes on my plate as well, hash browns were money also to eat.  Check this one out, especially if you have this deal.",

    "text": "Definitely not the most fantastic buffet I have been to in Vegas, but it did the trick on a Sunday afternoon with some buddies and a Groupon. $45 for 2 to eat with all you can drink adult beverages. That was a great thing.. but the buffet itself left alot to be desired.   The layout of the space is so clumsy and awkward that you are shoved into back corners of the place.. we actually had a table IN THE WALKWAY of the back room we were seated in. It's not so comfortable. On top of it all, there was no selection of 'Asian-Style' food.. no sweet and sour, no tempura anything.. and really not alot of selection overall.   The main thing that saved this dining experience is that they have a crepe counter. Both savory and sweet crepes.. they are a great addition to the pretty weak selection. I say give it a try for that reason, and if you can get a deal. Happy Eating!",

The other two reminded me of eating at an old country buffet or a Denny's. But Paris made you feel like you were in France.  The food was fantastic! We had the afternoon brunch and enjoyed made-to-order crepes, creme brulee that was out of this world, and a couple pastas that were very good. We didn't get it, but you could get all-you-can-drink mimosas for $12 per person. And right now there is a Groupon 2 for one and a bottle of wine included for $30ish.    We loved eating at Paris, would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "After the debacle at Excalibur's buffet, this one was a welcome change. The eggs managed to stay moist even as they were switching over to lunch fare. I suspect the use of cream of some variety. The mini Eggs Benedict impressed me the most. I figured if it had been sitting out a while, the egg would have been seriously overcooked. Again, not sure how they pulled it off, but the egg was still runny. Well done. I also sampled chocolate croissants, mini pancakes, and a macaroon of some variety.  The only annoying thing was they didn't let you get your own drinks. I was literally chewing ice waiting for another round because I was so thirsty. For reference, I hate ice in my drinks, much less chewing on it. We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated, though the drinks took much longer to come out.  The decorations were fun. It did feel like you were sitting in a cafe somewhere in Paris enjoying a meal.",

Perhaps it's the \"buffet theory.\"  What's that, you ask?  Well my theory is that buffets, even the best ones, might have a few stellar menu items, but overall everything is mediocre or just whatevs.  This wasn't my first time at the Le Village buffet, but each time I go, nothing really wows me.  I'm not saying that it's bad.  Eggs were eggs.  Sausages. Waffles.  Typical stuff. The only thing that stood out was that they offered to bring our made-to-order omelettes to the table so that we don't have to wait in line.  That was cool.  Ambiance is nice.  Looks like you're eating outside in a small French village.   I would go back, but of all the places to eat in Vegas, this is not in my \"must eats.\"",

Doesn't have that metallic or plastic taste like if it came from the bottom of a freezer.  The pasta with truffle sauce was absolutely amazing.  For me, of course, the drawback was the price but I personally like spending no more than $20 for an amazing lunch meal.  The other drawback were the crepes.  Now the dessert ones are great, from what I heard.  The meal crepes, however, can use some improving.  The chef asked me to wait a little longer for the cheese to melt inside the crepe which I thought was totally fine.  However upon indulgence, the cheese was not warm and not fully melted either.  Think of putting sliced cheese in the microwave then having someone cut the time short because everyone is in a hurry.  Yea, that kind of cheese consistency. Overall it's not too bad, but like I said I'm not a buffet kind of guy, but this did exceed my expectations.",

Desserts weren't anything special either. I suggest you get a savory crepe and leave some room for a sweet crepe! That's all you need. Our waitress was an older lady who kept forgetting to get us what we asked for or she would not acknowledge us when we called out for her. She is older so I don't want to bash her or anything, but I'd suggest management to really crack down on their employees and remind them the importance of customer service after all you are in the service industry. It's what is expected from your customers. The buffet itself feels a little outdated, but it does lean on the cheaper side in comparison to the others. I still prefer Bacchanal above all or Rio's seafood buffet.",

Definitely something I hadn't seen before. But unfortunately, that's one of the only thing that impressed me.   They had the usual buffet stuff: sushi, shrimp, pasta, pork, turkey, prime rib, roast beef, mac and cheese, assorted vegetables, mussels, rice, etc. But nothing I put on my plate was warm when I got back to the table. I ended up eating room temperature meat and vegetables which was quite a disappointment. When we got around to dessert, the macroos and eclairs were so hard you needed a knife to cut thru them. The only thing I truly savored was the huge banana and Nutella crepe I got.  I guess all in all, I can chalk it up to another experience, but not one I'd care to repeat. This wasn't the worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas, but it's definitely not one I plan to return to since there are so many other better options around.",

My two favorite things where the french toast made with good thick bread and smoked trout.  Overall, they had a lot of decent breakfast options but I would prefer to go to a normal sit down restaurant. The large number of options doesn't offset the mediocre food.",

They were out of bananas for the banana nutella crepes.  The cook said the bananas they delivered were green and couldn't be used.  Fast food would have been more satisfying!",

The unique regions aren't unique and food is no better than a coffee shop. No nice rotisserie meat area as that is where the new self serve drink station is. The price for 2 seniors was over $70. Thank goodness for all you can drink beer and wine  for  $13. The only thing really authentic is the crepe station, maybe. Haven't had it yet. Oh yes and NO waitresses! Wow!

I asked her for another piece of prime ribs (because the 1st piece was too small) and she gave me a very dirty look. I got in at 8:30 pm, and around 9:00, most of the foods are gone and they started to clean up. By the time I finished the main course (around 9:15 pm), most of the desserts are gone (only a couple cake left). I was very disappointed with the foods and the services. The whole time I was there, the server only stopped by my table 2 times. It's a waste of $36.99 for a Sunday Dinner Buffet. PLEASE DON'T EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!",

The line, even when \"short\", moves excruciatingly slow. I waited an hour to be seated after going inside the entrance. You may show up for breakfast, but by the time you get inside, they may have changed over to lunch. The crepe station is, in my opinion, what makes this buffet worth coming to. However, if a crepe is the main thing you're looking for, there is La Creperie just across the walkway, which is probably a better choice. The service was good, and the food was enjoyable. But, waiting that long to get seated is a challenge.",

Yes, some are better and some are worse, but this buffet falls right in the middle between a must visit and a completely avoid. It's also included in theTotal Rewards Buffet of Buffets, which is a great deal especially if you go to a buffet you don't like because you can just leave and go to another without paying an extra fee.  There is a wide selection at this buffet, like at most buffet's. Its a french theme so even though there is a lot to choose from, there isn't a huge variety like you would get at the Planet Hollywood buffet.   Everything to eat here is decent and really depends on your palate and how the food is prepared that day. The menu of what they serve here hasn't changed in the last four years so they'll probably stick to what they have. Most things to eat are a serious hit or miss and the only real consistent thing I've had are the pastas, which are totally not good for you but really tasty in my opinion. My brother got food poisoning from the crab legs here so I would stay away from them. But honestly it's kind of a rule of thumb that you shouldn't eat shellfish from a buffet anyway.  The desserts here are a complete miss in my opinion. It's a French themed buffet and the macarons are different colors and only come in two flavors which are underwhelming to say the least. Another downside to this place is that there's only one stall in the bathroom so good luck to anyone who has to go during a busy time of day.",

One thing that really stood out from my experience here was my server. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name but it's an older Filipino gentlemen. He was so sweet and made my time here enjoyable.  He came back often to check on me and my the rest of my party, and made sure we had drinks and our tables were cleared.   He was so great! If you ever read this, thank you!",

I'd stay, (not at Paris tho) but I'd be very careful what I eat. I gained platinum in a short time so ya I gamble. And my prize was a free buffet. Wowee. Yuck.   You know that scene in Vegas vacation where they go to that rank buffet? I felt like this. The crepes were ok. Barely. Probably only edible thing. I had the ultimate nerve to ask a woman near crab legs if they could heat them. She yelled ONLY FOR 7 STARS!! (Picture the soup nazi screaming). Wow. Really?  So I actually had my first ever experience with spitting out a dessert. I love my sugar but the flan gagged me. And I'm Texan. We love our flan. This was rotten. Horrible. None of the meat was good. I ate a small salad. Hard to mess that up.   Macaroons. Ok those were exceptional. We were starving and ate like 5 each.   I would not eat here again if it were free. And it was. It is that nasty. Oh and we not once got a single refill on our iced teas. Hubby dropped a fork and we had to get a new one because no one ever bothered to check on us. Avoid.   Ohhh one more thing. We had to walk all the way there and were sent back to TR desk to get the voucher for or fabulous dinner. They accused us of already using it. Lol. We had eaten a 250$ dinner about 40 hrs earlier at BLT. Received the offer about 10pm from TR desk. Was told had to use with in 48 hours. At TR desk poor girl had to beg front desk manager to allow us to use this. He said 48 hrs starts at 6am even thought we got it at 10pm. Please explain that to normal people haha. It was 36 to 49 hrs from time we got it. Who said 6am?  It sounded made up. Then manager of TR desk said \"I show you used this at 10 pm night before last\" um we had just eaten a 5 course meal at an upscale steak house at 8pm. I can most assuredly say we did not turn around and eat at a buffet in another CET resort. Oink oink.   Very argumentative and very unprofessional. Balding guy. Wouldn't get up from behind this small little window cut out of an office. I felt sorry for his worker who was really sweet. Because of this I will never stay at Paris. I liked Ballys and they seemed proficient. But Paris as a whole really turned us off 100%. I take pics usually. But didn't waste my camera space.",

We would have been better off just getting crepes at Blizz in the Bally's mall next door for dessert and getting In and Out at the Promenade at the Linq.  We stayed at Treasure Island and went to their buffet.  Food was much better, key is they followed the Keep it Simple rule which worked",

Those days are gone and it's evident by the none existent line that once would wrap out the door. It's been going done in quality for several years but now it has hit  rock bottom. The selection of food is half what it used to be. The meat station was OK. The crepes station was good. The macaroons were good as well. Can't say anything good about anything else there. The quality was low and the selection was minimal. You don't have to take my word for it. The good buffets have long lines. This one has no lines now, but still costs the same as when they had quality food.",

    "text": "Food was good, service was great.  Le Village Buffet is located in the Paris Hotel, but it can be accessed from Bally's through a tunnel passage between the two hotels.   The line was long on a Tuesday at 10 am. I went to ask one of the staff members if I could move my mom (who's in a wheelchair) close to the entrance instead of lining up. She told me to go to the VIP line next door (VIPs had their own entrance, Woo Hoo). Instead of waiting over an hour, we were seated within 5 minutes =)  Because we were seated pass 10 am I paid the breakfast price ($25 each) for my group but was still there for the meal change to lunch at 11 am. Bonus!! Got to try both breakfast and lunch dishes. Yes!  The highlights for me: Omelette station - custom made. Yum.  Tip: you can also ask them to cook eggs only (sunny side up, over easy, etc etc)   Mussel stew - plump and juicy. Yum.   Clams w/ sausage & basil - my favorite dish of the meal. Great broth and tender clams. Yum!   Lemon meringue & Creme brulee for dessert was delicious!!  Everything else I tried was just okay.  French toast  Shrimp cocktail - not deveined  Smoked salmon  Andouille sausage  Corned beef hash - canned? Soups.   Service for our table was good. Refills and empty plates were handled efficiently.  The lady who told me to go to the VIP line came over to make sure my mom was okay and that I really appreciated.   The food was good. But the service and kindness shown to my mom, I will not forget. I'll definitely be back.",

We came here for Friday lunch and first of all they charged us full price without even asking if we had players card. Then there was nothing to eat and the prime rib was just ok and for the other meat dishes the meat was so tough i had a hard time putting my knife through it. I was still hopeful for the ready made crepes but they failed to satisfy. The berry crepe was wayyy too sweet and the savory crepe was just so-so. Even the bread wasn't so good- I mean i've had better bread from my local supermarket. The one thing better than the M resort was the creme bru le but it wasn't amazing or anything :/ Overall the food was very disappointing and our waitress was nowhere to be seen for most of the time.",

It was pretty busy and they were opening up new sections for us to sit.  Our cashier was a gentlemen that wasn't too friendly and when we were first seated it took a long time for a waitress to come get our drink orders.  We had the unlimited drinks which is cool, but limited in what you can order.  They did have mimosas, bloody mary's, miller lite, and red and white wine.  Most of the food is French inspired since you are at the Paris and they have that whole theme going but there were a few other buffet staples as well.  They had good crepes, a nice salad and dessert bar, a lot of seafood dishes, chilled crab legs, shrimp cocktail, and decent pasta dishes.  I'm so tired of sub par pasta thrown together with some random salty sauce and that wasn't the case here.  You could actually watch the lady making the pasta dishes while going through the line.  The creme brulee was very good too.  Food was pretty good, especially for the price.  I would try this buffet again.",

Some of Yelp reviews were correct-especially about sushi- the rice was dry and none of us even swallowed the first piece of sushi.For some reason, some stations were empty in spite of the fact that it was Saturday night. No deserts at all !-to our biggest surprise. Except for the crepes -they were OK,namely the filling was OK,but the wrap tasted bad-could not eat it. Usually, the crepes should be soft , but this made-to order crepes did not meet my expectations. I make better crepes, though do not like to do them frequently.It's such a time-consuming hassle. There was no duck,per se. But salmon was wonderfully prepared,as well as the noodles or macaroni. The only thing that brightened my day was our waiter -Donato. Oh,my Gosh ! I would wish to have the guy at any restaurant I go! We had an excellent service rendered by him. I got a plate of small crabs,and did not touch them yet,was busy with another plate.Donato approached me and said:\"You won't eat these crabs!\" He took the plate away,and in a few minutes he came back with a big basket and 2 plates.The basket was full of freshly made,hot,succulent crabs. He made sure that our tea was hot. At the end, Donato presented us with black and white chocolates in the form of Eiffel tower ! Good job, Donato!",

The duck, which was a highlight for me, was overcooked and positively reheated.  It was so dry and tasted so awful that we asked to talk to the chef, who was very nice and apologetic.  Of course, he has to work with what he is given to prepare, but blech!  Their \"macaroons,\" are not that but are \"macarons,\" which I usually enjoy.  They were also dry and tasteless.The wine was absolutely undrinkable. The place was also pretty empty of customers - no surprise there.  Le Village needs a serious makeover in every way.  Skip it.",

For the $40 basic cost, with tax and tip, the food was up to par.  For that price I don't expect to have the diversity of top end French recipes.  What I don't understand is how you can have a French buffet and NOT serve Beef Bourguignon.  Almost all the ingredients are there in various locations (mushrooms, bacon, beef, soup), you just need to add some burgundy wine,  and pearl onions and cook it down.  You don't need to use a fine Rothschild wine!!  The cranberry rolls that were available at the time were very hard, but still tasty.  The other item I would change is to offer to gratinee the onion soup, which was good and NOT over salted.  Again, add a slice of bread and the cheese, available at one of the stations, and you're there.  The desert crepes were very good - freshly made and satisfying large.  (I was looking for a taste of Brandy in the apple crepe but could not detect it.)  The cheesecake was also good.   I was able to skip the line by making a reservation the day before.  The service was OK - typical of the buffets in town.",

King Crab Legs Eggs Benedict Hash Browns Mussels Clams Some really good soup thing in a breadbowl Quiches Pesto Pasta Meat Sauce Pasta Creme Brulee Other desserts I couldn't pinpoint (blame the champagne) ...and other things I can't remember (blame the champagne again)  The servers were pretty attentive to our party of 10 who got all bottomless champagne glasses. They were good about refilling and bringing us water, ketchup, etc. We had to wait about 30 minutes before getting in but that's not too bad compared to some other buffets. The decor here is cute! Felt like I was sitting outside on a cobblestone sidewalk in Paris. Cute cute cute...  But YAY! I'm a fan.",

We all stayed at the Monte Carlo but quickly figured out that the food there SUCKED!!!    A cousin suggested the breakfast buffet at the Paris Hotel. Hesitant but hungry, I went.  I was pleased. Your usual eggs, sausages, bacon, toast..but add crepes, a large fruit section...A CHEESE SECTION (they had me there), oatmeal, cream of wheat.....and the pastry section was divine.  Bite size croissants, danishes, cookies, creme brulees, muffins.  Adorable.    Don't forget the popular omelet bar and the usual waffle/pancake section.  I really liked this hotel and this buffet.  Thumbs up if you choose to go this route!!!",

Because its the best meal of the day!! - yummy pancakes - a crepe chef making your choice of crepes - an omelette man making anything you desire - and bread, fruit, cheese, cookies, waffles...etc Soo much to eat for breakfast and the best part is that it is all fresh!!!  Lunch: 3 stars: - good mash potatoes with garlic and onions -chicken breast seasoned to perfection - rice was not good at all, way too much salt. - yummy garlic rolls - nasty shrimp, did not taste fresh - Huge dessert table, chocolate cake, cookies, flan, cheesecake, ice cream,brownies, macaroons, more cakes. The cookies were pretty good, soft inside and crunchy on the outside. Overall rating: 3.5",

I have tried the weekend breakfast buffet twice in the past two months and both times found the omelettes to be perfectly made, the breads fresh and delicious, and all the other dishes I tried were 1)original and 2)tasty!  There were many food options, all at different stations or \"regions\" of cooking so I think all preferences can be satisfied here.  I don't know that I would spend the money to take my kids again because it was a little pricier than other buffets, but a definite return for the hubby and me!",

    "text": "Pros:   * Nearly everything I got was premium in taste   * Lamb, Duck, Tri-Tip, and Crab . Yum !   * Seating    * Atmosphere  Cons:   * Felt rushed   * No hot crab legs    * No discount offered with Player's Card   * No flavored ice tea   * Sushi didn't fancy me (nor did their Clam Chowder)      After walking around the strip for quite sometime, my girlfriend and I decided we'd try this buffet out.  Price for dinner on a Monday night was $24.99/pp.  In comparison to the rest of the places to eat around Paris, we thought it was a pretty good deal and we would get a variety.      Seating after entering the buffet came fast.  We were literally seated the minute we walked in (but it was 9:45 pm so I didn't expect a wait).  I like the atmosphere of the buffet.  It's almost as if it was a street corner full of restaurants.  It had the look as if you were dining outside.  It was different and I liked it.  We got seated in a corner that was near a wall.  No complaints there.  I actually like the fact that we wouldn't have to worry about people walking by every 5 seconds and accidentally bump into our chair or table.      When ordering my drink, I asked for Raspberry Ice Tea, but they didn't have that so I opted for Sierra Mist.  When I got to the actual buffet, I was pretty astonished at some of the stuff they had:  Sushi, Crab Legs, Lamb, Bow-tie Pesto, Poached Salmon, Clam Chowder, etc. etc... the list goes on.     Nearly everything I sampled was really good.  There were a few that I didn't care for much.  I figured mentioning those would do more good to anyone considering going to Le Village Buffet.  Read below under \"Tips\" for more info on what I didn't care for.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but the reason I didn't is because when arriving, I asked the lady at the register if there was still enough time to enjoy eating since it was near 10.  She told me we had an hour to eat before they would close down the buffet.  However, while eating; someone approached us at 10:30 and told us to make our final selections because the buffet was about to shutdown and that we would have to be out by 11.  I don't know why I was eating at the buffet this late anyhow, I get it.  It's just that the girl told me we had 1 hour when really we only had 30 minutes to actually get food at the buffet.  No biggie, we were practically done eating.  We did feel a little rushed (especially since my girlfriend didn't get a chance to make her way to the dessert yet).  Overall:    Aside from feeling a bit rushed,  I'd say a really good buffet with some very tasty selections.    Tips:   *  Sushi was not good at all.  I had one piece and was done.    *  Clam Chowder was nice to see on the menu, but wow it was extremely thick and I'm not even exaggerating.  I love Clam Chowder, but Le Village's was just too much.   *  Come before 10pm if you are eating dinner here.  10pm is last seating, but as you read above it would be wiser to come earlier.   *  Don't forget to check out the very far left section:  this is where the lamb, tri-tip steak and other goodies are.  You can even make your own Gyro!   * along w/ making your own Gyro, there is a Crepe station too.  Yum.   *  Come hungry!  Seriously!!",

    "text": "The Paris lunch buffet is awesome and one of the best in Vegas.  If not for the Wynn, I would have named this buffet as the best in Vegas.  I love their set-up and how they cateorize each section by the different areas of France.  Being able to sit in a \"village\" setting under a faux blue sky was nice, but I think that they could have increased the lighting since it seemed a bit dark.    It was my first time there and I had some things not usually found at other casino buffets.  They had a really delicious roast duck with a sweet glaze...it was just the tiniest bit dry, but it was still good enough that I had two breast pieces and a leg.  I also liked their salmon in the creamy leek sauce.  The salmon skin was crisp on top and it was surprisingly tender in the center.  Unlike many other buffets, the salmon was not dry and over-cooked.  The best dish out of the entire buffet, though, was the mussels in saffron sauce, which was amazingly good.  Even with all the food I had just eaten, I had two full bowls of these mussels.  Dip the sauce with their fresh bread (yes, its the cardinal rule of buffets to not fill up on carbs, but the bread here, was fresh and delicious) and its out of this world.        I also liked their fresh crepe station, though I wished that they had savory as well as sweet fillings.  Strawberries and bananas were missing as filling options (though they did have blueberries and some really gross, gooey apple filling), though they were VERY generous with their nutella.  Having a nutella crepe with whipped cream and slivered almonds on top was the best way to end a meal here.  I can't remember the dessert section too much, since my dessert consisted of the crepe.  I think I might have had some creme brulee there, but it wasn't anything that stood out in my mind.    Overall, an excellent buffet.  Service was good, though a little slow.  The line wasn't too long when we went and we were seated fairly quickly.  Le Village Buffet has a good selection of interesting foods and its definitely one of the buffets I'd return to!",

We were staying at Paris so we headed here for our last meal before hitting the road home.  The line was SUPER long but it went fast and we got a table within 30 min despite the lady at the front saying that it was going to be at least an hour.    Food is divided up based on their relative provinces in France, cute! Some stuff was delicious, some stuff was eh, some I took a bite and that was it...  The crepes sucked though, wtf? We saw a fatty ass line for the fresh crepes and we thought, \"THOSE MUST BE GOOD!\" Took a bite and it was blech, one of the worst crepes I've had.  Come on, this is a French joint, you're supposed to own at the French food. Crepes are to the French like burritos are to the Mexicans. dammit. The crepe itself was kind of dry and the filling was just fruit - no mascarpone, no whipped cream, just some canned fruit. I was sad.  However, there were tons of seafood options and the prime rib wasn't bad either. Desserts were awesome! Their fruit tarts were delicious and their macaroons were some of the best I've had.  Overall, pretty cute, but I really can't handle buffets.  I liked this one more than the Bellagio buffet and the Rio primarily because of the variety and the assortment of dishes you don't typically find at buffets.  However, it is French food so it is ridiculously heavy.  I wanted to cry for the hour after because I was so stuffed.  Also had to unbutton my pants which was SUPER awk since I got in a car afterward with my boyfriend's guy friends. w00t.",

You get a far better selection and tasty food at Harrah's.  First is the long wait because some people don't realize this place has gone down the toilet.  I could not find any tasty to eat because everything was too filthy.  How did this place get an A?  While you are in line, there is a person that comes out and tells you the wait is going to be an hour or more.  That is an exaggeration.  The food stations have many things littered along the dishes and the counter.  I can't believe that there is no one here to pick up the scraps around the dishes (probably from other customer not being able to work the tongs correctly).  Why is the seafood right next to the fresh fruit?  That doesn't sound right.  The risotto was hard.  Everything has a french twist and that's what made the food taste nasty.  This is due to failed execution.  Why does the crepe look like a diaper?  Is this highlight of the buffet the crepes or the frozen custard machine?  That was the most enjoyable dish.  Take an ice cream cone and get some frozen custard.  They can't mess that up.  Is the restaurant suppose to be filthy all over or is this how they envision what France should look like?  Are they being authenic and I just don't know it?  I like tasty good food but this place had none of that for dinnner.  I was here at 8pm.  Perhaps they ran out of food again and this was leftovers from yesterday.",

I've been reading a number of the reviews on here, and not a lot of positive is being said about it, but for some reason, when a group of 6 of us made our way into the Le Village Buffet.. the Prime Rib was the toast of the table.  It was juicy, succulent, and would fall apart just by cutting it with the side of your fork.  Also, we checked out Prime Rib at the buffets at both the Rio and Planet Hollywood and they paled in comparison.  The selection here was not 'worldly,' but it did offer a variety of good desserts and there were a number of vegetarian options for those in our party that had to avoid the meaty goodness.  Another standout was the omelette bar, which had a ton of options and really was surprisingly good.  Our server Debra was very polite and kept our bottomless mimosas full (we went on Sunday for brunch, where apparently it is always free).  She made us smile.  For Le Village Buffet, anytime is Prime-time.",

I've never left a lunch feeling so absolutely drunk. Of course the food itself was also fantastic, compared to many other buffets.   If you're looking for good quality food and want some alcohol to go along then it is absolutely worth buying the unlimited alcohol add on.   Finally, the service was top notch as well. We pretty much immediately got the drinks we ordered (tipping helps a lot) and our waitresses were very friendly. They even seemed to enjoy the fact that we were getting so drunk at lunch",

    "text": "Whoever runs this place should be fired!  I was in town to play a Video Poker Tournament at Bally's.  I was up playing poker until 6:00am and was up around 10:00am so I was pretty tired and too lazy to walk/drive anywhere to eat.  I always see a long line whenever I walk by the buffet.  I just thought the food must be OK.  Boy was I wrong!!!    We didn't have to wait at all since we were able to go through Diamond entrance.  The cashier and host were very nice, so no complains here.    Long long time ago when Paris first opened, we did dine here once.  I could not recall my experience but I am sure it wasn't bad enough for me to remember it.    The host led us to our table and took our drink orders.  She said to go ahead to the buffet and our server would get our drinks.  Well, when we returned to our table after getting our food, the drinks were not there.  When the waitress finally showed up, she had to ask what we wanted to drink again!  After she got our drinks, we hardly saw her again.  She was more interested in cleaning up tables than serving tables.  Maybe she should have taken a job as a bus girl instead of a server.  I had to flag her down a couple of times to get crab cracker (not sure if this is what it is called) and wet towelette.  She never came by to check if we needed refill or anything.    And the food was the worst buffet I have ever seen.  The selections were very minimal.  The only thing good was the omelet from the omelet station, but who can mess up on omelet!  The crab legs were OK.  The crepe was bleh.  I also got a thin cut of what I thought was roast beef, but I am pretty sure I got lamb.  I don't eat lamb and I know the smell of lamb.  I couldn't tell until I sat down on the table and smelled the 'funny smell'.  I couldn't even take a bite.  I am really upset the lady mistaken the lamb for beef!    I walked around trying to find something else to eat but nothing really looked appetizing.  I settled for a small bowl of salad.  I figured I could just get some dessert to make me happy.  When I walk around the dessert 'house', the place looked deserted!  There was nobody attending the dessert house!  There was no cookies, no cakes, just a few pieces of pies, and a soft-serve station.  I was a few fruit tarts inside but I couldn't get to them!  What the hell happened?  This is Paris!!!!  It's supposed to have good pastries, right?    Both my fiance and I left in great disappointment.  And I am really upset I wasted $50 from my comp credit for this sh!%ty buffet!  My fiance filled out the survey card, but I am sure it'd just be thrown to the trash can.    On my way out, I really wanted to tell all the people that were still waiting in line to 'run'.  There are plenty of other places to eat buffet.  Don't be lazy like me, because you'd pay for it like me and hate yourself afterwards!",

The best meat was the prime rib which wasn't as good as other places. I really was expecting to find spectacular French cuisine but didn't find any dishes that I wanted seconds of and I tried a little bit of everything! The crepes were freshly made but after a few bites I was disappointed. The crepes from the pizzeria directly in front of the buffet are much better.   I'm not too much of a seafood person but the crab legs and sushi looked good.  I definitely would not eat there again!!!",

The coffee is also worthy of an honorable mention: bold and full of flavor.   We were seated in the main room next to the entrance, which is prone to high foot traffic and the occasional tired toddler.   The service is pleasant although the hostesses provide an impression that guests are a cog in the food factory. At $31 per head, this is one of the best value buffets on the strip.  Tip: make a reservation on OpenTable, 24 hours in advance to skip the lengthy line.",

We were seated immediately on a Sunday at 3:30. The waiter service was wonderful. Our cups were never empty. There was a variety of foods to choose from, including a crepe station. The chefs were always filling the trays. The sweets gave me a mini heart attack. I wanted one of each but I resisted. I tried about half of them and they were all so amazing, especially the macaroons. Buffet prices are rather expensive for a family but with a groupon, it's an awesome choice !",

One important thing I did try to look for in Lunch was crab, which they only have for dinner. Expected.   - They have a good selection of seafood stews! Loved the combination of mussels, scallops, and clams the best. I think it was called seafood bouillabaisse. I helped myself to 3 bowls. haha - Avoid the sushi. Pre-made. Hard. Not worth stomach space, if you know what I mean.  - There was about 5 people ahead of me when I got my crepe, so there was about a 10 minute wait. They don't have just strawberries bc they have a frozen combination of pre-cut fruits, but the chef was nice enough to pick out just strawberries for me. I recommend not passing this up! Although not great, It's an alright alternative from paying the $11 crepe outside of Le Village. Haha.  - I was slightly disappointed that their soups did not look fresh at the time. I love buffet soups. I did not get a soup this time.  - The pastas were great. Definitely grab the cavatappi pasta with truffle cream!  - Sides were delicious. I enjoyed the mac n cheese and scalloped potatoes.  - The macarons were decent. A bit crispy and not too chewy. Wicked spoon is better.  - They gave us a bottle of Copper Ridge white zinfindel, which was pretty good. The bottle is usually around $10 at the store, so it was a good deal!",

Even if you don't speak French (I haven't retained a lick of 3 years of H.S. French aside from \"do you speak English?\" and \"would you go to bed with me?\"), I'm sure you're fluent enough in \"foodie\" to understand...   Located in the opulent Paris Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, Le Village is my favorite buffet amongst the \"big\" hotels, rivaled closely by the monstrosity of a buffet over at Bellagio (of course, I am just another wh0rish tourist, so what do I know... Hi, Vegas Yelpers!!) and a Vegas junket just isn't complete until we've brunch'd here.  Just steps away from the cobblestone path, under a painted sky, you'll find a low-lit French village facade representing a general culinary summation of five French provinces.  It's a kitschy-cute setting, cottages crafted and modeled with a little cartoon-iness which is either endearing (a la Disney's \"It's A Small World\") or will make you kvetch (also a la Disney's \"It's A Small World\")...  Because of the French theme and focus to regional namesakes, the offerings at Le Village are prepared with a modicum of practice and expertise, achieving, I assume, a notable reflection and taste of common French dishes (though, not being astute to the nuances of French cuisine, I could be blissfully ignorantly wrong!).  Creme sauces, wine reductions, puffed pastries, and savory dishes aplenty!  For lighter/smaller appetites, there is a [regrettably unremarkable] salad bar, chilled seafood bar, a selection of cheeses, and a pastry bar, though these seem a bit like an afterthought in comparison to the entree areas.  Peach (apricot?) Duck.  Lamb Cheek Stew.  Scallops.  Etcetera etcetera!!  So, if you're going to have single all-day-sustaining, pre-drunken state, $20-some-odd-number, \"let's buffet because we're in Vegas\" meal... I'd consider Le Village...  Allez !  Allez !  Ce'tait genial!",

A lot of foods were repeated in different stations such as rice and fatty pasta dishes.  The salad station was also very weak, and honestly I had wanted to fill up on good veggies or fruits.  There were not a lot of vegetable options and the fruits that were there (ex cut up honeydew) looked old and unappealing.  The best items I had there were the steamed clams, steamed mussels, a berry crepe, and the macaroons.  There were also mini eclairs and those I generally love but it was pretty dry and the frosting layer was thin and hard.  I would rather pay $25 somewhere else and get one nice plate of fish or salad.  Also, I think this price included a soft drink.  The people up front don't ask you if you even want a drink I think they just charge you for it and assume you will get a soft drink.  For me this wasn't a good deal because I only wanted water.  I definitely won't be back.  On a side note another reason I wouldn't venture back is because I asked for another set of silver ware that never came from my server, so I had to steal a new set off another table.  When I opened the new set all the silverware inside the napkin were horribly and visibly dirty!  I can't believe some server actually took the time to take those filthy pieces of silverware, put them in a napkin and ROLL THEM UP in it.  Just not worth the price.  Sorry!  The workers were friendly but the food options, quality of food, and cleanliness are only worth about $10- $15.",

    "text": "My family and I went to this buffet as part of the Buffet of Buffets package. Of the seven different buffet options this by far was the best. The quality of the food was great. The food options are a little bit limited as compared to other buffets, but everything they serve was cooked right. The desert bar was extensive with the best creme brulee I have tasted. This buffet also offers fresh crepes which can be topped with your choice of toppings. Get there early because the line can get long. It could take upwards of an hour before you get seated. Definitely a \"Don't Miss in Las Vegas\"!",

I then vowed to pig out right after Lent. and what better place to pig out, i thought, than the buffet places in Vegas. so, right after last Sunday morning's Easter mass, we hit the road for Vegas, with one thing on my mind - TO PIG OUT (specifically at Paris' Le Village Buffet and at Bellagio's The Buffet)!!   =)  I love love looooove this buffet.  In my opinion, this is THE buffet of all buffets, THE feast of all feasts.    Unlike Bellagio buffet, every dish here (as in EVERY dish), i tasted was flavorful (its sirloin the most uberdelish and noteworthy). Unlike Bellagio, dishes here were bathed in lush sauces.  Unlike Bellagio, we got sated here not  from the immense selection or quantity, but from the QUALITY of its dishes.    i must have gained at least a pound here.  Merci beaucoup, Le Village Buffet!  =)",

It doesn't take a math nerd to figure out that it's not worth it!!!!  For half that price you can get a good meal without feeling the need to stuff yourself like Kobayashi in order to feel like you got your money's worth.  But what am I saying, that is so un-American... skip a buffet, and the terrorists win, I guess.  The line to get in was intolerable.  Our group relegated itself to playing word association games in order to keep ourselves from going crazy from the 1 hr wait.  (Side note: if it were up to me I would have left after seeing the line, but others in the party wanted to go, so I relented.  Believe me, I will hold it over their head like the sword of Damocles, oh, don't you worry.)  The scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon were dismal.  They had a crepe station that seemed okay, but remember, you're paying $25! Imagine how many individual crepes you can get at this price!!  They had prime rib which was about a 5.75/10, and the rest was completely forgettable.  I guess the Coke they served was okay, it was about a 7/10.  The desserts were acceptable, they had small interpretations of what was supposed to be creme brulee which didn't disgust me.  As expected, within an hour, I felt queasy.  You win, gastro-terrorists... you win.",

I felt like I was sitting at the eating area in Disneyland (this is actually going to be a compliment so keep reading) that sits between Fantasyland and Big Thunder Mountain.  The faux-outdoor-feeling-under-the-blue-concrete-sky was accentuated by the  little buildings set up around the main \"outdoor\" dining area which gave it the Disneyland feel but my friends and I were seated under a tree which added to the ambiance.  Our server was fast, funny, and had a big smile for us each time she came by.  I think her name was Ivanka but I'm not sure.  Anyway, she was great.  The food is supposed to be from different parts of France but regardless, I only saw proteins, vegetables, and desserts and I partook equally.  Walked out of there pretty stuffed.",

I remember the desserts being so good that I stuffed myself with them even though I was way past my limit.  Now?  Let's just say they aren't far from Hometown/Old Country Buffet's quality.

I thought the lamb and prime rib was pretty good, but not amazing. The shrimp and crab legs were left for you to peel and crack on your own. Being the lazy person that I am, I didn't enjoy that too much, especially when the crackers were nowhere to be found. The one thing that I really enjoyed was the crepe station. They had made to order crepes, with your choice of fruit fillings or nutella. Being the greedy person that I am, I got two, which stuffed my stomach beyond capacity. It was not a good feeling. This was also before I enjoyed those delicious mini bread bowls filled with a seafood mix. I was impressed that they actually had macarons, which are quite laborious to make. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by how they tasted. They tasted very stale and the filling wasn't good at all. I guess it was to be expected because this was a buffet and not Bouchon Bakery. Le Village is a little bit cheaper compared to the other buffets in Vegas, but I think I would spend the extra few bucks to have a higher quality food product.",

We had to wait around 40 mins to get a table, when there were plenty table to be used. To the hotel: Just get rid of the \"Reserved Seating\". If someone were VIP, they wouldn't go eating at a buffet for dinner.  The layout was weird. Not as straight-forward as other buffets, which separate their food from the table.  Everything at Le Village felt like it was some sort of stew, for some reason. Too much sauce with everything. The only thing I really liked was the Coq Au Vin (heh, coq). It was bomb! I got a second serving of it when I went back for another plate.  I liked the dessert bar, tho. It had a lot of French goodies. Creme Brulee, Bananers Foster, and some of those custard puff things. Creme Brulee was like a scoop of heaven in my mouth, creamy goodness. So good, I snuck one out.   Big ups to my girl who felt the need translate everything in Le Village Buffet and Paris Las Vegas.",

In one section, you can get pasta or pasta or pasta. Uh... OK, i guess I'll get pasta. They arent even that tasty.   They have some other selections which just look weird! Some type of soups, stews, sausage with onion?  They also have their carving station with the usual, and I hate prime rib so I wont even rate it.  Their turkey is OK.  Surrounded by their carving station, the usual sides mashed potatoes,  carrots, legumes, country fried potatoes.  And again, it all is just AVERAGE.  The only station I really like is their GRILL - YUMMY! They have a variety of vegetables like asparagus, squash, onion, then some yummy meats like steak, lamb, chicken and sausage! SCORE!  Their bread pudding is pretty good too! I always add some soft-serve vanilla ice cream! *drools*  My boyfriend would rate them 5 stars just for their CREPE STATION. They have a variety of fillings like apple, strawberry, blueberry, etc. and toppings such as chocolate, different syrups and fresh CHANTILLY CREAM!

The dessert station was just downright disappointing, especially for this to be a French themed buffet, and I found it weird how the omelet station is right in the middle of the dessert station.  I saw a lot of people around me eating the crab legs, but the crab legs gave off a weird smell so I did not touch them.  Our server was great. She was nice and very friendly. She made the experience better with wit.  Overall the experience was okay and I'd probably go back if someone was paying for me (like they did this time), but I wouldn't go if I had to pay for it (or if I had to pay full price).",

We stopped in here for the brunch buffet when we got in, and I have to say I was impressed. This was probably one of the better (if not the best) buffet we've had in Vegas. The selection is not a huge around the world style offering (like a lot of buffets) where you just have a whole lot of selections of crap. The more \"French\" focus seems to help with this. That's not to say the selection is limited though. Some definite highlights were the French onion soup, prime rib, and the crepe station (specifically the banana Nutella crepe). The service was also really good, and the unlimited mimosas kept flowing. I really do like the ambiance of this location as well as it doesn't just feel like you are in a college dining hall. There was no wait when we got there , but I've definitely seen a long line for this buffet, but they take reservations so be sure to check. If you are into Vegas buffets, this one is definitely worth a stop.",

I usually find buffets dangerous because I end up eating too much at them (which was mostly okay for this trip because we ended up having about one meal a day thanks to them), but in this case I barely had anything to eat. It costs about the same per person as ordering one dish at any of the other restaurants so I was thinking the selection would be great to have, but boy was I wrong.  The only thing that made me happy here was the creme brulee and the raspberries on some of the dessert items. I love raspberries.  Second of all? It took us almost the entire meal before a very winded waitress finally came by for our drink orders. I tried stopping somebody and asking at one point, and they just said \"Oh she's busy trying to get everybody else drinks. She'll get to you guys.\" I love getting my drink at the end of my meal?

The main reason my wife and I tried it was because of the Groupon that was available which gave us half off for the dinner buffet and unlimited drinks.  The food was good but if I'm going to pay what would have been over $100.00 for my wife and I, I expect something much tastier than good.  Let me preface this by saying their crepe station is fantastic.  The banana's foster crepe was really, really delicious so I would start at the crepe station if I were to return.  In addition that they did have crab legs and shrimp.  If you are looking for good crab legs this is not the place for you.  Some were still frozen and most were quite small.  The prime rib was good but not great.  The station that had little cast irons serving bowls was good as well.  I had the pork belly and the beef bourguignon.  Both were tasty.  As I stated the food was overall pretty good but the service was absolutely terrible.  We literally had to track down our waitress if we wanted another drink and she acted like we were pulling her teeth out when we did.  If you get the Groupon deal that gets half off the meal and drinks I think it's worth it, but just barely.  I definitely would not pay full price for the meal.  I give it three stars because of the Groupon.",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars.  It's better than your average Vegas buffet, but not as good as the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and The Orleans (YUP!).  It also got bumped up half a star because they had good crab legs.  In fact, my friend injured a finger and squirted crab juice across the table as she devoured those meaty legs.  We all went primal.  I was cracking em with my teeth and smelled of crab for the next 12 hours. The choices were abundant, but I suggest staying away from the pasta section.  Made to order dessert crepes were available, but I was hoping for a savory selection as well.  Lots of rich sauces covered chicken, beef, pork, turkey, and seafood.  Not bad.  It's $25 for dinner and the wait was over an hour.  Not worth the wait, but we had vouchers, so of course, we waited.",

When you walk in, you are seated and asked what you would like to drink.  You are then given the freedom to peruse the buffet.  Doing so will bring you to many regions of France.  There are many different stations catering to that particular region's specialty.  You can't go wrong with the eggs benedict or the butter croissants.  The crepes are okay; they are a little too doughy.  The quiche Lorraine and their tarts are delectable!    When I come to Vegas, I ALWAYS have to come here for breakfast at least once.  Although the noise level is high, the visual ambiance drowns out the other patrons so that you can escape to France.",

Let's say that this place is not overrated, but it's no where near my favorite, Wynn's.  The wait was a major bummer as we waited for almost 90 minutes for their brunch.  It was worth it at the end, but it was too ridiculous.  The food was delicious in many of the aspects.  They did some of the big ones like everyone else like prime rib steak and crap legs.  The deserts are very well made.  They also served out some of the best crepes I have ever had.  The service was also good, so there's not much of a downside going here.  I do understand that this place will be popular because the dinner is only $24.95 compare to the more costlier options like Bellagio or Wynn's.  But the wait was again too long for my taste.  Quality: **** Decor: ***** Service:*** Amenity: ***** Ambiance: *****  In the end, this would be second favorite among all Las Vegas buffet.",

I've had the dinner buffet here probably 7 or 8 times and keep coming back.  Mom calls all buffets \"smorgasbords\" or \"booof-ays.\"   I recommend taking a lap around all of the food so you know your options and, if you have to pace yourself at all you know how to be/remain prepared.  I plan to try the \"buffet of buffets\" deal soon, they used to have a similar deal in Atlantic City and maaaaan the seafood buffet at Showboat in AC was pretty great.  But Paris Le Village Buffet is the bar by which I judge all others.  After reading these, Ima try the breakfast buffet too.",

    "text": "Striking a balance between quality and affordability, Le Village is one of the best buffets on the strip. It happens to be in a fabulous mid-strip location as well.   The last couple times I have been to this buffet, I got $4 off my lunches which brought the buffet to be $13.99 for lunch. I cannot complain for that price not to mention the sizable selection they have spanning across multiple ethnic foods and a decent dessert bar/station. Their dessert bar isn't as nice as Wynn's and my favorite place and the mother of all quality buffets overall would have to be Bellagio. However, I would probably be paying about double what I paid at Paris and more than half of the buffet food that the other two serve can be found at Paris.   The service has been quite good each time I went to this buffet. Although there was a line (be prepared to wait a bit though I was able to get in with a 15 minute wait), it removed rather quick. I was seated and grabbed my food. The server came by to grab my drink orders and to subsequently check in multiple times.   Even without the coupon, I would go there again. It offers a wide selection of food while being more affordability than many places on the strip. The food is way better than other buffets that are a couple dollars less such as Imperial Palace's or Circus Circus.",

Paris Le Village Buffet was always a MUST for breakfast.    But in the 4 years or so since I have visited, it has gone WAY down hill.  In the past, you could try cheeses and pates, freshly baked breads and croissants, crusty quiches,  just an amazing assortment. If you could think of a breakfast dish, it was there -- and it was well made.   Imagine our disappointment to discover that our beloved buffet has become nothing but a laden trough of processed dishes that taste at best--average.    Seriously, it all tasted like it had been bought from Sam's Warehouse.   I give it two stars since they still have the freshly made crepe station and the service was good, but honestly this is not worth waiting in line for in anyway.   If you have eaten there before 2007 and remember it being awesome, you are in for an extreme let down.",

    "text": "The hostess was very nice, we got seated right away, and we proceeded to the buffet line.  I'll start with the positive first.  There were lots of starches from rice pilaf, saffron rice, mashed potatoes, breads, and pastas.  The spiral macaroni and cheese with mushrooms and asparagus was very tasty and the fruit tarts and the chocolate eclair were quite good.  On the other hand, it seemed like the mussels had been reheated a couple of times because as much as I love mussels, I couldn't eat those mussels.  They were dried out and hard, it was the weirdest thing.  I got the fist batch from the main buffet line, and thinking it was a fluke, I went to the seafood station to try those mussels and those were just as bad.  It was almost like jerky Moving to the meats, I decided that I was going to try their lamb and the carver didn't even cut me a fresh piece.  Instead he gave me 2 really little pieces, I'm talking like slivers, that were already cut and sitting on the board and I think I was so shocked at the piece that he gave me that I didn't say anything.  I put a few more things on my plate and sat down to eat.   Turned out that the portion of lamb was good because the piece was so dry and hard that I couldn't even eat it.  By this time I was so disappointed I couldn't eat anymore from the main line.  I asked for a glass of wine and was TOLD that I would have to pay $4.23 for a glass of wine but I wasn't told how I was supposed to pay for a glass, I was just TOLD what the price was.  If all this wasn't enough, the busser pushed a cart full of dirty dishes right pass me, so close I had to move my elbow.  This dirty dishes cart stayed in the main room of the restaurant and actually got in the way of the customers at times.  I look up to see one of the bussers scraping the food off the plate and into a tray on the cart. It just killed my appetite and I was done.",

They had signs in the corner (not in operation) where you could pay $10 to bypass the line similar to Rio's Carnival World Buffet $5 fee.

First off, I have to say their sushi selection is pitiful. They had sushi rolls with a piece of cucumber + rice. No real fish. And a california roll (Avocado so old it was brown). But fine fine.. this is a french buffet.. so lets critique the french food. I think the only thing that was good was the ratatouille, some of thier pasta, quiche, and the shrimp. Otherwise this whole buffet was a disappointed. Food was SO bland. All the food was luke warm and had been sitting out for so long. Most of the times you couldn't even tell what you were scooping up because nothing was labeled!!!  Maybe it was a slow night? It was a Sunday night and there were NO lines and lots of empty tables for a 6pm dinner!!! So I think the food was sitting out for a long time. The most disgusting part was the piles of cold, burnt,  grilled vegetables soaked in oil.   I can say thier desserts were a bit better. But after tasting bouchon's bakery (Venetian) - I  was utterly disappointed.  Me and my friends actually did not eat very much because the quality of food was so sketchy we didn't think it was worth trying  I heard the champagne brunch is good on Sundays. Maybeeeee I will try that. Price wise, one of the cheaper buffets in Vegas. Only $25 for dinner.",

I really was blown away with most of the food's taste. The crepes are made to order, and the cooks are very nice. The dessert station was a little lacking compared to other buffets, but they make up for it with all of the breakfast and lunch foods.   The atmosphere is very nice. It is set up like a small village with many secluded sitting areas inside of small \"houses\" and you go \"outside\" to get the food.   Never before had I been able to eat crepes, duck, lamb, and crab legs in one meal. If you are the kind of person who likes a wide variety of food and likes to try new things, I highly recommend this buffet.",

    "text": "I will not comment on the food, it's a buffet, what do you expect. But the service, horribly terrible.  My wife and I was going to meet up with some friends at the Village Buffet and when we got there our group of 6 friends already seated. So I asked the hostess to seat us next to our friends. The hostess then said she will have to charge us an automatic 18% gratuity because our party would be 8 people.  I said, I'm asking you to seat us next to our friends, not at their table, her reply was, that the 18% gratuity would still apply, because it's the same server. I said \"WHAT?!?\" Not that I'm a stiff, I usually tip at least 15% or higher depends on the service.  After a brief argument trying to explain to the hostess they can't charge 18% because I want to sit next to someone.  My friend's table would still be 6 people, my table is only 2 people.  After some back and forth she told me she will sit me but I'll have to wait. I said fine, I'm willing to wait. After waiting for about 15 minutes, there were at least 2 tables in that area opened up, but the hostess still didn't sit me.  After waiting for another 5 minutes I saw the hostess walking a group of 4 people from the line to sit in that area.  I walked up to the hostess and confronted the hostess telling her I've been waiting for 20 minutes, how dare she put some one in that table before me?  She then goes to explain \"well you don't understand, there's reservation this and that blah blah blah\".  I told her, nonsense, this is a buffet, there's no reservation.  At this point I was furious and I was letting the hostess know about it, she knows that I will not let her win so she decided to sit me.  After the meal, I did not leave any tip, because my service that day don't warrant any tip. Except for a TIP I left on a piece of paper for the hostess. Your tip for the day; Try to accommodate customer's simple request Service with a smile Customer is always right If you do all these, you will surely deserve a big gratuity",

    "text": "Le Village Buffet at Paris is le fail.   Expectations weren't that high considering I already knew Wynn, Bellagio, or Studio B buffet would trounce this place any day of the week, even on an off night.  The breads just sucked, no flavor and questionably stale. Insulting to the French culture to serve bread that just isn't good, and calling themselves Paris Las Vegas. I've had better at Hue Thai and Baguette Cafe.   The fettuccine alfredo just tasted like watered down alfredo mix. I know this is a buffet, but how can you fail so badly with fettuccine alfredo? The pesto sauce spaghetti helped to redeem them.  The mussels weren't even remotely fresh, with a strong fishy taste. A sign that it wasn't very fresh.   My experience was the mussels didn't make me want to chance it with the sushi. I didn't want a dose of lax with my meal. The other person in our group confirmed its suckiness, and he isn't as hard of a reviewer as me.  Half of the chicken was very moist since it was near the skin, and the other half was dryer than Vegas on a summer day.  One of the saving grace of the meal was the crepes and waffle station. It amazed me how the chef was just making the crepes with ease. This and the waffles tasted great.  The first round of prime rib was a little dry. Round 2 and 3 were much better, but they were also very rare. It would make even Dexter faint. I could have loaded up on this all day, but a little too early in the day to do this.  This place does have snow crab legs and claws, but its such a PITA to eat because they don't crack it open nicely like the Wynn. I'm sure there are people who would have loaded up on this, but it wasn't worth my time.  The champagne was a poor quality. Don't bother unless you just want the free alcohol. Just go play at the penny slots and get yourself some free drinks instead.  I didn't get a chance to try the desert, but the others in our group says its good.  Our group got a nice cozy and quiet room, but also got a rocky table. We McGuvyer'd it with a bunch of sugar packets on the base of the table.  Service from our first waiter just wasn't good. He forgot which drinks we ordered. Carding me for the champagne even though I didn't want any, couldn't even recognize the birthday on my Nevada ID, and still pouring the champagne into my glass even after I said no. Even interrupting our conversation just to pour the champagne in front of my face. Just either walk around to pour the glasses or just take the glass off the table to pour. I know this isn't a 5 star place, but a little common sense goes a long way. Our second waiter was more attentive, clearing our plates in a timely manner and refilling our drinks without asking.  But $30 for mediocre to below average food for lunch when I can spend a couple of bucks more at the Wynn and get dinner, makes this place already lose a star. Had it been a little less, it would be understandable.   Go to the Studio B buffet if you're coming from SoCal, much better stuff and cheaper prices. Otherwise, spend a little more money for the Bellagio or the Wynn. You're on vacation, spend the extra couple of bucks to get a better meal.",

    "text": "What happened to this buffet? It started with the cashier when we paid for dinner. The cashier had no sign of any enthusiasm. As if she was ready to go home at 4 pm. Then the host who was in charge to give us a table even lacked more customer service. She was on the phone talking to her family- I'm like really? Aren't you on the clock? As if she was on her break. The server who helped us was nice and very attentive. She knew when to ask us for beverage, water or coffee.  Let's talk about the crepe station. That guy looked like he did not want to be there to begin with. The cold section where the seafood was, smelled like nasty sewer. They did not fill what was out, and the floor on that station looked like as if you were in the wet market.  I would like to compliment the guys who worked in the steak section. They were very kind and friendly. They had all the enthusiasm in the world that 65 % of the crew did not have. The prime rib is BOMB! It goes well with that french gravy! I think i's called Burgundy sauce. Top it off with mushroom and side of the rice pilaf (the one with butter) and woaaallah! Dinner is served! You have to try the macaroni and cheese- another <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! There were 2 types of rice pilaf, and both were yummy! And last but not the least; the dessert. Creme Bulee, Flan and etc. There were lots of delicious treats to go for. Don't forget the crepe. You can add stuff to your crepe right on your own table like, the flan and some chocolate from the dessert station.   I have to say I really like this buffet but, change is definitely a must! The atmosphere with the workers looked like there were tension among the diversity of the race. As if they were not happy to work there. They did not want to work together as a team and just wanted to mind their own business. The guys in the steak section- they need to take a page from their book. They knew what great customer service was, and they looked like they enjoy what they do. If not for the tension among the staff, the dirty seafood section and the cashier & host  who lacked professionalism- I would have rated this buffet a 4 or even 5. A lot of delicious stuff in the variety for a fair price.",

    "text": "THE BEST $7 DINNER BUFFET (OR DINNER MEAL) EVER  But wait wait a minute Gerald isn't the dinner buffet including taxes cost about $32 per person? Yes it does. Being a Total Rewards Card Member I was eligible to redeem $25 on food. I redeemed that amount and paid the difference of the buffet. Please note my review below isn't normally written for someone that paid the regular price, but someone who paid just $7 for dinner.  The layout of food of this buffet is about one-fourth smaller than Bacchanal Buffet. However for this buffet my approach was similar to Bacchanal Buffet - get small portions on the plate. My goal was at least to get 7 plates so that I would only pay $1 per plate. I won't list all the items I ate, but I will highlight the items that stood out. The lamb leg, which is very French, wasn't gamey but flavorable because of the herbs. Since yesterday was St. Patrick's Day corned beef was served. Classical French dishes like pork and beans cassoulet and sausage and bratwurst choucroute garnie reminded me of dishes at Les Halles in New York. This buffet has a crepe station where your can order different types of crepes. Pork belly with apples is a classical French country dish. In the end I didn't end up getting seven plates of dishes; I got nine. A calculation that results in less than $1 per plate. You can say I got my monies worth.  Whereas most buffets display random items of food, this buffet stands out because there are dishes from different regions of France. These regions act as a food station. When you go to a Chinese Food buffet you can tell the buffet is Chinese because of the food that is served. At this buffet you can tell the food is French because of the regional food station.  Overall this is a decent buffet. In terms of quality and abundance of items this buffet isn't up to par with Bacchanal Buffet. However this buffet is much better in terms of quality and unique items than those Chinese buffets in the suburbs. You still be stuffed at this buffet, but you won't feel bloated as other Chinese buffets.   Is Le Village Buffet worth $32? I'm not sure. Is Le Village Buffet worth $7. HELL YEAH!",

    "text": "Let's begin with some tips!!!  1. You can book online via OpenTable 24 hours in advance to skip the line.  2. If less than 24 hours in advance call for a reservation.  3. If you are a Total Rewards member (free to join) you get a tiny discount.  4. There are 5 regions of France represented here.  5. There are different dining rooms & Le Petit Bar  6. All cocktails are $18 and a bottle of wine is a better buy.  I think I qualify as a foodie.  I studied cooking for a year. Plus, I have gotten to the point that if I can make something I don't buy that dish at restaurants especially if I can easily source the ingredients locally. Furthermore, if I love something I learn to make it ASAP.  Keep in mind this is a buffet. Dinner for two here is the price of one dinner (including appetizers and dessert) at Mon Ami Gabi. This is not Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Don't expect five star gourmet anything.  Expect French type food that can be made easily and taste good.  Expect to see other European influences.  Please tour the buffet area before making your selections. To get the most bang for your buck you might want to do this with salad plates instead of full sized plates.  That way you can try a little of most things.  Foods to skip: Duck L'orange - dry Salmon - dry French Onion Soup - there is no cheese  Foods to try: Lamb Crepes Maracon Spinach Salad Yukon Gold Potatoes Anything involving visible truffles  Miguel was our server and he was kind, informative and prompt. Miguel was also willing to take our photos and keep our glasses full.",

    "text": "Decent Buffett where the highlight used to be the crepes for breakfast. Those days have sailed unfortunately, after recently revisting this staple located in Paris. The legit french dude that worked the station was gone and whoever was manning the station today didn't have the same passion. The options remained the same sweet and savory chicken and mushroom, spinach, artichoke, and brie; and ham and cheese for savory options. Banana and strawberry for sweet.  Also missing were the truffle eggs, man  how I loved those eggs. Two different kinds of hashes  are available:A traditional corn beef hash which is great, and a chorizo hash that has a bit more flavor. Smoked salmon and trout are great solo items and both have excellent flavors. I skipped the omelet station because the line for those was pretty long. The mini apple turnovers are delightful and shouldn't be skipped. Overall a decent Buffett for breakfast, the unlimited drink package added is $13 but getting your moneys worth shouldn't be hard when most beers are $7 in any casino.",

After being seated we browsed through the offerings and to our surprise the tags, which identify the food items, were all wrong - the tags reflected all of the items associated with their breakfast items. The food was not much better than the misguided tags. After a while my wife overheard a few of the attendants saying that much of the afternoon crew did not show up for work - thus the mess-ups. The service was OK but our attendant was, apparently, called away to perform other duties, leaving us with an attendant that took care of our, as well as other customer needs. The only reason I gave it 1 start-rating was because the crab legs were not so bad, although a number of them were still frozen. Not a very good dinning experience...",

This time around (a few years since our last visit), we waited an hour for the buffet and then the food assortment wasn't to our liking as well as the quality of the food was not as good as it used to be. Since I only eat chicken, I was hoping for some chicken dishes. There was only one chicken item near the carving station, rotisserie chicken. And of course, that dish was empty. So we asked the guy behind the counter if there's more coming out...he replied that he has to cut up the pieces and then he'll put it out later. Well, I'm here now after waiting an hour in line...sorry to inconvenience you--isn't your job food prep!? Very annoying. So I basically paid $33 for cheese and crackers and some dried out desserts. Go to Planet Hollywood if you want a better assortment of food.  Our waiter was nice...",

The ambiance and decor is cute, made to look like you are actually dining in a French village. The service was prompt, and the food was varied from your usual buffet food. My boyfriend enjoyed the mussels, which he said were always the first items to disappear!   The best part of the buffet is the made to order crepe station. There usually is a line, but it does move pretty quickly. The crepes are delicious, and are definitely worth the wait!",

Their quiche, bread and other offerings are not very good replicas though.  2 years ago, they removed both braised short rib and the Chicken Coq au Vin. Now the best thing there remaining is their crepes made to order... which you can get at most good crepe shops.  Its worth the long lines every time I go to Vegas (been here over 7 times now).",

The wait can seem like an eternity if you're trying to get in before your 24 hour wristbands expire but in reality we waited 20 minutes on a Thursday am and 30 on Friday. We were told by the cashier if we had their Player's Club card we could have had $10 knocked off our wristband price. I loved the small village ambiance that continued all the way into each dinning area. Both our servers each morning were quick with the drinks and a shout out to our second server who tried her best to locate a keno runner from Bally's for me to place a bet. As for the actual food a must is the rosemary potatoes, eggs Benedict and varieties of sausages from a group consensus. I personally liked the loxs and bagels. The salmon was fresh and there was still tons of it even though we were close to lunch time. I almost never get it and filled up on it like this was my last meal. Oh and if possible try to sit on the outside of buffet seating. People watching is great fun and I actually felt like I was at a small French cafe instead of inside a money gobbling casino.",

I'm generally a light eater, so the concept of paying a premium for the opportunity to stuff food in my face by the pound and praise this All-American testament to culinary excess is not anything I aspire to, and yet, I can't separate it from the Vegas experience. Fortunately, Le Village Buffet is an honest cut above, perhaps the only buffet I've had in Vegas that didn't taste like a buffet, with the heat lamps and the rubbery food and pink slime and such. Choices are abundant, food is fresh, and really, it doesn't sit, since everyone is attacking all stations at all times. It's a pain in the ass getting in, and while a lot of recent reviews about declining quality give me pause, I will likely return next time I'm in LV to check for myself. Champagne makes it all go down better.",

This is definitely the place to go for breakfast or brunch. The only bad thing is that you're in Vegas and who the fuck wakes up before 11am? Well if you haven't gone to bed yet and you feel like the best breakfast buffet in town then you've come to the right place. This place has everything from custom crepes to eggs benedict. Just a great selection overall. The only issue I had was the damn crepe line, that shit was a 30 minute wait!  Besides that, the atmosphere is cool. It does its best to replicate a small french village with the tables in the center of the whole thing. The painting of the sky helps create a unique dining experience.

I will say, however, that of the 4 buffets I visited in Vegas on my last trip (Wynn, Bellagio, Aria being the other 3), it was 4th in line.  It just didn't stack up to the last 2 times I was there.  It's slipped a bit, to be honest.  The food choices overall was a bit skimpy compared to other lunch buffets (Aria, Mandalay, etc).  It's the only buffet I visited where it was pretty easy to get through all the choices and fill up your plate twice (or even once).  The choices just weren't as appealing.  The food also didn't appear that fresh (sorta warmed over looking).  That was odd to me b/c we were there on as Monday and fairly early (about 1130) so it's not like more than a few dozen ppl had even been through it.  The food was a bit \"dry\" in spots.    The positives were that overall, you'll leave full and fairly satisfied with the meat and other selections.  My wife really liked the sole very much! Also, the decor if you sit \"outside\", is pretty cool (although the painted \"cloud\" ceilings is overdone between Venetian, Planet Hollywood and the Paris- everyone does it and it's starting to look 90's, hokey and dated).  The crepe station I didn't take advantage of (just not my thing), although if you are into that, it did look pretty apealing.  A solid B-.  Down from an A- a few years ago.  Don't let it slip any further, Paris, or you'll be equal to a run of the mill (Treasure Island) type buffet.",

I have dinners in Le Village half of the times when I come to Las Vegas. The service is very good before. But not anymore! Not just this time. The services is going downhill at the last few years. This time it finally down to the point \"better than nothing\"! The waitress cannot be found most of the time. No body will refills your drinks until you lucky to see your waitress. The waitress does pick up the plates, but she looks overloaded. Never see a smile! Rush in, rush out!   The foods is also cut down a lots! It used to be reasonable good choice. But it is very limit of choice now due To they closed down one section of the buffet table.   The price of the buffet in Las Vegas is getting much higher. But the qualities of the buffets included Le Village is keeps getting lower. I have so many choices of restaurants or buffets in Las Vegas. This will be my last time to have the buffet at Le Village before they back to the buffet as what they are long time ago. I hope I will see the management at Le Village Buffet or Paris Las Vegas make this buffet becomes one of the best buffet in Las Vegas again!",

They no longer even bring you drinks, but that was no big to me (might be to others), the gal who cleared our plates was super sweet and nice.   The food sucked.  The crab was almost all empty, like full on empty shells laying on ice. People were digging searching for crab legs with actual meat (when you found one it was a pretty small amount of meat and not worth the effort).  I love a salad bar, and this was so basic. You can get better salad at freaking Sizzler. And sizzler is not $39.99!   I ended up eating potatoes and cold pasta salad b/c nothing was good. Potatoes and cold pasta salad do not warrant that price.  There are so many options in Vegas, do not bother with this one.",

I met to give 1 star but our waitress was very friendly.    Let's start w/ the food, that's the main attraction.  The food was okay, the variety is mostly Italian, soup and salads.  The best part should have been the crab legs but look at the pic.  The crab legs are tiny, a mess and previously frozen.  They were 'not good' not quite bad.  But why does it look like such a mess, though customers make it a mess it's ultimately the job of the staff to keep it clean.  I came here because of an online discount.  Because of the discount it's an ok deal, but for me I have to think of quality and spend a few extra at a better buffet.",

The manager made us wait more than half an hour just to speak to her and the funny thing was that  when she went to make a remark to her staff they would turn around and laugh about it expression of \"whatever\"  We noticed a short line going in for dinner now we know why. One of the vip staff there i mentioned to her About how could a take so long to see the manager and and her reply was she is busy and cannot talk to you. the people behind the food counters also very unprofessional",

We went at around 12 and all they had for breakfast was a little bit of left over eggs and some cold french toast.  There wasn't any meat or poultry except some chicken thighs   A lot of salad tho.

    "text": "A number of years ago my husband and I would go to Las Vegas and eat at the Bellagio breakfast buffet which we loved.  On one trip we was the the Le Village Buffet at Paris Las Vegas and I absolutely loved it.  The food was great...I loved the eggs benedict, they had fresh fruit including berries and the choices of food were incredible.  We have gone back several times and each time the buffet has gotten worse to the point that I probably will not go back again.    The one thing that was new this year was a beverage bar to get soda/coffee/juice, etc.  This would have been OK; however, I attempted to get a glass of skim milk which would have taken me forever as it came out super slow.  I asked an employee if he could refill the milk and he looked at it and said that it wasn't empty, just frozen (which didn't do me any good).  I did track down a manager and graciously went and got me a glass of milk.  OK...not a big deal but then came the food...honestly, very disappointing.  The eggs benedict are not make it yourself which is OK, but they used to be outstanding...definitely went way down in quality.  Again, the fruit selection has gone way down.  I used to enjoy a bowl of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries...blueberries and raspberries were no where to be found.    On a somewhat positive note, the cheese selection is nice and I did enjoy the pecan sticky buns; however, this is not enough to make me want to go back.  The crepe station is also good but on this visit there were very limited choices of crepes to choose from.  The food in general is OK, but for the price which continues to go up and seeing the quality go down, I don't think it is worth it.  Just my opinion!",

The bacon was horribly greasy and either burnt or undercooked. The sausage was a bit rubbery. Croissants were dry and not flaky.   Service was bad. I ordered coffee and got a carafe, no cup.

I went in knowing my options would be a bit more limited since I'm pescatarian. However, I knew there would be plenty of pasta options, and usually, pasta = a happy me! I did also find a tilapia option, which ended up being the best tasting food I had there.   I tried 3 different types of pasta - mac and cheese, a stuffed tortellini, and some sort of penne pasta in vodka sauce with shrimp. Now, on their website, they said one of the \"must try\" items is their truffle mac and cheese. I love anything with truffles in it, but I searched the whole buffet (which wasn't that big) and didn't find any truffle mac and cheese. They DID have regular mac and cheese, which wasn't great. The shredded blend of american and cheddar cheeses on top wasn't even melted yet, so that was kind of strange, and there was zero hint of truffle. Sad! Their vodka sauce penne pasta didn't taste like vodka sauce at all. The stuffed tortellini was alright, I guess... nothing special.   I was also very excited for their crepe station. I ordered a mushroom, spinach, and brie crepe, which sounded delicious. However, when I took it back to the table, only the outer edges of the crepe were hot. Everything else was cold inside. Also sad!   The desserts were decent. They had plenty of options for dessert - their macarons were pretty tasty and had a really good texture to them. I also enjoyed their soft serve chocolate custard.   All in all, I really wanted to like this buffet, but the food just really wasn't that great. I gave it a 2 though because the buffet itself is beautifully decorated and looks very visually appealing. Our server was nice too, and she checked on us several times, which was nice. I will be trying other buffets next time I'm in Vegas though!",

    "text": "Went for lunch during my vegas trip with my fiance and our friends who are also engaged. I went to this buffet with no expectations because I never really heard anything about it. However, to my surprise, the decor as well as the food exceeded my expectations. The decor was so cute and mimicked the streets and exteriors of French shops, boutiques, bakeries, etc. Loved the vibe of the buffet interior.  They had a handful of different stations. Compared to other more known buffets in LV, they lacked the variety of multicultural dishes but the quality of food was great and unique. Plus, the theme of the buffet is obviously Parisian theme so obviously they won't have the different ethnic foods. However, they do have some sushi rolls. I've never seen an LV buffet with a Crepe station (made to order). Yes crepes!!    I'll definitely be back .. even if it's just for the crepes.",

It was great!!!    Especially the salmon. It was soft, moist, pepper-y, and a little sweet (maybe from honey?). Totally divine. Perhaps one of the best pieces of salmon I ever had that wasn't cooked at home. My friends were impressed too. They all raved about the cream spinach. I didn't try it because I got distracted by all the other great food.   The desserts were good too.   I ate wayyyyy toooo much and left totally happy.",

    "text": "This is your typical breakfast buffet with the addition of crepes -  yum, yum!  Unfortunately, it was not as good as it used to be. We found that several things on the buffet were cold, the corned beef hash now has ground up corned beef where in the past it was pieces, the turkey bacon as sitting in water and there was very little fresh fruit available.    When we mentioned these things to the manager he did not seem to care.  He had a answer for everything from \"the turkey bacon is just an inferior product\" to \"we can't make any money if we put out better/more fruit and berries\".  It was very shocking.  All of this could have been OK if we would have had better service.  We were asked what we would like to drink when we paid (on the way in) and the drinks were delivered while we were getting our food.  I ordered hot tea with cream and I was given two Earl Grey teabags.  As I wanted plain black tea (i.e. English Breakfast) I tried to find our waiter to have the teabags changed out, but he was nowhere to be found.  I was half done with my first plate of food before he ever came out of the back.  We waved him down and I told him what I would like and he left the table without asking anyone else if they needed anything - and they did.  He returned with my teabags and one person asked for water and he turned to leave again without asking if there was anything else.  We grabbed him before he left, but I'm sure this is why he was not around - I saw him helping one person at a table at a time instead of helping the whole table.  They definitely need to do some training - for both their servers and management!!",

It isn't that the food is out of this world or that anything other than the Crepes stand out, but as far as buffets go it's probably one of the better ones I've been to. There's a great selection of food to choose from and they divide it up by nationality which is nice . As I mentioned the crepes are fantastic, and they also have a wonderful salad bar. Their dessert items are also very good which is to be expected in a playset supposedly specializes in French stuff.  It's fairly expensive, and probably not the best buffet in town, but if you find yourself at the Paris it's worth eating there once.",

The day before I came here, I had tried the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars Palace so obviously I ended up comparing the two (Bacchanal was $75).    Overall, it had everything one can expect on a buffet. There was a crepes station which I really enjoyed, seafood, meat, desserts etc. But in comparison to Bacchanal, it was just sad. Not only did Bacchanal provide much more options, but it was also much, much better quality food. I know that there was a huge  price difference so I took that into consideration, but even though I did, I don't think the food was worth $42.   The service and ambiance was honestly quite bad as well. We sat in a separate room of some sort and you could just tell the place was run down. It looked old, the wallpapers were dirty and it was dusty. It was just kind of a unattractive place to eat. The service was also so-so. No one ever came to clear our plates or refill our drinks.   While this buffet is cheaper, it kind of lives up to \"you get what you pay for\". There are so many great buffets in Vegas. I would definitely avoid this one and maybe pay a little extra $ if you can. It goes a long way!",

They make the inside look like the quartier francais, very quaint and the food classified by province.

I've put that word in quotations because I felt like I was eating something out of this world. It tasted so weird we couldn't decide if it was lime or pistachio. I will attach photographic evidence to this review and let the photo speak for itself!  We went around brunch/lunch time on a Friday and the service and overall feel of the place seemed pretty hectic. And there was only ONE WOMEN WASHROOM STALL for the entire buffet. Incredible.  Maybe I had high expectations because the line up going into the buffet was insanely long (actually out of the 4 buffets we ate at in Vegas, we had to wait the longest for Paris).  Not worth it.",

They have good sausages with sauerkraut which is one of my top picks. They also serve some seafoods like crabs,shrimps and mussels. You can have your omelet made in one of the food stations too. But the highlight of this buffet is the crepe station where you can choose from sweet crepes to gourmet crepes. I personally love the banana nutella crepe but my husband tried the caprese crepe and its really good. If you want to have your crepe fast,choose the Asian guy for he is efficient and fast. Lastly,another great thing here is that you can have unlimited mimosas available upto 3pm but if you don't fancy that their cranberry juice is good too. So take time to savor every dish that this buffet has to offer and don't be afraid to try each of them. Just make sure you are super hungry to set your stomach to the scrumptious meal you will have here.",

    "text": "We took a spontaneous trip to Vegas towards the end of September to commit some gluttony, fully armed with a couple of Groupon deals we found for Le Village (inside Paris) & the Spice Market (Planet Hollywood) buffets.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/spice-market-buffet-las-vegas#hrid:1QcL6C8Ik11As2dojg5xXw\">yelp.com/biz/spice-marke...</a>  From past experiences, there was always a long wait for the Le Village buffet, so I decided to see if they take reservations and to my surprise, they actually do!  We were seated rather quickly and the place didn't seem to be as busy as they were in the past (thus the Groupon deal I assume) This particular deal included a bottle of wine of Chard, Cab or Merlot. Unlike the deal at the Spice Market, which offered Miller beer (WTH?), I thought a bottle of wine is a bit classier, so I opted for Merlot. Not wanting to be drunk at lunch time, I was happy to learn though they were required to open the bottle, it was a screw cap and we're allowed to take the rest when we leave.  Considering it was a screw cap and a freebie, it actually wasn't too bad. As for the food, the selection was not nearly as plentiful as say Rio, or Studio B (M Hotel) but the quality was evident. Their prime rib was perfect, red, slight bloodiness and had a nice seasoned crust with just the right amount of fat. That was the highlight. All other dishes were very good also. The items were well stocked and kept hot.   The crepes were amazing as each was big enough to fill me up. Their dessert selection was much more impressive than the Spice Market (95% cupcakes) Le Village offered macarons, which is very appropriate for being inside Paris. But the one that were served like a lollipop (on a stick) were dry and crumbly, and tasted stale.   Overall, it was a better experience than when I went many years ago. Perhaps since they weren't swamped like before, the quality of food and service didn't suffer.   Tip: Go to Open Table to make a reservation & also earn points. When you arrive, proceed to the VIP line and avoid the usual long line to get in. What an awesome discovery!  You're welcome!",

We would wait at least 10 min to get refills on any drinks or even to get our plates cleared but when anyone showed up they were very nice.   I loved loved the selection of cheese. They were pretty much everywhere but some areas I wish there was something to eat w the cheese. Perhaps I am used to eating cheese with crackers or even a selection of cold cut meats would help.   The desserts that were present were yummy and I have no complaints.   The thing that frustrated me the most was out table was uneven. It kept wobbling and literally I'm surprised no cups fell to the ground.  I would recommend this place to go eat but keep in mind it's mostly French inspired foods.",

Nothing looked fresh and most the selections looked like it came from a can or package. The salad bar looked sloppy and unappetizing. I had the lamb at the carving station and it was grey and tough and tasteless. I then tried a tri tip and took considerable force to cut into it. The dessert are good and the crepe station is the only reason Im giving this place two stars instead of one. Thumbs down.",

Not buffet food by any means.The concept of showcasing different regions of France was great and it was just an excellent experience. We used a Groupon here, but I would easily come back without it.  Main course: tasty duck, juicy lamb leg cuts and pre-cut crab legs Dessert: Creme brulee was amazing and so was tiramisu and macaroons.  The reason I cannot give this 5 stars: Service left much to be desired. Took a long time for the waitress to bring us water and wine. Again, the food was so good that even the lacking service would still make me come here.",

There was an okay selection but nothing out of the ordinary. The highlight was probably the crepes, but even then the crepes you can get at Jean Philippe is so much better. The macaroons were so stale and the rest of the desserts didn't really taste that great.  The environment is probably the best thing about the buffet because it looks really cool and unique from all the other buffets. Still probably not a good enough reason to pay so much for only subpar food.   Customer service was very friendly and nice.  Overall, just splurge a bit more and go to Bachannal or the Wynn to enjoy a great buffet in Vegas. How often do you get to go to Vegas?",

You're in the heart of the city , entertainment capital of the world, a leader in the culinary industry. The design of the buffet itself is absolutely gorgeous, making you feel like your outside in a village of France. And it's as far as it gets with it's positivity. The blame here goes on the chef himself/herself. Food is not consistently taken care of making it crust on top, and was not maintained too hot. The selections are varied but the flavors are okay. The waitress we had was quite rude and seemed to always be rushing for us to leave as closing time was approaching in 40 minutes. It is a very sad and heartbreaking experience to be quite honest, with such a beautiful hotel right in the heart of vegas having a mediocre experience. Paris wows you with it's eiffel tower , painted ceilings beautiful decor inside , and is truly crushing the buffet doesn't keep up the standard. Paris was truly a beautiful escape where accordion players would once greet you as you'd walk through the casino. Slowly but surely they have been cutting back a lot for who knows why and the buffet is a victim of this crime. Please go back to how it was, a magical escape, not hey let's go to that average buffet located outside the mall next to the highway",

Yet another meal in Vegas where you'll wait in line to get in for no damned good reason:  plenty of available tables, and yet a handful of hostesses who shuffle back and forth doing nothing in particular, looking at a computer console at the hostess station, ignoring parties waiting to be seated, then shuffling off again.  It was about 2:15 in the afternoon.  We paid $30 for the \"champagne brunch\" that was running until 3 p.m.  The crowd was dwindling; there were many open tables, but we still waited (why?) for the indifferent hostesses to shuffle over and be bothered to seat us.  We were well into eating what we'd collected from the buffet on our first trip through before a waitress came by to take drink orders.  They don't bring you water unless you order it.  Food was pretty good, by my estimation.  I got a decent slab of prime rib; not too rare, not too fatty, yet still tender.  Mussels were slightly overcooked, but overall capably done.  The potatoes au gratin had just been refreshed as I arrived; and they were excellent.  The crepe bar was good enough, though the crepe itself was a bit flavorless and tasted as though it had come from a boxed mix.  Vegetables near the prime rib station could have used another minute of cooking, but were respectable.  The crab legs were fresh and still plump and appetizing.  Pasta dishes were a little mushy and overcooked.  The mini creme brulees were a pleasure, with flecks of real vanilla bean and a tasty, crisp, caramelized sugar crust.  The fruit selection at the salad bar was disappointing and thin.  But the service really needs to wake the hell up to be worth $30.  A waitress had just brought us refills of Pepsi before we got up to make our 2nd run through the buffet.  We deliberately put our flatware off to one side so that whoever was collecting our empty plates would leave it alone.  When we got back, plates, flatware, and Pepsis were all gone.  Yes, somebody had taken away our freshly-refilled sodas.  Why?  Beats me.  Our original waitress had gone off shift while we were at the buffet for Round 2, and the new one could not be less interested in bringing us replacement flatware.  There are no place settings or utensils available on the buffet, just plates.  So we rummaged in some drawers in a buffet storage/credenza in the dining room behind us, and grabbed our own forks and knives.",

Yes, they have some edible things - the mac and cheese is pretty good  (hard to screw up mac and cheese), the soup du jour was a lobster bisque and it was perfect. However the prime rib was very dry and hard to chew, the potatoes au gratin looked very unappetizing. Worst of all- the macarons!!! I got excited when I saw macarons in the dessert section only to be extremely disappointed when I bit into one- very flaky, air bubbles inside, way too sweet and turns into a chewey clump in your mouth. I just couldn't believe they get away with calling this stuff macarons. Oh, and the service was very slow, my husband said the slow service is the only thing that reminds him of France. $32 per person is so not worth it.",

The food was good but there was no dish that really stood out for me. I would probably put this buffet in the middle of the pack along with the Mirage and Monte Carlo. FYI: The secret to getting both the breakfast and lunch foods is to stay in line at around 1020 am. Hopefully you will reach the end by 11 am and that's when the fresh lunch food will be served but you will have paid the cheaper breakfast price instead.",

The food was delicious and there was plenty of it. I can't imagine anyone making it through all the selections available. Please save room for dessert, I should have started here. I had the lunch buffet and the price is on the high end for Vegas buffets (but you are at the Paris) but worth the extra dollars to make sure you get good food. Very little wait but we were there on a weekday. As you pay for your meal you are asked if you want to add an additional amount for drinks. Do this if you are going to be drinking alcohol as more than one glass can pay for it. Dress was casual for lunch.",

    "text": "This used to be one of the top two or three buffets in Vegas. While it's still good, it's starting to feel the effects of downsizing the number of options it serves, and I can't quite put it in the same tier as the buffets at Caesar's, Bellagio, or Wynn.  What they serve is usually pretty good. I remember they did a tri-tip one night that was absolutely excellent, and their prime rib never disappoints. They also get points for a very good dessert section.  If you get the Buffet of Buffets deal (which I'd advise; if you eat at more than one buffet in 24 hours, it pays for itself), or are just in the neighborhood, this is a pretty solid lunch or dinner option (haven't eaten breakfast here, so I can't comment on that). Unfortunately, it used to be GREAT, and it isn't anymore.",

I am usually staying nearby or right here in Paris or Bally's so its convenient, but its also pretty good and with your card you get a discount.  I have purchased the 24 hour buffet pass and have come in here just to get those beautiful Macarons.  I feel that bumps up my making it worth it factor for just a snack, but you have to hit it just right when there isn't a line.  This place is pretty busy and if you aren't staying here or nearby you might not get the opportunity to just walk in and have to wait a bit in line but the food is worth it.  The quality is higher than some other buffets on the strip but there is something for everyone and there is no way your leaving hungry.  If you want to enjoy the unlimited mimosas thats only an extra $12 so drink up and get your tipsy on too while you enjoy some freshly prepared (just for you) crepes and chill out with your macarons too. Thats what I did.  I will certainly be back again when I am in town.",

Not a lot of variety of food. I had 3 plates of food and came back with almost the same stuff. Prime rib is great - when is prime rib ever not? Do NOT get the \"mashed potatoes\". They're only semi-mashed..they're all mushed slices of potatoes.   The sushi bar isn't so great. There were only about 3-4 kinds of sushi, which weren't so great. I loved the shrimp & cocktail bar, all the shrimps just lying there. Also, get the crab legs, they're fresh! The BEST part about the buffet was the crepe section. There's a long line for it but well worth the wait. The crepes are good, and you get to choose as much fillings as you want. Really nice lady behind the counter.   And by the way, what's with people not leaving tips? At least leave a dollar for God's sakes, seeing that there are waiters there who clean up your mess. My waiter was so nice, very energetic, despite that he seemed old, but had my plates off the table once I've finished, so huge props to him!

They call this French food? Where's the smell of butter, where are the homemade pastries, what's up with the peasant uniforms and why are they serving pita bread, but not one French fry is in sight. In short, this buffet lacks authenticity and bang for your buck. For the price head to Red Rock, Caesars or even the Cosmo.  The line was about 100 suckers long at 9 p.m and they close at 10. When we finally got a table the food lacked freshness and the entire buffet seemed like it was closing. Tables were open all over the place, btw. For $33.50 a person I'd expect for them to at least turn up the damn lights; everything seemed covered in a haze and I wasn't even drunk. Only buffet I walked the length of and came up empty.   It was mostly shellfish, but the carving station offered turkey breast and dry roast beef. The sides of Brie Mac and Cheese and Cavatapi Pasta were delicious, but who goes to a buffet for that? They had single servings of Beef Bourguignon (pot roast), which were good, but again where was the good stuff? The salad bar had a overly dressed Caesar salad that tasted as if they forgot to wash the lettuce.  Lastly, the buffet lacked variety, they had sushi, but not one PIZZA? They offered cold apple pie, but no petit fours! Cheap yogurt out of a machine, but no freshly made ice cream? Bread rolls, but no croissants.  Turkey gravy, but no hollandaise! I didn't leave hungry, because I'm a trooper, but I definitely will never go back or recommend to any of my friends.  For a country famed for their food and a company that just spent millions re-doing Caesars buffet I thought I a great dinner was in order. Wrong!",

Lovely atmosphere, good service.  The menu is always great, breakfast includes the usual staples as well as fancy eggs benedict, delicious pastries, lots of unusual sausages, even prime rib hash. The famous crepe station is busier than ever in the morning and is delicious!  The lunch is even better with lots of heartier foods, including some divine tri tip grilled steak bits which rivalled the roast beef and prime rib. Le Village has some of the most delicious Yukon mashed potatoes I've ever eaten - they're REAL potatoes and are richly golden in color, so buttery and creamy, you'll love 'em.  The crepe station is fabulous, offering several options for a filling - we tried the Brandy Apples with Caramel sauce (with a huge helping of fresh whipped cream on top) and the Bananas Foster with a drizzling of chocolate sauce. I'd pay $15 just for one of these and a cup of coffee out in the real world! Don't miss it!",

I give it more points though because there were more unusual items and I found some things I really liked. Still though, at 25 it's not a bad one to go to. I found enough things to make my tummy happy anyways.  Sunday night I waited about 45 minutes to get in. Their line is situated right in front of their buffet with a good view of the inside. So you can kinda see what the place looks like and all. Basically looks like the rest of Paris, so I was kinda excited to be able to eat in a cute quaint \"Parisian\" atmosphere. Ok so i've never been to Paris, but ya get what I'm talking about. Unfortunately I was shunted off to the side room near the bathroom so that just left the eating part to indulge in.  The stations are all divided into certain areas of Paris with slightly different themes, the dessert station is smack in the middle near the fruit and salad and crab legs station. The best things were the snow crab legs, and the crepes. I don't particularly like king crab legs since they tend to be drier and less flavorful. Snow crab legs are smaller and more work, but I think worth it. They cut slits in the legs here so it wasn't that hard to crack and the meat pulled right out. I really could've eaten so much of this but I didn't want to fill up tooo much. Crepes were made to order, fruity dessert crepes made in a weird location though. Right inbtwn dinner food and not at the dessert area. You picked the stuff inside, they make it, then you top it off with whatever you like. Whipped cream, nuts, fudge, caramel and other things.  There were other things that were pretty decent, but not excellent. At the end I noticed that they had a crayfish dish! I had seen the dish before, but no crayfish since someone prolly picked them all out. Boo...I would've loved to just eat those. Plenty of veggies here also, cooked in several different ways. A cheese platter area, and different types of bread. Desserts were decent, the mini fruit tart was tasty. Brownies too.  Good priced buffet for what you get. Hehe I might come back just to ransack the crayfish dish.",

    "text": "Le village buffet dessert has a 33% acceptable rating per Jon. The creme brulee was at least brulee'd here; however the creme lacked body and flavor. Cheese cake was the usual central kitchen fail. The eclaire was stale and creme was the same failed concoction in most of their desserts. The only acceptable dishes offered was their macaroons and flan. Macaroons were soft and moist with good flavor. Flan had body and was covered in light simple syrupy that doesn't over power the flan. This concludes the dessert review of le village buffet",

The ambience of this French themed buffet reminded me of Beauty and the Beast. Unlike most fluorescent lighted buffets, this buffet is beautifully decorated. It's like eating in a French village under a lovely clear blue sky.   The food is good and a step above traditional buffet foods. The roast beef and prime rib were both wonderful. The crepe station is awesome! What could be better than a fresh made crepe?!?   At $30 for dinner, it's a little pricey but what buffet in Vegas isn't anymore? Next time, I'll be sure to take advantage of the $45 all-you-can-eat in 24 hours deal, which included six buffets in the Harrah's family of casinos.",

I waited maybe 15 minutes, and it was well worth it.  I ordered a savory crepe with mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan and a sweet crepe with Nutella and bananas.  Then pretending I was a food artist I paired the savory crepe with salad and smoked salmon.  I then got some fresh strawberries to accompany my sweet crepe.  Both crepes were delicious!  Since we were here a little before 11 a.m. (the latest time for breakfast prices), they also started to change the breakfast dishes out for lunch items.  The only lunch items I tried were the sushi and seaweed salad.  Both were pretty good, but nothing special.    If you're in the mood for all-you-can-eat crepes, Le Village is a winner!  The ambiance will also make you feel like you are dining in a charming Parisian courtyard.",

It's kind of nice how they have the tables spread out into different patios/buildings that reflect a little Parisian village.  The food was average, but not disappointing. The only two things I was sad about was that the 1st serving of eggs Benedict had an egg that had been cooked all the way through (due to the heat lamp) but since it's a buffet I just got another and it was fine.  The other thing that bugged me was that there Corned Beef Hash was made by simply using shredded Hash Browns as an ingredient. Just seemed like a lazy move to me. The next day I had Corned Beef Hash next door at Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis, and they were perfectly prepared and cooked with poached eggs on top! So I recommend going next door for that :)  The Croissants were soft inside yet crunchy on the outside, so good!",

Wait was about 20 minutes still but the staff were kind and accommodating of our 1 wheelchair. Price was about $30 per person, dinner rate. Food was fairly decent, they refilled often and there was plenty to try from. The spread is kind of random, there's no real order to what goes where (minus the desserts in center), you do sort of have to walk the whole buffet to see what's where. Our server was very good once she eventually got to us-they were very understaffed and she was literally running back and forth to her tables. They offer hot crab legs which was a plus!",

I understand things happen and their bakery didn't send them any macaroons this morning, etc,  but I would at least expect an apology of some sort.  It was also a little ridiculous that almost half of the stations were either unlabeled or mislabeled.  The food was barely adequate, obviously low quality and not fresh.  The only thing that gave it the second star was the ambiance - absolutely beautiful French village, lovely.",

They do make FRESH hot crepes here, which are in fact very yummy!!! The line however, is very long... I suggest getting in line when you fill like you may be starting to fill up because by the time you get your food, you will be hungry again!! LOL. I got 2 crepes, as did most people because the line is so long, you might as well get 2 crepes. I got a sweet and savory crepe. There is a menu board that list the types of crepes available, but you can order a custom one if you want. They will make whatever crepe you want within reason. I got a banana nutella one and for my savory, a chicken with asparagus. Both were flavorful and delicious!! Right outside the buffet is a crepe place... charging $10.50 a crepe... my 2 crepes already covered the cost of breakfast, $20 here! LOL.  I think next time I would try lunch or dinner to see if it's really as good as I remembered since I think the crepes are offered all day. I was thinking it was just breakfast so that's why I had breakfast here. Breakfast tasted better than average. There was a good variety and the mini waffles were just so cute! A lot of sausage variety also and at least 3 types of potatoes that I saw! I didn't like the potato triangles as they were too dry, but the hash browns were good and so were the sliced potatoes (can't remember what it's called)  When I left, it had switched over to lunch, but I was too full already to go try lunch. Fresh crepes is why this place deserves a 4 star!  This was the only buffet we had to wait it... about 30 minutes. This is also the only buffet that you can make a reservation with via open table. I did not try that, so I'm not sure how well that works...",

    "text": "We're in Vegas.. Do a Buffet. We're in the Paris hotel, might as well do theirs, right?  So we looked up the price on line, Cool! $25  head.. Not so cool.. $35 a head when we get to the registers. Weekend pricing in effect. *FacePalm*     We had a wheelchair in our party and when the seating girl came to us, she admonished us for being in the wrong line.  No one told us differently. There were no signs and the register girl didn't tell us otherwise either, so I'm not sure how we were supposed to intuit where we were to go. Her tone was rude and snippy.  However, we didn't have to wait long for a seat, we were shown quickly to a place close to the food and seated.   The first thing I noticed? The overwhelming stink of seafood. To me, it turns my stomach. I'm certain to others \"fresh fish & seafood\" smells great, but it made me want to throw up.  But I put that aside as we all took our seats and the majority of our party went to get in line and serve themselves up some food.   There were MANY Selections. Everyone came back with something different, something good. For me, My first stop was the salad bar. I chose a Caprese salad and a bowl of some of the best potato leak soup I've ever had the pleasure of eating. It was made with real cream, and you can tell the difference that makes.  The Caprese salad was good, but there wasn't any basil left on the plate. *sad* I had a small green salad too, but the grilled chicken I chose to go with it, was awfully dried out.  For my main course, I chose steamed veggies, some potatoes augratin, sauteed mushrooms, Prime rib that was a bit over done, grilled lamb, taziki sauce and some parmesan flat bread.  The food was, for the most part, well done and very tasty.   Dessert was a bit of a challenge, but I looked through the options and chose to have my first Macaroon, a Macaroon tart with black berries, a Creme caramel & a lemon tart. I wasn't impressed with the green macaroon. The Macaroon tart with black berries was FABULOUS. The creme caramel (Aka flan) Was ok, and the lemon tart was.. no, there was no lemon, it was a pastry shell with meringue. GROSS.    So for the most part, the buffet would have been fine at $25, but so not worth the extra money, especially if you don't eat from the sushi and raw bar, which none of us did... As one of my party said \"I wanted to try the sushi but it doesn't look fresh or healthy\"",

We waited about a good 45 minutes or so..and the customer service was great!  We were seated in kind of a dark cornered area which was kind of lame, but at least we were to ourselves.  The food? Tasty. Small buffet, but good food nonetheless. They had their Mediterranean area, seafood, breakfast items, dessert bar, omelette and crepe makers, etc.  Not gonna lie..all of the food I got..DELICIOUS.  Got me some grilled chicken that was juicy and flavorful, tasty roasted potatoes, AMAZING yukon gold mashed taters, and this creamy truffled pasta they had? Omg. I pretty much filled my second plate with just that lol.  They had brioch french toast which was just okay. It was moist, but meh.  Sadly, their desserts..allll blah. I didn't like any of them. Creme brulee was kind of chunky-ish..macarons just looked horrible. White chocolate chip cookies..so dry, and when I bit into them, it just broke apart into 4 pieces. Disappointing desserts, but tasty main meals.",

The cart made an inordinate amount of noise with dishes loaded on it and we could not hear each other talk.

I suggest making a reservation or you'll be waiting awhile especially if you go on a weekend day.   Service was great when we were actually being attended but not a big deal since it is a buffet, you can pretty much expect that.   Definitely worth a visit if you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "I haven't done many buffets in Vegas. I'm too into food I think. It's a problem. However, my friend's dad swore by this buffet in Paris.   I'm still not big into buffets, but I'll give my review.   $24 for the buffet and $11 for bottomless drinks. If you gamble, just save the $11 and go sit at a table or slots. You'll have a couple of mediocre drinks and be on your way. Plus, we waited in line for 15-20 minutes so you tend to want to eat and go about your day.   You've got food from all over the world. This is their theme or attractiveness. I had nothing that surprised me with pleasantness.   I'd recommend getting small portions at each station so you can taste a variety. My friend didn't do this and ended up having one tall hodgepodge of a plate. Plus, you might as well taste it all incase something does entice your tastebuds.   The seafood is supremely overcooked. The mussels had the consistency of smoked oysters. The clams were stuck like chuck to the shell and if you pry them out, you'll end up chewing some shell. Woof.   The meat was tough and dry. And overcooked.   Get some cocktail shrimp. That's a safe good thing.   There was a station that was savoit (something like that, sorry), and the veggies were ok. There was a tomato salad that was also very ok. It could have used more reduced balsamic reduction.   This is all a reach. It wasn't good. This did not turn my dislike of buffets around.",

We paid around $52 for two of us and the also have $12 all you can drink bloody Marie's, mimosa, beer, and wine add on.  The food is fresh and varied. We were there for lunch and had shrimp, but no crab. There were several quintessential French dishes - bouillabaisse, choucroute, crepes, mussels, and cassoulet.  The cheese offering was disappointing and the bread and croissant, lackluster. They had pate, but no mousse.  The French onion soup, prime rib, creamed spinach, and sauteed mushrooms were exquisite! The coffee was fresh and strong and the creme brulee delicious.  They had macaroons, which would have been great on their own, but they were sandwiched  around ridiculously sweet custard of sort and that ruined them.  The restaurant is clean and the service was fine. One of our favorite buffets in Vegas and make it a point to always visit.",

    "text": "Totally unimpressed with Le Village Buffet!  Ate here during the holidays last year, and it was a 4 out of 5 star when the food was a little above average.  Visited here on Father's Day with a friend from SC and my brother and sister-in-law in hopes of celebrating Father's Day.  BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!!  The hostess sat us at a table near the desserts, which we did not choose.  The duck, prime rib were so bland and dry!  I had to dress it up over and over before it was up to decent edible flavor. :( I was in total disbelief as to how disappointing the meat was.  I was so turned off, that nothing else seemed up to par except for the Crepe's.  It saved the day!  I had the banana-nutella.  But, now that the crepe shop opened up across from the buffet, the buffet should now be shut down, sealed & condemned because it shouldn't cost  $33.55 for a good crepe.    Service was definitely a MINUS -5 stars.  Servers were dazed and not helpful with ingredients when asked.  My brother had seen tables around us getting their frozen crab legs steamed, so he got a plate full of crab legs and asked the server where to get them steamed.  He instructed him to have the waitress take them to the steamer.  When he asked the waitress, she said our table was for 7Diamond card holders only, and that we were mistakenly seated in the area where only the 7Diamond card holders are seated, and that in no way was she allowed to steam our crab legs.  The manager was requested, and arrived with an attitude before he even spoke. Since we were mistakenly seated in the wrong area, he was going to reprimand the hostess.  No compensation for the customer or apology!  As manager, he could have at least appeased my brother (on Father's Day) and steamed just this once since it was their mistake and not ours that we were seated in the 7Diamond area...?!!  Wth..?  Voices got loud, but the manager clearly was unable to manage his hot temper and proceeded to call security to have us removed.  Asked for our money back and were ignored.    PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BYPASS THIS MONSTROSITY OF A PIG STY!    Am I upset?  You bet!!  Go to The M, Bellagio or South Point, you'll be glad you did!  There's a definite disconnect among the hostess, servers, waitress & the unqualified manager who definitely needs more training.",

They have seafood, crab legs, carving stations, salad bar, large dessert section.Their pasta infused with truffle was delicious. The desserts were great too! Highly recommend this place for the taste me value, it's on the cheaper end for buffets. Wish we had more room in our belly and time to try more food.",

They created a fake line up while inside were tons of tables that were available. The choice of food were very limited and croissants were cold and hard. The place is very short staff as we only got our plates picked up twice during the entire buffet. Ladies Restroom is out of maintenance too so we had to go outside. The men restroom was so dirty. The only thing that is okay quality is the made to order crepe, but even that, the strawberries and bananas that go inside the crepes were all pre-syrup so they all taste soggy and too sweet. For that price should definitely go to other buffets instead. Oh one more thing started charging a four year old while all other buffets starts at five years old. Won't come back again for sure.",

As the table was just past 2 private Dining rooms, 2 Servers took care of me & we enjoyed a friendly chat.   Ambiance was just right.    All the Soups were rich & definitely French.  The Cioppini was my favorite ~ it was full of tasty seafood.  The Prime Rib was well seasoned & very tender.    The Crepe Chef was amazing!  He turned them out perfectly, cooking 2 @ a time.

The staff here is friendly and welcoming and the food variety was plenty but filled with lots of pork in every item. We got the freshly made crepes which they offer in sweet and savory forms that were good as well as the Omlette station. The hash browns were dry like they had been sitting in the chafing dish for awhile. They had lots of bread choices with butter, some pancakes, french toast but all the other dishes had some form of bacon mixed in ughh. The coffee here is extremely bitter and strong which I don't like buy hey if you do you will love it.   We had gotten the 24ht buffet pass and really didn't think it was worth the quality of the food they offered at the 5 buffet spots. In my opinion, buy yourself a nice plate of food at the many celebrity chef restaurants and you will be far more pleasantly pleased. Quality over quantity my friends.",

Get the CREME BRULEE, available only at lunch. King crab legs at dinner. Cioppino with mussels, clams and scallops was my mom's fave.  Crepe station is awesome.

I ate here out of desperation because this was what was close and was available at the Paris Hotel.  Basically the reviews are correct, crabs were bad quality with very little meat.  No fish entrees and the rest of the food was blah.  Read all the reviews and follow the consistent remarks that have been stated about what you get here.  It is way to expensive to get mediocre and less level food. Boohoo, I should have listened.",

    "text": "I came here once a couple of years ago and LOVED this place. Good food, good service, and a wonderful theme (it's Paris, of course it looks beautiful). Unfortunately, it seems to have gone average with some of the service. More so unfortunate because we came here for my brother's 18th bday dinner and were treated quite poorly.   The food was still pretty good so I can't complain too much there. Large selection and variety of meats, pastas, seafood, salads, dessert (yes they have creme brulee and macarons!), and a bar if you'd like alcoholic drinks as well. While Certain items were super flavorful, others were on the bland side-you can't have it all.   The downside: The service was...underwhelming.  We did see our server to refill our drinks a couple times, however, he was so rushed we could barely understand what he was saying. Of course, we still smiled and said thank you. He was definitely hard to track down and whenever we did need refills, it took a while to find him and an even harder time to get him to come over. (Our table was in an awkward spot, so I understand that, but it Seemed that way for the other tables around us as well). Of course we didn't need too much from our waiter seeing as it is a Buffet, but after this birthday fiasco, I had a hard time wanting to leave a t  If you'd like to read more of a personal story of what happened, Let me explain: I understand buffets don't really do anything too special for birthdays, but I asked my server if he had a candle and he quickly walked away rudely saying, no we don't have anymore. To me that means that you did...but you're too lazy to ask for any. So...I asked a different lady up front and go figure, she had a bunch of colored candles and said my server should've had some, is supposed to bring us the candle and light it. (She also said he would sing...but it's fine. We can do that ourselves).  Our server comes back and is shocked I have a candle sitting on top of one of the desserts. I ask him for a lighter and he just says, no I don't have one. I quickly explain that that's fine, but the lady up front told me to ask my server. He responds rudely with: \"well I don't, so What do you want me to do?\"  Wow. First off, don't give me attitude. Next, it would be nice if you could find the answer, or see if someone else has one. Three, I DID get a lighter from the same ladies up front. Not sure if it's a server issue or if they don't have very good communication within the buffet. Needless to say, our waiter never showed up at our table after that and, of course, Did not bring us the tea we ordered more than 10 minutes before this.   Got to talk to a manager up front, but Not entirely sure if I'll be back after the night we had.  2 stars for food and the ladies who helped me up front.",

Wish there was more options on what you could put in your omelette, but overall it was great! I was disappointed at the bread by the oatmeal. It was so hard to eat because it seemed old. The rest of the buffet was okay. The food selection was vast as they had crepe (sweet or savory), area to make an eggs benedict, and you can get slices of ham. Our server was incredibly nice and always checked on us. She was so sweet and always attentive to our needs.   Overall, only okay for me as I tried most of the top buffets here in Las Vegas. It's not bad, it's decent. I can definitely come back again if we pass by it as it was an affordable $21 per person for breakfast. Lunch and Dinner are different prices.",

Moreover, I had a VIP pass so I was able go to a separate entrance and not wait in line.  Our first meal here was a dinner.  It was ok, but nothing truly exceptional.  The prime rib was excellent and the other options were adequate.  Server was attentive, and eating in one of the rooms was quaint.  Breakfast was exceptional.  The slabbed bacon truly would melt in your mouth and was one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I had multiple pieces of it.  The other breakfast options were equally quite tasty.  My wife enjoyed her crepe immensely.  Overall, the dinner was average but the breakfast was fantastic.  I would visit again but based on the quality of the Total Rewards dining options I'd question purchasing the Buffet pass again.",

Crab legs are skinny and very thin. No more truffle Mac. Less variety of steamed clams and mussels. Only three types of crepes. Workers look like they hate their job and it shows in the quality of service.  They went from one of my favorites to easily one of the worst, what a shame.  Over the years, competing buffets have increased their prices due to inflation (as expected) but this buffet never increased their price. They instead decided to downgrade their quality.

EFFF, I got sent to a claustrophobic room with an Asian Chinese family with two kids who screamed with high pitches, ran around, and just caused mayhem. I kept looking but the parents did not care.  The food I tried this time: Snow crab, pork loin with apples and prunes, prime rib, au jus, paella, bouillabaisse, choucroute garni (variety of sausages with sauerkraut, from the Alsace-Lorraine region, close to the German border), andouille sausage, sweet cream crepes, mixed berries, creme brulee, bananas foster, choc ice cream, waffle cone and cream.   Food is as expected, but some shellfish from the paella were not fresh. How do I know? They did not open when cooked. I have evidence to back this assertion.  I wasn't too thrilled this time around, so that means I have to try other buffets on my next trip.",

However, I love the variety.  Le Village Buffet is located in Paris Las Vegas. Naturally, having my friend who is an expert at timing when you should go to a buffet, she recommended going at 11 am. It allows you to plop down for both breakfast and lunch foods.  There is a wait before you get seated. It is organized, thankfully. We waited for about half an hour.  We were there for three hours. I loved my breakfast items. I am perfectly happy getting pancakes and sausage. Anything else is a bonus.  Being at a Parisian-themed casino, I will devour chocolate croissants. They are my favourite. They were buttery and perfect.  My friend overdid the crepes. I love crepes, but she brought back three different flavours and expected me to split them with her. I would have been happy with splitting one with her and sampling more of what this buffet had to offer. We had salmon, chocolate, and tomato cheese crepes. They were all good, but I loved the chocolate crepe the best. Yes, I was on a chocolate kick. It's one of my favourite food groups.  I enjoyed having quiche, too. I don't see that as a typical buffet item often, so I had to get it. It was delicious.  Service was a bit slow. It does get busy, so pack your patience.  I enjoyed eating at this buffet. I would do it again when I am back here.  (167)",

Very little seafood choices and they no longer have the pizza or kid friendly dishes Expect to wait at least an hour in line each time. The highlight of this buffet are the crepes, so if you go here make sure you try them, they are delicious!!",

    "text": "For a buffet in Vegas - this one is A-Ok!  We were gifted with a 24 hour pass to this (and a few others) buffet and knew we had to stop in for a least one meal - considering we were staying at the Paris hotel. Here are the takeaways:  Pro's: ++ Tons of options to choose from! Each station had a variety of offerings like; Italian lasagna, heaping piles of shrimp scampi, salad bar with endless toppings, freshly carved roast beef, chicken and seafood, an entire sushi station and more! Everything and anything you could crave, is here! ++ FRESH in taste! Normally buffets make a bit wary, considering it's hard to know how long the food has been sitting out, but this one did not disappoint! ++ Plenty of seating options - for parties large or small! ++ Water, soda, coffee and tea are complimentary! Cocktails are offered as well - for a small price. ++ Prime location and decor inside Paris. The \"outdoor\" setting creates an intimate and unique feel!  Con's: -- Service is insanely slow and understaffed. The entire place was packed and there were only 3 waitress's refilling waters and clearing plates :/ -- PACKED, like line-out-the-door packed. There always seems to be line for breakfast, lunch or dinner, so be prepared. -- The space was pretty dirty. A ton of tables were left unbussed with crumbs on the floor - creating not the best looking space. -- Normal pricing for all you can eat is $24/person. If we didn't have free passes, not sure this would have been worth it.  While this place was convenient and tasty at the time, I'm not entirely sure we'd make a special trip back!",

    "text": "I expected a buffet in a nicer Las Vegas casino to be better than the buffets that are cheaper and in smaller casinos than in the Seattle area, but I think my expectations may have been a bit too high!  Once we actually found the buffet, having reservations made getting a table a breeze. If you're hellbent on trying this buffet like I was, I would suggest making a reservation from their website. It uses OpenTable and doesn't cost anything, you pay for your meal when you get there and you get to use the VIP entrance to the side of the buffet... which they should mention in their reservation process.  The concept of this buffet is very charming and intriguing, I wanted to explore each station as it represents a region in France. You'd have a hard time finding much that was actually a French dish but I understand that they cater to wider audience. Nonetheless, I wanted to spend our money there.  When it came to the actual food, that was a bit of a disappointment. Most of what I had on my plate was lukewarm. Even soups being held at the buffet bar were lukewarm. Any dish that included a protein severely lacked in that protein. For example, their chicken lemon artichoke rice pilaf had wonderful flavor but very little chicken. Same goes for their paella, lots of great rice but very little seafood. Their portions of prime rib and other roasted meats were slivers of what their website shows. Also that station's carver was almost rude in her demeanor when she served you, didn't listen to you, just put something on your plate whether you asked for it or not. I don't know about you, but I definitely do not enjoy that attitude. My husband was intrigued by the crab but the crab legs were so skinny, there was barely any meat in them.  Service wise, we barely got any attention from our assigned server. We got one refill for our drinks and looked around for him for more but he was nowhere to be found. Same goes for our empty plates, those were not picked up as quickly as other buffets have done in the past. A lot of the stations did not have tags on each dish either. One station in particular had something I would never have guessed was apple compote, in fact I stayed away at first but once I was able to ask what it was, it was pretty good!  Don't waste your money here looking for a great Vegas buffet experience, this is not it. The food was decent but the combination of the people manning each station, the lack of attention to detail on something as simple as a label and temperature/general lacking in the food really was disappointing. It could be great with a little work on simple things.",

It did take awhile to for us to be seated as the hostess was taking her time seating people. Once seated, our server only brought drinks over when we asked. My cup was empty and he still would not prompt himself to drop off a refill or ask if I wanted anything else despite walking past my table. He did stop by a few times to clear plates.   The food selection was small although it was nice to see chilled crab legs offered. The warm food selection was alright but I was too full to enjoy most of it. The salad bar did not look fresh. The cantaloupe and salad looked like it had been there all day. The signage did not match some of the items. The dessert section was disappointing. I am a fan of macarons and this is by far one of the worse I have tried. There was no flavour to the cookie and the texture was off. It was just sweet with too much chocolate filling. Not to mention it was also assembled incorrectly. The almond meal was chunky and lacked the smooth surface you find in a quality macaron. The creme caramel looked like it was missing the caramel sauce. The crepe station was good. I would recommend that item for dessert.   Overall, I would stop by for the romantic ambiance. The dinner selection was okay other than a very weak dessert station.",

    "text": "I did a weekday breakfast and weekday dinner at Le Village Buffet at the Paris during my 24 hours using the Buffet of Buffet pass.    At 9am on a Wednesday, this place was crackin'.  I waited in line about 40 minutes to be seated.    I loved the ambience of this buffet.  It is decorated to look like you've walked into a French marketplace.  Each of the buffet stations is named after a region in France.  There was a selection of breads, all different variations of eggs (scrambled with sausage, scrambled with mushroom, etc.), ham, sausage, bacon, french toast, pastries different variations of potatoes, as well as made to order omelettes and crepes.  I also noticed that they had a yogurt bar with granola, raisins and nuts to mix in.  Plain, undressed salad and fresh sliced fruit were also available.  As I had an appointment at the spa, I ate \"light.\" I got a custom omelette, hash browns and a dessert crepe that came with a bananas foster style filled crepe with nutella/just chocolate sauce drizzled on top with the freshest whipped cream ever!  Although there was a decent selection of breakfast foods, the cooks at Le Village never skimped on quality, which really impressed me.  This led to us deciding to eat a dinner meal here as well.  For dinner, there were not a ton of vegetarian friendly options.  There were tons of meats available (chicken, duck, beef, lamb, crab legs) and dishes containing meat.  Same great bread selection and the expected salad bar fixings.  The french onion soup seemed popular.  However, after experiencing a great dessert crepe at breakfast, I went straight for the savory caprese crepe at dinner and didn't regret it.  The balsamic reduction was delish!  I also tried the sweet potato, mashed potatoes and gratin potatoes.  All were tasty.    The dessert included many sugar free pastries as well as sugar-full desserts.  Eclairs, creme brulee, walnut brownies and fruit tarts all looked good, but I didn't go for them.  I settled with the chocolate custard and was pleased.    Overall, great quality and selection on breakfast and dinner.  Definitely worth it to do the buffet of buffets as weekday breakfast was priced at $18.99 and weekday dinner was priced at $30.99.  I paid $44.99 for the 24 hour Buffet of Buffet pass.",

The food was quite tasty, and I enjoyed everything I ate. I could easily give this place 5 stars except for the price ($35 on weekends). It's clearly to account for the more expensive items such as crab legs, which I don't really enjoy. If that's the reason you're going to a Vegas buffet, go to the Bellagio because they have more meaty and easier to eat crab legs.  The decore, which I assume is to be similar to a Paris street, but it's a bit cheesy.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll probably suggest to my wife that we go back to the Village. Oh, and skip their desserts in favor of a crepe.",

I had the eggs benedict(cold and just awful), eggs with lox and asparagus(again cold and AWFUL), the cheese bar(dried up and bland cheese NOT good quality), The things I had that were really good... the potatoes of two different kinds and the crepe station(I had the mushroom spinach my son the apple caramel) both the crepes were good.  I did not sample everything by the time I had tasted all the gross food and eaten my decent crepe I was full.  Was not worth the price I paid and would probably not go back.

With that said, the lines were even LONGER than usual, but it's Vegas, the lines for the buffets, except for breakfast are always long.  For some people, people don't like to get up for early morning buffets; probably still recovering from the previous night of partying/gambling/dabauchery :)    Vegas is Vegas; so parking - enough said; and Service - well, it's Vegas, just like with gambling, the house has the edge and it's hit and miss for us patrons :)  So now onto my FOOD reviews...  Very easy to access(being btwn the walkway to the Bally's and Paris casinos), this is one of my preferred AYCE locations.  The line for this buffet seems to be one of the longer ones; ranging from an hour to 2 1/2 hours long.  Has been rated one of the best buffets around, and the long lines seem to be reflective of that.   Anyway, probably one of the ones I liked better than the other buffets on the same range(btwn the $25-35 buffet range.  It's different when you go to the Bellagio and Wynn buffets...that's like comparing a regular old cherry to a reineer cherry.  Definitely not as many options as the Rio World Buffet, but it has a decent selection.  Skirt steaks and the desserts make this buffet very enjoyable.  I particularly liked the pasta options.  Again, try a little of everything - and you'll find what you like and what you don't like, but I'm sure you'll find something. =)",

Otherwise, the service was terrible and the food quality was bad. If it weren't for a $5 coupon, I would not have been happy.   Perhaps it was because I went during the \"off season\" (meaning... three DAYS after new year's), but the food tasted like it had been sitting there for hours. Other than the crab, there was nothing worth eating really. Everything tasted bland and had too much cream added. Their stations aren't labeled (other than dessert), so you just have to guess what you're eating as you move down the counters. The desserts were pretty bad... the freshly made crepe was okay, but I'd recommend not getting any fillings. The crepe on its own is okay.   I was so disappointed. I mean, isn't this supposed to be FRENCH food?! I know I can't expect Paris Vegas to be like Paris France, but STILL! It was pretty terrible food, and I lost my appetite half way through when I couldn't find anything particularly delicious. I'd just go to the Bellagio or Wynn next time.  All in all, I won't come back. Maybe I should try the breakfast, though?",

The rest of the food they had to offer was good but by no means great and definitely not worth the wait to get in.

Just great selections, Crab Legs, Shrimp, Prime Rib, Corn Beef Hash, to name a few.  FRESHLY made Crepes, the Creme Brulee made me want to do somersaults all through the restaurant.  So damn good!  I'm a big ice cream person and their Custard-style Ice Cream hit the spot, i even took a Cone to go!  I highly suggest Le Village Buffet.",

I enjoyed the nutella one more than the berry only because the berry one was way too sweet.   We made it in at the end of breakfast going into lunch so we got to eat both! eggs were bad............bacon was ok........i liked some of the pastas they had for lunch...the scallopped potatoes were ok...the desserts were not too shabby, some chic was trying to call this cheesecake square...\"flan\"...i wanted to say something but i held my breath and walked away shaking my head.  this buffet was ok. the line was long too. if youre in vegas there are always lines at every buffet...  My husband and I were not impressed with any of the buffets, reading reviews online and recommendations....did not help. maybe we have high expectations? Don't know, if we knew we would of just spent all that money on a high end place and gotten one meal...at least we would of known it was ONE excellent one.",

    "text": "We went there for the weekend brunch and it ended up being about $35/pp after waiting about 25 minutes to be seated. It also came with unlimited alcohol and we were not expecting much since buffet service always seemed to be lacking especially when refilling alcohol. However we were pleasantly surprised that the waitresses kept returning to us to refill drinks and clear up plates, even though we were in one of the smaller side rooms. She even left us a canter of mimosa.  The food on the other hand was just OK. The highly anticipated crepes was the biggest downside after waiting 20 minutes in line to order. The crepe was just too thick (it was more of a lighter pancake) and the filling tasted old due to being left out too long. The best dish was the clam which had a fradiavolo type sauce with it. They also had crab legs which were halved, so you don't have to crack it. The highlight of the meal was probably the creme brulee which I had to sadly force down ( I was disgustingly full, probably after drinking close to a pitcher of mimosa because I certainly don't remember eating much of the food).  Tip: Decent brunch buffet, don't wait on the crepe line. I would suggest to try the crepe place across, I heard better reviews from others while waiting at the crepe station.",

Used a groupon for dinner buffet last week that included a bottle of wine (they said they were out of wine & substituted a bottle of charmat bulk process champagne) OUT OF WINE? Really? Anyway the service was ok, the wait was not long as we went early on a weekday, and it's definitely worth going to especially if you get a discount. People who complain about the wait should get used to the fact that if they go to a strip buffet in the summer at prime time they are not the only one's going! Pluses are snow crab is pre split & fairly tasty & easy to eat, dessert selection is above average & I agree creme brulee really good, A decent selection of choices.  Minuses are salad bar selection a little thin (I wish they had some artichoke hearts) but anchovies to top your salad is a nice touch. They were out of the beef bougignon when I passed that station.",

Or u can just have plain eggs, sunny side up, scramble, etc. the carving station has ham and thick bacon   Fresh fruit and lots of sweets!!! The ice cream was a vanilla custard a chocolate custard... It was similar to frozen yogurt but it tastes so rich and creamy.    Overalll i highly recommend it too everyone to try!!!",

We got a glass as our creamer,  made to order omlettes are good, but potatoes taste freezer burnt. The serving utensils at the buffet are sticky (gross!). Smoked salmon is good.  Worst part... there are NO REAL Jams, jellies or preserves, only prepackaged cups of Smucker's which is all high fructose corn syrup. My impression is there was a major budget cut back and the quality has suffered greatly.",

    "text": "My BF and I went here for Breakfast on a Saturday morning around 9am, and the line wasn't too long, only a 5-10 minute or so wait once you get inside the doors (the line curves around and can extend to the outside part of the restaurant).  When we were leaving, however, the line was twice as long, so come earlier if you can't wait to eat!  It was definitely worth it, and next time, I would wait longer if needed!    If youre looking for a fancy place, this isn't it.  I thought of it more as a family-friendly, down to earth type of place.  The decor is nice, very european (it IS in the Paris hotel, haha).  It kinda reminded me of Busch Gardens Europe (in Va).  I really liked the selection of breakfast food here.  They had all the breakfast staples - my favorite breakfast item was the made-to-order omlets - I recommend this instead of getting the pre-made scrambled eggs to save room in your stomach!  Since we came relatively early, we didn't have to wait in a long line at the stations, either, which I read in other reviews, except the crepes/waffles station looked a little long so I didn't try it.  They had silver dollar pancakes that had been sitting a little while, so mine were hard as a rock- one of the only down sides to this buffet, which you may not find if you come here.  They had a nice selection of cheese, pate (if youre into it), salmon, oatmeal, cream of wheat, fresh breads, fresh fruit, churros, they had pretty much everything.  The dessert station wasn't very extravagant, I guess since it was breakfast, understandable.  I can't remember exactly but I think they had cookies, banana chips, scones, etc.  There was a lady inside the dessert station torching creme brulee which was probably for dinner since she didn't put any out.  We did end up having the chocolate and vanilla soft-serve custard, which oddly enough, was fabulous for an after-breakfast dessert :)    As far as the service goes, our waitress was a little slow, I think since it was so busy there as we were about to leave.  You pay up front before you get inside, juice is included in the price plus another drink of your choice.      I have yet to try this buffet for dinner, but I would definitely reccomend this buffet for breakfast and will definitely come back again!",

We realized we hadn't hit up a buffet yet so we better do it before we leave. We were staying in the bellagio but were too cheap to pay the price, plus we'd already left and were too lazy and hungry to walk back. So we had popped into Paris to see what they had. It was a semi long line, probably about a 15 min wait. Worth the wait? Not really. The food was ok, and of course it's a buffet so there's stuff you can find to grub on but really nothing that impressed me. Next time someone suggest the buffet here just pick whatever the other option is, this isn't too exciting.",

The lamb was dry, the crab legs were just gross, and the cheese and salad selection was pitiful.  The quality of the food in general was just not worthy of the price.  Before we discovered the Aladdin buffet, which doesn't exist anymore, we used to hit up the Paris buffet on every trip.  It was worth it back then with a much better selection and better quality food.  Now, you could easily get the same quality garbage at a buffet that is half the price.  I was very disappointed.",

The crab legs were old and there were only 20 or so out and they were not being replenished by the staff. By far the worst buffet in Vegas. Save yourself some time and go to the Creperie across the hall from the buffet. For $8.99 you  have a delicious huge crepe that will fill you better  than the buffet ever could. I would not return to Paris on my next trip to Vegas. I wasnt too impressed. It is no Venetian. I recommend the buffet at Mandalay Bay as it was the most impressive with the best choices, and the Wynn Buffet as a close second. And do not forget Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "Crepes!  Le Village Buffet at The Paris does indeed boast a rustic French village vibe, albeit filtered through a faux-Disneyland style, but the decor is charmingly kitschy enough. The spread is more than decent, good enough to make up for the long lines that form on weekends. Prices are a bit steep as well, but with their emphasis on French delicacies like pastries, cheeses, and made to order Crepes, which beats Omelets any day (though you can also order those at the Omelet station).  A fun yet slightly pricey buffet that's one of the most popular in Las Vegas for good reasons.",

Overall, it was an awesome buffet. The food was very fresh for a buffet and they had a wide array of foods. I was especially hapy with their selection of grilled meats, impressive. they had all of the goodies you'd want in a buffet with a French theme. I think the breakfast was a tad better than the dinner, but overall it was very good.",

There is a great selection of cheeses and main courses. There are even king crab legs and all you can eat peel shrimp!  If you don't want to wait in line, go at the end of the period (so if it closes at 11, go at 10). They keep bringing out food until the last 30 minutes or so, so you're not left eating cold stuff.  They don't take plates away fast enough, though. Me and two other people at a table for four were barely able to Tetris everything on to fit. Also, a waiter has to bring you drinks. This also means that you can order alcohol :D Bon Appetite !",

The buffet here represents different regions of France (Lombardy, Provence, etc.) with their representative foods. Go for the nicely cooked prime rib and go often.  This buffet is cheaper ($25 in 2003 at least) and better than the Bellagio's.",

The wait was easily 30min so when we were given the hefty total before being seated we had some hope that our pallets would be much happier than our wallets. Alas...we were left wanting. La Village Buffet had a pretty ample selection of items from the standard crab legs and prime rib...to some \"regional\" offerings such as lamb and cheese plates. But even the items I wouldn't say were \"bad\" were lacking. Items that should have carried the buffet just dropped dead. The crab legs tasted and felt like they had been there all day (the meat did not come out in chucks, yet fell apart)...and the prime rib was almost painful to eat...tasting as though someone needed to leave for break while it was cooking so they just put it out a bit early. Save you money peoples. For less mulla you can head over to Mirage and have food that is ten times as good...or spend a little more of that black jack loot and head over to the Belagio.",

My aunt grabbed what she thought were sliced melons but were actually huge blocks of cheese (hahah... that was pretty funny... )  It's a waste of space to have a fruit/salad bar with little to no variety.    Nothing was memorable.  I strongly suggest eating elsewhere.  My family and I experienced tummy aches and pains after dining.    PLUS, there were plenty of seats inside yet they insisted on making everyone wait in a ridiculous, winding line in hopes to make their restaurant look more appealing to passerbyers.

They had a great selection of food: seafood, meat, desserts, etc. But let me say that the crepes here are thee most delicious crepes I've ever had. The nutella one with the bananas and the hazelnuts is a must for dessert. Also, the prime rib was cooked very well and very tender. And you must have the truffle mac and cheese. I wish I found the truffle mac and cheese first because after the crepes, the prime rib and like 8 mimosas I was stuffed. About the mimosas, you can taste the champagne, but it was definitely more OJ than champagne. If you can get just champagne as your bottomless, do it.

So we went to this buffet for dinner and breakfast.  Dinner: There are many stations full of tons of full. The best things that I ate were the Prime Rib, cooke perfect and tender. The Beef rib was moist and tender. The brie, bacon, macaroni and cheese was one of the most delicious pasta dishes i have ever eaten. Roasted veggies would have been better if they had just been roasted. Truffle Mashed potatoes deliciously fluffy but couldn't taste the truffle. Dessert crepes were very good.  Breakfast: Still full from the night before, we went to breakfast earlier than we wanted to because the line for breakfast is outrageous if you don't get there before 9am.   Breakfast in some ways seemed like leftover dinner. The turkey sausage stuffed with sweet potato was the left over turkey breast grounded and then stuffed with the left over roasted sweet potato, not impressive tasting, but i like the resourcefulness of not wasting some of their food. Breakfast crepe apple was very good and huge row of fresh fruit that was ripe and delicious. The smoked salmon for bagels and lox was very good.   I would go back.",

But u do pay extra for the fancy Baccahanal buffet and the Seafood buffet in Rio casino. If u r a big eater and is up to the food challenge. This is the best gamble u get when visiting LV. Some of this buffet lines r long. So have a strategic plan of which to visit first so u won't waste your time waiting! Cause in reality, you only have around 13 Hrs to eat.

Everyone was quiet and tired looking. The only excitement we got in line was when a Brave lady decided to charge her phone at a outlet and she just left it there. We played the \"who's goin to steal that iPhone game\". She returned 20 minutes later and grabbed her phone. Seriously that  Was the highlight of the wait.  Decoration: very classy and French like. Everything starts with \"Le\" something something something... Too hard to pronounce. Lots of old fashion stuff, antiques, paintings, and even the workers. For all the youngsters, if you want a hyped up buffet, just go to wicked spoon or Wynn because this is more like a family buffet.  Service: out waitress was very nice. She gave us so many drink options but never the champaign menu. She made us feel so young because we are legal to drink but she thought we were all 15 or 16. Why thank you :)  Food: sucks overall  [pros]:  1. Delicious fruits: fresh and sweet 2.yummy scrambled eggs with sausages was not too salty and was fluffed just right  3.chocolate and vanilla custard ice cream was so refreshing 4.creme brulee was good and very light 5. nice cold water 6. French onion soups was salty but not ad bad as Outbacks. Not cheese though  [cons]: 1.  only three fruits were offered which were  Pineapples, honeydew, and cantaloupe 2. Stations were not organized... I didn't know where to start because all the stations have random foods. For instance, the salad bar and fruits were in the middle of the room. Cool. Where's the sushi? Oh it's with the breakfast station. Err okay? Let's go to the breakfast station. Whaat?? They're everywhere! Station 1: egg Benedict with roast beef and prime ribs, station 2: stir fried veggies, mashed potatoes, bread, station 3: scrambled eggs, waffles, sushi, sausages, station 4: fried chicken, crab legs, soup. And there's a section full of desserts. 3. Egg Benedict: I only ate the egg cuz the muffin was hard as rock and the ham was hard and dry 4. Sausage smells gross 5. Sushi rice is super hard  6. Smoked salmon is super salty 7. Cookies was rock hard... I can kill someone with then 8. For a French restaurant, where the hell is my macarons?! 9. Restroom: only one stall.  10. Pretty everything was dry and gross  I'll return once in a while.. But not anytime soon",

    "text": "I'm really picky about my buffets. They have to have good QUALITY food over QUANTITY food. I don't care for places like the Rio where there is an abundance of food but the quality SUCKS! Another important factor is price. I don't feel like spending nearly $50 on a buffet. There's no way I can eat $50 worth of food in my opinion.  Which leads me to the Paris buffet. I came here during the lunch hour which on a weekend is called brunch. Spent about $27 which is adequate price for a Vegas buffet. Although some places are much more higher and some are even cheaper.  The ambiance is fantastic. You almost feel like your in Europe sitting in a little cafe with other tourist. You feel like your not in Vegas at all. It's quite cute actually.  The quality of the food is fantastic!! It's cooked very well I didn't eat anything I didn't like. I tried as much as I could. I was very fond of the 2 different types of chicken they had. Baked and roasted. They were both so tender and juicy. So full of flavor! Their pesto pasta was quite awesome too. They also have a decent tasty quiche!!  The best part of the buffet had to be the desserts though. They have such an array of desserts and everything tasted so delicious! They had cheesecake, flan, chocolate/vanilla ice cream, cookies, baked goods, fruit, and my personal favorite, CREME BRULEE!!  The creme brulee tasted awesome. My boyfriend loved the flan. I was actually quite impressed with the vanilla soft serve ice cream. It was very yummy and had a french vanilla flavor to it.  Service is great and the food is great. You should really check this place out. Save a few bucks and come here instead of the Wynn or Bellagio. You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "The wait was NOT worth the wait.  Honestly, I don't know what was the hold up with the line.  As I was waiting with my group, I looked up on Yelp and when I saw people saying they were waiting in line for over an hour, I judged the length of my line and thought maybe 20 minutes tops.  Boy, was I wrong.  They were seating a party about every 3 minutes.  I'll give them the benefit and say that it was probably due to their limited seating, and hope that it is not simply the staff's inefficiency.   The offerings at the buffet itself were not very 'French' as per the assumed theme this buffet was projecting.  Most of the spoon handles had been in use for too long (and looked like they were given to a teething infant for a few hours and felt just as sticky as you can imagine).   The food that those instruments dished up was bland, and not very appealing.  I will say our server kept on top of our drinks (non-alcoholic), but missed the plates.  The whole staff just seemed over-loaded by the crowds and like they had never experienced such an amount of patrons in their restaurant at a time.  Really confused as to what this was all about since our server mentioned to us that this happens all the time.  Well, then prepare for it a little more!  As stated previously, totally not worth your wait in line.  While you're waiting there, look over the reviews of the Bellagio buffet, and if you can cough up a few dollars more, ditch this line and head across the street.  You'll be glad you did, trust me.",

I always look forward to eating there. We were supposedly seated at a preferred Platinum Club table. Our table was around the corner from the Provence section: right where all the buffet staff comes in and out of the kitchen with huge carts on wheels, clattering along the cobblestone floors, making horrendous noises throughout the meal. There was nothing relaxing about this meal! The food did not feel up to par to us. I always loved the individual servings of beef bourguignon and things like that, but there were none of those. One prime rib looked positively raw. The sushi was boring (only two kinds). There were no chicken dishes that I saw. The salads were bland. I've always been intrigued by the crepe station, but the line is always so long and slow that I have never taken the time to get one. I have bragged up this buffet to so many people--it was really a bit embarrassing. I still love the creme brulee and macaroon cookies for dessert, but I'm not sure they're worth going there just for that. The cashier and server were very nice. Le Village Buffet has gone from \"great\" to  \"pretty average\" in a very short period of time. Very disappointing!",

Good crepes station - fill with many different kinds of fruit.  Love all the different cheeses and the sausage here was very good.

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I love french food. It is one of my favs. Now to the review, don't waste your money or appetite at this buffet. At best it is mediocre, but realistically it just plain sucks. I have eaten here twice, the first time by choice, the second time I was talked into it. I tried to sample a bit of everything that looked appealing. I tried probably 25-30 very small portions of what they had to offer. This is how I like to work the buffets, and if there is anything I really like I go get more. Nothing was even so-so. Nothing tasted horrid, it was all just bland, boring and immediately forgettable. Also, some of the items resembled french food and even used their names like coq au vin, etc. But in reality, the food resembled French food about as much as the Hotel really resembles Paris. Feels more like Disneyland than France by a long shot.   My advice, go to the Bellagio, Wynn or even The Buffet at the M. They are all far superior and you will have a much happier ending to your meal. Au revoir!  After writing the previous review, I was talked into going back by my wife for breakfast. it was pretty good, nothing terrilby exciting but i was content and full afterwards. Good eggs, meats, smoked salmon (YUM), etc. My wife ordered a crepe and it was way to sweet for my pallette. I do have to admit, aesthetically, Le Village is one of the most pleasing buffets to eat in if nothing else. It feels nothing like a real French place though.",

Although I may have come close to eating my own body weight in crab legs and shrimp cocktail*, as well as guzzled nearly a bottle of champagne all by myself**, I question whether or not I managed to make up for the $25 + $15 \"express pass\" cost of entry to the buffet.  Apparently this joint competes on the basis of unlimited bubbly, not on the quality of its food.  To be expected for a has-been casino/hotel like Paris, I suppose.  If one is willing to wait through the excessive lines for regular admittance at the standard $25 price point, it's probably a solid value.  My party was not, but... hey... time is money, no?  Here's me not laying claim to my frugal Asian roots.  Recommended for those with superhuman patience, or for alcoholics with a wad a cash burning a hole through their pockets.

I'm a huge fan of potatoes with your breakfast.  They have hash browns, scalloped, fried, and something else, I forgot.  But, the last time I went, I did count 4.

In '07, I waited for 3 hours, this year, I waited only for an hour. Aside from that, I have nothing but good things to say about this buffet.  I have tried all of the other buffets in Las Vegas, and I keep coming back to this one. The main reason is the dessert. Nothing beats their dessert. Their creme brulee is my favorite to grab, as well as their tiramisu. As for the other entrees, they always have a good selection, especially during Thanksgiving. Their meats are always cooked well, and their seafood selections are amazing. I have yet to eat anything that was dry or unappetizing.  The servers are always so helpful, and quick to take your plates. Maybe I get lucky with who the servers are in my area, but they have always given me 100% quality customer service.  The price ranges for the different meals. During Thanksgiving, they are usually $25+.  When you do decide to go to Le Village, make sure you fast for a few hours.

Not so much now. As we walked around looking for our favorite cheeses, we discovered that they had really cheapened up the cheese tray.  There was no brie, no soft bleu or otherfwise, just some slices of what appeared to be cheddar or havarti.  Many of the areas were empty and they were not quick to refill. I was excited to finally get a crab leg, but when I cracked it, the smell was so fishy that I chose not to eat it.    The Prime Rib was very good and there was a good assortment of vegetables and fruit.  My husband had a made to order omelette, however, they didn't have any sour cream. The breads were good, not nearly the beautiful dessert buffet with French pastries that they had had in the past.  The service of the front line staff (hostess, wait staff) was good,     Oveall, I was disappointed as I really felt that the quality had gone down hill. I remember when this was the best buffet in all of Vegas, not so much any more.",

The cost was ~$25 for the all-you-can-eat buffet. The place was crowded, but the employees were nice.  The decor was nice and the food was average. I remember going back for shrimp and of course, trying most of the desserts. Would I go back? No...but that's because I'm not a fan of buffets since the food is always mediocre and I never eat my money's worth.",

For the non-meat eaters, the veggie options are really good.  You might not get your 25 dollars worth on veggies, but the grilled veggies, mushrooms, cheeses, and cooked carrots are delicious.    Le Village Buffet also has a crepe station where a very nice man makes you your very own sweet or savory crepe to order.  There is also a wide variety of dessert items and the mini creme brules are a must have.  Go ahead... have five!  The meat items are o.k. and the seafood is what you would expect to get in the desert... a little too fishy for me.  The staff was very friendly and helpful too!",

Overall, I'm confused by all the good reviews, a lot of sites even call Le Village Buffet, Vegas's best buffet! Yikes!  Even at $14.99 per person, not nearly worth it.  Although I don't eat meat, I can tell you if I did I would definitely not be partaking in it here! Wow, did it look bad.   Basically, on par with cafeteria food. After eating here, my husband and I both successfully lost our appetites for the rest of the day. So perhaps a good stop for the beginning of a diet?",

    "text": "Le Village proves that you don't have to have the biggest and most extravagant spread (that would be Bacchanal at Caesar's) to provide a thoroughly enjoyable experience.   As of October 2013, Le Village is the only buffet in Vegas that offers reservations through Open Table.  When you have a reservation, you by pass the line and go through a separate entrance parlor that is also used by Total Rewards Platinum and Diamond members.   Waiting in line for 30 minutes to an hour for a buffet really stinks but with our reservation, we didn't wait at all!  And we were 15 minutes late for our reserved time.  One member of our party had Platinum status so it allowed us to use the special check in desk even if we hadn't had a reservation.  It also enabled us to be seated in a special area where we received special service.  What \"special service\" might you ask?  Our server was extra friendly but the great thing is that she offered to bring us steamed crab legs to our table!  At Le Village, the \"common people\" schlep up to the buffet line to help themselves and pick through the crab legs which are served cold.  Unlike at Bacchanal, where you can request the crab legs to be boiled and served hot, Le Village doesn't offer warm steamed crab legs except for the \"status\" diners.  And she brought hot bowl after bowl of hot juicy crab legs until we begged her to stop!  Being brought crab legs directly to your table elevates a buffet dining experience beyond the normal and makes dining so much more enjoyable.  After having gorged on so many crab legs, we only had enough room leftover to sample a few other dishes.  The only reason that I don't give Le Village 5 stars is because the selection of dishes doesn't rival that of Bacchanal.  But I actually did enjoy the crab legs better at Le Village because they were brought to our table and also they are not salty, unlike at Bacchanal.  Aside from the food, we also loved the slightly kitschy atmosphere of the French village.  The macarons and other desserts were very good (albeit not a huge variety like Bacchanal) and instead of standard soft serve, they offer frozen custard, which has a slightly different texture and richer taste.  At the end of our meal, our server brought to our table of 5 people 10 chocolate bar lollipops shaped like the Eiffel Tower, 5 dark chocolate and 5 white chocolate.  We later saw these identical treats in a gift shop in the hotel for $3.50 each!   I'd highly recommend getting Platinum status so that you can enjoy the benefits!  If you don't want to gamble a lot to earn your status, you can instantly get Platinum status if you apply for and get approved for the Total Rewards credit card.",

Except after the 2nd buffet, you really want to run straight towards a toilet or grab a roll of Tums.  Seriously, no one should be eating more than one buffet within 24 hours.  Heck with it all though, this is Vegas...the city of losing wages and eating just as much as you freakin can!  This was our 3rd buffet on our pass...a dinner stop.   Highlights:   CREPES!!!  Yummy delicious crepes...I take em plain with some powdered sugar. Really nice lady making em...the crepes were perfectly chewy...I had 2.  Ugh.   Seafood.  A combination of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams.  Not the greatest...but good enough.  Dessert.  Probably the biggest display out of all the buffets we went to.  They're your usual buffet fare...nothing was really wow but enough to satisfy your dessert craving.   The duck was also pretty good...it was made with orange sauce and rice pilaf.  Can't think of any of the other standouts as the buffets mostly had the same things.    Pretty decent buffet...#3 on our buffet list.",

If you make a reservation through them you go through the VIP section instead of standing in line (and the line was long!)  Overall, the buffet was pretty good, especially for the groupon price. Everything seemed a bit salty, but because none of us had eaten yet we all inhaled everything. The only thing that really stood out to me was the deserts. Both the creme brulee and the flan were amazing! None of us waited for the crepes, but they also looked really good.

    "text": "So glad we spotted this place while touring through the Paris Las Vegas. We were planning on swinging out to the Four Kegs (see my previous review) for Stromboli, but took a peek in this place. The ambiance and setting were just too much for the wife and our friend to not check out the fare. After poking around the stations we opted to pay the $23 ($20 w/ a player's card) for lunch.  The food was fantastic and they had quite an assortment to choose from. Some of our highlights / favorites were:  Braised Pork Belly Andouie Sausage Chateaubriand style tri-tip brie & bacon Macaroni and Cheese Capatavi w/ truffle oil and mushrooms  The prime rib was also to die for: medium-rare and super tender / moist!  Many veggies to choose from, including perfectly roasted asparagus!  They offered an assortment of seafood; including stuffed sole, mussels, clams and shrimp.  They had a savory and sweet crepe station, for those who enjoy crepes (we did not partake, however).  As for dessert they had some of the usual fare one would find at a buffet, but here they had three items that are hard to come by (and in which we indulged): creme brulee, French style (lemon infused) macaroons (light & fluffy), and custard (not soft serve ice cream).  To make a long short, we definitely got our monies worth! We are already planning to eat here again, on our next LV trip, with our son and his fiancee! The dinner menu looks awesome (includes duck!). The wife and I concurred that we would give this restaurant (buffet) five (5) stars!   They MUST have REAL chefs working here, not the \"usual\" hired off the street types who simply follow the establishment's recipes (which usually = WTF).

However, I must say that both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised.   The wait was nearly nonexistent (it was early Thursday after all), and we were seated within five minutes despite having no reservation. Our server was friendly, but was clearly having to man a lot of duties, as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit.   But of course any buffet lives and dies on the food, and the fare here ranges from average to surprisingly good. The highlights were the fantastic crepe station (\"Le Singe\", a banana and hazelnut crepe, was excellent), the flan, which was some of the best I've had buffet or otherwise, and the seafood offerings like bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels. The other entries were all passable to good, and I cleared all three plates.   The price might be a touch high, especially with the Bellagio across the street for a few dollars more, but I actually preferred this buffet to the Wynn which we are in the same week. It's a quaint French countryside take on the Vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence.",

As someone who follows a Vegan diet, I was looking forward to the salad bar which was an embarrassment. The salad bar was clearly not kept up with or replenished at all, even when the food was low. I was grossed out just by thinking of how many hours those salads have been sitting out there. It was completely abandoned (the dim lighting didn't help). The baked desserts reportedly had the same problem as the salad bar (stale).   Although, others in my party seemed to enjoy the seafood options & crepe bar! I can say the food they kept hot was good such as their roasted vegetables and pastas.  The service was extremely slow, the hardest part of the meal was hunting someone down for new utensils or a cup of water.  Lunch for $24.99 was alright, not worth it if you're vegan IMO. I rather shell out a few extra dollars & head over to the Bacchanal buffet across the street (fresh juice!).",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to some awesome French food at this buffet... but besides the crepes and creme brulee, I really didn't find any. It was really disappointing and my dad kept complaining about the lack of variety of food options too.  There was a huge line but we opted to pay $10 more for the 'express' line which was not worth it. We definitely would've crossed the street for some Bellagio buffet goodness instead and give them the extra $10 bucks.  The service was crappy too, I felt bad for the servers who were mostly older ladies. I saw one of them limping while she walked and it was worse because she had to carry heavy-ass plates and cups back and forth. She even came by to tell us that she was exhausted from working since 6 am that morning (it was 3 pm at the time). And because of that, I shall forgive her for pouring my requested apple juice into the cup that used to hold my dad's orange juice. No wonder it tasted funky.  My favorite part was definitely the creme brulee and crepes as others have mentioned. My dad really liked the cocktail shrimp, he said he's never seen such a clean shrimp before.  The place was cute and everything but the buffets at the Wynn and Bellagio are definitely more worth your money.",

But if you're not so crazy about it being folded not in half, but around the filling, tell the chef beforehand how you want it done. I wanted just sugar, lemon and butter. Made! TIP - Macarons and creme brulee are freshly made! Must have.  TIP - if it's not crowded, you can ask the hostess if you can have your preference of seat - next to a wall or out in the open.  What I don't like - Food can be a bit too greasy/oily for my taste. Also, it's hard to flag down your waitress. So order twice your drinks when you get seated!",

    "text": "Hmmm...I'd really like to give this place a 2 1/2 primarily because of my disappointment, but I think in all fairness the food is just fine.  5 years ago, I loved this place. 2 years ago I liked this place. This month....ehhhhh it was ok.  There used to be dishes like beef bourguignon, and coq au vin which made this a unique experience. Lots and lots and lots of different grilled veggies too and great salads. This time around, significantly less veggies (yes I know a lot of people don't go to buffets for veggies), and neither of my favorite dishes. This time around the food seemed like the stuff you find at any other buffet...nothing unique, and the quality was just ok.  The duck was dry.   People really seem to love the abundance of crab legs, and that may be my problem...I don't really eat crab. But the abundance is definitely there for those that are interested.  There are still long lines, and still less than personable service (but nothing overtly rude...just ok).  The desserts have expanded a bit over the years, but they were just ok.  Wicked Spoon across the street had better (according to the partner who loves desserts, but also cares about the taste more than the presentation).     The price is a bit lower than say the Bellagio, so all in all probably not a bad deal. I'd go early though at the dinner hour, to avoid the ridiculously long line...you'll just have the semi-ridiculously long line.   After being a fan of this buffet for many years though, will be branching out next time to try something new.",

The whole Paris hotel and casino has this really fun outdoor theme going on so sitting in their dining room is like sitting in a Paris courtyard...kind of ;)",

If you want to try multiple buffets, head to the Bellagio buffet last. We waited for the brunch buffet at 11:30am and proceeded to make no progress for the most part after 45 minutes. Diamond card members get the express treatment and causes the regular line to move twice as slow. The only saving grace for this buffet were the crepes, but even that's to say it's only better than the other food available.   Bottom line, if you're in to 29.99 average crepes, this place is for you. Oh yeah, there's only one stall in the womens room (use the restrooms before or after the buffet in the main casino).",

I would pass.  As for Paris, we ate there twice, wished we had gone for dinner over MBay.  Nice combination of everything, homemade crepes were nice, wide variety of carnivore foods, carbs, carbs carbs, little cups of creme brulee quite yum.

The food was pretty good and the options were plentiful. I really enjoyed the soups, hot spinach and artichoke dip, cheese platter and desserts. The mini creme brulee was very good. Pass on the bread pudding (some of the worst I've ever tried and I have eaten a lot). I finished with a nutella and banana (fresh from the dessert area) crepe. This is what I was looking forward to the most. It was good but would have been great if the woman making them would take her time more. It was kind of a shoddy preparation. The crepes at the Jean Philippe patisserie in the Bellagio or Aria are worlds better since they are prepared with more care.   Service here was not great. It was difficult to get drinks. The scenery is very nice, one of the nicer buffets visually.   I would eat here again but would choose my food more wisely. I tried too many things and was a little overstuffed at the end.",

Though the fare doesn't really stray into different ethnic cuisines, what's there is fantastic. I can't speak as to the authenticity of the regional variations of French cuisine that Le Village boasts, but it is certainly enough to have quite a selection.  Breakfast: Crepes. The crepes were amazing. So light, fluffy and STUFFED with your choice of fruits and fillings. Make sure to try the prime rib hash and their eggs benedict!   Dinner: The prime rib was my favorite in all of Vegas. It was juicy, flavorful, tender, medium rare and just...mmm..... Various other accouterments of potatoes etc. were also fantastic. I did not get a chance to sample the crab. Most everything else in terms of entrees was also very good.  The desserts were sooooooooooooooo good. My girlfriend and I actually ended up coming back for creme brulee and frozen custard way after dinner, just because we could with the Buffet of Buffets pass.   Service was decent. Felt a little lonely sometimes waiting for refills in small groups, but when I went in large groups with my young niece and nephew, the waitresses were kind and attentive. A floor manager, whose name I was not able to get, was also very kind and brought us some small boxes of Fruit Loops for the kids when they weren't really enjoying the other breakfast foods.",

First we walked around, and while the decor is cute, some of the dishes were empty, or looked picked through. For $32/pers I don't expect caviar and foie gras but I do expect appealing dishes. The pate 'station' is a joke (one pate, sliced and 'tossed' in a big serving bowl).  The cheese bowl next to it has pepper jack, Cheddar and smoked gouda.  Why are slices of cheese presented in a bowl and not on a board?  Looks messy. Maybe a little effort and 3 classic french cheeses could be offered, like brie, comte and roquefort?  The worst part was the shrimp cocktail. While there was an attempt to devein them (they were sliced on the back), it was only and attempt. On my plate, 4 shrimp (out of 8) with 'poop' in them, the unmistakable black line.  Pointed that out to the hostess who didn't see to care.  A few good things: the baguette was good, seemed fresh made.  The potato gratin also good, as well as truffle mac and cheese. The dessert station looked nice, tried creme brulee and lemon tart, both tasty.  I didn't taste the macarons, they looked good even though they're assembled wrong.  The crepe station is popular and the sweet crepes looked enormous and decadent.  Overall, I would say a mediocre experience and I would not return.",

The mashed potatoes, mixed veggies, prime rib and everything else that I could not remember was really good. The buffet area is really large, but the only down side is that you have to leave the buffet area to use the restroom. It was all good. I know there are a bunch of other places to get a good buffet in Vegas, and we will probably try a different one depending on where we stay next time. We gave it a try and we were not disappointed.

I used to think that the buffet at The Rio was the best, and it would still be but in my humble opinion, it has been eclipsed by Le Village at Paris LV. The food stations are arraigned by the provinces of France. They have the Burgundy station with foods representative of what is prepared in Burgundy. There is also a Provence station, a Normandy station and a Alsace-Lorraine station. Being my mother's mother's family is from Alsace-Lorraine, I am immensely interested in what they have to serve. True it's a bit pricy, but if you wanted to take a gastronomic tour of France, it would cost you a hell of a lot more than the 28 bucks, or whatever they charge these days.",

The selection is huge and there is really too much to choose from.  Overall the food tastes pretty good and the dessert selection is particularly nice.    Unfortunately, the lines here are usually pretty long, so I'd suggest getting there prior to each meal (e.g. 11:30 for lunch, 5:30 for dinner) to help with that problem.  The other advantage to that is by going early, you get to pay the prior meal price, which is less (that is, by going before lunch, you get to pay the breakfast price, etc.).  Check on the meal hours before taking advantage of this suggestion.",

We were seated promptly in a small little room to ourselves with three windows and our own personal server.   At least it appeared that way. So what to expect from the buffet? Zeeeee crab legs in Zeeeee butter. Le Prime rib...c'est tres bien. I suggest the natural juices they provide for your prime rib and mashed potatoes. Tri tip steak snuck out when I was almost done, yet I saved enough room for it. Slightly red in the middle, had excellent flavor and wish I had made more room for this. A great finish to our meal was the well prepared creme brulee and / or the tart with a small variety of berries on it. Superb service by our waiter and a fresh cup of coffee made for quite an evening of relaxation.  Would I return? Oui oui monsieur",

    "text": "I stayed at the Paris and I came here for breakfast buffet. I was excited to see the crepe station. They had savoury and sweet crepes to choose from. My first pick was the grilled chicken and spinach crepe. But the person making the crepes said they are out of chicken. I went there for breakfast, and the buffet just opened. How can they be out so fast? Or were they out since the evening of the previous night and they didn't replenish the chicken? Anyways I was quite disappointed how unprepared they were. I had to choose something else which was the caprese one.   The other food items were mediocre. A lot of the food were cold. The desserts were bad. They have macarons but they are poorly put together and they have barely any taste. I don't expect much from a buffet. I guess Paris Le Village has decent food for a buffet. Would I come back? Probably not. I only wanted to have one buffet visit during my Vegas stay and I chose this one since I was at this hotel. I guess buffet isn't really my thing since I can't get my money's worth as I can't eat that much, and I would rather put my money towards better quality food.   If you do the 24hr buffet pass, I think this buffet has decent food for a buffet and it's worth dropping by to sample some items. But I wouldn't suggest paying a one-time buffet price since you can get much better food at the same price.",

But coming here was definitely worth the continuous explosive watery number twos and stomachache afterwards. Spend your money on the 24-hour buffet run and avoid this one.

It's pretty much the same as all Caesar's other buffets in town, which are all around the same price point (except the Bacchanal). Not bad and an OK variety but nothing particularly interesting. I hoped at least the pastry/dessert station would put in an extra effort but it was actually the weakest point, with kinda low-quality versions of what would normally be better-end desserts.  One good thing was the coffee - not awesome but better than the usual Folgers / Maxwell House buffet coffee and they bring you a huge carafe of it. A fairly strong dark French roast in keeping with the general theme.",

I do highly recommend making reservations, and note that there's a separate line/entrance for those that do. If you don't, well the wait can be awhile.   I've seen some complaints in the reviews but I think people forget that most of their issues are first world problems. This is a buffet, let's not forget. It's not a 5 star gourmet restaurant.

Things have changed though and I doubt we'll ever be back. The crepe station was a favorite of ours. On this last visit which was early dinner around 4:45, we found some of our favorite crepes were no longer being made. the only savory choice was ham and cheese. Really? I don't eat pork - neither does half the world. I got some potato pancakes from a station that included breakfast items. When I tried eating the pancakes, I found I couldn't cut them. I picked one up and snapped it in half. I have to wonder how long a potato pancake has to sit in a buffet before it solidifies like that. Other issues, included a slice of prime rib I tried that also must have sat on the station too long, because it was tough and nearly inedible. The new drink station didn't include tomato juice and the coffee seemed old and stale. Also, the wait staff seemed stretched thin. I wondered if they cut back on staff since they no longer have to serve drinks. To top things off, I had indigestion and felt nauseated by the end of the meal, which lasted several hours after. I used to tell people to visit Le Village when they are in town. Now I tell them to stay away.",

I'm pretty sure that it was $21.99 per person for the breakfast buffet, which came out to $51 something.   I'm not going to lie; sometimes, I felt lost maneuvering through the buffet because the decor was a little overwhelming, and made it a little hard to find the food. that sounds a little dumb, but there was at least once where I didn't venture over to an area because I didn't know it was another station full of food. what i'm trying to tell you is that you need to walk around. some tucked away areas looked like they were just for dining, but there was even more food! what?!?!?   again, we were there for the breakfast buffet. I've never seen so many plates of eggs and potatoes, and potatoes and eggs! there was plenty of bacon and sausage, as well. They had brioche, waffles, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy. This review is getting hard to write because I really can't remember all the food that they had out! haha. Faves? Lyonese potatoes, and a pasta dish with truffle oil and asparagus.   Their dessert section had a LOT of croissants and other pastries, carrot cakes, cheesecakes, and creme brulee. Faves? tiny chocolate cake, and creme brulee.  They had a made-to-order crepe station and omelette station. The hubby loved the two crepes that he loaded up on: caprese and mixed berry. I, on the other hand, tried an omelette with mushroom, ham, and eggs, which was yum. What i probably loved most about the buffet was that the two people who were operating these two stations were sooooo pleasant. They didn't seem to hate their jobs even though they were the only ones there to help their line of 10 to 15 people. I'm a sucker for great customer service.   Ok. On the contrary, our first server had a serious attitude. So much so that she was actually arguing with the table next to us. I'm not going into that too much because she was replaced by another server, who was able to smile and not throw straws or napkins at our table.   All in all, this buffet was probably the best we've been to in Vegas. The ones we've visited within the past two years have been such a disappointment and waste of money. Next time, we'll have to come back for dinner! Hopefully, the line isn't long, though. We got lucky coming here at around 9 AM-ish; line was practically nonexistent.",

I know it sounds terrible, but surprisingly I had a great time.   It was my first time at the Paris buffet; but I've been to the wicked spoon, Wynn buffet and the one at Caesar's so I thought this place wasn't going to compare. The wait was short for a Vegas buffet, I think we only had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated. Now onto the review itself!  3 stars for the food, they have a decent selection of sea food and French cuisines. My favorite is the bouillabaisse?? (spell check please haha) Our server was really nice and was on top of everything. The dessert section was pretty lacking, and it only has two flavors of ice cream.  +1 star for the all you can drink, honestly after the 5th mimosa everything tasted the same. Of course being Asian, we have to get every drop of liquor out of my money. So we went for about 5 more.   I had a lot of fun with my friends here, if you get a chance to buy the Groupon definantly take advantage. It's great value! Other than that it's a typical Vegas buffet.",

The French onion soup appeared as if it had been sitting for hours - very little broth and crusted container - no bread or cheese to top it; the crab legs were frozen; the duck was obviously overcooked - very dry and chewy.  The crepe station was a nice touch - I chose the savory.  The truffle mushroom was tasty however the spinach, chicken artichoke crepe was bleah - and the filling was cold.  The bread was dried out and hard.  The prime rib was the star - perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  Maybe it was an off night - maybe not.",

I think people here like it because it's a buffet and they offer variety however don't expect amazing taste. The buffet is not bad at all but I thin i expected too much because of yelp.

Everyone in attendance always had a filled drink (almost too generously) and received whatever they asked for.  As far as the food is concerned, I was underwhelmed.  There wasn't anything that really stood out... maybe the dessert crepe and the beef bourginoun.  Everything else was just mediocre to fair.  Based on this experience, I'm not sure I will be back.

We ended up eating her twice.  The line was kind of annoying, and I swear that the buffets all like to take their time seating people to make sure there is always a queue. The servers were hit or miss, but Le Village is overall pretty good. The crepe stand is definitely worth your attention.  If you know what to expect from Vegas Buffets you'll like this place. I made the mistake of assuming that these places would have mind-blowingly good food, but that's just not the case. Really, it's just a lot of \"OK\" food.",

    "text": "Having come here two or three times in the past, I believe that this buffet changed. I don't actually remember that far back ro determine whether or not it's a good change or bad... I think  I'll make my final decision at the end of this review.  I guess I'll start off with what I liked- MACARONS. Similiar to many teenagers/pre-teen/adolesents (whatever the hell I am), I like to go with whatever is \"in\" right now. At the moment, I believe that these pricey little pastries ranging from $1.50 to $3.50 are the hype of hype. I guess it's because of how expensive it is. Anyways, there were macarons here. I think I ate 4 or 5. I understand that there are now macarons in almost every Vegas buffet, but I do believe it wasn't here before. The last time I went, there were very few pastries that I think I enjoyed. (Actually, I don't think I was a French-obbessed person then, so it might have been there and I haven't noticed.)  Well, in that case, I think I just wasted a whole paragraph. Because as I'm strolling through the buffet (Yes, I'm too full to be sitting down so I'm walking instead), I can't name one extraordinary thing about this place. Everything was rather medicore- nothing I wouldn't find at my hometown.   Most of their meat dishes were too salty. Their baguettes were sort of stale. (Okay, I'm Vietnamese so I'm used to crunchy French bread). The majority of the dishes were the same with just the sauce altered. Their macarons were actually tasting a bit stale-chewy (I don't know if any of you know what I'm talking about) after the 3rd one or so. Their crepes aren't all that good. I had \"La poulet\" (Um... isn't the word for chicken masculine?) . The chicken honestly looked like smashed little rocks or something. It wasn't really favorful or anything. I guess I should've tried a sweet crepe. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the desserts section composes of around 4-5 dishes. There are many different plates, but each plate contains the same thing. When I was there, it was some mushy cheesecake and chocolate mousse. There WERE chocolate chip cookies (French, right?) but even that got switched out. Now everything's peanut butter cookies. The labels for about 30% of the dishes were wrong. I think 90% of the mislabeled foods were in the desserts section, though.   I'm not a big fan of seafood, but their crab legs appear pretty fresh. In fact, the chefs cook the pasta and other dishes right in front of you. Other sections (ahem- desserts), seem to have stacks and stacks of premade, stale food.  Overall, the scenery and overall environment were pretty good. I apologize for my inconsistant opinion. There are few good things and there are a few bad things.   One of the last things I'd like to mention is that some of the French is incorrect. I suppose the creators just wanted to put conjugates so Americans could understand it better. Although I might be wrong on my part. I'll have to ask my teacher for confirmation. It's not a big part of my review, and this isn't affecting my rating.  EDIT: After going to the Bacchanal buffet, I have to add another star for its price. So much cheaper than that one. I don't care if that buffet had more options- it wasn't worth it.",

I went to the Total Rewards desk to buy the pass and as my partner has diamond status we waited in the short line.  We were told that we needed to buy the pass at the buffet.  We made our way to the Caesar's buffet, waited in line for a while, though shorter than the general line we waited for about 15 minutes, there, we were told that there was an extra charge to  eat at the  Caesar's Buffet.  We decided to eat at the places included in the pass, so we made our way to Le Village Buffet at Paris.  There, someone that works there told us that there was no separate line for Diamond members, so we waited for about an hour, (only to later find out that there is a VIP entrance including diamond members).    The food at Le Village was not good at all.  The crab legs were frozen, not just pre-frozen, but still frozen.  The prime rib meat was over done and hard and most annoying of it all is that I got food poisoning from the clams and mussels    I ended up staying in my hotel room for a day and a half until I flew back home.  Going to that buffet ruined my weekend on Vegas.  Getting the buffet pass was a waste of money and had I not being as sick as I was, I would have tried to get a refund.  My partner had lunch at the Planet Hollywood buffet (included in the 24-hr pass) and hated it.    Because of the food poisoning, I would give this place no stars at all.",

The biggest problem was there was more empty dishes then full dishes. The meat carving station was entirely empty except this nub of roast beef THAT THEY HAD THE NERVE OF STILL SERVING TO PEOPLE! When I asked when things were gonna be replaced the employee said \"oh in about an hour\", he laughed and walked to the back of the house. After circling the buffet for a while nothing was being replenished. We aren't gonna pay $40 for old mash potatoes and salad. After explaining my concerns she expressed her apologies for the subpar food and she realizes they're not refilling dishes as quickly.   To Management, how about not filling up your establishment KNOWING that it's gonna be more than a hour wait for a BASIC buffet after the fact your customers pay. You can totally tell from the nonchalant attitudes from the \"cooks\" and from the frazzled demeanor from management that this is a regular occurrence. I understand at the end of the day it's a business but people are paying for a service that is complete garbage. I'm glad I got our money back, we will obviously not be returning.",

The eggs at the station looked sad like they've been sitting for a while.  They ran out of bananas.  The donuts were stale.   The smoked salmon was grey.  Even the servers looked miserable.

In fact, if  you can avoid going during the holiday it would be even better. The upcharge for a holiday time pass is so not worth the quality of the food you get at any of the buffets.  Pros: 1. Coffee was readily available at your table, perhaps because it was brunch time? 2. Crab legs (cold) offered at the salad station, and was being replenished so you never run out. 3. The crepe was still very tasty and good.  Cons: 1. Many food items were mislabeled or misplaced. The bacon was in the scrambled egg slot, the beans were in the rice slot. Meat station had sausage as an option but no sausage in sight. The list went on, and on, and on. 2. Crepe station offered 3 sweet and 3 savory options. One of the savory option was not available because the kitchen did not prepare the ingredient. Why would you offer an item that was not available?! 3. Omelet station was closed, even though it was Friday, brunch (went at 11AM), holiday season. A bummer since I would really have loved some freshly made omelet. 4. Many similar dishes offered at different stations. I noticed a baked fingerling potato at one of the station, and at another station baked sweet potato was offered. Or one station would have scrambled egg and the other station egg quiche. Not much variety.  In conclusion, for the quality and the food items offered, I felt it would be an ok buffet if you are paying around $28 per person (only because crab legs were offered). If there were no crab legs, I would not be paying anything above $20 per person for a buffet this disorganized and limited in options. And I certainly WILL NOT purchase a Buffet of Buffet pass during holiday season ever again because you are getting ripped off for good.",

There is only one stall in the ladies room and the toilet was leaking.  The floor was all wet,  it was disgusting.",

Not only was the food terrible (hard as a brick prime rib & pork loin) but barely anything had labels, too many empty dishes, server never came by to clear our table so my mother did it herself, rude service behind the crepe counter, and there was even a line forming just for a refill of the crab leg counter for about 10 minutes. We (the others in line and I) had to step out of line to ask for assistance from several different workers and none of them helped nor cared much. Macarons were HORRID. How??? This is at PARIS. LOL.  I would've had a better experience at Home Town Buffet. Do not go here.",

TIP OF THE DAY -  make room for the Fresh Crepes...You call the filling, they make it fresh WIN WIN WIN!  Traditional Prime Rib, Snow Crab Legs, Mac n Cheese, Salad Bar and endless Desserts are just a few reasons to try Le Village!   Seafood Bouillabaisse is a must try at Le Village, loaded with and perfectly seasoned.  The ambiance is super fun with the that eating outside in the town square feeling, the ambiance is one of the best in Las Vegas for sure.

The food was just ok. It wasn't terrible but wasn't up to \"Vegas strip\" standards. I expected more especially because it was in the Paris hotel.   I tried a little bit of everything for the most part. The crab legs were good (tip, ask your waiter to bring you a fresh batch to your table)... Upon request they'll do so. Otherwise you're picking scraps from the ones out at the free for all.   The salmon surprisingly was the best dish there. The desserts were great. Everything else fell flat. Chicken was dry, sauces looked old, sushi was bland... A lot of other dishes didn't look appealing. Would I return? Probably not.",

Surveying our table, we collectively ate Eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs with lox and asparagus, spinach quiche, veggie frittata, bone-in ham, carved slab bacon, pears poached in burgundy wine, roasted Brussels sprouts, croissants, apple danish, French bread, strawberry crepes, tiramisu in mini chocolate shells, a fruit tart, cafe au lait, macarons, fresh fruit, milk, and orange juice. It was all good, and there were more options we simply didn't have room for. Additionally the French Village decor is delightful. We arrived at the desk at 10:55am and they still granted us the breakfast price even though we could have paid $12 more (total) for 11am lunch, so that was also nice. Enjoy the details and savor the moment. I think people who aren't happy here spend their lives waiting for a perfect pink sunrise with a flock of doves flying out of it and harps playing. We thought this place was pretty terrific.",

I am a Las Vegas local with dietary restrictions and have gone to many different buffets downtown and around Las Vegas and never had an experience like I just had. Upon entering the buffet I told the hostess that I needed to speak with the shaft due to dietary reasons. I had to wait over 10 minutes for the chef to come to my table well everyone and everybody else was already eating. When I told him my dietary restrictions the chef laughed and asked what does he expect me to eat... And that was my question to him I said.  I told him I cannot eat cheese or eggs and that I do not eat meat and follow a vegan diet.. He right off the bat said unfortunately there's not much that I could have on the buffet... And I told him I've never had an issue at any other casino with him making customize items for my dietary restrictions. ( nothing crazy- just vegetables with oil instead of butter, pasta with no cheese, some type of potato, maybe something else?!) but wasn't offered anything and said that everything was pre-made and couldn't be altered... Also when we walked around the buffet he told me I could eat stuff- for example- rice pilaf. I know from experience rice pilaf is usually cooked with chicken broth, so I asked him that and he said well yes it is. 3 times I had to tell him I DO NOT eat meat.   I found a bowl of hummus and asked if it contained dairy in it - as some/most do. He told me they do not make it here so he is unsure of what is in it. When I asked if he could find out he said that he would have to go all the way to the other end of the casino to find out... Really you are a Chef and do not know what is in the food you are cooking.   On top of that, I went to get the only thing that I could eat- fruits and veggies and they were out of raw veggies completely.   The service was also very slow for how NOT busy they were. Our waitress did not refill drinks and forgot to get other drinks we ordered. Plates were not refilled and would have to walk on the other side to get them.   This also is not just because I can't eat a lot of foods- the other two people in my party were not satisfied at all. I would rather go to a buffet for $8 bucks instead of blowing over 30. For being a diamond member , I would say food was not good( so I heard) , service was not good, and overall very disappointed.   The reaction/rudeness of the chef was unacceptable and troublesome that he was not knowledgeable about what they were serving. Also, I am sure I am not the only person in the world who has dietary restrictions.  The only good thing about this place was the interior decorations.",

I want that experience without the price and with food that isn't dusted with cigarette butts.  Well it sounds like Le Village Buffet is the place for you!  *cheesy smile*  With ~$30/p for dinner, you just can't beat it when compared to other buffets that cost much more than that per head.    Because I'm one of those cheap and uncouth buffet goers, I can't say I'm a complete fan.  Their seafood options are really just cooked mussels and clams, plus the usual cocktail shrimp.  I didn't get to fist pump the air like I cheated the system after downing a plate and a half of bivalve molluscs.  It's just not as satisfying as a plate of crab legs.  If you are, however, one for variety and a plethora of options, Le Village has you covered.  From sushi rolls to bouillabaisse, macarons, bratwursts and a hand sliced steak section, there will be something for you and lots of it!",

The service was the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars.  They take your drink order when you're seated.  Most buffets have the drinks there when you return.  Well, we had to ask again for them.  Also, flagging someone down to get another fork was challenging.    These are minor things though as the food was amazing.

    "text": "This place was terrible all the way around.   I was visiting from out of town and we stopped here for dinner after the Jersey Boys show. We heard the food was good and worth the money. We had 8 in our group and each of us paid individually. Only AFTER we paid, we were notified that parties of 8 or more automatically have to add 17% gratuity. Barbara, the lady standing and taking tickets insinuated (rudely) that she wanted us to go back to the cashier to repay with the 17% added to each persons ticket. We asked if we could add it at the end or use cash and she huffed and puffed while taking all of our tickets and pulling the hostess aside to see how to handle our group.   Not sure why NO BODY mentioned the gratuity until after we paid and there were no signs posted until after we rounded the corner where the hostess was standing. Not our problem that they had poor placement with their sign or that the people taking our money didn't bother to give us a heads up. After that issue, the staff was rude to our whole group. They ended up slitting our group into two and sitting us at opposite ends of the restaurant, then proceeded to give us dirty looks our whole meal. The \"waitress\" barely said two words when she came to ask what we wanted to drink, 3 waters and one Sprite. She dropped off a tall jar of water for us to refill our drinks ourselves and never came back once to refill the Sprite or check to see how things were going. And they wanted us to tip our server 17%? The only person worth tipping was the gentleman that came and grabbed our empty plates. He was the only kind person on their staff.   On top of all the drama, the food wasn't very good and we sat across from what I'm guessing is the wait staff room and the floor was a mess, which I have included a picture of. I will 100% NOT be returning to this place if I come back to visit and I think any one thinking of dining here should be aware that the staff is rude.",

    "text": "If it wasn't for the \"Le Crepe with Nutella, bananas and hazelnuts,\" this place would warrant a 1-star rating.    Over the many years of having so many people talk about Vegas buffets being the best, I had to try at least once while I was there. I had so many expectations but maybe that's the problem here.   First off, we were seated almost a block away from the actual food stations. This place really makes you work for the food. The food is sectioned off into several stations based on the courses (appetizers, main and dessert). I always go for the seafood and meats....you figured you get your money's worth that way. Seriously who wants to get full on cheap salads?  I got a little bit of everything. I'm a dabbler. The meats were salty and dry. The seafood was just okay. I didn't even touch the salads. But their coffee was good. Overall I felt there wasn't much love put into the food. It was all about quantity versus quality while I'd much prefer the latter. There is something about buffets that makes people pile on everything even the food is awful. I am guilty of this but I ended up not eating 80% of what I had on my plate.  As my evening was not turning out as expected, I decided to try their crepe station. Per recommendation from my friend, I got their nutella, bananas and hazelnuts. I have to say that dish made up for everything else I had before there. It was freshly made infront of me, so how can anyone mess that up?   Now that all the glitz and glamour is gone.....it would take a lot for me to come back to this place again.",

They also have a crepe station that is cooked to order. I had the bananas with nutella. I felt the banana slices were a bit too large, it would have been better if it was a bit thinner.  The dessert bar also looked amazing, but I was definitely disappointed on the macaroons. They were soooo many, but didn't taste great. The outer shell tasted like a fortune cookie.",

Albeit we got there at 9:45 (they close at 11:00) but they should still have the same food at 9:45 that they have at 3:00 available.  The potatoes were not cooked through, it was like cutting through a rock!  They didn't have hot crab legs instead they chilled the snow crablegs and split them for you and they were over cooked.  The only good thing on the buffet were the shrimp although they were peel and eat.  I suggest you walk through before spending hard earned money on this slop!  Wish we would have done that!",

    "text": "This may be a shocker to my long-time Yelp buddies, but I don't have any pictures of my $31.99 weekend dinner. If you want to blame my ravenous, cranky behavior, go right ahead.  Anyway, the all-in-all experience of this buffet in Vegas was not shabby at all. The quality of the foods in each station were standard. Variety was alright and there were some items that I wasn't akin to after taking a few bites, such as all the steak offerings -- whether it's beef or fish. Not surprisingly, there were some edibles that frankly didn't appear to be edible to a superficial foodie: e.g. would you trust overly cracked macarons from the sweet stations?  Yet, I stumbled upon some foods that were quite flavorful. For paying dinner price I'd surely nibble on the Duck a L'Orange and ravage through the Crab Legs, even if some limbs were semi-frozen. Last but not least, I certainly found foods that grabbed my taste buds in awe: the addictive Truffle Mac & Cheese, anything with shellfish (which I was personally surprised), salad, cocktail shrimp, anything with veggies, and the scrumptious Brandy Apple Crepe.  This buffet is definitely not for 1st timers in Vegas and for those who need tons of flavor in their gastronomic life. However, for the joyful company (i.e. family members) and for a last-minute or convenient AYCE that doesn't come with a heinous, excessively serpentine line, Le Village Buffet should be considered.",

Starting off with our table, we were sat in an area where it was open to the passerby's which not only made eating extremely awkward with the people staring and a great trek to the food.  I felt constantly under pressure and self conscious eating with everyone watching.  BAD EXPERIENCE!  Next the food, it was truth be told barely edible.  70% of all the food was way too salty even the desserts.  A highlight of their failure are the macaroons that were clearly left out for too long.  However the few fresh ones were tasty.  Another downfall is the bathrooms, my mother had to walk out and find a bathroom elsewhere due to the long wait time.  I had very high hopes for this restaurant but came out ultimately disappointed.  It was sad for me because the decor and staff were so amazing.  I really wanted to love this buffet.",

The macaroons, which were supposedly one of the highlights of the buffet, were gross and disgusting. I went to the Medley Buffet at the Orleans, and it was eh, but still much better than Le Village. The food here in general has way too much sodium, the restaurant itself is in a fake Paris Village that is way too hot with no AC, and the service is bad, cause if you ask for more than 1 drink, the waiter will glare at you. Not a good place to eat at, and definitely doesn't stand out against other Vegas buffets.",

    "text": "Like many others we had been here many years ago. My what a difference. We came back to try it after a horrid experience at Spice Market and an average experience at Bacchanal. It now seems most of Caesar's properties are suffering from the same poor leadership. I think that if Mr. Frissora made a surprise visit, some folks would be called into the principal's office.  We got there around 3:20 or so. There was no line, so the young lady asked us to come to her register. As soon as we did, another lady said we needed to go back to the other register and wait for the third one to come back from somewhere. After a few minutes, I saw this third one come from across the way. Is it normal for folks/cashiers to leave the front unattended? Weird.  We were seated by a nice pillar that obstructed views from 2 of the seats. When I asked, the hostess said we cold move to the opposite table, but I had to point out it was the same situation but with the pillar on the other side of the table. There was also a semi full bus-cart right next to the table welcoming us to enjoy ourselves. **these come into play later  The food was not up to any standard. Dry, inconsistent and boring are words we used for hours afterward to describe it. Half of the lines were void of food and what was there was obviously just new piled on old (we got to see staff doing this - new fish just tossed on top of old fish, new potatoes scraped into the old bin, even the cold cuts were mixed up...one batch of ham was cut in half and the other batch of ham was whole). Many of the items that were there were so far overcooked, after one bite, you set them aside. The duck (which was labeled as pork-although I know pork has no wings) was so dry, it had an odd taste to it. The mac and cheese had brown bits in it that we are still not sure what they were. Even the crab legs were still frozen...not cold...frozen. Anything with cream in it had an unusual sweetness to it. The only thing we completely ate was the prime rib and au gratin potatoes. These were great - everything else wasn't even diner food.  There were minimal desserts. Of the four sides to the dessert area, 2 of them were completely void and at least one of the remaining sides was 75% empty. The salad area, if you want to call it that, was an interesting place. The staffer working it had her plastic wrap - the nice big roll - right there on the countertop next to storage bins and in use bain marie's (soup pots). She also had her sleeves of souffle cups laying there, next to the bags of salad. This almost seemed to be a theme there. Lets put all our prep and cooking gear around on the surfaces...our guests won't mind.  They really want you to experience eating leftovers in a Parisian alleyway, so the floor is nice and nasty-littered with food scraps, paper and who knows what and they push these carts through at intervals almost like they are trying to recreate trams. Why would anyone decide pushing carts across an uneven floor is the way to bus tables/haul ice/haul dinner ware? Actually, one staffer made it extra special by parking his bus cart next to us again and then wondering off for a while.   Needless to say, this buffet has been removed of our list to EVER visit...and it is looking a lot like it is becoming an issue Caesar's wide. We have thought we would try Flavors (Harrah's) and see if this lack of training and management extends to all of Caesar's Entertainment F&B.  **will also be posting this to other review boards**",

She was always on top of everything and served us with sweetness and a smile.  It was amazing considering she was the ONLY server for the entire room and there were at least five other tables occupied (one with a rather large party) at any given time.  She never missed a beat!

There is no signage for where those with reservations should enter. I learned from the cashier that if you have a reservation, which I did, you should enter at the VIP entrance. How are people supposed to know this? I wasn't terribly put out because they had just opened and only about 20 people were ahead of me, but I've seen this line before be quite lengthy.

    "text": "I came here for Thanksgiving dinner with my family, so my review may not apply to their normal dinner hours.  We arrived at 6:20 to see a huge line and we were a bit concerned. We were seated at 8:40. Unfortunately, there were lines both inside and outside, as there were lines for the individual food stations. The line to get meat from the carving station took another 15 minutes. Lines everywhere!  I wish they had split up their carving stations. There was one person carving the three meats (prime rib, pork, and turkey). When people got there, they would ask questions about the meat, or ask what each meat was, or want specific cuts/parts of one or two meats and not all three. I think it would make for a better dining experience if they split up these carving stations or spaced them out more. The lines got so bad that a man (maybe the manager?) came by to try and get people to go to another station, where there was turkey. Most people stayed in line for the pork and prime rib.  Food quality was disappointing. The first piece of prime rib I got was way too well done. The second piece was rare and red in the center. The duck was really dry. The crab legs tasted so salty that I could only eat a couple. They also stuck to the shell, which made me think they weren't that fresh. I basically filled up on various roasted vegetables and sausages, which I could get anywhere for less than half the price.  I had heard so many good things about the dessert bar, but when I finally got to dessert, 1/4 of the station (gelato? ice cream?) was cleaned up. Of the desserts that were left, they were just the same handful of desserts placed at different areas of the station. The crepe station also had a huge line, and when I finally got my crepe, it was monster-sized (not in a good way). There was so much filling in there that my family of four people couldn't even finish one.  Since it was a holiday, we paid for the holiday price. Including tax and tip (the only saving grace was that the waitress came by occasionally to clear plates and refill drinks), it came out to $45+ per person. All in all, I'm disappointed that I came here for Thanksgiving. Not worth the wait or the price. Next year, I'll know better.",

    "text": "Came to this buffet on my 21st birthday. We picked it because we heard good things about it and it was cheaper than some of the other higher end buffets. When we got there, we noticed we can get a discount if we were a Total Rewards member, so we joined. It was like $1 off, but the membership was free so why not? You need to go to the casino to sign up though.   The line was not that long, but it took a while to get through. I think they were waiting for tables to open up so we could be seated. It took a while to be seated too.   The ambiance of the buffet was like no other though and probably my favorite part about it. I love how Vegas portraits different parts of the world and they did a good job at Paris hotel and this buffet. The buffet represented the 5 provinces of France and had some foods that are representative from each province.   The food was good, but not great. I enjoyed the hot meats, crab legs, and especially the desserts. Some meat was over cooked so it was a little tough and the sushi they had did not look fresh so I stayed away from that. The desserts were my favorite part. They had macrons, cookies, cakes, creme brulee, etc.   Not a bad buffet for one of the cheaper ones on the strip. Food quality could be better, but you get what you pay for. The night time French village setting really sets the mood.",

    "text": "Thoroughly unimpressed and actually a little bit nauseous.  We waited about 30 minutes to get in which was fine, however when we finally got in there were no plates at any of the stations. We waited and we waited and were told that they were bringing plates but we continued to wait for several minutes. In the meantime, they continued to let more and more and more people in so by the time the plates finally arrived, there were so many people waiting for food that you couldn't get anywhere near the buffet.    OK, so that finally settles down and we are actually able to get food. First, there were almost no signs letting you know what the food was so you really had no idea what you were eating. Second, several of the hot food items including the fish and green beans that I had were cold.  Then, I went over to get some crab legs and while I was waiting in line I was going to get some cheese off the cheese platter only to find a big dark hair laying across the cheese. I pointed this out to one of the ladies that worked there and all she did was pick up the hair and the piece of cheese it was laying on. It was just repulsive.  Also, they cut the crab legs in half which in theory could be helpful but really all it does is scatter little pieces of shell all over the meat.    The floor was sticky, covered in food and other debris. And, there is only one bathroom stall for the entire restaurant. Way overpriced for what you get. We would never be back.",

After a rather disaapointing Buffet at Rio the night before we where almost ready to give up on the whole buffet scene at Vegas. It seems people in this city prefer quantity over quality. NOT my thing.  BUT Then came La Village Buffet...the answer to Vegas mediocrity had been infront of my eyes all along in my very own hotel! (The hotel I was staying in I dont own Paris Paris...I wish!)   What got us to give another buffet a go once again?? Two things!!  1. We were famished.. 2...$5 all you can drink Mimosas...... need I say more??? ;) No...I need not.  It was a breakfast paradise and I am the kind of person who typically just has coffee and a pastry for breakfast... but this was enough to turn breakfast into my favorite meal for a day! A Crepe station, build your own bagles and lox, all sorts of eggs and fresh fruit lovely potatoes and hash......turkey and chicken sausage and bacon.....It was all great quality food as well and choice cut meats  .... this was really the best buffet in Vegas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So I just read my own review after about a year and... I think the company and the Mimosas really heightened the experience that night...  Still the best buffet I had in Vegas without a doubt though.",

It features some delicious French specialties like a very good cassoulet and a passable cioppino. There are several decent vegetable options too.  But the meats and seafood, including a carving station and grilled lamb are nearly all overcooked and barely edible.  Aside from a decent crepe station, desserts, which in a French setting COULD be dramatic, are largely the same sorts you would find at any other buffet on the Strip. Bland mousses and even blander custards.   If you are drinking alcohol, the unlimited drink option is a good deal.   Service was fairly spotty on our visit with long waits between drink refills and even longer waits for utensils. Not a bad choice overall, but I am still waiting to find the outstanding buffet in Las Vegas.",

Many macaroons which where soft and yummy but it was a small selection compared to other buffets on the strip.

I am generally an avid fan of buffets, especially in Vegas where spirits are up and alcohol is flowing. But in this case, I was sorely disappointed. To begin with, the line was looong, which is expected for Saturday brunchtime, but for some reason, it seemed especially long. When we were finally seated (I went with a group of 10) and began browsing through the food selection, I cannot say anything looked fantastic, although I did enjoy the setup and decor of the place.   DISCLAIMER: Our group was a little hungover, so my review of the food here may not be 100% accurate.   After picking at a few plates of food, my first impression was sustained. I attempted to try the crepes that all the yelp reviews were raving about, but the line was too long, or I did not have the willpower and patience to wait. The dessert section, which also looked impressive, did not hit the spot either. Many trays were empty and were not replaced during our time there.   3 stars are because the service was good, and despite the average-tasting food, my group still had a good time. Our waitress was friendly, welcoming and very willing to meet our requests, even if it was requesting 3 different drinks per person.   My end thoughts: Standard buffet, not too special, but not terrible. Would not go back though, especially with so many others to try in Vegas!",

I heard that the line can get a bit crazy at this place, so avoid peak lunch times.  - good for family - decent food but not a very large variety - French town theme - great service - high price - expect a very long line - definitely one of the dining places in Vegas that  I recommend   The price: $$-$$$. I got a lunch buffet with unlimited mimosa and champagne option for about $35 dollars. Thankfully, I thought it was totally worth the money.  Our waitress was very sweet. She was quick, friendly, and funny. We even left a compliment to the manager.  I had about 4 mimosas on the spot. Try them with cranberry juice instead of orange juice, if you dare! The waitress recommended it, but sadly, I didn't think I could handle anymore mimosa at 1'o clock in the afternoon. It sure does sound good to me!  Anyway, the food was decent. The presentation was very nicely done. I liked everything that I tried except sushi, which was dry and too fishy tasting (I'm usually a big fan of sushi). But then I figured it is probably too much to ask for fresh fish in the middle of the dessert.  They have Mediterranean, Italian, French cuisines and a salad bar. The dessert option is wonderful with creme brulee, bread puddings, ice creams, and more.   Some people apparently pay in the morning and stay until late lunch. I cannot see myself doing that, but that could be one of the ways to save money in Vegas. Plus, a cute French town themed atmosphere is always cute.",

I went this past weekend (7.14) around lunch time and let me say I've had better buffets at Hometown! First off the wait to get in was 30-40minutes. Now I understand it's a Saturday and at prime lunching hour so I was fine with that but then to not even be fed a decent meal, well that really grinds my gears!   Despite it's creative and Disneyland-esque atmosphere the place was a mess. It had a musty weird smell to it and everything just looked so drab. It was really quite disappointing. Thank god we had a fantastic and friendly server. We got up and did the obligatory \"tour\" before actually grabbing dishes and at the end I was like \"is that it?!\" For such a hyped up place the selection was lacking. There were several stations with flys buzzing around, children putting their fingers in the food and some items looked like they'd been sitting there all day. And the dessert section, HA!!, what desserts..?! It takes up a large area of the central dining area and so you'd think it'd be packed of different decadent desserts but it was all the same - stuffed with awful brownies, sad looking apple pie, itty bitty bland cookies and the ubiquitous frozen yogurt machines.   As for the food, well, it wasn't terrible. I had a pretty good crepe and decent roasted potatoes, brussel sprouts and french fries but I mean that's all ordinary food. This place had very little FRENCH about it. I think they need to rethink their branding or expect more customers with unmet expectations....",

I also tried the chicken and asparagus crepe and it was alright, but it could be a bit more flavorful. The rest of the food was all pretty lackluster. The pastries were clearly packaged and the eggs were mediocre. I feel like most breakfast buffets are not very good or worth the money, luckily I got a check in special for 5$s off (note, you need to redeem at the total rewards counter in the casino), so I didn't feel totally ripped off.

It's been years since we've been here (usually for dinner), so we were trying to change it up from our usual Bellagio or Caesar's Palace.  Despite the main floor being nearly empty, we were sat at a small table in a side room that looked run down and unkempt. The run down part I could attribute to being \"quaint, french country style\", but not the food stains on the wall at our table. Plain scrambled eggs, scrambled eggs w/ asparagus, and the quiche were ridiculously oversalted to the point of being inedible. Curiously, the frittatas and the eggs benedict were entirely unseasoned. I ended up having to chop up the frittata and mixing it with the scrambled egg to get something edible. Didn't try the made to order omelette, because there was a line that was moving very slow. The smoked salmon looked pretty sad, but tested pretty good. The onions that went with it very chopped very rough, and there was no horseradish to be had. The smoked trout was very fishy. The pastries we tried were ok, but all very light on sugar. I didn't mind it, but it was very one note.  Highlights were the slab bacon and the prime rib hash.  The most annoying part were the bussers clearing tables driving around carts piled with dirty dishes. The table next to ours had a larger party, and the cart full of dirty plates was parked a foot from our table for 5 minutes while the table was being cleaned and food debris scraped into the trash.  All in all, for $24 plus tax per head, it was a bust. Pay an extra 8 bucks and go to Bellagio or Aria, or cut the bill in half and go to a Station casino. Either way you'll be better off.",

Sanitation problems (would you like some roaches in your omellets?), dark and dingy dining area and food was substandard for the price that you pay. The staff even cleared out our table half way through brunch and left us with no table. Watch out Mr. Ramsey, some creepy crawlers from next door might find their way to your kitchen. Just turn around and go straight to the Bellagio, guaranteed you'll have a great buffet experience in Vegas.",

The negative on our experience was that we were quoted one price and when we showed up, were told a different price.  Plus my 9 and 10 year old children had to may adult prices.  AND they tried to charge us for a 5th person although there were only 4 people in our party.  All in all, I would eat here again for brunch if I was in the vicinity, but probably won't seek it out again.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas, but why did I only give this place 1 star?!? Because of the AWFUL experience I had in March 2011. I took my girlfriends here to eat on a Saturday afternoon, excited to fill my stomach with some French delicious-ness. We got through the line and we waited at the front to be seated. I felt that we were standing there for an eternity before we got seated at an awkwardly placed table that faced the line. Basically, everyone in line could stare at us as we ate. We felt uncomfortable and asked this waiter named DANRICK (tall, dark Philipino male) if we could move to a more secluded table under the faux trees. DANRICK gives us a look and tells us that the area we requested was reserved for VIPs (which was understandable). He then goes on to say that we can go back to the end of the line to request to be seated in the VIP section. I said, \"No, that's not necessary,\" but he continues his tirade by picking up our receipt and pretends to take it to the front so we would have to go back in line. I repeated that we were fine where we were and eventually he went away. I have never been so UPSET at the service I received. I even complained to our waitress, who acknowledged that he was like that and she apologized for his behavior. DANRICK'S behavior was inexcusable and intolerable. He ruined our day and he needs to be fired.",

Its more then obvious management obviosully does not care for its visitors to the le village buffet.  This past saturday was my first and last visit to the buffet. I found many items either luke warm or cold.   Lots of vegetable and fruit items were either rotten looking, and sour tasting.    Lots of entrees did not even have the lable, so you didn't know what have the items were.   Aside from the terrible food. You find employees lacking basic customer service skills,  They cant say hello, and its obvious there miserable.    I rember two couples being seated before me and my mother, even though we were ahead of line.  Last  but not lease.   I learned not to judge a book by its  cover.  I twice went to the flaminog hotel, which is clearly an aged building.  However, i found the buffet exceptionally good for the price.",

It turned out that this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  When we finally got to eat, we got the tail end of the brunch period, and they were switching the brunch food out for dinner food.  If you want to save money, come here at the end of lunch on a weekday, and eat the dinner stuff for relatively cheap.  There was a lot of expensivish food, like crab legs, bouillabaise, and various carved meats.  All of these were pretty good, although not really anything to write home about.  Unfortunately, I decided to fill up on the gnocchi, risotto, and onion soup (which were quite good) first, which didn't leave much room.  The desserts, including the crepe station, were awesome.  Probably my favorite part of the buffet.  Overall, the buffet was quite good.  Although the food wasn't spectacular, I had a lot of it, and it was definitely worth the $25 or so that I spent.  Also, brunch on weekends includes champagne.  Unfortunately, I don't really have any basis for comparison, as this is the only buffet I've been to in at least 3 years.  I'd probably also like to try the buffets at Wynn and Bellagio next time.",

Then the server was nowhere to be found I didn't even have water to drink!!! I thought boy the food didn't seem all great in representation but then the service being horrible... I hope you guys read the reviews and train your employees better because I don't get this sh*t service at other buffets such as the Rio... maybe you all should gather one day and have a field day of training and watch and learn how you are suppose to treat your guests... Didn't even get the chance to fill out the survey... the place was not even busy nor crowded... are u stereotyping me thinking I left didn't tip so I'll clean the table out right away... Too bad I tucked my five dollar bill back in my purse I hope the next person you do that to raises hell on you with a manager! I did have the 24 hr pass and don't waste your time at Cafe Lago Buffet at Caesars Palace either... thats where I headed to after and it was WORST!!!

At first I thought we were going to be disappointed as we waited in the pending to be seated bench for over 20 minutes as we saw servers slowly clear tables one plate at a time. Soon after, we were seated at a table with no silverware and no one taking our drink orders. When we asked for assistance, Mindy came to the rescue.  She is a doll of a person, a happy-go-lucky lady with the swagger of a G6, sashaying through the tables with her trusty bottle of champagne. Thankfully, she didn't mind that I would finish the champagne before she finished refilling the table, thus getting second helpings.  The food was top-notch. I died on crab legs. Their sausage was so good too, as is their chicken, duck, buttered broccoli, and mashed potatoes. Skip the french onion soup. It looked gross and tasted bland.  However, the hat is tipped to Mindy.  Thank you Mindy for encouraging us to get the most bang for our buck when it came to 3:30 and the last round of champagne has come. Your Grace Kelly charm and Tina Fey wit was not unnoticed, as well as all the strings you pulled to make our buffet experience beyond all buffet experiences.  That little extra effort makes all the difference, and the $$$ in tips.  Though I have thus returned back to my suburban enclave, I've left my heart in Las Vegas.  Je t'embrasse",

The crepe station is awesome though, and the guy making the crepes was both nice and funny.  There were a lot of mussel options, so if you like mussels you might enjoy this place a little more than I did.  There was nothing terrible about the experience, it just did not wow me in any way.  And, as silly as it sounds, if you are going to have sushi you should also have pizza.  One more annoying thing was the guy trying to sell you the picture of you that they take before the meal.

They said to go ahead and get our food and our drinks (water and wine) would be ready when we came back.  We went to the buffet and then sat down with our loaded-up plates.  It was almost ten minutes before they brought wine and water so our food got a bit cold while we waited.  Almost everything was over-salted.  The wine was basically grape juice flavored.  Definitely a \"you get what you pay for\" situation. Do not skip the gravy!  The meat is extremely dry.  If you are sensitive to salt, do not go here!  Honestly, the best dish I had was grape leaves.  The prime rib, chicken, and lamb simply weren't good.",

    "text": "This was an awesome buffet. The atmosphere is adorable. The food is served out of little storefronts that each represent one of the provinces of France and feels as if you are really eating in a cute little French village. Our table was actually situated \"outside\" a small house so it felt like dining al fresco without the bother of bugs or dirt.  The food itself is amazing. Not all of it is French, but the dishes that are not are pretty seamlessly integrated. For example, there were a couple of Italian dishes at the Provence station, but because Provence borders Italy that made sense and didn't distract from the overall theme. For me, the crepe station and the dessert section were by far and away the best parts of the meal. The crepe chef made both sweet and savory varieties. I had one with mushrooms, cheese, and spinach that was to die for. As for the desserts, 90% of them are french classics such as creme brulee. That's right, all you can eat creme brulee.  The pricing gets a little expensive. A basic adult buffet is around $30 dollars, but you can add on an extra $12 for all you can drink beer and wine (dinner) and champagne and mimosas (brunch/breakfast). You can also pay an extra $10 to jump the line.  The line to get in is also something worth mentioning. If you are in any kind of hurry splurge on the line jump. The line moves relatively quickly, but even on a weeknight it took my husband and I a good 45 minutes to get through it.  As a last note, if you are in the mood to splurge a little, I highly recommend getting the Paris Balloon Cocktail. All it is is your choice of a margarita, daiquiri, or pina colada served in a ceramic glass shaped like the balloon that serves as Paris's logo. The drink was expensive, but the bartender put in enough rum to get both my husband and I buzzing.",

The pastas were crusty and bland.  The biggest disappointment was the desserts.  Wouldn't you think a French inspired buffet would have the best desserts?  The cakes tasted like store bought birthday cakes.  Everything was dry and bland. I've eaten better food at a school cafeteria.  Do not waste your money at this buffet.  The Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan) and Aria buffets are much better.",

    "text": "$32.99 for a Thursday dinner. One glass of wine included pp (cab, chardonney, or merlot). $1 off pp if you use your TR card. One TR card can give you that discount for up to 5 ppl the TR staff told me.  Wine was good; it didn't give me a headache like most red wines do.  The food is overall more dressed up American food than French. About 20% of the selection looked to be traditional French dishes.  Service is quick about taking your plates away but slow to refill your water, get you a beverage, or clean an empty table. Service also seemed overwhelmed/annoyed if you asked for things. I asked one staff member for water and in response, she silently pointed at the server I should be asking. I was turned off by that and would have liked her to provide a more polite response.  What is bizarre is that there is a line to get in that winds around twice in front of the buffet, but if you go inside, there are consistently about 20+ tables that are empty in the back section of the dining area. Why did we wait in line for about 20+ minutes to get seated when there were so many empty tables near the serving area?  They make crepes right in front of you. It was good. Would have loved to finish mine except I was beyond full.  The best dishes there were the pork and apples skillet and the seafood bouillabaisse. There is also a carving station for prime rib.  In the dessert section, there is a variety of cookies, eclairs, cookies, ice cream, flan, creme brulee, macarons, and fresh fruit. The basket of pears was full of rotting pears. The flan was good; not the jell-o kind.  Ambiance is okay. The place is a little bit dark.",

We got in line a little bit before 2pm, and finally after about an hour we were finally seated and got to roam the food stations.   None of the food stood out as particularly amazing, but I'd have to say that the highlights were probably the brie and bacon macaroni and the prime rib. I was in a breakfast mood so I also tried the eggs benedict, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, and a crepe. The bacon and sausage were good, but the scrambled eggs were way watery and had a very odd consistency. The eggs benedict was pretty good, but it seemed like it had been sitting out for a while.   However, we were a bit disappointed when we had been sitting at our table for about 15-20 minutes and our server told us that they had completely run out of champagne. How do you run out of champagne for a champagne brunch? That made absolutely no sense to me. They offered us wine after a while, but I was really looking forward to the champagne....boo. It would have been nice if they had comp'ed us something at least.   If you do decide to come here, I'd come early so they don't run out of champagne on you. If you're going to do multiple buffets while you're in Vegas i'd probably do this one first, because compared to the other buffets i've been to in Vegas (Mandalay Bay and Bellagio), the quality of the food just wasn't there.",

Anyway, this buffet restaurant is on my \"avoid it\" list. And here is why.   First, it costs $27 per person and there were not much food variety or quality. Some of them were even hard to eat. I visited this buffet on weekend and the only shellfish items I saw was just cold alaska crab legs and they were extremely extremely salty and not fresh.   Other hot food items were just average and so were their deserts. What really annoyed me were there are some items that they reserved for VIP customers only, and these items are not really special. Chocolate covered strawberry or hot crabs are not something I considered luxury. You can find these items available for everybody at most other buffet joints.",

The food was just okay, sure you get as much as your glutenous heart/stomach can desire but a lot of okay isnt as good as just enough of great. With so many options on the strip for dinner $30 per person can get you some pretty amazing meals. They have a lot of italian and french inspired foods to choose from. Yes they have crab legs, but they are cold and not that big. Also prepare to bring you ingenuity because they dont provide crackers or those handy small forks. Even the roast beef and steak are on the lukewarm side. The pastas are decent but again the quality of the selection of food is only okay at best.  Look around for a better quality of food buffet or more than likely an actual restaurant. Plus then you can avoid all the people running into you while your trying to pile your plate high.",

    "text": "This is the perfect buffet for when you want to feel like you're at Disneyland but in France but in Vegas and ready to consume six plates of food.  If you've been to Disneyland, I'd compare this atmosphere to the Blue Bayou. It's trying to bring the outdoors in, but you feel kind of strange about it but you're glad they tried. The ceiling is painted like a blue sky and that's really the main factor that brought my sister and I here on a Monday night. This was our only buffet of our trip, and we looked at a bunch before deciding. I'm really glad we picked this one - the Bellagio was so ugly inside, and even though it has rave reviews, who wants to be in a dim, themeless, windowless room that you paid $40 to be in? Not us. We'll take a cute little village atmosphere, please and thank you.   Highlights of our food: the mashed potatoes, the truffle pasta, the prime rib, the sushi (don't be scared), the creme brulee, and the crepe station.   Bummer items: carrots (not done enough), sweet potatoes (also not done), beet salad (lukewarm), duck (too tough).  Being that this was my one and only Vegas buffet and we kind of fasted all day for this, I took about six trips back. They cleared our plates real quick and were good about refills. Between the two of us, we had five plates of dessert. FIVE. Get the strawberry crepe, not the apple one. I tried both for you. Get two creme brulees so you don't have to go back when you eat your first one in five seconds flat. Get all the desserts and have one bite of each, you're in Vegas, don't feel guilty, don't be modest. They live for your food waste.  And for goodness sake, ask to sit under the painted blue sky. Don't be stuck in a little room when there are classy fake trees and storefronts awaiting you.",

Please pony up and spend the extra $5 for a better buffet ($27.99 crazy) or please gain a little more energy to walk as far from this place to a better buffet. Ok...let me get off my soap box.   The difficult part, I brought my cousins from Mexico City and they were too caring to tell me this buffet sucked.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE.   For the food, i would priced at $14.99, instead of $30.99 I want my $16.00 refund please. Plus tax.

Once we got in there the food did not disappoint. We both eat low carb. I felt there was a good selection of meat, veggies and salad.

The dining area my party was seated in had tables that weren't bussed for 10+ minutes, and when they were finally cleared, they went right to a trolley that was sitting in the dining room less than 20 feet away from where I was eating. Of course, a trolley full of dirty dishes and food waste stunk up the dining room, which immediately killed my appetite. To make matters worse, the food options were extremely disappointing.  They had about 7 varieties of potatoes though, so if you want to spend $40 on a buffet to fill up with potatoes, this is the place for you. The prime rib was tough and filled with gristle, essentially making it inedible. The other meat options were dry with no flavor.  The only saving grace of the meal was the crepe.   During our meal, there was a party of 20+ in the same dining area, who made our meal incredibly unpleasant. They were being extremely rude and disruptive. Our server (Mitzi), dealt like them with a pro, but you could tell she was incredibly overwhelmed by the amount of tables she was in charge of. For some reason, she was working alone, having to serve as well as bus tables. When I spoke to the manager about it, he was extremely dismissive and said \"She's slammed like this all the time, she should be used to it\". I was disgusted by the manager's attitude toward his servers, especially since this buffet was in a nicer hotel and was not cheap!  Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed by both the food and the management. I would NOT recommend this buffet to ANYONE. When others are saying \"RUN, DON'T WALK\", they are not kidding.",

    "text": "Yay brunch! I came to Le Village for the first time for brunch on a Friday morning during spring break, around 11AM. ~25 minute wait for my party of 3. Not too bad. At least the line was moving the whole time.  I'm a huuuuge breakfast food person so this buffet was right up my alley. Some quick tips:  Love: crepe bar, whipped cream, $12 unlimited mimosas, bacon slab, coffee, fresh strawberries, quiche, sausage. Solid selection of extremely delicious breakfast/brunch food.  Watch out for: too many good carb options make it easy to fill up real fast, too many egg-based things (frittatas, omelettes, scrambles, etc) that all basically look/taste the same.  Bottom line, Le Village is a solid buffet in Vegas. Not spectacular/must-stop, but for a reasonable price per person, get pretty good food and drink. If you do the Buffet of Buffets, definitely put Le Village buffet somewhere in your lineup.",

We waited in line for about 45 min and find SO MANY empty tables throughout the restaurant when we get in!! LOUSY SERVICE and NOT RECOMMENDED!! You're better off trying another buffet.

    "text": "Just had a horrible experience at Le Village Buffet today! Go to any other buffet if you have a choice, food and service is deplorable here!!!  I was looking for a buffet to enjoy by myself and decided to give Le Village Buffet @ Paris a try. After waiting for an hour to get seated I got some food that quickly disappointed me.   The made-to-order ham & cheese crepe was rushed out so quickly that the cheese didn't even have a chance to melt and the prime rib was either very well done or completely rare. Still this wasn't what ruined the entire experience since I was aware that I was going to one of the cheaper buffets in Las Vegas.  The service in general was mediocre, but the entire experience got ruined when I got up for a second round of food. After returning to my table, I found out that the bus boys had completely cleared out my table less than 15 minutes after I had gotten seated!!! On top of that nobody seemed to think that this was an issue! The bus boys did quickly put my table back and give me new table setting, however I asked to speak to the waiter and manager regarding this issue and neither seemed to care about the fact that after I waited 1 hour to get in, I was being forced out within 15 minutes. The only thing that the manager said after I talked to him was that I was welcome to continue eating anything from the buffet (something that is already my right after waiting 1 hour in line and paying over 30$ for the buffet). I couldn't put up with the attitude that I was getting from the manager and left afterwards.  TLDR - Food is mediocre at best, and the service is the worst that I have ever experienced at any buffet. Any other restaurant would be a better option then Le Village Buffet. Save your money from eating at this place and go to a better one.",

Of course everything isn't for everyone and there will be food you don't like but what we liked, we had lots of!  The crepe station was SO DELICIOUS, we had the Banana Nutella and the Strawberry Ricotta. They were both delicious but the Strawberry Ricotta beat out the Nutella one by a hair. Haha  The only downside was our server, it was like we didn't have one. For some reason he had a problem with serving us, but didn't have an issue refilling and speaking with the other tables around us, odd, but nevertheless, we will be back!  Nina was very pleasant as well! Greeting us and making sure we were in good moods before we even sat at our table.  We arrived at 5pm and there was about a 10 minute wait for the two of us. As we left, around 6pm, there was a long line out the door and this was during the week. So get here asap!",

Well this last time we went, 1/8/17, we enjoyed our meal before we went to see the Love show at the Mirage. We had nothing to eat afterwards, and had one beer each during the show. After about 3 hours our stomach's started to not feel well. My wife actually had to throw up in the restroom as we walked back to our hotel. We got back to the hotel well we both felt sick. This continued on onto the next day. It was definitely something we ate at Le Village Buffet in Paris Hotel.   I noticed there is no way to reach the hotel via email/customer support and in the past, calling a buffet to explain an experience like this is more hassle than its worth. However there was no point, I had thrown away the receipt and wont be returning to Vegas for a while anyway so a complimentary meal wouldn't have sufficed. I would like to however warn people that it may not be the best option to eat here. Not only did we get food poisoning but in general there are better buffets like the Spice Market buffet or Rio carnival buffet.",

The French village decor was cute and very fitting. The cheese plate and soup was a perfect starter. The Salmon was cooked perfectly, the crab legs were pre-split and easier to eat than most buffets. Neither had the slightest fishy taste. There was a wide variety of vegetables, both sweet and savory crepes, and the creme brulee and macaroons were on par with those served at higher end French bakeries. The staff was very nice and attentive, we could hardly slide a dirty plate to the end of the table before someone was picking it up. As far as mid-priced Las Vegas buffets go, this is one if not THE top.",

We started with salad:  various greens, cold shrimp, cheess, and bread; then, main course:  Alaskan King Crab legs (my favorite), oysters, venison, stews, soups, grilled veggies, baked chicken, pork; then for dessert:  what else?  the World's Best Crepes cooked in front of you with your choice of fillings.  And, for those interested, a huge selection of french pastries and wines -- the like of which you only expect in a high-class, expensive, and exclusive hotel restaurant.  And that includes the world-class service to your individual table.  I recommend you get a speed pass early in the day that will help you skip the long lines for lunch and dinner.",

So when I stayed at Paris recently, I knew I had to go back to Le Village for brunch.  Whenever I walked by, there was a long line of patrons waiting to get in so I ended up eating elsewhere. On my last day at Paris, I decided to wait in the line to get in for what I was expecting to be a good meal.  Especially after seeing the crowd of people always waiting to get into this buffet, I was under the impression that it had to still be a good place to eat.  Boy was I wrong, after almost a 1 hour wait, we were seated in one of the small dining areas that are located off the main dining room and had a waitress that was not very friendly.  On top of that, the floor wasn't particularly clean and the silverware had spots on them.  The food itself was not good.  There was a variety to things to select from, but none of it tasted particularly good. None of it!!!!  I thought the crepes or the pastries would be delicious given that it's \"Paris\", but they weren't.  I felt like I was eating at a bad diner.  What a shame!  The quality of this buffet has definitely gone down over the last few years and I don't know why people are lining up to dine at Le Village.  I will not be returning to this buffet again.",

And pardon me....French Buffet?  I don't think so, it's more Italian than French I have to say.  I guess those carbs from pizza and many types of pastas do fill you up, that's why they fill the buffet with carbs, smart move to get more $$$ from you for less huh?  I don't think the French are that into eating that much carbs, fellow diners are very rude, and this buffet is sure not worth the 30+ we paid for.  Rio/Wynn/Bellagio is much better!",

The service was very timely and the waiter that helped us was always available and cleaning the plates as patrons finished them. The selection of food was good as well. Plenty of options for all different palates. I enjoyed the truffle Mac and cheese, crab legs (no butter for some reason), and the chicken de provance. The pastry chef made excellent macarons and creme brulee. The crepes were awesome too, they had both savory and sweet options. The price is reasonable and justified for the quality of food you can get. A crepe alone is a third of the price you pay to eat.

Thankfully the Prime Rib was not on the rare side (I hate that), BBQ ribs were also good. Lots of potato dishes for this carb addict to enjoy :) Delicious desserts upon desserts Creme brulee, Cheese cakes, flan, apple cobbler, I could go on but I wont because it would be a ridiculously long review. They had a number of dishes I'd never heard of and sounded French which I wanted to try but by the time I'd finished gorging myself with the familiar there was no more room :X  There are many more buffets in Vegas I need to try but if I find myself hungry in the vacinity of the Paris again I will certainly stop here to eat again.",

Different dishes of potatoes. Breakfast style of course. Not just the plain boring hash browns you find elsewhere.   Different dishes of eggs. I loved the variety of eggs dishes.   Im not a crepe person. Long line didn't want to wait. Yeah, theres an Omelette station. And wait!!!! a bagel toasting station with cream cheese, lox, capers, tomato, and onion -- just like how Einstein Bagels makes em. Sold!  Breakfast at Paris for me from now on if I'm ever up at 9am again in Vegas. I think this is my first breakfast buffet ever..... I'm usually not a morning person, i love to sleep in, it's my therapy!

    "text": "So here's the deal. We came here for breakfast and it wasn't great.  The service: It was terrible. I could not get a server to refill our waters and orange juice to save my life, and what we were given was warm. I hate warm water, soda, juice, milk, even coffee. I like my drinks ice cold, so that bothered me.   The food: Eh... it was okay. It was not worth the $25 per person cost, that's for sure.  Several types of eggs and potatoes along with bacon, sausage, mini French toasts, mini pancakes, croissants, muffins, bagels, fruit, etc... is what they had.  I think the only reason to come here and pay this price is if you plan on eating several full plates, which we didn't. We didn't eat that much at all because it was mediocre at best.  EXCEPTION!!!!! The one exception is I did decide to try a crepe.  I got the #1 which was nutella with bananas, hazelnuts, and whipped cream. Okay, this thing was f*****g Delicious!!  With a capital D. It's the only reason I'm giving the two star rating. However, I'm sure you can find a restaurant that is much cheaper and get a wonderful crepe.  Also, after we left my boyfriend started feeling really sick and had to make several trips to the bathroom throughout the day. So while the crepes were good we'd never come back due to price, blah food, and the fact that my boyfriend got pretty sick.",

Make sure to make reservations on opentable and you'll save yourself a lot of time waiting in line. We were also able to get a spot in one of the little rooms so it didnt seem as crowded.  Prime rib was delicious, crepe was all the fabulous things everybody says on here. Don't waste time on the sushi ( I mean really? Sushi in a Paris themed buffet?) and the Creme brulee was one of the best I've had   The place is super cute and the staff was actually really friendly and attentive. I'd definitely come back but only if I got another groupon deal.   Happy eating!",

    "text": "Full disclosure:  I'm not much of a buffet fan boy.  When it comes to food, I'm more of quality than a quantity guy and - since I'm paying for it dammit - I prefer my food brought to me rather than the other way 'round.    That said, I've allowed myself to be dragged to the buffets in almost all of the major Vegas hotels (Bellagio, Wynn, Four Seasons, the Venetian, etc).  And in each case I left stuffed but incredibly unimpressed.  Buffet food is almost always the most bland, pedestrian, overcooked, lukewarm dreck.  And I just can't get much of a hard-on over crab legs, sorry.  Then I tried the the Paris buffet.  What a hidden gem.  Instead of a bacchanalian orgy of tasteless dross, I found a casual French buffet featuring surprisingly high quality cuisine.  The dining room is set in a Disney-esq recreation of a French country village, complete with stone buildings and a simulated blue sky (with clouds).  Scattered amongst the faux architecture  are various food stations, each representing a culinary region of the country.    Note that this isn't an American buffet in a French theme park;  Much of it is quite authentic (at least to this gastronaut).  You'll find mostly familiar fare (crepes, quiche, Coq au vin, etc) as well as  a few unique offerings you may not have tried before, all surprisingly tasty and well made.  In the center of all this is the dessert station, strategically located and sporting numerous decadent French mini-pastries (if you were looking for frozen yogurt and sprinkles, sorry you're out of luck), which are continually refreshed and therefore not stale (as with many buffets).  I'm a dessert junkie, so this is my favorite station, one I generally return to more than once in an evening.  There is almost always a line to get in here, so prepare yourself for a 30min wait at peak times.  In my experience, the best time to avoid the crowds is ~3pm.  If you don't mind eating early, you can generally walk right in.  Note that I don't want to over-hype things;  This is still a buffet. Not everything knocks it out of the park, and the food is certainly not going to compete with Bouchon or Le Cirque.  But if you have to do a buffet while in Vegas, this is your best bet, IMHO.  Worth a try the next time you're in Sin City.",

    "text": "Veggie and pasta lover? Definitely come here.   Meat lover?  You may want to try another dining locale.  Mmm...this place was awesome.  I'm not normally a fan of buffets- usually there's just too many different types of foods that my stomach can't handle all at once.  So the fact that I was able to eat here (and eat LOTS), and not be totally sick afterwards is a good thing.    They had a decent variety of meat, none of which looked too appealing.  Honestly, I like meat, but I would be in just as much heaven with pasta and veggies.  Probably why I liked it so much here- every vegetable dish was cooked 'til perfectly tender and thoroughly slathered in butter and garlic.  In my book, that's definitely the way to go.  Heart attack city disguised in greens and other leafy matter.  Similarly, being an Italian stuck in an Asian body, the pasta dishes were amazing, covered in lots of oh-so-yummy marinara sauce (my fave).  Try the sauteed mushrooms.  Try the grilled Roma tomatoes.  HEAVEN.    Also of worthy note- $2 fabulous looking (and tasting!) mimosas and $5 also fabulous looking (and tasting!) bloody marys.    The restaurant itself has a nice feel to it- outdoorsy-ish and set to look like Paris (or what I imagine Paris would look like).  Cobblestone is always a nice touch.  Wait staff here are very friendly and came to check on us several times throughout our meal.  I tried Le Village using the Buffet of Buffets pass, but even without the pass, I would come back.  I basically ate until I couldn't eat anymore.  A+++",

We have tried many of the buffets in Vegas but always return to Le Village, at least once and often a couple times during every trip there (the buffet \"next door\" is our second favorite!).  The ambiance is quaint and charming with the setting reflecting an outdoor French cafe atmosphere looking up into a blue sky.  Relaxed - ready to hit the food line!  While Le Village may not have as huge a selection as some of the other buffets in town, the quality of the food most definitely exceeds most of its competitors.  We have noticed in recent years that they no longer offer as many French items as they once had but, again, what they do have is of the highest quality, and when you can see them cooking it right there in front of you, you know it's fresh!  The breakfast buffet is wonderful and includes every breakfast item imaginable!  One of my faves are the freshly-made Belgian waffles and Eggs Benedict.  Yummy!  And being the coffee-holic that I am, the pot of coffee that is left on your table for instant refills is all I need to make me a happy camper.  If nothing else, the crepes alone, which are made to order, are reason enough to give this place a try - they are to-die-for!    You won't be disappointed in Le Village Buffet!!  :)",

    "text": "Buffets are interesting.    Some times, you go and eat a ton ignoring the quality of the food.  Other times, you go and eat as much as you can knowing full well that you're scarfing down some good restaurant grade grub.  Le Village Buffet falls kind of in the middle.    The Ups: Good Crepes  The downs: Crab Legs not always fresh tasting and hard to eat Desserts selection is sub par (Minus the crepes) Service  The middle grounds: The prime rib, chicken, veggies, pastas, rice, etc.  So what, why?  When you have so many choices of buffets in a place like vegas, there's no reason you should go somewhere you don't love.  Honestly, most the food is just okay and one of the biggest appealing things for me is the snow crab/king crab legs.  Since this place's weren't that good, it's just okay by my standards.  That and the waitresses that served us on multiple occassions were not attentive.  It could be that we had a big group but it could also just be that they forced us to have the 18% tip and they didn't want to earn it.    In the end, I'd go back if others want to but I'd rather go somewhere else.",

I'd rather go have a nice meal at Bouchon for roughly the same price.  Anyway, at least they have snow crab legs.  I love me some crab legs.  The dinner dishes are somewhat fancier than other buffets like at Rio (i.e. you won't find hamburgers and chicken fingers here).  The duck l'orange was pretty good, the rest of the meat pretty average to slightly above average for a buffet (i.e. completely mediocre outside of the buffet world).  I do recommend the brie cheese and bacon macaroni, sausages, mussels, and crepe station.  In the end, I got my fill and spent about an hour of my time there cracking open crab legs.  However, the dishes aren't spectacularly executed and I don't think it's very good value.",

I like the fact that they had a crepe and omelet chef that were available. I thought that the crepe was a bit over-rated but the omelet was deliciously made well. I liked the egg benedict and the waffles. They also had many different choices of breakfast meat (like 3-4 different types of sausages, bacon, ham, etc). They also had many types of egg dishes (like the fritata, scrambles). They also had many choices of bread, muffins selections.  We liked it so much that we went back for dinner. Their dessert selection was awesome. They had many pastries like the macaroons, creme brulee, lemon raspberry tart, lemon meringue pie, etc.",

    "text": "About 10 years ago, Le Village Buffet knocked Rio World Buffet out of first place for my favorite buffet in Vegas. My favorite was brunch because we would go in and make sure we got our $25 worth of complimentary champagne. Now that Caesar's has bought Paris, there have been some subtle changes to the buffet. First off, they started charging $12 for beverages (OK, I'll take some responsibility for that one). Still a pretty reasonable price. I think the actual buffet price has gone down a little, so it makes it fair for those who don't imbibe alcoholic beverages. The food was always every French dish you could think of from Alsatian sausages and cassoulet to salads nicoise from Provence, it was all there. Now, they seem to have simplified the selection (although they still have cassoulet and salad nicoise) and made it more like every other buffet in Vegas. This was most apparent when I saw they had sushi rolls near the cold seafood. Really? Although I'm a little disappointed in the sell out, the food is still really good quality and has enough unique dishes that sets it apart. However, that first place spot is teetering on the edge. I'm going to see what Baccanal buffet has to offer.",

    "text": "Not to Be Missed  I have no idea what some of the bad reviews are about as my visit was the complete opposite of what some have claimed. Here's the items I tried: snow crabs, boiled shrimp, prime rib, string beans, mixed greens salad, French macaroons, berry filled crepe topped with real whipping cream fixed fresh, creme bruele. I'm a very picky foodie, and a cook myself. I know what's good because I have had plenty bad. I eat out 80% of the time. I'll start off with the details of some of the items that were outstanding: the prime rib was beyond excellent, cooked to perfection, tender at every part and juicy full of flavor. The string beans were awesome. Any cooking fool knows string beans are hard to season. Not these. They were fresh cooked and flavorful. The snow crabs were cut lengthwise for easy shelling, which I have never seen on these kind of cabs at other places. Usually at some places you get rubbery crabs that don't crack open and are mushy and flavorless. Not here. The meat comes out easy as it is exposed being sliced long ways. Even the ones that had no cuts could be cracked and the meat slid out easy, and yes they had flavor, not watered down. The shrimp were easy peel type and had flavor by themselves. The French macaroons were superb as was the creme bruele; all food was as good as one would expect from a 5 star gourmet restaurant, not a buffet.",

Right when you enter, the warm village ambiance embraces you and draws you in; a self-playing piano further sets the Frenchy mood with jazzy tunes.  The food was wonderful. From freshly-made crepes to mini quiches, and from meaty mussels to succulent pork roast, Le Village offers a wide selection of delectable French-inspired dishes. One item that stood out to me was the red-wine poached pears that were at the waffle bar. They perfectly complemented the crispy waffle.  I'm deducting one star due to the cleanliness. My table was not fully wiped off when I sat down. Especially because the lighting is so dim, it's hard to tell if everything (plates, silverware, cups) is clean.   Overall, I enjoyed dining at this buffet!!",

The coupon was good even though we were not Paris Hotel overnight guests. Worth an ask if you're going to go to the brunch. Food was mediocre, honestly. The made-to-order crepes were fine, though the strawberry filling was \"meh\". Fresh sliced ham was good though it had been sitting out for a while (mind you we got there at 9am).

    "text": "This place has really gone downhill. It used to be one of my favorite places in Vegas, but it saddens me to see what they have done with it. They walled off an entire section where they used to have more stations for food. They used to also serve delicious little individual cast iron dishes, those are gone. Most of the stations had empty spots where there was supposed to be food, but nothing was there. They also replaced a lot of the options with cheap vegetables. I'm ok with serving veggies, but these were just steamed ones like carrots, potatoes, Brussels sprouts. Nothing was done to them, just simply steamed with no flavor. Looking for French options at a French buffet? Good luck, they removed all of French dishes. Crepes are about all you can get that is French and there are better crepes over at the crepe place not too far from this buffet. The spread here could easily be out done by a family potluck.  I'm so very disappointed. This place always held a special spot in my heart and now to see it like this... I honestly don't know why they ruined it. Country Time buffet has more flavorful dishes and variety. I can no longer recommend this place. I'm upset I recommended it to people already since the last time I ate here was 2 years ago. The fact it has done a complete 180 in 2 years amazes me. It wasn't like this before. I don't even know how to get across how deeply upset I am. It's such a shame. If you want a good buffet for a similar price (cheaper, actually) go to Cravings at the Mirage. It was better than this 2 years ago and it is now hands down way, WAY better than Le Villiage now.",

    "text": "One word: Fail  Having eaten here many times since the buffet opened up a number of years ago, I have to say that it has been on the decline to the point that, unless the owners do a major overhaul (I.e. new management and new chefs), I highly recommend people to avoid this place.   I have eaten at a large number of buffets in Vegas as well as around the world from \"no frills\" to 5-star establishments.  For a venue like Paris, one would expect to have a four or five-star eating experience.  However, I have to say that this buffet compares to some of the el cheapo Downtown Vegas buffets that costs  the price.  In the many years eating at buffets, this is the very first time I did not go for seconds and left not full. Here's why:  Food Quality All of the main entrees were WAY to salty.  I mean to the point of inedible.  The roast chicken, roast pork, and sauteed fish were very dry. The king crab legs looked as though the crabs were bulimic - and also extremely salty.  A number of food items were also mislabeled.  I was there around 4 PM. About 30% of the entrees and sides were not replenished.  Instead, there were many empty trays with bits and scraps of whatever was there before.  From the looks of them, many were empty for some time as the sauces in them were caked on or dried up. The cooks behind the table didn't seem to care (more on that below).  To top that off, the food area was atrocious. There were bits of food, sauces, etc. all around the area.  Yes, customers are sometimes messy but it should be job of the people working there to constantly keep the area spotless.  Even the low-end buffets do a good job at that.    I used to say that their desserts were one of this buffet's strengths.  Sadly, that's not the case any longer.  While I think the made-to-order crepes and creme brulee were not bad, everything else was average to downright terrible. Such was the case for their macarons. You would think being a French-themed restaurant that this should be a highlight.  It was like eating a hard old cookie.   Staff and Service I think I know why the food was so bad.  From the cooking staff to the servers, the majority of them looked miserable, like they were there just for their paychecks but would rather be somewhere else.  The carver at the meat station never cracked a smile or a \"hello\" to anyone.  He would just glare at people as they asked for a cut of meat.  The person making the crepes made people feel like they were an inconvenience to him.  Many of the servers walking about were like lifeless zombies.  While I was there, I saw a customer ask for the manager, apparently very displeased with something.  I wonder why?!  One other thing I noticed, while I estimated well over 1/3 of the restaurant was empty, there was a long lineup outside waiting.  My theory:  Create a long lineup to give the illusion that this buffet is real good, which will attract and make people want to go there.  I don't believe this strategy will work for long.",

From cut crab legs to spicy sausages. Everything was cooked to perfection they also offer for 12.99 all you can drink wine and beer and Mimosas and champagne truly worth the time that you will spend here trying every item of food and as well they're amazing desserts. I have to say if you have a bad experience here or don't think the food is good try the other buffets around town and you will see that Le Village Buffet has the best food around",

It gets super busy as it is a popular stop so get there early or make reservations if you dislike long waits. No Asian or Mexican choices BUT about 80% percent of what they do have is very tasty. Of course the crab legs aren't the biggest and the prime rib can be a little on the dry side of you're doing a late dinner BUT for the price and the amount of choices, you cannot go wrong. Desserts are also decadent, from personalized made to order crepes, to macaroons and other tasty items you will find something to retry multiple times. Will be back!",

    "text": "I came here recently with the fam after a recommendation from a friend that we should give it a chance again. The buffet at Paris was actually our go-to place for probably 5-7 years in the early 2000s. Its relatively cheap and the line doesn't take too long as long as you aren't here at exactly noon for lunch. However, we stopped going here for a combination of reasons, but the two main ones: the food quality decreased and the servers managed to pour three drinks on my mom during one sitting.   So after almost a decade, we came back because two different people told me it improved. I would whole-heartedly disagree. Several dishes looked like they were from last week by how dry and crusty they were (no mushrooms are not part of the food group that should get crusty). The variety didn't take a turn for the better either. The only real saving grace is the crepe station, those were probably the best banana and Nutella crepes I have ever had or will have. I had 2. I wish I had 3 and tried some other flavors, including the savory options. The dude behind the station is a bit slow but good god does he know how to cook. The crepes are the only reason my rating isn't dropping lower.  Overall, there are better places to go to, even places that aren't buffets, I know - shocking. However, for the ~$40 a person, the service was still too slow, the food could use an overhaul, and the decor a touch-up.",

The crab legs are cut in half lengthwise which you would think is a good thing, but it's not. There was so much shell debris in the crab meat (sandy bits) it made eating them very unpleasant. Great strategy by the buffet if they didn't want people eating and enjoying the crab. It was the worst of all the cold crabs served at all the Las Vegas buffets we tried.  Instead of opting to use the 24 hr buffet of buffet passes here, we decided to purchase this buffet through groupon which included a \"free\" glass of wine or beer. We did the 24 hr buffet pass the following two days.   The desserts look cute, but I think we had better desserts at Carnival at Rio.   I dined here about 10 years ago and had a good experience. Things have changed. Bye good memories.",

The main deal to come to eat here, is if you want an AYCE for crepes (savory and sweet) and the desserts (custards, creme brulee, macaroons, etc).  The ambient is nice and the decoration makes you feel like you are sitting outside of a french town... it is very nice to have a good conversation with friends with no hurry and keep eating... ha ha ha  :)  The food is good... the meats like the prime rib and roast beef are very tasty. I like the Alsace station with the sausages and sauerkraut. There were two stations that were not well take care... the Asian and the Italian one, the food was not fresh and actually, some of the trays were empty for more than 15 minutes (I know that some of you would say... \"who comes to eat this in Le Village?, but if they have it,  it should be at treated as the same standards of the other stations).  I like the brunch because included the champagne and mimosas... really a plus.  The service was good and friendly...everything clean and they come often enough to take the empty plates and fill your drinks. The restaurant look cleaned too.  This was my third time here... and I will keep coming to satisfy my cravings for crepes until I cannot stand up... ha ha ha  :)",

For 24 hours after time of purchase, your buffet credentials allow you to literally pack it in, to be the glutton you've never before dared yourself to let loose and become.  This--and more!  Much, much more!--for only $59.99.  My review, then, reflects our complete and utter indulgence--our loosened belts and the imminent guilt--touring the Buffet of Buffets.  Paris' \"Le Village Buffet\": (Breakfast, $21.99 without the pass.) By far, Le Village has the best breakfast within the Buffet of Buffets!  It's quaint, themed as if you were strolling along the cobbled pathways of the French countryside.  The employees, especially here at Le Village, were hospitable and welcoming, coming to say \"hello\" over and over again, asking if there's anything needed...  Besides the great food--and I loved the waffles!--what continues to stand out for me was the way that the servers took notice and (I believe) really cared about their guests.  Rio's \"Carnival World\": <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/carnival-world-and-seafood-buffet-las-vegas\">yelp.com/biz/carnival-wo...</a> (Dinner, $34.99 without the pass.)

For a breakfast buffet on the weekend, it is around $24/person which is pretty reasonable. However the selection at the buffet is very limited. They do offer the typical American breakfast items as well as an omelet station. I was expecting a wider variety on the pastry item as this is located inside the Paris building. They also do offer a crepe station, which is very generous however that was pretty much the only selling point for me at this buffet. Everything was mediocre, food was just okay. I would definitely recommend a higher quality buffet even though you may need to spend a few extra bucks.",

However, I went here a couple of days ago for breakfast and it's pretty affordable being less than $30 but a lot of the items were overcooked and hard. It was also very crowded but maybe that's because it was Thanksgiving weekend and we didn't get a lot of service. There's also only one bathroom stall!  The crepe and egg stations had really long lines and there was a tip jar out. The only dessert they had out were some pastries, pie, and not so delicious soft-serve.",

It feels like you are sitting in the streets of Paris surrounded by little shops accompanied by an amazing food smell that makes your mouth water.  Service: The lady who seated us was quite standoffish, but our waitress was such a sweetheart. The waitstaff have the most hideous outfits though, I felt quite bad they were regulated to wear them. Our plates were always cleared when we got back from a trip to the buffet and our water and champagne glasses were always full. She even told us about the restaurant and the layout so we knew where to find food by type.  Food: The food was actually really good for a buffet, much better than anything I've witnessed back home. The mashed potatoes are real, the prime rib was tender, the crab legs are bountiful and cut so it is easy to access the meat, and the gravy was well seasoned. Salad bar was well stocked and I liked that they had such a large fresh fruit selection. The desserts are something to talk about, the apple crumble was amazingggggg, reminded me of my grandma's recipe (it was actually better but I won't tell her that).   I recommend this place if you have a group of people who can't decide what type of cuisine to eat, they have something here for everyone.",

The service was super slow to the point we had thought he went home and he actually did lol!  The prime rib was over cooked and the majority of the food was equal to Golden Corral's quality but with 1/2 the selection. Do not waste your money here. It's $13 more for Caesar's Palace across the street. Their buffet is awesome.",

    "text": "I have not been in buffet in ages in Las Vegas. Why? Because then I used to go they were getting worst and worst.  So after many years I have decided to go. Since it was Friday I started calling around for seafood buffet. Friday supposed to be a fish day, right? But not in Las Vegas. I Don't eat meat so the seafood is my only option.  After calling several places I stumbled on Le Village Buffet which was cheaper than other options in Caesar's Entertainment group and they told me on the phone that they had seafood with emphasis on crab legs. For some unknown reason crab legs is a big deal. I also wanted to see new display in Bellagio garden and Paris is across the street.  Well, good thing I have purchased all you can drink option. Food was not good. Those crab legs were extremely salty and skinny. Plus they were on ice. I even heard that someone asked if legs could be warmed up. I had to drink a lot of beer (which was draft and weak) to wash off the salt taste. The funny is that next to the legs is salad so the only option is a tiny plate.  This is supposed to be French place but hardly anything was French. They has sushi but only two. Both rolls. For the seafood it was tiny peel and eat shrimp and two types of fish, tilapia and salmon. There was mussels, shrimp and clams soup and there was paella with crawfish but it had sausage in it so I could not eat it. That was it. No crawfish separate, no oysters or anything else.  I would not call it seafood buffet, I would call it buffet with some seafood.  So, next I though I would have famous French pastries. There is a store here with a lot of pastries called French Baguette and they had a lot of pastries so I though I would experience some good deserts. NOPE!!!! Everything looked really bad and unappetizing. I saw someone carrying crepe so I had that and it was good. Service was good also.  I can't give Zero stars because it starts with 1 so I give 1 for service and 1 for the crepe. All together cost me over $50 for the food, tax and tip plus $9 for the parking. Total RIPOFF. I am from Los Angeles but come here very often. In Los Angeles for less than $20 I would have had better buffet (no drinks) and free parking.  Well, never again I am going to Boulevard buffets. I will spend a little more time on the road but will go to Downtown from now on. At least there I know there is better seafood buffet.",

Everyone in my family had no complaints with all the pasta and meat choices. If I had one complaint, it's that the prepared salads were too heavily dressed. But you have the option to create your own salad. And as all reviews state, the dessert bar is AMAZING.   Needless to say, everyone of us left stuffed and super impressed.

    "text": "HORRIBLE SERVICE. Bad food. Disappointment of an experience.  I get it, you're a hostess at a buffet restaurant that takes in hundreds of customers every day. It's 8PM and you're probably tired but when my family has to repeat to you for 5 minutes that my cousin has autism and therefore can't wear his buffet wristband, yeah we're going to start off on the wrong foot. Furthermore, if you have to degrade us in front of everyone by slowly repeating \"Make sureeee you don't lossseee the wristband\" more than 7 times, we definitely have a problem. My family's of vietnamese heritage but my parents speak clear english, there was no miscommunication, just a very dim hostess with a disgusting attitude.   On to the dinner food. I've pay less money for better buffets outside of Vegas. I think that's where the sub-par rating comes in for me. I believe that when you tag seafood as a characteristic of your buffet then there better be some decent seafood to back that up. Instead, all you get is some average shrimp and crab legs. If you want to call the imitation crab sushi as seafood, then i guess that's one more you can add to the list.   All the fish dishes were insignificant. From what i remember Salmon was dry and the sole was less than flavored. I could go on and on but I think we get the point by now. There's a lot of competition in Vegas and relative to that Le Village doesn't seem to be trying at all. The place looks nice and the decor is great but I'm here to eat and food is the most important thing.  Their macaroons fell apart on me :(",

    "text": "3.5 stars  I'm normally not a fan of buffets. Mostly because, while I eat a lot, I don't eat *a lot*, and I always feel like I'm wasting my money because I don't gorge myself at every station.   It's also been a while since I've gone to any buffets in Vegas, so my recollections of the food offered bordered on blah.  From what I remembered, you weren't going to have any outstanding culinary experiences, so I preferred to spend my money at sit-down restaurants with fancy menus and, you know...portion sizes.  Of course, our most recent trip out to Vegas turned everything around. We were there with my Vegas-loving, Vegas-knowing cousin, who pretty much planned every meal of every day, with the bulk of our meals happening at various buffets around town.  We came to Le Buffet for our pre-race morning meal, hoping to get our protein and carb fixes while sampling some of the other, non-racer-approved food items.  The wait wasn't terrible, which was a huge bonus. We really didn't want to stand in line for an hour or more a few hours before we were supposed to run 13.1 miles. I'd say we waited about half an hour before we were shown to a table.  The food was impressive - they had a good array of breakfast and lunch items, as well as desserts - and I enjoyed pretty much everything that I got. I only had issues with two food items: the cream cheese that I put on my bagel (with smoked salmon and capers) and the egg dish that I chose. The cream cheese had a strange flavor to it - almost like a \"dusty\" flavor, for lack of a better term. The egg casserole dish had ham and cheese in it, but was very runny and had a very sweet note to the base that I didn't expect and didn't like.  But everything else was good. I ate way too much, and then went back for more. How I thought that was a good idea, I'll never know.  I'm removing a star for our waitress and for the missing food labels.  Our waitress was terrible. I mean, *terrible*. We each ordered a drink (OJ for my cousin, coffee for my husband and a glass of water for me). She brought back the two cold drinks, and put the pot of coffee on the table, then walked away. Did she have a coffee mug for my husband? No. We kept waiting for her to come back with one, or to just swing by anyway, but she never did. We finally had to poach a coffee cup AND a pot of creamer from the table next to us, since she was basically a no-show.  She never came by to check on us, or to refill my (rapidly emptied) water glass. She DID, however, stop by with another glass of water towards the end of our meal. She totally could have completely changed my opinion of her by saying, \"Here's a water refill for you\", or something along those lines. Instead, she said, \"I have this extra glass of water that nobody wants. Do any of you want it?\"  Stellar!  The missing food labels were confusing. The buffet had been open for a few hours by that point, but the labels were either all wrong, or they were missing completely. It's not too big a deal, but when you're trying to figure out if that hunk of meat is beef or pork, a label would be handy.  Still, we enjoyed our meals and left feeling (overly) full. I think it's a good deal, for the amount of food offered and the price you pay. And I'd absolutely go back just for the macaroons alone!",

My boyfriend and I went in for dinner buffet a few days ago on Sunday, 12/11/11.  The line was okay at around 7:00 PM and we waited just about 20 mins to be seated.  The only highlights of the buffet were the pistachio macarons that tasted sooooo good and also the crepes (both sweet and savory), while everything else was just A-OK.  The snow crab legs were so tiny teeny weeny and sucked!  All the soups (creamy chicken, french onion, and vegetable soup) were freaking salty!  Service was barely acceptable since our server seemed a bit too busy chatting with others....  All in all, it's not worth 67 bucks for the two of us.  Will i go back next time?? nah. i dont think so. I have experienced better for about the same price mann.....",

Great salad bar you can make your own or they had some made like Greek salad and spinach bacon salad which I tried both And were really good.

Before you go in line, take 5 minutes and sign up for the total rewards card to get a small discount.   Wait time: long, even on non-peak times. Be prepared to stand for a while although there were many tables available.   Food: it was decent, but it doesn't stand next to the quality of buffets like the Bellagio. There are a lot of options and many have a French twist. I would say there are not that many options for children or picky eaters.   Desserts: had a wonderful homemade crepe, but the rest of the desserts are pretty standard I.e. cookies. There is good French custard.   Service: The waiters/waitresses are very nice and accommodating. They refilled very quickly.",

    "text": "We haven't been in quite a while and unfortunately the quality has gone way down hill. For $30 per person and $20 for my five year old, the overall experience was disappointing. We went at 2:45pm and had to wait twenty minutes to be seated for a party of seven. There was no line! (That should have been my first clue as there always used to be long wait times just to pay). The place was not busy and there were a lot of free tables.  I would have to say with LV hospitality, I was not impressed with our waitstaff. Forgot my drink, so she brought me water. She never came back to refill any bodies drink or get my drink corrected. My water glass smelled fishy.....I couldn't even drink out the glass. Gross! We ordered coffee for desert and ran out of sugar with no body to get us more. There was also still food on the table when they sat us. I overheard a server next to us at the end of our visit explaining champagne was included on the buffet. That would have been nice to know before we were leaving.  On to the food....I didn't expect a brunch menu at 2:45 in the afternoon on a Saturday....especially for the price! There were about four different sections of eggs and potatoes, and some kind of sweet bread breakfast (ie: French toast, pancake, waffle). One of the French bread dishes was so hard, even with vanilla sauce to moisten it, I thought I was going to break a tooth. No variety!!! Atleast with other LV buffets (not even as highly hailed as Paris) they have a lot more breakfast options. Lots of the food looked old and gross. I love seafood! The shrimp and crab legs looked gross. I just passed them up.....which I have never done!  The crepes I have to admit are still amazing! I also loved the macaroons on the desert section. However, the deserts are not as glorious as the used to be either.  I am such a foodie and would always brag about Paris. I am embarrassed that we took friends from out of town there!  I will never go back here now.....not even for nostalgia. The buffet is only worth $10-$15 per person! I can't get over eggs and potatoes for $30!!!!",

Granted, I haven't been over to Paris but seriously - these kicked the ones from Trader Joe's freezer's ass. Wooooooooooooo-wee those macarons. Once I figured out that these macarons were much better than anything else there, I just kept shoveling them into my mouth and passed out later from major food coma/sugar overload.

What we like about Le Village is the decor, always French Onion soup, creepes station, and many little other things that make ti worthwhile.   We find the salads to be fresh, and plenty of options. Desserts are among the best and a nice variety. However, the location of the desert station is the omelet station for breakfast and it is in an awkward spot.   Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, we have had them all and we just like this place. The line can be long unless you are Diamond or Platinum where you can just walk right up and get seated right away.   Staff is always attentive and friendly. Most bend over backwards to make your meal enjoyable. Just take a deep breath, and make sure you look over everything. Like we said, not the best in Vegas but really decent. The only drawback is that they keep raising their prices and for a Monday $29 is way too much for dinner when there are plenty of other choices. Sooner or later, people will stop paying these high buffet prices and things can go back to where they should be - around $20 at the most.",

It is on the smaller side as far as buffets go but they have the basics,  The crepe station is is not something that you see at a lot of buffets.  I'm a little impatient so the line for that wasn't worth it to me.  Our waitress was a little on the slow side and we had to flag her down a couple of times.  If I had been there for the mimosas I would have asked her to bring two at a time.  I thought the desserts were horrible.  There was nothing on the dessert bar that I found that appealing.  Next time I think I will try the crepe station as a dessert option. Overall not the best buffet I've ever been to but for the price point it met my expectations.",

    "text": "The crepes here are amazing.  The ham and cheese and mushroom were our favorites.  But the logistics of the long crepe line blocking the busiest entrance for the wait staff is piss poor planning on part of the management at Le Village/Paris Hotel.  PLEASE FIX THAT!  I felt bad for the wait staff already balancing a tray full of drinks, let alone lending their excuse me's and maneuvering between the long ass crepe line.  It's about $20 for lunch per person and it's $1 off with your Total Rewards card.  They had a disappointing platter (yes, one platter) of hard cheese that was hiding in the corner.  No brie or anything fancy here.  The French onion soup was pretty good.  The truffle mac and cheese was pretty good.  I would save room for the crepes, get a bowl of soup and move on to dessert.  Everything else was forgettable, including the large, cafeteria-type room with linoleum flooring in the back where we were seated.  When I came here a couple of years ago, it was pretty good.  But the experience was lackluster and I probably won't be back.  And the waitresses are wearing what look like longer versions of Halloween costumes, like Gepetto's wife.  They need new costumes, this is not Disneyland.",

Everything was great EXCEPT the chicken cacciatore, which consisted of chicken and tomato puree.  The crepes, salad, crab legs, salad and cream of chicken soup were amazing!  They even have sushi but I would suggest passing.  If you look at the fish inside the rolls, you too would walk away!",

However, they still had prime rib and shrimp cocktail which was good enough for me for $25.00. Now, the bad parts...  A salad bar with just lettuce pretty much. All the dishes were so saucy it reminded me of hoffbrau  food only. The \"sushi\" was just a rice roll with cucumber. The soy sauce was served out of a water pitcher. Haha. Embarrassing. The wasabi was runny.  There were a few decent pastries but for a French style buffet, you would think it was better.   Again, it was an affordable price, but not a good experience at all.   Decor was fun though.",

Came here for brunch and waited about 40 min in line which I didn't mind at all too. I told my friends and dragged them to Paris to have some crepes since it s a french place. Again waited in another line to get the crepe and here is the worse thing you see , the chef ( the Asian dude I think his name is ray) called me to take my order since I was next in line. Seemed like  we were in Soviet Union , aggressive , not cleaned, he messed up 2 times our crepes and had the nerve to ask for tips by pointing on the basket next to him. We put the 2 plates he made away and went another time in line to ask the other cook for crepes. The other chef Joey  was professional, knew what he was doing and took his time to ask us one by one  how we would like our dishes to be made. The lady in line behind us did the same thing , ask people to pass her so can go to Joey ( I hope I remembered the right names , and with no offense to anybody , the Asian chef is no good and the other chef A++++++++++++) .",

Nothing that stands out. A lot of duplicate dishes done slightly different. For $32 that's with tax for dinner it's not worth it unless your a gambler and get a comp or need a quick bite. I would pass plenty of other buffets to choose with bigger selection if your into buffets. I was in a rush and got a comp so ate it today but like I always say never eat at a Vegas buffet it's only a tourist trap with crappy food most of the time.  On a positive note service was decent.",

I started with soup, as soon as I saw it from a far being swirled around by the chef standing by, I felt a little skeptical about getting it. You could automatically tell that shit was all starch, because it was soooooo thick. It was soooo bland, blegh. Crab legs? That stuff tasted so old, it was frozen cold too. And there's barely any meat. My boyfriend took advantage of their meat selection. He mentioned the meat was tough and bland. We are a big fan of truffle recipes. And they had macaroni and cheese made with some truffle oil. It was gross, it was all butter and a tiny dash of truffle oil to make it smell like it.   The only thing good about this place, in terms of food, was their unlimited crepes. I was able to get a dinner crepe and a dessert crepe after. Both were OKAY.   The staff that were working and taking our plates were very sweet. They refilled our drinks as soon as they were empty and they took our plates fast. I was able to converse with one of the chefs making my crepe, she was cool too.   But, I thought this place wasn't good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even one of our taxi drivers said that this place is one of the worst buffets here because we told him how we ate there.",

I'm conflicted with the four star, but let me try to explain why -  It's hard to rate a buffet, you know, since they offer three different meals a day and also can have off days.  I'd have to say the breakfast is probably one of the best buffets on the strip, plenty of variety and the food is always a 4 star.  Lunch, again, fantastic selection, maybe lose a half star because there's nothing on the menu that really really shines, but then again, I don't expect a place to really knock me outta my shoes for lunch.  Le Village, for dinner however, I'd skip.  The selection is there again, but there are alot of other fantastic options on the strip for barely a few dollars more.",

The brunch also includes champagne/mimosas if you like, and is $27 per person.  The food is great, with different sections for different items.  I especially enjoyed the different choices of meats and the egg concoctions, and the desserts were delicious.    Our waitress was a bit slow about asking us if we'd like drink refills, and I wasn't crazy about the OJ,  but other than that, service was overall fine.   They have carved meats and a crepe station, which expectedly, were really popular.   Of course, everything is French themed, which was cute as well.",

Our most recent visit was this past week while we were visiting for The Shot Show/ AVN week for breakfast. The crepes were delicious and fresh, made to order. We tried one with fresh berries and another with ham and cheese - both delightful in our mouths. Variety of egg dishes and scrambles. Great meats, ham, sausage.   Exceptional service was provided from our waitress, busser and especially by the Restaurant General Manager, Mr. J. McIntosh. Mr. McIntosh was cordial, professional with a sense of humor. He really made us feel very welcomed and went above and beyond.   *Ladies* - Mr. McIntosh is quite handsome.

I loved that the outside had little bits of pistachio and gave it a nutty taste. The center has a lot of lemon flavored cream. MMmMMmmMm.... Pretty to look at as well.

I was thinking about the 24hr deal, but they jacked that up to $79 on the weekend. No thanks! My entire family left very unsatisfied. On a positive note, the crepe with the berry mix was very good.   Check out Studio B at the M. Almost half the price and twice the quality.",

Our waiter was ok...but refused to bring warm crab legs to the table which is one of the perks of being a \"diamond member.\" Finally had to get testy with him and he brought the crab legs. There were no soup bowls for the soup, and that's completely unacceptable at a buffet, keep your dishes stocked people! The food was ok...but seemed to be lacking in the quality I was used too.  I'm hoping that I just came on a bad day...I may give this place another try, but I was really disappointed in today's experience.",

I would say the star of this buffet is the Crepe station, with a choice of savoury and sweet, we tried several types and they were all very good. The price is not too bad compared to other buffets in the area and the wait not as long either. I would only come here again for the crepes and prime rib though.  TIPS:  Sign up for the Total Rewards program at the Paris hotel prior and you can get a discount on your buffet price per person/member. If you are not an american citizen make sure you have your passport as they take no other form of ID.",

Overall the food was OK - I wasn't particularly blown away and the prime rib was a bit dry and overdone (but I have yet to find a buffet that serves delicious mouth-watering meat!)  The standouts for me were the crepe station (you can get savory or sweet), the creme brulee, and the king crab legs.  The king crab legs were sweet and not fishy tasting at all - so if you can stock up on those, you will probably make the experience most worthwhile!  I went to 2 buffets which was this one, and the breakfast buffet at Wynn and between the two I have to say Wynn blew Paris away so next time I most likely will opt to try the Wynn dinner buffet.",

We were seated once we got to the front of the line and were unleashed into the madness. They had some fake rustic decorations but I suppose no one is really looking around while they're busy shoveling food into their mouths.  There is the standard meat station, crepe station, seafood (crab legs!), salad/fruit, some random sushi, pastas, and a crap-ton of breakfast food randomly spread out across all the stations. Service was slightly shoddy as the meat carver disappeared for a while and my waitress never brought me me orange juice. However the food overall was quite tasty. The crepe station was popular (don't get the savory crepes, it's never warmed up quite right inside the crepe) because of the freshly made crepes. The prime rib slab was HUGE and I ended up sharing with my friends. The eggs benedict was quite tasty, as well as the ham quiche/tart thing. All the breakfast foods were good, not great.  Shining star for me was the dessert station. So many varieties I couldn't make up my mind. I made a few rounds before I saw one of the workers roll in a huge cart full of creme brulees. They were delicious! I wanted to go back for more but I was way too full already. Overall, a great buffet. Was worth going to as we had the buffet of buffets pass. I would come back again.",

I had a banana crepe with Nutella, got chocolate syrup instead of Nutella without even telling me. Macaroons are ok, creme caramel was very good. I really think there is room for improvement.

Here are comments on a few of the dishes, but generally speaking - everything was mediocre at best. Our coffee was cold. None of the food seemed to be hot - just lukewarm. Even the crepe that was made for me wasn't warm in the middle. I wondered if it was safe to eat but thought, \"At least the chicken wasn't raw so it should be ok.\" The scrambled eggs with lox and asparagus were runny - not fully cooked. The bacon wasn't crisp. I can honestly say there was not one item that was served hot. The only topping for oatmeal was brown sugar. Even at a Fairfield Inn they put out nuts and dried fruit for the oatmeal!   There weren't any items that were exciting or different. Lots of potato dishes and basic breakfast fare. The meal was satisfying but was it great? Absolutely not. Truly disappointed for the amount of money paid. Would have been better off going elsewhere.  Grab a Lyft or an Uber and go to The Wynn.  It's actually cheaper and outstanding!",

The counter tops were greasy; from the looks of it there doesn't seem to be an eye for detail cleaning. The glasses over the food were smudged and had built up grease. In my eyes if you're not spending time cleaning what the customer can see, what does the kitchen look like where the customer can't see?   Our server was sub or at best. She seemed overwhelmed and uninterested. She ran around and wasn't attentive to our needs as a table.   Before we left I decided to speak with the manager due to the lackluster experience, I spoke with Bob who without hesitation issued us a full refund for 4 people. Clearly this is a reoccurring experience for him because he didn't even want to hear me out about the things I noticed that could have been helpful to their future experiences.   Needless to say, next time I'm in town I'll be skipping Paris.",

    "text": "I hate to have to write this review, I really do. As a Vegas local and former Harrah's Diamond card holder, I've frequented the buffet at Paris for the last 10 years. I hadn't been recently so I decided to make a reservation on Open Table so I could bypass the line. When I showed up at 5:30 pm on a Sunday night and there were ZERO other people in line, I should've known right then and there that something was amiss at this buffet. I welcome an explanation or at least an apology from someone in charge of this abysmal buffet.  This buffet used to be one of my favorites but wow, it was downright depressing! First of all, there were many empty tables inside (a sign of a bad restaurant for sure). The food on the stations looked old and tired, and there were many repeats on the bars (how many trays of mussels or rice or green beans do you need)? A lot of my old favorites have been taken off the menu in favor of cheaper fare (mashed potatoes instead of sauteed scallops, for example). The seafood section was horrible! Paris used to have huge, peeled shrimp cocktail but now they have a bowl of peel yourself small shrimp carelessly slapped in a big bowl. It's depressing how steep of a decline in quality has taken place.  It's almost as if the casino has simply given up on this buffet. None of the food was labeled and if it was labeled, it was mislabeled. The employees acted disinterested in everything. Many of the food trays were empty and stayed that way for the duration of my 2 hour visit. It was just sad. It's not like we went at an off time, we went at prime dinner time on a WEEKEND night!  The main reason for my 1 star review is for the lack of cleanliness. I eat at truck stops, street food carts and dives all the time so that doesn't usually bother me, but this buffet was DISGUSTING! Spills everywhere, drips all over, sticky serving untensils, glass crusted with crud -- it was NASTY. The ice cream machine had several used cones with melting ice cream running all over. Some stations had no plates. The crab legs were shameful -- they had been picked over and NOBODY wanted to eat them. It was so gross. I have photos and video to prove how gross this place was, see for yourself.   Quick, somebody call the health inspector!  The food and beverage department at Paris needs some serious help. Harrah's, are you listening? I am so upset that I paid an outrageous $30 per person for this. It's a dump. I can deal with less than fresh food, but the cleanliness of this place is embarrassing. Shame on you, Harrah's!",

First of all, I would have never paid the full price to go to this buffet ever if it wasnt for the Buffet of Buffets pass. I happened to stay nearby Paris so I thought I should come here.  I found three things I liked from here. First things first, I liked the interior. How they managed to have the buffet to look like a french village with the blue sky ceiling is pretty different from any other buffets I have gone to in Vegas.   Second, my server was so nice. She had a hard accent but she was so polite and kind. She was super attentive and checked up on us frequently. I really appreciated that.  Third, their crepes! Besides those two I mentioned, their crepes were the best! I only got to try the Mixed Berries Crepe since I was not as hungry as I should have been. My friend said their nutella crepe is super good too but I didnt get to try. My mixed berries crepe was really good. It wasnt overly sweet and the crepe itself was really moist!  Their prime rib was probably the best out of all the other buffets I went within Buffet of Buffets(excluding Bacchanal).  Will I come back? If I get a free pass, I will.",

I found a lot of the hot food to be cold. The cheeses were like something you'd buy from the grocery store- not particularly gourmet. I was unimpressed. If I were to ever come here again, I'd get a savory and a sweet crepe for dinner and skip most everything else.

All the other items were cheap quality. I do not recommend this buffet. I have had better at the sizzler.  I would of gave one star but our server was nice and tentative. So gave an extra star.",

    "text": "$34.99 for Saturday dinner, but if you're a Total Rewards Diamond cardholder or whatever that is not Gold, then you might get this buffet comped because Paris is part of the group.  I'd say my experience was just ok, not impressed at all for a Vegas buffet, given that the competition has gone up with the new buffets opening up like Wicked Spoon and the oh-so-glorious Bacchanal buffet that everyone should go at least once.  Anyhow, back to this Le Village buffet. The best part is the bucket of crab legs that we ordered for our table. Five of us of course devoured all the crab legs. I believe they were snow crab not Alaskan King but I do like both so I was a happy camper chowing down the crab! The entrees were not bad, edible, but nothing so great. I enjoyed their French onion soup, some pasta and the duck, but I could tell they didn't put any effort in there, which was quite disappointing.   Even more disappointing was the dessert section... REALLY? Cookies at a buffet? Are you kidding me? Their creme brulee wasn't done well. It's old and the caramelized sugar was not crispy anymore. I walked around the dessert booth twice and I didn't pick up ANYTHING. I just tried one bite of my friend's creme brulee.  No Vegas buffet is worth goin' if it ain't got good desserts.  Service was amazing though! Loved our server. So friendly, helpful and cheerful.   The decor of the buffet was ok. Honestly it doesn't look like a place to dine. Maybe because the walls don't go up all the way, I feel like I was still eating in a shopping mall, like a food court kind of deal. Weird. I know other buffets like Bacchanal doesn't have an actual room with walls either, but their decor is much more like a restaurant than a food court...  Bottom line, food not ok, not coming next time. Would not pay to come here, but since it's free, it's still an experience.",

I don't know if it is because it's a busy holiday weekend or the chefs just short on staff.  The presentation wasn't pleasing rather looks sloppy for the reputation.  The only thing I can say is the carving beef was tender and juicy also the crepe was tasty.  Rest are just ordinary stuffs that you can probably pay less if you go off the strip.  Overall was disappointed and I gotta pay extra for holiday price, not to mention waiting almost 2 hours to be seated.",

There was seemingly quite a wait, but it wasn't as bad as it could of been. We waited roughly 30mins. And the last call for food and drinks was 1045. They stopped making food I assuming around 10. Unfortunately the crab legs weren't getting replenished but we made up for that at another buffet. =)   The food was pretty good. It tasted like it sat out for a bit. I don't blame them for not having fresh ones. We came at the last hour and it was a weekday. I mostly came for the prime rib and my girlfriend came mostly for the crab legs. The desserts were okay also, my favorite was the raspberry cheesecake.   Our server Tam was very attentive, fast and friendly. We got the all you can drink alcohol deal for 12.99 and we didn't have much time so we kept pounding it. We had a mission and Tam helped us accomplished it. We were very satisfied with his service. He kept checking up on us and kept refilling our drinks and taking plates away when needed without even asking. You can tell he really cares about his section, great guy. We got blue moon on draft and the house red wine. Wish we had more time. We got full fast trying to eat and drink so many. We weren't able to finish our drinks so they let us take it out! Go Vegas! Haha.  Overall, wouldn't mind coming back here. Give it a try on a more prime day.  As long as we get Tam again =)",

The days of escargot and duck are a thing of the past.   They have reduced the amount of offerings and have added several kinds of pasta dishes which all looked unappealing, and now feature chili as a soup. Minimal poultry offerings, all of the vegetables were drowned  in tons of oil and were not flavorful.    Most of the food on the stations I also found to be pretty cold and the small staff that was working were not replenishing the food very quickly.   Seems like the price of the buffet went down as did the quality.",

    "text": "This review is for Le Village's breakfast buffet only. I have been told by many people how great this breakfast buffet is; but personally, I don't see it nor do I understand why anyone would think that it's any good. Maybe since I only tried one breakfast in Vegas and this was probably the best one compared to others? Seriously though, the only thing that I enjoyed here were the grapefruits and strawberries. Everything else was just simple breakfast food like bagels, oatmeal, bacon, ham, etc. and it tasted average, if not, pretty bad.    However, the setting, design, and decors at this buffet was just very nice. It was basically like you were in a French village underneath a blue beautiful sky. Also, it was cool that there were different food stations. There was a station where you can make fresh crepes and another where omelettes were freshly made just how you like it.  Here's what went wrong for me:   There were so many different variety of scrambled eggs at one of the stations. Everything had eggs and eventually, it was just quite overwhelming. Another thing was the fruits. Some of the fruits tasted weird and did not taste fresh at all. The grapes tasted soft and weird while the honeydew and cantaloupe were not sweet at all. Then the drinks, I tried the coffee, which tasted horrible, the grapefruit and orange juice, which both tasted horribly.   The service here was horrible!! Besides from our waitress (who was very nice and lovely), everyone else was so rude! So we ordered a crepe and wanted a regular Nutella crepe with nothing inside... We tried to tell the chef that, but he didn't hear or wasn't listening and asked what number. So we thought we had to pick a number and said \"one.\" Then after, we can just leave stuff out. I mean. It's not like I knew and it's not like he even started with the crepe. So when we asked politely if he can you exclude the bananas and such since we just wanted Nutella. He said with so much attitude, \"Don't say one then!\" Well excuse me rude guy! We did say what we wanted but you asked us for a number!   At the omelette station, the guy before us ordered two eggs prepared sunny side up. The cook broke both of them and asked the guy it. I just thought that was funny. Other places will throw it away and make new ones. Anyways, the point is, service here isn't good. If they didn't say anything rude, they just looked as though they were having the worst morning of their lives or they just hated working there.   Personally, if you don't have a buffet of buffet pass, I wouldn't try this place and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. But that's just me.",

The best things here is the prime rib, truffle mac and cheese and macaroons.  The crab legs (dinner only) are the same as planet Hollywood's with claws included. The salads were delicious and they had a respectable selection of salmon and sole fillet, cooked mussels and clams. Meats included delicious sausage, a carving station with stuffed lamb, prime rib, roasted turkey and roast beef, a tray of trip tips. There were repeated stations of clams. The scalloped potatoes are back instead of the mashed potatoes former reviewers have complained about.  I loved the sweet potatoes too! The crepe station is far better than planet Hollywood's remade stack - fresh and made in front of you.   Avoid the sushi at all costs.  Why there is an Asian section in a parisian buffet is beyond me. The cheese selection as people have mentioned is anemic.  But the truffle mac and cheese! Oh they were the highlight for me and the macaroons have a place amongst the best I've had - including lauderee. The delicate cookie crust has the perfect crunch and the chocolate filling is airy albeit a little too much and i had to scrap some off. The creme brulee is solid.  Skip the tiramisu.  The decor is reminiscent of beauty and the beast very cute and Disney like with the street lights adding to the charm.   While Le Village Buffet isn't the best in Vegas,  it's  a great option at the price point even more so when brought as part of the buffet of buffets!",

The make-your-own omelet station is neat, and the crepe station is to die for! They have fresh made to order sweet and savory crepes, and the peanut butter fluffernutter is my absolute favorite. We have never been here for lunch or dinner, but the options are great for breakfast.   We did have an issue here once, and that was with our waiter, Gallo, the last time we came. He was very rude to us, rolled his eyes at us whenever we asked for a refill (we did the brunch buffet with bottomless mimosas/bloody marys) & then told us out of the blue that he would have to \"get permission\" to keep serving us bloody marys, and made it seem like he was doing us a favor by getting refills on the mimosas. We aren't sure if maybe he thought we didn't get the bottomless or whatnot, but it was just a bad experience. Our group would stop him for a refill, he would roll his eyes, mumble under his breath, and take off before anyone else could ask for anything. (We were only a group of six, and none of us were even nuked yet so I know he wasn't thinking we needed to be \"cut off\", it was breakfast!) We aren't ones to generally complain to management (But will always leave a complement!) but that time we just had to let them know. They did handle it nicely though and we felt like we were heard.   This time, we had an awesome experience! Erica was our waitress and she was super nice, friendly, quick, and made us feel welcome. Definitely the best waitress we've had in Vegas, and we appreciate that!  So be sure to visit for the breakfast buffet! We highly recommend the 24 hour pass, so you can do dinner at Rio (or wherever you fancy within Caesars properties) as well, the price is totally worth it!",

You have to know what you're doing getting into a buffer, so I tried to overlook it.  We went for dinner so apparently there is a different crowd for brunch but this was decent.  They had a pretty good variety of items but the crab legs were sawed in half and pieces of shell were in the meat.  That bothered me a little bit.  They did have a very good selection here which is nice.  Just because I gave it 3 stars doesn't mean it's bad.  This is one of those buffets that is a great deal as far as the price for food.",

As you can imagine it capitalizes on the Parisian theme; the food is presented in several different areas modeled after the various regions of France (Alsace, etc).  Most of the seating is in a 'courtyard' setting - it's all inside the hotel but the roof is painted to look like the sky and there are imitation trees and plants designed to make it feel like you are sitting outside.   The food is varied and well prepared.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised by a number of dishes that are normally dry or bland when you find them at a buffet but were carefully done and very tasty here.  They had prime rib and crab legs - both were cooked just right and were delicious.   The mashed potatoes were just right.  They have a crepe station where they make them to order.   My wife loved their 'seaweed salad' and said it was the best she's had in a long time.  I've eaten here several times in my latest Vegas trip and I still haven't been able to try everything.   Drinks are included but they are delivered by servers.  Make a reservation to avoid the line and consider the 24 hour 'buffet of buffets' pass (gives all you can eat access to Le Village and seven other nearby buffets) to maximize your bang for your buck!",

Want Sprite, they have Sierra Mist. IMO, that's a bit odd for a buffet.  Most important thing to note: my group of six all ended up getting diarrhea. One of us actually vomited about six times the following day--and we didn't even drink!  Waste of money.",

Probably the best Flan my family have ever tasted (and we like flan) - so rich and melt in your mouth smooth and creamy. But the macaroons and creme brulee were definitely a very close second. The prime rib, stuffed lamb and crab legs were excellent (better than the others). The setting was also fun and unique.   Breakfast was also worth it. Amazing scrambled eggs and delicious carved back bacon, as well as ham and sausage!! Crepes made to order!!   If I were doing Buffet of Buffets again this would be Breakfast, lunch and dinner",

I didn't knock off one star because I went there twice over the course of a week, and both times I was fairly ignored by the servers. Each time they filled up my drinks on the first go, but then never came back around. There were other people who are also audibly complaining about the service, and went as far as shouting out of frustration  at the servers who walked by. The Paris as a whole has a great vibe, and offers free parking, which is becoming a rarity on the strip.",

By the time i went somewhere else to have dinner and finished eating, i still would have been waiting at the line at le village buffet :/  Second time, we made reservations (yes it takes reservations) came around 10am for brunch. Only waited like 5 minutes for a table. Most remarkable was the omelet station and the crepe station, very friendly chefs and very good food.   Next time i will skip this buffet or i mean its enormous annoying line and go straight across to eat a crepe at La Creperie or a baguette at JJ's Boulangerie ;)",

    "text": "Hi friends!   Here are a few (hopefully useful) comments and tips about this place:  1. The groupon is a big time money saver. I think each groupon was $44 (not including tax/tip obviously) and it included admission for 2 plus a bottle of wine. The wine isn't included usually but they were serving some complimentary wine while we were there. I don't know if they do that every night.  2. Get in line for the prime rib. It was soooooo good. I am pretty sure I had about half a pound of meat while we were in there. Delicious.  3. Just like in any buffet, dont fill up on carbs/salads.   4. The rest of the food was slightly to salty for my taste but overall it was still pretty good.  5. If you do get the groupon (and the bottle of wine), do not order their cab. That thing tasted like vinegar. Luckily there were 4 of us in our party so we have some chardonnay as well. The white wine was surprisingly smooth. Next time we'll get 2 bottles of that.  Overall pretty good buffet. The food was good, service was good, and the location inside the Paris couldn't have been better.  The only reason I wouldn't go back would be for a lack of groupon. I think there are better options at $40 pp.",

When we went in, there were a lot of tables still empty so I don't really understand why their line was so long. Since we came in at 10:30, we got to experience both breakfast and lunch dishes.  We came here because my mom desperately wanted to try their AYCE macarons. She said they were a disappointment because good macarons are supposed to melt in your mouth and their's didn't. That failure aside, many of their dessert dishes were pretty good, like the creme brulee and fruit tart. Their crepe was a bummer. The batter was tasteless and the berries were sour. The candied nuts they use are not fresh and have that refrigerated taste. All the meat dishes I tried were delicious. The prime rib was cooked just right and the pork apple dish was yummy, much better than the dry chewy crap at The Bacchanal. Their hot cherries were good. I think it's hilarious how they have sushi.  Service was average as far as buffets go. Our server came to our table so infrequently that we had to place our finished dishes on a nearby table.   Overall, I enjoyed the food and would probably go again. Lots of quality desserts and meats to choose from is always a bonus for me.",

    "text": "This definitely is at the top of my bf and I's buffet list for Vegas. We tried out Wicked Spoon, which is constantly raved about everywhere, and were VERY unimpressed.  Le Village, a bit of a walk in past the casinos and easily identifiable by its long lines, has great menus. We came here just between the brunch/dinner transition on Saturday, and found ourselves enjoying unlimited crepes (2 at a time though), bottomless mimosas, and creme brulees galore. Oh yeah, and the prime rib, and the cod (mmm), and the salmon, and the crab, and the...yeah. There's some things that aren't that great but fill yourself up on the good things and it'll be well worth your $32 (Saturday brunch/dinner price) and you'll be raving about it afterwards. I think the crepes really biased me...despite having to wait like 20 minutes in line for it while my group was already on their 3rd plates by the time I got back to the table...  Since this is one of the included buffets on the Buffet of Buffets, I'd highly recommend it even if you only plan on going to 2 buffets. Paris' Le Village is definitely worth more than half of the cost already.  I might also mention that the inside decor is great and really makes you feel like you're in a little city in France, AND the waitresses are super friendly and are all dressed just like I'd imagine they would be in France too. :)",

This is a very typical breakfast buffet but way overpriced :first once they sat us down they took a good 10min to take our drink order.... Mimosas were not included which i found funny because come on for $25-something dollar person you would think it would be included:( yet you play slot machines for .50 and drink for free) they had an omelet station with very little topics .. their bakery items were okay bear claws , blue berry muffins and chocolate muffins . their fruit selection was very sad.. cheap fruit like cantaloupe , pineapple and bananas. they had runny eggs and different kind of sausages that were okay. I will give it to them though the buffet itself is super cute really ties in with the whole french theme. I felt like i was in the beauty and the beast french corner lol. They did have a nice crepe station which im sure this why they charge so much.. i had a nice nutella banana crepe . Overall the place is really just OK. I wanted to check it out since the first time i went to vegas so this was just a vegas bucket list sort of thing. I would not come back here for that $$ just for breakfast/",

    "text": "I've officially sworn off buffets; I was leaning in that direction to begin with, but our experience at Le Village Buffet sealed the deal.  The buffets in Vegas have been heading in the same direction over the past five years - more expensive, while less quality. I've seen this happen at Rio, Wynn and now Paris. I lived in Vegas for three years and worked as a supervisor in one of the largest casinos there; as a frequent visitor to buffets, I can say this isn't simply speculation; it's what's gone down.  Le Buffet when it opened, was one of the finest in Vegas; a fantastic assortment of food stations, incredible service and desserts to die for. When we returned to this buffet in January, I was so disappointed, I felt sick all night that we'd payed about $70 for two of us to eat here.  The buffet caters primarily toward seafood now, which is great if you're a seafood lover; I am not. There were very few options that were appealing for non-seafood fans. There is a generous mountain of shrimp to mine from and there are crab legs; I do like shellfish. However, whenever the crab legs are put out, unless you're camping there, you're going to get completely raped by the pushy folks that get there before you and blast through the pile, diligently picking it clean of the good legs, leaving the spoils to everyone else. It was frustrating and annoying as hell.  The food selections I did have were okay - but definitely not worth $30 or so per person. The dessert station was a disaster; names of desserts did NOT match what was out. Obviously, the staff here doesn't care. It was a \"try your luck\" situation and patrons were left to guess what treat they were actually getting.  At one station, I couldn't separate two bowls, and I passed them toward a staff member on the other side of the counter, telling her they were stuck. She looked at me like I was an idiot and slammed the bowls on the granite counter, which made them separate. She gave me one, and started putting the other BACK INTO THE CLEAN BOWLS PILE, after I'd explained to her that I gave them to her because my hands were all over them. A woman standing next to me spoke right up and asked the staffer what she was thinking; that I'd JUST told her I was touching the bowls! The staff member frowned at the other customer and removed the bowl from the stack. Totally disgusting; makes you wonder what else ends up in the clean plates stacks there.  Table clearing was slow and finding someone to refill our soda was a joke. Total contrast to when this buffet was new and it seemed that there were several bussers for each table that were on you like vultures the minute you cleaned your plate or put an empty glass on the table. Not the case anymore, sadly, and that added to my frustration.  Standing in line for another station, the final straw broke this camel's back - a woman stood in front of me eating food off of her plate and SUCKING her fingers. Then, you guessed it, she went right on using that hand to use tongs and spoons getting more food from the buffet.  And really, that's the core problem with ANY buffet. People are disgusting. They are piggish and pushy and dirty. You can somewhat control the level of a dining experience, but you can never completely control the other customers. Case in point, The Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan - considered to be the best buffet in Vegas now by many. We ate there and the experience was okay - except for the two tables close to us with loud, drunk douchebag guests being SO loud that it disrupted everyone's experience.  So the next time you consider shelling out the better part of $100 on a Vegas buffet, remember what you're paying for - crowds of strangers pawing at the same spoons and tongs, breathing and coughing over the same food stations and a wait staff that is there making just over minimum wage that honestly won't give a rat's ass if you ever return or not. It's Vegas, and the people will come pretty much no matter what.  For the foreseeable future, I am DONE with buffets.",

The food was good, but nothing to knock your socks off and make you want to come back.   We arrived around 10am and only had a few minute wait. By the time we left, there was a considerable queue to get seated. I didn't know this at the time, but apparently each station at the buffet represents a different region of France and, accordingly, the food at the various stations relates to the region's specialties (allegedly). Regardless, it made it a tad bit convoluted to gather food for your plate (first world problem - now I feel a little ashamed for complaining about a brunch with TOO much food to chose from). For example, fried hash brown wedges were at one station, hashbrowns across the room at another, potato wedges at another. You should take a stroll around the entire buffet first to see what they are offering. The crepe station was the most popular and there was a line the entire time we were there.   The person who seated us took our drink orders (coffee, water, etc.) but couldn't take orders for mimosas. Once our waitress showed up, she took our order for mimosas. I thought they were unlimited, but she never returned to the table so not sure about that. I'm sure a few more mimosas and I would have remembered this buffet more fondly. :)  Summary: Decent enough. They had a large variety of standard breakfast food to chose from.",

If smokey air, tired servers, t-shirted eating neighbors, fatty meat, messy serving tables, cold crepes and rubbery macaroons disguised as lollipops are your thing, then go for it.    People seemed to be chowing down on the crab legs, but I wasn't going to try them.  One more thing...if you like paying the same amount to eat dinner for your 9 year old as you do for yourself, you're going to love this place!",

I love the quiche, sausage selection (great Andouille), crepes and pastry selection.  The Lyonnaise potatoes are fabulous!  Table service is fast, friendly and extremely efficient.  There is great continuity of servers at this buffet; there seems to be little to no turnover of help which speaks well to the work environment.   I have eaten here for the past 10+ years and have NEVER seen the bugs or other dirty situations others have described.    In short, this is a wonderful buffet option.  Is it gourmet?  No, but it is a nice change from typical buffet fare.",

    "text": "If you're going to get fat because of somewhere, it's pretty worth it to be here.    First off, the best thing has got to be the crepes.  They actually make it fresh and you can order a combination of any fruits or syrups they have available.  It isn't overbearingly sweet either.  The light thin crepe with the sweet and slightly tart fruit eaten along some champange during brunch is truly awesome.    Their seafood is pretty good but not the freshest.  They don't have a very good selection of sushi but they make up for in other dishes such as roasts and pastas.  There are various olive salads too if you're into that.  I thought the desert bar was much better than other buffets but I think they need a wider selection of fruits.    I also did this buffet as a part of the City-wide Buffets of Buffets deal and I waited 3 hours for brunch.  I don't think anything is worth waiting that long for so I wouldn't recommend sticking it out.  Try to gauge early on, the rate the line is moving and make a judgment accordingly.  I feel like part of the reason is that they're understaffed, while I was eating there were tables open, but no one was clearing them.    If you do get the chance to eat here though, I would highly recommend it.  Also, the inner decor is really playful.  I like the little french village theme and although it's sad that the waiters have to wear costumes, it's part of the fun.",

We arrived early enough to avoid the lines that started to form shortly there after. And even then, the lines appeared to move quickly. The staff there were very attentive to it's patrons. We had heard from another guest the night before, that the omelette station was really good.  And they were absolutely right. In addition to the omelette's, they also had really good Eggs Benedict, and Crepes. Although my wife has a special request in regards to the making of her crepe, and the breakfast chef said they all come a certain way and did not deviate from the toppings and fillings of their crepes. That didn't set well with mommy! I addressed it with the managerial staff and our concerns were address and met. Other that that, everything was pretty good. My wife kept going back for their smoked salmon. I tried a little bit of everything from a variety of smoked sausages, Eggs Benedict , potatoes with sauteed sweet onions and had no complaints at all. The two kids were happy, and like I've said before....if mommy is happy, I am happy! Overall a very good breakfast. I am a fan!",

Um .. not so much.   The food was ok, but nothing remarkable.   Crab legs were salty, the prime rib was too far well done, and the duck/lamb/chicken were on the tough side.  I did like the grilled vegetables, potatoes, and sides, but I can't fill up on those at a buffet.   I was looking forward to the desserts but they looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while.   Maybe I went on an off night and breakfast is a better deal, but I probably won't be back.  Sure, the Bellagio buffet is twice as much, but I'd much rather eat there for dinner instead.",

Margarine and preserves were everywhere except no butter :(  Went after 10AM and and was there for the lunch changeover.  Of course, there was just no room to eat any of it but we got to take a tour of the lunch fare.  Will definitely go back!

There was plenty.  Quality: now that's another issue.  Everything I ate was room temperature. Pasta. Room temperature. Meat. Room temperature. Soup. Room temperature.  There was no flavor in the food. Very disappointing.  Now, even though the food was terrible, it was not the worst part! The service was horrid.  Never in my life I thought to be treated this way. It started innocently by asking for a bowl for my soup.  I rudely heard \"ask your server\". I don't want to ask my server. I am asking you.  Then, I went to get some not-prime rib. After slicing my piece, the not-attendant literally threw the meat into my plate. \"Are you serious\" I thought.   But, we were just getting started.  We have been in the restaurant for about 30 minutes, coming and going, trying to find something decent to eat. Since my utensils got dirty, I asked the server for some new ones. Nothing. I asked again. Nothing. I asked another person. Nothing. One more time. Nothing. Finally, I got up to get my own silverware. Than I hear \"I need to see your receipt\". I thought he was talking to someone else. Nope, he was directing his question to me. I explained I have been here for a while and \"don't you remember my handsome face\". \"No\" he replied. Anyway, I ignored him, got my fork and went back to suffer from the food on my plate.  Please, don't make the mistake my friends and I made.  DO NOT COME HERE. Don't even think about coming here.  Unless of course, you want to laugh at terrible food and bad service.",

I didn't like it as much, but other people (including my wife) seemed to like them a lot.   Other than the crepes most of the dishes were not as French as I expected.  The obligatory chunks o' meat (turkey, ham, prime rib) were there.  Ordinary sides.  They had some dolmas (which were unique).  And their mac and cheese was really good (because it appeared to be made with good pasta and cheeses, not the usual orange sludge one often finds).  Again, the food was good.

    "text": "Sooooo I feel like I shouldn't review this place because someone who knows me as a responsible adult will be shocked by my sin city behavior. The buffet at Paris is my favorite in all of Vegas. On Sundays, they do a champagne brunch which brings out the hoarder in me. The booze and banana hoarder.   Every time I've eaten here, I've managed to convince our server to leave the whole champagne bottle on our table. And every single time I've filled a giant (20oz) cup with OJ and champagne just before leaving. Needless to say, I have quite a lot of \"forgotten\" time at Paris.   The food is delicious, the crepes station is so fun (if you can stand the line... There is always a line) and anything made with potatoes is drool-worthy. The ham at the carving station always makes me think I should bring a ziplock bag to sneak some home for a late-night snack.   So, amid all this crazy awesome and decadent food, why do I hoard bananas? Because they serve fruit here! I've encountered a lot of buffets that only have fancified food, and sometimes you just want a freaking banana. Or a banana phone (see pics)",

We had a groupon, which came with a bottle of wine for 2 people - so it was a great deal!   Love that they have a station for the different regional cuisines of France, in addition to the cold seafood station and amazing desserts in the middle. Seriously, save room. My friends all said this was the best desserts we had in vegas (the Wynn was up there too!) with macaroon cake pops, little tartlets, cakes, pies...you name it.  But on to the real food - main dishes! First, the crab legs weren't that great, so skip those and save room for everything else. The prime rib was amazing, and so was the pork with the apple cider reduction and baked apples that came in a single-serve skillet. Adorable and so flavorful! The salmon was also very good, as well as the fall vegetable hash with carrots, squash, onions, and a few other things I can't remember. It was great though. If i wasn't allergic to gluten I would've tried the make your own crepes station, which looked divine. I did however try the caramelized bananas by themseves...WOW they were good! They also have a mediterranean station with lots of crudites and sauces that are great for pairing with a lot of the other dishes you can get around the buffet.   Don't fill up on bread - there's so many other good things to try!!",

Not sure if i went in an odd time or off day but the desserts had zero labels! The only thing that tasted good were creme brulee and flan... Pretty sad buffet! Service was decent but lacking compared to nearby hotels. To sum it up, it is like a nicer hometown buffet.",

If there's a line consider just buying a crepe and a pastry in the nearby shops.   Pros - Crepe station all day - Better quality food than most buffets  - Not crowded once you get in   Cons - HORRIBLE lines, even when there are plenty of tables inside - They change breakfast food out at 11, and stop making it well before then. You should arrive by 9-9:30 so that you can get through the awful line, be seated, and get food before they run out and change out breakfast food before 11.  - Service not great, no instruction, slow to clear plates.  - Like must buffets, you'll be eating with some seriously gross people gorging themselves with food.",

But since you are already in the restaurant you can take advantage of the brunch options! This way you get both the breakfast menu and brunch menu at the breakfast price. Several highlights: light and fluffy eggs with cheddar cheese, flavorful ham, delectable crepes, a salad bar, turkey, grilled vegetables, fruit, lots of pastries and much more!

We've been go to Vegas for 20+ years but never to the Paris hotel.  A few things really stood out: - Nice atmosphere  (not your regular florescent buffet lighting). - Every buffet has prime rib BUT this was the best I've had in Vegas. It was perfectly seasoned with salt & spices and so, so, TENDER.    - Great selection of food, organized around french regions. - The Seafood bar is not as large as the Rio but the clams & mussels were superb.  - Even the ice cream machine is A+ with Vanilla Custard (not just plain vanilla soft serve). To my surprise - this was 4-5 star food served in at a buffet.  Woohoo. **note**  If you do the Buffet Pass Paris - A+ Rio - B+ (great selection whether regular or seafood) Cesar's - closed for remodeling (Major bummer!!) Imperial Palace - D Flamingo - C Bally's - Haven't tried",

Little things like prime rib cooked longer than the roast beef, bland soup, generic creme brule, noisy dish carts going by your table all the time, etc.  Overall, it wasn't horrible but we're in vegas and everything is supposed to be over the top--not here just your plain Royal Fork-type restaurant.  Oh yea, I loved the 30 minute wait to get seated and when finally got seated looked around and saw half the tables empty and staff just standing around.  ...when we left half the tables still empty and longer line.",

This is one the is on the list of favorites, we've never been to this buffet on the weekend, but during the week, following Labor Day weekend, there was a minimal line. The lamb and the duck were both very tasty, not gamey at all and cooked correctly. We were able to grab the groupon which was an excellent deal as well, but would eat here again without the groupon.",

A flowy top that covers your stomach - $30.00  Cab ride from the Monte Carlo - $7.00 (tip included)  Dinner - $24.50  Eating until you think you might actually die... priceless.  This was the first time I had eaten at the Paris buffet for dinner and I was quite pleased. We went later in the evening (around 8ish). Being a lover of buffets, I usually go to the Bellagio for dinner. Or else I wanted to try the Wynn. But my friend convinced us by telling us that they have fondue (melted cheese, my favorite!). But when we got there.... no fondue. We asked the waitress and it seems that they stopped a while back. So for those of you expecting fondue, THEY HAVE STOPPED THE FLOWING OF THE CHEESE.   But otherwise, it was a pretty good deal. It was cheaper than other buffets and luckily there was no line. One thing I enjoyed was the fact that they had dungeness crab as well as king crab. I enjoy dungeness so much more. The grilled vegetables section was GREAT. The asparagus was the size of a curling iron! They also had some great seafood. The sushi (apparently a French food) was mediocre.   Also, they have all these small rooms to emulate the ambiance of a quaint French village. But I kept getting lost on my way back from the buffet! Be sure to leave a trail of crumbs when you get up to get food.",

    "text": "This is one of my top 5 favorite buffets.  I don't remember the bad but I definitely remember the good, so I'll mention those.  I came here for breakfast and there was a 30-40 minute wait on a Tuesday. After we were seated, the waitress quickly brought us both orange juice and a pot of hot coffee. The omelet bar was my favorite. The chef spent a good amount of time making each omelete. He would first cook the stuff in the omelete: spinach, mushrooms, bacon, etc. then he would mix in the egg to cook it, finally he would ask if you want cheese and fold the cheese in last. There was salsa at the end of the bar. This was one of my favorite items for breakfast. The biscuit and gravy was good. I would avoid the scrambled eggs, they were a bit watery when we had them. Try to get the bacon on the top of the try, the bottom pieces tend to be more drenched in oil/grease. The fruits are always good. The crepes were okay, I asked the chef to make mine a little thinner. They also give you a big scoop of cream. Since the fruits they use are quite sour, it helps cut the sourness :]   I also came here another day for lunch since a friend wanted to come here. Surprisingly I wasn't disappointed. After having the pastas at PH's Spice Market, I was scared to try the pasta here, but they were really yummy and I'm glad I did. Definitely try all the pastas, I liked the pest tortellini, brie mac n cheese, and mushroom ravioli. The roast beef was really good, if you like medium rare you have to ask for it or else they automatically give you a medium well piece. If you like medium well and they only have rare pieces, ask the chef to put it on the grill to make it medium well. The grilled asparagus goes really well with the au jus and roast beef. Remember to bring pour some in a small bowl cause pouring it directly makes the other items on your plate absorb it. The sushi looked funky so I avoided those, but around the corner in the Asian-ish station was a steamed cod stuffed with a garlicy goodness. They have cold crab legs here, which I wasn't too fond of. If you want crab legs, go to Spice market. I also had the duck, it was okay, something to try. Okay, time for desserts! Everyone raves about the creme brulee, but not the best here. It was goood, but the sugar did not crack. They make so many of these, they just put them in the fridge after they burn the sugar so the sugar doesn't crack when your spoon smacks it. They still taste good but not OMG FRESH YUMMY good. Other good stuff: chocolate mousse tarte, croissant w/ chocolate, cheesecake w/ strawberry and bread pudding.   Man this was a long review. So just come here for breakfast and try the pastas and roast beef if you come here for lunch/dinner. Get the buffet of buffet pass and try this place for breakfast. If you want coffee to-go, just ask your waitress for a paper cup... and remember to tip them for being so nice :]",

Grilled veggies, meaterie, pasta station, crab legs (pre-cracked), shrimp (not peeled), small sushi station, dessert (of course, it's paris!), crepe station, omelette station, breakfast food (waffles, eggs benedict), salad.  The salad station was pretty pathetic, there were hardly any toppings and all high fat dressings. No croutons either. The grilled veggies were delicious, though. The crepe station line is uber long, big downer. The good thing is that it IS one of the cheaper buffets, I guess I feel like you get what you pay for. Or if you're hungover from a long night of Vegas-style partying, a lil grease could only make you feel better.  Yummilicious Factor= B-",

We were going there strictly because it was Sunday and Mother's Day so they have champagne brunch for $30. We waited about 30 minutes in line. The place is huge, but everything is pretty spread out. You think there's more than there really is.   We get our first round of food. We decided to hit up breakfast yummies first. There was an omelet station and basically all the breakfast fixings. It was decent. We arrive back at our table and there's OJ waiting for us so we can make mimosas with the champagne we were going to ask for. When we finally flagged down our server, she actually stared at us and asked us if we were 21. She almost didn't believe us. Come on, we are in Vegas.   Our next plate was meats. They have a wide selection of meats. The flavors were there, but everything was dry. The mashed potatoes looked really good, but it's like they poured a whole thing of salt in there. Someone must have read the recipe wrong. Instead of a pitch, they threw in hand fulls. I've never wasted so much food at a buffet before. There was a seafood section with crab legs and shrimp. I walked by and the crab legs they had there looked pathetic compared to the ones at Rio's seafood buffet. I didn't even bother.  The dessert selection was okay at best. They have the typical desserts. Their Creme Brulee wasn't even that good... and it's suppose to be a French inspired buffet... HA!!! Their only good quality is that there was a crepe station. The line was enormous, but its worth the wait.   Honestly, there are plenty of other great Sunday Brunch with all you can drink champagne in Vegas. Don't go here. Pick Belagio for a little more money.",

Would I go for the higher weekend prices for breakfast? probably not. The food was delicious, there was a large selection but really I think I expected more. I feel like what I got was pretty standard breakfast options (pastries, eggs made lots of ways, pancakes, french toast, bagels, yogurts, fruit, typical breakfast meats). Don't get me wrong, that's what I wanted and what I and my party ate and it was good. I guess I just figured for all the hype, there would be more \"oooh i've never seen/had that!\" and \"oooh i've never had that for breakfast!\" options. Nonetheless, would go again for the same price (i guess weekedays in the morning) but not for weekend inflation.",

The ambiance was fun, with the staff dressed up and feeling like I really was dining at a cute little place in France. The foods were delicious and grouped according to different regions of France. There was some pretty standard stuff, but also various cheese, made-to-order crepes, duck, dumplings, special desserts and just other foods oozing with deliciousness. The macaroons were absolutely fabulous!  Definitely recommend coming here. It's a nice treat away from standard buffets (like Harrah's.)",

So we kept walking...well one morning waking up hungover & starving we decided to head for the closest buffet in hopes that it wouldn't be too long of a wait, after all it was a Thursday morning!! We get there and it was the shortest we had seen, YES, SCORE! ...NOT!!! We get in line & pay rather quickly but after you pay you wait....& wait..... & wait....& wait some more!!! They are smart, they make you pay before you realize how long you really have to wait!! So we finally get almost to the front, the hostess takes the party of 2 that's ahead of us to a table but NEVER RETURNS!!!!!! We stood there about 15 minutes in the front of the line!!  While we stood there wondering if she would ever return we saw a few waitresses pass by, a manager pass twice, another worker come answer the phone & argue with a customer on the phone...not one of those people said \"is anyone helping you?\" Or \"sorry about the wait\" or \"someone will be right with you\"! Really?! What kind of manager walks by with no care of how his guests are being taken care of! At one point I said to my husband lets just go seat ourselves, Who would notice??? NO ONE!!!! Finally a different hostess comes from behind us in the line to start her shift, the other hostess had left on break or something with no one covering her!!! There were about 20 empty tables, SOMEONE could've sat us!! ......anyways as you can tell I was furious with this \"service\" (especially after spending 22.99 a person) !!!   Moving on to the food... I thought please Paris redeem yourself with this food!! Nope...terrible! It's like they are trying too hard to be fancy...the food Is roasted potatoes, garlic Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, Mac & cheese, sausages, pork & a few other random things. It was all gross! The best thing Is the ice cream, if you do decide that you just have to go here, get the ice cream.  In addition I've been to plenty of buffets in Vegas this is by far THE WORST!!",

    "text": "Note to self: breakfast buffet ($15.99) starts at 7am and runs till 11am. It's not until 11am to 3:30pm on Saturdays and Sundays that champagne brunch ($24.99) is served. Needless to say, Jon A. and I got there a little earlier than we should have since we were talking up how much champagne we'd guzzle while we were there.  Misunderstood time aside, the breakfast buffet was actually pretty good! There was no wait at 8:00 AM on a Saturday, and we helped ourselves out to the bagels with lox (assemble yourself), goat cheese, made-to-order crepes, and all kinds of potato- and egg-derived breakfast foods, some of which happened to have a French-American twist. Multiple varieties of turkey sausage are available, too, which was nice since I didn't want to feel gross from eating too much pork sausage. The sliced ham was a pleasant surprise, and the corned beef hash was also tasty. The pastry selection impressed me, but I opted to skip them for more protein. The cones available for soft serve (vanilla or chocolate) are sugar cones with different combinations of sprinkles, chocolate shell, and other fancy-looking edible decorations.  The service was on the good side of average: our waitress was friendly and seemed to sincerely want to please, but it did take a couple tries to get refills on our orange juice. All of the waitstaff are wearing uniforms in what I suppose is French dress as interpreted by Americans.  Fake sky above you, and food stations scattered around: both contributed to the informal, casual atmosphere. We didn't feel rushed, and we weren't even worried that we were too early for the champagne brunch!  The verdict: Le Village is a decent place to have a chill breakfast, and it won't break the bank. Bring your appetite with you!",

    "text": "This was a very popular spot the morning we chose to eat breakfast here.  So popular, in fact, that the CEO of Harrah's Entertainment decided to eat here.  Now, we didn't see him, but since we were the only people eating in a particular private room, the staff moved us to a table in the main area of the restaurant, and we were comped for both of our meals!    Le Village Buffet is very cute and looks just like a Parisian street or French village street.  It is very Disney (reminded me of \"Beauty and the Beast\") but nonetheless, I liked the ambiance.  There were many food stations and options.  There were even healthier options, like a melange of fruit, oatmeal, cottage cheese, smoked salmon, etc.  My favorite foods were the savory bread puddings (with spinach, cheese, and sausage) and the turkey sausage with sweet potatoes (sounds weird, but trust me, it was good).    I probably would have only given the restaurant four stars if it weren't for the comp, but I would definitely recommend it for breakfast.  If you have a breakfast buffet in Las Vegas, come to the Paris.",

    "text": "I still remember this buffet from the last time I was in Vegas, 5 years ago. This visit, we made sure to fully enjoy the buffet. I took a tip from a fellow yelper. We went in at 10am, paying only for the low breakfast price, and stayed for lunch which started at 11am. I was so excited when it got close to 11am, what would happen? Would the food magically go from breakfast to lunch? I ate lightly for breakfast, saving my appetite for a hearty lunch. When 11am arrived, many of the main entree trays started being switched out. Bread trays were taken out and replaced with sushi. Pancakes were changed to herb roasted chicken. Ham was switched to Prime Rib. OMG! Was I dreaming? I had to pinch myself.  They will ask you your drink choice when you pay to get in. Order coffee! The coffee is truly amazing! It has so much character, robust but not too dark. They give you a whole carafe! Wish I could've taken that home with me. The corned beef hash during breakfast is amazing! They kept running out of this. The herb roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and wide selection of vegetables really hit the spot. After all these buffets you need some vegetables to wash down the gluttony. The desserts are incredible - creme brulee (of course), flan, fresh made dessert crepes, and chocolate croissants. Skip the sushi. I've had better sushi from Safeway and sushi doesn't belong in a French buffet.  2 hours of unlimited eating for $13.95/person. So worth it!

Previous Review (11/30/2007): Remember how we always get confused about which buffet we should go to while in Vegas so that we don't regret about missing out the best food during our short stay ???  Well, let me try to make it a bit easier for you all... The Best Buffet in Las Vegas is in Paris - Le Village Buffet. I agree that if you are craving for steak or Chinese, definitely this is not the location. However, if you are just craving for delicious good quality food... this is the place!!!      If I don't go to this one, I go to the Rio Buffet for a change sometimes. But Paris is always my 1st preference!!!",

I wasnt that excited to see their selections.   the taste of their food was just okay the last time i went.   not much to say about this place - it's really just okay.. fine a little better than just okay. And trust me, it's still better than a lot of other places. but i guess if The wynn and bellagio's is too much for your wallet, then Paris is a good deal.",

The cold crab legs were bursting with flavor.  The crawfish in the bouillabaisse were briliant!   Duck a l'orange wasn't bad.  Gnocchi a la Kouros and cassolet with pork and beef  were enjoyable - - but other sides and pastas were kind of on the plain side.  Cheeses on the cheese tray were a let-down, with run-of-the mill cheddar, muenster, and smoked gouda.    Main complaint though:  it is so dark in the eating area that your food looks uniformly grey and muddy once you get it to your table.  The tables need candles - - or any kind of localized lighting, really badly.",

The other food was alright but I didn't pay much attention, although I did notice their crab is a little too salty for our likings.

It's a buffet, so I don't expect all the food to be great, but most of it was good quality. Service was great & punctual at clearing our dishes & filling our drinks.  We ended up sitting \"inside\" which felt like you're in someone's cute, cozy country home with less people noise going around. The ambiance is great since it doesn't feel like you're at a buffet, the outside area feels a s if you're in a European village even though technically it's still indoors.",

I must give props to our waiter as he did a fabulous job of keeping our flutes full.  (At most of these buffets the waiters check back very infrequently).  Helpful Hints ... *Have your drink order ready when you approach the counter to pay for your meal.  This is the only place that does it this way, so just be prepared for that question.   *Ask if you can be seated in one of the little alcoves.  The noise level is a lot lower and there aren't massive amounts of people weaving around your table staring at your food.   *Wait in line for the Crepe.  They are delicious - especially as a dessert stuffed with your favorite fruit.    *If you don't see an item on the buffet that was listed on the menu, let someone know and they will track it down for you.  This goes for the meat preparation as well.  *Don't skip the mashed potatoes.  They're delicious!       One star gets deducted for the crab legs.  Having been spoiled by a few of the other buffets, I was not a fan of having to crack my on crab legs. But there were plenty of other items on the buffet that made up for this slight inconvenience.",

For dinner and $25 there could have been more selection and the food could have been better. The only thing I really liked was the grilled lamb, but the other meat seemed dry, such as the prime rib and the leg of lamb. Also, they have a crepe section, but don't be fooled. They have only a few things you can put on. That day they only had chocolate, blueberry, pear and pickled cherries. They didn't even have bananas or anything like that. Their fruit selection could have been better by a lot, as they only really offered melon. The crab legs were only okay, but not great.  I have to say though that the deserts was good, except, i had really wished there was something better than soft serve as a cold dessert.   For the price, there could have been more selection and better food. For that price or cheaper, i would try RIO carnival or Red Rock. If you are willing to pay more, go to Wynn, their crepe section is by far better, and offer lobster and crab.",

Hurrying, while trying to eat buffet style is disgusting and makes your stomach feel like it is going to pop.    Buffet food, no matter how tasty it is, is still buffet food.  The food at Le Village may have been good, but in piling a random assortment of foods on my plate everything got mixed up--salmon leek sauce mixed with crab juices mixed with creamed spinach mixed with pork=gross.  I ended up eating mostly crab with melted butter.    Also, I was not that impressed with the desert selection.  I missed out on the crepes (the line was long and I was in a hurry to get to a show), but the cherry tart I had was boring and tasted very doughy.    The best part, besides the crab legs, was the atmosphere and our waiter.  The french village theme was cute and our waiter was amazingly quick with clearing plates, bringing drinks, and checking in with us.",

    "text": "Here for the 2nd time at Paris Casino & not disappointed!  Great value at $21.99 for breakfast/lunch!    4 months ago, a Yelper wrote a negative review stating  \"...there was no selection of 'Asian-Style' food..no sweet & sour, no tempura anything...\".   Well, dummie--  no Asian food because this is a FRENCH Buffet, representing 8 or 9 regions of FRANCE (Brittanny, Burgundy, Provence, Savoie, etc.).   Nothing but \"French food\" (okay some American style too).  Atmosphere a little dark. Wait staff have to wear some silly French costume,  Room is set up like some Fake-o French plaza--Reminds me of Disneyland exhibits.  I think this is the best buffet for the money (I only have experienced it in the AM/Noon time frame).  We arrived about 10:40, line not too bad.  Our friendly server was A++.  Xcellent job of keeping our coffee cups full, as well as bringing water, juice, etc.   Breakfast foods galore-- bacon, sausage, egg white frittata, spinach omelet, croissants, apple sweet rolls, waffles, and marvelous CREPES--You must have them!  As well as Lox and bagels, Lyonnaise potatoes (yum!!) and other goodies.      Arrive at 10:30 or so, as you get the best of both worlds--they end breakfast around 11am-ish & start to put out lunch items:  Beef Burgundy, Chicken Chausser, Ceasar salad, etc.  Desserts were wonderful:  flan, creme brulee, cakes,cheesecake, tarts, tortes, and other 'nummie' things.  Lots of fruit and salads.  Most other buffets have been huge disappointments to us, but not this one, great food and value for the money at the breakfast price!",

There was a very diverse selection of foods to choose from, which were all very tasty and fresh.  There was prime rib, roast beef, mussels, and clams just to name a few special foods. For dessert I highly recommend the crepe station and the cream Brule. If you aren't sure about dining here, they will let you look around before you pay for a ticket. The mimosas were good, but because it's kind of busy you may have to wait a while if you order a second one. We felt the price for the assortment of food was very reasonable.",

The only issue I had with this place was it was almost impossible to get a water refill. My date had to literally leave and find someone for me because my water glass had been empty for quite a while and even after he found someone it still took a while to get more water.

This was the last stop for my buffet of buffets pass.   The service here is very slow. When we asked for a server, they would tell us that they would get our server, but our server never came.. so my friend ended up waiting a while to get his refill of drinks.   They had iced opened crab legs, mussels, clams, cocktail shrimp at the seafood section.  I regret eating ice cold clams first thing in the morning because it made my tummy not feel very good.   The meat selection here is pretty good, asides from the prime rib, turkey, and ham they also have lamb chops, and tri tip.  The tri tip steak was surprisingly tender!   The eggs benedict here are really good!! I just wish they came out  more often because they disappeared pretty fast.  They also had an omelette station & crepe station here.  The crepes were really good, and even though the line looked really long, the guy made the crepes pretty fast.   They did not have alot of selection at this buffet, the strawberries were kind of sour.   They did not have watermelon either.   The only dessert I liked was the creme brulee, caramel custard, and the vanilla custard/ice cream thing.  The rest of the desserts looked unappetizing.  I hate the lighting in this buffet, it is so dark and makes the restaurant look outdated.   I would come here again for brunch because of the eggs benedict, crepes, and omelette station, other than that there is nothing really worth coming for.  I would definitely not pay the $30 or however much it costs for dinner.",

I'm sorry to say we made a mistake. The food was horrible.   The cashier was not friendly. Usually, I walk away when people are being weird, but we really wanted to do a buffet and we were hungry. We waited in line for about 10 minutes before we were seated.   Our server was really nice. We knew it was busy, so we asked her to bring double the drinks. I had 2 cups of water, boyfriend had 2 cups of coke. That way we eliminate the need to wait for her when we get thirsty.   I always walk around first so I can see what the options are. Everything smelled and looked good. I could hardly wait. I grabbed some sushi rolls, I got a savory mushroom crepe, pasta, and shrimp cocktail. The sushi roll was chewy, the crepe wasn't cooked long enough, the pasta was dry, and my shrimp cocktail was soggy, like soggy bread soggy. I asked my boyfriend to bring me a cut of prime rib since he was going. It was dry.   At this point, I'm not happy, but I saw the dessert and it looked delicious. I grabbed macaroons, creme burlee, and flan. The macaroons were way too sweet. They tasted like when you roll cotton candy into a tiny ball with your fingers, you know what I'm talking about. The flan was flavorless. The only thing I liked was the creme burlee, but it was very eggy.   This is the worst buffet I have been to in Las Vegas. I've been to the one in Luxor, MGM, Wynn, and Harrahs. At least at those other buffets, you can find something that is really good. I couldn't believe that everything was bad here. I'm still searching for a really good buffet in Vegas.",

I will tell u it was intimidating because I was sooooo hungry-- but I opted to take my chances as opposed to trying to find something else. It literally only took about ten minutes to filter all those people through! :)   The crepe station was TO DIE FOR!  I had a sweet one AND a savory one (couldn't resist!)  The caprese one included pesto, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, balsamic dressing. MMMMMMMM!!!  I also tried the monkey. It was kind of a bananas fosters meets Nutella. Yum and yum. Had hazelnuts on top as well as whipped cream.  I cannot emphasize this enough. These were made fresh right in front of u, and worth the wait. (Probably the main attraction during breakfast) only took a few minutes with several people in line... I believe there were two cooks and four griddles. So don't be too intimidated by the line!  They had ur standard fresh made omelette station, which I always appreciate. And the creme brulee was great!  Also, the strawberries had the best flavor I have had in a while.  TOP NOTCH buffet and I think it was only about $22 for breakfast. I would say that's worth EVERY PENNY!  Or, u could go all out gluttony style and do the buffet of buffets like I did. $60 for 24 hours of food at selected buffets!   PARIS WAS BY FAR MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE I TRIED... (Others were planet Hollywood :-/ and rio which was also great, but I just can't get over how fabulous Paris was.",

I sampled some lamb & Prime rib that were very good,  Some German like sausages with Kraut, smoked salmon with an assortment of cheeses, some salads and an assortment of other things.  Everything I tried was a party for my palate.    Then after my meal I sampled the caramel apple crepe and the strawberry, blueberry, raspberry crepe that were to die for.   We had a large group and they made us pay 17% gratuity that I thought for a buffet like this was a bit much. Especially when the service is not quite a good as the last time I ate at a Golden coral.... Lol.

I did try a macaron here as well and it was pretty terrible. Bacchanal's are better, which is odd seeing as how you would think the Paris ones would be the best.

We stowed our bags at Planet Hollywood and made our way to Paris, where we were able to pay the $24.99 \"breakfast\" price due to our pre-10 am arrival. Our wait in line was probably around 10 minutes, more than enough time for us to deduce that the additional ~$13 fee for \"All You Can Drink\" (beer, wine, Champagne, mimosas, Bloody Marys) would be money well-spent. And well-spent it was. Our server Deborah was just the sweetest gal, and she kept those mimosa glasses topped off.  Overall, we were pretty impressed with the food at Le Village. Of all the things I sampled, the only weak spot was the Eggs Benedict. The scrambled egg dishes, however, were great as were the hashbrowns. The bacon was paper-thin but tasty! I loved the pretzel rolls, and my friend raved about the apple-filled pastry she got. She would have loved to have tried a savory crepe, but unfortunately the line for that station was always pretty long.  It turned out that we had great timing for our visit as around 10:30-11:00 the breakfast foods began to be transitioned over to lunch items - caprese salad, pastas, mashed potatoes and dolmas were all excellent. There was also a lunchtime selection of seafood, carved roast, and various Asian selections that I didn't really explore but might on a future visit! And a future visit there will be...Le Village is a great buffet, especially for the price.",

    "text": "For buffets in Vegas, Le Village could use a little improvement, but offers enough for me to want to go back.  The food itself wasn't too crazy.  Le Village doesn't really go the \"international\" route.  All the items have more of a European touch to it or some sort of preparation that seems more \"French.\" Marinated artichoke hearts, French onion soup, caprese, and stuffed soles are few of the standout for me.  There's a carving station serving prime rib and roast beef.  The prime rib was pure awesomeness with the middle still pink and I went crazy on the delicious au jus.  it's probably the best item in the whole buffet.  There's grilled chicken and a apple grilled pork chop that may be a little dry.  There's also Bourguignonne sauce for your meat, which is a mushroom based sauce.  Since I went for the brunch, a significant part of it was dedicated to breakfast items: eggs, bacon, sausages, pancakes, and French toast.  Fairly typical.  The tiny thick Belgian waffles though, are great.  I usually don't expect buffets to do waffles well, but it's fluffy on the inside and they have hot maple syrup ready.  There's a crepe station, but... skip it, unless you want to get a sugar overload?  The fillings are the typical sweetened fruit fillings that is super sweet.  But right next to the crepe station though are these pecan sticky buns.  If you're a fan of sweet, sticky, nutty goodness, then that's for you!  I barely touched the seafood section since we were seated near there and when I saw them refill the area, it made me to not want it since it's all out of boxes in plastic bags.  At least do a better job of presenting/preparing it :P  Dessert selections could use a little help but I do like how they serve chocolate dipped ice cream cones for the soft serve machines.  There's macaroons but the filling is just jam, which is a little disappointing.  The weekend brunch price for around $30 is the Champagne brunch, which is great if you like bubbly but price is horrible if you want just want a meal.  Take advantage of the unlimited champagne!  The decor is pretty unique for a buffet since they try to make you feel like you are eating at the courtyard of a village.  However, it's dimly lit in some areas so it feels a little... old.  Service... is a little inconsistent.  Our first waitress was slow and looked like she couldn't wait to get out of there.  We eventually flagged down another waitress and she was great, and helped us throughout the meal.  All in all, Le Village isn't bad and $30 for unlimited champagne brunch is a fair price for Vegas buffets.  If they paid a little more attention to detail, then it would be a much more enjoyable meal.  Little things like soup could've been hotter, ice cream rather than soft serve, or even having a staff that actually cares about cleanliness.  Saw a cook refilling the soup and the water boiler overflowed after the pot was dropped it and she didn't bother wiping the station, even if it is only water.",

Station was dirty and was shocked to see a large plastic cup with TIPS written on it sitting on the counter.   Went to get a roll and was honestly horrified at the broken and chipped 'sneeze guard' (not sure of the official name) that was being held together with MASKING TAPE! Yes...MASKING TAPE! What? No manager in his or her right mind would allow this if they were paying attention to it. Side Note: Bread was stale.  Food counters were filthy and looked like they hadn't seen a good scrub down or even wipe down in days.  Desserts - total disappointment.  What a disappointment you are to me my dear Paris.  I will not be back.",

If we would have been paying full price ($40 each), I might not have loved it as much.  The highlights for us was the seafood: crab legs (split already for you!), steamer clams, a seafood stew, and shrimp.    We also enjoyed the cheeses, crepes, pasta, and the different meats.  We left with a nice buzz and full tummies.    Our waitress Isela, needs a shout out.  She was really nice and kept the drinks coming and plates cleared quickly.  If this comes up on groupon or any discount site again - I'd definitely go for it!",

    "text": "We decided come to come to this buffet during our trip to Vegas simply because we couldn't make up our minds as to where to go and we just happened to be at Paris that day. The line looked long when we arrived, but it didn't take long to get to the front. Each person was almost $30 if I remember correctly, $24.99 plus tax came out to almost $30 on a weekend lunch. We were seated in an appropriate manner that didn't take too long, thank goodness. We got tables for 6 in an almost room like area where it was slightly closed off, which made it a little quieter.  FOOD: I don't remember anything that stood out, had the usual meat slices and mashed potatoes and vegetables. I also had the shrimp cocktail which were relatively fresh with a good crunch, the cocktail sauce itself tasted really weird almost like medicine. I was really grossed out by it, definitely didn't get seconds on that. They were all pretty meh, I only ended up having two plates of food. For dessert we had the creme brulee that was a little too soggy and didn't have that good crunch on top. But they had this really cool crepe station that makes crepes to order, I ordered a sweet crepe, Le Siege that consisted of whipped cream, nutella, and bananas. It was actually really good, I liked the outside batter when its fresh off the cooker thing but it gets really soggy if you don't eat it quick enough. I loved it because they put so much nutella in it! Mmmm!  SERVICE: Quick to clean the dishes and often offered to refill our drinks for us. They were also very friendly and happy to assist us when we had questions as to where something was.",

    "text": "One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. Last time I came was probably a good 5-6 years ago, but I remember the wait gets really really long if you don't get there super early. Hence, my group rushed to get there by 530 to beat the wait.   There was probably 20-30 people ahead of us for dinner. The line moved quite quickly as they were still trying to seat people when we arrived. The ambiance definitely stands out compared to any other buffet I've been to. They have a little building in the middle just for the dozens of desserts that they offer.   The prime rib here is pretty good although this time around, a lot of the meat was medium rare. They have a crepe station that serves both savory and sweet. The sweet crepe is very filling so be sure to save that till the very end.   This buffet has a lot of variety and it's hard not to find something that you would like.   Key: When I was leaving around 700-730, there was a line with at least 75 people in it. The wait is usually up to 90 minutes around then.",

Our drinks were empty the majority of the time, and our plates were stacked on our little table.

If I were to compare this with any other buffet that I've been to then I'll say that this buffet isn't worse nor is it better than those buffets I've attended.  They do have a very reasonable amount of dinner items, and I tried to taste as many things as my stomach would allow me. Other than their mashed potatoes and their seafood items nothing really stood out and inspired me to make an urgent return. Even their dessert was nothing special to me. They had a few items that were satisfying but nothing that made me want to come .back again.  I don't think this is a bad buffet and I'm pretty sure that you will be able to find something you enjoy eating here. I mean its a buffet.  Hey this isn't the best buffet I've been to but I do believe that it can get the job done in filling you up.  I haven't decided if I'll ever come back to this buffet because there are so many buffets in Vegas. I guess if I'm on limited time and don't have the time to go to any other buffet then I would come to this one. Other than that I have to try the other buffets out in Vegas before making the decision to come back.  Happy eating people!",

Cost is pretty cheap and the environment looks cool but after finishing my food it's pretty cheap looking as well.   The variety is only about 5 different stations for food.  Staff seem like they don't care or want to smile.  Seating is awkward...they seated us in a separate room. No music in a small space with other people = uncomfortable.  I feel like I have to whisper.  Food was good not great.   I would honestly say this place is a pass unless you are looking for novelty and price point.",

    "text": "\"That might be the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.\" - Scott Conant, Chopped.  I'm so disappointed in this place.  Bad food, bad service, high prices.  How can it get worse?  I figured with all the good things I heard about their brunch, if I chose my items carefully, I could turn this 3.5 star rated place into a 4 star experience -- so wrong.  When over-done prime rib and dry turkey are what \"save\" a place, that speaks to how bad everything else was.  To make matters worse, very poor, rude service at the cashier --  felt like a stereotypical Chinese restaurant, killing the Paris escapism. And I'm Chinese!  $25 for my 13 year old daughter who ate half a crepe?    Here's a rundown of the foods sampled:  - prime rib - unevenly cooked, but mostly grey over done.  - turkey - bone dry, the gravy was solidified and chunky so I didn't use it.  - mussels/clams - flavorless  - pastas - bland, dry, room temp  - fruits - not sweet, watery, flavorless  - bread - stale  - pate - big clunky pieces, no finesse   - cheeses - ditto  - orange juice - like tang  I honestly can't understand why anyone would like this place.  Are they so excited to be in Vegas they overlook quality?  First time at a buffet?  Because they have a crepe station?  This place makes Hometown Buffet feel special.  I REALLY hate wasting food and would always make an effort to finish something, even if I don't care for it.  But sadly on this day, we wasted quite a bit of food.  I feel so violated.  My tip.... Go to somewhere like Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chao for lunch, if you want a high quality buffet.  You'll spend less than dinner prices, and if you think Village Buffet is good, you'll think you're in heaven.",

We asked a worker when the last call was and was told that it was 10:45pm. We figured it was enough time to stuff our faces and decided to wait it out. We were seated about half an hour later.  My favorites were the mashed potatoes, crab legs, and raspberry cheesecakes. Everything else was just okay...I was excited to eat the clams and mussels but they were kind of fishy. It was probably because we came at the very end of the day though.  Our server was Tam and he was amazing!!! He always checked up on us and the tables around us. What a great guy. We ordered the all you can drink special from him. My boyfriend always got the blue moon and I got the house red wine. Tam was very quick with our drink refills! We never had to wait with an empty glass (which was great because time was of the essence!). He noticed that I was struggling to finish my last wine glass and told me that I could take it to go! Bizarre but amazing!   Although I felt the food really deserved a 3 or 4 star rating, the service that I received from Tam made me feel like I was getting a 5 star experience.",

When I entered, there was vomit on the floor with a wet floor sign. After this unpleasant experience, I found it difficult to eat. Overall, the selection was minimal. My husband said the prime rib was good. What I did eat was salty and rather flavorless. After waiting awhile I decided to see if I could use the ladie's room. Nope, vomit was still there...twenty to thirty minutes later. Really? I informed a waiter and hoped it would be taken care of. I gave up on any hope of using the bathroom. The only really good thing we found in this visit was our waiter. He was great about bringing drinks when ours were empty. Desserts tasted cheap and mass produced. When I ordered a crepe the cook seemed annoyed to have to serve me. I would not suggest this buffet as there are so many others to visit.",

There wasn't a host/ess attending to the line, and when one finally did appear, they would leave after seating one party. Minutes later, a diff. host/ess would come saying they weren't sure how long the wait would be, etc. It was just a mess.    When we were finally seated, the service was great! Our server was super sweet and brought our drinks over and picked up our plates in a timely fashion. This made up for lack of service at the beginning.  The king crab legs, mussels, and truffled pasta are the top three things to get at this buffet. Along with the eclairs and creme brulee for dessert, you're set for a looooong food coma!   Otherwise, the rest of the food isn't anything special, though they do have a crepe station which has an extensive menu- sweet and savory options.   The one thing I do like about this place is the decor. The hotel has an ongoing Paris theme  that carries into the buffet. From the ceiling looking like the sky to the floor being a pebbled sidewalk, each area you're sitting in has a different view. It truly resembles a village in Paris!",

There was no line on a Saturday night when we were there, which is a plus because I've seen outrageous lines here when walking through Paris. Dinner is $33.99  There is a good selection of seafood and non-seafood items at the buffet, as well as a crepe bar, carving station and dessert area. The highlights were the juicy prime rib, freshly made crepes (both sweet or savory) and macaroons for dessert. The staff was very fast and efficient and seemed to clear our plates as we were done eating off of them. My only regret is that I didn't eat as much as I wanted to/could have because our friends were running late and by the time we had a couple plates it was already 9 pm...will definitely have to go back to check this place out again when I have more time. Definitely one of the better buffets on the strip",

We were fairly confident we could get our money's worth and so commenced our Tour de Fatties, Vegas 2018.  In the first 10 hours we made it to 3 of the 5 hotel buffets that are included in the price of the 24-hour pass - Paris Hotel, Flamingo Hotel and Planet Hollywood (you can pay extra for access to a couple more of the higher-end buffets). Since we are staying at Bally's, adjacent to The Paris Hotel, we started at Le Village Buffet at 2 PM with empty stomachs and high expectations. Sadly, we were underwhelmed with the quality of food and found it to be just slightly better than Old Country Buffet.  The best offering, hands down, was found at the crepe station. We each had a crepe made to order, topped with fruit and whipped cream. In fact, tomorrow we plan on stopping by Le Village Buffet to split a savory breakfast crepe and grab some coffee before we head over to our favorite buffet of The Tour:  Paradise Garden Buffet at The Flamingo Hotel.  **The thought of stopping at one buffet ON THE WAY to another buffet is shamefully gluttonous.  In our defense, the rest of our time was spent walking up and down The Strip.",

    "text": "JUST NO. One of the hardest things about vegas buffets is that once you start eating at the higher end ones, the older ones just don't seem as good. Le Village buffet for brunch was a waste of $, it was basically like paying for an overpriced Hometown Buffet. Maybe even worse 'cause at least Hometown Buffet offers carved ham. THAT'S RIGHT, LE VILLAGE DOESN'T SERVE CARVED HAM FOR BRUNCH!! I've never been to a buffet where they didn't have ham for brunch lol.  I don't even know where to start w/ the review on this buffet. I've never been to this buffet so we decided to try it. The line was moving pretty quickly and wait wasn't that long. It was $30 sunday w/ unlimited champagne, but too bad it took forever for our server to refill the drinks and on top of that she spilled TWICE on the table and it got on my friends. The service here is the worst I've seen, all the employees look like they hate their job and are miserable.  One of the MOST unorganized buffets EVER. Food items didn't match the labels and on top of that they put the omelette station at the window of the dessert station, like wtf? I requested an EGG WHITE omelette and the chef was giving attitude/lied that he didn't have egg whites left. LIKE BRO it's still early in the morning and your buffet isn't that busy, there's no way you have no more egg whites, so I said fine make it w/ the yolk then. After he finishes making the omelette he decided to say ok let me go to the back and check if there are any egg whites. LIKE WTF?! WHY DIDN'T U JUST GO IN THE BEGINNING BEFORE WASTING AN OMELETTE?!!? ON TOP OF THAT, WHEN HE WENT TO CHECK, HE LEFT MY MUSHROOMS/VEGGIES COOKING. They were near burning when he returned. The other chef in the dessert station even gave me the \"wtf? why'd he leave this cooking unattended\" look.  The desserts here sucked, for a buffet that is supposed to represent Paris, their pastries were HORRIBLE. Croissants were worse than costco, the macarons were nasty as well as the variety of carrot cake, cheese cake, etc. Tasted too artificial and worst than store bought at Albertson's. Talk about waste of calories for this buffet. The only good thing was the Crepe station and soft serve ice cream. Crepe station you can select from their menu of sweet or savory crepes. The banana nutella hazlenut crepe I got w/ vanilla ice cream was good, but the crepe needed more texture to it.  The prime rib and roast beef lacked flavor even w/ au jus added. It was cooked to medium rare but still tasted dry. The mushroom truffle flavor mac n cheese was horrible. The macaroni noodles were mush, not al dente at all, but at least the truffle flavor was there. The steamed veggies were like mush as well. The crab legs were constantly running out and it wasn't even that good. The crab meat seemed old.  BTW, they have restrooms in the buffet, but TOUGH LUCK! It is as horrible as the buffet cause THERE'S ONLY ONE STALL!!! I can just keep ranting on and on about how horrible this buffet is, but I'm sure ya'll get the point already. AVOID AT ALL COST!",

I can't again for the first time in 3+ years and it was just bad. Bad, bad, bad. We payed for holiday dinner prices ($40/person) and it wasn't even worth $10/ person. I struggled to find ways to fill my first plate. We came at the beginning of the dinner rush. So food should have been the most fresh and warm. The food looked disgusting. The smoked salmon looked like it was from last week. The lettuce was browning and dry. The pasta that I put on my plate was cold (how is that possible?). The dessert section was a shame. Old fruit and soggy pasties. This is the last time I will ever come here and I really don't see how the buffet can stay open much longer with this poor quality of food. Save your money and go somewhere else. I wouldn't eat here if it was for free.",

Le Village buffet is the happiest place on earth to me as far as Vegas buffets go. We paid an arm and a leg ($55 pp if I remember correctly) at the Wynn buffet and it was a disaster.  We had the Bellagio buffet the day before and it was worse than the hometown buffet, it was worth about $10, years ago, the Bellagio was an elegant place, a buffet fit for royalties, I still remember the opulence of everything, the chicken/beef wellington, pate, cornichons. It was outrageous there was no mayonnaise and little variety in the offerings. They had olives & weir cheese in everything.   Paris hotel, Le Village buffet had my favorite pate de campagne with cornichons! they even had chicken pate, it was so yummy, aioli to kill for. Their onion soup was always good but not this time, it was thick and tasted like it came out of a can. They had a real grill where fresh beef tritip was grilled in front of your eyes, chicken, sausages, hummus, fresh grilled veggies, French bread and pita pockets were also available.  Cuisine of 5 regions of France were represented. They had a crepe station where fresh crepes were made to order, I did not want to wait so I skipped it this time. I like the bouillabaisse but this time, there were no fish or scallops, only mussels and clams.  The shrimp cocktail was very good here, Bellagio cocktail sauce was not edible, too sweet and just tasted bad.  I was so stuffed, I was not able to eat much desert, I did have a flan, it was good but not enough caramel taste, no other restaurant I have been to have caramel sauce, If I want it, I would have to make it myself or go to Paris, it simply vanished from the US.  I don't understand the complaint of some reviewers, this is a French buffet if you want ham and turkey, you come to the wrong place!. Years ago, there were a few European chefs, now all the chefs/cooks were Hispanic plus the desire to save money, the buffet had been dumbed down just like on cruise ships, you cannot expect authentic cuisine under these circumstances. That said, this is the best buffet now, I have been to every buffet in Vegas and countless cruise ships, they are all very ordinary. BTW, the eyes eat too, I uploaded a few pictures of Paris hotel, the decorations in the Village buffet created an cozy ambiance, I felt like I was in Provence or Burgundy, Brittany, etc..After dinner, you walk over to have a drink under the chandeliers, sitting on a corset bar stool, it was pretty cool!",

There are also many other items that you don't always see elsewhere:  smoked salmon, a wide variety of cheeses, slab bacon, eggs benedict, various types of potatoes and sausages, and croissants and pastries as well as several egg selections and fruit..

He threw it up that night and no more buffets in the land of buffets.  The macarons looked good but were stale.  The crepes are cooked to order and the #1 Monkey crepe was excellent!

You can go across the street to the Bellagio for about $3 more and have a delicious and elegant breakfast buffet. The Paris space feels dark and the the buffet stations are not kept particularly neat. I sampled several food items all of which were very mediocre in flavor and quality. They had small bagels that were sort of hard and no available toaster. No condiments for the bagels anywhere near by. Presentation in general was not particularly appetizing. I'm generally pretty forgiving but overall this was a disappointing visit. Go to Bellagio or Wynn for better quality and beautiful surroundings.",

For being a hotel directly on the strip and with a name like Paris I feel like this buffet had a name to live up to and it sure did disappoint.   First of all the service sucked.  We saw our server once the whole time we were there. Only when he asked what we wanted to drink. We got no refills, no plates cleared, no \"do you need anything else.\" nothing.   Food was even worse. For the food that was there, since most items were empty, it was either underwhelming and bland or saltier then the sea. Everything looked old and made you question just how long everything was out. Only a couple of the dishes were labeled correctly so everything was a guessing game. Buffet in general was very small as well. Selection was tiny. Was looking forward to dessert hoping it would save the night but boy was I wrong. Flan was gross. Tasted packaged. The FRENCH macaroons weren't even made properly. (for those of you who do or don't know the smooth side is supposed to be out where you can see it and the ugly rough side should be inside) well then had it all wrong. And the only filling they had was chocolate on different color shells. Food overall was bad.  Now let's go for cleaniness. All the windows to guard the food had grease and grime all over it. Since they don't spend time on the food they should at least clean now and then.   Overall a very very disappointing buffet.",

I think anyone paying full price would be disappointed.  We went both for dinner and breakfast - both times avoiding the line by making OpenTable reservations.    For dinner, they seemed to have fewer and poorer offerings this year.  There is no more lamb, tri-tip or pork belly - or elaborate French dishes.  Cassoulet and a dry duck a l'orange seemed to be it.  The crepes are still fantastic, but they have reduced the types offered and also downgraded ingredients - no more mixed berries or chopped hazelnuts.  They only had one crepemaker working during both the dinner and breakfast rush, so waits can be very long.    Service was good during dinner, rushed over breakfast.    All in all, it was disappointing.  I wouldn't go back without the kids pressuring us to do so.",

For the savory I go with the ham and cheese and for the sweet I go with the Nutella and hazelnuts. The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because I never really eat anything else at the buffet.

Tonight most of the bowls were empty, and the remainder had very little in them.  Once the cheeses were imported, with a delicious blue.  Tonight the cheeses were what one would find in your neighborhood Safeway  At one point, each of the regional sections had a wide variety of fare from that region.  Tonight, each station had but a few selections, and nothing particularly special about any of them.  Once the dessert station was packed with many choices.

We met up with over 40 others (mostly Hawaii relatives) to celebrate my auntie's 80th B-day.  We were given our own section to make merry.  Oh lord, were we noisy!  \"Banzai!\" from the Japanese bunch.  \"Mabuhai!\" from the Filipino bunch.  \"Here, here!\" from our haoles.  Even had one of our younger generation performing a lovely hula for all of us and those seated by our section.  That's us...spreading the Aloha spirit even when in Paris!  The dinner food selection was outstanding! The various stations were well spaced so that, even on a busy Saturday night, civility reigned.  They even had a grilled section that was perfect for me.  Grilled veggies, meats & fish that I could enjoy without the fear of suffering from sauce overload later.  My stomach was already dancing from eating elsewhere, so this was appreciated.  The seafood cocktail section was pretty much wiped out by our clan. Once they discovered how sweet & meaty the crab legs were, loaded up plates kept coming into our section to be shared.  I tried two claws, but I think they might have been previously frozen.  I stuck mostly to the peel shrimp and made my own horseradish cocktail sauce.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZkGDCVKSdf8m76cnnalL-A?select=qcKcFwikTCV6uiGypV9LvA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/ZkGD...</a> Of course the menfolk were going crazy at the meat carving stations.    I was eyeing the big variety of foods coming to our table from the other gal cousins and was in envy.    A lot of French cuisine that I would have loved to try.  Pasta too.  I was sorely tempted by the risotto that was popular with the gals.   From their exclamations, I'd say they were enthusiastic about mostly everything they tried.    We had a lovely birthday cake for Auntie, but the others hit up that dessert station anyways.  I caved when someone put a creme brulee in front of me.  Soooooo good.  One of little kids in our group had four ice cream cones.  I did try a bite of one of those macarons that seems to be popular these days.  S'okay.  Service was good.  Our group was assigned two servers who were really on top of their game.   The section we were placed in was pretty spacious.  We didn't feel hemmed in.  For some reason though, I kept getting confused about our location and walked into two other group's parties.  \"Where'd this ol' Japanese lady come from?!?\"  Oops.  I know we'll be back someday.  The Buffet King said so.",

The reason it is a relative four is that Planet Hollywood is comprable to Home Town Buffet or other local buffet and Harrah's was SOS inedible, if I wasn't comp'd (I was comp'd as part of deal, not by Harrah's) for this place I would have been pissed.

The main thing is get there early for breakfast because if you come after 10 the line is pretty long which is no fun at all but its well worth the wait that's for sure. They sell beer,wine and cocktails but there mimosas are just Delicious .  Can't say enough great things about this place yes its a buffet but its a pretty good one and everything has such great taste and lots of flavor  and is so fresh which is a good thing .

The servers are indifferent at best; the food is barely adequate; and the place is just a mess, which is just inexcusable. Filthy food trays and trays of dirty utensils are just left in aisles.  The only reason we are there is because the buffet came with our room package.  Otherwise, you\"ll never catch me there again.",

    "text": "We tried the buffet at Le Village in Paris Paris on a friday night. We were smart to get the Groupon that came out recently so it was a good deal. I did see almost all the people pay retail $$$. The line was crazy, we waited almost an hour.  Firstly, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. I get that the ambience of the place was nice, but apart from that I wasn't impressed. The French ambience does make the experience a little nicer, as the buffet is organized by food from different provinces in France. That was the only interesting part , the food and service were really average.  Food - I wasn't impressed by the variety, It contained only French varieties, and no delicacies. In Vegas, one does walk in expecting some level of opulence, delicacies and surprises, especially if I am paying $40pp, which were missing. Of course, since it was only French menu, the few dishes they had were well prepared. However, as a vegetarian, there was barely anything tasty to eat. The made to order crepes were the saviors. Although, they were very nice, delicate and well prepared, I have had better crepes in food trucks in Austin. Apart from that, all there was, were 4 different kinds of potatoes to eat! Really, after All the hype about French cooking, I was expecting some nicely prepared vegetarian options. Even the bread collection was so mundane, you can find those in your local cafeteria.  The macaroons were the highlight of the dessert section, but again, what if they're flour less and delicate? A cookie is still just a cookie, bake me a nice cake! No cheesecakes, no tortes, no ice cream. The seafood collection seemed ton be nice and people were enjoying the crab legs. There was a decent grilled chicken in a so called Mediterranean section, but nothing else looked interesting. I saw shrimp, clams but nothing seemed grilled or spiced. Probably the worst hummus I've had was here. Even the usual suspects, like pizza, Mac n cheese which are kid friendly were missing or scarce.  The drinks and Service - we had the bottle of wine with our package, but didn't feel like having it then. The server said, their policy was that they had to open it! Bummer. We got the red wine and it was a nice balanced Cabernet. There were other drinks like ice teas, sodas, mimosas,beers etc. The server didn't return for the remainder of our dinner and never asked to refill our drinks or bring any other. They have waitresses dressing up in old French maid costumes but they are really old and cannot keep up with the tables. There were so many empty tables, but they couldn't get them cleaned in time to get guests seated.  I'd say, forget the French hype and go for a more traditional buffet next door at pH.",

Paris/Bally's, Rio, Imperial Palace, Harrahs, and Caesars when they reopen it in mid summer. So you will see a couple of reviews for Buffets here.   The Paris/Bally's buffet (which is misleading because it says Bally's and Paris have their own separate buffets but they don't) is pretty decent. They have fresh cut meats, their Creme brulee is to die for, and they have a crepe station that you can order desert or dinner crepes.   Service was pretty bad, getting drinks refilled was almost impossible. They also have an all you can drink wine/beer that you can tack on for 19.99 (Don't do it here...Harrah's does the same and it includes champagne for 10.00)  The quality of food here is about 4 star but the 3 star rating was for the service. Our drink waiter was not attentive and that was frustrating.",

First of all, if you dine here for breakfast, you must try the crepes.  I got a berry-filled crepe with raspberry coulis and it was one of the top crepes I've had.  The only issue with this station is that they really stick to their menu and don't customize your choice.  So you're pretty much out of luck if you wanted to add some bananas to your berry crepe.  There was a vast selection of breakfast food - they had every type of breakfast potato, including hash browns, roasted, scalloped and shredded - and it didn't taste like cheap buffet food.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I am definitely returning here for breakfast.",

We arrived at the buffet pretty late (for dinner) because we didn't want to wait in the huge lines, but our plan failed. After getting into the dining area, I was shocked at how small and limited the stations were. The seafood selection there totally sucked; the crab legs were tasteless and didn't even hold before chewing....All of the meat selections were extremely dry and hard to access because of the lines and positioning of the food. The best thing this buffet has to offer is their roasted vegetables, and deserts. That's it. I was craving a nice salad after eating so unhealthy and they only had one type of salad with about 3 toppings.   The waitstaff was pretty friendly but they were overwhelmed by how many people were in there at once. We even had to come back to a couple of stations that ran out of food because there wasn't more prepared to be put out right away. For $25, I would not recommend this place.",

Le Village Buffet looks like it was taken out of Belle's running through the town and singing scene in Beauty and the Beast.  It's a mimic of the outdoors even though you're really inside and it has that Disneyland cheese factor to it.  Breakfast food has always been obsolete in my life.  I like eating whatever it is in the fridge, albeit not falling into traditional breakfast food categories.  So being overly exposed to five kinds of eggs, eight kinds of bagels, three kinds of sausages, and 10 kinds of breads plus many more varieties of the essentially the same thing... is nauseating.  The line gets really long once you get near 11am from people checking out, finally getting through their hangovers, and what not.  This normally costs $19.99 but like I had said for my review of Cafe Lago, this can be part of the $34.99 all day buffet pass you get.",

I did not stay in Paris so I can't review the hotel but as I walked through the hotel to the buffet I got a glimpse of it and it was so cute. They have little patisseries and French signs all over to make it feel authentic. The line for the buffet was quite long but moved surprisingly quickly. I was adamant about eating a crepe for breakfast so I refused to leave. What I really liked about this buffet in particular is they do not take a break from breakfast to lunch or dinner they just gradually change the dishes so I got to sample the breakfast and lunch buffet. The food was soooooo good. I had this amazing steak and potato has with real chunks of tender beef, smoked salmon, something that resempled scalloped potatoes without the cheese but lots of sauteed onions and mussels. They have stations that represent the different regions in france which I thought was a good idea and helps break stereotypes. I have no complaints about the food!  I wanted to go on my last day but I didn't have enough time. The crepes were divine. I ordered the mixed berry one and walked over to the ice cream stations and topped it off. PERFECTION! Next time I'm in vegas I will be stopping here for brunch.   My only point of criticism if the bathroom. There was only one toilet in a buffet! Which means line ups. Wasn't too pleased about that but the food made up for it.",

Since Le Village is French, you will get some pastries to go along with your normal breakfast variety. In Vegas, you must eat breakfast as a hangover cure, if you can wake up. Unfortunately, the breakfast closes at 11am, so be there early. There is always a line, because this buffet is very popular.  I was able to spoil myself with fresh made omelets, Eggs Benedict, and both French Toast and pancakes. Don't forget to have a crepe for dessert. I know that sounds like a lot of food, but hey this is a Vegas buffet so SSHH! Diets and feeling fat can wait until you return home. I recommend looking for $5 off coupons or 2 for 1 coupons if you can. I'm not sure if they apply to breakfast though. If you are a breakfast fan, head over to Paris and give it a try. Don't except a True Paris experience, but the American will work just fine. The decorations and server clothing kind of reminds me of Disneyland.",

The macrons way too crunchy, cookies, cakes, creme brulee, etc.... crepe fill with frozen strawberry - the batter too thick - never again  Cooked mussels & clams - unflavored Pasta dishes which all looked unappealing,  Chicken soup - Awful  Missing is a little more ethnic food variety- expect from a French-themed restaurant.

They had the basic American breakfast; pancakes, eggs, sausage, omelets etc. And they had a section for a bit of French breakfast--sorry I forgot what they were. I just ate several plates of salad (lol) and typcial pancake with sauages and bacon! It was good, nothing special.... But their OJ...that was bomb! Tasted like it was freshly squeezed!

There were several flavors and all of them were delicious! Not too hard, not too soft, not too sweet! My brothers who are normally indifferent about macaroons ate several of them!   We all had the buffet of buffet pass so we literal came back into the Le Village throughout the day just to snag several macaroons! Short lines, 24 hr pass, unlimited macaroons, why not?",

    "text": "This buffet is just OK. It's got my two faves--crab legs and prime rib. However, this isn't the best buffet you're going to find in Vegas. It is part of the 24-hour buffet pass but I would skip this one next time.   The decor is cute and very French village-esque. However, the selection seems small. The crab legs ran out and weren't refilled quickly. So, I only got to have a small serving. I do like they are already cut in half for easy eating though. I liked the mussels in arrabbiata sauce but I don't know if this is just a specialty item. There isn't anything too out of the ordinary in the dessert section either. Mostly just pastries.  FYI- they are strict with carding here for the mimosa brunch so don't forget your ID. Also, the bathroom in the actual buffet is small so make sure to go to the casino instead!",

    "text": "The best part of this buffet is the Crepe station. I am somewhat of a crepe connoisseur and this place being a French inspired buffet did not disappoint at all  with their crepes. They have a savory section and a sweet section so I tried one from each and both were really good. When it comes to crepe it's really all about the batter because the filling is almost the same everywhere else.  The other highlight of this buffet is their prime rib, which they also serve for lunch as well. Those were really the main highlights of it.   The selection in general is not very extensive or specialized. It's on a much smaller scale with their food selection compared to the other buffets in Vegas. But do try out their crepes! And I'd go to that station first since there's usually a line for it.",

There were lots of choices but they fell way below our expectations. For example, the grilled squash was too garlic, slimy with olive oil and cold. The prime rib was flavorless and filled with grizzle. It was not palatable at all. For desert I chose an eclair that was school cafeteria quality. I spent over $150.00 for three of us to eat and drink. I doubt I will ever return to Las Vegas but if I do, I will steer clear of Paris. It is Memorial Day weekend, if you are in Las Vegas, look somewhere else for a decent meal. There are many great places.",

    "text": "I came here last year in November for brunch with my family and really really enjoyed it. They serve mimosas on the weekends so we were able to enjoy that last time. I went here this past week with my husband, as a part of the Buffet of Buffets deal. We tried Rio & Planet Hollywood and agreed this was the better of the 3. Line wasn't long around dinnertime so I only waited about 7 minutes total to be seated. The waiters are very friendly, and the theme is very nice. I think I enjoyed my experience much more last time because it was my first time there, but I felt the food wasn't as fresh this time around.  Dinner:  A good portion of the hot items were dry because they had been left out for a while, and the Truffle mac n cheese (which I enjoyed last time) was very, very dry. Crab legs were cut in half, which made eating more convenient, but I thought they didn't taste very fresh. I remember the cut tri-tips being amazing last time, but the ones at dinner were dry on the top, which made for tough chewing. Everything else is pretty decent. Ended dinner with creme brulee. yumm.  Brunch: We came back the following morning for brunch because we wanted to give this buffet another chance. Truffle Mac n cheese was gooey and fresh this time, and the roast beef was pretty good too. I really enjoyed the sausages (really tasty) and brussel sprouts. Crepes didn't really spark my interest so I decided to go for the fresh omelettes, which were quite tasty. Ended my brunch with creme brulee. yumm  Tip: Try filling your plate with small, bite-size portions so you'll get a taste of everything and know what you like. I highly recommend going in the early afternoon because it's busier and food is constantly being refreshed. 3 stars for dinner, 4 stars for breakfast..soo 3.5 stars actually haha",

We went for brunch so we could get a taste of lunch and breakfast.  I didn't think anything was really a standout, most buffet food tastes the same to me.    I stood in line at the crepe station for a long ass time...it wasn't really worth it to me, but it was still pretty good.    There was so many different eggs and breakfast meat/sausage type things, I always wonder why white folk come in hoards for breakfast...it always tastes the same to me...",

    "text": "We will not be going again.  We just had breakfast buffet Sunday morning.  We arrived about an hour after they opened and were seated right away.  I researched blogs, and ratings and this buffet came up as one of the best in Las Vegas. I was willing to pay the extra for what was described as a really good buffet.    I was so excited, and unfortunately was very disappointed.   The good:  The ambiance and service was good.  I liked the sweet polenta, lox's and the sliced ham.  My husband liked the savory sausage bread pudding. The mediocre:  Pretty much all other food was so so and nothing to rave about.  The crepe bar was a nice touch, but the actual product wasn't a big deal. The Bad:   1. If you are going to charge $25.00 a person for a breakfast buffet you should not be recycling your bread products!  Really???  One of the least expensive things, and they couldn't toss the incredibly stale leftovers from the day before?  I got a bagel and it was a definite leftover from the day before.  I thought maybe I had just picked a bad one, I went back and checked all flavors with the tongs, and a sampling of all bagels in each basket thinking maybe they put the fresh ones towards the back...nope.  They bagged up yesterdays, and put them back out in the morning.  The croissants were small and over cooked and nothing special....for a french themed buffet you'd think they could have had some fresh baked ones to offer.  Again the pastries and bread products are subpar. 2. The melon offerings were thin and not replenished - empty bowls sitting there. 3. Quite a few of the signs telling you what the item was that was on the buffet were wrong.  I'll assume no one took the time to change the signs from the buffet the night before?  Or maybe they have been like that for months...who knows.  I wish we had gone to Golden Corral (do they have one in Vegas) for  1/2 the price and in my opinion a lot better breakfast offerings.  I feel ripped off.",

I was here at lunch and ate mostly seafood (mussels, shrimp, Seafood Bouillabaisse) and later crab (we had a late lunch and they switch their menu to dinner at 3pm on week days) and it was all good. Also tried some grilled veggies (but grilling makes them all taste the same). The caprese salad was good. Sushi was a miss (there were 2 types and they weren't good). For dessert I enjoyed some flan and creme brulee. I was excited about the macaroons, but the 2 that i tried were too sweet. Wish I left some room for the infamous crepes, but I didn't so I just had a bite of someone else's berry crepe and it was delicious!",

The champagne brunch on Sunday was just terrific as you can have unlimited champagne or mimosa's. The buffet here has a lot of variety and you can get crepes here made to order plus other cooking stations around for made to order items. The prime rib and tri-tip steak was just heavenly good, tender and moist. Yumm!!!  This is one of my favorites in term of ambience because it looks like a small village inside the buffet. Very cozy if you can get a table right in the middle of where the buffet area is at and the lighting is lower there.  The service was great as they always refilled our glass with champagne glasses over and over a few times without asking even though they were very busy.",

There were different stations for serving up the food with different french names for each such as Le Maison or Le Creperie. They had a wide selection of food and it was all fresh. The Yukon gold mashed potatoes were so amazing. Their steak and prime rib were really good too. I was full pretty quickly which makes me partially regret the high cost of the buffet but hey its Vegas! Not only was the dinner good but the dessert bar had every pastry you could think of! I'd be back soon if there weren't so many other good places to try on the strip!",

The corned beef hash was missing corned beef and thus lacked a distinct flavor beyond the potatoes.    Not worth a special trip.  You're better off ordering something you really like and made to order at a decent breakfast place.  Last point... The \"maple syrup\" is not.  It's not even maple flavored.",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast and I made sure I got enough food that I paid for. They have a large arrangement of foods. I got fruit, pancakes, hashbrowns, their definition of oatmeal, turkey bacon and sausage.  Let me start off with the negative and finish with the good.  Pancakes are one of my favorite food no matter what they, I can eat it for lunch, dinner or anytime in between. These pancakes are small and I have no complaints there, easier for them to fit in my mouth. The only problem I had with them is that they kinda taste like school cafeteria pancakes, at least the first 4 did but the other 2 didn't really taste that bad. I've had better pancakes at home. Their hashbrowns had no flavor what so ever. Where the seasonings at? The potatoe triangle I got was kinda hard. The waffle wasn't that amazing, nor was I expecting it to taste so great based on the rating. They were just regular ol waffles to me. Don't get me started on the oatmeal. I usually don't put brown sugar in my oatmeal but I had to this time because let me tell, this oatmeal had no flavor whatsoever. It could be because it's all natural but even Trader Joe's Steel Cut oats have more flavor than their oatmeal. The turkey bacon, the turkey bacon spiked my blood pressure, I can feel it. It was soft and had too much salt, although some people may like their turkey bacon soft but I like it more with a crisp crunch to it, like the regular bacon they had out. I had to eat it cause I don't just waste food like that.  Now let's end with the good.  Turkey sausage was one of best things I had. Didn't taste any different from the ones at home. The fruit, I give it up to who ever picks out their fruit cause they had flavorful, sweet, juicy pieces of pineapple, cantaloupe and honeydew. You will occasionally get those non good pieces but those that were sweet were good. I can't even pick out a ripe honeydew or fruit if my life depended on it. That's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.",

Maybe I am just too much of a plebe to understand the joy of it. However, I LOVED it here.  The place is sort of interesting because we went on a monday and the line was ENORMOUS. We stood in line for a while and were checked in and god two bottles of wine which was pretty terrible, but it was with our meals so I couldn't complain about it too much. Also we were seated at a table, which had no utensils and it took them forever to get u the utensils.  I personally thought that the food was very good for a buffet type setting. If the food was not in the buffet medium I probably would be more harsh on it, but for what it was, it was pretty decent. The dolma were kinda aweful, but the different stews and pasta dishes were very decent especially considering the medium of buffet.

    "text": "This review is for the breakfast buffet. I love breakfast foods and this buffet pretty much has it all. And with a beautiful, serene environment that makes you feel like you are in a small outdoor cafe in the early evening.   There is a Crepe bar (i had strawberry/banana), an omelet station, of course, then there were the benedicts, quiches, and other egg dishes. Many different potato dishes and corned beef hash (to die for). And don't forget the sliced ham, bacon, and/or sausages. Of course there were multitudes of pastries, bagels, french toast, and the likes. And for a decent buffet price.   Bottom line: if you want a variety of breakfast items, this is the buffet for you.",

    "text": "Years ago, I went to this buffet and enjoyed it quite immensely as it was one of my first Vegas buffets. Last week, I came back to this former favorite to see what had become of it. It was a little bit disappointing.  I tried to hit a little bit of all the appetizing items. The prime rib was pretty solid. The beef bourguignon, pork belly, and the bouillabaisse were probably the standouts of the whole thing. Well, except for desserts. There were some really nice options, like the creme brulee and the cheesecake. My dessert crepe (#2 I believe, with the berries) was also good, if a little big.  The big problem is that the crab legs mostly sucked, and there was such a small serving area for it compared to huge platter that they used to have. What gives? Everybody knows you go to a Vegas buffet for crab legs. Also, the lamb was pretty dry, and there just wasn't as much of a variety as there are at some of the bigger buffets.  Luckily, I was able to use the Groupon on this trip and enjoyed a couple glasses of Blue Moon. They also have red table wine and something else that didn't sound appealing to my memory banks. Not too bad if you're looking to get a little buzzed with your meal. But if you're just gonna go eat, then hit the Bacchanal, which I'm still in love with despite news of their ever-increasing prices.",

I was so hungry that I ate so much so fast that I didn't even have room for dessert, which is a first for me.  There should always be room for dessert.  LOL.  But I guess I enjoyed the Truffle pasta a bit too much.    The food is good.  Nothing too spectacular about it.    Plus, I can't really complain because I ate here for FREE.

    "text": "Ok, so going to Vegas, you have to do at least one buffet. However this place should not be on your bucket list.  Crab legs...yes, prime rib yes....but both were of low quality and the prime rib was super dry. And yah, it's supposed to be a French buffet so they did have some of my macarons, but they were gross and unappealing. They didn't care about the presentation at all with respect to the macarons.  The food handles were sticky and gross. There's no wet naps or purell nearby. It's like someone purposefully lathered the the food handles with syrup and pretty much played a prank on everyone. Gross, and unattended, and lack of ownership amongst the cleaners and food servers.  The waitress knows who you are too, ethnicity, etc...so when she saw a bunch of filipinos, she got into Filipino mode. I guess she really wants to provide that awesome customer service, that or she wants a fat tip at the end. Either way, she was pretty attentive.   It was a Sunday, so champagne was included. They went all out with the Wycliff Jean champagne....whewwww. Mix with the oj and you get the mimosa. Not bad, they even allowed us to keep the bottle to walk aimlessly throughout the casino and along the vegas strip.  For $30, I would probably invest a little more somewhere else next time. This was more of a cafeteria leftovers like food with mediocre quality instead of the higher more quality food that can be found elsewhere.",

And I'd have to say this place is better than the average buffet, but truly doesn't have any unforgettable moments. Yes, it has a crepe station. But it's only average at best. Options are very simple. Choose your fruit. Choose your sauce. Second time I went, they had run out/didn't put out the nutella. Boooooo.  But it's great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Le Village doesn't go out of their way to impress you by something impressive or new-  you're sure to find familiar foods here.   For sure, nothing bad. You'll get full.

I was also a little disappointed that they didn't have any fish option! The place is beautiful in the inside. It looks like a small village in Paris, the servers are dressed as villagers. For breakfast I had scramble eggs, home style potatoes and they were really  good. I also had a banana crepe they made. It was delicious!!! That was actually my favorite part. Then I went and had some steaks, pork and mash potatoes. Everything was good buy like I said I was a little disappointed they didn't have fish!! They had crab legs that were cut in half so it made them easier to eat. I didn't like the service because the lady barely showed up to our table. The plate piled up and I ran out of water. I Couldn't leave without trying the dessert section in that section they also make the omelets ( I found out too late :'( ) The dessert section had macaroons, and a bunch of cakes, croissants, ice cream. It was amazing!! Hopefully for my next experience I will get better service but I would definetely come back.",

This buffet had a few negative reviews, mostly centered around peoples' expectations or their service. Well, I figured out the secret - if you have a large group, reserve ahead of time on Open Table (at least a day or so).  I came solo on a business trip, had no wait, and fantastic service. I overheard the waitstaff talking and the area I was seated in is referred to as VIP - reason being, I tipped and was polite.   Food wise, there are some fantastic options. My favorites were the truffle oil Mac and cheese, the fresh roast beef, stuffed lamb, and the sauteed mushrooms. They have crab legs, but they are cold and I didn't see a means to warm them on the buffet itself. There is a $12.99 all you can drink special (that's alcohol, folks) - so if that's your thing it's absolutely worth it.   I enjoyed my time at La Village and would definitely return.",

But I also feel that there are plenty of off Strip buffets that are better than this one (such as The M and Red Rock).   Some things didn't seem to be quite as fresh as they should be (the tri-tip and the duck), but others were fine. My husband particularly enjoyed the prime rib and said it was actually some of the best he's ever had. He also enjoyed the mac n cheese. My favorites were the andouille sausage and the potatoes gratin.   Now their dessert spread I thought was a little better (except for the Macarons, which were VERY dry). They had chewy brownies, warm sauces to top your crepe or bread pudding and the creme Brulee was decent.   The service was actually pretty great! I've come to have low expectations, but these servers were on top of it!",

Our waitress pretty much forgot about us. She did not bring us the right drinks, nor did she even get us refills. She brought water.   The crepes are the best I've ever had. Made right in front of you however you want it. The chef made my girlfriend a special one with the whipped cream on the inside and refused to make it like that for anyone else who asked. Thought that was funny. The prime rib was also amazing. It was perfectly medium rare, not raw like at Bacchanal, and seasoned to perfection.   I always enjoy restaurants that go above and beyond with their theme and I have to say that Paris does a great job at this. Not having been to Paris, I can safely say that this is the closest to the real thing. It feels like you can just forget about real life and pretend for a while. Very nice decor and atmosphere at this buffet (and casino in general).   The service is not great, but everything else is.",

Furthing the buffet, total cost averaged $33.00 per person. Not terrible. Crepe's were available for dessert, again not terrible, therefore, I would have awarded the buffet at two stars.

It doesn't not have everything one the menu so you may still need to ask.  The one thing I was very disappointed with is that the macaroons have gluten . This is the one sweet thing I totally enjoyed while I was in Paris last year.   they will change that soon. Otherwise if you have a sweet tooth and need GF, your only options are bananas foster or Creme brulee (when available)",

It was one of the best buffets on the Strip and worth the price.   Unfortunately, the current selections and quality has gone way downhill..... crab legs were flavorless and we actually saw them being taken out of a plastic bag and dumped in the tray during our visit (Another Yelper described them as being \"still FROZEN\"!).   The crepes took forever to be made by a guy who could be The Soup Nazi's brother (seriously) and we were the only ones in line....which should have been our first clue...there's usually a very long line. Don't get the chicken & mushroom crepe unless you like crumbled up chicken pieces and large fingery mushrooms.... (no sauce or cheese, making it DRY ingredients inside of a crepe shell....NO).   Pastry Chef: Your Worker Bee is putting the Macaron filling on the WRONG side. Just sayin'.....  Two of the most iconic French cuisine items that should have been on point, well.... were NOT.  \"The Fish Stinks From the Head\"..... aka Management FAIL.   Au Revoir, Le Village Buffet. :'-(",

That being said, I didn't want to set my expectations too high.  And I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe lunch and dinner is different than breakfast, but I was super impressed with the selection of food. Lots of breakfast meats. Crepe station, omelette station, pastries, waffles with strawberry sauce, fruits, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, quiches - the list probably goes on! I would recommend eating here and the prices are decent.  People were commenting on the staff being rude. I didn't come across one rude person, in fact,  they were all super sweet, friendly and helpful. The omelette guy was amazing and entertaining. Our waitress always had our drinks filled and someone else was removing plates from our table as we finished with them.  We did make a reservation which wasn't needed at the time we went. But regardless, I'd make a reservation. We tried for dinner one night and the wait was an hour and a half.",

However, he used his hand with the same gloves, picked up the macaron one by one and moved them to the serving tray to serve the customers. In addition, I oVer heard another worker told an customer that \"I don't have a spoon, go ask your server, don't ask me\". I don't know if I'm too picky or not, you make the call.....The only thing I can tell you is, for sure the kids don't like that place if they were treated badly.",

The prime rib was great too, depending on the cook. The first half of our dining experience had a great chef that made the prime rib, juicy and tender. When I went for thirds, it was a new chef and a new slab of meat and it wasn't as good as the first.",

The dessert area had fruit flys on the macaroons and the station was filthy with dirty, oily ceiling and frames.  With that said, I didn't dare try any desserts.  I'm sure the ice cream/yogurt machine was fine.    How do I add the video of the fruit flies?",

If she refuses to move one step to her left from her spot behind her register to grab the card of the person she is doing the transaction with in an incredibly crowded line, maybe she should wait until I'm closer to the register before initiating the transaction, rather than have me push and reach over the group in front of me to hand her my card.  Was not impressed with the food or selection.  Wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't what I'd expect from a Vegas buffet that charges $30 for brunch.  Also, the fly on top of a croissant that flew away as I picked up the tongs wasn't very appetizing.   Our server was terrible. We got drinks and were not offered refills until we were already done with our meals. Our plates for a party of 5 sat stacked on our table for at least 15 minutes before we decided to bus our own table and take them to a busboy who just stood next to the dirty plate cart, avoiding eye contact with us as we tried to get his attention.   Overall, not a good experience. We will not be back, and I would not recommend this buffet if you plan to visit Vegas. There is no shortage of other great restaurants with quality food and service that you should search for on Yelp before making a decision on where to spend your hard-earned money to dine.",

I would say that the best part of this place would be the crepes. They are made fresh by the chef. They have so many different options. It's really so hard to chose just one.  What would make this buffet better would be having fresher options and having more options. Perhaps, having more French food would be cool.

Caesars Bacchanal took us 25 minutes at peak time.   The Price: $33 with tax per person at dinner time. They did have a $13 with tax option for unlimited wine or beer, but we didn't go for that.   The Seating: They seated us in a small room where you couldn't enjoy much of the Parisian atmosphere that was the main reason we wanted to try Le Village. I asked the waiter if we could move to one of the small empty tables and he actually started laughing. It was very unprofessional.   So I asked a manager if we could have one of the empty tables for two rather than the one for four that we were seated at in a small room off to the side. She said no -- and that that those tables were for members of Total Rewards Platinum or whatever the higher categories are. Seriously, this is a buffet not a fancy restaurant. And there were empty tables everywhere and we had to sit in a small room where you can't see anything. We just wanted to see the Parisian themes and the buffet itself. Denied.   The Seafood: They had crab legs but they were very salty. They were not as good as at Caesars, Bellagio, or Aria buffet. All those three others had raw oysters, and Le VIllage didn't. The shrimp at Le Village were very small and not worth the time. They did have good cooked mussels.   The Meats: OK.    The Service: WORST of the ones I mentioned above. The don't seem to care as much about giving good service. Even asked to have a manager call me so I could make some suggestions and never heard back. That says a lot.",

If I had to place a my current favorites would have to be... Bellagio being the better one over Paris. But going back on topic, the highlights of this buffet were the following and will be updated once pics are uploaded and such:  *-Indicates my personal favorites...  Drinks: Waters all around w/ my Glass of Sprite  First Round: -Prime Rib (red and succulent, a bit tough to chew) -Short Rib (perfectly cooked, came off the bone quite nicely)* -Pesto Pasta (consistent with what I've had in the past) -Truffle Mash Potatoes (barely got the taste of truffle, maybe it wasn't accented) -Roasted Duck (too much oil and lacked any protein to consume)  Second Round: -Duck Confit (much better in seasoning, not as oily, full of skin)* -Greens w/ Balsamic Vinaigrette (lettuce and dressing, nothing more) -Ravioli (Cannot recall the type of cheese, it escapes me, but filling) -Mac and Cheese (I can make better, it was shaved with a lot of Parmesan and something else)  Third Round (Dessert): -Peanut Butter Cookie (second favorite dessert, moist and gooey) -Creme Brulee (yeah it's that good; not pictured I consumed four more; perfectly caramelized crunch on top, the creamy core is magnificent)****** -Whipped Lemon Tart (I'm not a big fan of lemon meringue, it's tart and moist for the most part) -Raspberry Cheesecake (again moist, with a good balance of tart raspberry would have preferred it to be Strawberry)  Total cost of Buffet came out to about $22.00 with tip. Good times, I ordered about two other plates for which I did not have pictures of. But all I remember was being a fatty and consuming more Creme Brulees, Duck Confit, Short Rib, and Salad. 3.5 is my rating for now.",

Probably should have tried the desserts, people were saying good things about the creme brulee and the crepes looked very good but were huge and we were doing the 24 hour buffet of buffets and didn't want to stuff ourselves.  Sorry to be picky, but the reason I knocked it down to only two stars was because everything was incredibly poorly labeled. Or unlabeled. Or had labels still lying around from breakfast that were clearly wrong. It was just frustrating and wasteful to end up with some stuff you didn't know what it was or like.",

We got the 5-buffets-for-24-hours deal, and managed to hit this one up for breakfast twice ;D go first 2 hrs or something after they open, then come back the next day right when they open. Of all the buffets we tried via this dealio (although Caesars was CLOSED FOR REMODELING grrrrr), this was my favorite.  The Paris hotel has gotten a lot of things right - the atmosphere is awesome, the Sugar Factory is kickarse, and Le Village is tres bon. Ou est la bibliotheque?

When I asked to sit some other place, I could see the displeasure of the lady who led us to there. After waiting more than 10 minutes, we were guided to a table right next to a pillar. Obviously not very pleasant place to sit. They shouldn't have any table placed in such location.  Foods there are generally good looking and has a good variety, but I am not sure how long they've been there. Many seafood dishes are over-cooked because they have been in the warmers too long (I know what I am trying to say). The waiter was not very friendly, nor very attentive. One time we had 4 empty dishes along with 3 dishes we are working on. Everytime I needed something, I had to look around and find the waiter for few minutes.  The only nice thing about this buffet is the ambience is French street. If oyu have to feel that without spending time and money to travel France, this is the place to be. Otherwise, I recommend you not to visit this place.",

They had a line for fresh made crapes, as well as all the usual buffet staples. There was plenty to sample with every empty plate, that looked delicious (and mostly was).  One thing I will say is they do not staff wisely there. I tend to eat late, so 4:00 (which was my lunch) was a perfect time to just walk in. But just a half hour later the line spans down the block of Paris. All of this while the restaurant is half empty, they should really get more staff.  So of the buffet of buffet deals, this was by far the best of the four restaurants I tried.",

It had similar quality food to the MGM Grand buffet that we had eaten breakfast at the day before, but less selection. They have a crepe station thingy here, but I didn't think those were all that great, so what is the damn point.   Really, I would only be giving it two stars, except for one thing: You can pay an extra $10 per person and get right to the front of the line! Yessir, capitalism at its finest, and I was more then happy to pony up the extra dough at noon on a Sunday when every breakfast buffet in town had an hour wait to get it.   So, if you're a stepper, and you're starving, and all the buffets in town are packed, this is a good place. If you're a mooch, and the line is long, keep walking.",

    "text": "Oh what a shame. The quality of this buffet has gone down so much it's almost as bad as the writing in my original review.   When we arrived on Memorial Day weekend for Champagne brunch, we found no line. The cashier told us the buffet would be self serve, which didn't click initially to me (aren't all buffets 'self serve'?). As our host escorted us to our seats, she reiterated that our experience would be self serve, including non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks. They had recently added a section of fountain drinks and the bar was available for ordering unlimited mimosas.   The sad part about this change is that it degrades Le Village Buffet into Souplantation or Hometown Buffet status. The service is essentially nonexistent and with that came tables upon tables that were un-bussed.   The saving grace? The prime rib and the crepe station. These are probably the only items worth eating in the entire buffet. The crab legs here were horrible, thin, icy, and bland. Most other dishes were forgettable.   The other reason you might consider coming here? It's a lot cheaper than a lot of the other high end buffets that have taken over the strip like Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon. The price point being around $40/person makes it a much more affordable option.   Pro tip: If you're looking for the omelette station, it's in the middle of the dessert bar.",

On the other hand, the crepes are made fresh but there's no place to warm up the savory omelette ingredients such as the ham, spinach and artichokes. There's plenty of breads, pastries, and flatbread if you need to load up on some carbs. Their flatbread is tasty and has been one of my favorites for years.   The buffet for the most part has become a bit tired and offers the same thing over and over. Last night the steamer was not working so it was just cold crab legs.   The french onion soup they serve for lunch and dinner has always been delicious. If you like onions you will love this soup, as it's loaded with onions. Overall, the food is very average. You have to go super high end like the Bacchanal, Wynn's and The Bellagio for fantastic buffets.",

I never go to buffets because I just can't comprehend how people stuff themselves to the point of stomach achiness and exhaustion, lol. Btw...yeah I can't handle Golden Corral either....hehehe.  But here I was....visiting Las Vegas for the weekend with a couple of friends. And my one buddy who had eaten here in the past, swore by this place.  Since we were all compromising on our group decisions for what to see and do....off we went...over to Le Village Buffet for a rip your face off, all you can eat buffet!  We visited on a random Saturday evening around 7pm over the summer time and the line to be seated was pretty long...extended out the door! We waited roughly 30 minutes before making it to the front.   Along the way, while standing in line, you pay for the buffet. Since I wasn't used to eating at buffets, it was a pretty large shock to my system when the hostess mentioned it was $35!!!  Wow, I was thinking maybe Paris Hotel is pretty upscale and that's how they charge so much??  Or I thought as well, maybe since I never visit buffets, in this day and age...that's how much buffets cost! Or maybe exclusively while vacationing in Vegas...that's how things work! Oh well...we were on vacation and it was okay to pay $35....it was just a surprise, that's all.  Finally being seated....I must give this place credit. It genuinely felt like I was sitting down in a quaint little cafe in Paris and having an authentic French meal. The atmosphere was pretty cool and certainly helped me forget $35 (which didn't include gratuity). Btw...I had heard from other guests while standing in line that you can combine buffet meals over a 24 hour period at different locations on the strip all for one reasonable price. Though....I just can't understand how after someone eats at a buffet for one meal....the very next day they can return for a whole new buffet?!?! Ugh, this whole process reminded me of being stranded on a cruise ship where you eat unlimited for 1 week and gain 15 pounds, lol. Whatever...  The buffet was good though. Instead of holding back, I dove straight in and helped myself to almost everything. Le Village's selections of entrees and side items included mostly any type of French cuisine you could think of. Some dishes that stood out included...prime rib, snow crab legs, truffle mac and cheese and mouthwatering pretzel rolls!  Incredible....for dessert you can have you own made to order crepes! I couldn't believe how I even had an ounce of appetite left for dessert. Since crepes are one of my favorite sweets...I splurged and somehow found room, lol. Yeah the crepes were delicious and fresh.  Ultimately, I pigged out at Le Village Buffet....and although I haven't returned to a buffet since this gargantuan meal back in June, it was still a pleasant and traditional way of dining the way tourists do while living it up in Las Vegas.",

My water cup was never empty, and my table was kept clean in a nice quick way, when I come to review the buffet I make it a point to try a little bit of everything , tonight was difficult because the food quality just was not there. The food tastes like it comes from Sysco, and then is \"remastered\" in the kitchen .. my poor Macroons they were crunchy , The desserts looked really good but didn't taste exceptionally how I had hoped it's all good though,  I'll come back again sometime later this year and try it out one more time.

Didn't have to wait for even a single person. Inside had some people but for sure it wasn't at all busy.   I would say the food here was a tad bit better than the Mandalay Buffet but still it was just alright. The coffee that was in the mug was quite cold and we had to re order it for the table.   The variety of food is pretty good, I did enjoy the salad bar. I'm more of a salad fan for sure and I'm glad they did have a lot of different options to choose from.   Dessert was plentiful with donuts, pies and crepes. Whatever you fancied you probably could find it here.   Still I felt like it was missing something I just wasn't super satisfied with this choice of buffet. It's average but not spectacular.",

Reasonably priced buffet (for Vegas) with quality food selection, nice ambiance and nice staff. Really the ambiance is the best in Vegas.

Hilarious I wonder how long she dreamed up this magic. But really if you want to eat lite and not pig out, then only select a few of the top choices.

The service at the bar was really poor, needed to wait for the bartender to show up because the guy who replaced him wasn't professional and couldn't do more then to refuel your beer. The crab legs were tasteless and not fresh. Definitely wouldn't recommend this buffet. Pretty sure you can find better place to eat for 90$ for 2 people.",

The nutella crepes for breakfast were AMAZING and my only regret is that I couldn't finish more than one. I also enjoyed their selection of other breakfast items, such as eggs, potatoes and different kinds of sausages. I also didn't mind the self-serve drinks concept because it made it a lot easier to keep my glass filled with what I wanted.   Oh, and if you come here during breakfast, right on the edge of brunch time, they start putting out mimosas that taste divine. So, yeah, come here for the crepes and the mimosas and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I could not finish my Las Vegas trip without experiencing the famous buffet scene in Las Vegas so we tried the Le Village Buffet for brunch. The setting was absolutely gorgeous and felt like sitting in a small french themed village at night. The total cost came out to $33.50 per person which I think is a decent price. The food was good and the unlimited champagne option is definitely attractive. The french dessert options are by far the best reason to come to this buffet. However, the savory options felt quite limiting so i had to stick to one or two dishes that I actually enjoyed. There were a lot of simple breakfast options as well (eggs, bacon, potatoes) which while good for some people seemed to lack creativity for me. The \"sushi\" they had was the farthest thing a sushi lover like myself would consider premium sushi. However, I would highly recommend visiting their crepe station since it was by far the highlight of my visit there!  Atmosphere: 9/10 Food quality: 7/10 Staff: 7/10 (very little interaction necessary) Price: 8/10 (not outrageous) Would I visit again?: No",

The desserts were awful. You would think Paris would have great desserts. Nope. Dry cakes, hard cookies. Let's talk about the salad bar. Yes what bar? It was just iceberg lettuce, field greens and croutons. The toppings were all mixed together. Looked messy. Not appetizing. I gave it two stars simply because of the decor. It's pretty cool. Too bad the food wasn't as good as the interior design. Do NOT recommend this place!",

The crab leg station was full of shells and hardly any crab meat. They do not offer too many options either.   Dessert (mainly my review of the macarons) : Before coming here I was excited for the AYCE macarons. Sadly, they disappointed me. The texture was stale and the taste was almost awful. They offered 4 flavors but I only liked the coffee one. Crepes were additionally offered but I did not get to try them. The other desserts were generic ones you can find at any other vegas buffet.",

I thought the food was good, the selection was good, and the service was fair. All of the food was very familiar in taste. Nothing was crazy interesting but they had quite a few breakfast items that I really thought worked well. The egg selection included everything from scrambled plain, poached, scrambled with veggies in a frittata, build your own omelette, and quiches with meat or spinach. They had all the usual bread products that are on the usual menu. I loved the pecan roll baked with caramel sauce on the side and the crepes were excellent. Mixed berries were super flavorful. They are known for their French baked goods and I have to agree. Great selection and fresh baked. The meat selection had everything from Lox to turkey sausage patties and even some smoked trout. Fresh carved ham and sausage were good eventhough they were somewhat salty to me. We ate all we could and sampled most everything. The only lacking part was our server. Ate my first plate of food and still no beverage service. After my 3rd plate, the first 2 were still sitting on the table waiting to be cleared. Not really a big deal but then neither was my tip. It was not crowded at all and we never had to wait in any lines for food. Overall, I would definitely come here again for breakfast!",

I wanted an egg benedict for breakfast so when I got to the station, the egg benedict looked kind of dry not very enticing, against my judgment, I went ahead it got one.  When I tried to cut the muffin, I couldn't even cut a piece after about ten tries, eventually I gave up, the egg looked very dry, it must have been sitting in the serving pan for who knows how long, mind you this was only 9:30 AM on Monday morning. I have never had an experience like this not be able to cut a piece of muffin ever.  So you tell me how good is this buffet suppose to be? Does it deserve 4 or 5 stars rating? I am talking about egg benedict, your daily American common breakfast, how can they mess up so bad, can't even cut a piece of the muffin after ten tries? Even if I go to IHOP and order a egg benedict I know for sure I can cut the muffin and enjoy my egg benedict.  Base on my egg benedict experience at Le Village Buffet, this restaurant buffet didn't impress me much at all. Otherwise the rest of the common breakfast, scramble eggs and bacons are just like from any regular restaurants.  Oh by the way, the wife got a green apple, took a bite and threw it away. I asked her why? Apple was not even fresh enough and edible.",

    "text": "Ate here this morning upon high recommendation of their crepes. First of all the breakfast was considered brunch on Sunday and was over $30. The service was absolutely the worst. Our waitress for drinks took only half of the tables order and ignored the others (despite all four of us sitting there) so when we got up and approached her to ask for two additional waters she acted put out and said she would bring four. She then proceeded to only bring 3 waters and we had to ask repeatedly for the fourth - which she finally brought at almost the conclusion of our meal and spilled on one of the people in our party. The crepes were tasty but a thirty minute wait in line for a crepe is excessive. It seems like they need more support. All of our other food was completely cold by the time we got the crepes. I really wanted this place to be worth the money after the hype but the service could not have been more disappointing for a place when literally the only thing you need to rely on the server for was beverages.",

We dropped off our bags at Ballys and proceeded to Paris.  Line was short since it was around 10 when we got there.   I LOVE breakfast, it is my favorite meal of the day!!!  For some reason, these chefs knew exactly what my favorites are, as if they were cooking for me!!!  LOL! Bacon - nice and crispy, exactly the way I like em, hashbrowns and red potatoes with herbs and stuff - I just have to get them both.  Eggs, scrambled all fluffy!  I could list more, but EVERYTHING was delicious. I mean EVERYTHING, even the COFFEE was brewed perfect! Not too strong or too weak (for me, sometimes the coffee can make or break the breakfast place)..   What put me over the top was the made to order crepes!  I ordered a crepe with banana and nutella with drizzled with chocolate syrup. Thinking about it makes me salivate. ha ha  I love the decor of the little town!  I think it is so cute!! Our waitress was very attentive. She knew exactly when to check up on us.  I know there are TONS of buffets in Vegas, but I will have to come back to this one.  p.s. dont forget to try the bread and brie (I heard it's the BEST) but I forgot at the time (so I'm writing this now so I won't forget next time).  :)",

    "text": "Oh, Le Village Buffet, you eternal siren!  Even as I was being herded, drunk and full to the brim, into a cab back to my casino, I wanted just one more taste from your table!  And I guess it bears to mention that I'm not one of those people who hates the concept of a buffet and is loathe to lower themselves to dining at one.  Just a heads up because many reviewers make no bones about where they stand on this.  Basically what I'm saying is, if you like buffets, you'll love this one.  First of all, bf and I picked the worst time to show up for Champagne brunch on a Saturday.  We stood in a line that reminded us both of waiting for any given Fantasyland attraction in Disneyland.  That is to say, it was quite long.  But I had a taste for crepes and the menu display on the LCD screen told me this was going to be worth the wait.  And maybe no matter what time you go, there's always a wait for this place.  Oh, was it ever worth it, though!  Succulent prime rib, pork with this chutney sauce that sang to me between bites, crispy bacon, quiche lorraine, and let's not forget the crepes that brought me there in the first place!  Oh, and the champagne?  Endless.  My bf decided it was too dry for his taste, so I downed both our flutes and kept doing so until even I agreed it was time to cut me off.  Eight glasses later, I sailed out of there with a belly full of unique and delicious food, and a love for Le Village Buffet...but a hate for my lack of self control.  I would gladly do battle again!",

The prime rib was unlabeled, but tender.  Non-alcoholic drinks were included and our primary waitress remembered which of us had pineapple-orange juice and which had grapefruit-pineapple.  The crab legs weren't worth the mess and effort - previously frozen?  Another waitress offered to bring us crackers with which to tackle the shells, but never came back with them; same with the wet naps she was asked for.  I found the crepe area right in the beginning, so I had to go back when I was ready for dessert.  My apple caramel crepe was yummy, but I wish they had my primary choices of banana and strawberries.  Chocolate custard and vanilla custard were smooth and creamy.  Desserts were pretty and in share-able portions.  Their creme brulee was preferred to the one at the Monte Carlo.",

    "text": "I had heard this was one of the better breakfast buffets in LV. I don't have anything to compare it to but I thought it was great. It was $27 and it is all you can eat obviously but I just don't know how you could physically eat enough to justify the $27.  They do have SO MUCH to choose from it was a tad overwhelming. Definitely make a trip around just to look before deciding what you want. I went with a nutella crepe and it was fantastic. But who doesn't love nutella!? I also had a few other things that were also tasty. The coffee was not. Get a latte or something at the St. Louis walk up counter. Or better yet, a mimosa. It is Vegas after all! I had to go to a work conference or I would have! We went at 7:30am on a Thursday. We had made reservations but ended up not needing them. Both evenings we were there a line was out the door. So I would suggest making a reservation through Open Table even if you end up not needing it. If you do make a reservation be sure to go to the VIP/special entrance. If you are coming from the rooms it is on the left before the regular entrance. I don't recall my reservation telling me to do this but after we sat down our waitress told us to do that if we came back and there was a line (assuming we had made reservations of course). If I go back to Paris I'm not sure if I'll go again to this particular restaurant because of the cost vs what you can actually eat. They have a creperie where you can get the same crepes and pay about half of what I did.",

I was at the Alsace booth, which had cooked clams and mussels along with other rice dishes. I noticed that one of the dishes didn't have a serving spoon and after a 30 seconds or so of waiting, I had grabbed another to help myself to some mussels. Immediately, the slow-acting and nothing-to-do \"chef\" ripped the spoon out of my hand and yelled at me in a strong French accent.   Two things surprised me: 1) I was genuinely surprised they hired authentic French employees. 2) a $23.99 buffet chef gives that much of a shit  You would think if he felt that strongly about spoons, he would just put one in the tray to begin with. The manager was very quick-acting and great about the whole ordeal. Unfortunately, there are way too many options on the strip to forgive this kind of service. The food was decent but nothing noteworthy.",

Le Village Buffet is THEE spot that my cousins and I would bust a mission to go to when I was little. I have so many good memories of this place and I really wanted to come back here to revisit those pleasant memories... Well... those are nothing more than illusions of grandeur and definitely the failures of romanticizing about the past.   I came here alone for breakfast when my friends were all sleeping and recovering from our nighttime adventures. I remember it was really cheap, about $20-something for the breakfast buffet. The people were very nice and accommodating...   BUT THE FOOD!!!!!   Bleh, the plate I grabbed was so horrible I had to cut up and re-arrange the food on my plate to make it look like I actually touched it so the lady would take it away.   I liked their eggs florentine, the ham the grapefruit, the fruits and the orange juice... but quiche was too oily, the selection of scrambled eggs were disappointing and the steak and potatoes were overcooked. The crepe was \"okay\" but the bananas were too soggy, I just brushed it aside and ate the outside part with the nutella. I didn't even want to eat the breakfast pastries... it was just chocolate croissants, muffins, danish, cinnabuns, etc... nothing special or out of the ordinary...   This experience does not even come close to how AMAZING I remember Le Village Buffet to be... Definitely not worth stuffing my face for :(",

Just sad overall to see a great place go down like this.",

They serve sweet and savory, we picked strawberry-ricotta and banana-strawberry, yummy   I think $22 per person is pretty fair. You can get some eggs with meat and potato, crepes for dessert, coffee, fruits and salads. Seems like same price in regular breakfast place, but here you can also go around and try other desserts, seafood and bakery!  I would definitely come again!",

There is a variety of foods to choose from - from crepes and waffles doused in chocolate and berries to meaty and hearty foods.   I love that they cook and prepare the foods in front of you. It gives you a sense of freshness. I made sure to save room for dessert because the dessert bar is my absolute favorite about this place. You can't go wrong with creme brulees and macaroons.   The waitress we had was the same one I had two years ago in 2014! It's nice to see that there are familiar faces that still work here. She's the sweetest lady ever.   I came here on my last day in Vegas (both times). I would find this place as a good place to go to stuff your face before you leave.",

Hands down the winner is Le Village, because the service is better, the wait is shorter, the price is lower, the dining area is bigger so you do not sit in the lap of the couple at the next table, and finally the food is as good or even better.   You can call me a romantic or something, but I like there is a consistent theme in the buffet. Mission accomplished.",

Sure enough, I had to admit at the end of our brunch that it wasn't anything special. Nothing to write home about. The only thing I remember was good the crepe with blueberries and chocolate. The staff is not very friendly, they all looked grumpy and ignorant. Choose something else for a buffet, this one is not worth it.",

The GRILLED MEAT, along with vegetables were very good, fresh from the grill, with lots of taste.     The MASHED POTATOES were high quality and hands down best Ive ever eaten (and my grandma is a good cook)",

Went twice to Paris (late lunch and breakfast), as we wanted to try the crepes that EVERYONE bragged about. The line to get in both times was long (even middle of the week in August); they're not quick to sit people even though there were alot of empty tables. The crepes were undercooked both times. The woman cooking them in the morning had no idea what she was doing. I've had great crepes and these were just awful. Besides being just bad, there also was no savory options for the crepe fillings. It was all dessert or nothing. I had high hopes for the other dessert offerings and all were blah. The creme brulee was runny. The other pastries were either bland, soft (when should be flaky), or overly sugary. The breakfast items were the same in texture and flavor. Maybe they're cooking for the average American palate? Whatever it was, it really did not impress at all.",

    "text": "This was my second (and unfortunately final) stop on my tour of Buffets that never really happened (I'll elaborate on my review for the Buffet of Buffets).   As all of you know I like to get the negative details out of the way first before I talk about how much I love a place so: The line was ridiculous. Granted, I did go on Christmas day (and I thought by doing this I would actually BEAT the crowd. The reason I went out on Christmas instead of staying home was because I wanted to do something different. I always thought most people still prefer to stay at home during the holidays?), but it's really hard for me to say the wait was worth it if the line is almost 3 hours long and I'm not even exactly hungry anymore. Also, this is quite possibly the worst layout of a buffet I have ever seen. There's no obvious exit, most of the tables are placed way too closely to the buffet stations and there's barely any space to maneuver from station to station in the buffet. I really don't think I have ever felt more claustrophobic.  There, done griping. Anyways this is one of the best buffets I have ever been to. Not gonna lie, when I first looked through the buffet before picking out my food I thought it was going to be disappointing due to the lack of diversity because I'm still kind of under the impression that a buffet is only good if there's loads and loads of international variety. (Unless we're talking about the neighborhood Chinese buffet) I'm accustomed to buffets offering stations for Chinese, Mexican, Sushi, Italian, etc.... so I was really thrown off when I saw this buffet was set up more like a French grocery store. However, once I made myself a plate, I realized that the food was of very good quality. This was basically my introduction to French food, and it's good to see that the legend about French cooking being essentially small pieces of meat swimming in fancy sauces isn't True. There also are some international options if you look (for example, in the grill (or is it rotisserie?) section there's pita bread and hummus next to the beef and lamb slices, so there you go, you can make yourself a gyro). Word of advice: This is definitely not a place to take a vegetarian. I mean, of course the typical buffet is hell for any non-meat eater but other than 2 or 3 big bowls of salad and bread there's pretty much nothing here.   I also fell in love with the crepe section. This was actually my first time having ever eaten a crepe, I've been wanting to try one for a really long time but never seem to get around to it (and it's somewhat hard to find a place that makes them in Vegas to begin with) and it was SO good. I got a strawberry filled one with powdered sugar and caramel syrup on top. I so would have grabbed another one if I didn't mind feeling like a masochist, but alas, I'm getting more self-conscious about my weight these days. Oh well.   So basically this is not a buffet to go to if you're looking for variety in a non-specific sense, but it's a very high quality one regardless, I'll go as far to say it's even better than the Bellagio, and at regular price it's about $15 less. I would go here again just for the crepes. Just remember to get here shortly before or right after each meal has begun and definitely don't go during a really busy time such as a holiday or else you will practically have to get in line on the bridge to Bally's.",

We do the breakfast first and then one lunch sampler and we are done!  The breakfast has different regions of France (american style of course) so you get eggs, potatoes, sausage and bacon made all different ways!  The waitstaff is always attentive and pleasant.  The crepes are pretty fantastic.  We take folks there all the time and everyone is happy.  The lunch has so many different items and all of them are delicious.

I can't find the strawberry covered by chocolate when i made my 2 rounds.  the crepe are too big, like the one from Spice Market more, more crispy there and the banana tastes better.  like other said, the set up is strange, kind of walk around to find your own table especially when you are in a small room, not in the open area",

The crepes and flan were very good, but the creme brulee was burnt (and had only a paper-thin layer of sugar to caramelize) and the other desserts were so-so.",

Several entress didnt even have food lables, so you dont even know what your eating.    Managment obvioullsly can care less, items that appeared empty were never filled.  Employees seemed to be unhappy and moody.   You cant get a hello, or a smile.    Believe me, save your money and go to the flamingo.   There cleaner, cheaper, and offer a better variety.",

It is really nice inside and it is really neat how there are different rooms that are like French style cottages. The food is great and it is very clean which is a surprise especially for a Buffet. The different stations all around the buffet are sectioned for different regions of France. The omelets are delicious as they are prepared right in front of you with what ever ingredient that you choose such as crisp veggies and different types of cheeses. The crapes are prepared the same way, you choose whatever you want in them such as fruit and cream. There are a wide selection of breakfast meats such as sausages, ham, and bacon. There are also waiters in hand to bring drinks (including alcoholic drinks) and assist with anything needed. The brunch buffet is kinda pricey, but is is well worth the money.",

LOL Anyways, the brunch here is OK. Not amazing but average quality. Kind of annoying since a lot of the food was repetitive ex. bacon and eggs (same exact type) like at least if you are going to have it twice have one of turkey bacon or have the eggs with cheese and one without cheese. Eh thats my honest opinion but hey i'm not the boss :( HAHA. Anyhoots, the ambiance seems similar to that of the venetian hotel (clouds painted on the high ceilings) and little village looking themes presented within your surroundings. The waitress are wearing some funny looking outfits, kinda weird if you ask me but hey whatever tickles your pickle I guess? Overall an okay experience.",

    "text": "This has been a crazy 3 weeks for me... going from SF-LV-SF, lots of driving and lots of eating out, so do expect quite a bit of reviews from me in the upcoming weeks on my culinary journey!  This episode features Le Village Buffet in Las Vegas.  Le Village Buffet, located inside Paris Las Vegas, is one of my favorite places to eat.  To set the record straight before we move forward, the food itself is mediocre but the ambiance of the place is absolutely fabulous!    After paying for your buffet fees, you walk into this beautiful french court yard with houses and flowers.  All this is created like a french village under a light blue sky.  I know it's a buffet but it's actually romantic enough to take a date out!  There you can really wine and dine her by picking up all sorts of tasty treats from each of the buffet stations.... isn't that awesome?    I'm not crazy about their pasta dishes so I'll pass on that... but they did have the typical meat sauce, and alfredo sauce pastas, and a pesto cream penne dish.  Along the way I had trial portions of roast chicken, duck, sausage, salmon, roast veggies, stone crabs, and all of them tasted pretty good!  The one dish that really stood out for me was a butter steamed sole...  The fish was curled and wrapped very nicely into the shape of a rose, and steamed to perfection!  Sole itself is already soft and moist and this was just a rose of yumminess!  They came in small pieces like an actual rose so I had about 6 roses of it..... but a totally healthy and tasty dinner for me here for sure!  As for dessert, lots of selections from bread pudding, cookies, cheesecakes, creme brulee, flan, ice cream, fruit tarts, etc.  All pretty tasty especially the creme brulee.... creamy and milky as the dessert melts in your mouth after leaving your spoon..... Just a really good ending to a nice night of buffet experience.  So when you are in town, definitely give this place a try for the ambiance and the food... definitely worth the price!",

Next trip to Vegas tried it, it was bad. Tried it again, bad again. When we get the buffet pass we don't bother with Paris anymore after 2 bad experiences. There is much better food. I say it's a sad place because last June we were walking past when a gentleman was on the floor, EMS was performing CPR but being a medical professional I could tell he was already gone despite their best efforts. I've been to Vegas twice since then but never near that part of Paris, only Bally's.",

I am drooling just thinking about it!  Especially loved the creme brulee! I could've eaten more but we had to leave to get ready for the party. :(  I love the decor. Reminds me of a village in...France? lol. I feel like I am in another time period. TIME WARP!  The costumes they wear are ridiculous and makes them look like peasants. A bit demeaning if you ask me, but whatevs.   Anyhoo, I will be back! Love the variety! And i LOVE the ambiance. Very romantic and I'd suggest anyone on a date to dine here.",

Eggs benedict is good here. I personally went for the breakfast stuffs and crab legs. The desserts are very good here. Drink mimosas until you're ready to go out and start drinking again.

Not knowing that there were so many different rooms that they sat our 3 tables in three separate rooms.  One of the server was so mean.  They were giving us a hard time.  They could of sat us closer, but they wanted to seat one of our group on the other side of the restaurant.

That means lots of mid- to low-quality food that you can shove into your pie-hole before you head off to dump your hard-earned dollars into the machines specifically designed to take advantage of American's poor mathematical abilities.  The coffee was good; everything else was kind of average.  The eggs in particular - can SOMEBODY please teach the kitchen how to cook non-runny scrambled eggs?  I mean, I know they're coming out of a carton somewhere, but at least allow them to set a little before serving them.  They were also very lax on getting the empty stations restocked - there wasn't any smoked salmon out the entire time I was there, and given that it wasn't rush hour or anything that's kind of puzzling.  Highlights were the potatoes (yum) and the chicken sweet potato sausage (weird, but good!)  The servers were unfailingly polite and friendly, but there weren't enough of them to go around, so I ran out of OJ a lot.  I wasn't expecting much, and certainly got it.",

Oh and don't forget if your kids can open their eyes and say bah bah they're in for $19.95 EACH. So with a groupon for me and my wife and a dumb $3.95 bottle of wine which i still have laying around the house somewhere, did i mention my 1 yr old and 3 yr have to pay $19.95 each?...that was only part of the bad experience once in we didn't know what to eat because there's nothing edible to eat. The menu is horrible i tried 5 times to go around the buffet and everytime i will come back to the table with an empty plate no matter how hard i tried, i will pick up one item out of frustation and back to the table, the crepes nothing to brag about i didn't even eat it all tried two different ones both unfortunately had to go to waste the fruit tasted spoiled like it had been sitting out like a week. Thankfully the groupon save me a couple of dollars otherwise i swear i would have somehow someway ask for a refund at the cost.  I feel bad throwing food away that's why i didn't fill up my plate cause i know that's what i would end up doing but for some reason i managed to control my frustation and disappointment but now that i'm back at home i feel like i should have done just that one plate at a time just dump all of it away i would have save hundredths of people the terrible views of the bland, tasteless, old, hard overcooked food. I'm hoping this happen cause it was during christmas holidays and workers were hating everything about work on those days but i'm not going back to find out if that's what it was. Oh no not me not ever stepping back in there and lord have mercy on those who still go there after they read this review.",

Nor did she refill our drinks until we found her and begged for more water and soda. The food selections were ok, but half of the offerings were empty. The wait for a crepe was 25 mins. There were no bowls for the soup or the custard. The layout was bad too. The food stations were crammed together and there are tables of people eating right next to the lines. Waited for mussels. Waited for crepes. Didn't feel like waiting any longer, so no turkey or roast. There seemed to be many employees wandering around. They had no sense of urgency. The line was out the door and around the corner, and there were empty tables everywhere!! Excusable. Now for the highlight of our meal... DESSERT! YUM. Dessert was amazing. Will we go back?

The buffet is pretty large and they have a wide selection for dinner. There's multiple stations, including my favorite, the crepe station! I came here for the dinner buffet at around 3:30pm, so everything was super fresh. The prime rib was super tender and the crab legs were pre-cut and juicy. The crepe station had made-to-order sweet and savory crepes. My bf and I tried the banana and nutella crepe and the blueberry and raspberry crepe; both were AMAZEBALLS! The dessert station had a large selection, including creme brulee, creme caramel, ice creme, and an assortment of macaroons. Our Groupon for the meal included wine; the price for each glass would otherwise be $3 which is quite reasonable.  To better explain why I decided to give this place 5 stars, I had a Groupon that actually expired in July. I stopped by in August to see if they would be willing to honor my Groupon. The manager Steve told me that he would be able to honor my Groupon the next time I was back in town. Today I went to the buffet, asked for Steve, and he allowed me to use my Groupon with no trouble at all. Now that's GREAT customer service!",

I enjoyed their all you can eat Macarons, but wish they has more flavors other than colorful Macarons with a chocolate filling or some Yogurt filling I tried. Definitely get the unlimited mimosas for a few bucks more, our waitress had a heavy hand so we had more champagne and a dash of OJ in our drinks. Didn't get to try their hot crepe station since the line was long.  Bought the photo since they had a special for $20 versus I think it was $30. The photo was taken inside the restaurant after you paid and before we waited in the waiting area. Included a foldable paper frame with Paris border, the name of the buffet one 4x6 and two 3x5 ishhh size.",

There was a line (like always), however it was probably a 20 min wait (not too bad). Our waitress was friendly, but definitely hard to flag down again if you need refills.   The food was a mix of good and average. Crepes were delicious like always (banana and nutella, best combo). The sauteed mushrooms was an item I kept going back for more. Shrimp was decent (make sure your hands are clean since you're doing the peeling). Didn't get the crab legs since they were cold (I like it hot!). They had creme bruelee, but that was so-so. The soft serve ice cream is a must when you're on your way out!  It is definitely a must when I do the Buffet of Buffets, however it's not as glorious as it once was.",

Food is mislabeled or not labeled, the buffet is dirty, and the food staff seem indifferent to the poor conditions. Our waiter is pleasant and is keeping our beverages replenished.  There are no plates at the dessert bar. I asked and the surly attendant told me to get one from the salad bar by pointing.  In the past, this buffet has been my \"go to\" buffet.

I did enjoy their clams the first time, but the second time around I had to bite through some annoying shells. It's affordable compared to the other buffets in the strip. I love their prime rib. One of the features that I love about this buffet was their crepe station. The atmosphere was cute and quaint, perfect for a date. The waiters,  or the ones I had, were very prompt. I give it 4 stars because besides their crepe station, their dessert station was sadly disappointing.",

The dessert section was nice with the creme brulee and flan. They also have a crepe section. Service was good and pleasant. The decor was appealing and Paris like.

I had high expectations about this from all the reviews. However I have to say that I was disappointed with their range of food.  In my opinion, they have strange food and when I walked around to fill up my first plate of food; I struggled to find anything that caught my eye. I guess the type of food that they offer is very french/European and not very mainstream. Also the King Crab legs here are very tinsy winsy compared to some of the more popular places in Vegas. When I spotted another table with larger crab legs that I managed to obtain, I asked my waiter. He replied that they have some kind of high rollers card, and it turns out that Paris only serve larger Crab legs to people who gamble a lot. Go figure!..   I wouldn't dine here again, unless I got the discount coupon that they give when you sign up to be a member of the Casino =)",

If you are brave en ought ask for a large portion and like Prime Rib, then this place might be worth it for you, otherwise not so good.   The crepe bar sounds fantastic, but the server was making them too fast and not letting the fillings heat up, which gave a bad texture and taste to the crepes.   There are other buffets that I would recommend over this one after this trip. MGM brunch comes to mind.",

If you're really interested then just search for Le Village Buffet and it should come up (by the time you read this).  Don't wait in line for the crab legs. Don't get the beef medallions. The seafood is highly mediocre, but the lamb is great. The grilled veggies are fantastic. Get some of of the carrots and cilantro. The brie is, well, brie-elicious. OH, and the sugar-free raspberry tarts are amazing too.  Anyway, 5 stars for variety and value, 3 stars for quality (frankly some of the plates were just not warm enough and too much sauce, unlike good French food), 4 stars for service (we also had some problems getting our drinks).

So tender and savory sweet. The proteins here are generally pretty decent. Glass of $9 red added a nice punch. Especially with the olives and cheeses they had.  I was examining the crab legs when a guy nearby started asking the lady behind the counter about the availability of clams. He had a French accent. A lady joined him at his side and partook in the conversation about the clams (\"klehms\").  So, apparently French fellows eat here. There is surely no higher seal of approval (??). Mixed feelings.

If you want to skip the rest of my blabbering, know this: hands-down, my favorite buffet in the world! Not that I'm a big buffet connoisseur, but I do know the difference between world-class and run-of-the-mill eateries.  Yes, there usually is a line, but it is well worth it. Once they seat you, you are faced with one of the most difficult decisions of the trip...which food station to hit up first?? I recommend the crepe station, but do your best to save room because there's a lot more deliciousness to try. The meats I tried (prime rib, roasted chicken and pork sausage) were tender, savory and tasty enough to eat as a stand alone dish. The scrambled eggs must have had some kind of crack because both my wife and I were thinking of ways to smuggle some out in our pockets. Seriously, DELISH. I also enjoyed the variety of their fresh fruit. The chicken noodle soup was the lone non-plus morsel that touched my mouth. Lastly, the desserts...I'm not a big dessert guy, but I did love their chocolate chip cookies. That's not saying much but my wife (who is a big dessert person) could have had her whole meal be just the desserts!  All this incredible food and I haven't even mentioned the staff. They were all friendly and speedy with their service. Our dirty plates were quickly picked-up and our drinks were never empty. I also have to make a special shout-out to their Chef...Chef Lowell McCain was AMAZING! He answered all of our questions and even took the time to show my pregnant wife the packaging on a variety of their cheeses, to assure her of the pasteurization.  Overall, A+. Can't wait to go back!!",

They had many items but service this time was a notch lower because we were seated in the back where the \"vip\" table was. I'm not even sure if they are VIP, but they seemed to be treated like they were. Table covering, champagne bottles, plates of crab legs brought to them, most of the service was directed towards them.. Booooo!! Hello, we're here too!  Anyway, the food was the same as last time.. but our appetites were smaller as we were in the mindf rame for breakfast-type foods.  Overall, definitely come here because the food is good and the lines are always long, but try to figure out the time frames for breakfast and lunch cut-off so you will pay for breakfast but get lunch too.. or pay for lunch, but get dinner too. =)",

The line was pretty long when we came in, I guess as a result of people trying to take advantage of the breakfast/lunch switchout. We hadn't planned on doing that but it ended up happening anyway!   Your enjoyment of any buffet is contingent upon managing your expectations. For Le Village Buffet, this can be summed up as such: Do not expect French cuisine!   Done.  That being said, the stuffed crepes were by far the star, but I also loved the mini quiches and of course the standard breakfast fare of potatoes, bacon, sausage, etc. The desserts were also plentiful and delicious.",

The pork with apples was amazing, and there was a terrific array of perfectly seasoned vegetables.  I stuffed myself silly with grilled asparagus, sauteed cauliflower, and buttery brussel sprouts.  The dessert of course, to die for.  I liked that there wasn't anything breaded and fried like most casino buffets. The only complaint is the crab legs were soft, brown, and way too salty -- total garbage.  I won't pay this much very often, but for a special treat, it was a great night out.",

    "text": "Wow! This was the first buffet I've ever had in Vegas and it was pretty good! We stood in for about 40 or so minutes Sunday morning to begin our carb load for the Vegas marathon :) If you have a Harrahs playing card, you save $3 - $27. I ate and ate and ate and ate. The crepe station was definitely my fav. I had two, and now that I think about it I should have had 4! Next time! The crepe station is not like the omelet station (which I did not have) but more of a preset menu with no alterations but they are very delicious. The brussel sprouts were soooo good, and the brie mac and cheese with bacon bits -to die-! The prime rib was good but my friend mentioned the turkey and roast beef were dry. Not too many desserts but lots of food! I certainly feel like I did my best to get my monies worth ;) and my friends husband did mention this was the most he's ever seen me eat, lol so I think I did a pretty damn good job. Sausage, french toast, pancakes, brussel sprouts, grilled tomato, asparagus, mash potatoes, quiche, crepes, biscuits/gravy, banana, pretzel roll, champagne, coffee, orange juice. Yea, we really did it up. Not sure if I'll return because I'm not sure I'll ever need to eat this much again in life but certainly worth it for the crepe station alone because I'm sure if you buy them right across the way at the crepe place 27 bucks will get you a few and nothing else. Enjoy! Oh, and expect 98% of the people in there to look as though they eat a \"buffet\" everyday! Just an observation.",

I probalby give more stars than most because we: 1) paid for breakfast price around 10:45 (instead of the double price at lunch just 15 minutes later!) 2) got to skip the line. My husband had the \"diamond\" card which allowed us to use the express line for free. (Well..as he points out...it's not really free since they use those loyalty cards to keep bleeding money out of you through gambling...)  I enjoyed the grilled vegetables (especially the grilled mushrooms!) and mini quiche. The king crab legs were so-so (salty and mushy)...the shrimp was better.  My favorite, however, was the desserts! I enjoyed the creme brulee, caramel flan, passionfruit cake with a layer of what seemed to be passionfruit sorbet(?), flourless chocolate cake...ok...i should be embarassed!!! (I have a sweet tooth! What can I say?)  Bottom line: Go late morning before lunch to save money & make friends with someone who has the Platinum or Diamond card to save time.",

Can't understand the long lines especially when you see all the empty seats inside!  It must be a ploy to make people think that its a popular destination.  The outrageous prices they charge and the mediocre food they serve!  You can spend the $25-$40 at a much nicer restaurant with quality food and service.  They have this buffet around the world deal where you can visit one of seven buffets for a 24-hour period for $39.99 or $34.99 if you have a Harrah's player's card.  Yeek!  Never again will we step into a buffet in Vegas.  Ambience- Cute, small French village is charming. (4 stars)  Food- Old, stale, unsanitary, and bland. (2 stars)  Service- Hit or miss.  We went twice: dinner service absolutely sucked because they stuck us in this room and didn't see the damn waitress.  We also think she was being bitched around by her supervisor that night.  Thus the disappearing act.  Breakfast server was friendly and cordial. (2 stars)  Highlight *The $39.99 deal for 24-hours.  Lowlight *Food *Long lines *Service *Worrying about catching someone's disease",

I went back to tip the crepe makers. They were that good. Carving station. Fresh, good meat served up with a smile. Truffle mac & cheese. Eat it. Desserts. All of them.  The bad: Crab legs. Cold, tasteless, pre-split crab legs not fit for human consumption. Disgusting. Service. It takes a REALLY long time for them to even acknowledge your drink is empty. They also don't take plates very quickly, but the second your entire party stands up to go get food, they're quick to try to turn your table around as if you've left. Plates. It's impossible to find them. They don't seem to put any on the dessert station at all.  In all, a decent place to eat, especially if the casino is comping it. I don't think I'd pay for this buffet, though. Being a diamond member also helps because you can literally walk right in past the line.",

Since I wasn't much of a stew person, the best thing here that stood out for me was the crepe station.

It is a lengthy walk from the strip to this buffet but after gorging ourselves, we were actually happy to walk the distance. We used our total rewards cards to get the discount which really isn't much, but the points are great. After being seated and having our drinks ordered, the 4 of us all went our separate ways in search of our brunches. I for one, like to peruse the entire buffet before settling on items while my husband just grabs the first thing that looks good to him. Because of this, he completely missed the omelette station and didn't even know where it was (odd structure located in the middle of the floor). Another friend of ours immediately got in line for the crepes which was very smart since the line tended to back up. I decided on fresh lox and prime rib hash to start. Both were excellent! I also tried a banana nutella crepe (amazing), eggs benedict (meh), and bacon (duh). The coffee left much to be desired and I found some of the staff to be quite rude but I guess that's to be expected when you're in \"Paris\"? Overall not the best buffet in Vegas, nor the most creative but it got the job done and we would gladly go again.",

I could eat the exact same yummy omelette every morning in a dorm cafeteria, I wouldn't exactly call the omelette at Le Village extra special.  And the rest!?  Scrambled eggs 10 ways.  Whacksauce!!!!!!!  Crepe station....meh.  And don't be fooled into thinking the pastries are just like France either....they are SO not.  That'll be $22.99 for the omelette that I liked.  Oh dear!  I would so rather eat a breakfast sandwich at Earl's.  At least I came at 7:30 and didn't have to wait in the hour line that was formed by the time I finished.  So I didn't exactly pay $22.99, I did the 24 hour buffet pass...And well,  I decided to come back here for lunch to see if it could redeem itself.  Verdict?  The prime rib was good, but the only excellent item was the creme brulee.  Overall, the wait here is way too long and the food is not good enough to make up for it.  Not the complete picture but let's just say breakfast and lunch didn't impress me enough to ever try dinner.  COLLECT  $79.97 (breakfast: 22.99, lunch 23.99, and dinner 32.99) and PASS GO.

The themed rooms represent different regions of France and waiters are dressed accordingly. Service was good. Would deserve 4 stars, but THERE ARE NO French fries... That was disappointing.",

Even the desserts were crap with no flavor and overcooked. We were seated in the corridor of a noisy shopping center so even the ambience was missing. Horrible service never receiving refills probably because they are understaffed. All staff seemed angry. Go for Wynn or Wicked Spoon which was our favorite.",

There was a good variety of food from your standard breakfast food to bratwurst to prime rib to a crepe station. The food is just mediocre about 3 stars. This buffet is not comparable to Bellagio or Wynn buffet. The snow crab legs were tasteless. However, I had to tact on an additional star for service. Our server Wendy was so sweet and attentive. We had a table of nine girls and she never failed to refill our mimosas.",

    "text": "Normally I go to a to fill up on food after working out or not eating, basically looking for quantity and decent quality food.  I don't expect to have a 3 star Michelin experience a buffet or even a 1 star.  In Vegas most of the buffets are decent with the standard prime rib (which is probably \"choice\" and not \"prime\") and other favorites like crab and shrimp.    This was the first time that I've been to Le Village Buffet and will probably make it a place to go when ever I'm in Vegas.  First off, the variety is top notch with a full array of a French menu.    What really surprised me was the braised pork belly with apple and sweet potato.  It was juicy with just enough fat to really add flavor.  And by the way, exercise dieticians state that you need fat in your diet to provide energy for your work outs.    Other things to try are the macaroni in a truffle cream sauce (probably ground truffles or truffle oil), crepes (both savory and sweet) and vegetable side dishes (which I usually avoid since you need to maximize your dollar value).  They had shrimp and crab legs, which I guess can be considered French cuisine, except it was just blanched and served cold.   What was weird was the small section of sushi with a couple of trays of tekka maki and California role.  I guess they wanted to cater a little to the Japanese tourists.  But the ones I saw were eating everything but the sushi.  Now the important part...the desserts!  Creme brulee, flan, macaroons, crepes, frozen custard, bread pudding, fruit tarts and lots of cookies.  Yes, I tried them all.  I don't really like the macaroons, but I had to give them a try.  Still don't like them.  If you want to go to a Vegas buffet, go directly to Paris.  In my opinion its the best on the strip!",

Over the years they have significantly cut costs, so the food isn't the same quality as if once was. They've also changed the Crepe station one too many times. Less options to choose from, cheaper sauces used, less meat, lack of quality, etc. Meanwhile, carving station meats are mostly overdone, tough, and under seasoned. Pastas taste like they were initially frozen and made me feel nauseous after eating. I could go on, but long story short the best time to come is breakfast. Omelette station is good and most of the breakfast items are a hit. Other than that I wouldn't come back for lunch or dinner.",

After waiting what seemed like forever to pay (quite literally, even the manager could not understand why the line was so backed up for so long), we were finally seated. I wish I could say that our experience got better after that but it didn't. It took about ten minutes for our waiter to show up with utensils and drinks. He seemed really discombobulated as he had forgotten his pen and paper in the back and had to attempt to memorize our drink order. Once we received our drinks, he basically disappeared forever AKA we had to bus our own dishes when the table started to overflow with plates (we eat a lot) and spent most of the meal with empty water/soda glasses even though he had come over and had promised to return with refills.   Other than the help, the food was pretty good. For the price (30 pp for dinner), it isn't really worth it. The variety is lacking, although there are plenty of the usual meat and potato type foods. I feel as if my expectations were much higher than what I actually received. Probably won't be returning.",

    "text": "As a disclaimer, this is the only buffet we visited in Vegas, so I can't offer any advice as to how this buffet may stack up to other buffets. We picked Le Village because we had seen it the day before when we were inside the Paris Hotel & Casino. Also, by the time we walked down The Strip and were near Paris, we were pretty hungry, so it was a good place to stop for lunch, given that some of the other buffets would have been a longer walk.   We went for lunch, which was $24.99/person, not including tip. I am not sure what other Vegas buffets offer, but overhearing one table over, they were surprised that this buffet did not include a glass of wine. Soda and soft drinks were included (Pepsi products). At lunchtime the buffet wasn't that crowded and we were seated at a table in the main section near the dessert area. Our waitress was friendly and did a good job of keeping up with clearing plates.   The buffet had the usual staples - shrimp, a carving station with prime rib, ham, and turkey. They also had an extensive salad bar area that also contained various types of soups and fresh fruit. One of my favorite dishes was truffle pasta. There also was roasted chicken that was quite tasty that I went back for on one of my many trips back up to the buffet after my friend recommended it.  I enjoyed the crepe station that the buffet had and got a delicious strawberry and nutella crepe. The menu also had other interesting crepe flavor combinations that looked good as well. One of my favorite desserts were the macarons and there were plenty of flavors to pick from.   Overall, we were beyond full after dining at the buffet and I thought the selection was pretty decent and the quality of the food was good.",

Half the items had no name plate to tell you what the item was.   There was saran wrap tied to the buffet and then to two stanchions used as a rope. The name plates around the buffet all had years for grime and food particles around them.  The ones that did have a name plate on it, the plate couldnt go in all the way due to food being stuck in the crevice.  When I told the guy at the bakery the name played were on the wrong items...ie. carrot cake on chocolate cake. He came out and just removed them and complained he doesnt have time for this  instead of just switch them. If you look at the top glass on bakery display....it looks frosted. I assure u it is not frosted glass but years of dirty....see pic. The whole place was filthy. I spoke with manager and he didnt want to walk through with me to see all the areas and just wanted to comp me a buffet.  Why would I eat here again. I am already taking a serious food borne illness chance as it it.  I gave the comp to my parents and then upped their life insurance to 5 million.  When I went to wash my hands an employee came out of the toilet and walked right out past the sink that a customer was using.  I can only pray that he washed his hands in the back kitchen but being he tied his apron, I can only pray again.  I tried to go make contact with hotel management but no luck there on a Saturday.  If this is the way they treat the most visible part of the restaurant then who knows what systemic issues are in the kitchen.  Oh our server was great.",

    "text": "Breakfast: a basic buffet, not worth the money and bad service  Thankfully we used a Groupon for this buffet so didn't pay full price and got unlimited drinks  The waitress mist have hearing problems, or just didn't care, we asked for water and she started at us for a moment so my husband and I repeated \"waters\" - a min later she returned with 1 water for 2 people - -Um.. okay? Coffee was on the table but no cream, and she never offered or asked to vring some. I noticed the tables around us had similar problems not getting water, cream and having to ask for things more than once. The food, again pretty basic. Lots of different types of eggs and pastrys  Crepes made to order where good although the strawberrieswere cold, my husband's strawberries were still half frozen. Overall if you're willing to spend the money go somewhere else. If you want a basic buffet don't waste you're money.",

We arrived at 2 pm on Sunday and almost every item was either gone or picked over like it was  a Venezuelan grocery store. They were in no hurry to bring out anything fresh either. The staff could have cared less too.  If you're going to spend this much money for a buffet .. go to Aria! We've never been disappointed there .",

The omelet was perfectly cooked, the slab bacon was juicy and flavorful, and both the corned beef and chorizo hashes were fantastic. Actually one of the best corned beef hashes I've ever had. They have a huge variety of sweet options too if that's your thing.   At 25 dollars for the breakfast buffet, it seems pretty average price for the Strip, and is well worth it in my opinion.  No really, try the corned beef hash.",

The crab legs were cut then frozen so they are very dry, salad bar had very few extras, macarons which should be their forte disappointed, far too many people near me did not eat the roast beef, etc. So very sad as this used to be one of my highlights of Vegas.  My opinion is not alone as there used to be a line but it was only 75% full tonight.    The custard machine was great. Pairs well with the bananas foster.",

And they had prime rib (crab legs, Japanese seafood, chicken, turkey, pork loin), however, I only eat meat cooked completely cooked through...   I was content with the cooked vegetarian sides (eggs, dinner roll, corn, brusselsprouts, mash potatoes, mushrooms, haricots, gingered carrots, purple cauliflower, hb eggs) and desserts (banana macaroon, carrot square, creme brulee, ricotta cup). I really did enjoy the dinner buffet. My waitress was upset that I was single and choose to eat meatless. She offered me mimosas, but I drank earlier at Bally's. Not to worry, I took some tea to drink later.   Excellent buffet coupled with great customer service.",

The wait was not terrible (15min).. we were seated in one of the little rooms set up as dining room, with several small tables   Food options are not repeated so you should walk around first so you're making good choices .. everything is labeled and all the serving trays were full..  the roast beef and savory crepe stations are a must.. plenty of protein options duck, salmon, roast beef, prime rib, crusted fish, chicken, crab legs, shrimp, sausage.. seafood paella  lots of veggie options roasted root veggies, corn, mushrooms, roasted carrots, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts and of course a full salad bar  Must try one of the dessert crepes being made to order .. on today's visit they had the banana Nutella crepe and berry crepe (don't forget to tip the chef!) both were amazing!!   It's a serve your own beverage kind of place, not my favorite .. the coffee cups are small so you're walking around with a mini coffee cup trying not to burn your hand and get as much of it in the cup back to your table  It's a buffet so hit and miss on some items .. bread was hard.. they bus tables only so don't expect any table service and it's busy.. the macaroons were put together inside to topside instead of inside surface to inside surface..",

Only offered two different types of crepes - wish they had more options. The gentlemen working at the crepe station was amazing though! Very nice man  The ambience was so nice!

But while we were staying at Paris Casino, we felt like we should try Le Village Buffet since it seemed nice, with French food from various regions of the country. Sounds like fun, right?  Nothing I tasted reminded me of anything I had in France, everything seemed bland, overpriced. After a while you get tired of keep trying mediocre food hoping that the cuisine from a certain region is better executed. Not!  On top, the place was noisy with kids running around and screaming. So much for that classy atmosphere!",

The sushi broke apart way to easily and impossible to grab with tongs.  Steer clear as it was not a popular dish and just sitting out the whole time.   The crab legs were thin,  shelly and not worth the effort for so little reward.  The residue from the cracked shells would be on the crab meat and left an extra grainy texture. Apparently,  if you have platinum status they will heat the cold crab legs and offer it by the plateful.  I'm guessing the appeal is having French cuisine all in one place. The crepe station,  macarons,  creme brulee, all basic and just so-so. None of the cooked dishes were memorable. $30 something for dinner, but on a positive note,  the leek potato soup was comforting for a chilly restaurant.",

If you're not a huge seafood lover, it would be safe to say that this buffet isn't for you(and to be honest, if you are a seafood lover, I still don't know if this is the buffet for you). For $30 or so a person for lunch, we didn't have much to choose from, and what we did get on our plates, wasn't amazing by any means.   On a Thursday in February, the line was nonexistent, so that was a plus. We walked right in. Our waitress was nice enough and cleared the plates and refilled the drinks. The building was beautiful and I loved that!   Lots of pasta type dishes.   Lots of veggies.   Not a lot of meats to choose from.   My roll was great!   I'm really grasping f straws here people.   The food we ate wasn't gross, but besides the Mac and cheese, nothing from my first plate got a round two for my second plate, which isn't the norm for me at buffets.   We might go back if we got free vouchers for sitting in a timeshare presentation or something... we wouldn't pay to eat here again though.",

This may be even a distinguishing factor from some other Las Vegas buffets that seem to collect positive reviews about dinner time, and often negative ones about the lunch.   Food is very tasty, especially meat.  On the negative side, a very long waiting to get a table and not necessarily because of many people. Just a very slow service. A lady comes and takes a party to a table and explains about the stuff around the buffet, in 2-3 minutes comes back for the next party.. A man in front of me even started to openly complain about this using a colorful language, which sped up things only a little.",

Their dessert bar was great, with lemon tarts, chocolate shell tarts, cheesecake, and many pies and cookies. We had a group of 5 and got seated in a really quaint quiet room so that was nice. Our server also brought over a plate of crab legs which was a nice gesture.   Cons: Nothing much about this place except the lack of seafood. And the fish I ate had bones in it which I ended up swallowing since it wasn't expected.",

I should have known the quality, when I saw very small lines formed, when it is normally, should be a busy hour.  Like a previous reviewer on the YELP, the cashiers were not happy to be there.  Kind of like, \" Okay, who is next\"  kinda of vibe from one of them. (there are two cashiers).  Foods were just okay, but Prime Rib was so dried that it was close to a Beef Jerky level.   Most of the foods were kind of mediocre, few thing that stand out were.  Crapes and Macaroons  other than that, I am not sure I will pay $32 to have this food again.   Will I revisit this place again.  Well, Probably not anytime soon.  I would pay extra and go some other places.",

I liked the selection and variety they had (fruits, eggs, sausages, bacon, omeletes, bagels, pastries, potatoes, biscuits, smoked salmon, yogurt, ice cream in chocolate covered cones w/ almond sprinkles etc). The handmade crepe was good, even though the fruit inside kept falling out. The pastries didn't look very appetizing, and the ones that were did not taste very good. Nice staff. The juice and coffee kept coming. Plates were cleared quickly. Cute decor. Great atmosphere. Feels like evening. Food was nothing special compared to other places on the strip, though.",

    "text": "Works in a pinch. If you are staying at the Paris casino, or find yourself with feet tired of walking up and down the strip all day, this buffet will get the job done.  However, if you have the time and energy, I recommend checking out one of the other buffets on the strip such as Wynn or Bellagio.  We had the Buffet of Buffets pass, so we could go to 8 buffets in 24 hours that are all part of the Harrah's casino chain.  (No we didn't make it to all 8, but oh did we try!)  Le Village is the little brother of buffets on the strip, with more limited offerings and a smaller seating area.    The wait wasn't too bad, so if you hate lines you might have a better chance of getting in quick here.  Although I have generally found that the longer the line the better the buffet!  When we were seated and started our multiple rounds of plate filling and emptying I found that a lot of the stations were slow to re-stock.  It was about 8:00, and they close at 10:00, so I think they stopped replacing the food in order to reduce throw-away.  Makes sense, but still disappointing since I am not one of those people who come back from the the buffet counters with the leaning tower of food stuffs on my plate.  By the time I went to get some of the dishes, it was only to find that they had run out.  Going off the assumption that Paris is a French place, and Le Village sounded distinctly French, I planned to go directly to the foods that were hard to pronounce expecting to be wowed by something more unique than the standard Prime Rib that all buffets have.    Ratatouille - Not bad for a vegetarian dish.  It had a little spice and heat to it which made it very flavorful.  Since my only prior experience with Ratatouille was the mouse movie I was pleasantly surprised.  Crepes - Yes, everyone has crepes these days, but they are admittedly very good here!  The crepe chef wasn't French, but I will give them a pass on that one.  Chateaubriant sauce - This French sounding sauce goes with the non-French sounding beef tri-tip and was absolutely amazing.  Viva le fusion!  French Onion Soup - It is right there in the name everyone.  However I have had much better at local restaurants here in LA.  And since it is buffet style, it was missing the cheese covered topping on the bowl that I associate and love with this dish.  Sauteed Mushrooms - A very simple dish and pretty universal, but they used some amazing marinade that really kicked it up a notch.  I made two trips for these guys before they ran out and never re-stocked them.  Crab - A staple in all great buffets, was practically non-existent.  Don't go here if you are looking for great seafood in general.  The rest of the food was either at or below par with other buffets, so nothing to really comment on.  To re-iterate my initial assessment, this place will work in a pinch, but if you have the time and energy, try one of the bigger buffets on the strip and eat up!",

Even the center part,which is usually less flavorful and dry, is just as good as the coveted outside portion.  They didn't cut slices but pieces for you.  At first, I was a bit offended to receive a chunk of prime rib rather than a slice.  Then i realized it didn't matter which part you got.    I got 4 of their creme brulees.  I don't know which other buffets have them so I kept going back.    They also have lamb if you like that.  Their tri tip was a bit dry.  I like their cookies as well.

If you are a lover of crepes which they also sell outside, I prefer you to come here. As for the food, kinda shitty. They basically had veggies cooked in three ways in each section. Also serving mashed potatoes, overly heavy pasta, turkey and prime rib which I didn't have. Horrible selection of sushi and fruit. Sushi rolls seemed like raw white urchins. Fruit was in a dressing pot which only had melon, pineapple, and melon. So you get my point. Dessert was basically cookies, brownies, \"cakes\", just like at any other $10 buffet. Later they started serving macaroons. Personally, I don't like them and trying one made me want to spit the calories back out. So please, if you come here.... Eat two or three crepes and it will be worth it. (Custom or the flavors are on the wall)",

Tons of choices and the crepe station is amazing, plus they are huge!  Staff was courteous and responsive, and we were seated immediately. In fact, we were celebrating my sons birthday and didnt tell the staff, so we started singing happy birthday to him and our server was right by our table and came up and joined in!  I loved the atmosphere and the way its made to look like a quaint village in France was out of a fairy tale.  We had a couple picky eaters in our group and everyone found something they loved and then some!  For those complaining about having to run a maze to get back to your table, etc. sounds like you need to go to a regular restaurant where someone will cater to your every need and want, not a buffet, no matter how nice it is because you do have to walk around and get your food!",

The line wasn't long at all and they had everything from your standard breakfast with eggs and bacon and biscuits and gravy to greek food and even some crab legs but they weren't monstrous. Additionally, this place has a crepe station and they had a menu with sweet and savory crepes to pick from. I also enjoyed the roast beef and the real slabs of bacon they had. Additionally with the buffet you get unlimited mimosa and they constantly refill it.",

The only pro is the crepe station until some random person cuts in because they know someone at the front.  Overall  it's not worth it, food is subpar, go to Aria instead.",

If it weren't for the Buffet of Buffets 24 hour pass, I'd be seriously angry.  We waited over an hour to eat lunch and when we got in, the food was anything BUT French.  I've been to Paris and they've done a nice little job decorating the place but the food was terrible.  I can usually tell how good a buffet is by my desire to return to get seconds.  Well, after my first run through, I wasn't excited whatsoever.  I ended up stuffing myself on crab legs that weren't cracked and on shrimp that were partially peeled.  I recall Paris having awesome desserts.  When I got there, I saw flan and was excited to get that for dessert but they stopped serving it!  OMG, how can they stop serving flan?!  Not to mention, they didn't even have creme brulee like they did in the past.  Half the dessert weren't even French and the lady working at the dessert station threatened me because I took too many fruits, saying I can't take them out because they have security at the door.  That statement is laughable in so many ways.  First of all, I took the fruit because there were nothing to eat and way to be presumptuous!  And security to check to make sure we weren't smuggling fruits out of the buffet? LOL!!  I'm sure they'd really pay someone money to stand at the exit to pat people down before they left.  C'mon!  Oh and the crepes station?  OVERRATED!  It's nothing like the real thing, trust me.",

    "text": "Ah, Buffets... When you're in Vegas, it's a staple that you simply have to go to a buffet and stuff your face with over load amount of food for a prefixed (roughly $30) plate.   To be honest, the price of food in Vegas is so cheap that it doesn't really make sense to go to many buffets. You're just indulging yourself with more sin. And this is coming from someone who is an atheist. It's just not all that healthy and I haven't had a post-buffet experience where I said to myself  \"You know, I don't regret eating all that.\"   No, it's usually \"Why the fuck did I eat all that god damn food?\" and followed by me being of no use to anyone for a couple of hours as I recover from a food coma as well as just not wanting to do much activities.. and given that this is Vegas, that's a tragic tragic thing.   This buffet has a quaint look and feel to it. Of course being in Paris it has a certain Beauty and the beast feel to it. In fact I was wondering when Gaston to show up and brag about how much he won in the nickle slots.   The buffet is sectioned off. Was stuck in some little fake make shift house. Way to kill my line of sight to the fake blue sky painted above, Buffet wait staff! As for the food selection - There was some decent stations. The carving station seems to be my favorite. There's something magical and fresh feeling with getting meat sliced off a whole shank.  The fruit selection was pretty dismal. The dessert selection, while good, I was a little underwhelmed. You're themed after a french continental location, I'm sure Remy the rat could make better dessert options. Maybe he was too busy making some of that thrown together sushi.    The fish station has shrimp and crab legs. Some staples I was proud of. Over all, it's a good spot for a meal, but my adverse feelings towards buffets as a whole just doesn't allow me to rank it more than an A-Okay.",

I had crepes, various meats, including a fantastic prime rib, mac and cheese, and chocolate croissants done closer to French style than American style. The service was excellent.  The chocolate croissants would probably have been better earlier in the day since by the time we showed up they were a bit old, but still tastey.  Would definitely go back.  Well worth the price, especially if you get it as some sort of deal.  I have spent more money on food with much poorer quality.",

Granted we only visited one other on the list, Carnival World Buffet, but it was enough for us to notice if we wanted food w/ good flavor that Le Village Buffet was where it was at.  It is one of the smaller buffet's I've been to but they offer a lot of dishes of french cuisine that you can't find in any other buffets. Their prime rib was perfectly cooked and juicy. I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious. I loved that some of the things were simple little dishes, but packed with great flavor.   They do have a crepe station! They can make them with any fruits and toppings they have on hand for you and they're all so delicious. If you come for breakfast/brunch they do have an omelette station and offer unlimited small bottles of Korbel champagne.  The wait staff and service is slow. We came on a Saturday night and after being seated it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks. I was wondering what was taking so long and noticed it was only one guy taking drink orders and serving them on our side of the buffet. They are extremely over worked.  Their creme brulee was the best ending to a delicious meal. A second creme brulee was even better ;)",

Yes they have these, but at Le Village you get a more specialized dining experience different cheeses, pates, and their desserts and french pastries all unique items  3. Champagne Brunch! all you can drink, make some mimosas   dislikes: 1. Well waiting in line does suck, but it's inevitable at any decent vegas buffet",

However, we found out if you are willing to pay 10 bucks on top of the original set price, you can get in at a shorter line.   I am amazed at the amount of choices you can get here. Be forewarned, this is my first time to Vegas so this buffet was like a food high for me. It took me about 5 minutes to figure out what I wanted to start with and ended up with french toast, sausage, eggs, and a crepe. While my eggs weren't all that great, everything was pretty good. To top off my amazing breakfast, we were served champagne! After my several glasses of champagne and coffee, I ended up with some dessert.    Even though they have just about anything you can think of from crab legs to salad, I couldn't bring myself to eat that for breakfast.   Oh, the champagne actually went well with my food. Whenever our glasses became empty they were promptly refilled. Service was friendly and efficient even though it was jam packed in the restaurant.  I see people criticizing the place for not being a real french buffet, nonsense! It's good enough for me! I believe we paid about $43.00 a person without tip but I tried my best to get my monies worth.",

The reoccurring theme was dry: pork, roast beef, tri-tip, duck -- all dry, and scarily enough, all tasted vaguely the same! Prime rib looked way better than it tasted.  Run away from the truffle macaroni-- it is evil incarnate and stunk like funky garbage. Totally pungent nastiness.  The majority of other items I tried tasted uninspired, as if cooked with total apathy--like tone deaf cooking. Sauces were questionable and bland. Coq au Vin sauce  tasted like vinegar, not \"vin\"!!  1 star for the service-- staff were friendly and helpful, which I certainly appreciate. Also, the crepes and crab were good, but its pretty hard to screw that up, right?  Yes, the village ambiance is quaint and cute, but without decent food to back it up, it's just a gimmick.  Not worth the cost AT ALL. Will I be back?  Absolument pas!",

Only downside is that on Saturdays you have to wait in a pretty long line if you come around prime brunch time (~after 11am), but while you wait you can always stare up at the \"sky\" ceiling and admire the fake French neighborhood around you.",

Everything had flavor, and there were a lot of different food items that you don't always see at a buffet.  My one recommendation is to go early, because if you're like me and you go at around 12:30 pm, expect an hour wait.  Still, even our 2 kids (aged 10 and 15) thought that the buffet was worth the wait, and that's saying something coming from impatient kids.",

Paris buffet is probably my 3rd avorite buffet to go to after bellagio (first) and planet hollywood (2nd).   25.99 for dinner on a friday night. long wait. but it was all worth it.   We got seated and waited forever to get someone to take our drink order. My boyfriend was excited that the drink was included. So he ordered a water, iced tea and a sprite. For some reason, the server gave us attitude, \"3 drinks for one guy?\". Dude Lady, we paid for drink included and we're getting our freakin moneys worth! I'm all about customer service, but she was just rude and dissrespectful.   My favorite items are OF course: Shrimp Cocktail  CRAB LEGS! with lots of clarified butter!!!!!!! Bouillabaise (seafood soup. i love the potato balls!)  Cheeses!!!!  Creme Brulee  Straight up, delcious buffet. Good Eats for a good price.   Awesome array of desserts but not as good as bellagio's or spice market.   A MUST!!!!!!!",

The line I saw was ususally really long but on the Sunday afternoon we came it was only about 15 minutes.  The decor was adorable and didn't look like a trashy buffet place at all, in fact it looked like a little parisian village!  The fruits, vegetables, cheeses, and seafood was surpsingly fresh and plentiful.  There were a lot of pastas and heavy things that I wasn't that into but still delicious.  Best part was the desserts of course, since it is France!  Try the pot de creme, the creme brulee, and the cannolis.  Although it was a good buffet, it probably wasn't worth the 800 I lost before! Most expensive meal of my life!",

I don't think the guy cooked my omelette enough since it wound up being a little runny.  Oh well, the made to order crepes (which are HUGE!!!!!) more than made up for it!

We did see our server a couple of times for drinks, but were unimpressed by her \"what do you want\" manner.  Food was mediocore and bland.  Reminded me of Hometown Buffet.  Le Village's saving grace was its prime rib, which was juicy, tender and flavorful.  They also had creme brulee, yum yum.  We came towards the end of lunch time, which may have contributed to the poor quality of food.  The dinner items, which included king crab legs and salmon, definitely looked better.",

Not only that the table next to us wasn't cleared and it wasn't pleasant sitting next to an empty, dirty, table. Not to mention we had to ask 2 people to bring us new silverware because my bf dropped his knife ;[ And it took them a while to pick up our dirty dishes, so that when I came back from getting more food there was still a dirty dish there at the table D:  Other than that the food was delicious! I loved the selection, breakfast, lunch, dessert, sweets, veggies, seafood. All you could ask for, and they served champagne, super fancy! x3  I know this doesn't really matter when it comes to rating restaurants but when in line for the first time I ended up behind this really stuck up person! I assumed she was just upset about something and told myself to calm down, but what really pissed me off was when one of her friends came up to her and started a convo (which I didn't really mind I mean w/e, theres plenty of food and making a big deal out of cutting is kind of childish) and the person in front of me said, \"Yeah I don't see anyone with fruits\" and she turned around, locked eyes with me, looked me up and down, and turned around all stuck up like!! The second I saw a break in the line I jumped ahead and got my self away from that pile of bad ju-ju. Yuck! Dx  What evs, I enjoyed myself and I really liked the buffet :3",

The refillable champagne and orange juice to make a Mimosa is a big plus. Best of all, I enjoyed the Omelette or Omelete prepared by one of the chefs there. I forgot his name but as soon as I remember, I will post it as he is worth mentioning here based on his fine way to cook that omelette, compared to the other chefs there. It was so delicious, I went to him twice. The rest of the food is good. I like the smoked salmon sashimi slices, and the bacon most of all. The only down fall is that they overcook the prime rib and other meats there. The waitresses and waiters are nice but can get very busy at times and you sometimes have to track them down to get a refill or any other request. I can't say more about this place as other have already mentioned them in their reviews, both good and bad, but I like this buffet and find it worth it especially if you buy the 24 hour pass that allows you to eat at any of the hotel chain's buffets for a 24 hour period since time of purchase.",

First of all the line was INSANE!  We showed up at 11:30am... which okay I'll admit that is probably prime time for brunch but that line was not moving.  Luckily if you go to the Diamond club entrance they let you pay $10 per person to cut in front of the line.  Paying the $10 is well worth it.  However I do have a warning to give.  The staff in there is super RUDE! I don't know if everyone in there was having a bad day or if they were just trying to be in character, but they wouldn't make arrangements for us to sit with the rest of our party ( who paid separately) and the hostess practically left us behind making it hard to follow her.  Our drink server was nice but forgetful.  However, they did keep the bubbly coming and always made sure my glass was full :)  The food was pretty okay.  Some of the meats were dry but the pasta selection was pretty good.  The Crepe station was nice- I got nutella with bananas and strawberries- it pretty much rocked!  But the dessert selection was so so.  I was a bit disappointed with the dessert and on top of that nothing was labeled.  So if there wasn't anyone there to answer your questions about  which dessert was which, you had to pretty much guess what you were about to eat.",

This time around, everything was just the opposite. What had happened? Are we playing roulette with the quality of Vegas buffets now?   Since it was breakfast, and we weren't big eaters during the early morning, I was resigned to the fact that the food would just have to suffice. We always received friendly and efficient service in the past. This time around, we found ourselves stuck with strange and grouchy service. I was at the crepes station and asked for strawberries. The lady behind the counter snapped back, \"we don't have strawberries!\" Oooh kay... I guess someone woke up on the wrong side the bed.  Back at the table, we asked our waitress for orange juice, but a few minutes later she came back saying they were all out and offered grapefruit juice instead. Huh? A breakfast buffet out of OJ at 9 am? We thought that was strange, to say the least. Sure enough, tables all around us received tall glasses of OJ. The funniest thing is, we see people throwing away empty boxes of juice from the market. Why, of course.",

There are different stations, like any buffet, where you can get different kinds of food, most of it European. I tried really hard to like the food. Not much of it looked appetizing. Even less of it tasted that way.   Shrimp and crab legs are my go-to items for Las Vegas buffets. They're usually safe, right? Well, the crab legs were cold, not hot. The melted butter was barely lukewarm, so by the time you walked back to your table with it, it was congealing. Still, I could make do with the crab legs, but that's not much of a buffet, is it? The absolute worst part for me was the shrimp. I dipped it in butter, bit down, and CRUNCH. What the hell kind of lazy-ass place doesn't de-shell the shrimp before serving it? Plus, if it's not de-shelled, then it's certainly not de-veined! Crunchy, poop-filled shrimp should not be on anyone's list of things to eat while in Las Vegas. If you want real seafood (and variety) at a reasonable price, go to the buffet at Harrah's.",

They had everything from fresh crab legs to a vegetarian bar (which, although I am not a vegetarian, had a great selection!) The prime rib was five star for a buffet style restaurant.   The minor reasons I gave this buffet a 4 and not a 5 was for the following reasons; There was a severe lack of claw crackers or tiny forks for the crab legs/claws, which just seems sadistic given the freshness of the meat. They appeared to be seating 'non-diamond' customers in a separate room, alway from the actual buffet. I don't have a problem with preferred customers getting faster seats or discounts, I just felt like I was in some sort of containment camp for poor people. And the sushi was just average, if your going to serve sushi, serve it right. The rolls were boring (cucumber & california) and I couldn't find a small cup or dish for soy sauce, which means I would just have to pour it over the rolls and that is just wrong!  All in all that is a great buffet for the money, and really spices up the standard buffet selection. Last but not least, save room for desert! The desert section is more impressive than some restaurants have, only time I've ever done seconds on a buffet dessert table.",

Unlike all the other buffets in Vegas, it tries to hold a French theme, but it is weird that it does have sushi in one of its houses.   I really liked the meat station here and it was pretty damn good. Also, for some vegetarians, you might be able to find some stuff that you can eat like buttered potatoes or ratatouille.   The best part of this buffet is definitely the desserts! There is a little hut in the middle that offers french macarons! OMG. how i love french macarons. They taste SO FLUFFY that i'm going to die.. from its awesomeness! :)   I thought it was a great deal coming here during dinner, they also have a gryos section. The only thing that I didn't like here was that the women's restroom was only one stall by the gyros section. Thank god there wasn't a huge line.   One thing that I highly recommend is sign up for the Total Rewards Card at any of the Harrah's properties and get the 24 hour buffet pass for 34.99 + tax.

For thirty-something dollars per person, I could've gotten a better meal elsewhere.  I used to like this place because they had some pretty high-quality and tasty dishes but during this last visit, everything seemed to have gone downhill.  Maybe it's due to the economy but you can definitely tell that quality has been sacrificed.  The meat you get from the carving table was dry and tough.  Presentation of dishes were a mess since food was strewn all over the place and nobody seemed to care about cleaning the little messes.  Oh and the crab.... Such horror...  I didn't even dare to touch it because they were gray in color and looked like they've been refrozen multiple times.  Such a shame because this used to be one of my favorite buffets.",

    "text": "Vegas buffets.  The Le Village buffet is my favorite in Vegas!  I've been to the buffet at the Luxor, MGM, Rio, Wynn, TI, Bellagio, Flamingo, and Ceasar's Palace, and definitely over the years, new ones have popped up, and chefs change, but Le Village has always done it for me.  I enjoy the Paris setting in general, the light blue, cloudy sky ceilings make me feel like and happy as i sit and enjoy my meal.  I feel like the extensive selection of various foods from all across the world is better here that a lot of other places, too.  I think what really does it for me is that I feel like the desserts selection is so good!  I know a lot of people where desserts is not a big deal, but for me and my and big sweet tooth, this selection was great and exactly what I wanted!  Disclaimer: I do have a Diamond Players card, so the wait time is irrelevant since I never have to wait in the normal line with everybody else, so you do need to prepare to sit in line for some time if you come here during a peak hour.",

Every time I am in Vegas, I'm sure to stop by the Paris buffet. It's my all time fav. buffet because the food is pur LUX. You feel like your body is getting fed. This food isn't this processed crap we eat all day.  I love the variety; the atmosphere; the service, and the FOOD!  I totally recommend the duck l'orange. It's my fav. item on the menu.  The wait is long... 15 - 35 minutes.  But this buffet is SOOOOO worth it.   It's been ages since I've been to Vegas... hmmm, maybe I should take my boyfriend for a weekend trip - - just so I can eat here!   A++",

The bagels, the english muffins used in the eggs benedict, and even the potato triangles (hash browns) were all so hard that they either crumbled or you couldn't cut through them.  The scrambled eggs were watery and the lox were presented on a plate where half looked a few days old and the other half looked somewhat fresh. How does a big hotel like this justify the poor food quality?  You're better off leaving the hotel and going to a real breakfast restaurant, and you probably won't have to wait to get uninspired, and in some cases inedible food.  Big disappointment.",

We made it suffice for 3 meals!  Paris buffet was the second we went to - the wait in line was okay, but as a few of us girls were on a time restraint to make it to Tao so we only got to eat for like 15-20 minutes once we got seated. It wasn't much of a problem as we were all not too hungry having had Caesars Palace buffet earlier for lunch.  It's pretty cute that the employees are dressed up in accordance to the theme of the restaurant. The variety of food was quite large, and even had it's own \"dessert shack\", as my friend described it. Sure enough, it was it's own little structure in the middle of the buffet!  I'd definitely like to try to get a FULL experience of this buffet again the next time I go to Vegas.",

I can't say this was my most enjoyable experience given I did go on a major holiday and got taken by paying $27.99/person for lunch.   Trying to get the amount I paid off my mind, I hit up the seafood for the crab claws and shrimp cocktail. Ever since I became addicted to Deadliest Catch, I opted not to eat the crab legs because the meat was puny compared to the claws.   Could not pass up the prime rib they cut to order along with a made-to-order omelet. I did stuff myself with the desserts -- namely creme brulee and a nutella with banana crepe (made-to-order).   Noticed they didn't replace any of the food while I was there. At least the authentic French items which were barely touched.  To touch upon my rock star weekend, got to use the VIP entrance as my friend was a Platinum Member. Apparently it saved us a two hour wait to eat.",

Typically this would be worth it EXCEPT, everything I'd gotten on my plate was either cold or lukewarm. And the eggs benedict was like something I'd expected to get at a place comparable to a Ryan's buffet chain. All of the labels were mixed up as well, so I couldn't tell what some of the food even was. The pastries were hard too, like they were brought out from the day before. I went there on an empty stomach and was starving, and even then the food was just disgusting. I expected much more from the Paris, and I won't ever be going back to their buffet.",

Reason #2: the quality of the buffet is a lot better than the other buffets I've been to. They've got great variety plus everything is delicious, especially their prime rib (which is saying a lot because I am not the biggest fan of red meat). Sadly, I do not remember most of the things I got but I do remember enjoying my meal immensely.  5 stars! I'll see you again soon Paris.",

However, our large group got to skip the line since they were trying to fill up tables.  Highlights: great raw seafood - shrimp, snow crab, etc.  The flan was damn good as well as the crepe area.  For ~$25 this is a great way to get fat.  Also, this was for the champagne brunch - which is a fun way to start the day and watch the hungover people in your group cringe.  I'm not a fan of champagne at my buffet because I am there to get my grub on.  Definitely a place to go if you're bored of Wynn or Bellagio.",

There is a large variety to choose from, some I would check eat station out before making selections. My personal favorites include the cork screw pasta with truffle oil, mushrooms, and asparagus, also the potato leek soup, the macarons, the crepes both sweet and savory, they make them from scratch for you, as well as the lamb in the back corner. I also enjoyed the tomato mozzarella salad, the mussels, and my boyfriend said the pork was delicious. We went here fo lunch twice and breakfast once. They have french toast, pancakes, belgium waffles, all different eggs, eggs benedict etc. The breads looked great but I didn't want o waste any space. All of the staff is friendly and will answer any of your questions. I also happened to have met the assistant pastry chef and he was really nice to talk to.

I came for dinner with a bunch of friends and I felt bad for hyping this place up only to disappoint.  Do I smell change in management?    Only stone crab, unpeeled mediocre-sized shrimp, and weak prime rib.  Even the crepes and desserts, which I find Paris should be the best at, wasn't as impressive.  The brunch always seems to be the best for me here.    Sorry, but as of now, I won't be returning for a while here.  What ever happened to that \"Fast-Pass\" Disneyland type system they implemented before where you take a ticket and come back at a designated time for a shorter line instead of waiting in the longer line?  I thought that worked out so well before.  My heart was crushed at Paris.  I'd rather shell out more at the oh-so-lovely Wynn.",

Maybe I just don't eat enough French food to be 'over it,' but I think it's great that there are few American dishes here. They also tend to have veggies cooked in yummy ways.

So I pulled her aside and asked her for a nut cracker and she was like \"oh yes, I suppose we got some in today\" This was my WTF moment. I had to ask 3 different people for extra napkins or even a refill because the first 2 would forget. It was just horrible.   The Food was not great for a nice hotel like this. Deserts were overly sweet and food was overly salty. My sister basically got a raw piece of prime rib.

The entire inside of the restaurant has the facade of a Paris village, very different from most of the buffets, which look like a restaurant in a hotel.  The positives didn't stop at the decor though, as we all really enjoyed the food as well!  There is a fresh made-to-order crepe station.  I was disappointed that they were out of bananas when I went up, and the apple filling was cold, not warmed, but the crepes were still delicious.  The French station with roasted chicken, leek mashed potatoes and provencial dishes was excellent.  Another surprising highlight of my meal was the pretzel bread from the bread display.  If you visit this buffet, don't miss the fresh pretzel bread!  Overall, they had a great variety of dishes for brunch from breakfast foods like fresh waffles to more traditional French fare and a plentiful seafood station.  The one aspect of our meal that was really lacking was service.  We had to flag our waitress down several times to refill our glasses after they sat empty while she passed by on more than one occasion.  I would be willing to overlook the service and still recommend this buffet for a wonderful Sunday brunch, and hope you get a better waitress for your visit!",

I guess I should have been worried when the last Zagat review they had posted outside  was from 2005.  First, we had to wait in line for over an hour for their \"Champagne Brunch.\"  Brunch?  Usually brunch is pretty heavy on the breakfast food, but here there wasn't much at all.  What they did have was lukewarm, and nothing I couldn't make better at home.  The one highlight was their mini-waffles, which were buttery and fluffy.  The service was terrible; our waiter got our drink orders wrong, didn't give us any spoons for the coffee, and argued with my friend when she asked for tea water that was actually hot.  It wasn't worth the $24.99 at all.  4 Words: Go To The Wynn!",

I think all the Vegas buffets are the same.  Although, I did find that the Prime Rib and the Lamb tasted better here than at the other buffets.  They had a crepe station which was kind of cool.  Banana chocolate crepe, yum.  I was very disappointed with their dessert.  But I did like that they had waffle cones for their ice cream.",

The only reason we didn't go was her friend didn't want to spend the $30/head to eat dinner there.  Fast forward to a trip I made with my boyfriend, I insisted we go.  We stood in line for probably 20 minutes, forked over our cash, and were taken to our seats.  This is a True buffet - it is just random foods that really having nothing to do with Paris.  The salad bar looked pretty rough so I skipped it.  Boo.  I actually couldn't find anything that was really delicious.  I was eating just to fill up as opposed to enjoying and appreciating the food, flavors, presentation.  YES, it is a buffet, I get that, but the food tasted really boring.  Heck, the Orleans buffet blows this one away.  They boasted of their giant crab legs when we were paying (before eating), but the guy in the seafood hut told us they haven't had them in a week.  The drink lady took forever to come around.  We were finished our first plate by the time she came over.  I really wanted to love this place, so much that I was willing to be pretty forgiving.  But when all was said and done, I found myself apologizing to the boyfriend for having subjected him to it.  O.O",

Why we were up and at'em that early in Vegas is another story altogether.  Anyway, we did have somewhere in the vicinity of a 20-minute wait to be seated, but it was worth it.  The buffet is broken up into multiple stations, each offering different regional French fair.  There are obviously your standard breakfast items available, but the more abstract items really drew our attention.  They have $10 bottles of wine (yeah it was breakfast, what of it?) and a great crepe station.  I highly recommend this buffet for breakfast.",

    "text": "This hotel and its buffet have seen better days!  As a Diamond Total Rewards Card member I was not treated as I have been at other Harrahs properties...and even as a regular patron, the food and the service was sub par at best. It took a solid 10 minutes before I saw a waiter for my beverage order. When I asked a passing employee if there were waiters or if soda was available for self service he was gruff and dismissive - simply replying \"yes\" and walking away. The meats were over cooked, my pork chop being dry and the only option for prime rib being well done. Who serves prime rib well done?  No one should!  The entire roast at the carving station was either well done or really well done. The food at the buffet looked as if it had been sitting there untouched for hours, and the serving spoons were sticky and dirty- disgusting!  When someone behind the buffet was informed of the gross spoons they thanked me but nothing was done about it. They have one male and one female washroom inside the buffet, which was nice because at most casinos you need to leave the buffet to use the casino washroom - unfortunately, it looked like the tiles were falling off the walls and it was not clean. You can tell a lot about the care of a place by its washrooms!  We chose this buffet because we saw the 7pm show at Paris, Jersey Boys, which was highly enjoyable. The cost of the dinner buffet with the Total Rewards discount was $30 pp, costing nearly $100 for the three of us after taxes and tip. There are much better dining options...Chipotle next door at Planet Hollywood would have been better than this buffet. I would not suggest this buffet to anyone.  One last thing I feet was important to mention...my husband and I each had previous careers in food service,  and should have walked out when we noticed 4 I refrigerated quarts of dairy product sitting in the desert sections hand wash sink and the tap dripping on them. It was a big RED FLAG but we didn't want to make the third person with us feel bad because they had selected the restaurant and we had already been present for half an hour.  I wonder when their last health inspection was...",

    "text": "Of the buffets I tried with the Buffet of Buffets Pass, Le Village Buffet was my favorite (went there for breakfast and dinner).  Not only do they have a good selection of pretty decent quality food but I love the theme of this place.  As with the rest of the Paris shops area, Le Village Buffet is decorated to make it seem like you are literally eating inside a village and going to various houses/shops for your food...super cute!  Breakfast included lox and bagels, various cream cheeses, mini quiches, made to order omelets, different flavored yogurts, fresh fruits, muffins and pastries and dessert crepes.  Dinner included not only French fare but there were also Italian and Middle Eastern dishes as well as sushi.  There were also tons of crab legs and cocktail shrimp as well as raw oysters.  However, my favorite was definitely the desserts.  I tried their creme brulee, flan, tiramisu, fruit tart, chocolate cake and a pistachio cookie bar thing and they were all delicious.  I probably got my money's worth with just trying their desserts...lol.  The desserts alone are enough to entice me back...yum!  P.S. Our server introduced us to palmers (tea mixed with lemonade) and it is soo good and refreshing...you have to try it if you go!",

My brother commented on how much he liked the ambiance.  This is one of the reasons I really like coming here.  Our waitress was polite, kept our glasses filled and removed the dishes quickly.  The lunch was not as good as the breakfast we had several years back.  For instance, the lamb was a bit overcooked and a bit tough.  They ran out of strawberries and whipped cream for the crepes...maybe they need to plan better?  To be honest, nothing really stuck out in my mind as excellent.  And this was my favorite breakfast buffets!    Overall, I wouldn't go for lunch but will definitely go for breakfast.",

But lunch this time around was so pathetic. The selections are really heavy on the meat. Veal, roast beef (which is dry and inedible), pork, chicken, sausages, everything. I'd normally love a meat-centric meal, if it were actually good. But the quality of the meat was just horrible, and it's not like it had been sitting out for a few hours - we got to lunch just as they were switching over from breakfast. Meat and bread?! What kind of peasant meal is this?! Though I'd probably have difficulty laying out a strong selection for lunch. What are you supposed to serve anyway, sandwiches?! Lunch should be dinner, but lighter.. and with eggs.   The desserts were also pretty lame.. I was excited they had French macarons but the creme brulee was more flan than creme boo. The one thing I can say is that the coffee was good, and unlimited.   I'm not liking their fluorescent blue lighting in the main room - if you can, get seated in the tiny dining rooms off to the side with warm lighting and French accents. Warm lighting is important to a healthy appetite!  Go for the breakfast, ONLY!!",

We slipped in right before dinner started so after an amazing plate of brie and bacon macaroni, shrimp cocktail, and I don't even remember what else I got a plate stacked with crab legs. I've never had chilled crab but that didn't stop me from eating somewhere around 2 lbs of it, then getting a spiced apple crepe and creme brulee to finish it off. We also took advantage of the all you can drink mimosas (wine, beer and champagne where also available) and I think the waiter was waiting for us to fall out of our chairs before we were done. Little did he know who he was dealing with. The service was extremely fast, the food was varied and very well prepared. The ambiance was relaxed but classy, quaint but fun. Next time I'm in Vegas I definitely plan to hit this place again.  PS - I'm not 100% sure if it reaches this far but the patisserie near here has the only free wifi I found on the Strip.",

That being said, they make your crepes for you fresh (unlike the Spice Market at Planet Hollywood). You can top your crepes (they actually fold your fruits in like the Taco Bell cruch wrap supreme) with strawberry, banana, cherry, peaches and nuts.   I got there for breakfast and got to look at the omlette bar right before they took it down. They do tend to focus a little more on \"french\" food and desserts, but it's still your standard buffet fare. This buffet is better than the average buffet because there is a HUGE amount of variety, even for a Vegas buffet.   I really liked the way that even inside the buffet, they made an effort to continue the Parisian small town motiff. Servers are dressed up peasant style (my memory might be faulty and it might have just been the seating hostesses. . . my mind was fully preoccupied on crepes)  For those who sleep in late, or are stuck in the long line outside worrying about missing out on delicious food, don't worry! They WON'T kick you out once breakfast is over. You can just sit there, nurse your pleasantly stuffed belly, and wait till you feel like continuing on to lunch!   If you love crepes, this is a must for a Las Vegas buffet stop (I also highly recommended the creperie across from the buffet if the buffet line is too long, the crepes are better)",

Other than that I don't think I will come back honestly.",

    "text": "From a vegetarian standpoint (although my meat-eater girlfriend agrees), bar none the BEST Vegas buffet. Well worth the hefty pricetage you'll pay almost any time of day for this killer buffet, which on my recent trip included: cheese ravioli w marinara or garlic cream sauce, fresh-baked breads, foreign cheeses, candied yams, mashed potatoes, roasted garlic potatoes, garlic green beans, and create-your-own-crepes were the best parts of the meal but I ate so much that I was literally in pain by the time I left.  Non-vegetarian wise, my girlfriend loved the meat products, including fresh carved meats, sushi, seafood, chicken, French onion soup, and so much more. I can't recall everything that we ate, but we cleaned up good.  I will say this, DON'T MISS THE CREPES but make sure you have room in your stomach to eat them because ooooh my god they are amazing. I ordered strawberry-banana-chocolate crepes and could only get through half of it, despite how bad I was drooling for more. My stomach just could not contain.  The ambiance of the experience is half the fun as well. It's like you're sitting outside at a French market cafe, all blue skies above and a cozy, intimate seating area. Tres romantique, oui?",

Go to the Diamond/Seven Stars entrance, which is a separate door, and ask about it.  This was the one buffet with macaroons, which I was excited about.  I'd been searching for them all day.  But they weren't very good.  Mushy.  Yuck.  A lot of things are mislabeled here.  Some are just funny.  Parmesan cheese was labeled as red onion.  But then mayo was labeled as tzatziki, which angered me. (Holly smash!) I dipped some pita in it and ate it before I realized it was not tzatziki.  I hate it when buffets mislabel things.  They did have Mediterranean selections, which surprised me.  But you need to hunt for the good stuff.  They had a basket of pita that was stale and nasty.  But elsewhere in the station, they had nice hot fresh pita.  There are restrooms in the buffet but the ladies room is one stall and completely useless.  Just plan on using the restrooms outside as you come and go.  Not really impressed with this buffet given the hype.",

(This makes up for a terrible experience two years ago, where I waited two hours to get in to brunch, and the server refused to replenish the crab legs.) The best part is the crepe station, where the very friendly cook makes delicious stuffed crepes to order. YUM! The only drawback is that they seem to be understaffed, and the wait for drinks and to have plates removed, takes forever. All in all, I will definitely go back, and I now prefer this buffet to the one at Bellagio.",

The assortment of food was not that good so I ended up going back a few times for the same dishes. The crepe maker was good though. Delicious. When you pay at the front, they cross out the tip portion. I guess that means leave a tip at the table?",

That seemed reasonable since most other buffets in Vegas are around that price or more. The seating area looked like I was sitting in an alley which was okay giving the theme. The sushi was cold and tasted like out of a box. The salad was bland. The selection of different varieties was pretty sad. Felt like I walked into a cheap cheap buffet and felt cheated out of my money. A message to whoever runs it: invest in better chefs, better quality food, and a better selection for people who are spending their hard earned money to eat at your buffet. I will never go back to Paris buffet. Even the server didn't seem too caring... crack a smile. I loved the inside of the Paris hotel and casino but unfortunately I will not be staying at a hotel that does not care enough to feed its customers good food. If your someone who does not eat meat or chicken, don't even bother. This buffet doesn't really have much to offer to you. Wish I would've saw what they had before I paid.",

Granted, the line is terribly long but if you come a wee bit early (around 5:30pm?) chances are you will get in within 20 minutes.  I particularly liked the coq au vin, and the duck confit was awesome! I enjoyed the grilled chicken and thought it went really well with the grilled pepper, summer squash, and zucchini.  There were some thin crispy, dare I say, flat breads that had a great umami taste that I had multiple helpings of.  There were the snow crab legs and crab claws that every other person seemed to be raving about but I didn't try any of them. I, however, partook in wolfing down copious amounts of the shrimp cocktail.   The dessert spread was ok though it, I felt, didn't befit a \"french spread.\" That still didn't stop me from enjoying the delicious bread pudding with whipped cream.  This buffet is also part of the so called \"seven-buffet\" deal where you get a 24 hour pass to pig out on any or all of the (seven) buffet spreads across on the Vegas strip.  I will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "A Brunch Disappointment. We went for brunch on November 12; our disappointment is as follows:  1. Entrees: prime rib was significantly undercooked and tough to chew. Best left for those who like to chew on bloody towels. Tri-tip steak was equally tough and overcooked. \"Sushi\" was, on my estimate, 80% rice/seaweed, 15% soggy breading, 5% shrimp. The main highlights were the buttery mashed potatoes and dessert crepes - seriously, the mashed potatoes were the best thing there. Much of the other entrees were dry and untouched, largely things that you wouldn't want at a Vegas buffet: spaghetti, penne pasta, mixed vegetables. Crab legs were okay - skinny without significant meat. Other foods like sausage, bacon, pancakes, waffles were all bland and just plain boring, as evidenced by their dryness sitting under the heat lamps for hours.   My honest opinion is that you could get better quality and variety of food at a Golden Corral.   2. Desserts: flan was too eggy and pudding like, lacked the airy consistency desired in French made flan. Creme brulee was okay; burnt sugar collapsed with scoop of the spoon and did not break cleanly - likely because it had been sitting. Macaroons taste cheap and have cake frosting filling.   My honest opinion is that you should just go to McDonalds and get a McFlurry.   3. Ambiance: Cheap, like a 90's theme park waiting to be renovated. False bricks and dusty old signs leave nothing to be desired, completely unromantic and opposite from the True Paris. Tacky. Furniture is reminiscent of a 90's Perkins.   My honest opinion is that you and your date might strike the mood better at a Chuck e Cheese.   4. Price: $30.99 for brunch and bottomless mimosas til 3PM. It's what you expect for this price in Vegas.   My honest opinion is that you should spend a little bit more money for a significantly better buffet elsewhere in hotels in the same vicinity.   5. Service: possibly the only redeeming quality of this buffet; the attendants met expectation and removed dirty plates and refilled water/mimosas in a timely manner.",

Also tried the sauteed mushrooms... yummy! For dessert, there were choices of tiramisu, creme brulee, creme caramel... oh, yes, I tried them all! Originally priced at $30.99/ea with their rewards card. We used our dining voucher from our timeshare resort gifted to us. Lighting was dim and the atmosphere was themed as if dining outdoors in a village (hence, the name of this buffet restaurant). The servers were dressed as village locals. Had great dining experience here.  Review #0193",

OMFG i cant believe she tried to pull a fast one stupid old couple thinking they are better than us just because we look young and were a minority. Pisses me off and the stupid front desk lady knows we were in line before them too and i cant believe she still asks who's next. It just shows how she cares for her job here. The waitress women are super nice here and our waitress was awesome and helpful. Although the food sucks ass here. Dont come here if your starving and the eggs are fake here.",

I am being generous at 2 stars.  It really is 1.5 at best. The inside of this Buffet is poorly laid out. Good thing it was nearly empty as one has to run a maze to get back to their table.   My omelette was as heavy as led. What ever they sprayed the pan with overpowered the omelette. blech Then there is the slow slow crepe line. With only 8 people ahead of me I had a twenty minute wait.  Crepe was nothing special.  Hubby was not thrilled with his meal. He did like his almond pastry, said it was the best thing there. Whoopee.  This Buffet needs a serious upgrade.    I want to also add the ladies room closest to the buffet was nasty. I think it was last attended to 14 years ago when I was last there too.",

You pay in advance, and they ask for a tip amount. I am so glad that we said we wouldn't top up front but would leave cash on the table. The service was terrible.  When the waitress came to the table the first time she studied the receipt (which the hostess puts on the table). As it is a one price buffet, all I can surmise is she was checking for tip amount. And since she didn't see any it may explain why we almost never saw her. Dishes piled, drinks went unfilled, unless we overtly flagged her down. And we were seated in the VIP section which made it far more egregious.   The food was meh. Most of it was unlabeled, and no one behind the counter offered any explanation (and there were few behind the counter, even st 9:00 pm). The best food were the crepe station (savory or sweet filled crepes made to order) and the desserts. The crepes were fantastic, as were the macaroons.   There are far better places to eat on the strip, so I'd skip this one.",

I remembered they have a better cheese selection  that was bigger than what I took a picture of.  Disappointing considering this is part of having a French themed buffet right?  Don't even have Brie or blue cheese!  Highlight then is the crepe station.  Another line to wait for though.  The carving station does have roast beef, pork and turkey. Unfortunately the roast can be too rare.  Desserts were nothing to harp about either. Limited Macaroon varieties were available but they do run out / run out of flavors.  I had to wait 30 mins for the replenishment.  It ended up being too sweet for me.  At close to $40 + tips I'd skip this unless they improve the overall experience, it's dated.   Tip:  go in and check out the offerings and decide for yourself if it's worth the line.  Vote with your wallet.",

The line was tremendously long when we arrived at 11:30, but seemingly unbeknownst to most of the patrons, you can actually reserve a seat online using OpenTable as long as you book at least 24 hours in advance.  You just go in the Seven Stars entrance and get to skip the line just like the high-rollers, all due to the ability to navigate a free app!  We also had a Groupon, cutting the price in half AND adding all you can drink wine & beer to the package, making this brunch a tremendous value. Once seated, the choices were what one expects from an upper echelon Vegas brunch buffet: carving station, Eggs Benedict, breakfast meats & potatoes, souffles, pastries, pastas as well as some unexpected options like sushi, pre-cracked crab legs, knockwurst & bratwurst with sauerkraut and a made to order crepe station.  All of the food was of good if not great quality, the stations were clean and well stocked, and the service was prompt and courteous. At full price I'd probably view this as a 4 star brunch buffet at best, but with the Groupon and alcohol included, combined with the ability to skip right past the line, it was undoubtedly a five star value.",

The salmon and duck were over cooked and very salty. The pasta was sitting in a tub of butter. Even the desserts were just okay. Overall very disappointing, especially at $67 for two people.

We arrived at 11:15 on Saturday and we were part of the surprise champagne brunch, and I only mean \"surprise\" in the sense that we did not research and had no idea this option existed! It was about $70 for two of us to have a champagne brunch, they serve bottomless Mamosa's and the options for food were absolutely overwhelming; which is a problem I love to have! I know there were at least two or three stations I did not even make it too. Just wander around trying to stack my plate as high as possible I did notice they have an entire dessert station that is absolutely darling! The dessert station has everything from your normal croissants with chocolate to petite fruit tarts and individual cakes. There was a seafood station, a crepe station, meat station, breakfast station with the traditional biscuits, gravy, pancakes, fruit and everything was just delicious. I did notice that there was even a sushi station but I didn't get to try any of that. I know some of the hotels offer an unlimited buffet option where you get unlimited access to five local buffets for 24 hours for only $50, at the beginning I felt that was outrageous until I paid $70 for two of us to have our buffet brunch and then I realized I made a horrible mistake and not purchasing that. Even if you only eat twice in 24 hours this deal will more than pay for itself. Our server was sweet and prompt, their uniforms are proper and does not make you feel like you need to avert your eyes, it is very family-friendly and definitely we will be returning to this particular location.",

My husband hardly ate anything at all. Things were cold and just not kept well. I did have a crepe that was tasty but besides that...blah. Makes me sad. This place really went downhill. If you're looking for a great breakfast buffet, go to the one at the cosmopolitan. It was top notch!  Filled with delicious choices.",

The crepe that I had--the strawberry--was really delicious.  I also had an omelet that I couldn't finish, but was a pretty average omelet.  The rest of the food was pretty average and the selection felt limited.  I was pretty bummed out about the pastry selection.  There were some average and ordinary American pastries that looked pretty ordinary.  The crepe made up for the lack of everything else.  YUM.  CREPE!",

I like the truffle mac n cheese, I also like grabbing some crab legs and mixing the crab meat into the mac n cheese :)  The made to order crepe station is also a favourite, both sweet and savoury crepes are tasty.  They also have some sushi, prime rib, and a good variety of desserts.  We got the groupon which was an added bonus and included bottomless drinks. Our server, an asian lady, was very nice and made sure we had a new drink just before finishing our existing one.  Overall a good dining experience, been here for brunch on our previous trip as well, and plan on coming again on our next visit.",

I came for the brunch today and was really disappointed.  One caveat here is that i did co e at 2 pm, about an hour before the dinner service started .  I thought the whole conveyor of a brunch was to have breakfast and lunch the while time .  The eggs Benedict were cold and hard and almost. I Hollandaise sauce .  The cheese station was relegated to one half filled plate .  I figured I would try the prime rib.  They only had straight horseradish - too strong for me .  I asked about the mix with the sour cream and was told - that's not my station - . So I found the guy at the right station and he said - yeah , someone probably forgot to mix it .  He then said they were out of sour cream.  The rest of the items  on the buffet looked like they had been sitting there for a while and 1/2 if the dessert trays were empty . Sad that my go to to spot is gone . . . .",

    "text": "This used to be one of my favorite buffets in Vegas.  Sadly, I think that this last trip here will be my last.  First they have decreased the size on the far left side to accommodate other restaurant expansions meaning your selection has suffered.  In the last 2 months I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast buffets in Las Vegas are one of my favorite things.  There are so many great foods you can do on the cheap and in a variety of ways.  The options were extremely limited. They didn't even have basic French toast or waffles.  I did not notice a significant difference in the food choices between lunch and dinner.  In the past one my favorite dishes to get here was the coq au vin.  They seem to have removed this from the menu.  Rest of the choices are uninspiring with the only exception being the seafood bouillabaisse.  The biggest travesty when it comes to lack of selection is no longer offering the cookie butter fluffernutter crepe.  Anytime I was in Vegas I would make a special trip here just for that one item. It appears to be gone from the menu.  The biggest problem I've noticed recently is the poor service from the wait staff. Sometimes it's due to having too large of an area to cover. Other times the problem stems from poor communication between the hostess and the wait staff. Ultimately though I believe the wait staff is just slow. They really don't do much other than bringing you drinks. This problem could be reduced if they had self service beverage stations like Spice Market at Planet Hollywood.  I'm sad to see what was once a must visit buffet now be cut my list of \"to-do's\" in Vegas.",

    "text": "Bon Appetit!!  I've been here several times, but my recent visit to Vegas during the summer we did the 5 Buffet of Buffets 24 hours pass for $45. Without it, price for regular brunch and dinner is $30, but for $15 more you can visit one of several different local buffets as many times as you'd like in a 24 hour period. Definitely a good deal and worth it.   Out of all the buffets in Vegas, Le Village Buffet is truly a theme type buffet transporting guest to a French countryside, complete with cobblestone streets, sky, trees and French village. It feels more like an attraction in a Disneyland theme park without the rides and you're greeted with amazing foods from the five provinces of France (Alsace, Brittany, Burgundy, Normandy, and Provence). So hang on to your forks and spoons cause you're about to take a ride for some good grub.   As for the food, most were delicious, good quality and prepared fresh. When doing the 24hr deal, best time to come here is during breakfast or lunch. Since Caesar's Bacchanal was closed for remodeling, we ended up here (saved Rio for dinner). My favorite dishes and suggestions include:  Cream brulee - Nice crisp texture from carmelize sugar and sweet creamy custard so wonderfully good.  Salads - standards selection and basic dressings - Ok Pistachio lemon macarons - tasty, more like cookies. I prefer Lettes thou. Brie Mac N Cheese - savory, good firm texture (not creamy or mushy) and good. Flan - sweet custard and okay (better off having cream brulee). Bananas Foster - okay (better at Planet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet) Churros - okay (even Costco taste better) Breakfast sausage, bacon, pancakes and french toast - standard, decent and okay. Duck confit - savory and delicious (anything cooked in its own fat is always good). Tiramisu - Ok (better at Rio). Fresh Made Crepes - Stuffed banana, nutella, and hazelnut, strawberry - average and tasty. Not sure if its worth 15-20 minute wait sometimes. Bring two plates so you don't have to wait in line again. Eggs Benedict - Good Sushi - Ok. Pasta with Truffles - Anything with truffles is good. Veal, Lamb & Prime rib - tender and excellent. Salmon - Tasty and good. Shrimp  - Average size and comes with shell. Mussels - Tasty and good. Crabs legs - not pre-cracked (more work), but good.  Overall - 3.5. Service was pretty decent and attentive. Nice ambience and beautiful scenery. Waitress came by regularly to refill our drinks and clear our used plates. Cette nourriture est delicieux (Food is Delicious)!!   Cons - Killer lines during main lunch and dinner hours. Get here early or pay extra $10 to cut in front of the line.",

The poor waitress was pleasant and you could see she was doing the best she can...mgmt should be changed there.  The price is another reason for the poor rating.

This place is on par to your local Hometown Buffet. Everyone seemed so miserable working there. From the cashiers to meat slicer to crepe pourer to servers; everyone had this scowl on their faces that screams: I HATE MY JOB or I HATE MY BOSS.

    "text": "Haven't really ever had any issues here but this visit was different.  We had the buffet of buffets pass and I am a diamond member so we always hit the buffets without having to wait in the long lines.  We were sat in the diamond area and didn't realize that they had put platinum on the receipt.  The server was literally at the table when we were sat.  So we sit, we already ordered our drinks at the entrance counter, went around the entire buffet, I even got a crepe.  Get back to the table and my bestie informs me that the waitress just got our drink order.  While waiting the 12 minutes for our drinks to come back, a hostess starts questioning us about who sat us there and why we were sitting at that table.  I informed her that another hostess sat us here because I was a diamond member, she huffed and puffed and didn't believe me until I showed her my card, that was already on the table, and then started murmuring something about the counter people needing to do their jobs better.  Our waitress has finally come back with our drinks and cups and started walking off with the coffee.  She said maybe she should stop smoking so much, so either she was taking a smoke break while she was supposed to be getting our drinks or she smokes too much pot and can't handle being a glorified busser.  The only saving grace on this trip to the buffet was the crepe guys, they were fantastic!",

    "text": "So, I went here with people out of desperation for food. Someone who had been here before recommended it so here I was at 8 PM. Service had placed us in a corner of a room and it was very stuffy.   In terms of the food, all I could taste was cheese, butter, and salt. I mean, I guess I expected it since it was a buffet.. Crab legs tasted funny and the soups were very oily.  Service was interesting because I felt like their waiters waited for tips. During the time I was eating, our waiter disappeared forever and the people next to me had a huge stack of plates that was piling. No one got refills of water and the place was looking dirty. You could always see the waiter with a dish cart near by, but he just kind of stood there and stared at us through the door way - it was kind of creepy.   The people next to us left without tipping, so after the waiter saw that, he began hawking us and constantly took away our dishes/gave us refills. There were moments where he just stood there in the room counting his money in front of us (signaling that we should give him a tip). The whole time he was doing this, the empty tables by us were still filled with stacks of dirty dishes.  Overall, the food is sub-par and the service is creepy. :) Good luck.",

Food was awesome: delicious breads and cheeses to make believe that I was really in Paris, brie/bacon macaroni, french toast, and customizable crepes.

Went for breakfast, the deal not so bad, about $35 for two people. The food selection, absolute crap. Don't even bother or waste your time, it was just cafeteria food. The only reason to go is the crepes but even that wasn't great. I saw in another review someone comparing it to Hometown Buffet, that's an insult to Hometown. Ha! Somebody else said Sysco food, and bingo, that's it. I think this whole Buffet of Buffet thing has ruined them. In putting my business acumen to work I would speculate that all the hotels involved in the B of B got together, buy a bulk of food at a nice discount, and then just distribute it amongst themselves. That's why it doesn't stand out and that's why the quality has eroded. The toppings look old for some reason, no better way to describe it. The workers there seem miserable, I don't know exactly why. If a crepe is what you seek, go across the hallway to the crepe baker and save your time waiting in line for this place. Never again, especially after having the Wynn. How sad.",

    "text": "We were there this weekend for breakfast, and ended up having brunch due to the long line.  It was $24.99 for brunch.  The wait was long but the food was ok.  I like from a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6, compared to the Wynn which I give a 9.  A lot of their food lacked flavor.  The line was long and the dessert bar SUCKED!  I love dessert, and it is a 3 compared to the Wynn which i give a 10.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Taste wise, I did not care for it.  Our waitress was great, she was very busy, but she tried to keep up with our needs especially the mimosa refills, which I guess was the only good thing about the buffet because it was included and non stop refills.  I would have given this place a 3 star except for the situation that happened while we were waiting for a table.  Originally we had 4 people for the buffet, and a few of our friends joined us and it turned into 9.  Which after waiting for an hour and a half in line, we didn't want to wait for a larger table.  There was a large group in front of us maybe about 20 before we got there and they waited for a while for a table.  So we decided that we were going to split into 2 groups since we weren't going to leave the restaurant at the same time anyways.  So we told our waitress that we wanted to go from 9 people into 2 groups of 4 and 5.  Well, when we told her that she got mad, but we weren't even next in line for a table.  We were maybe about 10 people behind being next.  So we did ask if we can get seated near each other if possible but when we told her, Marta the hostess got all mad at us and started giving us dirty looks.  We were then seated and a few minutes later my friends that met us up there were seated as well, they were seated on the opposite side of the restaurant where there was another table that was vacant the whole entire time they were there even before they were seated.  So Marta could have seated us together but she didn't and while we were eating the whole time she kept giving us dirty looks.  We later realized that if it was a party of 8 people or more the gratuity charge is 18%.  So we were given bad service with dirty looks because our hostess wasn't going to get the 18% gratuity charge.  I have been to Rio and the Wynn's buffet, and never at any of the other two buffets had we had bad service due to a gratuity charge.  Like I said you get what you pay for.  And another thing that I almost forgot to mention if you are looking for the omelet station, look at the dessert bar, because it's not near where the savory food is, but if you are looking for the crepe bar, it is next to where the savory food are and oh don't get banana's for your crepe, because they are brown and mushy.",

I went on Easter Sunday, I waited in line for a 100 yrs. No Champagne. I guess they were too religious to serve champagne. Whatever, its vegas. They were unapologetic, rude, and ridiculous. We had done many a birthday meal here, 20+ people for years and years. The food is great, the pastry area alone is worth it. But I can't stand crappy service and their ambivalence to having their short comings pointed out. I am currently 'buffetless' in vegas, and considering I think most buffets are a hepatitis bar anyway.... oh well.",

The food is just two steps short of inedible, specifically the crepes.  The chef has a horrible attitude.  So unless you like your crepes to taste more like pancakes with disgusting canned fillings, take your appetite somewhere else.  Perhaps even somewhere without lighting so dreary and dark that you can barely see your food or your dining companions.  My best guess about this place is that they purposely make it miserable so people leave quickly.  Depressing experience, both food and atmosphere wise.

I can only think that the line is so long because people like ourselves hadn't been there before and the French village setting is very appealing. Except for a very good waiter, it was all downhill from there. The selection of food was mediocre, which corresponded with it's quality and flavor. The only thing I thought was decent was the prime rib and I was looking for something a little more exciting. My wife stood in line for a crepe (lines -- not me). The person cooking them was desperately trying to find help to bring her ingredients as she was running out.  My wife finally got her crepe, it wasn't cooked properly and inside was cold. I expected to find excellent breads and pastries -- I was extremely disappointed.  And it was dirty too -- no one was cleaning up around spills etc., along the buffet dishes.",

    "text": "Located in Paris Las Vegas, the ambiance in here is just so cute! A small French and a street where you eat (of course with a formal table and chairs). The streets are decorated with streetlights, signs, bells, and other things that really make you feeling like being in a actual French town. The sections where you get the foods are those small shops by the street, which make you feel like buying things from different shops on that traditional French town. The food is not the best food in Paris Las Vegas, but you get to east A LOT OF DIFFERENT FOODS, including a variety of meat from prime rib, turkey breast, ham, lamb, fried turkey, sausages, and seafood include crabs, shrimps, and a lot more, and the most special that no other buffet has it - crepe, a kind of French pancake with fruits and stuffing of your choice wrapped inside with or without chocolate syrup. The price is ok, not expansive but not cheap, that it costs $24.99 per adult on a regular day, $29.99 for peak travel period or holidays. Tip is optional since you pay before you go in.",

I never remember anything special about this buffet, other than they have a crepes station (which actually only tasted so-so this time, they ran out of nutella!).  Not that the food was bad, it actually tasted pretty good.  I had some of the prime rib, which was decent and cooked to a nice medium rare (that doesn't happen too often at buffets), fancy mac n cheese, creamed spinach...these I remember as tasting good.  I also sampled lots of other things but don't remember them.  They have a tiny sushi station now (??) that seems very out of place and frankly would be better without it as it only served crap (like pseudo california rolls with imitation crab sticks, bleh).  I was disappointed by their dessert selection (but I forgot/didn't see any creme brulee!).  Just had a mediocre crepe and raspberry cheesecake.  So, the food tastes decent but not memorable, and seems like a small selection (I prefer the bigger places like Rio's buffet) and not worth the price ($25 for dinner).",

Just before I left, I noticed a gentleman at the table next to us feasting on a huge bowl of HOT STEAMING CRAB LEGS. I asked our waitress what's the deal, she replied it was a VIP gambler, only VIP's get the hot crab. Excuse me? I just dropped almost $100 for two people and I don't get the steamed crab? Wow. Ripoff. Not cool. Other than this glaring defect we enjoyed most of the other items, good tasting sauces on some of the chicken items, the meatballs and a couple other items. Spend a few more bucks and go to Ceasars Bacchanal buffet, my current favorite and a supreme feast for about $50.",

We got a Groupon for the buffet which turned out to be an excellent deal for two since it not included food but also unlimited mimosas, wine and beer (usually a $11.99 add on). The interior and set up of Le Village Buffet is amazing and I kind of felt like I should be bicycling through it while donning a beret! They make a lot of use out of the space and it's like you're in a little French village (so I think at least, I've never been but that's how I picture it). They have stations for different cuisines and items such as sushi, meats, salad, seafood, dessert, etc. But when I saw the crepe bar I started to get really excited because I adore crepes so game was on. They have about eight varieties of both sweet and savory crepes and the banana nutella crepes made my day! They were absolutely perfect and smothered in chocolate and whipped cream, I was in fatty fat heaven! Unfortunately that was the pinnacle of the buffet-I tried other items such as grilled lamb (flavorless), crab legs (skimpy), cooked veggies like brussel sprouts (overcooked) and nothing really tickled my palate that much after the crepes. Unlimited mimosas and our excellent server, Mitzy, made up for it though!  I would go here again with a coupon or discounted price but I wouldn't pay full price for it.",

The buffet has beautiful decor giving you a romantic outdoor feel without dealing with bugs!  In addition to the beautiful outdoor section they have nice sectioned off rooms with really quaint french decor.  The food has always been really delicious at these buffet ( maybe not the best but I think the best bargain for the quality of atmosphere and food) The dessert area is really mind blowing. I dare you to leave without wanting to eat something from their dessert bar! IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN!  I had to try everything from the creme brulee, cheescake, cake balls, parfaits, flan, and colored macaroons. I'm still shocked that I don't have diabetes from going to this buffet.

My friend works for the company and had free passes, so I decided to give this another chance, even though I said I wouldn't,  because a lot can change in 4, 6, 8 years.  So let's see what changed...oh yes! they had Creme Brulee!  I didn't get to eat it, because I had a creme brulee phase 4 years ago, now it's over so I don't really care for it anymore. Their crepe station was excellent, along with their crepe chef, who was very nice and funny (5 stars for this alone if I could do that)...   What else, what else....think...thinking...thinking...nothing.  Nothing much has changed - still A-OK per Yelp's 3-star standard. So sorry, but won't be visiting the buffet at Paris again. Instead, I'll stick to the creperie or the pizza place across the way.",

    "text": "Let me just say this:  My first visit to Paris buffet was for the Sunday brunch, which my group waited almost two hours for. We spent most of that time standing, sitting on the floor and leaning on walls as we needed to. When we all were seated, we ran for our first rounds and devoured our food, drinking unlimited mimosas as we went along. Between the first and second rounds a MOTHER EFFING CURTAIN ROD fell from the wall above us, swung down and almost knocked the life out of my friend (whose skull was spared because I motioned him closer to say something at the very instant the rod came crashing down).   Meal refunds, a switch from unlimited mimomas to straight up champagne (which our server kept pouring), three rounds of food, and a year later, WE WENT BACK.   It's THAT good.   Granted, after the whole curtain rod debacle, we were terrified to be seated in one of the \"indoor\" areas, but the food drew us back in. The meats are cooked really well and are good quality- so are all the other hot dishes. The bread selection is exceptional, which is to be expected of a french buffet. I wish I could've had more of the dinner options, but was out there was great (just can't remember what I had). Lastly, the dessert and crepes lent to making it one of the better buffets for sweets (this coming from a person who hates most buffet desserts).   I haven't been back for a while since Studio B and M stole my attention, but this ranks high amongst my choices.",

    "text": "Wish I Spent that Money Elsewhere We paid $130 for three of us to have dinner. We really aren't an \"Al You Can Eat\" kind of family but we are willing to pay for a quality meal. Unfortunately we didn't receive that. Luckily, we made reservations in advance on Open Table so we did not need to wait in the 1 hour plus line. We were seated after payment was taken and the server came by to get our drink orders. My 12 year old daughter, husband and I walked around the buffet to take in the offering before choosing what we wanted to eat. I started with a small bit of the two salads they offered and a half a cup of their potato leek soup. The salads weren't worth finishing, so I didn't figuring I would go back for something tastier. The soup was very good but also very fatty. My daughter go a piece of turkey with gravy and mashed potatoes. These were both good. Not amazing, but good. My husband got several crab legs that he said were \"pretty good\". On our second trip, I got the Truffle Macaroni and a roll. The Truffle Mac was very good and the roll wasn't anything special. My daughter got a plate of fruit which she said wasn't ripe. My husband got the Turkey and mashed potatoes. Then, since we hadn't been wow'd yet, we decided to try the crepes, which is what everyone raves about. My husband and I stood in line for 20 minutes to get our crepes. When we got back to the table, I cut open my Caprese crepe to find that the cheese wasn't even melted and the tomatoes were still cold. The same was True for my husbands ham and cheese crepe. In addition, the ham seemed low quality. What a bummer! My daughter then went to the crepe station and waited 25 minutes for her Nutella Crepe. This one was very good. I think they are trying to pump crepes out so fast that they aren't making them properly. There should be more stations to accommodate the busier hours. For Dessert we tried a selection of most of what they had to offering. The only things worth having more than one bite was the Creme Brulee and the Purple Macaroon.  I felt really disappointed by this dining experience. For this price I could have gone to one of the nice restaurants on the strip and enjoyed a meal much more.",

I hate the idea of over-paying for mediocre food, just so that you can stuff yourself to near unconsciousness (to \"get your money's worth\") and feel disgusting afterwards. This has been my experience with most buffets in the past and why Le Village Buffet at Paris Hotel and Casino was such a pleasant and delicious surprise.   I went to this Buffet with my mom, husband, and two kids for the Champagne Brunch on a Sunday. First of all, UNLIMITED MIMOSAS...nuff said, right? But then they took it a step further and had amazing food. The French Toast was incredible, scrambled eggs were well seasoned (which is rare, even if you're not at a buffet), sausage was plump and juicy, and the bacon was crisp and perfectly cooked. But the real show-stealer was the crepe station. There was a bit of a line, but it was well worth the wait. They had about 8 selections to choose from (4 sweet, 4 savory) and each was made to order right in front of you. This buffet is worth coming to for the mimosas and crepes alone. But I of course had to try the creme brulee as well, and it was fantastic...not the best I've had, but no doubt delicious.   The only reason I did not give this buffet 5 stars is because only the breakfast food was enjoyable. Being brunch, I felt that some of the more lunch-type items were seriously lacking in comparison to their breakfast counterparts. Not even worth eating, in my opinion. But our server was friendly and attentive (also a rarity at a buffet) and she kept the mimosas coming. All in all, I think Le Village Buffet may have restored my faith in buffets and made me willing to try more...if only I can resist going back to this one every time.",

While the food it self wasn't particularly memorable (we have done the buffet at the Palace hotel in San Francisco, which is the best buffet) the ambiance set the scene for what was an enjoyable experience.  The food selection here is diverse and will please most, unless they come expecting mostly French cuisine. The options range from everything from Japanese (sushi) to Mediterranean (hummus). While there are some big winners to pick, like the mozzarella and tomatoes or the crepes, there are some so-so options you will have to deal with as well. The real allure of Le Village Buffet, however, is its appearance. The theme is a quiet little village, while capturing a slightly overdone decor (think Fantasyland at Disneyland) to make it memorable. Was almost worth it alone just to sit in those settings, in fact. In terms of price, it's more expensive than the other options, but does enough to differentiate itself to make it worth it.  Overall, we won't be back, but we are happy we went and feel it's a suggestible activity to try out.",

Good items were the smoked salmon the pita and hummus, but stay away from the dolma.  Odd that they've discontinued the lamb in favor of tritip but it was good tri tip.  Pastries were generally very good and a good solid buffet just not a wow omg type of buffet but I would do it again.",

    "text": "Being a buffet, you gotta compare this to other vegas buffets, and I must say I was expecting better after reading some of the reviews.  First impression were the staff who work there to seat you, and none of them looked like they wanted to be there or help you - not a smile, thank you, nary a pleasantry from anyone.  The one drink waiter who did seem amiable was not very attentive in clearing our used plates and checking in on the drinks that we ordered.  But, being a buffet, you can get away with that if the food is special, and I must say, the only thing special here are the crepes. Yes- they are good, and if you've got a hankering, then this is probably the buffet for you. But the rest of the food was, at best, average, and at worst, cold and bland.  Soups were way over-salted, an admission made by the servers themselves! Salad selections were sparse, meats were mediocre. Desserts were tasty.  Maybe it was an off-day for the buffet, but all I can say overall is that I've definitely have had better buffets in Vegas.",

We waited almost 2 freaking hours in line and when we finally got in, I saw there was a whole section of empty tables in the side area that they could have used to seat people faster.  WTF?  Anyway, we went for dinner and the selection of food was extremely limited.  Definitely not how I remember this place.  Also, the food was pretty tasteless, especially the meats (chicken, lamb) that I tried.  I really only ate some of their pastas, totally not worth paying $26!!  I did, however, try a lot of the desserts (since there was nothing else to eat) and they were really good.  Unless you just wanna eat desserts, I would avoid this place and try other buffets, it's not worth your money.",

There is a large assortment of them, frm eggs benedict to regular scrambled & several in btwn. There is a crepe section, the selection is pre-set, sort of like ordering a combo at mcdonalds. U ask for a #7 & u get a mozzarella, pesto & tomato crepe, it was pretty good, but not great. They hv a good selection of various potatoes & pastries. The croissants were good, but I wasn't impressed . I have heard good things about it so I expected better. I was especially dissapointed in their restroom, yes there is only 1 women's restroom, not several stalls. It was not clean & the soap dispenser was broken. Really? Not something you'd expect to find at this hotel. Its way too expensive & not worth it. Save some $ & take a shuttle to the Orleans buffet, a huge array of good filling food at a cheap price, generally $7.95-$13.95 or so.",

    "text": "So I have been told, many times, that Paris has the best breakfast buffet.  Seeing as how I am not an early riser, especially on a trip to Vega$, I never make it for breakfast.  However, this time I made it for lunch.  For some odd reason, this buffet reminded me of Disneyland, and I don't know why.  Maybe the lines, or the uniforms the waitresses had on, or just the feel.  It just reminded me of New Orleans Square in Disneyland.  Anyway, the food was nice, lots of different choices.  I really liked the croissants and the fruit.  The selection of grilled veggies and hummus was also nice.  I was expecting a little more french food, but it's a buffet, so it's not going to be really nice.  Fiance had some duck, cheese, and pate, but didn't really like any of them.  Not bad though, not bad at all.  Maybe next time I will get up early for breakfast, especially since it is my favorite meal of the day.",

I liked the selection and variety they had. I agree the sushi selection was pitiful, but I was surprised they even had a selection. Sushi is not what I think of when I go to Paris. I tried the handmade crepe and really enjoyed it. I also had a ton of crab. It was very flavorful and not watery like some places. I wasn't sure if it was a champagne brunch or not and finally had to ask someone. Then I had to ask the waitress for some. Once I'd done that, she was good about keeping it coming. Overall I really enjoyed it and would go back. I would just try to show up earlier.",

Incredible range of choices, reasonable price for the food/location/ambiance, and overall just a wonderful treat. The other buffet I tried was at Todai in Planet Hollywood which was also a good place, but Todai was an in-house buffet while  Le Village has a unique atmosphere which resembles, well, a cute little French village right inside the Paris hotel. I loved everything at Le Village, and with the wide variety of food, it's almost impossible to have room for desserts - but you simply have to. Those pretty, tasty, dreamy desserts are just too good to pass. Next time you're in Vegas, come to Paris and dine at Le Village. Then, if you feel like it, take the tour up the 1/2-sized Eiffel Tower to watch the entire Vegas sparkling at night. The dinner and tour will definitely remind you of how much you actually love Vegas ;)",

My favorites were the breads, the lamb, the creme brulee, the chocolate rimmed ice cream cones, the crab legs, the salad, the goat cheese, and last but not leas the Hummus! Yeah, I know, you say who eats hummus at a buffet?  Well, this was the best hummus I have ever had, and I don't even like hummus, AND I'm Greek...so there...eat hummus at this buffet.  I went here 2 days in a row, I don't usually do buffet twice in a weekend but my friend wanted to.  The first time we went for friday night dinner there was no line and I paid about $20 cause I got 5$ off from a reciept that I had from lunch at the hotel that day.  Saturday and Sunday they have champagne brunch even though they don't really advertise it...$26...and the line was huge.  The items I think you should not waste your stomach space on are the sushi (obviously, right?) the rice was nasty and the cheesecake.",

So, overall, it was a good but not so spectacular experience. We got the discount tickets from the half price show/restaurant ticket booth. In retrospect, we paid for 4 dollars for the ticket so if you can get discount tickets from your hotel, that may be cheaper.",

    "text": "Had dinner here on Jan. 4, 2012. Read many reviews before we went that rated this buffet quite highly. I feel compelled to add a review to possibly help others from wasting their time and money and so they can enjoy dinner elsewhere. As noted in other reviews, the setting is very nice. And I would give our waiter 5 stars (Milton was his name I think). Pretty much everything else was awful or average at best. My chair was used so much there was no more cushion in the seat and it was so wobbly I thought it might collapse.  I traded it with another chair at the table and it was in the same condition. Compared to other buffets, the number of food selections are limited. And that wouldn't be such a bad thing if the food was good -- it was poor. Wasn't all that tasty and much of what was supposed to be hot wasn't. The prime rib was the only item I found to be favorable. I was looking forward to excellent desserts and they were extremely disappointing as well. And yet the dinner line was so long that the wife and I opted to pay the additional $10 per person for the line pass and to be seated right away. We did the 24 hour buffet pass. Had breakfast and dinner next door at Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood. It was excellent. Vast selections that were fresh and tasty and the desserts put Village buffet to shame as well -- even their creme brulee was better. And if you like crab legs, while both buffets have them, at Spice Market you can have them hot or cold and the legs are already split for you. Likewise the shrimp are already peeled unlike Village. Oh...and if you like cleanliness you'll enjoy Spice Market more too. At Village they never cleaned the front of the buffet where food would be spilled or dropped. At Spice Market it was done on a continual basis.  If it wasn't for our waiter or the ambiance I would not have even rated this two stars.",

Boy, does she still need a lot of training!  The service was bad enough when the bus boy, Federico, came out to clear our table while we were still eating and was flat out rude.  He even tried to kick us out of the restaurant because, according to him, they had to go home.  When I asked him why he was telling us to leave when he wasn't saying anything to the people at the other tables around us, he just made a nasty remark, left, and called our server.  I made sure I got his name so I could report him to management.   What makes it sad is this is one of our favorite buffets in the Caesars Entertainment family of hotel/casinos in Las Vegas. Being a Total Rewards Diamond member, we do not have to wait in the long lines. We always try to have at least one dinner here whenever we're here in Vegas. We like the variety of foods they offer especially the crepes and the steamed crab legs.  We've always had great service here before that's why we were surprised to have such a horrible experience tonight.  The wait staff had always been great and very attentive. They even anticipated our needs a lot of times. That's why we love coming back.   I hope what happened here tonight was a fluke perpetrated by two incompetent, rude, obnoxious employees who do not deserve to be working in the service industry.  I hope that those employees get some kind of disciplinary action. I hope this is not an ongoing trend at Caesars Entertainment properties.",

In terms of the atmosphere, none of the wait staff was friendly, only half the food was labeled and the food that was labeled was labeled incorrectly.   On top of it all, our waitress wouldn't give us additional mimosas even though we supposedly paid for \"unlimited\" because she couldn't give us more than one glass each. Meanwhile, other tables were allowed full bottles of champagne. She went so far as to tell my friend she had to finish her glass before it could be refilled.   When we decided literally nothing was editable, we complained to the manager and without any hesitation at all he gave us a full refund which tells you just how often people must complain. The Paris hotel looks beautiful but the buffet should be shut down by the department of health.",

It is waaaaay too salty.",

    "text": "According to some list I read, this buffet regularly ranks in the top five in Vegas. Unfortunately, there's a really big gap between #1 (Bacchanal) and anywhere else. Like most buffets, this place has some solid dishes and a lot of fillers. Their gimmick, being in the Paris casino, is having French dishes. Unfortunately, buffet-quality French simply isn't that great.  HITS: chicken de Provence, truffle and veggie cavatappi pasta, prime rib was solid, eggs were cheesy as hell if you're into that sort of thing, crepe station, Sunday brunch includes champagne that is surprisingly good despite low retail price, limited dessert selection for  a place that's hyping up their French affiliation.  MISSES:  French onion soup is super salty dregs, pate at charcuterie area is not good, their entire sushi selection consists of literally a single crab maki roll, entirely too many breakfast options still out at 2PM, heated plates at dessert station lead to melted desserts.   SERVICE: They're busy, I get that. Hostess is inefficient, three groups of 6+ held up the line for half an hour until someone came up and figured out that pairs could be seated immediately and the line started moving again. Our server either had far too many tables or short term memory loss, served half our drink order then forgot the alcohol until we reminded her half an hour later (the next time we saw her).  Not the best buffet but certainly not the worst. Pricing is decent, but only if you like filling up on grilled meats and think a selection of  fancy breads makes you \"French\".",

I was amazed at their omelet sheet given at the table, pick your fillings and the server brings it to you when ready. I wish I came for dinner because I hear it's fabulous. The crepe station looked amazing I can't believe I skipped that. There's charcuterie and caprese salads, light to rich foods such as pastas and a carving station. The desserts were awesome and if you are going to make the drive to Cali right after, be sure to get some coffee and to go cups. =)",

Well speed to present day, WHOA, has it changed?!  The service is poor, the quality of the food is even worse.  Let me easily point out 2 things I found comical.  They had sushi,  1 type, the ones with a bunch of guords, the kind you would never eat or order.  #2, the title plate for Macaroons... Oh come on!  This is Paris Hotel, Le Village Buffet, they should know the difference between Macarons and Macaroons, and how to properly sandwich one... the puffy sides faces out!  However, for the 1 star, I will compliment the crepe bar.  I am not a big crepe person, but I was told it is not bad.  And you can make reservations 24 hours before.    In total skip it, for $60 (Groupon) + $10 parking fee, you should go to The Buffet at The Wynn Hotel, it would come out the same price, considering the parking is still free.",

On the negative (keeping me from giving it 5 stars), we had a party of 8, but paid separately. We did not realize that we should have told the cashier so they could include gratuity on our bill since there is a mandatory gratuity for parties of 7 or more. When it was time to be seated the hostess gave us a hard time and said we could not sit together since gratuity had not been included. We told her that we would be happy to leave the gratuity, but we definitely wanted to sit together or at tables near each other. The woman gave us a hard time and was unwilling to be flexible, so I told her to get the manager. Another hostess stepped in an took care of the situation for us. She was very friendly and made sure we were happy.",

Quality of food was passable but nothing extraordinary. I encountered 2 rude food service workers and 2 that provided great service. I understand that the theme here is Paris & they are trying to emulate French dishes but they really weren't well executed. However, this is a buffet and it's located on the strip. What more can you really expect? If you're hungry and want to fill your gut, give it a try but don't expect excellent food. I think there are much better choices in Vegas for the money though. The Orleans and Gold Coast Casino offers a better buffet for a fraction of the price. Get a B-Connected Card and you'll receive a discount on the price. There's a free shuttle to both hotels (both owned by Boyd Gaming-shuffle drops off at both casinos on same route) that has a pick up stop in the back of Harrahs and it runs about every 15 minutes.",

Smoky flavour -While the selection was not as extensive as other major buffets on the strip, it was a good size and the quality of the selection was good (for the most part) -Very good prime rib  What I didnt like: -Sushi selection and quality was poor - restaurant could do without this on their menu -Salad bar was small and wasnt very appealing",

We got seated and then went to get food and returned to a lady sitting at our table on the phone.  We had to ask her to leave which was awkward to say the least.    Service was slow and everything that should have been hot/warm was cold except the coffee.  For example, the tomato soup and chicken crepes were luke warm at best and we began eating as soon as we got our food.   The taste of many food items was highly disappointing as well.  Few items tasted really good which was not the case on our last few visits.  Also, there was prime rib but it was mostly fat and gristle and nearly raw.  Further we were never told (and didn't recall) that champagne or fresh juice was an option.  :(  We've been here several times and have always loved it but today will be our last time as the value proposition and poor service and unappealing cuisine makes it a poor choice for us.  One last critique for Paris...their self parking set up is a bloody nightmare.  Nobody can figure out how to use the pay system so we spent 15 min waiting and backing out and switching lanes because the people in front couldn't figure it out in two different lanes.  The system is not user friendly and causes unnecessary delays and frustration from guests.    Thanks for allowing me to share.",

I came here with my family, and we had made advanced reservations - lines are always super long for any of the buffets, and we were lucky enough to just enter without waiting for too long.  For some reason though, I feel that the hype of this place has died down considerably since being here 3-4 years ago.  Although there was a line, the dining room seemed pretty empty.  I notice that they reduced a number of their pastries and food items from previous years I've been here.  They really need to step up their game especially since there's a new buffet at Caesar's Palace.  I will say that the price is probably on the cheaper end in terms of LV buffets - I believe about $30 /person.  The food quality was just okay.  I wasn't blown away and can't really give more stars.  The other LV buffets take it to the next level.  I'm doubtful about coming back here, but the macaroons and crepes are pretty good!",

Line was not that long and we were seated in an area designed like a cottage. I really linked the scenery and atmosphere of Le Village, it was like we were in France!  The food was excellent! A good amount of variety and plenty of standout items such as the crepe, Eggs Benedict, smoked salmon, macaroons and flan. They also made omelets but I was too full to try it. By the end of the meal, we were all really full and enjoyed it.  This buffet is definitely one that I revisit when I'm in Vegas again!   My ranking of the buffets 1. Le Village Buffet (Paris) 2. Carnival World Buffet (Rio) 3. Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood) 4. Flavors the Buffet (Harrah's)  Didn't get to try the Paradise Garden Buffet at the Flamingo because we were too full!",

And my biggest pet peeve - all the food was luke warm, even the soup.  The variety was tiny, so much so that I actually found myself eating bread.  I've never eaten bread at any buffet ever.  The only good things about this buffet were that they had plenty of chilled crab legs, a crepe station, and a nice Parisian atmosphere.  For a similar price, I'd gladly recommend the Carnival World Buffet at the Rio or the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood.  For a higher price tag, the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace is hands down the best buffet in Vegas.",

Had lots of choices like chicken, turkeh, prime rib, as well as veggies and mashed potatoes and mac n cheese. Classic american buffet. My fave was the crepe station. Sort of a long line with one lady working the crepes and a variety of options but worth the wait.  Price - about $30-$40 a person which is expected of Vegas but the wait time takes forever! The hostess is very slow despite the amount if available tables.",

Be warned, there is a wait time to enter the buffet, but when you travel with friends who have VIP status, there is a seperate entrace with no wait time!  But that is not what makes this visit great for me, it is the food selection.  I really enjoyed the variety of foods offered than the typcial iceberg salads, roasted meats, bland treats. Nope, here at the Paris Hotel they offer speciality crepes made to order, speciality salads, pastas and parisian treats. I really love the uniqueness of their food selection. You must try the wine marinated fruit... its wonderful and not intoxicating with alcohol!",

The line was much shorter when the Jersey Boys show let out.  However, there was a server monopolizing one of the cashier's time (trying to cash out his tips or something?) and the free cashier was a trainee who didn't know how to ring things up.  Things eventually got sorted out.  The interior is absolutely gorgeous.  The faux French village vibe (think Disney's Beauty and the Beast) was really fun to see.  I mostly indulged in crab legs the entire time.  The crab was sweet, salty, pre-cracked, and perfectly cooked.  The creme brulee and creme caramel flan were excellent.  The bread pudding was underwhelming, as was the beef (prime rib I think, cannot remember what it was exactly).  The andouille sausage was not a winner for me, as it was super spicy.  The potatoes au gratin (scalloped potatoes) were undercooked, perhaps from being sliced too thick.  The mashed potatoes were great though.  The salmon was also quite tasty.  Beverage service was lacking, and my water glass went dry several times.",

Transported to a cute French country farmhouse looking out the doorway and window onto a sea of diners happily eating at a sidewalk cafe. We and other patrons shared a little house with folk from Japan and a delightful family of three; mother, grandmother and baby. We had a wonderful waitress that tended to our needs without ever having to ask because she was always attentive. Other staff cleared our tables and did everything possible for one of the best experiences so far at Le Buffet.To start, I consumed French onion soup, French bread and some cheese and I had died and gone far from where I was. Next course was Prime rib, mushrooms simmered in wine, delicate green beans, Yukon gold potatoes all were fabulous. Then I dabbled in a pasta dish with cream sauce, creamed spinach, and more of those mushrooms, but was getting extremely full. Switched my drink to coffee a carafe of piping hot coffee was placed on our table just by our simple request and boy was it good. Being stuffed didn't stop me at dessert, I selected a Chocolate covered Napoleon and Flan and was again truly impressed. My friend loved every bite and especially the custom made dessert crepe. We couldn't take our coffee cups out, but they brought us paper cups so we could take our coffee to the casino floor. Again a wonderful experience.",

Other items of beef and chicken and whatnot were entirely unpleasant and I couldn't believe that this was the same buffet that I enjoyed years ago.  I sat and sipped my coffee since the juice they served were either too sweet or just plain gross and at room temperature. Lunch rotation came and I stuck around.  The desserts were fun. I'm glad they came out. Those sort of helped to ease my disappointment. The food however wasn't much better. Sure a few items that came out were tasty as compared to breakfast, but still not worth the stomach ache.  I'm sorry, Le Village, but I will not be returning to your lovely buffet again. Your presentation is wonderful, but the price is not worth the coffee and dessert alone.  Adieu.",

    "text": "My favorite champagne brunch buffet on the Las Vegas Strip.  For $25, you get a French themed brunch options with plenty of other goodies.  I was rockin' the mimosas all throughout my meal with some amazing service.    My favorite items were (in no particular order): 1) handmade crepes with blueberries and cherries 2) pork sirloin rhubarb chutney with an apple glaze sauce (I had to go back for a lot more) 3) great variety of desserts from fruit tarts to creme brulee to flan to fancy cakes  Be aware that we did wait a good 45 minutes on a Sunday morning starting at 10:30AM so if you want less of a wait, it might be wise to get there a bit earlier.  Some people say the snow crab legs are so good and what not, but for the brunch time meal, I'd say they are less than desirable and there are many better options of things to eat.",

I'm not a total fan of buffets, but I do enjoy trying a little of everything.  I give Le Village a thumbs up for their:  -seafood: crab legs, mussels, shrimp, crawfish -desserts: creme brulee, chocolate tarts, cheesecake, mango mousse cake, cooked-to-order crepes (better quality/more variety than Bellagio) -reasonable prices -cute atmosphere",

They always have plenty of crab legs that are perfectly seasoned with an optional butter dipping sauce.  The decor is absolutely adorable and the ceiling is painted just like the casino with neverending blue skies.  The buffet resembles a cute little French town--kind of reminds me of the \"bonjour\" scene from \"Beauty and the Beast\".  The crepes and omelets are made to order.  The dessert station is located right in the center with tons of french pastries, cakes, and icecream.    I leave here resembling a rollie pollie with a full and happy tummy.  Food coma sets in pretty quickly and I usually head back to the hotel for a little siesta.",

I did not have a 15% tip fee added to my bill as I saw on a previous review.  The breakfast food was all pretty normal, but executed relatively well compared to the lunch dishes.  I ate a lot of eggs and smoked salmon.  Most of the best dishes were the simply prepared ones.  The beef roast (unsure of the cut) was delicious, as were the grilled vegetables and mozzarella/tomato/basil salad.    The more complex dishes I found to be inedible.  Mushroom risotto - the risotto was hard and clumpy (I make a better risotto than that!) and lacked a strong mushroom flavor.  The seafood stew was THE WORST.  The mussels WERE NOT DE-BEARDED!!  (FYI, the 'beard' of mussels are tough and fibrous and have a scratchy feel that makes me want to spit it out) I have never prepared or been served mussels that were not de-bearded.  The chicken alfredo pasta and basil pesto was the best of the pastas - the alfredo sauce was very garlicky, which I loved.  The roasted duck had a sweet fruity taste, which was unexpected.  And the coq au vin was made with chicken, and was decently flavorful, but I've definitely had better.  I won't be going back.",

It was $27.01 for a long wait in line, an assortment of only so/so food, and a very sporadic, unattentive waitress. I certainly didn't get my moneys worth of champagne! They didn't give us enough utensils as they must've forgotten about us since we felt crammed in the back.  I enjoyed the self-made mimosas and I'm always up for buffets. It just wasn't worth the money for what they were offering.  The King crab legs weren't so fresh and the food was nothing special.  What is the omelette station doing hiding in the dessert area? If you do go, this is the only items worth eating: Bacon, Sweet Crepes, Ravioli (spicy).  PASS. go to Rio's buffet instead.",

There were some really good items to be had such as the fresh made to order crepes - yum! The tortellini which was creamy and delish, the country potatoes, assortment of cheeses and fresh buns, and some tasty creme brulee. There was also a large selection of fresh fruits which I really enjoyed.   On the other hand, I found a lot of the proteins offered to not be too good. They have unlimited amounts of crab legs, but unfortunately as much as I like seafood, I have a hard time eating cold crab legs first thing in the morning so I was unable to enjoy that part of the Buffet.   The unlimited champagne is fabulous! Our server was a quite overworked and they seemed to be short staffed, but we still managed to have about 4 glasses of champagne each which was more than enough. All in all, this is a pretty solid choice for breakfast or brunch while in Vegas, specially if you enjoy champagne or mimosas with your meal.   Also, there are long lines to get in this place so be prepared for a wait of 30min +.",

I would have given them about four stars when I was younger, but once buffet of buffets stringed along...they deserve two stars. The quality of food definitely dwindled down.  First off, service here was excellent as always. Yes our waitress might not refill our apple juices very quickly, but I can't blame her for all the tables she had to deal with. I'm a reasonable person. =]  Second, I went during breakfast...I only enjoyed eating the \"build your own omelet\" and crepe station (they rush you, so the crepe is a bit soggy...not like Bacchanal Buffet...patience). The crab legs didn't taste that good either...not fresh. The carving station only had prime rib, ham, and sausage...however there was no one to slice the meat...so everything became dry. The dishes that they displayed didn't look very appetizing...so I didn't even try it. (Didn't want to get sick).  Lastly, I am sad to say that I wouldn't suggest coming here for breakfast. I haven't came here for awhile for dinner, but if I do...I'll update this...However, it may be awhile...I'm addicted to Bacchanal Buffet now =]  Note: Unlimited beer, mimosas, and wine for $12.99",

It really does give you that Paris feel, it has a magical vibe. Beyond that, this place is nothing more than mediocre and I think that's even a generous statement. The food selection is decent but I didn't find the quality to be too good. Some of the food was cold or appeared to be sitting out for a long time. Also, the service was very slow and sporadic. Its a buffet so you would think I would have little to no commentary on the service but you rely on them for beverages. It took the waitress a good ten minutes to greet us.....and I was thirsty and hung-over, I wanted my damn coffee and OJ! Vegas has tons of buffets to choose from so if this one crosses your path, skip right over it. I recommend Casears breakfast/brunch buffet, theres no comparison.",

We had plates and plates of those. No shame in our game! I'm not a shellfish kind of girl, but even I will admit that they were good. The steamed mussels and prime rib were really good as well. The quality and presentation of the food was spectacular. (Avoid the sushi they have in the corner; I know you did not just stand in line for over an hour to eat subar sushi!)  The dessert bar was amazing as well! They make the best creme brulee here, really! The pecan pie and frozen chocolate custard (with a sprinkle cone) are delicious too.

    "text": "I like Le Village Buffet.  I think it's a unique buffet with the French spin giving it a little different feel than others.  What I really like there is the crepe station.  I always get the mushroom crepe and it's delicious, but I have trouble eating anything big at a buffet so I always end up wasting it.  I need someone with me who also likes mushrooms!  I also love the cheese selection, although I thought the selection during this most recent  visit was a little too \"American\"... where was the brie?  I like unusual cheeses so would have liked more of that.  I kind of filled up on little salads and cheese and the crepe, but then of course, headed to the carving station for some Prime Rib and accompanied that with some cavatappi with cream and truffle and a couple types of roasted potatoes.  I was a little disappointed with the Prime Rib as it was a little overcooked... no pink to be seen, but it was still moist and fairly tender, so that was something.  Had trouble tracking down condiments and condiment containers which is a little frustrating, but the breads were yummy.  The worst part of the food is the desserts.  They are pretty weak unless you love macaroons, but they do sweet crepes at the crepe station, so if you still have room, that's a great option.  We got lucky on this visit and walked right into the main line without being in any switchbacks, yet it still took us a good 30 minutes before we got seated and they had a the whole back overflow area completely empty!  After we got in line, the switchbacks behind us filled up so on Monday night, apparently 7:15 is the time to arrive!    We were offered a complimentary glass of wine, which was cool, but we stuck to our sodas and other than that our waitress wasn't all that.  So service here was \"meh\", but we enjoyed our meal and I will go back.  We were on the Buffet of Buffets, so it was included in our buffets, but those paying were paying $33 for this dinner.  Also, I've been here for weekend brunch and it includes champagne, so that's not a bad deal even though you aren't getting Moet & Chandon.",

Food I liked the most were the pastas and a meat dish that was served in individual mini cast-irons. My favorite part though were the custom crepes... omggggg, I wish I had room for 2, but this place left me stuffed. I also love the decor, kind of similar to the real thing and really does look/feel like \"a village.\" Def recommend.",

Cobblestone floors w/ an outdoor dining theme & painted ceiling.   The wait wasn't too bad but there was indeed a line. I grabbed nothing but breakfast foods. From eggs to sausage, waffles, french toast, etc. It was all good, literally. They even had a drumstick machine! The graham cracker cone w/ chocolate filling was provided. All you have to do is choose from either vanilla or chocolate, both if you're in the mood & fill your cone up! Check this place out, & also look into getting their 24hr. backstage buffet pass for $45. You can eat at various other buffets from other casinos such as the Rio, Planet Hollywood, etc.",

    "text": "Umm. WOW. I've heard mixed reviews about Las Vegas buffets, but this buffet is no joke AWESOME! Lunch buffet is 20, incl tax. Bring cash to tip, because you pay for the buffet in advance. I will agree with other reviewers; the wait is a pain in my arse. However, it seems standard compared to the wait at other buffets on the Strip.  They have a lot of French dishes. I got to try ratatouille, or as my nephew call it, ratatooti. I also found out, I don't really like it. They have a small selection of breads (cranberry, garlic and basil, regular French bread) throughout the buffets. I love how they have plenty-a meats and vegetables. Their glazed sweet potato and green beans were so delectable and yummay! They have grilled bell- pepper, squash, hummus, red potatoes, brussel sprouts, broccoli florets, you know, the good shite.  The meats include beef, pork, lamb, chicken, fishies. There's also a small selection of (crappy) sushi, but I could care less for the sushi when there's plenty of other good foods abound.   The dessert selection is crazy. They have raspberry tarts, with 5-6 jumbo (and juicy) raspberries to top. They have creme brulee, flan, various cakes, banana foster, ice cream, cookies, ay yay yay!   The servers are cute little ladies dressed as provincial French maids. Fin.",

The au grautin potatos,, creamed spinach, and glazed carrots  were to die for.  The deserts on the strip easily cost $9, and are included with this buffet.  Don't forget the coffee, I own a coffee business and this coffee is wonderful.  I asked the waiter to see the bag, when i looked it up it cost over $60lb.  There is no skimping at this buffet.  There are many, many, choices.  But I am a prime rib person, and I am ashamed to say I had two helpings, it is just so darn good.  On a scale of 1 - 10 it is a 20.  I just wish it was in my hometown.  Now I will have to visit Vegas again just to come eat here.  p.s.  I did notice many patrons did not tip the waiters and waitresses, these people work very hard, and to not tip because it is a buffet is very, insulting.  Wow enjoy, we sure did.",

    "text": "I'm a big buffet fan, so naturally I got the Buffet Of Buffet's for my most recent trip to Vegas.  I had heard good things about this place and read the reviews here on yelp.  This was our first stop (for breakfast) and we were ready to eat!       We were seated quickly, there was no line.  Our hostess was a very kind woman.  The waitress wasn't all that great and really didn't do much other than get my party 1 refill (we were there for about an hour)  At first glance it seemed like a clean place, and I had hoped the food would be great.  Sadly...it was not.  My first plate was biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs, and hash browns.  I also grabbed a small bowl of oatmeal.    The overall quality of the food was really bad.  The eggs looked fantastic, however they had no flavor and they were very watered down.  The hash browns were cold, and again had no flavor.  I took one bite of the B&G and that was enough to know that I didn't like it.  The oatmeal I will admit though was pretty much as good as oatmeal can be.     I ordered Milk and I was very surprised that they brought me whole milk and that was pretty awesome, the waitress brought me 2 big glasses, I got a refill on 1 and ordered a chocolate milk, I was disappointed with the chocolate milk as that was not whole milk...it also tasted sour.  I went back to look at the other foods offered, and based off looks alone I wouldn't eat anything else from there other than fruit.  The bacon and sausage looked very undercooked, I have a thing about bacon being cooked crispy, this bacon was floppy and you could see through it, my girlfriend tried both meats and she said it was pretty bad.  I don't recall everything my lady had but she wasn't happy with it.   We left after that.   So for me, the only good thing about this buffet I liked was the Milk, Oatmeal, and Fruit.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at least not for breakfast, though if they can't make breakfast I can't depend on them to make anything else. I gave it a 2 for the way the place looked, and for the high quality milk.",

As we stood there waiting to be seated, we observed many empty tables. When we were finally sat, the set up for the dining room is very uninviting. We felt like we were placed in a back room.   The server took our drink order (water and lemonade) and didn't return with our drinks until we were done with our first plates (we had to ask her again for our beverages).   The choices of food are not presented well. And some of the items were labeled with expiration times. Very tacky.   However, the crepe station was incredible and delicious. And the crepe chef was extremely nice.   There are so many other better buffets in Vegas to dine at that are so much more worth your time and money.",

    "text": "I was all set to write this place off as completely over-rated, but I have to admit, this buffet is pretty darn good. Usually, the line for this buffet is ridiculous. My visit to Vegas this time was mid-week, and I was fortunate enough to choose a good time to chow down, as the line was a scant 20 people deep.  Pretty interior, lots of seating, interesting sections which gave you a feeling like there was inside seating and outside seating because of little 'rooms' within the seating area.   Plenty of choices to satisfy most cravings. Standard buffet fare and some non-standard selections as well. Most people gravitate to the crab legs at buffets, I'm more of a prime rib kinda gal. The prime rib here was pretty good. I admit, I grabbed some of the mushroom sauce meant for the Chateaubriand instead of the au jus. I think it was a good choice.   Other items I had were the brussel sprouts (don't judge me), kielbasa and sauerkraut, chicken with a wine/mushroom sauce. All very, very good. Desserts were plentiful. I tried a creme brulee and a puff thing that I have no idea what it was called but it was damn good.  I'm not sure I liked this buffet enough to pay the single visit price and wait in the usually long line. I had purchased the \"Buffet of Buffets\" deal, so it was worth it in this case.   The food is very good, service was great. As soon as I went up for dessert, a staff member came by and offered me coffee. It's like she read my mind. If you're a multiple plate buffet champ, it's probably worth the wait and the price. If you're like me and a 1-plate wonder, maybe spend your $30 elsewhere.",

The short bald man carving for me must have been furious for his shortcomings since every trip i took to get more he would give me less and less. The crepe station wasnt any better. The woman working until 1pm was obviously more intent on talking to her coworkers. She asked the person in front of me what they wanted three times. No joke. Once before she poured the batter, once more when she flipped the crepe and again before she filled it. I asked for a mushroom truffle crepe. She said huh?? Whats that. I repeated myself... And enunciated. When she still had no clue what i was talking about i told her the number. She was obviously rushing despite the lack of a line behind me. The crepe was raw and doughy so i only ate the mushrooms. I went back for a dessert crepe. When it came time for me to order she asked what i wanted and proceeded to start a conversation with a coworker who was standing there doing nothing. She asks me, \"What would you like sweetheart?\" A banana nutella crepe please. She continues her conversation with her coworker not seeming to have heard what i said. I literally told her 5 times. Banana nutella. She ends her conversation her coworker and asks again what id like. Having a mother who is hard of hearing i remained congenial and repeated myself and smiled. She starts throwing the crepe together and yells at a server \"que hora es?!\" and says, \"cinco minutos! Me voy a casa!\". She hands me a crepe still glistening with raw batter completely plain. Flabbergasted i just walked away and placed the crepe on a stack of dirty dishes and waited 5 minutes so she would go home and the next shift would start. The next employee was much more patient and actually made sure my crepe was cooked, topped it with powdered sugar, whipped cream and nutella all of which were absent previously. The manager of the buffet seemed to be doing nothing besides walk slowly and stand on the side lines doing nothing. Previously the employees would clear breakfast items away directly after the service ended. This was not the case this time; hashed browns and quiche sat on the line. We left around 2. Breakfast ended at 11. Health and safety laws permit that hot foods be kept at safe temperatures for 2 hours. The breakfast items were going on 3 hours hy the tike we left. This buffet went from 5 stars to 1. What a huge letdown",

They had a wide variety of dishes ranging from seafood (crab legs, salmon, mussels) to sausages, pasta dishes, duck, and prime rib.  \"Le Village\" strives to be a top-notch French restaurant, so you won't find standard American fare here (fried chicken, ribs, large salad bar, etc.).

Everyone knows Caesar's is supposed to be the best but this place also had a great reputation. Key word is had. Don't get me wrong, there are still lots of good things about it. But there were also some things that could stand serious improvement. First of all, the meats were not good, kinda dry and just bleh. If you are charging this kind of money, you better have mouth watering prime rib and roast beef to start. Also, some of the side dishes were bland and uninspired. Yes, there was alot to choose from and the atmosphere was nice but for the price they are charging, they need to do more. The highlight of the meal was dessert. Creme Brulee was out of this world as were some of the pastries. The Crepe station knocked it out of the park. It was just sooo good. But the highlight of a pricey meal should not be dessert. The rest of the meal has to stand up on it's own and this just didn't. That being said, it was still better than some of the other major buffets on the strip. I should mention that the service could also stand improvement. Everytime I needed my waitress I could not find her. The dirty dishes piled up and I literally had to get up to get someone's attention. That should simply not be.",

There is a station for toast but the jam is on the other side of the room. If you want cereal and milk, you can help yourself to the cereal but have to ask hour server to get you some milk. They had smoked salmon and nearby was a bowl labeled whipped cream cheese. It turned out to be whipped cream, a little sweet for the salmon. There was a lot to choose from and none of it looked or tasted very good.",

Cost me 25 bucks to get in I love the desert selection not many places has tiramisu so i was grubbing on that till the cows came home. King crab is always a plus If you get king crab at Red Lobster its very expensive. A lot of meat, i wish i could have stayed there longer but the champagne messed me up so we went back to the hotel and slept it off.",

We got to Paris and Le Village's line was soooo long, so we figured this place must be good.  We got there about 10:30am and we were too late for breakfast so we ended up getting \"Champagne Brunch\" for $24.99.  They were still serving breakfast but honestly, the hash brown patty reminded me of Mcdonald's hash brown patty but bigger.  The chicken was waaaaay salty, you know the already made ones from Ralphs or Albertsons?  Those ones are way more tastier than Le Village's!  The fish was bland but the crab was pretty good.  Tasted a day old but when you haven't crab in a while it tasted damn good.  I'd have to say the shrimp with the cocktail sauce was the best thing in the whole place.  Well..the soft serve ice cream was pretty bomb.",

I took a little quick drive across the parking lots from Wynn over to the Paris and splurged out on proteins at the Le Village again.  I spent most of my Saturday being hammered from 3-shot goose drinks, and I just needed something else that is not toxic liquid based.   I came down here, and the line was about 20-45 mins.. could be 60? I don't remember. All I remember is that the price was slightly jacked up for dinner at $24.95. Thats funny considering everything that was served was exactly the same as last time. Infact there was probably more baked goodies last time around then the lunch hour. Either ways, I m glad I came here instead of the over priced $39.95 Wynn buffet.   My favorite had to be their prime rib with au jux. I probably ate about $30 worth of meat with the 6 half pound slices I had. Then I had to try their creme burle. That is what being french and dinning french is all about. I had a few more cups of those.. I was full for a total of 4 hours until I got on the dance floor later that night.   Paris is your best economical Vegas buffet if you are looking to not splurge on seafood, but some real meat for men.",

They didn't like the food because they weren't used to French food... but I didn't even know that they served that much French food besides the crepe making. But yeah, I'm not sure sure on that either.  Anyways, I've been here for brunch and dinner on separate occasions and I'll just say that the food is pretty good. One time I remember filling up my plate so much and eating all of it. I like the crepes here and the omlets that the chefs make for you. The only bad thing is that there's always a line for this..but it's pretty worth it.  I ate here multiple times on different occasions using the 24 hour buffet pass. But yeah, it's a pretty good buffet compared to some other ones. Out of the 7 buffets that the buffet pass comes with, I say Le Village Buffet tops Emperor's Buffet in Imperial Palace and Lago Buffet in Caesar's.",

It's your standard buffet with some unique offerings (pate). Their service is consistent - they take away your plates promptly and your glass is never empty. (For breakfast, they leave you a carafe of coffee.)  But the best part about this buffet is the made to order crepes. They have some fruit at the station (usually blueberries, apples and peaches), but they'll make them with other stuff too. The well kept secret is that they'll make you a nutella crepe. Oh hells ya. Grab some strawberries or bananas from the fruit section first and then go over there and ask them to make your crepe with your fresh fruit. You can garnish with the whipped cream and slivered almonds or to be completely indulgent, they have a caramel sauce. My sweet tooth thanks this buffet for another great place to be indulged.",

We went for the Champagne Brunch and our ambition was to arrive early enough to pay the breakfast price and rollover into lunch/brunch, heh. but our intentions to wake up early in Vegas after a night out drinking was a poorly planned one. We arrived at 10ish, but the line was loooooong.  I believe we waited about an hour and got to the cashier just after brunch started so we paid the full $25 pp.   I think it's one of the prettiest dining areas for a buffet I've ever been to.  It's set to look like a lovely French village with painted skies, gardens and shops.  It really is quite quaint. and comfortable.   There was a nice variety of food.  The grilled veggie and meat station wasn't very good (meat was very dry), but the pastas, risotto, carved meats, and salads were reportedly delicious.  I wouldn't know.  I gorged myself on crab legs (they were salty and sweet and tender. yum!) and breads (yummy pretzel rolls and hard rolls).   They had a nice variety of desserts, the usual cakes and pies and icecream machine (but nice dipped cones with sprinkles and such) and mini creme brulees.  I was bad and took two creme brulees with the intention of only scraping off the very topmost crisp burnt sugar layer. :D",

The prime rib was probably the best thing I tried, nice and tender, but the thin slice I got didn't accentuate the cut of meat. The snow crab and shrimp (small) cocktail I usually splurge on weren't the best. Crab claws seemed over steamed as they were stuck in their shells.   They do have all the typical French fare like sole (overcooked), mussels (ok), duck (good), roasted chicken (better). Crawfish was rather fishy and didn't taste too fresh.  The selection of fruit was limited to cantaloupes, melon, and pineapple.  But where this place shines must be the pastries, which I'm not too big on so I can't comment on that. Come for dessert I guess.",

Le Village buffet is located in none other than the Paris hotel. If the name didn't already give it away, the buffet itself looks like a little French village. Food lines the walls all along the interior and in the center is an amazing dessert station.  The food is always delicious and fresh. There's something for everyone to enjoy. They offer a salad bar, crab legs with melted butter, prime rib, roast beef, veggies, sushi... I could go on forever. The mashed potatoes are to die for. It would be sacrilege if you went without trying them. But the kicker in this place is the fact that they make fresh crepes to your liking, right in front of you. Want it filled with bananas and strawberries? They have it. Blueberries? They've got that too. Cherries, chocolate sauce, caramel sauce, syrup, whipped cream, powdered sugar? Yes. ALL of that. It's oh so decadent and heavenly, eating one of these crepes should be a sin but I suppose gluttony comes in pretty close considering you can eat as much as you want. It doesn't matter though when everything's so good. Please eat here when you go to Vegas. If you don't, lie to me and say you did anyways.",

    "text": "Ah... \"all-you-can-eat\" buffets - the kryptonite in my efforts to eat healthy and well. You know you shouldn't do it but damn... it's too good and yes, sometimes you do regret it after a big belly overstuffed with food and you can barely walk. You feel awful and complain but then will do it all over again the next day.  OK... I do have to admit that I have self-control and I do not do buffets more than once a month. But heck, you're in Vegas... the city of excesses and for a foodie like me, this is heaven (and hell).  I'll be organized and break the review down to several key criteria;  Price: Don't recall how much I paid for it (mine and 3 of my dearest friends - I was feeling generous that evening!) but it wasn't cheap. Starve yourself that day and come prepared to splurge to get your money's worth. I'll give it a \"B\".  Layout: Any great buffet connoisseur knows that the layout of the food is pretty important. Take a walk around all food stations first to assess the game plan. Prioritize your favorite food and most expensive food (crab, lobster, etc) at the top of your list. To hell with the proper starters, soup/salad, main course, dessert order - you are in charge here! Anyway... I digress. The layout was a little confusing and I hate it when they don't provide a proper plan that outlines where everything is. Don't you hate it when you find another favorite dish but didn't see this station until you're way stuffed! Happened too often. I'll give it a \"C\".  Food: The most important of them all - it's good, at times excellent (snow crab legs - juicy, meaty and tasty) and on rare occasions, disappointing (blue crab - cold, dry and tasteless). The hot food section with prime rib, roast, etc were OK. I would have like more creative variations of the usual meats but it's usually a hard sell. Most folks like their meat familiar - yeah, you know who you are - the un-adventurous types. Boring! The desserts were pretty good with a decent selection and variety. I'll give it a \"B+\".  Service: It was spotty but when available, they were friendly. I asked for some nut-crackers to help with the snow crab legs but they didn't have any and provided some other utensils instead which didn't quite work as well. I'll give it a \"C\".  Decor: They are trying for a French cafe/street look and it sort of works. However, the tables and seats are a little too close together and the tables are relatively small. The place is also a little noisy and being seated amongst the food stations, there's lot of traffic around you. I'll give it a \"C+\".",

    "text": "One of the best buffets in Vegas.   I'll cut to the chase. The best part are the made to order crepes... and the warm chocolate sauce that you can put on them.. Yummy.  The crepe station usually doesn't have the chocolate sauce there, but if you trek over to the banna's foster station, it should be there.  They also have whipped creme, and powdered sugar.   I think they have this going ALL day.  The meats are ok, sometimes they'll have some good seasoned meat in the corner, sometimes it isn't there.  The rest of the stuff is honestly pretty standard stuff..    The crepes alone are worth the cost of this buffet if you like sweets. I can eat 2, maybe 3 fully loaded ones.  With a little meat, plus free beverage, it's worth it.    If you can arrive before the cut off time for lunch, or dinner, and get to the register to pay, you can stay later and get the better food for cheaper..   The line can get VERY long at times..  They don't have rack of lamb, and the carving station has been mediocre lately. (For dinner)",

You're way better off spending a few more bucks to go to the Bellagio buffet.  There is something very depressing about the lighting of this faux village. It is like perma dusk, but ugly. The limited food options do not make up for the environment. Among the offenses:  - This place promotes its crepe bar, but it shouldn't. Le Village Buffet managed to do the impossible: It ruined Nutella. They slather on way too much Nutella for their crepes. There are no fresh fruit options available. My friend took a banana from another part of the buffet, cut it up and asked them to put the banana in a Nutella crepe. They didn't understand this and instead put banana inside and Nutella outside.  - The only real seafood option was tiny shrimp that looked like it came from a freezer bag. You also had to shell the shrimp yourself.  - Things like broccoli and tortellini were dry and undercooked. Even the pears -- something that requires no cooking, just putting out for people to take -- were so unripe they were inedible.",

    "text": "First buffet I had upon arriving in Sin City.  Keep in mind I am reviewing their breakfast buffet, which was pretty mediocre at best.  The selection was very scarce...I am a person who enjoys variety, and there was not much to choose from during breakfast.  I got in line for the crepes with pretty high expectations, thinking that since this is a breakfast buffet in a Parisian themed hotel and casino, their crepes should be pretty awesome.  But no, I was only met with disappointment after waiting in line for 15 minutes.  I could not believe that a Parisian  themed buffet could not afford FRESH fruits for their crepes.  Are you kidding me?  They were using strawberries soaked in what was probably high fructose oh-so-bad-for-you syrup!  Even the bananas and blueberries were swimming in some kind of syrup.  I ended up only eating about three bites of the entire thing.  What a waste of my time.  Some other things I ate:  - Eggs Benedict: These were the only highlight of my entire breakfast.  They were pretty good, so I ate two. - Prime Rib: I've had better. It was very bland and lacking flavor. - Roasted Beer: I thought this tasted better than the prim rib.  It was nicely seasoned. - Spinach and Cheese Quiche: BLEGH! It was so disgusting and hard when it should've had a nice and flaky crust!  I took one bite and had to force it down my throat.  I wish they had a better selection of desserts and sweet pastries, considering it IS a Parisian breakfast.  Maybe I should've gone here for dinner so that I could've tried the amazing Creme Brulee that everyone raves about.  I am a huge sucker for desserts and have a major sweet tooth.  (LOVEEE Creme Brulee!)  Oh, woe is me!",

    "text": "The wait time was acceptable. Was told it was about 1.5 hours but really only took about 45 minutes. It all depends on often people leave. They offered bottomless drinks for an additional fee. There was a table that was sitting next to us that had already finished eating and was drinking and socializing for the 1.5 hours we were there. That's probably why the wait times there are long. But honestly any buffet in Vegas your going to wait a minimum of 30 minutes. If it's quicker are you sure you really want to eat there? We also ended up having three different servers while we were there so the first two did not receive a tip because they were already gone by the time we left. It's like they changed them every hour or so. I would recommend giving the servers that bring you your drinks a few bucks each time they come to your table much like the servers while you are gambling at the tables. The best part of the buffet was the deserts! They were absolutely amazing! And I'm not really a desert person. I wish I did not eat so much during dinner. I was surprised that there was no Creme brulee. They do change their deserts often so maybe we just missed them. I would go back here again.",

    "text": "You'll first notice the huge hour plus line while walking through the Paris hotel. If you're good with waiting, you'll be presented with a decidedly French themed buffet.  What I liked most is that you can get a crepe made in front of you. You'll get a choice between three types, cherry, blueberry and a fruit of the day. I'm a big fan of the cherry variety, so I ordered that. They also have a dark cherry topping you can add along with hazelnut bits. There is a large salad bar area and a slightly smaller dessert section.  I think there might be better options when waiting in line this long for a buffet in Las Vegas. If you like French themed food like crepes, there are a couple of other good dishes here too. Thanks to Caesar's Entertainment Corp for supplying me with a buffet wristband to test a few out.  I would like to try the Champagne Brunch, as others have suggested, which might add an extra star to this buffet.",

When we left the lunch line was looong!    The restaurant looks small but it is pretty big with different stations.  The breakfast selection was good and many options to choose from, not only is there different options but there are varieties of each option - example - different types of scrambled eggs and hash browns.  I had a good experience and the server was attentive.  ************************ We liked this buffet so much from our BoB we decided to try it out one more time before we leave, this time it was lunch time.  There were a lot of different pastas and meats.  I think lunch is a couple bucks more but I think the breakfast buffet is better.  There was a crepe station where one had a crepe made on the spot with the toppings available - the line was always long. Went once just to try it out, it was okay.  The custard was delicious!  We wanted to try a small dessert before leaving and rather than getting a pastry we went to the ice cream cones and ice cream, except it was not ice cream it was custard - and it was delicious!",

Good if you're a duck fan (confit and a l'orange) and seafood lover.  Also, you get some grilled whitefish and heated crab legs if you're diamond player.

The quality of the food was mediocre, but what I found more disturbing was just the overall hygiene of the place.  All of the food stations were a mess, food dropped everywhere and no one was cleaning it up.  There was food on the floor that people were slipping on!  The prime rib was so tough that it was difficult to chew.  The one major highlight was the crepe station but, the crepes that the customers were eating across the street looked a lot better.  Needless to say, it was utterly disappointing.  Personally, I would spend a little more and eat at the Bellagio or Wynn.  Overall, it can be best described as the gourmet Hometown Buffet.  The decor is nice b/c it is supposed to make you feel like you are eating in an outdoor cafe.  My friends who ate with us remarked at how much the quality has dropped since they came here several years ago.  It may be due to the recession or being part of the Buffet of Buffet ticket.",

We told them to split us up as I'm sorry but I am getting my own food and you are bringing me drinks and supposed to be picking up our plates which did not happen once. It's like once we decided to split they were not Happy and wrote a big SPLIT on our Check and each waitress said oh their a split and made sure we were in 2 different rooms far apart from each other when there was plenty of room in our room and other people came in so they still had other party of fives in there. They were not friendly and although the food was good and had a good variety we will not be returning due to the poor customer service and horrible attitude of the staff. The other 3 buffets split us no problem and still sat us by each other and guess what we left a good tip. I mean we brought 10 people to your buffet but I refuse to be forced into a set gratuity for not doing anything. If it were a regular restaurant then I would understand the gratuity as they are working their butts off to provide service. It was ridiculous and uncalled for and I have to say the selection and service at the spice market were awesome and they were packed and still did an awesome job!",

    "text": "The food was good.  This was the first of three buffets we went to while in Vegas (others were Wynn and Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, both better than Le Village).  We were there at lunchtime.  There is a wide variety of food, but not as much selection as some other buffets.  However, the price was about $10 cheaper than the other buffets per person, so that makes a difference.  The whole place is rather dark, which is unfortunate, because Paris is such a beautiful hotel with all its likeness to the buildings and cafes of the city.   The waitstaff is friendly, but not as refined as that in other buffets.  It kind of seems like typical diner waitresses instead of a fancy place.  The lady making crepes had no teeth and was probably 80 years old, and I wondered if she was an authentic Parisian crepe professional. This was the only buffet we went to that had crab legs, and I love king crab legs.  They were delicious.  So if you're into king crab but don't want to pay $100 for buffet, then come to Le Village.  I had about 20 of them, which didn't leave much room for other stuff, but I did manage more: shrimp cocktail (shell still on), a nutella crepe (freshly made for you), chocolate lollipops, among other things.  My husband had the prime rib at all three buffets and preferred the one here at Le Village, saying it was tastiest.  So if you're into meat, that's another plus.  Also the sausage and andouille were excellent.  So were the cheeses. I vote yes when it comes to Le Village, though it is not a spectacle, and it does not have the selection of other buffets.",

The selection of food was not as good as the pricier buffets, but we still found a few things we enjoyed. The best meat dish was this braised beef - the meat was off the bones tender. Paired with the leek mashed potato and an assortment of grilled veggies, the braised beef made a delicious entree. As for the other savory items, we sampled a little of everything, but nothing stood out. I was disappointed at first that the crepe station did not have banana and nutella for the day, but ended up enjoying the fresh blueberry crepe drizzled with apricot sauce in the end. I would definitely try this combination again. The creme brulee was as good as everyone said-the BF and I practically inhaled a plate of these creamy dessert.  Overall, I might come back again foe breakfast or brunch. For dinner, you can get much higher quality and more variety at other buffets.",

I got a crepe filled with strawberries drizzled with chocolate sauce and my husband chose one filled with apples and strawberries with caramel sauce.  They were amazing.  I wasn't as impressed with their pastry selection - I was expected a little bit more from a French style buffet, but the few pastries we did try were delicious, especially the bear claw.  There were some interesting choices of food such as pate, but we were too full to try! Good buffet!",

I just pick a little bit of each stuff and sample it. Eventually I was already kind of full when lunch came around.  For breakfast I enjoyed the crepes (mix fruit), this cheese omelette looking thing, and their hash browns. I know not much.  Lunch...I love their pasta! I enjoyed the veal ribs. They use to serve crab legs for lunch (5 years ago?) but not anymore. Dessert was good, I love the chocolate mousse looking thing that comes in a little plastic cup.   Inside decorations are beautiful. It's kind of an outdoor scene, with buildings surrounding you. I enjoyed it but my mom said she felt 'stuffy' in there.   Only complaint...the bathroom has exactly ONE toilet.",

After reading the reviews and tips on here we thought we would try the \"arrive just when lunch is changing to dinner\" and pay the lunch price and get the dinner items. We won't do that again and we should have known better, that's what you get for being cheap! The lunch was pretty much over and many of the dishes were empty and dinner items were not brought out until an hour or so after the dinner price/time began. But if we had gotten there and paid the dinner price when dinner was supposed to start I'd have been upset. What was out was not good.",

The pasta was bland and the deserts looked better than they tasted. The creme brulee was not the creme de la creme.

Reading the reviews, was kind of mixed on whether we would enjoy this or not, but it was a pleasant surprise. Granted it was our one and only trip to a buffet in Vegas, but super pleased with it. Had pretty much anything you could want and it was all delicious. We got the brunch, so it was unlimited Mimosas (hey I'm a southern lady, love Mimosas ;)  The prime rib was excellent. Also they had a crepe station and you could either pick from their menu or just tell the guy making them what you would like on yours. They were delicious. Oh and for the price compared to the other places, we were really happy with our choice. It seemed \"cheap\" compared to the other hotels, but there was nothing cheap about the quality, quantity or flavor of the food.",

So we gave this place a try after looking at the reviews on yelp. I'd like to say it is far from tasty and doesn't have a great selection of food. I only ate 2 plates worth of food, which I was disappointed I wasted. The first plate consisted of Prime Rib, Mashed Potatoes, and cream spinach. The prime rib was extremely well done. (Rubber)... mashed potatoes were mediocre... cream spinach was alright. I thought they served a wide selection of drinks(All You Can Drink) but came to know that they only serve Miller Beer, Champagne, and Wine. The 2nd plate was Crab and Mussels. The crab legs were tiny and the mussels were not the best. They did not have a wide selection of desserts and what they did have was unappetizing. I am an honest reviewer and I only give 5 stars to restaurants that deserve it. I might give this place a try if they change a lot. Next time I will definitely go to the Wynn Buffet its about 110.00 for two, but is the best in Vegas.",

First off, the prime rib was real tasty , they even had the Canard a l'Orange that tasted exactly like the one I had when I was in Paris (France , not vegas). The selections were great and everything was tasty.  I can go on and on about how great the food was (maybe because I love french food) but the dessert was THE main event for me.  2 things : the crepe station and the creme brulee  The crepe station was amazing since you can pretty much think of what ever crepe you want, and they will make it for you and you can come back for more.  Now for the creme brulee , the fact that you can eat as much creme brulee as you want makes the price more than worth it.",

Some of the choices seemed not-so-good, but I remembered this buffet as being halfway decent when I had tried it years and years ago.   The line was much shorter than on my first trip. I remember about 8-9 years ago, the line went out the door almost into the casino. This time, there were maybe 15-25 people ahead of us. They were a little slow with seating, but nothing outrageous.   The food? Pretty good. I'd say the quality is fairly good, but the selection is a bit lower than my favorite (Bellagio), but still, you are presented with a pretty impressive spread. Then again, I just need a few staples done well with a few flourishes and I'm pretty happy. I'm fairly gluttonous at all-you-can-eat buffet set ups, and I was able to eat my fill. I think of everything I tried, there was only one thing that I didn't really enjoy.   TL;DR: it's one of the cheaper buffets on the strip, the line wasn't ridiculous, you can get it as part of a package deal. Fairly good food if you just want a few staple items to shovel into your face.",

    "text": "Le Village was the first buffet we went to on the 'buffet of buffets' package. Overall, the food is really great, considering its buffet nature, and the made-to-order stations are awesome.  Particularly we liked the crepe station as well as the meat carving stations. We liked it so much, we ended up having a breakfast, a lunch and a dinner at the place, which was coincidentally right below our hotel room.   Other choice things to look out for include, - Breakfast omelet -- tasty and made fresh. We did not even experience a long line at the station! - Braised duck. Does more need to be said? - Meat carving stations. Delicious, and the meat tastes as if brined so it has a wonderfully salty flavor throughout.  - Pastas. Surprisingly, these are not a waste of time.  We thought the atmosphere, while completely fake, was charming. The restaurant is in a kind of perpetual dusk, no matter the time of day. The staff were always very nice and helpful.",

You can pig out on the most delicious French foods that you can't find at home (or at least I can't). The decor is exceptional - with the fake buildings and bright blue sky above you, you feel like you're outdoors in the streets of Paris. They also have a huge variety of desserts. We tried every one of them.",

    "text": "I went there for the lunch buffet this time. There were some good options at this buffet. The seaweed salad was tasty, but the sushi was lackluster. They didn't have any chopsticks, either, which is odd for serving that kind of food. The cheddar cheese was very good, and the havarti was decent. The beef tips were tender and juicy, a good choice. The pork belly with apples was also a win. I was very happy to find a variety of vegetables because I bought the Buffet of Buffets pass, so this was the third buffet I had been to in that time period, and the vegetable options had seemed to be limited at some of the other buffets. The brussel sprouts were tender and buttery, but not overcooked. The asparagus, carrots and broccoli were equally as delicious, as were the fingerling potatoes. With the desserts, my absolute favorite was the raspberry topped cheesecake. It was the perfect balance of light creaminess with the fruity topping adding sweetness to the savory. Their chocolate cake was also tasty. They have a good variety of sugar free options, too, but I didn't get any.  The staff in there are friendly enough, but some of them aren't worried about helping someone not in their section. They'd rather hurry right by you and not stop and take a moment to see what you need. I had breakfast here last year and got a crepe, which I enjoyed. I thought they had a good breakfast buffet, and I liked it better than the lunch. I don't know what I'd expect from the dinner buffet from them, though.  It's worth a go with the Buffet of Buffets pass, but I don't know if I'd purchase a way in on its own.",

Also, random, but they had sushi during the lunch service. Good sushi though!  Be prepared to stand in line. Know that in Vegas, people tend to start their days late. So, if you don't want to stand in line---WAKE UP EARLY.  But seriously, this place is pretty awesome.  P.S TRI TIP!!!!",

Unbelievable breads, creative dishes like apples and pork belly (SO GOOD), and this pasta I could eat for every meal and just love. All these things would give it 4 stars but then the CREPE! Omg the apple crepe is literally to die for. Find room for it. Highly recommend - and I've eaten at all the major buffets on the strip.",

    "text": "After walking around the Paris and seeing how charming the \"Le Village\" buffet's picturesque decor was we decided to go there for breakfast the next day. It was the worst buffet experience I have had in Las Vegas. I waited in line for about 20 minutes for a crepe. There were 7 people in front of me. The crepe chef was painfully slow and inexperienced. When I got my strawberry and ricotta crepe, I went back to my table, cut into it and discovered that the strawberry filling was frozen. The strawberries were rock hard frozen. The \"ricotta\" topping was mostly cool whip. I went to the fresh fruit table and picked up a strawberry that was covered with green mold. Moved on to the nearby cheeses. Smoked Gouda pasteurized processed cheese food slices. Cheddar. Pepper jack. Not a single French cheese to be found. The croissants were dry and stale. The baguettes tasted like they came from a poor quality super market. I just gave up in disgust. It really was a charming ambience. I really wanted to like this buffet. But the quality of the food was abysmal. Such an insult to the culinary culture of France. If you want a buffet with good French pastries, breads, and cheese, go to across the Blvd to Bellagio",

I'm not sure if it was because we came around brunch (11 AM), or it was just the day of the week (Thurs) but we were quite disappointed with the selection, as well as the freshness of the food, especially coming from the French! We got mostly breakfast/brunch food, but they were swapping out the food as we were starting. They had a lot of breakfast foods like sausage, benedict, crepes, fruit, cheese, most of the standard stuff. As they were bringing in more of the lunch items (paella, prime rib, shrimp) we switched to those items but weren't very impressed with what we got. A lot of the dishes were dry or bland, not very tasty at all.  The best part was the dessert, which consisted of some flan, macrons, custard, and ice cream, among the array of cakes. It's not a terrible price ~ $30 after taxes and tip, but if we were closer to Rio we would go somewhere else instead. Definitely will try somewhere else next time.",

The first time I went here several year ago, I was blown away by the unusual and elegant selection. Now, not so much. I think it's time for a reboot. So if you're on the strip, spend your hard earned bucks at Cesars, Bellagio, or Wynn. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",

Maybe they were aiming for a solely French experience?  Roast was dry.  No pasta station.  They didn't even have the pre-requisite Vegas buffet item - pizza.  The food was old - even an hour after the menu was swapped to dinner only an hour ag  Cleanup attendants walked past twice and didn't bat an eye - their stations were empty.  They were pushing around empty cleanup carts for 5 minutes.    Our waitress Roxanne was exceptional even if she was tending to way too many tables on her own.  This place doesn't make sense - for all the French accoutrements and decor, you'd think it would have a menu to match.  Not so.  Harrah's bought Paris. It's gone downhill since.  This is a place to avoid.  Don't be fooled by the Groupon deal for 2 - not worth the $64 we spent.  Roxanne sent the manager over and we spoke with Cindy, who invited us back for breakfast- not brunch.  We'll review again if we decide to come back.",

Since we didn't tell the people at the register that we were a party of 9 they couldn't seat us together or in the same section. They would have to separate us per ticket. Seriously?!?!   First they took the party of 4. Sat us far out away from the other 5. This was the \"Best\" that they could do for not being aware. There were many empty tables but they went out of their way to make sure our group.   The birthday girl was fed up and asked to speak to the manager. Instead of just calling. She (I didn't get her name) just gave total attitude and mimicked the Birthday girls request. She called someone on the radio and walked away.   This is where Nina stepped in. Nina was the second lady working on seating people. She wasn't crazy about anything that had been going on. She gave us attitude as we're but she came through in the end. Nina actually showed some compassion. She was finally willing to sit us together as a group.   We were finally able to start our birthday celebration!  Our waitress was absolutely amazing!

We thought it would be nice because of the location in the Paris, however, it was the worst place we've eaten in Vegas. First, you get charged and leave a tip on your ticket when you arrive only to find out that have to get your own drinks and once in a while, there is a staff member to clear up any dishes. There were no dinner plates available. We were told to wait for the dishwasher. We used salad plates the while time. The crab legs were picked over, the other food was not good and the dessert area should be shut down.  There was even a bowl of apples and oranges at the dessert station. I've never wanted to peel an orange at a buffet! Anyway, don't waste your time and money. There are way better places to eat!",

As with most of the hotel/casino buffets, all of it was edible, but very little of it was mesmerizing. It's a typical buffet.  The variety is good and the atmosphere is quite nice, Howe the flow of the restaurant is a bit crowded.   Likes: my favorite and a must try was the smoked trout, sausage links, and bear claws. I didn't try the omelette, but they looked great.   Dislikes: the crepe station was such a let down. We got the berry crepe with cream. There was so much cream put on it that you couldn't taste anything else. The cream was also full fat cream and actually made me gag. The crepe shell itself has a traditional crepe flavor, the berries and cream were just a bit off putting. The eggs Benedict hollandaise sauce was made out of mayonnaise and therefore was disappointing in flavor. The food was also behind low glass dividers which made you have to bed down and reach under to get the food in the back.   Overall I would go to a good diner and get custom made food. The variety did not make up for the lack of flavor.",

It costs a little more than the other places, but the food is much better IMO, and worth a visit at least once while you're in Vegas. The food was good for the most part here(only a few very minor misses food-wise), and my favorite part was definitely the station where you could order 8 selections of crepes(4 savory, 4 sweet). Macarons(sp?) also weren't bad, either. Cool interior faux-French and European style interior, as well.  We got here not long after it opened on a February weekday, and the line wasn't too bad to enter. I imagine it can get really long and bad at times to get inside and eat, though.  4.5 stars.",

At first glance, it seemed to be full of great choices & we couldn't wait to make it to the great looking dessert station. We tried a lot of different things. The pesto pasta salad was the most memorable thing I got. Everything else was just ok or not good. Many things weren't flavored well or weren't at the right temperature. We pushed our plates aside to make our way to the lovely looking desserts. We piled on the sweets so we could sample most everything. The only good things were the peanut butter cookies & the apple torte crumble. Everything else was disappointing to say the least. Everything that should have been cold, like the cheesecake, was room temp or slightly warm. The macaroons the just plain nasty. I literally had to spit mine out. It tasted like badly burned coffee with a chewy texture. This place was a total waste of $60+. Only reason for 2 stars is that we didn't get food poisoning.",

They have make your own omelettes and sweet/savory crepes. There are regular scrambled eggs and egg whites. The usually toast, bagels, pancakes, french toast, bacon, and sausages. They serve bacon slabs at the carving area which taste way better than regular bacon.   The service is superb.   The lighting for breakfast is really dim.

Tried a bite of my sisters macaroons the red and green (red filling tasted like fluff). (Green was coffee). So good!   My hubby & grandma were bragging on the prime rib (apparently to die for) Will definitely be back here!  .",

The staff is very friendly (especially that gentleman that was doing the carvery early in the morning - A super friendly black guy).  He was super nice and deserved a tip, but he doesnt have a tipping bowl.    The crepe and omlette in the morning have tipping bowls, and if I don't tip I get the most rudest and mean service for getting one of them ever.  I mean, for something like an omelette or crepe where they're just doing their job, I don't see why I would tip.  I'm glad to tip for people who provide me with service and give me a smile regardless, then I go back to tip... but out of all buffets, this is the only place that literally has gigantic tip bowls and they expect you to tip (not like you've already paid for the buffet and need to tip the server as well).  Shady to me, also the service if you don't tip is offensive!  Anyways, the food is okay, and the crepes are okay as well..",

Faux French chateau lined the walls with trees that looked like birds could fly out, sit on your finger and sing a lullybye with you.  However, all that Cinderella animation sing-a-long came crashing down when I started eating the breakfast buffet.  Here's my bad experience list: 1) coffee - wasn't strong enough and they served the cream in a plastic cup.  How tacky is that? 2) After getting every egg dish out there, I needed my ketchup and hot sauce.  The server never looked our way, never checked on us, and was not able to see my waves of desperation.  Unfortunately, I swiped the bottles away from another table, after the couple left.  Sigh... 3)  Every egg dish was bad.  Lox scrambled eggs tasted like rotten salmon fishy runny eggs.  Scrambled eggs was just mush.  Eggs Benedict was hard as heck and the hollandaise sauce was not flavorful.  Ham and cheese omlets - bleh again! 4) Every potato dish was bad.  Hash browns was dry.  Square hash brown was super hard and super dry.  Sliced potato fries was just greasy. 5) Corn beef hash - wow, this a big ol' greasy spoon  Okay side: 6) Bacon - I guess you can't really go wrong with this one 7) Waffle and maple syrup - it was warm and the syrup was okay  Good!: 8) Sour dough toast with strawberry jam  To top things off, I was never able to get my server to provide me with water.  I was stuck drinking washed out coffee.  I had higher expectations from Paris and it failed me.",

This place used to be on the elite end of buffets a while back alongside Bellagio, but they too have joined the ranks of mediocrity.  The prime rib was overdone and nothing special (buffet at Aria still has the best buffet prime rib).  The highlight of the meal would be the crepe station at the end, but forget getting a \"savory\" crepe that would have cheese meat and veggies as the lady cooking the crepe is in such a rush to get your crepe done and go on to the next, that the cheese inside the crepe hasn't melted even 1%...it's like eating a fork full of shredded cheese out of a bag at the supermarket...so go for the sweet crepe for dessert and skip the savory as any part of your meal.  Everything else wasn't worth mentioning.   The ambiance is nice but the food has really slipped. I would kick myself for paying full price.",

It was the most miserable feeling with every bite of food I had to take in. No chance of getting back nor recommending this place to  anyone ever. The servers or the one that we got her name is Sue seem to not care at all, no tip for this one. Very bad place to eat at. Should've trusted my gut on this one. Bring a bottle of tums or any antacids if u want to go eat here. Or if you're constipated u might want to eat here coz their food will make u want to have a loose bowel movement. SMH",

    "text": "My friends and I visited the Le Village Buffet twice, once for dinner and the second was for breakfast, due in part because we purchased the Buffet of Buffets pass. After reading some tips in regards to the buffet of buffets my friends and I decided that the Le Village Buffet and the Spice Market Buffet were the only 2 buffets worth visiting.   The Le Village Buffet definitely feels like a Vegas buffet. The interior resembles a small French village that successfully makes you believe that you've been transported to another country, but that is as French as it gets. Once you see the entrees offered you'll realize that the Le Village Buffet is just like any other Vegas buffet, with the exception of a full packed crepe station. Luckily the food at the Le Village Buffet is cooked very well.  Breakfast: When we came for breakfast, my friends and I were excited to try some authentic crepes. Unfortunately the majority of the crepes offered were a let down. I tried a berry filled crepe, a banana nutella crepe, a ham and cheese crepe, and lastly a green onion chicken crepe. Out of the 4 the best was the banana nutella crepe and my least favorite was the green onion chicken crepe (I'd actually recommend not even ordering the green onion chicken crepe).  The other breakfast items offered were delicious. I strongly recommend grabbing an eggs benedict, (the hollandaise sauce was light but not overpowering, unlike the Spice Markets benedict which was unappetizing, due to the strong mayonaise taste), the carved ham was cooked to perfection, and the maple syrup polenta was simply too good. I'd avoid the bacon slab, which is basically a large thick cut of bacon; there was just too much fat and it was way too salty.   Dinner: Just a FYI, there's literally no special French entrees, so just keep that in mind when coming here for dinner. Overall the dinner items offered are very good. There's a good variety of selections, with the carving station being the highlight. The prime rib was moist and tender, and topping it off with some aju only made it better. I'd stay away from the crab legs though, they didn't seem very fresh and one of my friends actually left a little sick. Other than that the rest of dinner items offered were quite good.  Overall I'd definitely come back to Le Village Buffet, and if I do get the buffet of buffets pass again then I'll probably visit only this buffet, unless you purchase the premium buffets.  To good eatings :)",

The selection is not as vast as I envisioned, but there was a lot to choose from.  We made about 3 or 4 rounds, and I was ready to roll out of there afterward.  I really can't remember what I grabbed - some salad, some meats, roasted veggies, more meat, crab legs (pre split for your convenience!), crepes, ice cream, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!  Most of the food was good, fresh and well prepared.  I had a small serving of roast beef that was a little dry.  Service was kinda slow - we had to wave down our server to get refills on drinks and our plates weren't taken away as fast as we would have liked them to.  I don't think I'll be returning to this buffet, but I'm glad I finally got to eat hear - crossing it off my Vegas Eats list!",

They served sausages that compares to what you would buy at 7 eleven.  This buffet was so bad by far that I took 5 hours just to drive there to have the biggest disappointment of the year.

    "text": "As a proud glutton, here's a tip: come for breakfast at 10:15am and you can stay for lunch.  When I go on a trip, first and foremost, I need to know that my tummy is going to be taken care of. I don't give a hoot about scenery, I just want to eat. Maybe it's the Filipino in me, but I need breakfast, snack, lunck, snack, dinner and then after maybe something to tide me over till bedtime. Buffet of Buffets takes care of that and this is our first stop.   We line up around 10am and it takes about 20 mins to get to the cashier. It's like Disneyland: you wait in line and just when you think you're inside, there's another snake-y line. So we pay and since I have a Total Rewards Card, a) it's cheaper by like $5 and b) I don't get to wear a bracelet all the live long day... you see this, you think it's for a club... no, it's for a buffet... ahahaaa...  Our server is such a nice guy. So happy, so full of life... totally happy to help us get enough coffee, juice, pop (for me) and water... it must have been because he was off soon because another woman who looked really unhappy became our server. Still brought us our stuff, but I felt bad asking her.  I started out with bacon and sausage... I picked up some macaron-y looking things and some yogurt with mangoes. Obviously, the meat was good. Who can screw up bacon? The macaron-y things were wonderful. I got two to start in case they were weird, but they were really crispy chewy with lemon curd in the middle. The mangoes were under ripe. My only complaint. Why can't I find good mango anywhere? Before breakfast was over, I ran and made sure I got a biscuit with country gravy. You wanna do this right? Get a bowl from the yogurt area to allow for maximum gravy on your biscuit without getting it all over your macarons.  Then, the change over! Like a mad dash, all the people in the restaurant clamor to get in line. I have a slice of prime rib. Wow. The meat is cooked to my liking- rare and it's so tender. To go with that, I get some of the truffle mac and cheese. I wish I had gotten more. It's so creamy and the flavour is dare I say, AMAZING! So good. I've googled how to make it, but I don't even want to attempt in case I sully the good memory of this mac and cheese. Of course, I grab more desserts, but this time it's two creme brulees. The sugar was crackly... sometimes at buffets, the tops can be sub-par, but not here.   Yum!",

Best way to start off the morning, we all then split up and got some grub. The prime rib was delicious and the eggs Benedict wasn't the best I ever had so I barely touched that, the smoked salmon was a bit stronger flavor than I'm used to and the best of it all was the giant plate of crab we shared at our table. This place was decent for $30 per person. I think what won us over was the great customer service, we had a chef who personally went to get us rice even though they did not have any and went to the other buffet to get us some, cuz us asians can't live without it and our waitress was VERY attentive, talk about fast refills on mimosas!",

(we were leaving that day)  all the buffets i called prior to calling paris only served them with dinner.  when i called paris to see whether they had crab legs for breakfast or lunch, i was told that they don't.  then i asked what time the crab legs came out (because i really wanted to eat at paris before leaving)  and lorenz said they came out at 11:30 or so.    ME:  \"Um, i thought you said they weren't served for breakfast or lunch.\" LORENZ:  \"They're not.  king crab legs are served during brunch\"  REALLY?  are we playing word games here?    basically, had i not asked what time the crab legs came out, i wouldn't have known, and we would have eaten elsewhere.  what an arse",

For others who don't, there are quite a few other things you can try that will tingle your taste buds. For example, the crepes are great. Have one with nutella and banana, or try the pasta or any of the breads they have. The Greek food station was average, and they skimped on the chicken in the fetuccini.   I thought they lacked a bit of variety. Service was great though and the champagne was actually nice (not the cheap stuff that tastes like cheap wine with fizz).  Overall, an average experience, and a bit over-hyped.",

The prices are usually moderate here, not overly cheap and not overly expensive. I'd estimate they're from $20-$35. Is that right?

Actually they do have a crepe station so that also sets it apart. I have only been to one other seafood buffet, kinda just getting into eating crab legs, I know I am so late, but I found that the crab legs here are extremely salty. I wonder if they cook them with the same water where they were found. The crab legs at The Cannery Row Buffet are not salty.   Another con is that the buffet looks huge from the outside, but when you get inside you realize most of that is just seating. There is usually a long line to get in, but I imagine that is how most of the casino buffets are so no surprises for anyone there.   In conclusion, I would rather got to The Cannery on Seafood night and pay about the same price.",

And, once again, because of my parents and their rewards card, we didn't have to stand in an hour-long line...  Now, I am a huge fan of the breakfast meats.  Any variety, and shape, and size.  Almost every station had at least one type of breakfast meat.  Better yet, one entire station was all breakfast meats.  I was overwhelmed!!  I took a huge breath, then made the smart choice to sample some foods before I committed and took a giant portion.  One of my faves was a beef and turkey sausage with sweet potato and maple syrup.  It's got it all in one casing!! So yummy.  I also greatly enjoyed the poached eggs Basquaise.  It was a poached egg with a really delicious, somewhat spicy tomato sauce.  My breakfast dessert was a crepe with Nutella and blueberries--YUMMO!!  And it's always nice when the coffee's good.  That way, when you bundle up to face the freezing cold of winter-time Vegas, you've got some good caffeine in your veins.  Cheers to the Paris Buffet!!",

And I literally stood there for 10 minutes, waiting for others to request the more well done portions so that I could get to the rare center.  Service is decent; I had no problems.  I didn't find the wait staff having a nonchalant attitude in fact, I thought they were attentive although no particularly engaging or overly warm, but they did a good job.    I will come back again just because it's a place that is relatively consistent and always has a good selection.  Please bring back the escrgot, crab claws, shrimp cocktail!",

    "text": "Don't go expecting French food.  It's all pretty much industrialized American food, sometimes with a brief nod toward something vaguely French.  The bouillabaisse was about the best thing on the Sunday brunch menu, and it was pretty gritty.  Steak with veal sauce, also good.  Creme brulee had been torched prettily, but was not crisp by the time I had mine.  Went back for breakfast...not sure why.  It was terrible.  Soggy tarts from the night before, lots of heavy American food.  The corned beef hash tasted like it had rotted a bit.  Also would hate for anyone to think the gummy little crepe wrapper was anything like the real thing.  Service both times was below par.  Had to ask twice for our drinks and flag down server for extra napkins.  Go to Mon Ami Gabi in the same casino and get a real meal and good service for about the same money.",

(Ghetto, huh? =P) They had crepes, eggs, sausages, eggs benedict, waffles, pancakes....very satisfying for those breakfast lovers. I have to admit it is decent for breakfast. The best thing they had there was the Nutella & Banana crepes (you have to special order it from the chef). You have to eat that!   Breakfast lines can be viciously long! Be sure to come early or you may have to wait about an hour to eat!  Do not eat their lunch if you don't have to. There are better buffets like Planet Hollywood's. Dinner was not that great either! I had the pleasure of eating here one time a few years ago! If anything, breakfast is the best bet!",

    "text": "Years ago I thought LV buffets were the cat's meow. But after my last visit, I think the only reason to go to one is just because it's much cheaper than going to a quality place.   The Paris buffet was decorated cutely. We went for lunch and it was a total bargain at $17 and change. Our server was efficient and we didn't have any sort of wait. That is the good part.   The bad part, well the food was boring and bland. The only thing I tasted that I actually thought \"oh, this is really good\" were grape leaves.   Whether or not I would recommend this place really depends on what you are aiming for. If you want to thrill your taste-buds with the amazing international cuisine options from award winning chefs that LV is know for - this is not your place. If you want to save a few bucks and want to be full on the low - then go here!",

The service at the buffet was definitely great, we had come for dinner on New Year's eve night only to find that the place was PACKED! They have a pretty good selection of meats, a few pastas, and of course they have a carving station.  I was slightly disappointed that when certain foods were out, some weren't refilled as quickly as I had hoped.  It was definitely a plus that the crab legs were slightly already cracked for you, but claws and such were a bit hard to eat (and the claw is my FAV!).  I do believe that it's pretty pricey for what it is, especially when there are other buffets that I think are just a tad better.  Their dessert station was also only \"okay\" for me - though they do get a thumbs up for having creme brulee!!  I hear brunch is fabulous... I definitely need to go back for that!",

Not a seeing-eye dog, just some medium-sized mutt with no collar, sniffing around the table of the party he was with. At least I assume it was the party he came in with. I asked an employee what was going on & they told me it was Tori Spelling's dog. Like that explained everything. I don't care if it was Queen Elizabeth, her dog shouldn't have been allowed in. Period.  That visit probably would've been my last visit to the Paris anyway. The food was flavorless except for the fruit tart I had for dessert. I did end up having two of those, they were excellent. But the rest of the meal wasn't worth the price paid or the time spent waiting to get in. There was one line to pay and then there was another line for seating.   Staff who say \"bonjour\" and \"merci\" don't make up for much. Yuck!",

But the carving station wasn't all that good - the prime rib was overcooked, and they didn't even have horseradish to go along with it.  There's always a long line to get in, but it moves fairly quickly; about a 20 minute wait at the most; i think. Maybe the weekends is more; not sure.  The reason I didn't give it more than 3 stars is that I've been to better buffets in Vegas; and also their dessert selection wasn't all that good. and you would think that being a french buffet it will be all about the pastry!  They do have a crepe station which is a big plus; but still I've been to much better places in other hotels.",

The main reason why I like this place SO much is that its different.  Whenever you go to a buffet, its the same usual stuff.  But not at Le Village Buffet.  They offer a different style of food with the authentic \"Paris\" feel that the hotel provides.  It should be place to eat at if you want to get away from your normal buffets.",

When I glanced at the food lines, most dishes were out!!! Out of food at a buffet??? I should have known that there was a poor management. When we returned to our table to eat.. all of us picked up grilled asparagus. I have NEVER seen a grilled asparagus that bad.. it was almost like chewing a bamboo stick.. impossible to chew asaragus??? something was not right!  I called the manager to let him know. He agreed that it looked bad, but did nothing about it. Again... poor management!  The rest of the food was okay... not even wanting to go back for second rounds at a buffet. That's how bad it was.  I will not waste my money going to a place like thus to eat ever again.  Bottom line.. bad food will loose costumers!!!!!",

The line is ridicuously long to get in and we were all starving by the time we were finally seated.  You would think I would've given this a 5 star since everything always tastes better when you're starving!  But everything I tried was just Ok, and there were only a couple of really tasty items.  My favorite was the prime rib.  My piece was perfectly pink and juicy.  They didn't have as much of a selection as I had hoped....a lot of their selections are your standard breakfast fare like eggs and bacon, waffles, toast, etc.  Lots of fillers, so I passed on all of them.  Things to note were the crepe and omelette stations which were both fantastic but those lines are always pretty long so I just tried a little of my friend's.  Dessert station was pretty good, but choices were nothing special.  We did spot some macarons which we loaded up onto our plate, but they use a type of raspberry jam as their macaron filling and it was just WAAAY too sweet.  We ended up opening up the macaron and scraping out the jam...for every single macaron.  And that was still their best dessert.  The creme brulee came in a close second, but they were always out!   I took off a star for their meager selections and long lines, and another one for the lack of preparedness...if you're running a buffet, the first rule of thumb is to ALWAYS stay up to date with your buffet items! Never let the items run out!",

    "text": "Coming back from Paris over the summer, I knew I had high expectations. Being that Vegas has brought(or stolen) pieces from around the world and placed them in one city, I figured the food would have a large French influence with a dash of American on top.  What was good? The ratatouille was not bad. The creme brulee had a nice caramelized shell ontop and a small sized serving. The prime rib and king crab were good like any other buffet would have it. But of all things I loved the shwarma. It was in the corner and all the stuff was separate, but I got the pita bread and filled it up with the hummus, lamb, roasted eggplant and some other stuff too.  It wasn't the freshest, since not many people were eating from there, but I loved it. The had chicken and beef too, but I really wished they had falafel.  Sad food? The french onion soup was just sitting there, and I had to move over to sprinkle the croutons on, and the thick slices of assorted cheese was on the other side. In addition, the soup wasn't hot enough to meal the cheese.  It wasn't very tasty... A lot of the meat was really dry or bland.  I tried the canard de l'orange, but it just tasted like regular roasted duck. They had sushi... I didn't care for that.. at a french buffet? com'on. There were some different fish pieces that were bland, but i didn't know what to accompany it with due to how all the food was organized.  I tried a macaroon, and it was not made traditionally.  They stacked it incorrectly, it tasted more like bread than caramelized sugar, and the had some type of almond shavings on top to make it crunchy. And last of all.... the crepe.. sooo sad.... I saw the people before me get theirs and I saw how goopy it was, so I asked if I could have mine extra crispy.  I had nutella, bananas, whipped cream, and I also wanted apricots. However, she gave me a look and asked if I was sure as if I was crazy.  She put it on the side for me, instead and when I sat down to take a bite, still soggy. So soggy that my crepe had burst open...sigh  To be honest, this was a buffet and the quality of food goes down when it is mass produced. On the other hand, it's a vegas buffet on the strip at $25 + tax and gratuity for our group of 20. The food was not bad for being a buffet, but wasn't great to be called french.",

They offer your usual stuff for breakfast but the ones that stuck out the most were the French toast and the crepes.  For the crepes, you have to wait in line since the chef makes the crepes in front of you so they can be nice and fresh when you eat.  And since this a buffet, you can go back there as many as you can.  Unfortunately, my stomach could not bear a fourth crepe. If Le Village is great for breakfast, I wonder how it is for brunch?  Based on the reviews here, I need another trip to Vegas to here for brunch",

I do not regret it whatsoever. The prime rib was really good nice and juicy and very well cooked. The crepes and grilled section (beef chicken and veggies) were really good as well.  The money maker for me was the steamed crab legs and chocolate covered strawberries they offered us since my buddy had that membership.   I think the ambiance was really cool too, made you feel like you were literally in a village in paris or something. i kinda wished we were in one of those little houses but the food definitely compensated.  Overall it was really quality over quantity that did it for me. i doubt i'll ever go without my friend though, for the price and selection, i'd still rather RIO.",

That's why the restrooms are so near by - know what I mean? Ok, that's gross, but these are the kinda things you gotta know. So anyway, they have all kinds of European dishes (did you know that ratatouille is not only a rat, but also an actual dish? It's good too), and they have a carving station, and they have a seafood area including crab legs, and they have a dessert station, and a crepe station. Incredible incredible little village this is. The wait staff is pretty good too.  Man, I can't wait to get back to Le Village. Must. Go. Soon.",

Our hostesses and our server were great. No complaints there. But the food? Meh. It seemed really light in offerings compared to other buffets and what was  offered wasn't anything special. And what was being served was picked over. There were empty spaces on the serving stations. We had to look around to find a plate. The serving utensils at the desert station were filthy. I sampled three or four deserts, not one of them worth eating...the macaroons were beyond basic. I had prime rib (there was no ham when I was there) the first small piece was good. Later I decided to try it again because I wasn't finding anything good to eat, and the second piece was almost kind of icky. I don't know what happened. I didn't eat it.  I hope all the blogs bragging up this buffet amend their recommendations of this place. Even with a reservation it was not worth it.",

To me, the real standouts here would be the eggs benedict and the brie mac and cheese.    For a buffet, I was shocked on how perfect the egg was on my benedict, and how crispy the muffin remained.  It was just amaing.  The sauce was decent, nothing earth shattering, but the benedict as a whole was well balanced and good.   The brie mac and cheese was amazing!  It was creamy, not too salty, and the sides were nice and charred.  The macaroni shells itself had a nice firmness, so it wasn't this mushy pile of mess.  I couldn't help but get seconds and thirds.  Overall, the buffet was decent.  The prime rib was actually good, and if you wanted a more crispier cut after your first serving of medium slice, they can grill your slice for you.  If you do the buffet of buffets deal for $49.99, make sure you save this place for your champagne brunch.  What a value!",

But that would have been ok if only the food quality was good.  Nobody really took care of our table for our duration of the stay, which is about 1.5 hrs.  I think they are understaffed maybe, but hey if you are charging full fare they you better be adequately staffed to serve.  And all I'm asking is clearing the plates from the tables, nothing more.  The food quality and selection is poor comparing to many others I've visited during this trip, and some were already being out for too long and cold, for example the grilled zucchini and grilled mushrooms.  The crepe was good, which is why the fair 2 stars, but the guy serving the crepes wasn't pleasant to deal with either.  They have the crepe menu all the way on the right side of the wall, and I was accused for \"being in the line so long and didn't even look at the menu\" by the server when it was my turn to order - why hide your menu all the way against the right wall then, and not somewhere in front facing the customer where it's supposed to be, then blame it on us like you're having a bad day.  So many choices here in Vegas, won't be coming back!",

I sampled the bagel and lox, oatmeal, pancakes, and fruit. All was mediocre. My main concern was the smell on some of the cantaloupe. It had a foul odor so it may have been old.   The service was extremely lackluster. We had to flag down the waitress twice just to get more coffee.   Overall, you get what you pay for. We could have gone to a bigger name breakfast buffet and paid $35, but we went here. In my opinion, it's not worth $20 and I won't be back.",

Thankfully this buffet was full of delicious food that made me want to enjoy it and not just chow down to get my money's worth!   The crepe station was probably my favorite. They have a list of savory and sweet options and they're all made fresh, however you want them. Bring a few bucks to tip these guys as they are quick and make really delicious crepes. The other areas are set up according to regions in France but if you're like most people it's just different food stations;) They had a good selection of different seafood such as clams, mussels, and shrimp. No crab legs for lunch though, bummer!   They also have a nice salad area and make sure you save room for the dessert station! The macaroons were awesome and I believe there a few different flavors to try. Everything was great, the price was average for a buffet, and I didn't feel like a whale after eating at least 3-4 plates of delicious food! The buffet was not overwhelming as some can be. There were a lot of choices but not so many that I felt I had to try it all which is probably why other buffets have caused me to feel lethargic after eating at them.   The service was a little off which is why I can't give them 5 stars. We were there with friends who were Diamond members who had already paid for everyone. When we arrived there was a host that was over-catering to another group and completely ignored us. When we tried to tell another host that we had already paid and just needed to find our group we had to repeat it several times and the host for some reason still could not understand and kept telling us to get in line and pay. It ended up that we finally ended up calling our friends to come out and meet us. After that debacle things got better and the waitstaff inside was very attentive.",

I ordered unlimited mimosas for $12. In my hometown of Sacramento it's basically the same price at many places so I thought this was pretty worth it, especially for Vegas! You could also do plain champagne, wine, or beer. The champagne and OJ ratio was just right for me and I downed about 6 of those!  The food was fantastic! There is usually stuff at a buffet that I don't care for after taking a bite but I don't remember not enjoying anything I put on my plate. Everything I grabbed was full of flavor and so delicious. Definitely visit the crepe station and be sure to grab Creme Brulee from the dessert bar!  Our waitress was great. She was pretty swamped but always made sure if she was walking by and I asked for another mimosa that my request was acknowledged. She even apologized for being swamped multiple times even though we didn't feel neglected at all.  This buffet is one you must visit, especially if you have the 24 hour pass!",

None of the food here is actually spectacular but none of it is bad either and the variety sure doesn't disappoint. And when I'm talking variety I mean all the trappings you'd expect out of a good Vegas buffet experience: solid breakfast bar, meat station, salad bar, kabob bar, and so forth. I think the standouts for me included the creme brulee, the omelette station, smoked salmon, and some of the fish entrees.  I guess my only real gripe with the place is the arrangement of the place...everything seems physically congested and when they wheel out the trash bins for clean up you might feel like it can get kind of close to the food. Still, the ambiance is nice...Disney-esque in a way since the buffet tries to mimic the feeling of eating in a French village.   Service was good here and your standard drinks like sodas and juices (and refills) come with the regular price - I can't say with certainty whether you get champagne refills though. Le Village Buffet is definitely a decent buffet that doesn't rank among the very best buffets I've had, but its certainly one of the more well valued buffets I've been to.",

    "text": "What can I say, I had high expectations as far as pastries. Got here and it was very limited. On the plus side they had crepes made to order. I'm not a big crepe fan but it was good. The omelette was delicious and if you haven't you must try the chicken sausage hidden in the end with the little bagels. The eggs benedict weren't very good. The selection/ buffet seemed smaller/ limited compared to their other Caesar's counter parts. Staff was friendly though. Only thing I had issue with was I purchased the all you can drink champagne and I only got two because our server was so slow in refilling it. Maybe it was because she was older...? Had they been more attentive with drink refills I would have given 5 stars. I'm glad we have the buffet of buffets pass. Definitely not one I would come and pay for full price for Sunday brunch. Going to walk to Flamingo then Harrah's to get pastries/ dessert now. If you have a choice on brunch I would recommend spice buffet at planet Hollywood where the mimosas are included. Much bigger selection and the food is delicious. The only thing is no crab legs for brunch there.",

I was expecting somewhat the French theme but except for the crepes and a fish soup the rest was just the usual buffet food (roast, ham, sausages, pasta, some side dishes). The salad / fruit counter  was mediocre (only melon and water mellow as fruit) and included a not particularly good sushi (French?). The crepes were disappointing - not even the option to put fresh fruit in it. The sweets were not that good either, some cakes and and of course a very French soft ice cream machine.  The price for lunch was 25 plus taxes. Kids 4 and older pay 14$. Considering that we are not big eaters and there were not many dishes worth trying it was really a waste of money.  My next time to Vegas I will return to the Wicked spoon in the cosmopolitan casino.. Amazing food",

Our waiter was Jason and he was fab.  I went as part of the Buffet thing and this was our last meal.  I wish that we had made it our first.  The waiter was very attentive in getting our drinks.  I asked for two drinks a lemonade and Mountain Dew - done.  Now onto the food.  I was stuffed by the time that I walked out of there.  There was so much food - but soo little space in my belly.  The tri trips, suasiages, chicken, etc.  The prime rib was great.  I evern saw them put on whole legs on the fire and start to cook.  Now the seafood - crab sticks, mussels, etc was great.  I had the Salmon and it was done great.  I wanted to eat more but I was stuffed.  The crepes with the whipped cream.  The cook had to use a spoon to get it out of the bowl.  The crepes were done to perfection and crepe was not precooked like at Planet Hollywood.  It was like I had gone to heaven.  I ended up with two crepes and that was enough.  Now the Creme Burle,,,it was great.     People may complain that the buffet has gone down over the years.  For me it was great.  It was well worth going.    They have food from different parts of france and the scenery made it even better.  Sometimes it is the small things that matter - a waiter to bring you your drinks, good food, and then the deserts...no more needs to be said.  Just go.  Again, jason was wonderful and I hope that he gets a raise soon.",

Sunday Brunch with champagne included: $30.99 per person WITHOUT Total Rewards Players Card. I think it's $29.99 for TR members.  Food selection wasn't really good. VERY small section of Italian, no Asian dishes except for fake, gross sushi. No Mexican section either. There were plenty of breakfast dishes though....yes, I know I went here for \"brunch\" but damn....it was almost 1pm when we got seated. I would at least expect there to be more lunch options versus breakfast... They got some good soups (potato leek and creamy chicken), nice \"french\" breads and bagels, some fancy cheese options.  Dessert was kind of a let down. No gelato. They only had a cheap ice cream machine with the usual chocolate and vanilla flavors. They do however have macaroons (yes...they advertise that like crazy), parents enjoyed the caramel brulee and the lemon cream pie.   I came. I tried. I'm NOT coming back.",

So yes, my friend and I have avoided the long line and we went through the \"VIP\" door where we checked in, paid, and got seated right away.   Our server came up to our table right away to take our drink order and we've proceeded to getting our food. The moment I saw Prime Rib... I've patiently waited for the people in front of me to get their cut and make up their minds about which sauce to put. Next, I went to their seafood area and there was a horde of people taking all the crab legs which I find very annoying... because hello people you're not the only ones at the buffet to take all of those crab legs. I left but I had an intention to go back for my second round of plate.   I saw the dessert selections and I love their french macaroons the most... the same person taking all the crab legs was behind me so I took all the chocolate french macaroons.. I mean seriously there was only 5 left lol payback I guess?  In the end... I got my crab legs and left a happy camper. Our server was very quick and attentive filling up our waters and other drinks.

The inside reminded me of Beauty and the Beast (Disney), as it really does look like a somewhat cartoony French village.  They did a really good job on this one.  The food is of decent quality.  Plenty of seafood (snow crab but no Alaska king crab).  I really liked the pasta, especially the macaroni and cheese (go figure).  The cheese section is a good way to try the various types out there if you've never had too much exposure in the past.  One head-scratcher is that there's a sushi section.  Don't get me wrong, it's of decent quality even by Vancouver standards.  I just wonder if Napoleon packed that in his lunch when heading off to battle.  The desserts are top notch.  Hello chocolate, sugar, and diabetes.  Service is good overall.  The washrooms here are pretty small and cramped, so you may want to use the facilities in the main casino area instead.  While this is no Baccanal buffet (which is also costs $25 more), Le Village does hold its own, and is a great place to gorge oneself.",

    "text": "Merci Boucoup Village Buffet for the Veterans Day free meal for active duty members!   This French cuisine themed buffet is located inside the Paris casino. On this visit our wait in line was only a short 10 minutes!!! Wow we got lucky! So come early.  I've been here several times over the years and have enjoyed it. It's quaint and not over the top big with miles of walking while you have a plate in your hand. So don't compare it to Cesar's, Wynn or Cosmopolitan buffets or you'll be greatly disappointed. There's enough food just not an amazing array of stand out choices. It's French inspired unlike other buffets on the strip which offer massive international cuisine options. So just keep that in mind.  Dinner was $69 for two. But call for current pricing. At the time I wrote this review Paris players card holders get $3 off the buffet.  The food here is good, although a few dishes were meh. Not all the food was French. I saw some Mediterranean flavors (Gyro etc) and sushi rolls. I saw a grill where they were cooking chicken and other meats. So Paleo dieters rejoice.  Hopefully you will sit in the open dining room area with the open French Market atmosphere, if you get stuck in the back room like we did it loses the allure as these rooms are small and they block all the fun views. You'd think it would be quiet but we were stuck in there with screaming babies.  Here are some of the traditional French dishes that I saw and some I tried:  Duck a la Orange (yummy),  Roast beef Crab Legs (they were always out) Shrimp (on the shell) Chicken Coq au Vin (good),  Seafood Bouillabaisse,  Scalloped potatoes (which were not great),  Whipped potatoes (not as good as the Wynn),  Pasta in truffle butter (fabulous),  Macaroni and Cheese (nope not great),  Green Beans Almondine,  Asparagus (wonderful),  Salmon (heavenly),  Poached Halibut,  Sweet and Savory made-to-order crepes (filling and great),  French cheeses and bread,  French onion soup (salty), potato leek soup (wonderful), tomato soup (skip it) and a Small dessert station with mostly all empty trays:(    Sadly on this visit it was like a football team came before I did.  They were out of crab legs every time I went up to check!  By the time the crab showed up I was already on dessert! So go get crab legs first! And they're served cold.  Overall, we had great attentive service and since my sister's are fans (and they always pay for dinner) ...I'll probably be back. This is one of the original \"big\" buffets and breakfast is served here too! I'll be back.",

The best part of this buffet is the steam crabs.  Our waitress kept coming serving us big bowls of steam crab legs to share.  That was amazing. She also serviced us well with our mimosas.  She definitely made sure to keep it coming.  As for the selections of food, it was A-OK!",

I can say I'm glad we did, but we probably won't be back.  The one thing that I did like was that there were many veggie options.  I mostly stuck to those.  Everything seemed too salty - even the mashed potatoes.  Our waiter took our drink order, and then after about 10 minutes came back and said he had forgotten what we ordered.  For a refill of iced tea, he brought it with no ice!  What?  He seemed inexperienced.  There's another nearby buffet that has discounts online that has food that is just as good, if not better.",

Poor! Then the food selection was so so the place looks big and packed from the outside but not really the food was your average buffet foods, their salad bar, was well what salad bar, they had very very little selection and not very much to choose from. The other foods was eh alright I guess I would defiantly not be coming back to this one for sure, I was told how good it was but it was not that great all. I think they spent more time on making it \"look like France\" than anything and had very little seating and to maneuver around the obstacles was enough and to make sure one didn't run into anyone. I think they really need to rethink this buffet style here. They just don't have a big selection of food to choose from, I think buffets should have a lot of choices.",

However, when we payed and were assigned a table, the food that was there, to our dismay, was really bad. There was no turkey or mashed potatoes. The salads did not look fresh, and the crab claws were too salty. When we asked the cook, who was cutting what was left of a  ribeye, when will food be served again, he replied \" maybe in an hour\" in a very nonchalant and disregarding mode. I could have let it go if it wasn't the fact that we payed $40.00 and obviously I was dealing with the disrespect of not just and employee, but the whole restaurant looking at the awful food that was served who knows who long ago, as well as the lack of interest by those working there. One could see empty pots with no food that obviously were there for a while and it didn't seem like any staff member was bothered to place fresh food or even get rid of the dirty pots there. Then trying to get a manager to complain and get our money back was another ordeal on its own and it was apparent Cindy had already dealt with a few complains and staffing issues... all very disorganized. If there is no food available, why continue charging those waiting for almost half an hour for a meal that is not worth that much whatsoever. It was not a good experience and obviously won't be going back there. Le Village management should be really appalled about the reviews here and do something about it.",

I've must have gone on a wrong Saturday because practically everything on the menu was either raw, dry, bland, and the meats were all full of fat, no trimming what so ever! I tasted the penne pasta and it was literally raw and same with the baked ziti. The prime rib was FULL of fat. I couldn't eat it. I couldn't even look at it. It was disgustingly disturbing how a restaurant can serve something like that. Next what was labeled as Turkey, ended up being pork (several items were mislabeled). I don't eat pork but luckily the 1st bite was so dry that I couldn't eat that as well. My boyfriend tried the crepes and it was not cooked all the way and the frozen fruits were still frozen! The cook looked mad so we didn't say anything. The only thing that we were able to eat was self made salad, pickled ginger, a banana muffin, and a banana for $70 bucks. What a waste of money. We did the suffering already so I hope you don't fall for their propaganda as well! Paris Hotel, your buffet restaurant needs major improvements and more variety. We couldn't believe the tiny selection we had to choose from, which was nothing!",

The selection of entrees and meats were very poor. There were only two things on the buffet that were edible. The peel and eat shrimp and the shells and white cheddar (Mac and cheese) just like the Pasta Roni brand at the grocery store from a box. The desserts weren't horrible, but definitely not the best. I will absolutely never return here even if it was offered for free. I had a horrible stomach ache for two days. I asked for a manager and I was told that they could cook another steak medium rare for us. I was so turned off by the whole buffet that I just wanted to leave. It was horrible to say the least, and I have never said that about a buffet before. The waitress was not rude, but not friendly either. I'm glad I had a Groupon because paying nearly $30 each for this buffet regular price would have definitely angered me. So sorry, but this buffet isn't worth $7.99 each let alone $30.

It's probably the smallest buffet I have ever seen. The watermelon looked like a squished tomato in the inside, the crab legs smelled of ammonia, the cocktail shrimp was fishy, the cocktail sauce was basically doctored ketchup. I ordered a ham and cheese crepe and it was literally cold inside and none of the cheese was melted. The creme brulee had a crust on it and not the kind you want. The macaroons weren't made correctly. All of the serving spoons were sticky and soiled and there were no plates at any of the stations except for two. The counters were filthy and my husband stepped in an ice cream cone that according to people sitting at the table near him had been there for a bit. The last complaint is the bathroom which was disgusting and I will allow the attached pictures speak for themselves.

Why does a french buffet have stale croissant's? Why? ): another -1 because our server was rude and got upset at us for getting seconds and said we should have told her that we were coming back since she thought we left. Why would we leave?

    "text": "If you like prime rib, snow crab legs, shellfish, or creme brulee, then come here. It tends to be much busier on weekdays because it's cheaper compared to the weekends. Be wary of long lines, especially for dinner!  I went on a weekday at about 11:00am. It was about an hour wait. Once we were seated, however, a waiter quickly came to take our orders for drinks. He was very courteous and took away plates and refilled drinks quickly.  The buffet has a salad bar, crepe station, a dessert section in the center, and European style food. There was pasta, saffron rice, potatoes, sauerkraut and sausage... all good.  The place is a bit cramped and dark if you're in the middle of the buffet. The long meat line can make it harder to see some of the food. But it is all worth it and more. Here are some notable foods:  The snow crab legs are what you'd find at many other buffets in Las Vegas. Fresh and good!  As for the shellfish, the mussels and clams were done in two ways when I was there: tomato-based sauce and white sauce. Both are equally delicious.  The prime rib is rare and melts in your mouth. I haven't had any better meat in my life. A long line can form along the buffet for this, so plan ahead!  There was a moderate selection of deserts such as small cakes, tarts, and the creme brulee. It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth.  The only complaint I have is the duck. It was dry, tough, and nearly inedible. However, there's a wide selection of other meats to choose from so it didn't affect the dining experience.  Now, as you're probably aware this place is not cheap! So here is a \"plan of attack\" for the buffet to get your money's worth:  1. You probably waited for a while and you're starving. However, you don't want to stuff yourself with the first plate. Make the first plate all seafood (crab legs, mussels, clams). Avoid carbs.  2. Get in line for some meat. This will let your stomach rest for the plate of meat.  3. Now, if there was that one pasta you've been wanting to try... eat those carbs but limit them if you want to eat dessert.  4. DESSERT!  If you love meat and seafood, you have to go here!",

    "text": "Easily the best buffet in Vegas. Our family of 4 killed three hours here for the standard price of $75.73. If you want some privacy while you gorge yourself on the decadent dishes available to you might I suggest asking for a seat inside one of their buildings instead of suffering in the open seating of general pop. You may have to wait a few extra minutes but the wait is well worth the comfort.   We prefer to catch breakfast and if you do too we have two suggested options. Lines are a real bitch and this place has the mega daddy of lines. If you want to avoid the hassle of weaving in and out of ropes slowly like castle be sure to set your alarm and get there no later than 8:30. This will ensure you beat the rush and will have no trouble being seated in your preferred location. Option two and perhaps our preferred option, if lines are no concern and you can wait the 30 minutes we say go around 10am the buffet starts their lunch switch around 10:30 being completed by 11 while still having the creeps and selected breakfast items available. Because we prefer savory over sweet this time suites our whole family as we have sweet addicted american children who are really just there for for the pancakes and pastries. This buffet also features gluten free items for anyone with dietary restrictions something difficult to manage while eating out.   Don't disappoint yourself with other vegas buffets this one really is the best quality while featuring the sweetest  staff imaginable. The two hosts are kind with welcoming faces and the waitstaff in-spite of the crowded dinning hall always manage to attend to any needs with what seems a genuine smile. All of this comes with their almost decades worth of A health code approval ratings.   Our favorites the eggs Benedict, I like to add some fresh locks and capers on top to fancy it up and all of the deserts kill it, it is Paris after all.",

My friends and I came here the most recent time in March 2017, and we had a Travelzoo deal that basically gave us the all-you-can-drink package for free.  There was a bit of a line when we went around 10 AM, but it wasn't a huge wait at all.  Great place if you're loading up on carbs for sure - the crepe station can have a decent crowd, but they're worth the wait (especially for a sweet crepe).  The rest of the food is decent quality for a buffet, and they taste pretty good.  My complaint is with the all-you-can-drink because our waitress gave us decreasing amounts of champagne with our mimosas, and after a few rounds, she simply stopped coming by our table.  So much for AYCD.  Overall 3.5 stars, rounded up because I feel like I'm in Belle's town singing \"Bonjour!\" every time I'm there.",

    "text": "Eating quality food in Vegas can get really pricey, so we researched some places on-line to eat Breakfast at. We eventually found Le Village at Paris and decided spending $16 for a Breakfast Buffet sounded like a great deal compared to other places where you could spend $16 a plate. Unfortunately, we arrived late and decided we didn't want to pay the $25 for their Champagne Brunch buffet, so we left and decided we would come back the next day. So, the next day we woke up early and headed over to Paris. We got in easily, the staff was courteous and didn't hoover and there was a great quantity of food as well as great quality. All in All I have to say this is the best breakfast buffet place I have ever eaten at.",

($11.99 per person) The Buffet costs $36 to start you think they would include this. As it turned out they re-nigged on the mixed drinks. The prime rib was cold and dry and tasted like it was a reheat from the day before. I tried 3 different shell fish dishes and all were cold, they were supposed to be hot so was a little worried about temp control. The crepes were not good at all kind of doughy. The wine was not all that good I think cheap chuck is better. Best part was the Bread, but for the regular price of about $100 for 2 people it is high for bread.",

I have noticed other reviewers claiming that it has gone downhill since its glory days.  My opinion is, this is not the case.  The selection is incredible and there are many stations.  I have not been to too many buffets in Vegas, but this HAS to be one of the largest.  No lobster, but plenty of shrimp and crab legs on the dinner menu.    Only drawback;  the long line to get in.  I went once for break fest and once for lunch and both times I waited approximately 40-45 minutes.  When we got inside, there were always empty tables.  Why can't the seating hostess seat more people right away?  Maybe they are trying to control the flow of people who are eating?  Regardless, will probably return.",

While I've had a lot of better buffets in Vegas, Paris' is still pretty darn good. If you are into crab legs, this is your buffet. Friends that love their crab tell me that this place is great for that.  Hubby and I went for Champagne Brunch and our waitress was way cool. She kept pouring the bubbly until we said to stop! ;) The crepes, as always, are great. I didn't get to the meat carving station but hubby said that his pork tenderloin was fantastic!  I only wish I would have saved room for dessert as they have an extensive dessert section. Next time. Because, for the price, I know I'll be hitting Paris' buffet again.",

    "text": "I can see why Le Village Buffet was popular several years back.  They received many awards for their food however I've come to the realization that the food is not quite up to par than what it was at their peak.   The food at Le Village Buffet consists of 5 provinces from France.  Each station is themed per province.  The line was somewhat long for dinner as we arrived around 7pm.  We were all starving considering our last real meal was prior to our departure in San Jose.   Once we were seated it was no holds bar.  We each took off and got our food.  I remember getting the prime rib which I liked the best.  Meat was tender and cooked perfect.  Everything else was just okay for me.  I was hungry so it really didn't matter.  The sole was good though.  Very fresh and tasty.  Other notable notes was the cheese station and desserts.  The creme brulee and lemon tart were really good.  I can't eat shellfish but everyone kept getting the crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Service was good.  The ambiance reminded me of an outdoor village-like setting.  For dinner we were seated inside an actual cottage of some sort.  It felt more quiet and intimate whereas for lunch (yes we came here again the next day) we were seated in the outdoor setting which I preferred.  Honestly I've had better buffet experiences in Vegas. I don't know if I would come back here again unless they revamped their menu.",

I had been starving all day and, therefore, had good prospects of visiting it for dinner.  WELL.... For $25 for dinner, sure - it wasn't a bad deal.  But the food variety/quality weren't exactly up to par.  Perhaps I had too high of expectations.  But I really wasn't WOW'd.  Perhaps I'm just in a reallly negative mood (after having written a one-star review of Delta airlines) and such negativity is spilling onto this review.  Nonetheless, I certainly wasn't wow'd by Le Village buffet.  In addition to the disappointing food, our serving lady kept forgetting to get us our beverages and utensils.  But she sure did come by enough times to ask, \"You OK??\"  Kinda strange.  Kinda.  Fresh crepes:  Sure, they're fresh all right.  But since when are crepes as thick and puffy as hamburger buns??  The texture was off as well.  The only thing I liked about their crepes was the unlimited availability of fresh blueberries.  Oh yeah, how could I forget -- no chocolate ingredients at a creperie??  Now THAT's outrageous!  What I did like was the availability of fresh king crabs and mussels.  Also enjoyable was the decor (but no music??!?!??).   Meh.",

Luckily, we were in Vegas, where, at some price, anything can happen. For us, the $10 \"Cut the Line\" Express Pass was worth bringing us two hours closer to a never-ending spread of cute \"French\" delights. Le Village was my favorite of the buffets we sampled while we were in Vegas. There was enough of a themed selection to play up the novelty of eating in a French village at dusk. Food was okay. The crepes were fantastic, if only because there aren't many places besides creperies and IHOP where you can sample 8 different types of sweet and savory--my favorite was the Monkey, which is a banana, chocolate and almond filling. Le Village also offers other regional French specialties, including haricots verts and bouilliabase. These were clearly a \"made for the masses\" offering. Overall, a fun experience with okay food.",

In Vegas, we always make time for the buffet because we're gluttons and love a little bit of everything. Why order one breakfast item when you can have 20?  The hotel gave us a coupon book for different activities and restauants. There was a coupon f or $5.00 off per person for the buffet so we decided we had to go for breakfast, despite the line. While in line, I pulled up their Yelp review. Reviews were mixed, most good, some bad. We just went for it and boy was it worth it.  With your total rewards card you receive $3.00 then we had the coupon for $5.00 more off which came to a total of $23.00 for two. Not too bad at a Vegas buffet. We were seated pretty quickly after paying then it was on.  There were variations of eggs, french toast, bacon, pancakes and even crepes (which we totally worth the wait, by the way). There weren't as many desserts as I hoped but the ones they had were definitely quality.  I will certainly be back again. Worth every penny!",

Seafood as far as the eye can see...roast beef, roast lamb, roasted pork - basically if it was meat it could be roasted...and my ultimate favorite...ALL YOU CAN DRINK CHAMPAGNE.  Yes, it's a little pricy (it's $25) and the lines can get pretty ridiculously long, but if you're a Yelper worth his or her salt, you can easily drink/eat/drink that $25 back without breaking into sweat.  Plus, you'll be drunk/full/drunk for the rest of the day!  WIN!",

Of all the buffet prime rib in Vegas, theirs may be the best. I had an end and my brother had another piece somewhere in the middle, and we both agreed it was juicy and well seasoned. The tri tip is also really good, as is the eggs benedict. We sat outside and got to people watch during our meal, which further enhanced this experience. The waitress also kept their champagne glasses full and was very attentive to us. We had a wonderful dining experience here, which my brother won't stop talking about, and I highly recommend this place. I've done brunch at the Bellagio and the Wicked Spoon, and Paris is every bit as good as theirs is.",

Le Village Buffet will poison you with two main delicacies: their dishes and their prices. Relative to other buffets, Le Village is not only more economic but more worthy of your time and palate. Their many stations offer food from various regions of France. You will also get your typical buffet items like salad and dessert bars. Weekend brunch with champagne and mimosas is not to be missed. Their crepe station and coffee are my personal favorites. Make a free reservation through Open Table and skip the ridiculous line. Choose this place over Wicked Spoon and The Buffet at Wynn any time.",

Interior decor seriously reminds one of a little outdoor cafe, especially with the painted ceiling. It feels very cozy and a very fun place to eat. Went in for lunch when there was no line and paid about $20. Had to wait a few minutes for a table and it only served to increase my hunger which was helpful =).  Food was mostly your standard buffet fare with some French-style dishes which I did not attempt to try. As with all buffets I usually hit up the carved meats which I feel give you the most bang-for-your-buck. It was here that I got THE most tender prime rib that excelled that of the $43 Wynn buffet. They did get a minus in my book though for not shelling their shrimp which was a bit annoying but it just served for me to get more meat and pasta.  Overall a decent buffet in a nice environment if you're not looking to break the bank. I am definitely coming back here to eat whenever I hit up Sin City.",

Only giving 1 star because: A) yelp doesnt allow negatives B) our server Mimi was delightful.  Back to the grub... The carving station's roast beef was beyond awful...need a chainsaw to cut and jaws of steel to chew. WOW Went around 11.30am, there were half-assed breakfast items that were gross, most not replaced, lunch items only highlight is the big square cheese crackers like the italian ones, and the iced crab legs were ok. Potato leek soup decent, and the rest of the buffet there were so many disgusting items, I lost count. Very bad selection, not even a good salad bar, lifeless limp and limited it was. I wanted to take pics but didnt wanna gross out anyone. Its really, really bad. Anyone giving this buffet over 2* really needs to check into a taste bud clinic or something. No pizzas, no decent salads, oversauced lukewarm garbage, very limited items. Hope you like bread, crab legs (for lunch/dinner) and omelettes/croissants in the morning, rest is absolute shit with piss on top.",

    "text": "Paris, Las Vegas. I've been to many vegas buffets, ranging from MGM, Bally's, and Rio, to Luxor Bellagio, Mirage, and many other ones in between.  I went to the IHeartRadio Music Festival in Vegas on Friday with my friend. We were staying at the LVH, but I decided to take her to the Le Village in Paris Hotel and Casino for the lunch buffet. We went around 1:30 on a Friday afternoon, and there was no wait, which was nice. The setting was nice and dark for a romantic mood. The service there was really good. Had my drinks ready when they were out and plates cleared out when new ones came in.    Now onto the food itself. They had Prime Rib for lunch, which is kind of rare since most of the lunch buffets I've been to don't really have prime rib, they have roast beef. I tried their prime rib, which is probably my go to dish when I go to buffet's in vegas. It was pretty good. The rareness is perfect, I like my prime rib as rare as possible, but of course it has to be hot haha.. Not cold uncooked prime rib. There were lots of food choices, On my first plate I tried some clam, quiche (taste meh), mashed potatoes, pasta, and some cocktailed shrimp (however the shell isn't peeled which sucks..ended up just eating the shell and feet, at least they clean the poop out). Prime rib was the only thing that stood out. Everything else was kind of filler. I went back again for a second prime rib and this time they gave me a thick a$$ slice, it was probably equivalent to 3-4 prime rib slices they normally give. After eating that, I was just stuffed. Couldn't eat anything else but dessert.   Dessert:  My friend ordered a banana, nutella, hazelnut crepe. It was presented very nice, but tasted ok. The nutella didn't really taste like nutella, and the nutella was like a syrup was like put on top not inside of the crepe. Only the banana was inside. They also put a huge load of whipped cream...which was too much.   Next, my friend and I went on a dessert sampler..We got like one of each dessert available. We started off with creme brulee, brownies, some sort of raspberry cake, some cookies, flan and more. We basically only took a bite of each except for creme brulee... The creme brulee was really good, We went on and grabbed 2 more haha. That's the only dessert worth getting in my opinion.   Overall,  I give it 3 stars, there are other choices that I feel taste better such as Bellagio, MGM and the buffet in the Mirage.   It cost 21.99 a person, and personally did not feel like it was worth it. Go try something else. Maybe it taste better at night. For now I'll tick with Bellagio.",

The food is different than other buffets on the strip and that's always refreshing.   I love the crepes they make you fresh! Only problem was that when you order a savory crepe, they weren't cooking it long enough so the cheese and/or ham, whatever it's stuffed with, will be left unmelted or cold inside. I made a small complaint to our wonderful server Mimi and she let the chef and her manager know. I went back for a second serving and I also asked the chef to please cook it longer and it was so delicious!!   My boyfriend and I were served warm crab legs (bonus for being a platinum rewards member) and the legs were good as well.   Bottomless mimosas are a nice touch, we didn't drink as much as we normally would but the refills on the champagne were a little slow. I just didn't care because I didn't feel like getting drunk.   Didn't get to try all the food because I was in love with the crepes and waffles (so fresh!) and their different potatoes and Mac and cheese is good. Their eggs Benedict, I'm sorry to say, is pretty bad. Dry, over-cooked egg with a hard muffin and tasteless hollandaise sauce, that was a little disappointing.  Their macarons are ok; they're made right texture-wise but the filling is just super sweet chocolate and not very good. That's a shame because macarons are amazing and it should be a highlight at a French buffet.   All in all, great experience again at this buffet. Mimi is a wonderful server she was funny and kind and took her time to make sure everything was to our liking. Even the ladies at the front who take your payment were very friendly. I can't wait to come back and eat here again(especially the crepes!)",

Basically he said you can visit ALL of the Caesar resorts buffets as much as you want for 24 hrs. We though this was an amazing deal, we could have lunch at the Paris, dinner at Caesar's, and breakfast somewhere else all for $50 dollars!  We purchased our wrist bands at Paris and the woman said \"Yes, this is good at ALL Caesar's resorts.\" We went to have dinner at Caesar's later that day and after checking in with the hostess she said \"oh, you know you have to pay an ADDITONAL $30 per person, right?\" WHAT?! What a total rip off. We should have known the \"good deal\" was too good to be True. They stamp a little thing on the back of your receipt stating \"pay as little as $15 for upgrade to Caesars buffet.\" Who bothers to read the fine print on the back of a receipt? If we would have known it would have been extra, we would have never bothered. We also wouldn't have had to walk my 74 year old father clear across the strip for all the trouble. Paris didn't offer to do anything to rectify the confusion, and I really feel bad for other people falling for this \"deal.\"   All that being said, The Paris buffet had some good things to it in regards to food:  The brioche French toast, the salmon, roasted sweet potatoes, the pasta dishes were all favorites.   Some not so good: Lack of fresh fruit and veggies - the salad offerings were very poor.  The crepe station...the \"bananas\" on the nutella crepes were mushy and weird, swimming in some sweet mystery liquid and then drenched in whipped topping and lord knows what else.   Go across the way to \"La Creperie\" and pay $10 for a decent crepe.  There are too many other places in Vegas to eat, I wouldn't come again,",

    "text": "We went there for breakfast this mor ing and I am very dissapointed with the service and selection.   Well for starters, they sat us next to the herring and whitefish so the entire time we were smelling fish.  The waitress never came to take our drink order, just plopped a jug of coffee on the table and walked away. When we asked her for a drink she gave us a death stare. Came back with orange juice instead of a diet coke like we ordered.   Some other issues: - too pricey the selection was minimal for breakfast - the lady at the crepe station was fighting with a customer of crepes - they left metal serving spoons on top of the burners and they were 1000 degrees when you went to grab food - the staff all looked miserable  - I had a stack of 3 plates going before she finally took the plates off the table. - they indicate on the table reciept if you tipped before you were sat. At this point you didn't provide a service, why the hell would I tip.  Highly don't recommend. Avoid at all costs.",

It was a dinner on Saturday so I expected to pay $30.99 as stated on their website, but nope it cost me more. So that was not cool. Additionally, there wasn't a lot of food options. What I liked most was the macaroons (only had 2 flavors) and flan. What also got to me was the unfriendliness by the staff and my waitress poor service because I'm so thirsty and she's not around to refill my drink. Also, tip was expected upfront before you try the food and service so I thought that was backwards. Defeats the point of tipping.",

Crab legs were cut open in half so no fighting with them and they weren't dried out, seafood was tasty, great variety of sausages, and sides. They had a cheese station and like 7 -8 different rolls. Desserts were out of this world! Sushi was great, crepes were made to order yummm! My only complaint couldn't get a martini :(  With all the choices we had we went back a 2nd time.",

Their menu includes unique seafood dishes, an entire array of fresh-cut meats and French staples like French Onion Soup.  The price is also very reasonable for a Vegas buffet; with all the options you have at this place, you'd imagine to be paying at least $10 more. I think we only payed about $25 each for dinner on a Sunday night.  The ambiance is also warm and quaint, reminiscent of old-school themed Vegas hotels and possibly even Europe. I'll definitely be back to Le Village.",

    "text": "Arrived around 11 AM on a Friday, and luckily the line wasn't too long. The wait was around 15-20 minutes before we were seated at a table and asked what we wanted to drink.   There's the typical food that most buffets have - salad, cheeses, Mexican, dessert, prime ribs, lots and lots of bread, etc. But what caught my eye, and my friends' eyes, was the crepes station! There were eight different crepes to choose from, with the maximum of two at a time. Four were savory and four were sweet. I opted for the sweeter crepes, and ordered the berries one and the apples one. The line took about half an hour before I finally got my crepe. After the long line, I'd have to say that the crepes were okay, but not great. The skin was a little too thick for my liking. For my berries crepe, I thought the berries were too sour. I liked the apple one a lot, but there was too much caramel sauce drizzled on top for me to enjoy. I was also able to try La Caprese (the pesto one), the chicken one, the ham one, and the banana and nutella one. Basically everything offered that morning. The best would have to be the ham one. The mozzarella cheese and pesto - the mozzarella balls didn't melt so it was pretty blehh. There's a jar to tip the chef for their hard work, as there is only one pasty chef making the crepes at a time.   As for the other food, I heard the prime rib was not too good here compared to Rio. The mushrooms were pretty tasty, but a little too much sauce. I didn't see any crab legs that the other reviewers commented upon, but I suppose there was a good variety.   The best best part of the buffet was the creme brulee. Oh my goodness, it was so melt in your mouth sweet and delicious, and the top perfectly burnt. Must try! There wasn't any more fruit tarts when we went, but we asked one of the pastry chefs who had some hidden! He said he only gave them to the people who asked since there were so limited left. They were pretty good, too :)   The atmosphere is really cool - live birds flying around your head and the whole place looking like a french cafe or village. You can sit \"inside\" or \"outside\" - very delightful. I do wish that there was more than one bathroom! A buffet with only one toilet? There was a super long line in the ladies room. We thought there was complimentary mimosa, but I guess that didn't come with the BoB's.   Overall, not too bad. I did like it more than Rio, but then again, I didn't eat too much.",

From different types of meats, sea food, vegetarian dishes and desserts. I recommend making a reservation because they serve you right away to a table of not you might be waiting in a line like your waiting to get on a ride at a theme park. That's never fun when your starving watching everyone eat delicious food right in front of you.   I love the decor in this restaurant, it has such a Paris feel to it with the painted ceilings and design on the walls and doors. It's picture worthy. Beautiful lighting in this place so you can also attend here for like a dinner date, it does have a romantic feel to it. There recreating a parish feel so of course that would be their gauge.   Also, there's plenty of small shops and bars around and the casino is nearby as well as the Eiffel Tower experience which is an excellent treat right after a delicious dinner!",

They were seating people with larger parties over ours of 4. We were finally seated. It took such a long time for someone to.come to our table to order our drinks we just got up and went to get food. After asking multiple times if a server would be coming,  they kept saying soon. The food on the buffet was pretty mediocre and either the items not available because they didn't bring fresh food out in time or the flavor was not good. The prime rub was bland and very rubbery. The crab legs were so frozen solid even after sitting them on on our table the whole time to thaw while we ate they were still frozen and inedible. The desert table with the creme brulee took almost 20 min for them to restock... Another wait. Definitely WILL NOT ever go back again!",

    "text": "I used to really like this buffet, and I still like the atmosphere here, but it's been going downhill.  The last 2 years I went, the food wasn't quite as good as it used to be.  There are still items that were good.  The prime rib wasn't overcooked, which is great and rare for buffets.  The frozen vanilla custard was delicious.  The made to order crepes are just okay.  They batter isn't that great, and resembles pancake batter.  I like my crepes a little crispier.  Also, I don't like how they put the nutella on the outside, and they put way too much chocolate sauce, so you can't even taste the nutella.  This place specializes in French cuisine, so when you think French, you think amazing breads and cheeses, right?  The bread is always old tasting and lackluster.  It is so disappointing.  As for the crabs-- they are typical fair, except they are cold and hard to open.I prefer warm crab claws.  I prefer this place for breakfast over dinner and lunch.  The selection it pretty good for breakfast.  The Eggs Benedict was way over cooked, and the English Muffin underneath was soggy.  I had one of the muffins, and it was the most disgusting muffing I've ever had.  But they had some good items including a nice assortments of eggs, an omelet station, savory crepes made to order, etc...    Also, the service here used to be great, but I swear, the waitresses are ignoring me on purpose, now.  When they come by the first time, I just got water.  Then, around dessert time, I wanted coffee.  It took me 10 mins. to flag the waitress down.  It was like I was at an Asian cafe back home in LA.  The atmosphere is still great, but service is not what it used to be.",

Come back here much older and much less jaded by Vegas, I can think clearly about how this place actually is.  The GOOD: + I really like how the stations are organized into little french houses/store fronts. It makes the whole atmosphere really cute and unique. I felt like I was getting crepe at a crepe shop and bread at a bread shop. + Food definitely tasted good. They had a large variety of foods for breakfast and lunch.  + Breakfast: make your own crepe station, waffles, biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, ham, sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes, hash brown, and all sorts of dessert items. Lots of things to try and taste. + Lunch: asparagus, prime rib, chicken, 3 different pastas, fish, and all sorts of other stuff.   The BAD: + The line was easily a 2 hour wait any time around breakfast... I felt like there was no good time to go. (Tip: You can pay an extra $10 to cut the line at any time, per person. Also if you have anything above a Diamond card, you can cut the line for free.) +  Breakfast is served till 11 AM... and they will switch on you with NO warning. I was in line for the crepes and was looking forward to getting the rest of my breakfast items but when I got out of line, EVERYTHING was changed from breakfast to lunch.... everything basically just disappeared without warning. After paying to cut the line... I was VERY disappointed by the fact that I couldn't actually eat breakfast...  I think if you plan properly (ie. check times and plan ahead to wait in line or pay to cut), you will enjoy the food here. It's tough getting in, but after that, you can plenty of chances to enjoy a delicious buffet.",

What I did not expect, however, was for the buffet line to have a wait time of 3-4 hours for dinner. Thankfully, we were one of the last few who were able to eat before the buffet closed, but I pity the poor souls who had to wait in line for 2-3 hours and end up not being able to eat at all.  With my grievances about the wait put aside, the price for the buffet is pretty standard as far as buffets go in Vegas, probably a little on the cheaper side. However, the food was mediocre, if even that. I don't know if it's because we were eating right before close time, but the food was getting cold and less stocked. In addition, for being called a \"French\" buffet, the macaroons were subpar.   That being said, the wait staff and chefs were still quite friendly even though they'd had a long day.",

Really sad that this buffet sucks so bad especially for the price you pay.  Luckily we didn't pay or I would have been super annoyed.  I don't understand how there is always a super long line for this buffet.  I would much rather walk to another hotel to get a waaay better Vegas buffet experience.  The food selection is pretty weak.  The one good thing that I had was the Ratatouille and the freshly made crepes.  Other than that, there isn't much that is hot or has decent flavor.  The sushi selection is just laughable.  It was like the \"chef\" took his rolls and threw them into a bowl.  It was embarrassing how the restaurant wouldn't pull that platter to present it in a nicer fashion.  All of the desserts were not labeled so it's a gamble about what you are getting.  I watched some guy grab a dessert plate, put it in his arms against his chest and as the worker told him \"NO!\"  he put the plate back!!!! EWWWWW!   If you see the line at this buffet, please don't think it's because the food is good.  Take the time to go somewhere else!  I promise you that you aren't missing anything.  The Rio Carnaval buffet, Wicked Spoon, and Bacchanal are the top choices for Vegas buffets.",

The Caprese crepe was not made with fresh mozzarella make a note and they put wayyyy too much balsamic so ask for it on the side or to go easy. The whipped cream was amazing as was their sweet crepes, good service would go again and do recommend.",

I hate when people compare buffets to sit down restaurants because they expect that for the cost they get the same quality with unlimited food. Buffets wouldn't exist if that were the case.   However, judging this place for what it is, a buffet, is at the bottom of he list in Vegas. The wife and I did not enjoyed. For the price I would recommend going to the The Buffet at the Wynn.",

It is pretty pricey at $35 each but they gave us a 2 dollar discount for having a players card (really 2 bucks WoW ??? )  Anyway, overall experience was good. We had mimosas with our food which was nice. They had a nice selection of desserts and sweets. Really wanted to try a crepe but was way too full.  Only complaint would be the price.

What the heck?  The desserts were nothing to write home about so don't go for that.  So unimpressive I cannot even remember any of them and I checked them out twice!   The crab legs at dinner were some of the best at a buffet ever!  They were ice cold and not sitting in hot water like I have had so many times, so they were very flavorful and not watered down.  One of my favorite dishes was the creamy pasta with truffle oil!  Yummy flavor!  The service both times was very good.  There was a line but I don't know how long the wait was because I got to skip the lines ;-)  It's a buffet and kinda expensive but what isn't in Vegas?    My recommendation is to only go once to this (and probably any) buffet on your visit to Vegas because the lunch had the exact same food as the dinner minus the crab legs!",

The moment you enter the restaurant, it's like being transported into a small town somewhere in France. Impressive, until you notice all the tables that are so close to one another.   Went around and there is so much food to choose from. Of course I starved myself expecting to be awed by the food and the wine. Here's the verdict:  Wine(Red) - tasted like vinegar :( ...could have used it as a dipping sauce for the crab meat  Food - I love crab legs. They had them but they were still half frozen, no taste and barely had any meat in them. Disappointing. Their mediterranean station was tucked into a corner. The food looked like it's been sitting there forever. Nothing really impressed me except the crepe station. The dessert station had a lot of varieties but only the creme brulee was good.  Our server was nice but seemed overwhelmed.  Would I pay full price to dine at Le Village? No way! It's not even worth the deal we got from groupon.",

They do have some special items that set them apart from others, but I would've liked to try bellagio's buffet instead since everyone keeps raving about it. There is typically a very long wait for dinners, we waited about an hour. Those who work at the cash registers before entering the buffet can be quite rude and ignore you while they talk amongst themselves. They act like that can't see you when you're clearly trying to make eye contact in order to pay. We had a party of four, even though the interior is nice it feels rather cramped. I do however enjoy their creme brulee. Despite being a major crab lover, I stayed away from theirs. The crabs for cold and tasteless.",

They had all the usuals--but the standouts for me were the french onion soup (how appropriate) and the New York Steaks. Aside from the food, I really like the ambiance of the hotel and the restaurant--I admit I am a francophile (or at least wannabe) and this place is very Parisian pretty to me.

The food was good, although the crab was pretty salty and cold. I kind of wish I'd gotten a crepe, seeing as how I was in the Paris hotel and all, but I was trying not to fill up. Maybe my expectations are a little too high, but I thought they could have a little more seafood and dessert variety.",

Macaroons were wayyy over baked. It was crunchy!!! You could hear me biting into it. Anyone who had a legit macaroon can tell you that's not how it supposed to be. From the photo you can see, they had macaroons with mixed color green and red. Not sure what they wanted to achieve, but it looked more like somebody didn't clean the piping bag and just said screw it. Also, the bottom shell was upside down. Maybe someone decided it looked better that way, but totally disagree.",

    "text": "If you're looking for the worst buffet in Vegas, look no further. I had been to this buffet years ago and back then it was amazing. This time, far from it.   There wasn't one edible or semi-good tasting item at this place. To start, half of the food wasn't labeled and the other half was labeled incorrectly. I'm glad I don't have any food allergies or I would have been in serious trouble (although a trip to the ER would have fared better than this buffet). The scrambled eggs were watery and under cooked, the bacon was chewy and sitting in a large puddle of its own grease, the fruit was set out next to the fish so had a fishy taste to it, the macarons were stale, falling apart and filled with whipped cream (how do you mess up a macaron at a FRENCH buffet?), the crepes were filled with canned pie filling rather than fresh fruit, the waffles were ice cold and hard.  Not to mention that everything looked dirty and old as well. The areas around the food bins were filthy and had bits of food all over them.   The waitstaff didn't help the cause either. Everyone was incredibly rude. Bottomless mimosas are included in the price. My friend asked for one while she still had half of a glass in front of her. The waitress told her \"finish that first then I'll get you more\". Thanks mom. Meanwhile, other tables had full bottles of champagne on them.   We were so appalled that we asked for a refund and the manager didn't even blink an eye. To me, that says that he gets complains like this all the time.    Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to go to Wicked Spoon at the Como. Steer clear of this place.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that this was my family's favorite buffet for the last few trips we've made to Vegas.   We didn't eat anything all day in anticipation of the delicious handmade crepes, crab legs, and the various pastries.   We arrived early (5:00pm) and went to the crepe station first, as it used to get a long line.  We were happy to see that there was no line.  Then we discovered the reason.  When my daughter ordered a ham and cheese crepe she was told she had to go find a plate first.   When she returned with a plate from  across the dining room, she again ordered a ham and cheese crepe. The guy told her there was no ham or chicken.  We asked if they were going to have more ham soon, he said no and was quite rude.   Maybe they should have erased those choices from the menu board.    Most dishes around the buffet were unkept, not filled, and some we're unappetizing to look at.  There were crab legs in the serving bowl that should have just been thrown away, unless crab meat is supposed to be yellow.   Now for the desserts.   The macrons were stale, the chocolate chip cookies were never replenished, and we had to ask to even get a creme brulee.     Currently looking for a new favorite buffet :(",

Vegas used to be famous for its extravagant and delicious buffets but after we tried 2 buffets at Le Village and Bacchanal, we gave up. Not only the prices goes up significantly (dinner costs $57.99 per person  on the weekend at Bacchanal), the quality are poor and the selections are quite limited. We came to Le Village for lunch and were quite disappointed. I took my empty plate passing by several food stations before finding something good to eat. The only good options were the prime rib and the crepe station where we could order our own crepe (they have both sweet and savory options). The dessert station looked delicious with all the tempting treats but they were terrible. The macarons were too sweet. I had the eclair but the filling inside was bland and flavorless. The flan and creme brulee were ok but not very exceptional.   We were extremely disappointed at the quality and selections of food at this place. About  $25 per person for lunch is a bit steep compared with the kind of food we got. Not really worth it. We probably will not come back to this place or try any buffet in Vegas again.",

After looking through a few menus, we discovered that the buffet at Paris was only $25 per person for lunch. It was a little bit more than going to a restaurant, but at least we'd have a wide variety of different foods.  Prior to this visit, the last time I ate here was probably a solid 5-6 years ago? It wasn't bad from what I could recall. Last time the line was painfully long, but we were fortunate enough to be able to walk right in and be seated immediately.  Luckily for me it was already lunch time. After a quick look at what they had to offer, the food looked very promising and once I finally fixed up a plate, the food tasted as good as it looked! A few things were a little on the salty side, but overall everything was good.   I'm not going to get into every single detail of everything I ate, but I'd say for $25, it was absolutely worth the price.",

This degraded quality/service has been noticeable for the last few years.   The waiter/waitress staff have been trimmed to the bone and the service was not good at all. We had to wait and wait for someone to pick up our plates so we could get more food. We had to wait and wait for someone to refill our drinks. It was just not good!!!   The food is also not near the quality that it used to be. There are items mentioned on their web that just do not exist anymore. The food didn't seem to be as warm/hot as it should be either. And it seems the desert area has even been trimmed and not as good of quality as it has been in the past.

That was mostly because there was practically no line when I showed up.That should've been a hint.   The buffet felt really limited in their offerings. Two stations had the exact same breakfast items. Even though it was brunch, I didn't see many lunch options. The main saving grace for this place was their to-order crepe station. They offered both sweet and savory crepes. I also tried the tiny crab legs offered, and was pleasantly that there was actually flavor packed in. It could've done with a bit less salt though.   Service was excellent though. Drinks kept coming, even when we didn't ask for it. Dirty plates were picked up quickly as well.   Would I come back though? I think once was enough.",

Then you can walk in through the VIP side with a much shorter wait.  -There is a groupon online, we unfortunately could not use it because of the day we chose to eat brunch, but, it is a great deal to check out before you come. (I think you can only use it on weekends) -Rather than ask for 2 mimosas, ask for champagne and just make your own mimosas at the table. Save your waitress time people.  -If you see the crepe line is 4 people deep or less, run to the line. This line fluctuates and goes pretty slow, because the crepe men are pretty awesome perfecting each one.",

The food was overall pretty bland and dry. Another table also complained about the same thing. The crab legs actually had mold growing on them. However, the worst part was that my grandma got food poisoning. The only things she had that we didn't were a salad and a chicken breast, which she complained tasted off.

Unfortunately, breakfast this time around was not as good as it was compared to my last time there.  I got a little unlucky with their eggs benedict since they were sitting out too long making the eggs not runny.  And the gluten free version too tough that it was almost like a hockey puck. (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2leEUzm&s=1c9b1f65582d6f36ddd1ab1bdf8b5152aaf91531e2ade43bf7dd3c20be287f57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2leEUzm</a>).  I made sure to try their crepe station which is always talked about.  I had their Truffle Mushroom crepe and it was the only saving grace for me.  I thought it tasted pretty good.

Overall, it's hard for me to give Le Village Buffet a higher rating after this experience.  Especially when compared to my breakfast experiences at the higher end buffets on the Strip like Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal.  Fortunately, my mom used her comp dollars for us which softened the blow, but I think those comp dollars could've been put to better use at another restaurant that serves better quality food.",

Although the line up was excruciatingly long, the food was classic french with the egg omlettes, mussels, different meats and a large assortment of different foods! My favourite thing here was their crepes...they were made to order and absolutely delectable! We tried the apple brandy, nutella banana and mushroom truffle and the batter was thin while the filling was plentiful! They were hot and fresh made making up for their absolutely disgusting and rock hard macarons.   Overall, not bad for a buffet!",

We arrived at the beginning of dinner service and most of the food items were old or empty. You would think we had arrived at closing by the amount of food they has available. I walked past the crab legs and there were none. 30 minutes into our meal crab legs arrived and they were horribly salty. Getting a made-to-order crepe was always one of my favorite things from this buffet. However, that too was disappointing. The lady who was making crepes wasn't cooking them all the way so they were under cooked. I tried a fruit tart and it was also pretty bad. The only good thing was the prime rib, however, with the variety of choices for buffets in Vegas I can't say that I recommend this buffet anymore.",

It was fairly pricey in comparison to other buffets and definitely wasn't worth the price we paid. The food was tasteless and the \"service\" was horrible. We didn't have anyone come by our table to take dishes or ask if we were doing okay the entire time we were in there. I had to ask a worker for another fork and he suggested I walk back to the front where the hostess might give me another full setting. Many of the desserts were gone and weren't replenished. We were very disappointed in the food and service, the price was way too high for what we received (or lack there of). Save your money and skip out on this buffet.",

Now I'm afraid it has gone WAY downhill. Prime rib and lamb were overdone and tough. Cold mussels. Gone are the interesting beef Bourguignon and similar delicacies. You could be at any buffet now, minus the Asian, Mexican and Italian areas. It is that nondescript. Many of the identifying placards were missing so you didn't know what you were eating. Maybe a good thing in retrospect.  Waiter picked up dishes but never refilled water, certainly no offer of coffee. No eye contact on leaving, no \"thank you\". No wonder the self-serve beverage stations are all the rage now.  There were some highlights, a nice herb tilapia for instance. And the atmosphere is still charming. But if you have been here in years past you will notice the difference.  The biggest sin is that they shut off and shut down \"le rotisserie\" section which made steaks and chops to order. (To make room for a new \"sekushi sushi\" eatery.) Even the crab legs were picked over and small. Ugh. And twelve bucks to park on top of it? Poor value here. Do yourself le faveur and try AYCE at the Palms instead. You'll save a ton and be happier.",

We fly to Vegas often and Le Buffet at Paris was a favorite for one simple reason, the excellent service. Thanks to corporate greed that's no longer True. All of their exceptional wait staff have been relegated to simple bus boys. Everything is now self-serve. I can self-serve at home and I don't need to spend hundreds of dollars and fly thousands of miles to do it.  One of our favorite servers was Roxanne. Roxanne if you reading this, you are an exceptional.  Please leave Paris and go where your attitude, hard work and amazing customer service is appreciated, not just by your customers, peers and managers but also the bean counters who recognize that not everything can be quantified in dollars and cents. We won't be back until Paris realizes the error of their ways.",

This place is terrible and mismanaged. The food is so gross and they barely have any good options. The crepes are the main attraction and even that is sub par. There was even a fucking bug by the guy making the crepes. Also people were tipping in right near the food. Like it cool that they want to give him stuff but they really had to put gross money right next to the fruits and crepe toppings?! I could not even go through my ham and cheese crepe. I am sure places like this can only go downhill unless there is a serious renovation. Also they made the macaron wrong which irritated the hell out of me.",

We waited around an hour to get in (Thursday around 10am) and when we finally got in, the selection was astounding.  They have every kind of breakfast food you could want (American, French, and English) and the made to order crepe kitchen was our favorite! Best crepe I've ever had. Food was good quality, even the eggs tasted better than normal buffet style eggs.   The atmosphere was so cool!! It felt like we were in France, on a quaint little street. The service was amazing, our waitress was very attentive and I swear was trying to get me drunk with all the unlimited mimosas!!   Next time I'm in Vegas, we will definitely be coming back. Amazing!!",

Last time we were here was some years back and we actually recalled that this buffet was a good one. However, this time around was exactly the opposite. This buffet is one of the semi-pricey one on the strip but the hot crab legs was my wife's favorite that's why we visited the place once again. We were totally disappointed with what we saw. We had to wait at least 10 minutes to get a clean plate as the plate racks were TOTALLY EMPTY. The person replenishing the plates said they were undermanned and overworked in the back house. There were plenty of empty trays on the food line and the cooks were saying the same excuse, that there are only 5 cooks to feed everybody. I talked to one cook named Roger and I even took his picture and asked him why the Salmon has been out for at least 20 minutes and he said that MANAGEMENT does not want them to put out certain products too quickly. Also Roger said that there are only 5 cooks for the whole buffet on duty that particular time and they can only do so much. There was a line waiting for the Salmon and it really was disappointing that you pay this extravagant price and have to wait 20 minutes plus to get your food. The place was dirty - no one was cleaning after spills and the food line had a lot of EMPTY DISHES. Even the FRUITS were empty. The dessert portion was also too little for choices. I CAN TRULY SAY THAT PARIS LE VILLAGE BUFFET HAS GONE DOWN FROM ITS STANDARDS FROM THE LAST TIME WE ATE HERE. CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT MANAGEMENT SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR PUTTING OUT SUCH A LOW QUALITY PRODUCT AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO PAY PREMIUM PRICE. THE EMPLOYEES ARE SHOWING DISCONTENT BY THE WAY THEY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THROWN AT THEM WHY IT'S TAKING SO LONG TO REPLENISH THE EMPTY PANS ON THE SERVING LINE.",

We were only able to visit the Flamingo for breakfast, Harrah's for lunch, and Paris' buffet for dinner twice. Caesars' Bacchanal was an additional $20-$30 upgrade fee, which technically means you were paying the regular breakfast/lunch and dinner fee. The Paris buffet had your standard Vegas buffet items: they had prime rib (which was my favorite!), glazed ham and pork, sushi, fried rice, fried chicken, crab legs...you name it lol. They also have a crepe station where you can ask for sweet or savory crepes, so of course I went ham on the Nutella. All the hot foods were hot, and the cold foods cold which is a good sign!

Citrus and any acidic juice help the digestive process. :)  Breakfast and dinner are best here.   Here are my favorite items for both breakfast and dinner:  - Crepes (handmade right before you) - Waffles (also before you) - Omelettes - Bouillabaisse (not sure on the spelling, excuse me) - Green beans - Desserts! Pastries, pie, and mousse galore! Divine! This is their specialty!  There are a lot of French specialties for dinner, which is really nice, and the layout of the buffet is super-nice. The different stations are set up to represent a different region of France (Bordeaux, Nice, Provence, etc.) and of course, different parts of the meal (salad, dessert, main courses, sides...)  Of course, they have many buffet staples, which were also delicious.  The decor is lovely, it feels like you're in a Parisian courtyard. Beautiful. The sky is always blue and clear here.

I'm not sure what has happened, but its just not the same quality food or atmosphere. We did go later in the evening, about an hour before they closed, but this shouldn't excuse the poor presentation of trays and food basically scattered all over them or the fact it seemed as if there were only two or three employees arounds besides the servers. I could have gotten over this if it weren't for the crepe station. I love going to the Creperie they have across from the buffet, and since they offer the same crepes in the buffet you'd assume they would be the same quality. You'd be wrong. I understand that they need to get crepes out quickly, but making them so quickly that the cheese in a ham and cheese crepe does not have time to melt? Not really worth waiting 15 minutes for it. I wish it was still as good as it has been in the past, but it just isn't.",

    "text": "Le Village was my first top in the Buffet of Buffets.   The major standouts at Le Village were the prime rib, the pesto pasta, the custard vanilla ice cream, and the flan.   The prime rib was very tender, very juicy, and cooked seemingly just right. There was enough flavor within the meat and the au jus that no horse radish was needed.   The pesto pasta was probably the best pesto I've had outside of my own kitchen. Granted, my exposure to pesto sauces is not too vast, but I'd say that Le Village did this one solid. There was solid flavor, they used a good amount of garlic and pine nuts, the pasta was a perfect texture.  The flan was pretty delicious although I typically like my flan more dense than light. My guests concurred that the flan was of a good texture. The custard vanilla ice cream was very thick and dense and the added 'oomph' of the custard made for an extremely thick and smooth feel. Good anchor to the rest of the meal.  And that's pretty much where the good stuff ended. Everything else was your seemingly generic Vegas buffet offerings. One thing to stay away from was the Mediterranean selection section. The lamb was jerky, all of the kabobs, hummus, and dolmas have been sitting out for wayyy too long and you could just tell to stay away. I gave it a shot and sadly regretted it.  Our server was very strategic. Always gone when we needed her, always present when not. Granted, all we really needed was refills on our drinks and plates to be removed when done, but she just seemed to be a little inefficient in her service.  Overall, Le Village may be the best, if not, the 2nd best offering in the Buffet of Buffets selections. Aside from the dishes that I praised above, nothing else really stood out.",

The line was insanely long, but the experience was made better by a girl who was with her boyfriend and was constantly checking me out :-) The food choices are not very vast, they are small by comparison to other buffets.   The lighting is quite dim overall in the main area. The one thing I enjoyed was the Mac and Brie Cheese with bits of bacon. Other than that I didn't really enjoy their offerings. Because I stuffed myself with the mac and cheese, I didn't leave room for dessert, but seeing as how they are a french place, you would think the offerings would be more exotic.",

I was surprised that the dessert selection wasn't as extensive as I thought it was going to be.

    "text": "In the first few years after Paris opened, Le Village Buffet was one of the finest buffets in Vegas.  In the past three or four years, there has been a sharp nosedive in quality.   The queue before entering is inexcuable.  Even if there are many tables available, they make parties wait at least fifteen minutes regardless.  The excuse was that there were no wait staff available.  However you can see the wait staff chatting with each other so it wasn't as if they were busy helping customers or prepping tables.  There was even one waitress who just stood around and watched and did little to supervise or coordinate.    Wait staff is extremely unattentive.  Was there almost two hours but only got drinks refilled twice.  Again, too busy conversing with each other to help patrons.  Really poorly managed and unacceptable customer service.    Food quality and variety also has taken a turn for the worse.  Entrees and desserts used to have a French or European flair.  The food now is average buffet fare that can be had anywhere else and at better quality.     This buffet is still better than other buffets around the country but in Las Vegas, a buffet needs to be on top of their game to compete and Le Village is no longer a destination buffet.  Green Valley, Spice Market, and Rio all surpass the Le Village and time in Vegas is too short to waste at Le Village.",

I guess you can't compare it to the Bellagio buffet.  I should have known when they rang me up at the front for about ~$27.  I looked over to my friend and said, the food can't be really good if they charge that small amount.  The desserts were horrible, who would offer dry bread pudding, ick.

This is definitely the place to go on Sunday AM while in Vegas :-)  A group of 5 of us waited ~ 45 mins in line, but we were chatting the entire time, so it wasn't all that bad.  Our waitress was on-the-ball with the mimosas, and clearing plates, and pretty nice about it too the entire time.  Food went from mediocre to good to very tasty!  The quiche was eh, and I hate peel-and-eat shrimp (SO messy!), and the creme brulee was abdominal. The baked sole was fantastic as always, as were the dolmades and smoked salmon (but no toast or bread nearby to put it on?). They were out of Nutella for the crepes, so I downgraded to plain ol' chocolate, but it was that yucky, bland, overly-sweet Nestle stuff, I think.  Didn't end up eating it, but the whipped cream was amazing. Pan a' chocolate was a bit dry. Sushi was a small selection, but all were made very well, fresh, and great flavours - good job, sushi chef! The pesto pasta with pine nuts was very flavourful and good textures, as was the marinated mushroom salad. And, the piece de resistance - they have soft serve ice cream!!  (They call is frozen custard = same thing).  We all came out of there happy, full, tipsy, and ready for more.",

For $30 a person, I think you can get a better dinner elsewhere. The highlights for me was the salmon (perfectly seasoned), the tri-tip (juicy!!!), the seasoned vegetables, asparagus, pita bread (freshly baked out of the oven!), and the chicken.   They had a crepe station and it was good, but not amazing. You can get a better crepe across the buffet at Le creperie!   The really bad things were the prime rib and turkey. The slice of prime rib they gave me on my plate was so bloody it filled my plate with blood and got into all my other food servings...so I had to throw the plate out. It was pretty disgusting. That prime rib was way too rare! And the turkey was not cooked all the way! they took it out of the oven too early and was clearly evident when I took a bite of it. I told the chef that the turkey wasnt done, but he just said okay and continued to serve it to people. I wasn't the only one to complain about it, yet they continued to serve it. If they were receiving complaints, they should have removed it immediately. So i was not impressed by this at all.   So even though I enjoyed some of their entrees, i wouldn't say its worth the $30! And the wait for this buffet was ridiculous so I thought it was gonna be way more amazing!",

Main dishes were also mislabeled. Two dishes each labeled \"bouilliabaise\" did not look similar. When asking the cooks behind the counters what certain items were, they either did not know, or did not understand the question (in English). Peel and eat shrimp went empty for a while. (For $30. the shrimp should already be peeled.) The serving counters in front of the foods had food scattered all over them, and were not cleaned often enough. We were NEVER asked if we wanted refills of our iced teas, and had to flag someone down for coffee at the end. I hate to think how much worse it got at \"normal\" dinner time, after we left.

Their Brunch Buffet is much more of a standout.  Therefore I'm rating it 4 stars for what i remember of the Brunch buffet and not rating dinner as very good, at least compared  to other buffets on the strip like the Wynn and Bellagio. Brunch, however, is a standout. Get in line early though! And no matter what, prepare to stand in line for a while- their service is slow and understaffed! Happened both times i went to this eatery.,   Just think French Breakfast and that that should get your mouth drooling. I miss how I had unlimited champagne for a time period which was included in the brunch package. And at that time, there were yummy berry platters and amazing cheeses.  Dont bother with the fruit crepes, however! The buffet uses canned fruits which make the crepes soggy and unappetizing.  Instead,  go across to Le Creperie which uses real fruits and the batter of the crepe tastes amazing!.   Other good dishes at dinner:  they had a beef tips dish that was really yummy and excellent grilled veggies. And as always, the flan is SO good!",

With our group of 5 half of us walked thru the mall shops and 2 others waited in line (I was one of the lucky ones that got to shop). When we were finally inside there were so many things to choose from, I tried a little bit of what appealed to my low carb diet, which was plenty. Prime rib, steak, grilled veggies, crab legs, and the list goes on. I killed my diet when I came accross the made to order crepes which were heavenly, and I guess well worth ruining my diet for one day.  The girls all loved it too, they (we) all made pigs of ourselves here.  Good times.",

The lunch buffet was $25, half of Caesar's and we felt it was every bit as luxurious \"looking\".  There were no plates for us at the dessert bar--which equals kids grabbing and eating at the bar and people repeat visiting for single items.  A delicious looking grilled zucchini slice turned out to be an ice cold dish not a hot vegetable.  Prime rib had better flavor than roast beef or tri-tip but nice they offered all 3.  Signs were still up of breakfast foods so you were left guessing what you might be selecting.  Lots of nice flavors.  Superior crepe station for savory or sweet.  Great creme brulee & flan.  Desserts were at \"low tide\" so selections seemed sparse when we were there.  I did not overeat but had a stomach ache all afternoon.   We felt we got our money's worth (paid the same as for most single entree dishes in nice restaurants) but also that there were things that could improve.",

    "text": "The Le Village buffet at the Paris hotel was only \"ok\" but not suitable for kids.  They have a crepe station, duck confit and roast chicken, cream of spinach and mash Yukon potatoes, seafood, pasta (Mac and cheese, truffle pasta penne, and pesto penne), carving station (beef and roast turkey), salad, and desserts.  We went around dinner time.  The price was 32.99 or so for adults and 21.99 for kids.  There were fish and shellfish ( crab legs, clams, shrimp).  I felt the buffet did not have enough choices as some of the ones I had tried on the strip.  Although most buffets are not worth it for kids, I recommend not bringing the kids here as there is not much kids would like to eat.  There are other better buffets which have many more choices for adults and kids and for the same price or even less expensive.  I do not see much to rave about.  Adults would probably enjoy it more but not as many choices (even desserts were limited with flan, macaroons, yogurt, chocolate cake, and cheesecakes) as some of the ones I have visited.",

Looks like a little French town. I didn't feel like they had much selection for its price, but I did try the:  mashed potatoes: SO GOOD. SO CREAMY. SO BUTTERY. duck: pretty good! roasted beef: it was alright. turkey: dry  sausage: good and juicy! crepe with nutella: warm and gooey creme brulee: not too great steamed fish: delicious as well  ...among other items I cannot recall at this particular moment. It would have been worth $20 but not ~$30.I suppose the only reason it costed more was its unlimited champagne.

    "text": "Of the 3 buffets (Village Seafood at Rio, Planet Hollywood, and Paris) I went there during my Buffet of Buffets 24-hour run, this was my favorite because of the ambiance and pretty fresh variety of food.  We went for breakfast/lunch at 11 am.  We got in about 40 minutes later and stayed until 1 pm.  I really enjoyed the variety of foods here, especially the large selection of desserts.  I went directly first to the crepe line, since I know it's popular.  It was pretty good, but very sweet.  You get to pick what goes in your crepe, and I chose blueberries, strawberries, and banana.  Only the banana was fresh.  The berries were just preserves.  Someone asked if they had fresh berries/fruit, and the lady (1 lady making tons of crepes for everyone in line), said they hadn't had fresh fruit in a while.   I then went over and looked at the desserts and got an omelet made.  It was a standard omelet with nothing exciting, though the guy who made our omelets was really friendly.  I LOVE seafood and was very pleasantly pleased to find a lox (cream cheese and smoked salmon on a bagel) station.  There were bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers.  I loaded my plate and really enjoyed my lox more than anything else.  I wish I had room to eat more of it, but I sadly discovered this station at the end.  I thought it was pretty cool that they also had a little Mediterranean station.  I was too full by then to try anything from there.  And by about noon, I saw people started stacking their plates with crab legs for lunch. Not sure if they had those out earlier, but I sure didn't notice people with them during my first round.  I stuck to the breakfast stuff, since I could only get that once a day.    I don't know why, but I really liked this place a lot.  The food wasn't super unique, but the people who served at the stations were really nice.  I also loved the ambiance.  Some buffets look super old and outdated.  This one was nice and felt more cozy.  Though it's not Paris, it did remind me a lot of my visit to Paris (which may also be why I liked this place).  I would definitely go there again for breakfast, even without the Buffet of Buffets card.",

This review details my experience for the Sunday brunch ($27.99) which I only paid half because I had a BOGO coupon.    The Slightly Good:  Prime rib = slightly overcooked.  Crab legs = average, but tasted a day old. AYCD mimosas: after the first mimosa, the refills were champagne in the champagne glass and orange juice in a separate cup.  I'm not sure why I had to make my own.  At least you can take your last glass outside.  The Bad:  All the breakfast foods.  Seriously, how do you mess up hash browns, scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausages, waffles, etc??  Mostly everything was a little off and my whole party of 9 agreed.    Maybe all the food was off because I was here during the transition (brunch) but that's still no excuse.  I will never be patronizing this place again on my own volition nor recommending this buffet to any friends I like.",

The food wasn't bad, but I didn't sense the quality. I also expected much more variety. I felt there was too much of the typical, cheap, hot breakfast buffet food. They did have crab legs and carving stations and other meats and goodies, which was decent. I was super happy they had a crepe station, but the line was so long, by the time I got to the front, they ran out of the fruit I wanted! =(  The bottomless bubbly with my buddies redeemed my afternoon :) Gold stars for our wonderful server!

Which was cool because buffets in Vegas are ridiculous in prices but some are worth going to. The brunch food was pretty good, getting a variety of breakfast and lunch meals which ever you would prefer to eat all breakfast or all lunch. There were biscuit and gravy, different kinds of eggs plates, bacon, sausage. You name it they have it. They also have a different line which can be crazy long for crepes. They have all kinds of crepes nutella with bananas, berries, etc. The dinner we had was quite good. Just like any buffet you get a pretty large selection of food. I would say you give it a try.

Noticed a huge line when we left at 10 a.m.  I'm not sure what else I had or how it tasted, because I can only think of the Crepe that I ate.  The wait for the crepe was ridiculous!!!!  Only one person was making the crepes & finally a second person came out.  However, only one person was standing there for the most part.  These 2 people had to refill the ingredients & kept going back to kitchen for who knows what---there should be 3 people making crepes & a fourth one refilling stuff to get the line moving.  I think I waited longer for the crepe than I did outside.  Anyhow, I didn't know what crepe to order, since I never had one.  I went with the \"monkey,\" since I noticed everyone was ordering this.  This is one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life!!!!!!  My husband had to tell me to slow down & chew.  LOL  This crepe has bananas, with Nutella sauce, candied hazelnuts, and whipped cream!!!!!  I ate this after having eggs and who knows what else (can't remember).  The crepe served as dessert.  I wish I would have ate this first, because the line would have been shorter.  This MONKEY CREPE deserves FIVE STARS.  All the other breakfast items are just o.k.& not worth the $20 something charge for breakfast.  We had the buffet of buffet pass, so that's why we went here.  Next time, I'm going to try to find a crepe place and skip the buffet.  *My husband didn't even taste the crepe and said the other breakfast items were the best he has tasted for breakfast.  I still only give it 3 stars & 5 for the crepe.",

From what I saw of the regular breakfast menu selections that were available when we were seated, I'm not sure I would have paid more than $10-15 for it as it was just generic run of the mill breakfast items with a few exceptions...but the champagne brunch?  So much good food to start the day with...the only thing that's a bummer with Vegas buffets, especially the good ones is that with so much to sample from, it's impossible to try everything and that was the case here.  I could have eaten more, but I just had to save room for the desserts and pastries which as would be expected from a French themed place were top notch.

I don't know what it is about pesto, it's a sauce that really doesn't have too much flavor but whenever I see it on a menu I've just got to have it.  And this is the one buffet that always has it.  I always get a big plateful of it and pair it up with some sausage and broiled veggies.  Ok, that's the other thing this place always does right, the vegetables.  I know it's really simple, but they must use some really fresh eggplant and peppers (the green, orange, red, and yellow types) because they always taste so good.  The rest of the foods here are pretty good but nothing stands out.  They have what appears to be a decent seafood section but their crabs are always eh, very small and thin crab legs with stringy meat.  Dessert selection is decent and the decor is very cute.

    "text": "I've only been there once and it was about a year and a half ago. I searched to see if it has been remodeled since I was last there and I cannot find any info saying so, so I'm assuming that it is the same since I last went there.  My brother came to visit from out of town and for some reason he heard that this place was good and wanted to try it out. Being a local, I'm rarely impressed with what the strip casino buffets offer compared to the local casinos because they all pretty much serve the same foods but the strip buffets are twice as expensive and twice as crowded. In this case both still stand True.   First off, the wait to get in was about an hour and a half! Luckily I wasn't the one that had to wait in line so I just went to the casino and played while I waited for his call. Finally after an hour and a half he hit the front of the line and it was finally time to eat.   The first thing I noticed was the layout and design of the buffet. It is supposed to look like some French street market or whatever and there's the main dining floor which had like cobblestone paths or whatever and there were like little \"rooms\" on the sides which was where we were seated. It's a horrible theme and completely bad layout. The rooms looked like little village shops or something and had space for about 4 tables with about 20 seats or so but it's just a horrible design. My biggest complain about that is that if all of those walls were knocked down and all of the rooms were eliminated, they could probably seat another 200 people at any given time, which would alleviate, the wait in the line but getting more people in at once. I could see the rooms being a nifty little idea, especially if you're filling up that room with your own party but when there's 5 other parties in there, it's not so great. The rooms are somewhat isolated and are fairly quiet and it's not so fun hearing the other family's kids yelling and not having the buzz of the restaurant drowning it out.   The food  The food was nothing nothing special really. I honestly don't remember much about the food. It wasn't anything different than what I could have gotten from a local casino but for half the price. I think the cost was like $40 per person for a dinner buffet and for what we got, it was not worth it at all.    One thing I do remember is that the flow of the buffet was not good. People just kept cutting in front of me and had no clue on where the flow of the buffet line was and every time I went up to the buffet, I would come back aggravated and annoyed with how much side stepping I had to do to get from point a to point b.   Overall, I'd say stay away. For the money you're better off going to a nice place and ordering a decent meal opposed to going to a tourist buffet.",

They pulled groups of 4 or 5 out of line from behind us several times and let them go in ahead of us and they all got breakfast.

The other stand out dishes includes the roasted veggies (lots of options) and the pork with apples.  It didn't look appetizing, so I passed over it at first.  Glad I listened to the boys.  Best mashed potatoes ever!  Lots of pasta options, most of them bland.  They had real French macaroons and, of course, creme brulee.  Mini lemon meringues.  I would have been happy at a restaurant with a few of their options, so being able to have all of them plus a ton of creme brulee was worth the buffet price.  We had the unlimited wine, beer, champagne, or mimosas.  We figured that $12 per person for unlimited drinks was the price of, at most, 2 drinks in Vegas so we made sure we got our money's worth.   We would go back and were glad we missed breakfast and had lunch at Le Village instead.  It does look very Disney but that's better than crappy decor, I think.",

The line outside this buffet made me optimistic, but when I saw that the lines didn't end once we were in the buffet, I was a little annoyed. My bf and I hardly saw each other during our breakfast together because I spent a good 15 minutes in line for an omelet. The selection of breakfast foods was not as big as I thought it would be. My omelet was good, but nothing else was really memorable except for the churros, which I'm pretty sure the French don't eat for breakfast, but it was good nonetheless. There were a lot of fruit, cheeses, croissants, and even pate, but that didn't make up for our forgetful waitress. There is also a crepe station, but I wasn't a huge fan of the blueberry crepe.",

    "text": "I really liked the buffet at the Paris, but then again I don't know if I would be the best judge because I stuck to only a few items on the buffet line.  But, for what it's worth, I really enjoyed the few items I got!  I got two large serving of the roasted lamb and mint jelly.  The lamb was nicely seasoned and so juicy.  On the side I had 3 kinds of potatoes: glazed fingerling-sized sweet potatoes, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and leek mashed potatoes--all were really delicious.  I was also excited to see that they offered stone crab claws that day.  Even though I never tried them before, I could tell that the quality were not the greatest.  But hey, I was just excited to eat multiple bowls!  I didn't get to make a crepe or omelet at their respective stations, but I liked the idea of having both available.  The only downside was the service which started off being inconsistent but gradually improved as the meal progressed.  Between the crab legs, the lamb, the champagne, and the fact that it all cost under $30 with tip (which is a lot cheaper than the Bellagio), i would say that I had a really good experience at Le Village Buffet and I hope that I will have the chance to come back.",

I went here Sunday afternoon, having researched which buffet to go to on the magical Buffet of Buffets pass and decided on this one. The line was long, horribly long....two hours long. Once inside the waitress took my drink order promptly, FINALLY SERVICE AT LAST. Refilled my drinks ten minutes later, and then vanished for the rest of my meal.   When I was in line I was looking over the menu they have posted and noticed they had delicious duck on the menu. This excited me naturally. Who cares about a two hour wait when there is mouth watering duck. My imagination went wild with excitement. Then once inside in lines scouring the buffet for duck I quickly realized there was none. THERE WAS NO GODDAMN DUCK. My heart sank and then the resentment grew. The food was blah. I was eating just because I didn't want to admit that I wasted my afternoon sitting in line for a buffet that is slightly better than Home Town Buffet.",

    "text": "We came at 3:15 pm on a Sunday, which was interesting because they change their menu from brunch to dinner. (Coincidentally, they charged us the dinner rate at $30 instead of $18). Brunch, by the way, included all-you-can-drink champagne. Yay! The food was good. In fact, it was above average for a buffet. But here's the thing - where is the French food? As far as I could tell, here is what they had that might qualify - French Onion Soup, Eggs Benedict, Crepes, and Creme Brulee. Yes, its True that (I've always been told), cooking French food takes time, care and a wee bit of TLC, but come on - there's got to be a few dishes that they could add to the menu. If space is an issue, try taking away the sushi area (which is the one areas of the buffet that is kind of sad, actually). Not all buffets need to be all things to all people, but should have a certain consistency.  Help us out Vegas - if all the buffets verge on being the same - why don't I just go to the least expensive one? Anyways, I agree with the other yelpers - they definitely could have a better system for drinks. Nevertheless, our server was nice and attentive. No complaints there.  Overall, 3.5 stars. Not bad, not great. Just buffet.",

The host sat us down and told us to wait for the server to get our drinks. So, like well-behaved students we sat...and waited...and waited some more for our waitress to come over. I was literally watching her as she went from empty table to empty table to set up the plates and utensils when literally there were other customers in the room who needed tending to. There weren't even new customers going to those tables that were being set up. We waited about 15 minutes before she randomly came over with juice and iced tea to our table which we did not even order. It took about another 20 minutes before we were even served water and coffee, but no coffee cups. Once the room started to become filled, she took everyone else's order first, before coming to our table to finally ask what we wanted to drink even though we were there before about 90% of the other tables. It was just SOOO ridiculous.  The previous time we came about 6 months prior, we had the same lady. She gave us attitude when we wanted 1 champagne and 1 juice for each person.  I don't understand why it was such a big issue when in the end she just gave us a jug of each. So simple, yet she had to make such a big deal out of it. Then, throughout the entire meal, she was giving us the stink eye.  Food-wise: I would say it's just average. There's not a huge selection like Spice Market or Bacchanal. There was nothing that really stood out to me.  Tip: If you do decide to come here, try to get a table that's not in the middle room, preferable a table in the main area. Service has always been better there. If you get seated in the middle room beg to be moved elsewhere. You've been warned!",

We have a party of 16 (I have a huge filipino family, and this was only a small portion of them). It takes at least 45 minutes to get into the buffet. Understandable. They seat us together and are very friendly.   The only thing I wanted at this buffet was the creme brulee. I've been to this buffet THREe times and have always gotten their creme brulee because it's freaking DELICIOUS. WELL, the buffet \"closes\" at 10pm. I THINK that means they stop letting people in at 10. Well I think it ALSO means that they stop cooking at 10 because when I went up to the dessert island to get my creme brulee, they were OUT and not making anymore.  UM NO. If my family is gonna pay 25+ dollars per person, you BETTER have some freaking creme brulee because it's the best dessert on your dessert island. Don't let people into your buffet if you are going to run out of food. You are a BUFFET so you should continue making your food, even if you are closing.  DO NOT come here anywhere near closing time. Even an hour ahead of time isn't early anough. You will be extremely disappointed when they start running out of food. DEFINITELY not worth your money, believe me. :/",

    "text": "I could eat crepes in this little parisian village all day long!   My two favorite things about this buffet:  the crepe station and the atmosphere.  I've eaten here twice, but the first time was on the last day of my bachelorette party years ago and I don't remember a whole lot... ;)  This last time we went during our Buffet of Buffets experience (which I promise I'll review...soon) and I'd have to say it was my favorite buffet of them all.  We went for breakfast and I'm not a big breakfast person, so they had already started off at a disadvantage through no fault of their own!  We stood in line for a good while but once we got close to being seated and I could take in the full effect of the ambiance, my mood transformed!  How cute IS this place?!  The food is set up at little village \"cafes\" where you can choose from the selection of food.  We were seated in a little \"cottage\" off to the side...adorable.  The food selection ranged from your basic breakfast buffet foods...eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, various types of potatoes etc.  There was an omelette bar, which I did not take advantage of because I was quite happy with my egg, mushroom, tomato scramble.  After my first plate of \"typical\" breakfast choices, I headed straight for the crepe station.  The line was substantial (I started to worry our server would clear our table thinking we'd left), but I was entertained by watching the crepes being made (now that's a talent I'd like to master!).  There are many choices...to make it easy to order, they organized the menu into savory (hearty meal-like) and sweet (more dessert-like).  You can also customize your order if none of the menu items tickle your fancy.  I went with the fruity berry one and my husband went with the banana and Nutella one.  Both were magnificently delicious!  Pretty too!  I'll have to search for some pics that I took...  Our service was decent.  Honestly, I was up and down so much getting food I didn't really have much need for anything.  She kept my juice replenished and I have no complaints.  The real experience was just the summation of it all.  It's hard to put my finger on it...but I felt a certain degree of \"special\" from this place...and that's why it gets the 5 stars from me.",

Back to the restaurant, the line wasn't long at 11 am and we were seated within 10 mins. The restaurant, of course, has a French theme. Although tables and chairs were cafeteria like set up. Good selection of food including; traditional breakfast items, meat carving,made to order crepe station, Mexican, seafood (crab legs, shrimp etc...) and dessert. So.. Why only 2 stars? Food was not impressive. To be honest, it was on per with cruise ship buffet.

I didnt find any traditional french dishes in this buffet. It was your typical buffet garbage. Prime Rib, Crab Legs that looked like they've seen better days, turkey loaf. etc..

I loved their clams, shrimps, pork belly, and some kind of pasta and mushrooms in cream sauce. The crepes, you must try! We shared three crepes at our table and my favorite was number 2 (with lots of berries). Also, the macarons are not the best I have had but they are good. They are just a tad bit sweeter than I would like them to be!  The only negative thing about this buffet was the slow service. If you are someone who just cannot stand this aspect of a dining experience, I would not recommend going here. But your waitresses will get to your table and you will be well on your way to having one of the best buffets of your life!  Overall, I love le village for their food and the french atmosphere. I would recommend!  Another tip: Use groupon! we were a party of 3 and used groupon deal for 2 ppl ($35) and normal price for 1 person ($29). Pretty cheap for a quality buffet!",

    "text": "$27 for dinner. About 8pm last saturday night there was about an hour wait. The place was crowded, so much so that it seemed a little dirty, like they couldn't tidy up fast enough.    The bad: The ginger ale tasted extremely watered down.  The stone crab claws were already cracked somewhat, but I tried a few different ones and was unsuccessful at getting anything OUT of them and also managed to slice my finger open trying. Friend got some of the snow crab legs, but they just looked soggy and aged to me.  I was excited to see the brie and bacon mac and cheese, but was promptly disappointed by the quality.  The decent:  The lamb was good and not gamey. Crepe station was pretty neat- long wait, and not Spectacular, but worth it.  Overall, I don't remember a darn thing about this food. So very unremarkable.  and the good:  the reason this place gets 2 stars is the Creme Brulee!!! I lucked out and snagged some, but a friend went to get dessert and came back without, saying the chef was caramelizing the tops and they weren't out yet. I went back to try the remaining desserts and she asked me to pick her up a creme brulee, but they were out again by that time.  Caesar's buffet is the same price and I'd recommend that. We had been there 3 weeks prior, about the same time (8pm Saturday night) and there was no wait.",

I gotta admit, I usually try to eat somewhat healthy and so I get a salad somewhere in my plates but this time I passed on salad to make room for all the tasty food & deserts! They have a wide variety of seafood, meats, soups, pasta, veggies, bread, deserts, a crepe bar, macaroons.. The guy next to us ate like 6 plates of crab legs so I guess those were pretty good ( I thought they were ok..)  The place is so lovely as well! It feels like you are having a romantic dinner in Paris on a quiet evening...   Oh, heed the warnings people!

I warned my husband earlier that Dec 26th morning that we should get a reservation due to a possible long line... We were in a rush that morning so we waited until afternoon to make a reservation...  we didn't realize that you need to make the reservation BEFORE noon so it was too late. Oh well we thought , it can't be THAT bad... When we saw the line of people winding around ropes like they were making line for a roller coaster, I looked at my husband and gave him the \"I told you look\"....trust me!!

    "text": "Summer of 2002, after watching an episode of Season 1 American Idol, we got into my car and drove to Vegas.  This was about 11 at night.  My car got a flat tire outside of Baker.  We got to Vegas just in time for the Paris buffet to open.  Despite that mess and how awful that last minute trip should have been, with little purpose save crazy college adventuresome spirit, all I can really remember is how great the breakfast buffet was.    Every trip since then, I've gone back to Paris for the breakfast buffet.  It's like coming to a little slice of home- I know where various of my favorite foods are (the pears in wine are great, and the crepes are obviously fabulous).  I love the kitschy-yet-nice decor too.  Up until this weekend, it was a solid 5 star review in my book.  So then this weekend we go there.  And it just didn't live up to my memory.  It was pretty much the same- the decor, the selection, etc.  I think it was just a particularly busy day with some confusion as to whether a line was for an omelet or for just buffet-style scrambled eggs/bacon; maybe it was that we had to get there before 11 in order not to have to pay for the champagne brunch (at Bellagio we got to choose whether we wanted champagne or not); maybe it was that the selection of what you could have in your crepe was kind of lacking now that I've become rather obsessed with crepes; I'm not sure.  It was still great, and I'd still go back.  The price (around 15 for breakfast) is waaay better than the Bellagio, but I have to say, the Bellagio's food was superior on pretty much all counts (save them not having a crepe bar).  But still, many a good memory here and the food (and incredible selection) was way better than most breakfast buffets I've been to in my time.     Also, if you go on Sunday (maybe Saturday too), and get there before 11, you can pay the cheaper price and eat some of the nicer food they put out for the expensive champagne brunch.  Always a plus.",

The lines were too long outside and as well as inside the buffet that by the time you got to the food you want, they had already run out.  I went back to check and they had replaced it with an entirely different dish!  A few years ago, the food was way better and what I remember most was the crepe section.  Blueberry and whip crepe.....mmmmm, but this time it tasted yucky..what happened?? I could've sworn I saw someone eating chocolate dipped strawberries, but I never saw it at the dessert station, so I opted for the creme brulee, which I must say, is not bad.  And they ran out of Italian dressing for salad.  What the???",

Anyway.  Look.  I judge this buffet on French food.  Because it is a \"French\" theme buffet.  Some people would say, Carlos Jr what about the snow crab legs on ice and the sushi (which by the way sucks at all Harrahs buffets).  I would then say.  I could eat crablegs at any of the Harrahs dinner buffets and even the Lago for lunch.  Why go to a French theme buffet for Crablegs. Folks the Crablegs were the only thing good here.  I tried to figure out if French food should even be in a buffet.  I have had it before at some other buffets around the country.  But this buffet lacks inspiration or passion.  The workers don't seem to care one damn bit.  I can see it on their faces with the exception of the omletette chef.  But come on, seriously an omletette with oil and no real butter in a French Res.  I think not.  How much is real butter when you are serving smoked salmon? This place need Ramsey or someone to come and kick it in the ass and get it going.  I would go one by one item by item on why they sucked so bad, but they all just tasted blah blah blah...  Boring.  Such a shame for such a neat looking buffet in a neat casino.  Carlos Sr. pretty much hates this buffet now. Next trip for the Buffet of Buffets.  This one will with out a doubt be skipped.  Period.  Harrahs weakest link, for central strip buffets.  Carlos Jr.",

We went to the buffet for lunch and it included a pretty good selection of items from grilled vegetables to fresh crepes to some other French-like items that I did not eat (because I was only eating vegetarian and seafood items at the time).  And, that's where things went wrong:  the seafood.  While things like the seafood stew were excellent, the mussels in garlic were extremely briny and tough.  Half of the time, I was tasting sand rather than mussel.  Other than that, I'd say the buffet is definitely worth it, especially since lunchtime is such a great deal (at least compared to the other pricier buffets).  I'd go here again although I'd like to try some of the others before going back.",

There was a 30 minute wait, but I didn't mind much as I had remembered to bring a book.  My overall impression of the buffet was that the selection was small to moderate, but the quality tended to be high - for a buffet.  My biggest criticism is that nothing I had was hot - only warm at best.  I had: *   Eggs Benedict.  Fair English muffin, good Canadian bacon; eggs properly cooked. *   Croissant.  Good for a buffet, but not nearly as good as at Bouchon. *   Lyonnaise potatoes.  Disappointing.  Bland; very little onion flavor. *   Country sausage.  In many ways, like the link sausage you can get at any pancake house - but done right.  Very good flavor and texture. *   Veal sausage and onions.  Smooth texture, mild flavor, executed nicely. *   Andouille grilled sausage.  Short, fat sausage in a chewy casing.  Strong grilled flavor, coarse, slightly sweet, slightly spicy. *   Smoked fish (unknown type): hard and chewy, with a strong, smoky flavor; not too salty. *   Pain au chocolat.  OK bun, but with very little chocolat.  Fair to good. *   Cinnamon bun.  Strong cinnamon flavor, not too sweet. *   Nondescript cookie.  Fair. *   Pastry.  A flat dense, cakey pastry with slivered almonds and white icing.  Inside, a layer of marzipan.  My overall impression: not bad for a buffet, but not worth the money.",

Since I ate here day and night, I will contrast between the two and tell you which one is a better time.  Day: In my opinion, eating at Le Village for breakfast is what you should be aiming for. They're breakfast crepes, and omelets are wonderfully scrumptious! I always choose to eat here in the morning because, 1) the line isn't long (probably a 30 minute wait), and 2) the atmosphere in here is great. Oh gosh, I just love their french toast with maple syrup! Yum. The waffles at this buffet are more soft and moist than all the others in Vegas. In addition, I believe Le Village Buffet serves the best creme brulee in the strip. When you eat it in the morning, it's just like heaven. What a perfect way to start the day!  Night: I am not such a big fan of this buffet at night. I'd rather go to Rio, Planet Hollywood or Caesar's Palace to eat. At this buffet, it lacks the savory the food needs, not to mention that there is not a lot of choices for food here. The way they makes their crepes at night is too...overwhelming. I remembered waiting 15 mins in the line and I got a gigantic stuffed crepe that didn't even taste good. I feel like I was eating a blob of dough with chocolate and over-sweeten fruits. That really ruined my appetite. I don't think I ever ate their crepes at night again after that. It;s nowhere near their morning crepes. I guess it all depends on the person who makes them  ***Note: Go here for the creme brulee! Always!",

I was thinking maybe they'll have something different, you know maybe some thing European. This is just like any other buffet in LV. It has it's meats, noodles and salads. Asian foods are there too so I was a little disappointed with that. All that wait for garbage.  The best thing they have there is the made to order Crepe station.   So you wait about an hour to get into this place, empty your wallet than go to the Crepe station where you'll have to wait...in line.  Great isn't it? Try something else.",

You have to wait in line so take that into account when you make plans to go. My bf and I got there at 9:15am and got seated exactly at 10am. The champagne brunch starts at 10, so we were totally fine with that.   At first, the service seemed to be a little off because they were so busy, but then we had this wonderful lady who was extremely attentive. I'm bummed I can't remember her name, but she was awesome. She actually just gave us a cold bottle of champagne, since we kept on getting refills, and she continued to refill our flutes after.   The food quality and selection was wonderful..they have fresh crepes, omelets, a sushi chef (basic stuff), crab legs (nom nom nom) and creme brulee (my favorite dessert) that they were actually caramelizing in from of you.  At about 30 bucks a person, it's well worth it. Just be prepared to wait.",

I also really liked the waffles and crepes, although the crepes could have benefited from a bit more fruit filling from the less than personable crepe maker. The meats were all pretty good (bacon, sausage, sirloin, pork loin) and I also liked the domas. Fruits, crab legs, eggs, hashbrowns, salads...quite a wide variety of things to pick from.  Not the very best of the Vegas buffets but certainly in the second tier.",

Their seafood area is awesome :D ... love love love.  Don't like the long lines however, if you start standing in line after 1:00 PM ... good luck ... haha ...

My friends were late so I bought myself an Eiffel Tower of Margarita just outside the buffet to enjoy while waiting.  That was the best part o the entire meal.  For only $14.99, you can get a solid brain freeze.   We had a larger party and apparently if you have more than 8 people in your party, they charge some insane amount of gratuity.  We were cheap so we split into two tables.  The crepes were decent and the prime rib was really yummy.  I had about 10 little creme brulee cups for dessert.  The highlight/lowlight of my evening was my war with the crab.  Yes, Mr. Crableg (who was already cooked) won the battle.  I tried to crack the shell open and instead I got a deep cut on my index finger. Even after applying pressure on the wound for about 10 minutes, it was still bleeding. The bandaid on my finger ruined my sexy outfit for the evening.  Maybe I'm deducting stars because I'm still bitter about Mr. Crableg.",

Some of the food was cold though (not supposed to be), so that turned me off a little bit. Prime rib was okay, more fat than meat, but nice flavor. The made to order crepe station was awesome. Lots of seafood, even though it was a lunch buffet. HUGE dessert selection.  Our service was fantastic, our waitress was always around to get us drink refills which was a big deal, as we were kind of dehydrated from the night before !

It's amazing for so many things to taste bad. I will tell you right now what's good: -fresh made omelette -fresh crepes- savory or sweet! they do run out of ingredients (mushrooms, spinach). I was only able to get ham and cheese :(  -prime rib- This will come out a little later around 10:30/11:00 am. If you come too early, it won't be available.  -quiche- part of breakfast and will be gone around 11.  -CREME BRULEEEEEEE :) My favorite part and my sisters all agreed it was delicious. Be careful because they have a caramel cream thing that looks exactly like it, but without the crystallized sugar on top. As far as comfort goes, the women's bathroom is a single bathroom stall for the whole buffet. It's incredible in a bad way.  The sushi rice was completely dry, it was disgusting. Crab legs were not very special either. The worker kind of burnt my crepe because his skillet was too hot. The service was subpar. When I came in, the lady at the front looked nice, but she was rude. I don't always buy groupons, but I did because we were coming for my sister's bachelorette party so I did. I had two groupon codes and i meant to use one for 4 people, and accidentally opened the one for 2 people. When she said for 2 people, I said no. Then she clicked the redeem voucher anyway. I made a mistake but she didn't even listen to my answer. So I ended up wasting the groupon for 1 person because I had 5 people instead of 6. I lost about $28.00. It wouldve been more okay if she didn't laugh at my helpless situation.The groupon really wasn't that worth it, so I would advise against it unless you go to dinner or breakfast and want two drinks. Each one came with two free beers/mimosas. But brunch price is $30.00 with bottomless mimosas. It's only a little more for all you can drink. The server at our table was also a little rude. I could tell she didn't really want to help us. I am very likely to not come back at my own achord",

It's $24 pp which I now think is ridiculous because they literally offer just about nothing for breakfast. There was no wow factor at all. The buffet consisted of your typical eggs and sausage, a crepe station, and some fruit. Two sides of the buffet were exactly the same thing too which made it even more limited on what you could eat. As for breakfast I really don't recommend coming to Paris. Go to the Ballegio where you can get a bang for your buck.",

    "text": "So bad. So, so bad.  Hungry for breakfast, my mom and I ventured over to Paris. My mission was to go to one of my favorite breakfast places, Mon Ami Gabi, but at the entrance to the restaurant, I mistakenly told my mom I'd heard Paris has a decent breakfast buffet. As an extreme lover of buffets, she had been convinced with just that one line and decided we must try it!  With conventions in town, the line was about 25 people deep but moved fairly quickly. Tables were pretty full so we were seated at the first table past the entrance. When we asked for better seating, the hostess told us our only other option was to sit in a private room area as the open tables closer to the buffet were reserved.   I've never been to a buffet where I struggled to find things to eat and still I walked away hungry. There are a few stations that can be summed up in three categories: bread, potato, and fake egg. I'm not a big bread fan so I skipped the toast, bagels, french bread, etc. There were plenty of potatoes: diced and sauteed, roasted fingerling, two things of shaved hash browns, and fried hash brown patties. Same situation with the eggs: scrambled, scrambled with things, scrambled with other things. There are two made-to-order stations: an omelette station and their famous crepe station. Otherwise, big bowls of yogurt, watery questionably fresh fruit, and store-brought danishes and other bread. Many of the items were low or close to empty as if they couldn't keep up with the volume, and when we arrived half the items didn't have labels.   Other than the gentleman at the crepe station, we didn't have any good service and everyone seemed slightly annoyed. I don't blame them at all-- this is an older staff and they were probably overwhelmed by the volume of patrons.   The other really disturbing thing here was the questionable cleanliness. There was a chef constantly wiping the stations with a rag and I witnessed food inadvertently wiped into the serving trays. My silverware was dirty and my mom noticed the pans and such were also grimy.   More painful than remembering you paid $22 + tax and tip to eat food of such quality is having to suppress the realization that Mon Ami Gabi is cheaper, much better quality, and just a few yards away.",

I ate here three times on my last Vegas trip. This is a good place to go and get two nice plates without totally stuffing yourself. Definitely a good deal considering the french theme and preparations. Very satisfying.   Each time I went the service was good - but especially at breakfast. I was happy to have an extra glass of orange juice without asking and a full pot of coffee during both my breakfast visits. This is a good place to have breakfast before hitting up the card tables and pretending to be one of the guys from Rounders.   *Please tip you crepe maker. You can get extra whip creme for the asking!*  Highly Recommended.",

    "text": "Now, I'm warning you now, this buffet is really meh to me. They have very little variety of food. The food they serve at this buffet is similar to things that the French would eat, just clearly not as good.   If I had to rate this place on the food alone (not including the sweets), I'd probably only give this place 2/5 stars.   Tbh, the main reason I like this place is because they have a crepe station and I absolutely love crepes. They have both sweet and savory crepes. (There is an option to tip the crepe maker. It is not required but I would recommend it considering he stands there making freshly made crepes for you lol). They have other amazing desserts but I didn't have any during my recent visit.   Another reason why I'm not giving this place more stars is because the staff is kind of meh. There was a long line to enter the buffet and one of the cashier's helped out these customers that just waltzed in saying they were waiting in line for a long time. Luckily, the 2nd cashier shut them down the second time they needed help saying we've been waiting a long time too. (We were and people kept tryna cut through the line lol). Also, the man in charge of drinks at our table didn't give me a refill until I was pretty much done eating.   Setting wise, the place was nice and clean. It isn't as nice as Caesars or Bellagio or anything but it is pretty nice and decently priced. The setting inside the buffet is like you're city around eating in the city of Paris. I definitely would recommend coming at least once to experience it. But this is not my personal Vegas buffet choice.",

The servers had cute little maid uniforms and hurried around with drinks and empty plates. It was cute. Even though the one helping me brought me Pepsi even though I asked for Sprite. Oh well.  If you have a sweet tooth, you'd love this place! I enjoyed the endless amount of delicious macaroons. The made to order crepe was cute but I have a crepe machine at home so I wasn't gagging for it.  *MUST READ TIP: So... they do not keep an eye on you as they're super busy. I had placed a tupper ware bowl in my bag and every time there weren't anybody near by, I'd empty out a tray of macaroons into the tupper ware. I think I was able to leave the place with 30-40 macaroons. And then, I packed about 5 to 10 into little pretty plastic bags I had brought from home, and wrapped them nicely. Went downstairs to the gift shop and asked for small shopping bags that says \"PARIS LAS VEGAS\" on it. That's how you save money by not buying souvenirs! I gave a bag to my in-laws, a couple to my co-workers and some to my kids' teacher. :D I think I saved at least $120 from it! Learn this tip, henny.",

The food is bland, poorly presented and the staff is sloppy. The tables were wobbly, the floor sticky and the food stations had food spilled out of their containers.  The price was as expected at any buffet but the cost is irrelevant because no matter the cost, food service should not be this poor. A lower cost would not make the experience any better.  There was a time when the Paris Buffet was good, that was a lifetime ago.  There are 100s of places in Vegas where you can get a far better meal for a fraction of the price.",

Seemed like an ongoing theme within customer service around Paris hotel.   When I was going to get my food, I noticed a young man asking for more mac & cheese and the chef straight up looked at him, turned his back and walked away. Felt bad for him.

    "text": "This is my first time here but considering the plethora of options of high end buffets in Vegas, I will not be back. It wasn't horrible but you can taste the haphazard lack of standards.  For instance, they for some reason decided to sprinkle salt straight onto the food post cooking. This meant crunching on a glob of salt that was beyond revolting. More than 1/2 of the food descriptions tags were blank so you often had to ask or guess. A good example of failure to care about details or standards is the frnch macaroons being assembled wrong but more on that later. The variety for a buffet at this level was lacking.  They had \"bouillabaisse\" with clams and crawfish, and mussels and next to it they had a dish of \"seafood bouillabaisse\"... A made to order crepe station had decent filling but the crepe itself was very soggy. This is due to cooking heat being too low or batter being too thick. THE PRIME RIB WAS HOWEVER ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. It was so tender that a knife was not really need.  As a French inspired buffet, you would expect amazing desserts.  The tiramisu in the chocolate cup was fantastic and almost made up for the lack of options (Except tiramisu is Italian and not French). The creme brulee flavor was ok and the little brulee they had was done well. The texture however indicated it over cooked. French macaroons were stale and tasted like hard cookies with nutella sandwiched and not the crunchy outer layer and chewy center. They even sandwiched it wrong. They stacked it and not put it together face to face. The food alone is enough to avoid this place but the service was also lackluster. That is saying something seeing as it is a buffet and the bar for service is already very low. When a first time customer is approached and asked what he wanted to drink, him asking what the options are does not warrant an eyeroll and a repeat in louder and slower voice. I speak English just fine thank you! And louder and slower wouldn't suddenly improve my vocubalary regardless. From that point on I did not see my server but other servers and the bussers who had tables in the viscinity stepped up and filled the void so service did not suffer TOO much.",

Brunch includes pretty much all of the dinner options plus more breakfast items (omlette and crepe stations) and unlimited champagne and mimosas (no extra charge) for Sunday brunch!  Really, the only thing it's missing is a little more ethnic food variety. I guess you get what you'd expect from a French-themed restaurant.   Regardless, this place just can't be beat.

    "text": "Came here for dinner with coworkers. Let me get to the pros and cons:  Pros:  Decent pricing for a buffet We got seated pretty fast even when the line was zig zagging out the door. THEY SERVE PRIME RIB? (it was good!) Amazing dessert choices  Cons: They do NOT take same day reservations. Their spinach dip is horrible The veggies in the salad bar might be frozen. Why? I think their fridge is either too cold or hey left the tray under the vent in the fridge. and... They dont have these amazing food where I live  Tips and tricks: Want ice cream but not in a cone or plate? They have bowls near the soup section. Avoid the fillers; rice, potato, pasta, or carbs in general. EAT THE EXPENSIVE STUFF.",

The only good thing about the place was our waitress, and our cold beer.  The food was less than average, the selection was minimal. But the reason for my one star is the following: At 1:00 p.m., which is about 90 minutes into lunch buffet, there were almost discarded trays of desserts from the breakfast buffet, with labels indicating completely different food items. Patrons were walking into food set-up areas to get desserts which were there waiting to be placed in windows for long long time. I would never condone such behavior, but I do understand why. We had to flag down a manager to show them.  I am not referring to one spot, or one tray. The whole area of desserts...   This is in the Paris Hotel, in Vegas. I had been there few years back, and it was phenomenal. What happened? I expect more, and by that I don't mean more food, but more organization, and just decent presentation of food.   Needless to say it was very disappointing, and I am embarrassed for them.",

Considering the price and the ridiculous wait time, food was below average to bad. I remember downing half a glass of water after eating a scoop of paella as it was beyond salty. The rest were the same or slightly worse than golden corral, with the only saving grace coming from the omelet and crepe stations. Someone here commented highly on their desert offerings but I personally could not tell the difference between the ones I saw and my local supermarket 's. They were no French, nor European, just mere cheap unimaginative sugar loaded selections for the undemanding holiday guests.. I ended up going to normal restaurants as Le Village gave me such a bad impression of Vegas buffets. Please stay away!!",

    "text": "Paris was once an amazing casino with an unbelievable buffet.  It has gone downhill over the past several years as Caesar's has decided to spend money elsewhere and neglect some of its (formerly exceptional) properties.  I used to rave about this buffet to friends, and ALWAYS brought friends to Le Village Buffet for breakfast.  Especially if they were first time visitors to Las Vegas.  It is fairly expensive but it used to be worth it.  Well it only took one final experience, no longer will I be taking people here.  EVER.    The food- the quality has gone way down hill.  There is no longer the extensive list of French foods in this once great buffet.  They have downgraded to just basic food, the omelets are bland, and there isn't the dessert selection that they used to have.  Read to the end to see the final straw- I don't want to gross people out.    The service- in my time with my friends the wait staff came around twice.  We were there for about an hour.    The Ambiance- still nice, looks like French villages and it is a pleasant dining atmosphere.    The final straw- please forgive me for grossing you out, but there were ants on my pastry.  Yes I did find a pastry that seemed palatable but there was an added protein element.  When I want protein, I will go to the meat sections, not the dessert section.    I will avoid this buffet at all costs.  I will not be back, and it is definitely not worth the price.",

Today, I met some friends from the East who I was taking hiking at Mount Charleston and we decided to have breakfast here.  It was a good choice.  We were there when it opened at 7 AM, and we were the first at the omelette/fresh egg station.  I got an omelette made with mushrooms, spinach, jalapenos, and cheese.  The omelette was quickly done by the cook and it was very good.  I also had a few slices of bacon.  It was not crisp nor limp but somewhere in between.  Now it was time for dessert.  I walked over to the crepe section.  I studied the list of crepes and decided on the second one, the crepe made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries.  The cook poured the batter, spread it around the griddle with his little crepe plow, evening out the batter so it was a thin pancake on the griddle.  He turned it and then filled it with the fruit listed above.  After folding it expertly, he topped it with some fresh whipped cream and then spread some raspberry coulis on the whipped cream.  The crepe was so hot, the whipped cream slid off as I walked back to the table.  I thoroughly enjoyed breakfast here.  Service was good and the individual stations had great choices.  I could go back again and have several completely different things.    This is a very strong breakfast buffet!",

There are other options to choose from and the Paris buffet was the most high end from the list (Rio, Harrah, Flamingos, etc) so I thought. It's the Monday after Christmas weekend therefore it's considered holiday pricing normally $30 vs $38. The one big mistake I forgot to do is make a reservation, they do it one day in advance. Instead we had to wait 1.5 hours 6pm on a Monday. The hostess was really nice and sat us in a quieter room away from the crowds. However, once you get in, I felt instantly overwhelmed by all the people rushing to get food. There were tons of large families. The restaurant did a good job cranking out food, stocking utensils, clearing tables, grabbing refills. They are certainly making their money, however it just felt very impersonal, rushed, etc. The staff definitely works hard but I felt they were way understaffed. I saw a waiter just give 2 of every drink to keep people occupied. $12 unlimited drink add on is worth it but I passed this time.   Now the food, one their website they are known for truffle mac and cheese, prime rib, and crab legs. Those were exactly the highlights of the meal. Everything else was very sub par. I actually like they had lots of vegetarian options but the taste was awful, under seasoned, seems they just boiled them. Not too much meat option they had pre cut rotisserie chicken and lamb leg. The seafood wasn't the best quality, yes there is shrimp and crab legs but they are skimpy. The sushi and soup station was messy and unappetizing. They had a large variety of bread and desserts. The one big plus is a custom crepe stand!   After my second plate, I was over navigating around the hoards of people filing up their plates to get their money's worth.   Also, for the whole restaurant there is only one stall per gender!",

The fruits and salads were fresh and the soup was so rich and creamy, they definitely pulled all the stops!

But as for the thing that matters, the food was pretty good. The omelette station, crepe station and others were pretty good. One disappointing thing is that I didn't see any cheeses and baguettes. I think they were out or something or we arrived a little late.  This was the best breakfast buffet of the ones we tried when it comes to food quality, but the wait and the service isn't.",

Good variety and they had the best prime rib hands down.  Melted in your mouth. I went to Bellagio buffet the next day and paid $36 and it wasn't as good. Their prime rib was tough.  The only complaint I had was that most of their dish descriptions didn't match what was being offered.  The service was fine and waitress refilled our drinks often.",

This is what they had during the Sunday Brunch:  -Snow Crabs- Soo fresh and sweet. make sure you get some butter -Dungenes Crab- Not as fresh as I would like them to be. I would pass on this one. -Made to order omelettes- I'm not usually an omelets person but I loved them here. -Ham and cheese croissants.- This one was sooo good. The croissant used in the ham and cheese croissant was much better than the plain ones they had sitting at the dessert bar. -Peel to ear shrimp- I remember them to be bigger. Still great though. -Prime Rib- It was ok. I expected to be a lot better. I wasn't there for the prime rib anyways. -French Onion Soup. -Fresh grilled veggies -Made to order crepes. I'm still salivating thinking about them. -Bouillabaisse very goood. There was a bunch of other stuff but that's what I ate.  Oh and dessert... -Creme brulee *Yum* -Flan (perfect consistency, doesn't have that yolk smell* -fruit tarts, cakes oh my..  The server was a bit slow but I think she had too many tables on her hands. Very sweet woman. My party and ate for two hours so we gave her a $15 tip for holding her table up.  This buffet is a must everytime I'm in Vegas",

For the price it was worth it, but go hungry in order to get your money's worth and be prepared to wait in line for a while. Also, make sure you take your ID if you want to use your room card for payment, the gate keeper would not allow me to use mine because it happened to be the one time I left the room without an ID. I can understand that I suppose and luckily we had cash otherwise we'd have been back at the end of the (long) queue!",

    "text": "It's a few days until my first wedding anniversary, so I thought the the most fitting place to take the prestigious spot of my 50th Review would be the place where we held our wedding dinner reception almost one year ago - Le Village Buffet in the Paris Hotel.   Ohhhh yeah. Mmmhhmmm. That's right, we did this buffet style!!! Best believe.    I'm pretty sure my husband was relieved to see that I did not morph into Bridezilla during the months leading up to our wedding day.  Truth be known, I'm pretty easy to please.  I didn't need the eleborate bells and whistles on my wedding day.  I wanted it to be fun, unpretentious and memorable. Plain and simple.    So what better way to please the 90 nearest and dearest friends and family members that made it out to Vegas than to treat them to a meal buffet-style after the ceremony in the Paris Hotel chapel.  It was only $25 a head and there were LOADS and LOADS of food options to choose from.  Forget about the glitz and glamour of a 3 course meal.  No worries on having to add Meat, Fish or Chicken check boxes on our RSVP cards.  I wanted my guests to feel like they could grub on their own terms.  And believe me - the hubby and I both come from families that take food SERIOUSLY.  Our families love food.  So the option of people heading for seconds (and thirds, fourths...) was a plus.  Being that it was the Paris hotel, the menu echoed of French dishes. The food was amazingly delicious for a buffet!   They were even able to provide us with a private section of the restaurant just for our party.  The decor was breathtaking - the ceilings were painted to look like a bright blue sky with puffs of white clouds.  The floors mimicked cobblestone sidewalks and the buffet stations were made to look like old French houses.   Each \"Station\" showcased food from the 6 different regions of France.They were also able to provide our awesome 3 tier wedding cake (vanilla cake with fresh berries) and champagne for the toast.    We received nothing but praises from our guests on how outstanding the food was.    I had to go to Vegas for business during the summer of '07 and I took my husband with me.  Where did we stop for our first meal? Uh huh, Le Village Buffet.  We heard so much about the awesome Breakfast/Brunch buffet that they had, we had to give it a go.  And it was sooooo worth it.  In fact, I'll be heading back to Vegas on business again in a couple of weeks, and the Le Village Buffet will definitely be on my itinerary.",

I've been here every time I came to Vegas except for last time which allows me to vote for this place as the best buffet in Vegas bc I went to Wicked Spoon and I was not impressed whatsoever. Food was just meh and at $45, I mean you've gotta have something that sets you apart. Nope! I'm coming back to Le Village once I finish my final exams next month yay. Top notch dishes: The salmon, truffle pasta and oh my goodness the olive salad. Absolutely love the dessert section. Like everyone says, the creme brulee is wonderful. My sister thinks the flan is even better but I'm a creme brulee fan. I've tried a few of the crepes and so far I realllyy liked the one I got with apples sauteed in brandy and candied walnuts. Yum. Cons: You will feel like a balloon when you leave. It's impossible to resist overeating here so come with an empty stomach. I usually stop eating the day before I plan to go here lol :D",

It is ironic to have to wait for 45 minutes to be seated (and be $24.95 + tax poorer), considering that I managed to get into The Bank the night before with no wait (and not have to be out of pocket).    In any case, the food never fails to disappoint.  I once watched a feature on TV (PS: the only thing that I watch is Food Network and Travel... and occassional bit of American Idol) on how they source the ingredients for buffet food.  While it was not able to gross me out and put me off buffet forever, it's enough to get me into thinking that the prime rib that they had served in Le Village Buffet is the one that is near or past the expiry date @ Les Artistes.  I could not help but be slightly perturbed.",

So we join the gang, and one hour later we were finally in the restaurant.  After eating at the Wicked Spoon a couple of days ago, I felt I wanted to leave this place right away. It feels like a school cafeteria. I honestly could not find anything appetizing in this place. The prime rib is served almost well down, and tough. The Orange duck is quite juicy but it's not better than any roast duck from Chinatown. The cut is very poorly done too.   I expected the desert to at least give me something to justify our 1-hour wait but again it's very disappointing. There is nothing that says \"French\". the creme bulee is alright but nothing more than what you can get from grocery store, frozen. There is not even a single piece of cake worth mentioning.   I don't mind spending the $19 for lunch but the hour wait is a total waste of time.  Skip this at all cost and go to Bellagio or Wicked Spoon.",

    "text": "After trying a couple of buffets in Vegas over various trips one of my friends had a coupon for here so we made a second round to what Paris's buffet had to offer during dinner.  I wasn't super impressed the first time however we did arrive during the transition between brunch and dinner so I figured maybe not as many options were available.  To my surprise I actually preferred brunch time since they had more dishes that catered to my personal tastes; eggs benidict and smoked salmon? That's pretty much all I need in my life with some good dessert haha.   Everything in general is just kind of 'meh' and didn't feel it's worth the money. One of my friends was actually really disappointed with the place and wish we would have went elsewhere for our buffet fix.  If you want some prime rib, turkey or stuffed lamb be prepared to wait in another pretty long line. The lamb was good but not that great. I can get soooooo much better lamb near where I live. My friends really enjoyed their prime rib but boyfriend said it wasn't the best he'd had either.  There's never really a line for any of the other sections of the buffet. Potatoes are whatever...but like I said most things served here is medicore with nothing particularly standing out. And to my disappointment the dessert here was lacking. Come on, the french revolutionized patisserie! I would have expected a lot better. Oh well.  Overall I'd say if you're gonna go to a buffet go big and go to Bacchanal if you're really into your seafood (they had the best/freshest options for that department in my opinion) or I really enjoyed Bellagios (my personal favorite) buffet which had the most options overall at only $30 a person.",

Everything was old and falling apart. Why would they keep this place running is beyond me. The bathroom had 1 stall. The tiles were falling off and duck type was used to hold it in place. Yes, duck tape ladies and gentlemen. The furniture was nasty, the food was nasty and the place was just unkept. Really a restaurant on the strip? Who is the general manger for this place? There are so many options. Don't go here.   Oh, the 1 extra star is for the French macaroons. They are actually chewy and had the right taste and texture. All other deserts aren't even made in house.",

Bachannal met their dinner quota at 2pmon this day and was sheer madness. Plus you have to pay $30 more on top of your buffet pass.  Honestly, if i could, i would've eaten $30 worth of pasta/ mac n cheese. Thats all i ate here.  Everything else was mediocre vegas buffet food.  The salad was drenched in dressing. The macaron was a fake macaron with chocolate gumball drop in the center.  Bellagio macarons are so much better.  The sweet mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, and mushrooms were delicious.   The service was terrible but understandable because of holiday madness.   Love the ambiance ... 2 stars for the ambiance, veggies, and mac n cheese.  Although, wicked spoons has the best mac n cheese and dessert selection thus far.",

    "text": "I came here on a whim when walking around Paris trying to find a decent place to eat. I only eat at buffets once in a long while, but we figured we'd probably end up spending the same amount ($25pp) at any of the other restaurants, so why not?  I really love how they went all out with the \"village\" theme. When you walk in, it really feels like you're strolling through a little village. There are signs, street lamps, little rooms, and buffet stations that look like little cottages. I'm always a sucker for any kind of themed restaurant, so I loved this.  We were quickly seated in one of the rooms and had our drink orders taken. Then we went out to explore the buffet. It looked like they just restocked everything, so I was pretty delighted. There was also a very large selection that seems to continue all throughout the room with separate stations for dessert and soup/salad. I got some broccoli, mushrooms, 3 different pastas, mussels, potatoes, fish, strips of steak, sushi, green beans, roast beef, sausage, cold crab legs, and cam chowder. To be honest, I didn't expect that to fill be up, but it did, so i went on to dessert and got two creme brulees, a couple cookies, and flan (I'm a slave to dessert).   Overall, this is definitely a great buffet. The selection is very diverse, the food is fresh, and the service is fast and friendly.",

    "text": "Wow!  The Le Village Buffet at the Paris Hotel and Casino is really bad.  There was a huge selection of foods, but the quality and appearance just made the whole experience not worth it.              Duck L'orange=dry and overly sweet      Standing rib roast=very dry no taste      Sauteed mushrooms=only used cheap button mushrooms, no taste,      over cooked      Sushi=why sushi?  Mushy rice, frozen fish.  Why sushi for a French themed buffet?      Brussel sprouts=over boiled, mushy, no taste  This is coming from someone who didn't have to wait in long lines, and who didn't pay the full price, as my smart, lovely wife purchased a groupon deal.  The deal also included a bottle of wine-more like grape juice.  There was no bright spot for the food.  The entire menu, and recipes need to be redone-soon!  As previous reviewers noted, service was slow.  I will give credit though, our server was really trying hard.  She brought out drinks as fast as her feet would allow, and she was very pleasant, polite, and professional considering the circumstances she works under.  The gentleman who seems to be the front of the house manager needs to get his act together.  Instead of scolding and criticizing your staff maybe you should help clear tables, or service your customers.  Le Village Buffet in the Paris Hotel and Casino should be avoided until there is a total revamp of; management, menu, recipes, and service.",

The Mac and cheese with truffles and peas was to die for and so were the scalloped potatoes.     Husband who eats meat wasn't as impressed, but really he can eat at any buffet and be happy.

The manager in charge didnt care that it was they who seated us so close, they insisted on delivering us a quote to charge us for the extra service. Even though there was literally kess than 20 people in the entire buffet. Not to forget that they didnt give us any drinks at all at that point.  To top it off the food is a rehash of all the same food they have at their other resorts but their venue is smaller makes this place a recipe for disaster.  Needless to say, we left without tipping or paying their gratuity fine.  Avoid this place if you like to be treated as a guest.",

Anyway, this place is French inspired so there is lamb, duck, cheese trays and whatnot. I tried the tri-tip and the lamb and they tasted exactly the same to me, it was weird. The selection to choose from was not large at all. I ordered a mimosa and the orange juice was bad, tasted very cheap. The only thing that was cool and good was the crepe station. There was a man making crepes with anything you wanted and they were really good to. That was the only reason why I gave two stars. Lines was long and slow.

There were a few okay things on the buffet, such as the roasted chicken and the mashed potatoes, but most things were pretty forgettable.  The buffet's hallmark is the crepe station.  I waited in line for nearly 20 minutes for a crepe because there was only one person working the station and she was allowing people to order 3, 4, and even 5 crepes at a time.  Aside from being tacky on the part of the customers, it really should against policy in the interest of moving the line.  When I finally had my chance, I ordered a crepe with chicken and cheese.  When I bit into it, I noticed the filling was just as cold as it was in the refrigerator.  After about 2 bites, I gave up, disappointed that I waited in line that long.  I suppose the sweet crepes are the better option there.",

Quite extensive and yummy food too.    Awesome.   Service.  Sucked.  Not even a single drink refill.  Plates would stack up as we sat there.  Not in the least bit impressed.  Good thing the food was so good I didn't care.  We were with a party of 8 so they tried to charge us up front an automatic 17% tip, I hate it when places do that.  Feel like it's an excuse for them to provide crappy service, which was indeed the case.  Price: $23.99 for a weekend brunch which I thought was ok.  You get $5 off with a rewards card.  Go and enjoy!!!!!",

    "text": "Our group of four decided to try the brunch buffet at the Paris since we heard it was unlimited champagne. It made the $25 price tag worth it to us just for that fact! We arrived around 11:30 pm on a Saturday morning, so while there was a line, it moved pretty quickly and we only waited for around 15 minutes. By the time we left around 1 pm, the line was much much longer. Service was the best I have ever received at a buffet - our waitress kept the champagne flowing and the orange juice glasses full.  Overall, I found the food very underwhelming, especially the pastries. I was expecting good pastries at the Paris buffet, but was disappointed with the pain au chocolat that my husband and I split. The eclair was better, but still not amazing. The hash browns were practically burnt and chilly by the time I got to them in line. The farfalle pasta with pesto was by far the best thing I ate at the buffet. One of our friends got the crab legs, but ended up not being able to eat them due to not being able to get a cracker for them. Also, I would have liked brie since there was baguette. If there was brie and I missed it, it was hidden.  I'm glad we tried this buffet and I really appreciated all the champagne, but there are better brunch or lunch options on the Strip.",

It seems like the trip may not be complete without stopping here for a buffet.  The place can be crowded and the wait can be long, especially for lunch and dinner. There are a variety of food you can devour here. They are not all French food, majority is really more American style buffet food.  Sometimes, the smoke from the casino can travel inside the restaurant. Just remember, you are in a casino, so that is not unusual. The staff are very friendly and they are very responsive.  We probably will come back here again whenever we are in Las Vegas. It is one of our go-to places since it opened and our trip to Las Vegas seems incomplete if we don't stop by at le Village Buffet.",

I didn't eat a lot of the stuff on my plate because it just wasn't good. The crepe bar was nice, but that's a given considering we're in \"Paris\". Very average buffet that I probably would not go to again.  However our server was extremely friendly and kind. +1 for that =) I didn't think it was worth the price for the dinner buffet.. I would think it's better for a lunch/brunch. It's probably worth a stop if you buy the Buffet of Buffets (~40 for 24 hour buffet pass at 7 buffets) which is what I did the next day.",

So to get a break from the crowd I walk down the strip to Paris and Planet Hollywood. Im not a buffet person at all. I'd rather go to a nice sit down restaurant. Mass produced food usually isnt as good. But on this trip it just didnt work out that way. So out of the three buffets I went to on my trip I enjoyed Paris the most by far. I liked Italian food there, along with the prime rib. I have to say pretty decent food for guy who doesn't like buffets.",

Had a great table under a \"tree.\"  As you may have noticed we're in town for a few nights and had been to the Bellagio a few nights ago but weren't too impressed with the food although the Bellagio service was great.  Tonight, the food at Le Village was great but the service was a little shabby.  Never mind, we were more interested in the food.  The prime rib was good but so were the grilled chicken and the bouillabaisse (who knew) as were many other things in between.  For dessert there were nice little cakes and sweets and, of course, the crepes.  I ordered the number 2 and asked the lady to put a little of the brandied apples in as well.  Then she drizzled some raspberry sauce on top and I added some chocolate.  Oh my, it was the biggest crepe I ever had but it was sooooo good - could not finish it though.  We had gone for Sunday brunch a while back and liked that too.  The best thing for this place is to get Bellagio to provide the service for the Le Village food.  That would be a 5-star Vegas buffet.",

To the left of the buffet, they have a special line where youp ay about $10 more and you get to skip right to the front of the line. Totally worth it. You also get some mimosas. The food is unique and full of the flavor. The layout is also adorable. The food is very french inspired. It is split up into the 5 French provinces I think. I recommend this buffet!

Well, I finally did and wish I didn't!  In fact, I wish I could put no stars because that's what this restaurant deserves!  I am definitely a foodie and when I get to enjoy good food, I am a happy person. This last trip to Vegas, I got to enjoy many great buffets - Wicked Spoon (lunch and dinner), Bachannal Buffet and the Buffet @ the Wynn.  Le Village's standard is worse than Hometown Buffet. Everything is laden with salt. Don't bother trying the seafood dishes either. Everything tasted frozen and old.  Even the breads were cold and stale. How can you mess that up? And as for presentation - it reminded me of the horrible buffet from the movie, \"Vegas Vacation\". Everything looked brown, saucy and yellow.  And to top of our visit, we were sat in the section with the worst waiter. An older gentlemen who said \"oh my god\" as he came to our table. When I asked him for an ice tea, after he forgot the first time, he scolded me and cut me off with \"okay, don't worry, i got it\". And then never bringing me my ice tea - EVER. He disappeared after that. He didn't even take away our dirty plates. I had to take my plates and my guests plates over to the bus boy station, myself.  TO SUM IT UP -- DON'T GO HERE! Everything from service to food deserves a big giant F!!!",

The dessert section/bar was extremely lacking..I was expecting more of a variety due to the \"French\" theme that they were going for here... the only thing that was actually good for desserts was the Creme Brulee (which was way too small)..the ice cream machine was broken, so that sucked.. The crepes were good, but I wished that they had more toppings &fruits to choose from to put into /on them.. =/  I know that they received several awards several years earlier, but it's funny how they haven't gotten any recently?? I wonder why?? Hmm...maybe cuz the service & the quality of food has gone downhill perhaps?? yupp.. that must be it.. I'm def. not gonna come back..I'd rather go to Bellagio / Rio's Buffet...WAY more worth it...",

We came here yesterday for Sunday brunch and loved it. The only negative thing that I will mention is the long line. We waited for about 30 minutes before getting to our table but it was so worth the wait. We will definitely visit this place again.",

They really didn't have anything good to eat.  The only place I thought would have been worth my money, was the crepe stand, but the crepes were soggy and moist by the time I got back to my eating area.   My favorite part of this buffet was the sauteed mushrooms and the onion soup.  Even the prime rib was over done and dry.   I was so desperate, I went to the pasta stand and asked them to just boil me pasta and I made my own onion, pasta soup.   I was sad when I left. THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE BACON!  Will not be back, I rather take my buffet experience elsewhere and pay more for quality food.",

    "text": "Best breakfast I had in Vegas! The decor is very cute, made to look like you're eating in a French village. Each station has the name of a neighborhood or village in France, but I think that's more for lunch/dinner than for breakfast.  The made-to-order crepe station is definitely the thing you have to get. There are 8 crepe options, but you could probably get a custom one if you want. When I went, there was only one guy making crepes, so I stood in line for a good 10 or 15 minutes. Still worth it.  Biscuits and gravy were also delicious, and the egg guy made my two eggs over medium perfectly. My husband said this buffet has the best smoked salmon he's ever eaten. Coffee was pretty decent, too.  Go here for breakfast and you can't go wrong. We came using the Buffet of Buffet passes--definitely worth it!",

    "text": "I'm a little bit crazy, in that I generally don't eat at buffets...unless I'm in Las Vegas. Yeah, I know. Weird.  ANYWAY, there always seemed to be a really long line for Le Village, so we avoided it in the past. However, I was recently in Vegas for a work event, and was gifted with Diamond status for the Harrah's \"family\" of hotels and casinos, so I was able to use my VIP status to bypass the line, go through the fancy area, and get seated right away. YAY!  The ambiance of the Le Village buffet gets 4 stars. They really try to make you feel like you're in a little courtyard somewhere in France, which is cool with me. Especially when I was coming down from a stressful weekend and just wanted to relax, eat, and drink. I didn't feel like I was in Vegas, which totally worked for me. Our server was really nice, and had iced teas and mimosas (YAY, mimosas!!) on the table right away, and our mimosa glasses really didn't ever get empty. I'm a big fan of free unlimited mimosas, so I was a pretty happy girl from that standpoint.  Now, the food. Honestly, from the ever-present line and a lot of the reviews, I was expecting to be wowed. And I really wasn't. I mean, the food was good, and this buffet is definitely better than some, but there wasn't anything terribly French. Or many things that I couldn't get at any other buffet, really. But there were some pretty good dishes that I did break my one plate rule for and went back for seconds: bacon and brie pasta, spicy mussels, garlic mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, lamb tips, shrimp (oh, shrimp. How I love you.), and the antipasti plate. The creme brulee for dessert was nice, but nothing to swoon over. The rest of the desserts didn't do it for me, which was probably good, after the second plate of the things I mentioned above!  The price was comparable to other Vegas buffets, and for the quality of the food, a better deal than at some of the other hotels. All in all, was it good? Yep. Was it my favorite Las Vegas buffet? Nope. Would I be back again? Yes, but I wouldn't wait for ages in a line. It's a solid option, though, and like I said...the ambiance is worth it, especially if you want to feel like you're not in Vegas for awhile.",

The pot was raised when I heard about the 24-hour all-you-can-eat deal, and then raised some more with rave reviews from friends and Yelp. In our little quartet, me agreeing to do the buffet deal would make two frequent guests friends happy, and my boyfriend full of food, so the expectations were positive, so I went all-in.  The result? The food was pretty good! And by my math, three meals came to ~$15 each, which is a steal for Vegas (you can't even get a drink at a club for that price). The veggies were fresh, the meat was surprisingly juicy, but the real star of the show was the crepe area. Oh boy, I threw in some poached pears and drizzled raspberry sauce on top - delightful.   I don't know how to end my poker analogy because if you know anything about poker you can tell I don't quite understand \"value\" even though I know it's important. So, I'll end with something like, it's no Big Slick, but it's like getting dealt a pair of 9s. Yeah, it could be better, but still pretty good. Eh?",

I went here on a game night when the Warriors were playing the Thunder in Game 7.

When we went there were only a couple people ahead of us paying for their dinner. After we paid we waited a few minutes to be seated by the hostess. Once we were seated we waited several minutes before being greeted by our waitress and asked what we'd like for our drinks.   The buffet was so small and they did double of some of the items so that made it even less of a variety. There was NOTHING there I actually liked. Everything in the Asian section was so old, the Steamed buns were as hard as a rock and all the lo Mein noodles were smooshy and stuck together.   The \"prime rib\" tasted like stew meat and wasn't juicy or red. When we were done eating we weren't satisfied at all, with anything. All of the desserts were a miss. Some of the macaroons were ok but I expected so so so much better.   I tried the crepe station where the first time I went there was no one there and I stood there for a minute thinking they might not be doing it today - I went off to get food elsewhere. I saw her there the next time I got up and asked for a banana Nutella crepe. She had already made a crepe before I got there and she just tossed it on the heat and splattered bananas in it. It was cold and the crepe was already getting stale. :(   We also didn't have any utensils or napkins on our table - my boyfriend got up and grabbed some off an unoccupied table and our table and chairs still had crumbs all over it that we wiped off on our own. Our cups were completely empty and we had to finally ask for a refill to actually get more. There were a lot of people here but still all of the food looked untouched.   We have had much better food and service at buffets for half the price of this one. Who cares about the beautiful decor inside. Just walk through the shops or something, the whole Paris hotel and casino is beautiful enough.",

Truffle mushroom crepe is so light and fluffy...words don't do it justice. Small desserts were just okay. Creme Brule was sadly disappointing.

We had such a difficult time getting more coffee, my wife took a carafe off a table where the folks had left (that was after waiting 15 minutes for someone to pick up our empty carafe).  They seemed to focused on clearing tables more than providing good service.  The slab bacon was all fat.  The crepe was ok - but was reheated in front of me instead of being made fresh.

The prime rib is always tender and I enjoy the variety of sides, including mashed potatoes, green beans, mushrooms, and these braised lentils that were really delicious! There is definitely plenty of vegetable offerings, which is scarce in other budgets. The soups -cream of leek and French onion were also very good. Saving room for the crepes is a must!! You can pick from mixed berries , strawberries, and Nutella and bananas. I got mixed berries with whipped cream, and it was the best crepe I've ever had in my life! The whipped cream was soooo good!!

The item I found that did outshine the others was the andouille sausage. Very juicy and full of flavor.  The rest of the food was subpar - sushi looked like it was rotting, the ice cream was just normal soft serve, and mostly everything else around looked like it was sitting there for a while.   If you're going to get a lot of food, this place does the trick, but not great quality.",

Went onto Groupon and got 2 dinner buffets with bottomless beer and wine for only $59.99tx considering we are in Vegas it's actually a good deal! The line to start off with a little bit however: was made up by the great service and the wide variety of foods from prime rib or roasted chicken to salmon or crab or just pasta. Not to mention all the delicious desserts and the great atmosphere hard to believe you're in a building yet when you're sitting down it looks like you're in the courtyard in Paris. The waitress was really on top of her game and make sure we never were thirsty and constantly replenished our drinks before we even had to ask which is very rare. Long story short if you're in the area and looking for a buffet it's worth a try!",

After 30 minutes in line, we paid $22 for the Buffet and $12 for AYCD (Mimosas/Bloody Mary's).  I ate 7 types of meat (Bacon, Turkey Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Smoke Bacon, Ham, Andouille, and Corned Beef), 4 types of Potatoes, (Regular Hash Browns, Triangle Hash Browns, Potato Lyonese, and Hash, and 3 types of eggs (poached, scramble, omelet).  I also enjoyed an asparagus, chicken, cheese and tomato crepe with a garlic cream sauce.   I love Buffets because you can make your own unique food.  I took one of their mini waffles and topped it with a poached egg, Hollandaise, and Corned Beef & Hash.    The service was slow on my mimosas, I only enjoyed 4 flute glasses worth.",

    "text": "This place used to be really good once, but when I returned again, I was very disappointed by the price and quality of the food. First off, for 4 people to eat I spent a little over $100. And let me tell you, it wasn't worth the money or the wait.  The food is such poor quality, and they cook way too much of it. Don't get me wrong, I know it's a Buffet, but if it's 12 pm and there's still a whole tub of bacon and waffles still sitting there from this morning, then something's wrong. And like i said, it's just way too much things they make, yet it's so tasteless and not the best quality.   The salmon lox tasted obviously like it's been frozen and defrosted. It didn't taste fresh. The cream cheese they used on the side wasn't even good too. It wouldn't go on the plate and it was stuck to the serving spoon. And something about the texture of it didn't seem right.   The croissants tasted obviously store bought. They were stale, not flaky, and chewy. Also not buttery, almost like eating regular chewy old bread.   The rice they had there was also undercooked. It was also a little watery and lacked flavor. Very disappointed by that.  The cheese and salami was pretty bad too. The salami tasted like the salami out of a lunchables pack and the cheese wasn't very good quality either and not fresh.  Although, the prime rib was actually pretty good. I didn't have a problem with it. Also since I saw them make it and how they make it, It was pretty nice.  But other than that it the good was disappointing. Sausages were flavorless and mashed potatoes were flavorless too. The country gravy was awful and just super chunky. And it didn't taste very good.  Overall my experience here was pretty bad. The service was pretty nice and the servers were friendly and helpful. But the food is just straight out pretty horrible. Would I come here again? Obviously not. If you're looking for a nice buffet in Vegas, this is obviously not your go to destination. There's much better out there in Vegas trust me.",

    "text": "The theme is meant to be French, but that would be a stretch. This is \"French\" food the way Panda Express is \"Chinese\" food or Taco Bell is \"Mexican\" food. That may be fine for some people, but I certainly didn't enjoy it. This is a very solid 2 stars. Mediocre at best, with a few highlights. Vegetables were often overcooked, lots of the food didn't have much flavor, and items were often mislabeled.  My husband and in-laws enjoyed it, and they ate a lot of the meat dishes. Then again, they were going for quantity and cost over quality. If you enjoy eating lots of food versus enjoying quality food, this is a good option because it's relatively cheap by Vegas buffets.  As a vegetarian, there are few options with protein (and I'd say vegans are screwed). There were a few semi-decent pasta options--two \"gourmet\" mac and cheese ones (and one Mediterranean one that tasted really funky), plenty of vegetables (many overcooked), and a salad bar. The mac and cheese with peas was one of the highlights, along with the mashed potatoes.  For meat eaters, there was plenty--crab legs, prime rib, mussels, chicken, pork, and more.  Dessert was pretty bad. They had \"macarons\" but they were a really chewy, flavorless merengue and the fillings weren't good. Tiramisu had no coffee flavor, cheesecake just had no flavor at all, and many others were tasteless or were just sweet. Most of the desserts were mislabeled, which made them even less enjoyable, since you might think you were eating one thing, only to find out it was something else (this happened multiple times--cannoli tarts were labeled lemon tarts, chocolate cake was labeled tiramisu, tiramisu [which came in a chocolate cup where all you could see in the cup was custard] was labeled as creme brulee). It was like the kitchen staff didn't know what the desserts were and made their best guess when putting them out.   Anyway, in case it's not obvious, I would not recommend this place. Pay extra and go to a better buffet (or just a nice restaurant), or pay less and enjoy a meal somewhere else.",

With plenty of options. The reason we chose this one is because of the crepes station, which was quite tasty.  It's a buffet, it is filled with buffet lovers and that kinda of food. The bacon was limp and not great. The pastries were good. I will say the sausage gravy was absolutely excellent.  There are a lot of options but the sausage gravy was the only thing that really stuck out to me. The coffee was meh, the service meh, and the food just a-ok. But there are options for everyone. This was good for a hangover, plenty of greasy options to soak it all up.  By far the highlight was a girl coming to the counter to pay \"Do you guys like have a big breakfast?\" Um. It's a buffet sweetheart, says that outside. It provided a good chuckle.",

Upon arriving Thanksgiving eveningThe manager came out extremely rude his name was Frank was very abrupt-  basically telling me I made up the whole story and there's no way that any of his employees would ever do that then asked me to pull up the email showing the canceled open table reservation which I did - He still would not admit to any wrong doing on the part of his staff and took a very pompous attitude with me -I would never recommend anyone to ever go to the Paris buffet this manager Frank was absolutely horrible and should not be working in the public sector",

I love the seating, it's very Disney-like, specifically Pirates of the Caribbean the restaurant. Wonderful service, they're very friendly, hard working and attentive.   I recommend seating in one of the little rooms, just ask your host if you can sit in one, they'll usually seat you unless it's completely full.   For breakfast: arrive early, I'm talking about 9-9:30am on a weekday, probably 8:30am on a weekend or a holiday. We arrived at 9:50 and got seated by 10:20 and the line just kept building up. The crepes are ok. They get ya by having them made in front of you but that's where it ends. The sausage selection on the other hand is game. They have at least 10 different sausages to choose from. Also you have to try the potatoes and corned beef. Their breakfast is really really good.   For dinner: arrive early, we came by at 6pm on a weekday and there was practically no line. The struggle was real. We were trying so hard not to over eat because everything was so good. I loved the seafood, pretty basic, and all the desserts. Also had an arnold palmer which was a really nice touch to our meal.   Overall a fantastic buffet. We had the 24 hour pass which was around $60 after tax... it basically gives you access to a few buffets and lets you use it up to five times in a 24 hour period. Since we were staying at Planet Hollywood we mostly just went to Spice Market and Le Village. Both are really great buffets and a more economical approach to dining in Las Vegas.",

I paid about $40? for brunch on a Sunday and when I walked in, I could already tell the selection was limited. I literally went through the entire buffet my first round & had gotten everything that looked appealing to me.  (Which wasn't much)  When it was time for my second round, I ended up just getting the same thing over again.  The food was not very appetizing at all--it was either really bland, cold or salty.  Nothing stood out & I was so sad that it was such a waste of money.  Never again.  The place itself needs to remodel... I mean, there are so many nicer buffets in Vegas now, they should try to keep up. Honestly, whenever I pass by this buffet I just wonder to myself, \"seriously?? A line for THIS mediocre buffet\" pfttt.  Throw more $$ down and go to Bacchanal buffet instead--well worth the money.",

This time - 2015 - we had more discernment for what we liked.   We weren't impressed by anything being served, we only liked our super nice waiter.   It didn't look horrible, or anything, just not as appealing as the other buffets we've been to. Of course, it's not a famous or especially big one. We hopped back to Planet Hollywood's Buffet with our Buffet of Buffets pass instead of completing a meal here.",

    "text": "Pretty terrible service, good atmosphere, okay food....pretty much sums it up!   We made a reservation and after checking in, we were sat down after about 10 minutes. They took our drink orders in line, so I figured when we sat down after getting food, we'd have the drinks waiting for us. That did not happen.  We went and got all our food and there were still no drinks. In fact, I finished my entire first round of food before even one person looked in our direction. I had to flag someone down to come and get our drinks. I'm not really sure why we ordered them in the beginning if nobody was going to bring them to us.  After that, she came back one time to offer refills. We didn't leave a tip.  The actual look of the entire place was really cute and it looked like a village. So that was probably my favorite part of the meal.  The actual food was okay. Since it was a brunch, it was a mixture of breakfast and lunch items including made to order crepes, waffles, eggs, bacon etc. Plus an assortment of fish, sushi, pasta, meats, etc.   They also had a pretty good dessert selection including French macaroons that were delicious.  I wouldn't avoid this buffet again, but because the service was so terrible I wouldn't make it a destination.",

The caprese crepe was horrible, but the strawberry and Nutella crepe was good and had a pretty presentation too.  A lot of things were not good or just ok, there are not enough items besides dessert and fruit that are good or excellent to make the cost or caloric intake worth it.

    "text": "First of all, if you have a smartphone, check in to Paris Casino on Foursquare because you'll get a $5 off voucher to the buffet.  Considering that the buffet is $19 per person, the discount is pretty substantial.   We went for lunch on a wednesday around 1, and there were no lines.  The cashier lady was nice enough to extend my one $5 off voucher to my boyfriend as well, so we really saved $10 in the end. :) :) :) I WAS SO HAPPY. We thought the buffet would be our splurge meal!   On to the food... THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD. I know you're only supposed to take a bite of everything the first time around, but I was too distracted by the roast duck. It had some sort of sweet fruit glaze on the outside; I took double helpings-- bad idea. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6993.jpg&s=03d5b6267e1f08f716b744851647855e35d6d9dbd6188120206a4e1d1acac307\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a>  The shellfish wasn't too great, and I'm a little sad I wasted precious stomach space on them. Focaccia roll? Nice and chewy. Roast mushrooms? Perfectly seasoned. Tri-tip? Nice and pink in the middle. Buffet food is typically pretty meh, but how can you miss out on a Vegas buffet? This was one of the better buffets I've been to during the last 10 years. $15 well spent.  Round 2: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6996.jpg&s=86b9fd5f34f496b64f78056f0341ca818e435063790ca96e4c92418918f42c0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a> More mushrooms! Caesar salad + plain romaine (pre-mixed salads are often so heavy on the dressing!), creamed spinach + artichoke (YUM), sole, marinated tomato and mozzarella balls.   My tips would be to go easy on the pasta, get the duck and roast beef, get veggies (minus the asparagus), and don't get shellfish.  The fish is alright, the mediterranean section's got great sauces (pesto aioli! :D), and SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!  Observe: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6994.jpg&s=a1eecbcc0e4a25bbcd6334d80ff6b7272b75a1a5e95dadefc947d1174b6f21a8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a>  And that's only one side of the dessert island!  I tried a little of several desserts... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6996.jpg&s=86b9fd5f34f496b64f78056f0341ca818e435063790ca96e4c92418918f42c0f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a>  Macarons. So Frenchy and so good! I also heard the creme brulee and custard were good, but I was SO full I couldn't even think about putting creamy, heavy food into my stomach. However, I did squeeze in a little bit of space for a childhood favorite.  The apple crumble was divine-- hello, childhood memories! Paired with a dollop of soft serve, it was fantabulous! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fi92.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fl18%2FAyJee%2FIMG_6998.jpg&s=7907ec51f61948242d90a35eefb5bbca4abcabfdbce659ca6d64a505d56d8334\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">i92.photobucket.com/albu...</a>  The bf and I were stuffed for the rest of the day; we made use of a groupon on our way home, but took home most of the food. I legitimately thought I was going to die of fullness. Standing up straight was definitely an issue, but boy am I glad I went to Le Village! I did a little research beforehand on best buffets on the Strip, but ended up choosing Village over Bellagio due to the reviews for the dessert bar. ;) Sweet tooth win.",

I couldn't find much that I wanted to eat- even the cheese selection was lacking. I sipped on some onion soup and ate a cold baguette and left disappointed.

I would say I enjoyed having champagne being brought to me for brunch but I can't justify the quality of food and its appeal. Visually speaking, it wasn't a lot. Everything is pretty standard fare for a non-$50 Vegas buffet.  The good is that there are macarons (which I adore!!!) and crepes!

I started with a penne pasta dish that was delicious because it had a spiciness to it, I also got the pork and apples which was also quite well made. The prime rib was really tender but a bit saltier than I would like. The roast beef was too tough to cut and to chew. I did get a pot pie that tasted pretty good as well. There were clams and crab legs and both were mediocre. The crepes are pretty amazing and the fruits within are fresh. I had a variety of other desserts like the lemon tarts, creme brulee, flan, cake pops, cheese cake etc. I liked the tart and the creme brulee the best the flan and cake pops were far too sweet. This is a good buffet compared to planet Hollywood, I think it was better, and almost comparable to Caesar's since it's not the extra $25. The wait staff was way more attentive than both Caesar and Planet Hollywood and asked us how we were throughout the dining experience. The decor was adorable as well.",

Creme brulee had a puddle of syrup on top, and probably holding a temperature of 101 degrees. There we're a lot of small individual pastries, however it was hard to tell what they were, no labels. I did taste something that was suppose to be tiramisu....I think. Soft were ice cream was decent, along with the cute lollypop macaroons. Not one of my Vegas favorites.",

THE HIT OR MISS: crepes. My husband was not impressed, but I loved two of the four I ordered (ok so we went bananas for the crepes). The crepe batter, sauces, and nuts/granola mixings were superb. How they are cooked though is chef dependent. We tried banana Nutella, 2 Berries, and apple cinnamon. The banana Nutella was decadent, and 1 of the berries were good. THE SO-SO: Dessert selection was non-existent at breakfast understandably. Bakery selection was limited to Danishes and croissants, too small for a French buffet in my opinion.",

I thought they had an eclectic mix as opposed to your typical buffet with pork belly, chicken caccitorie and beef bourgurgmon served in miniature iron skillets.  Bellagio's pastas are better, but Paris is a close second.  I dunno if I ran across a Vegas buffet that serves lamb, but Paris does.  I didn't really venture off to the salad bar because I opted for the spinach & artichoke as well as some of the steamed vegetables.  The desserts are pretty similar to Bellagio & Wynn, but hopefully you had enough of the main selection to not even think of heading in that direction.  pointers:  if you have a free Total Rewards card, that reduces the price and you can even reduce the fee even more by clicking into Paris Casino on Foursquare and get a $5.00 off voucher that you have show your phone at the Total Rewards booth in the casino.",

This most recent trip we came in at 8:45 p.m. and the line was short, but there were people waiting to be seated. From the time we purchased, until the time we were seated was 30 minutes! The place was not busy, so we ask what's going on, and they told us that they had some call outs. I totally understand.

I'd also throw in there that not everything out there is a homerun. It is a buffet so there are times when things sit there too long or have the occasional bad batch... just use common sense and don't eat those.  Good to take friends, dates, coworkers, and potentially customers.",

The breakfast food looked bland but it actually was flavored very well. My favorite lunch food was the prime rib. The desserts looked a little sloppy/crumbled but I ended up only having room for the custard which was good too. I didn't like the organization of the buffet line as the breakfast and lunch food were all mixed together and out of order but overall I enjoyed my experience and would probably return again.",

I ordered three drinks: AJ, Choc milk, Coffee and I received it all with the addition of water.  One of the first places I attacked was crepe area. Fortunately the line was short. People making the crepes looked miserable. Then again, some of them come across customers like this one lady that held up the line because she forced the lady to remake her crepe because she supposedly put the wrong topping on her crepe\". Everyone in line made sure that chick knew she was dumb. So after she got her crepe, the same lady made mine. I felt bad for how that lady was to her so I tipped her a dollar. She instantly put a smile on her face and I think she felt appreciated and treated me well also. This buffet had snow crabs and shrimp galore. It made me a happy gal as I love seafood! The rest is history, and I waddled my way out (not really, but you know that means I ate my money's worth). I was extremely satisfied with their buffet.",

    "text": "After the kids spent their 1o dollars at Circus Circus in order to win 2 pillows, 4 bouncy balls, and a light up toy, we met up with the rest of the family at the Paris Hotel for our New Year dinner.  Le Village Buffet, along with the buffet at the Bellagio, are two of my favorite buffets on the strip, although I haven't tried the one at Wynn's yet. The ambience here is wonderful and brings me memories of me and hubby sitting outside a cafe in the real Paris sucking on escargot. Well, just me with the escargot bit because hubby would never eat snails.  The snow crab legs and cocktail shrimps are always good here, and this time around they had Jonah crab claws. I was surprised to find out that Jonah crabs used to be considered a nuisance to New England lobstermen, as I found them sweet and delicious. There were delicious baked oysters too, but no raw ones.  The dessert section is wondeful. Their creme brulee is perfect, and they have a crepe bar where they will make your crepe to order. We always seem to end our dinner with soft serve.  They also have good flan, nice and light.   My mom was able to have her crab legs warmed up by the waiter, although I prefer my snow crab legs fresh and chilled as I find them juicier that way. The waiters, of course, bring you all the drinks you want.  Full review and more photos on my blog.",

In short, the pancakes, french toast, and english muffins under the eggs benedict were stiff, even after I watched the chefs put out a new bin. The crepes were also a real disappointment.  They were moist and chewy, almost underdone.  The fruit topping was more like pie filling.  For lunch, the lamb and prime rib were both below room temperature, though that happens at a lot of buffets since they skimp out by cutting the slices way thin.  Most of the other dishes were simply not worth remembering.  The one thing I did like about this place was that it was cheap, after getting a players club card and using the included coupon, it was 10 bucks per person.  But when the only saving grace to a place is the price, especially in a place like Vegas, it's a little more than disappointing.",

The line to get in was long, but it was worth the wait! My only complaint was they only gave out 1 copy of the receipt, which had to be given to the hostess, and then returned to you when seated. The hostess would take multiple receipts at once, but apparently did not keep track of which belonged to who...so even though I paid with a credit card, I ended up with another party's paid-in-cash receipt.

One of the nicest of the buffets I've been to in Las Vegas (and I've been going almost every year since I was 3 years old). That explains the third star.  The fourth star is because of the kindness and customer service we received. My mother is somewhat of a kleptomaniac, except she asks before she takes. She was enamored with the coffee cups that the buffet had. They were very cute. She asked the waitress if she could buy them or take them, etc, and the waitress said, \"One moment , let me check\". Usually, when my mom does this, we are given rude responses. When the waitress returned, she gave my mother a set of 6 coffee cups for free. We left her a great tip, and my mom was very happy.  This was around 2003 or so, and we still have the coffee cups. I wish I could say more about the food, but it's a buffet, that's about all I can say.",

    "text": "Probably the best buffet I've ever been to - all for only $25.  All you can eat shrimp, crab, scallops, steak, chicken, salad, a huge assortment of breads and cheese (very a la the Paris theme), even escar go (if that's your thing...me...not so much) and finally crepes (which are made to order with fresh fruit and nutella). Follow this up with an entire center island dedicated just to dessert. It's a definite not-to-be-missed buffet.  On a side note - do all the HOT men stay at this hotel in Vegas? Honestly! Wow! Eating divine food and staring at divinely delicious men is definitely the icing on top.",

    "text": "After deciding that the World Carnival Buffet has lost it's touch and food quality, I decided that Le Village Buffet should be good! After all, the French are masters in the kitchen, right? $24.99? That's a deal!  What I really liked about this buffet is that they have many types of foods based on the different regions of France. For instance, you can get some food items originating from Burgundy or Alsace. However, I was confused when I found a buffet table that had hummus, sushi and sweet potatoes next to each other. I hope they have changed the way they organize their food station and remember that they are making French food. On another note, the stuffed baked tomatoes were good and I fairly much enjoyed their pasta dishes and crab legs. The ham and the meat station, for you carnivores out there, is a must! The meat is tender, juicy and flavorful. They do have a small section of salad and fruit.   The crepes to order were okay, I was not very impressed at the selection of toppings and I ended up decorating my plate, my mother's plate and another guest's plate when they saw me making the crepe look somewhat presentable. The batter seemed too thin and so the crepe was more like a pizzelle cookie at the end, except semi-soft.   They do have a desert station that you can go and browse around, but I recommend staying away from the creme caramel or flan. Definitely needs some flavor improvement there. I heard the creme brulee was pretty good though.   I loved the environment of this place! Friendly service and lively people. Nice place to come and eat before hitting the strip at night and they are a part of the  \"Buffet of Buffets\" 24 hour deal!",

    "text": "Ugh.  The cost is high, the line is long, the crepes were underdone and borderline disgusting.  It is dark and dreary inside, the wait staff have too many tables to attend to well at a time and everything appeared to either come out of a bag or be microwaved, with the exception of the crepes - which are prepared in front of you with ingredients that were pre-cooked long ago.  Pass on this one, go to the Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan.",

We had passed by it numerous times before trying it and there was always a line and a wait, but for this breakfast, a Monday morning, the wait was only about 10 minutes. I totally liked the atmosphere, it felt like you were actually in Paris and the food was very, very good.  Plenty of items to choose from and the cook-to-order omelet was outstanding.  I would recommend this breakfast buffet to anyone.",

Sometimes I walk around looking at the food, searching for something to get.  Most buffets that I like don't have me walking around looknig so much, I usually just want to grab everything and go... but this place didn't have that.    So as per the reviews below, the interior design and the setup is really cool, but for me the food quantity is lacking a bit.  I actually prefer the MGM buffet to this one, but many will not agree with me.     Derek",

    "text": "Beware on the Endless Beer/Wine deal for $11.99!!  I was there over Saturday evening and bought this special. They never told me at the cashier that their draft beer dispenser was broken. The reason I bought this special because because of the Blue Moon beer but was stuck to order only wine instead. I spoke with the manager and asked why they didn't have a back-up plan when this should happen again. He just smiled and walked away. I was amazed that such a big hotel like Paris didn't have a better courtesy/service. No offer for bottled beer nor refund was given at all.  So better to ask first when paying if the beer dispenser is working if you are a beer drinker.",

Every time we've come in the past they lied and said they didn't have it!! - the grilled veggies hidden in the back - two words: meat plate - vol au vent anything, especially when made to order - cheese assortment in the salad bar - picking the perfectly browned creme brulee - huge hulking lemon macarons  Cons:  - their little pink macarons are hard, and have a jelly filling instead of a creme one - every time I get their pasta I wonder why I even bothered. - everything starts tasting the same after a while, yet I keep coming back for more. - there's only one stall in the women's restroom. in a buffet? are you kidding? some lady almost followed me in!

    "text": "There's an abundance of chinese buffets in the Bay Area and they all offer mainly the same dishes.  Granted, the quality may differ, but in most cases, there's not much difference.  I went to the Buffet at the Wynn last year and was overwhelmed by the choices available and the quality of the food so a Las Vegas buffet was on the list for this year's trip.  Upon arrival in Sin City, our first meal was at Le Village Buffet in Paris.  It's been years since I've been here and I couldn't see what was offered during the 30 minute wait in line.  I was a bit PO'd about being seated at the far end of the room, until I took a peek at the grilling station right in front of us.  New York Steaks! Hot off the grill and incredibly moist. Just the steak here would've been worth the price of admission, but a quick trip around the buffet area and I found an abundance of crab legs (and not the skinny ones at the chines buffets), bbq ribs, fried chicken.  It's been years since I've been in Tokyo and had a freshly made crepe so I made a beeline for the crepe station where there was an abundance of choices for a fruit and dessert crepes.  If a banana and nutella crepe isn't to your liking, there's a huge dessert stand in the center of the buffet.  While you have most of the standard fare like cheesecake and apple pie, you've got to make sure you grab a freshly baked cup (or two) of creme brulee!  This was our one and only buffet stop during this trip because that was enough meat and seafood gluttony for the week!",
