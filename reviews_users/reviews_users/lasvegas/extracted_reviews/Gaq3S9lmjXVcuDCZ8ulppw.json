I am pretty much obsessed with some of their rolls, my favorites are Full Moon, Lava Flow, Nyi, Red Rock, and Treasure, but I honestly haven't tried anything I don't like. The nigiri it's always delicious, and I also definitely recommend the Vanilla Berry Parfait for dessert. I am disappointed that they stopped carrying \"white tuna\" aka Escolar, but that seems to be city-wide. The private rooms are great for larger groups, I'd suggest making a reservation ahead of time for those. They have plenty of beer, wine, and sake, and the best part is that Oyshi is open until 3am! Best AYCE sushi in Vegas!",

The sushi is delicious but this visit the counter was filthy.  They soy sauce was stuck to the counter and messy and you could see the glass rings and food from people who had eaten previously.  The restrooms were so gross.  They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a few weeks.  It's the first time I've ever been nervous eating my meal.  Cleanliness and sanitation is the utmost importance in restaurants especially sushi ones.  I hope if we come back that these issues are rectified.",

We all had AYCE.  Food came out faster than I expected, and not all at once. Service here gets an A+.   For  AYCE, sushi is very much up to par. It's not the best, but you definitely appreciate the taste. The best rolls were: Lobster flare, tiger roll, spider roll, and monster roll. Uni is good but you can only get 1 order.  Also, we saw that they ran out of ingredients or particular sushi (it's never fun to pay for AYCE only to find out the items you want had run out).   Still - great place.

Firstly, it wasn't busy at all, I have issues from the military and a long career working with criminals so I asked for a corner with a wall to my back. She immediately said \"can I put you at the table in the middle\".........wow!!!!!!!! Pull the sushi out of your ears and think about what I asked for. Then she proceeded to tell me once I was seated \"it's ok THIs TIME since we aren't that busy, normally it wouldn't be\"-  I told her frankly- \"well I'm a veteran with PTSD so thank you for the exception\"........ Waiter was great again btw!!!   I asked him if she was always that angry after she came in between me finishing my first round and waiting for round 2---- she asks \"are you ok? You don't have food\"........... now, I can see you might say she was just checking- but the way she did it, body language, tone of voice and previous interaction made me feel like I either had to have a constant stream of food coming, eating or I had to get out-   VERY UNENJOYABLE thanks to this lady!!!!!!

I completely changed my mind about this place.  My family and I had shrimp tempura, baked mussels, heart attack roll, salmon roll, california roll, oyshi roll, lasagna roll, yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, white tuna nigiri, and the vegas roll. Everything that we ordered was completely delicious. I really appreciated that the sashimi slices for their nigiri were generously thick. The fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was perfect. Not too much rice.  Only reason why I gave it a 4 is because the service was kind of eh. And I really didn't like how my 3-year-old was $16 for AYCE. My daughter doesn't even eat much sushi at all. I like sushi places that have children 5 & under free. So those two would be my only reasons as to why they don't receive 5 stars.   Minus the cons, I think this place is a very decent place to eat sushi. I would go back. Not often, but if I'm ever in this side of town & craving some sushi.. I'll definitely stop by.",

After 30 minutes, I asked how is it possible that everyone was seated before me?  The hosted blamed the manager who took my name, but never added me to the wait list.

I am very decisive, a trait I value in myself. I look around for the waiter who, just a minute prior, had served my friend and me some water.   5 minutes go by. Then 10. 15. Hello?  My friend goes in search of a waiter. He says he'll be over in a moment.  Okay. He finally comes over and takes my order. It's seriously another 15 or 20 minutes for some beef teryaki to be done AND it wasn't even that good. The meat was tough and not very flavorful. I dunno if it was on purpose or not, but whoever brought us our food didn't bring the check with it. Perhaps it was a mistake on their part or perhaps they brought it over as a silent apology for the terrible service. We just walked out before they could say anything. Does that make me a terrible person? It was 45 minutes for a to go order! I wish i was decisive about leaving and going somewhere else. I know I will never decide to go there again.",

The restaurant is charming and the staff are attentive. Pricing here us pretty standard so no suprises there. You can easily go here on a date or with your family. This place is my number one on my list of sushi restaurants.",

The waiting area starts to get packed in and this girl is flipping her pen with a dumbfounded look on her face just staring at the crowd of 17 in the waiting area. Yes I counted lol...that is when I talked to the manager, told her what was going on...told her I love this place, I come here all the time...BUT I WILL NO LONGER BE RETURNING. At which point I took my family and left. Good bye OYSHI!!! I do realize there is a rotation to be fair to the servers but that should not matter when the place is busy. But I am pretty sure I may get an excuse as a rsponse. All my family and friends come here because of my recommendation...I will be sure to have them avoid OYSHI.",

We were seated in the private room that has a big flat screen tv with sofa seating. I suggest reserving this room for a special occasion or if you have a large party.   We all had the all-you-can-eat sushi and for $26 it's a steal! There are a few catches though..only a 4 oyster limit per person and you have to eat the rice that comes with your sushi or they threaten to charge you for it .   I think we ordered everything on the menu but a few dishes that stood out were: rib eye steak teriyaki (not over cooked at all), calamari (I didn't get a chance to try this but other people at our table kept ordering more of this) J&B roll (soooo good with the baked scallops on top). I thought the baked rolls were a lot larger than the other sushi rolls so be careful not to order too much (like we did).   Our waiter was pretty attentive and even offered to take our picture for us. The owner was really nice. I think I talked to him about making the reservations and when he heard it was for a b-day he gave us the private room even though our party wasn't that big.  I'll definitely be coming back here the next time I'm Vegas.",

The wait time ironically can be slower when they are not busy than when they are busy (maybe they feel the urgency when they are packed).

Everything tasted fresh and they had some good flavors as well.  If you like sushi, you should give this place a try, it is better than anything else that I tried in Vegas while living there.",

They were great when they first open, now they are slow with everything. It takes at least 20 mins. to get your food. You'll even have to wait for a waiter to come around again just to pay your bill. Definitely give them a try but don't expect anything fast!",

    "text": "This place has gone downhill in a major way. It used to be good. I wonder if it's under new management or ownership.  The salmon nigiri was fresh, but everything else was just downright nasty. How do you mess up rolls that contain imitation crab? Which, by the way, a majority of the rolls contain. The imitation crab was mushy and sweet. The rolls were 7 day-old grocery store quality. I'm talking about Albertson's quality. The rolls at Whole Foods are way better than Oyshi's. Also, the rolls were loaded with way too much rice. I know that ayce places love to fill you up with rice, but this was ridiculous. Why have rolls called the yum yum scallop that contains one tiny sliver of scallop, or a lobster fair roll that has no lobster in it?  This was a waste of $72 for two people.",

    "text": "We've had lunch here for the second time in the last few weeks and it's True the place is rock solid as far as I can tell by our last two visits. I waited to post a review after our second visit because often the first time may not be enough of an experience to grade a restaurant properly. Excellent quality all around, good atmosphere and most importantly the food is prepared consistently which is the main flaw with most restaurants, not just sushi places. Service is very good and everyone seems to help each other deliver orders to the tables. We really like the fact that the fish inside the rolls are actually cool in temperature and not warm like most places we've tried. The sauces are light in flavor and not over powering, which can overwhelm and kill the fish flavor of good quality sushi rolls. My only negative remark would be that for some reason, after our initial order the second order (often our final order) which is probably 1 or 2 rolls it seems to take a while to come out. Also today my wife wore white pants and it seems there was some soy sauce spilled on the seat of the booth and it stained her pants which I noticed when we went shopping afterwards, but no big deal since it would be hard to see that soy sauce was spilled on a black booth cushion. \"We ain't mad at ya\", we will be back for more. We hardly tried the extensive offerings this menu features. The best All You Can Eat sushi in town!",

Service was decent, not the quickest or most personable plus I had to ask for the check and plates stayed around longer than I would have preferred. One thing is for sure for me, great food outweighs decent service so we will be back soon, especially since it's 2 miles from my house.",

The problem with AYCE spots is I often feel the cut and quality of the fish is usually subpar and or drenched in sauces. Or just beefed up versions of shrimp tempura rolls.   Unfortunately this place was just that. Two stars for subpar sushi. I do think they deserve an additional star for the amount of appetites they offer as part of the AYCE deal. It's fair pricing if you can house some sushi but if you're not someone with a hug appetite I think the cost is a bit overpriced for the quality of fish.",

My typical order: mussels, potato croquettes, vegetable tempura, oysters, sea urchin (uni), masago, the heart attack roll & creme brulee.  Yes, I come to eat! My boyfriend usually gets down on at least 4 rolls plus AYCE appetizers which tally up to far more than $28. Usually hear hip-hop playing, which I like, so if you don't like the combo of AYCE & hip-hop, stay home.  [no one wants to hear you whine about the music selection] Just know you're missing out.

It gives people a chance to ease into sushi places if it's not their favorite thing to eat.  Two items that I highly recommend are Lobster fair and Love affair. Just so darn yummy. lobster fair is a California roll with baked lobster yumminess on top. Love affair is a STR with baked crab meat yumminess on top. Both just melt in your mouth.  Also love the different desserts they have. Anything from green tea ice cream to mochi to cream brulee. Again, so many different options.  Service is not the fastest so be patient.

I did not really understand this AYCE culture, in Europe we had carousel sushi and sashimi and we had eat in Tepenyaki/ Sushi restaurants (I think in USA the equivalent would be a high class of that old restaurant Benihana?). So I was DYING for sushi but know I really crave the wasabi (it clears me out and my sinuses are awful living here in the Anus Mundi).   I walked in and my waitress, whose name escapes me and I am so sorry as she was super sweet to me, I hope management can answer with her name, well she and a guy named Stefan were literally really interested in helping me indulge. Of course I could not get the AYCE (and with all that rice I would find it pretty disgusting even not on a diet-and honestly watching some people in America eat actually scares me)-but suffice to say I had hot sake (oddly no sugar and almost no carbs-1.4carbs per serving and NO sugars due to how it is fermented and I love it) so I indulged in both of my desires, luckily Sake does not really affect me for some reason, a glass of wine would make me drunk and red in the face but sake does very little I just love the taste.  I was eating sashimi made by Mexicans and a Filipino--being waited on by a Bulgarian and a girl who had Asian and Mexican in her (the waitress whose name escapes me) and I was all by myself just eating and I swear I gave most Americans a run for their money with the way I ate. It was the best \"splurge\" (food and money) I made in a long time. I really loved this place and any review that says the waitstaff are not attentive, well maybe you are not receptive as when you are open and you let people know what you want, you generally get what you want and the service here was superb.",

I was seated with my back turned from the bar and my wife sitting across from me with full view of the sushi bar.  During the middle of my dinner I decided to sit next to my wife. A couple of tables just left and two workers there started to clean table picking up dirty glasses and dishes and used napkins. They finished and walked back to the sushi bar by the kitchen entrance. To my shock they are the same people bringing my food. I almost wanted to puke!!! They did not once wash their hands. I didnt even see them use a towel to wipe their hands ( even if they did wipe it's still not ok). Management should never allow people bussing tables serve food!!",

I'm from Los Angeles and we have AYCE here so I couldn't imagine what the big deal was.  Well first off the price was incredible, it's a steal for what you get. There were 3 of us and we let my friend do all the ordering because she frequents here all the time. Of my memory serves me correctly we started with a Poke salad followed by 9 different sushi choices and ended with dessert. I couldn't tell you everything we ordered but the Japanese Lasagna sticks out, never had anything like it and it was so good. I don't know any place in Los Angeles that has anything close to it.  My friend is very outgoing and the waiter was great. He definitely earned his tip as often as she was calling him back for more about every 10-15 minutes.  The food here is fresh and packed full of flavor. I can't wait to come back to Vegas JUST for the sushi here. I wish your establishment much success and I will definitely be back",

We decided to go last night and the fish was NOT fresh at all . The Uni being the worst - was very brown and I had to send it back . The waitress even made a comment about it.... The tuna and salmon on our rolls were off colored - not the normal vibrant red and orange fresh versions should be.   The nigiri pieces came out better - super white tuna was the best, salmon belly, and garlic tuna.  Yellowtail was off perhaps I should've asked for a different cut . Oh and they put double rice to fish ratio which is annoying and takes away from the enjoyment of the fish   All in all I was very disappointed in Oyshi's decline in quality and I won't be returning . The server was very attentive and quick . She's the reason for extra star .   LESSON: walk up to the bar and check fish quality/freshness before committing to ayce or even eating there at all !",

A friend recently told us there was an Oyshi off of Rainbow Blvd just 15 minutes from our house so we knew we had to go ASAP. When we walked in there was a line at the host stand and the hostess had all of us sat within 5 minutes. We chose to sit at the bar and do AYCE. Our server was Mono and he was the BEST service we've ever had at an Oyshi restaurant! I cannot speak highly enough of his attention to detail. Thank you Mono! We will be back to this location and request you if you're working.",

As soon as we sat down a gentleman took our drink order and first round of food since we decided to all you can eat, we started receiving our food from the bar but with no server in sight, with at least 10-12 servers/bussers walking around, about 20 minutes go by and my husband still hasn't gotten a refill and we still had a stack of used plates in front of us, finally I went up and talked to the host because we still haven't received refills or even taken any more orders, so we decided we just wanted the check even though we were still hungry  The host was extremely nice and I told her what had happened and she explained our first server was leaving and a lady was supposed to come help but she never did and she apologized and went and got the manager, she as well was very nice and asked if she could do anything but at this point we were so frustrated we just asked for the check and she kindly said no, and so we left... honestly this was one of my favorite places to go but after ruining our Valentine's Day like this we won't be back and that saddens me because of one person who neglected to even check on us or even introduce herself but then again we never even saw the first server again either or was told he was leaving so bad on the service area, but I do appreciate both the host and managers concern",

    "text": "We made reservations for a party of 15 we didn't have to wait.  That part was great, as far as ordering and getting the food timely and accurately that is a different story.  I think it was because we had too many orders or something.  We had a group of people that loved to eat.  We order things that went to the table next to us they were a big party as well.  I heard our our screaming went to them because they didn't know what was ordered and they said okay we'll take it.  The food was okay not as good as I remember and I like another place that we go to better. . After to night experience it confirms that I wouldn't go there.   The following I found 1 star: Oysters (they taste really bad not fresh' and needed lemon) Adegashi tofu (they give you one and it is now sweet or yummy.   The decent but small pieces: Fresh scallop Eel Fried scallops  the fried scallops was small size but tasted yummy.  Why not isn't everything fried best?  The rib eye steak was ok but some of it was just too well done so it was tough.   The surf and turf is better with the rib eye and two shrimps. It comes in a sizzling platter,  Poke was like two little bites.  Photos of this was way generous then   The favs for the night: Garlic tuna Albacore Salmon belly Octopus Uni was low grade Sweet shrimp eh. We got a bunch of other rolls but really it is the atmosphere here that attract people imo. The nigiri sushi was the best.   The ice cream was out of mochi, the cream brulee was in a small little ramekin.  They only allow one dessert order why is that so small?  The parfait on the other hand is like a shake glass and large.",

I work in the restaurant industry and get it that on slower nights you might close early. But when there's a line out the door of people you are turning away, doesn't seem smart for business or for customer satisfaction. I would NEVER go to a restaurant 5 minutes or even an hour before close, but closing 2 hours early? Really??   Food is great tho. Just go in 4+ hours before close to ensure you can be seated.",

    "text": "If it was possible to give no stars, Oyshi would be the one. I thought I would give this place a second try being it has a few years since I first went. The host quoted a 30 minute wait, but we got sat at a table pretty quickly. I had asked our server, Ploi, if they do half rolls and she did say that I would either have be at the bar or eating AYCE, which I did mention my girlfriend and myself were both doing AYCE and I also let her know my girlfriend is allergic to avocado. Our first order consisted of a few appetizers but the wait was ridiculous, 15 minutes had passed and nothing came by while this was happening a party of 4 was just sat next to us and they got their food in less than 5 minutes. Ploi walked by and asked if we wanted to order any more I was getting impatient so I decided to order some rolls and asked if I can get half rolls, she mentioned that I would have be sat at the bar and have AYCE which disregarded the statement she made when I first asked about half rolls. Which is stupid why only have half rolls at the bar. Anyways I put in my orders and those came out pretty quick they messed up a couple of the salmon nigiri I had ordered 3 orders but they only gave us 2. After about 40 minutes our appetizers finally came but we ordered 3 orders of shrimp tempura and they only gave us 1 order and we noticed that the kitchen was coming out with plate fulls of shrimp tempura to every other table besides ours, we had to keep reminding our food runners that we ordered more than what we received. Another thing noted was a food runner gave us a rainbow roll that we did not order which had avocado, and my girlfriend is highly allergic to avocado so I dont know why they didn't make sure it was going to the right table. More time passed we made a few more orders of rolls and appetizers but those took another 30 minutes and the tables next to us keep getting their food right away. I'm sorry but perception wise that's not okay. I was still hungry but I did not want to wait another 30 minutes for my orders to come. I will not be returning to Oyshi. I've been to sushi places with very how volume in chinatown; they were more efficient running food and their servers have a better sense of urgency. I will not be returning to Oyshi.",

The quality of the sushi was just fine. Again it's not Nobu, but it really is a good value and just tasty. I had mostly nigiri (sushi).  - albacore (regular, seared and Cajun) - yellowtail - peppered with yuzu sauce - roll forget the name, had tuna on the inside and albacore on top.  - dynamite appetizer  I enjoyed everything I ordered.

Biggest concern was the cleanliness ! Lots of dust in the ceiling area and food on the floor ! The ceilings are black and you could see layers of dust plus the curtain at the front is super dirty and looks horrible ! I would recommend cleaning and looking at brightening the place up a little,  especially because they are busy !!",

    "text": "SBC VEGAS SERIES:9 of many reviews I want some sushi NOW!!!!  Its hard to find sushi during lunch hours on the strip. Mind you that I didn't have any fancy jeezus phone or other interwebz navigating phone on me so I had to depend on my simple, yet reliable and dependable intuition... and lifelines. ;D  As I walked the strip during lunch hour sunshine I was rudely awakened to the fact after epic fail after epic fail that sushi apparently only open during dinner hours. FML!!!!   I end up calling my cousin to yelp it... bare in mind he doesn't know how to use the ever HOLY YELP but does what he can for me off his interwebz capable cell. He forwards me a list and after several returned calls of being open hours later one of them responds that they are currently open. I tell the cabbie who then proceeds to drive my ass half an hour into the desert. Who knew????  WTF??  Well, I get there to this strip mall in the middle of no where and proceed to order and drink, drink and eat, and eat and drink some more. I dock them one star for the uni.. it wasn't as good as I would have expected but then again we are in the desert and I suppose should be grateful for anything shell fish. After ordering countless orders of sashimi and sushi I realize that they offer a all-you-can-eat sushi.   Oh well!  It appears that a lot of people come here for this. I had no idea what to order so I flagged the closest waiter for assistance. The helpful and over zealous staff suggested a number of oddly named rolls which we humored them by ordering. Well, I can at least tell you that their menu offerings were pretty damned good. I wish I could remember the named of the lobster covered roll that I ordered because it was indulgent. So other than the uni I had no complaints about traveling the better part of an hour to get here.   now how do i get back to the strip? o_0",

I was shocked at how much the service has changed since we last came. The hubby and I came for ayce dinner and were seated right away since we came at a good time. That was about all that was good about our time there. After being seated the waiter took our drink order and brought us our drinks. We then placed our order for 3 sushi rolls. 30 min later we left without getting any of the rolls. This is why. The table across from us who came in about 10 min received a ton of food both sushi and cooked food from the kitchen promptly after ordering while we received nothing. Our waiter kept on telling us our food was coming over and over again but NOTHING EVER CAME!! Sad really! Never coming back to this location again and DO NOT recommend this place at all!! Service is horrible and can not even tell you if the food here is still good. Really wish I could just give this location no stars!",

The uni was fresh and buttery and I liked the fried head of the sweet shrimp with ponzu. The tuna poke app was delicious and refreshing. Dinner was $26/person and we were lucky to get put in one of the private rooms. Also, the service was EXCELLENT! They were fast and kept our table clean and well maintained.  But the thing that made this place stand out in my opinion was.....their Green Tea Tiramisu. It was HANDS DOWN the best dessert that I have ever had in my life.

I don't quite remember what I had the first time coming into this restaurant, but I do remember having their blueberry parfait, and that alone deserved 5 stars! My second visit to Oyshi was for dinner, and I ordered the Ahi poki salad, the Love Affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! The salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the Love Affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll I had in a while, from what I remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! So here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask..   Well.. the parfait. It was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what I recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more ice cream and more toppings.. This time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. It also lacked the toppings I once remembered it had. Therefore, I conclude this review by saying Oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving MORE not less! =)",

The last two times I have come in, the hostess has skipped my guest and I and has seated people who came in after us first. When it happen the first time I contributed it to it being busy. But when I came in Friday night, it was pretty slow. We gave our name to three different hosts that came to the podium. We even just asked to sit at the sushi bar. They needed to clean it and they would seat is is what they said. Well another couple that walked in ten min after we did came up to the podium and the girl sat them at the sushi bar first.  When we finally sat, I told the girl that this is the second time it is happen and she looked at me in disgust laughed and went back to the podium. Hungry and wanting to just hang out with my room mate, I let her finish her shift as I enjoyed yummy sushi and laughed with the chefs.",

All you can eat sushi for $26! I ordered a la carte, but a majority of everyone did the AYCE. It is a great deal and usually, when you get such a good deal, you tend to sacrifice quality, but everything was really good. Fresh, amazing, whatever adjective you would like to use.  I really wish I could bring this place back home.  OYSHI ME!  P.S.

When we first ordered, we already gave them what we usually order all at once. Then, we were questioned if we can finish it. Of course we said yes. Then we gave them our second order which is about less than half of what we first ordered. When they came back with the albacore we ordered, they gave us a regular tuna. We asked a couple times if it was really albacore and they insisted it is. We know how an albacore looks and taste like. It's one of our favorite fish and it's a must have for us. It seems like they are trying to trick customers with a different but similar looking fish or low grade items. We've tried another sushi place that did this kind of deception before but this is a first from this place. We have plenty of good sushi places in our area but we go out of our way to go to this place. We will not be coming back here anymore and so will the rest of our  family.

    "text": "If you are a sushi snob, hit back on your browser and get a plane ticket to LA at least if not Tokyo. Las Vegas as far as I have seen as two sushi options... Buffet and the type of place you are subsidizing comped high rollers.   Oyshi is the buffet type. $21 for lunch. $26 for dinner. I did not notice anything different between the two menus. The $5 vig is likely pure the night vig.   Your options include sushi, rolls and hot dishes. Each is worth a paragraph.   Sushi. Most AYCE places save $$$ by not offering albacore, ikura, scallops, uni and other such high end items. This is not the case for Oyshi, which makes me wonder where they cut corners. That being said, I believe the sushi is the highlight of the menu. Though the rice is not prepared to sushi standards, the rice portion is fairly small compared to the fish, so this does not take away too much from the bite. The actual fish itself is pretty good considering it is AYCE. Note that each order is a fairly small two pieces, so don't be shy about ordering a lot. Do eat the rice as well, though, as you will be penalized for going no-carbs.   Rolls. Of the spider, bonsai, ebi ebi and volcano, I only liked the last two. I think the issue here is the sauces are pretty hit and miss. I think that AYCE places try to make their rolls filling, salty and sweet to induce satiation or in the case of bonsai nausea. That roll actually made me heave a little. Don't order too many rolls. It is sort of like how most of the menu is rolls like casinos mostly place slot machines on the casino floor. It's the most profitable.   Last and definitely least is the appetizer menu. All the meat items suck. The beefs are stringy and sweet sauced up to disguise their cheapness and the chicken is dry. Don't waste gut space. If you wanted a nice surf and turf combo, you should be at a fine steakhouse. I was disappointed, but having a good appetizer menu at an AYCE sushi place would just be a bonus. I think some of the non-meat stuff is fairly safe, such as the miso soup (though don't expect the world).   Drinks. Didn't sample the alcohol, but you have your usual assortment of sake and beer. Since I was there for lunch and was still tired from the previous night's drive, I passed. Tea is $2.50 in case you wanted to know and is pretty good to share since it is a flat fee for one pot with free hot water refills.   Though Oyshi is in a strip mall on a nondescript corner of the Vegas suburbs, it wants you to think that you are in Caesar's Palace. Not necessarily a bad thing.   There are two back rooms to accommodate large groups. Lunch is fairly quiet. I would expect dinner to be loud with the drinking and the karaoke.   Services is good during lunch. Attentive and even proactive about making sure you order a lot. Nice.   Overall, it is a good value at $21. This continually justifies my urge to stay away from the Strip for dining. Just don't expect tsukiji quality or anything and enjoy the relatively cheap eats.",

    "text": "Oyshi Sushi place that I pass by few times and believe might have gone long time ago. Unfortunately nothing really stood out for me or remember wow factor so took longer time too come back. Nowadays in Vegas AYCE sushi is so competitive and dime dozen that it really hard too stand out unless really good. My opinion the sushi is good but not great or definitely no Wow factor for me. The menu has a nice diversity too it between the appetizers (oyster on the half shell by far my favorite), nigiri, and speciality rolls (i had some kind of spicy tuna roll; sorry forget the name but was really good)  too choose from sure find something like. Whenever I go AYCE more all about the nigiri style because feel that the True barometer of quality of the fish. I felt like compare too other places especially my top spot sushi house goyemon not in the same class. The irony was originally went too sushi hour goyemon but the wait was ridiculous. Me and Roy was hunger so decided too check out something new. Thankfully on this night Oyshi Sushi not packed went right in and sat down went sushi crazy!!   The restaurant is lot more open then most AYCE so usually not lot of waiting too sit down. They do have private rooms for big parties. Not sure if charge extra but nice option too know if party of eight or more. The sushi bar is decent size with two too three sushi chefs going at time. Most part even on say that night half packed we were getting our sushi in timely manner. The server was great keep up on everything and even nice enough towards the end we ordered one too many speciality rolls (thanks Roy) she like no worries no forcing not going too charge us for waste! Think that was really cool!   I like that the restaurant is open because you can have conversations without screaming with other person sitting next or across from you. Oyshi Sushi is place that come back too again but with so many other ones and not that high on my list. Not sure when next time will be but if in the area and out of options good choice.",

When I first discovered this place, I was so enamored by their flavor and service, that I told every single person looking for a good place to eat, local or tourist, that they HAVE to go to Oyshi Sushi and get AYCE!  I'm a big fan of nigiri and I highly recommend their nigiri because the ratio of fish to rice is 80-20. The fish they use is very fresh and they use a huge slice! OMG! My top list of nigiri: Cajun albacore, salmon, and eel! Have to have it every time.  Also highly recommended: Love Affair, Salmon Lover, Sunrise, and Red Dragon.  Their appetizers are awesome as well, but the ones that stick out the most that some sushi bars don't have are: Surf & Turf, Potato Croquette, grilled beef asparagus, and the Unagi (eel) bowl! Mmmmm!  They also do dinner reservations if you have a large party coming. They have VIP rooms that can accommodate large parties if you call ahead.  I've sat in their VIP rooms and their chairs are extra comfortable. The dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it's feel and vibe. If you speak to the sushi chefs, they're pretty funny too! And if you're cool with waiting a little bit to be seated, get your Oyshi on!",

    "text": "4.30.11 I definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, it was cute for a huge restaurant. It was dim, but not to the point where you can't see anything. I really like their sushi bar it's really big. The tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. I'm not used to Japanese Restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. They had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. There were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. I really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. It was actually the only painting I saw throughout the restaurant.   I have never eaten at an AYCE sushi in Las Vegas away from the strip so I was super excited. I ordered their Agedashi tofu and it was so Salty! Stay away, ha ha. I was disappointed but quickly got over it when I tasted their poke salad. I remember ordering the Kimono Roll, Yellow Trio and dessert. I had more than that, but I was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted I was too excited to remember to write it down. When I ordered I stayed away from tempura or anything baked. I was not going to get full off that, I wanted fish. Their sushi was fresh and I especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. I really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover.   Their Service was super duper good, although for some reason I was the last one to receive my order. That made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while I was still waiting. Ha ha. Do not pass up on ordering their Mochi Ice Cream. Doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.  So overall, next time I will definitely come here for their AYCE! Their selection of rolls for their AYCE is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. This one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. Just the way I like it!   Don't be a fool and miss out on this wonderful meal..",

Kind of ruins the ambiance for me but food is good",

Went there during dinner the second time and was disappointed at the front desk hostess. We waited for about 10 or so minutes (she was on the phone the whole time ignoring other customers) until they cleared a table for our party of five in the main dining area, BUT she immediately sat a party of 2 and another party of 5 who came in after us at the other area behind the front desk...so how come we were not seated there when we came in??? There was an empty table that we can see while waiting...When the hostess sat us, neither a smile nor a word...when she brought our bill, i had my hand up to reach for the tab and she flopped it down the table ignoring my hand out...when we left no thank yous, nothing...talk about customer service...this is the kind of attitude that makes you hate the place...people not the food.....I will go back but if i see her behind that desk i will look for another place....",

Got there at 3:30pm with my other half was gonna go sit at the bar since it wasnt that packed maybe like 3-4 people sitting then one of the servers stopped us this short asian server and said it will be a few minutes because they only had 3 servers. There was 7 tables occupied and 3 people at the bar and 1 large party in the back, i mean i guess they are rookies and couldn't handle a party of 2. so we waited. 3:44 rolls around and decided to ask again then he said that he's waiting for the 4pm servers to show up! Wtf? U coulda told us that in the beginning or at least got us sat with glasses of water. So we left and NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN. HORRIBLE SERVICE!",

The hostess, same one every time, literally rolls her eyes whenever someone enters and when approaching the podium, she doesn't even greet you with a welcome or anything, it's simply \"how many?\" And that's it. Then, after numerous of times coming here with our 1 and 2 year old, today, we are charged kids price for the all you can eat, when all the times before, each server did not even charge one cent for them since all they eat is the rice and miso soup (which tastes like salt water now.) The server we had was a woman today, Asian accent, long hair, and I don't even know her name since she never introduced herself and her name wasn't on the receipt. She was cold and couldn't even put a lid on a child's water cup right, which spilled everywhere when I picked it up. The food, although some were hits, majority were misses. The house salad tasted old, the cold tofu was room temp, the California roll was loose and not tightly rolled... Basically if you're ordering anything other than white rice and their ribeye sizzling plate, don't expect much! Overall, I am disappointed that this restaurant has declined over the 2 years we've been coming here, and no wonder for dinner on a Sunday night, there was more open tables than filled... And we still had to wait 15 mins to be seated!",

Everything was brought out on time and made well. Our waitress was nice and took our orders as quickly as possible and made sure each person got their orders right. My husband and I decided to try this place in the near future just the three of us when we can.  former review from 3 years ago: 2 Stars How this place ever got a vote for best sushi place in Las Vegas is beyond stupid. I know going there on father's day might have been a bad idea for AYCE. So 6 of us went in at 2pm. It was pretty full but people were starting to leave.  Yes we were seated immediately ( Which explains 1 star) and our first order of rolls and appetizers came out quick enough ( 1 more star) but they didn't even bring out ALL the first orders. I ordered a pink lady and it didn't even come out until 40 minutes  and it was my 1/2 of my FIRST ROLL. Then when it came out it looked like a 6 yr. old just grabbed mayonnaise and some seafood and loosely rolled it in soy paper. It was so big it fell apart. They might as well have just jammed the thing in a rice bowl and given me a spoon.It also tasted like the seafood part was sitting out.   At least the waitress that helped us was apologetic. I'm not returning here ever and if I was invited to come here I would just decline. I still rather go to Sushi Bay off warm springs for their faster service and better variety of sushi",

The first time I was picking up my food, the total was something like $19.20 and I gave the very polite man a $20 bill. He didn't bring me any change, but asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited. I though maybe when he brought me my food, he would give me my change but he didn't. I was going to tip him but since he never even mentioned my change, I let that be his \"tip\".   The next and last time I went I got to go food again. It was the same guy and he took my order and the total was $43.50. I have him $45. So this is actual paper money now so I thought he would totally bring me my money back this time. Again, very polite, asked me if I wanted something to drink.....and never mentioned my change again! It's not the money that bothered me, it's the assumption that really irritates me. Now you may ask, why didn't I just ask for my change. Well it's kinda simple, why should i have to! He lost a customer and a word of mouth review for $1.50.   I was almost tempted to try this theory again and pay for something with a $100 and see what the result would be. Does he only keep a certain amount of money, would something over $20, $40 $50 be pushing his luck....  So in short, the food is pretty good, the thieving man is very polite but I don't like when someone just assumes that my change is his tip.",

I live about 5 minutes away so I'm always glad to support my neighborhood businesses. But this place is really worth my time and money. I really like their ayce menu as they always have specials. I love the salmon toro for example and sometimes they do a yellowtail special as well which is worth trying.   They also have a number of great apps, like baked mussels or surf and turf skillet, that are ayce, and my mom loves them.   I also like that, unlike some of the other popular ayce sushi places in the area, the wait here is never crazy. If you come here on a regular weekend night, it shouldn't be anything more than 10-15 min wait.   Lastly, if you have a small party, sit at the bar as you can order half rolls to try out more things on the menu.",

Apparently that's more than 6 people so we got charged for gratuity. I think that's unfair because it's only 5 people and if the service was good, then I wouldn't mind paying 18 percent of our bill. But service was terrible, our waters were empty, I had to keep asking about orders because they take so long, and I had to ask them to clear the table before brining out more food. So the service was terrible and I shouldn't have to pay gratuity that wasn't good. It should be a choice. It is still unfair to have to pay for babies who are just sitting there, and not eating.",

It seems that our order isn't right somewhat often, but when I expressed frustration today our server did take one of the rolls off and apologized so I really appreciated that. She was very sweet about it.   Edited: I appreciate the owner's response, but it was 3 pm and dead inside the restaurant. I go there for lunch frequently, but service is always slow no matter what :) food is good though",

They are usually playing the top 50 charts over the radio and their staff has the young, hip, friendly vibe  They have an all you can eat menu that's $22 for lunch and $27 for dinner (I think that's for weekends). I usually stick with that because 2 specialty rolls alone would equal to the price of AYCE.   I went for a friend's birthday and we shared all kinds of yummy appetizers, this really tasty sake and of course all of our rolls.  Everything was fresh and tasted pretty good. I would suggest the atomic bomb, pretty spicy but really good. I couldn't take a picture fast enough because it was devoured in seconds.   My only wish is that they had more options with spicy mayo or ponzu sauce. They had a lot of rolls topped with eel sauce which  is not my go to but it's doable.",

For some reason the fish this time wasn't as appealing and the quality was very poor...I usually eat way more then I had this night because the food was just \"off\".  On the way home I felt the food sitting in the middle of my stomach. I tried to resist vomiting, but I couldn't hold it back anymore and eventually threw up my food. It tasted like shellfish which I did consume that night. Later that night my boyfriend became sick. We eat sushi as well as oysters regularly and have never been sick anywhere before. We also used to frequent Oyshi too, so we thought ya know shit happens maybe something did tonight. So my boyfriend  called and made a complaint and asked for a refund for the food...not our drinks or even the large tip we left...just the food. The owner made it a bit of a hassle like we were trying to get one over on him which I'm sure happens but this wasn't the case or we would have made a larger deal about it and asked for a full refund of our check including tip. Finally after days of back and fourth calling we were refunded for the exact price of the ayce without the tax included. Pretty cheap considering my boyfriend and I both got sick. Due to the poor handling of the refund on their end we don't think we will be back. We get stuff happens and would have loved to come back had we been treated better about our issue.",

My favorite roll was the Monster: soft-shell crab, shrimp tempura, with crab mix, topped with eel and avocado. It was so big I could barely fit the whole roll in my mouth. Note, they don't add cucumber to many of their rolls. AYCE is $27 for dinner, with dessert included. Reasonable, in my opinion. Becoming my go-to spot for sushi in Southwest.",

I also think they forgot some of the rolls we ordered which was somewhat irritating but we just ordered again.  Get the rolls! The fish to rice ratio is awesome. The rolls are smaller than you'd expect though so don't be afraid to order lots. The gyoza and poke bowls are delicious.  Fish was fresher than I would have expected which was a pleasant surprise. They have oysters on a half shell as well. And uni!!! One per customer but still great.  The green tea creme brulee was awesome. Tons of matcha flavor. Don't bother with the  green tea ice cream though - worst green tea ice cream I've ever had. Also don't bother with the yakitori it was disappointing.  Overall it was a successful first time for ayce sushi. I'd come back here again when I'm in Vegas.",

Our drinks and food are coming out without us having to wait and it was very enjoyable.  I really enjoyed a couple of the rolls and the Uni.  The uni is very well priced at $6 for two pieces which is a little low compared to other sushi bars.   I recommend this place to all sushi lovers...  sorry no pics, I didn't think about it til the food was gone.",

We didn't even have water to drink until the end of the meal and we had to ask for it twice from two different waiters.

    "text": "This is one of the best AYCE sushi joints out there. Their fish is fresh and the portions are right. The sushi is big enough for you to actually taste it, but at a size where you don't get full quickly. My staples at any AYCE sushi joints are eel and avocado handrolls and nigiri. I'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. They also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. I really like their seaweed salad, which is quite the generous portion. Seaweed salad is expensive and this place does not skimp out. The albacore is especially good at this restaurant. They have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. I have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. I would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. The appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. Try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. With this said, the best part truly is the dessert. This place by far has the best tasting Creme Brulee I have ever had. The only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. Make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. I have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time I'm in town. The service has been great during both of my visits. The food is usually out at the right time and you never have to wait too long for your orders. The waiters are also really sweet. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!",

Trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode.   I will start off with the non-rolls food: Must get the surf and turf, ahi poke, sashimi salad, skirt steak, grilled asparagus and beef. There were a few other items that I would like to try next time. There were simpy so freaking many. For rolls, try the Nuclear Bomb Roll, Lobster Fair, Paradise Roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything! For desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu.   The service was also great and very attentive. They will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. So trust me, if you're in Vegas, give this place a try.",

With that said, AYCE sushi is not as amazing as \"regular\" sushi places (i.e. Sushi Fever, I love Sushi, Sushi Loca, etc) but Oyshi is always consistent when it comes to quality and quantity. Definitely worth a trip if you're looking for good AYCE sushi.",

The menu contains things like sushi, beef, oysters, etc. When you order, it's appetizer/ tapas size so you're usually left ordering more, and more, and more. The food is great, pretty quality stuff.   Atmosphere is nice, pretty modernized decor, nothing fancy but classy. I like that they have private rooms for those looking to have an event celebrated there. We went there for a friend's birthday and the room that we had fit about 8 people comfortably and even had a TV in there. We were able to watch a football game. I believe that there is another room that fits more people.   Service was great, they took real good care of us and even gave the birthday boy ice cream with a candle and sang happy birthday. The times that we sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs chit chat with you.   When we're craving sushi and know that we're bout to consume lots of it, we go here.",

(maybe it sat out too long before being served as well). * Water glasses were never serviced nor were we asked if we wanted anything else to drink. * The time waiting to be seated succeeded the time spent eating at the table * Overpriced less than average fare for an over-rated joint.  Will I return? Sure...if I sit at the sushi bar & someone else pays.  Truth! deez out.",

But it's all good after eating a gripload of sushi, all you need is a order of one of there deserts, which they are also bomb diggity lol. I also like the fact that this place is very nice and clean  Now here's is why I did not give this place all 5 stars.  The reason is there service. It's a hit or miss with this place. Unfortunately there is like one or two servers who are freaking awesome as hell with there customer service and always brings food out really quick. I can't really say for the other staff members. It seems most of them got a attitude problem or something when you order and are hella slow. It which is kinda sad. Hope they start changing soon cause its kinda hard to go back when you have a couple of bad experiences with a place.",

Last time I went, had to wait 20 mins for a table (it was a little busy) and the waiter did not come around as much as I had hoped for. Our water and teas were never refilled without asking. But the other times I have gone prior, service was fine.  When it comes to sushi at Oyshi, ah, I've had better. Their spicy tuna for me was too mushy. I like spicy tuna when the tuna is cut into chucks then mixed with the spicy mayo. So, I was quite disappointed with that. The salmon nigiri was fresh and quite tasty though. I try to stay away from the rolls because they are huge, will become quite full from one roll.   Whenever I find myself at Oyshi, I tend to order a few nigiris then I ransack the appetizer menu! lol. I love the steak. It comes out sizziling on top cabbage and onions. They also have, shrimp/vegetable tempura, bacon wrapped asparagus, scallop poppers, oysters, agedashi tofu, etc.  Oyshi used to be a favorite of mine for AYCE sushi, but after discovering Island Sushi... I don't know if I will be back to Oyshi.",

They have hand rolls, cut sushi, baked, deep fried, fusion, vegetarian, specialty, and sashimi (this isn't included in the AYCE price though).  You can also have some appetizers and various salads, rice bowls, and dessert with the AYCE price.  For the two of us with regular drinks, we spent $61 ($71 with tip), so as you can see, it can get pricey.    Now, for the review of the food.  We ordered AYCE and we ate our fill of sushi.  My order: 1) Deep fried Philly - loved it!  It was cooked well and not dried up.  The sauce on it is enough that it doesn't require soy sauce to enjoy. 2) Rainbow Roll - so fresh and tasty. 3) Tiger Roll - it was so beautiful and enjoyed it immensely. 4)  Double Salmon - I enjoy salmon so this was a no brainer.  My partner: 1)  Supreme Vegetarian -  he liked it but it was wrapped in soy paper.  He liked the veggies that were rolled in the \"sushi.\" 2)  Hawaiian Roll - this is a definite thing to order! 3)  California Roll - they were done well as they should be.  It is a staple in any sushi place. 4)  Japanese Lasagna - this one is baked.  He wasn't a fan of cooked sushi.  Then, the heavenly bites of dessert came.  My partner had the Strawberry Mochi and I had the Creme Brule.  I have to say, the Creme Brule was a taste of heaven.  I was so glad we got this for sure.  To end my LONGEST review(so far), this sushi place is definitely a go to place for us.  The ambiance was awesome, the food were tasty, and over all, its a definite place to try out.  Just be sure your wallet can afford the bill.",

    "text": "My coworkers and I went here after shift .. we arrived 12:30am, we were told that last call is at 1am. They were going to close early that day. (Last call is usually 1:30am).. anyways, the reason why my friends and I went there is because one of us had a birthday. But the birthday boy was running late. He arrived after 1am, (past the 1am last call for that day) but they still took his order which I thought was kind of them to do. We didn't finish our food, but we only had to pay for two rolls extra. Again, that was a nice surprise. I was expecting to pay WAY more for the leftovers. I was highly expecting them to be mad or to show sings of irritation because they ended up not closing early and instead closed at the regular time of 2am. We were one of the last two groups there.. They were very accommodating throughout the whole time. Our server, Tony/Toni, was very friendly. She was very nice and always smiled throughout the whole dining experience. I think she was the one that recommended the 'love affair' which was really good!!! Anyways, during dessert, one of my friends joked around saying they were going to bring the birthday boy cake, but said it only as a joke. He said 'just kidding' and mentioned it was our friends bday which is why he said that. Tony/Toni asked if it really was our friends bday and later she came out with a green tea looking cake. I was very happy with the service !! The food was really good, but for me, service is important.. If a restaurant has good food, but really bad service, I would most likely not go back. Well Oyshi had good food AND great service! I am sold. I will be going back here soon! :)",

    "text": "I love sushi.. and this place is just okay. located very close to me so I end up going here a lot and it's always iffy. Their one manager who has been working the last couple times I've gone is amazing. He's very attentive and talks to the tables and makes sure everyone has what they need. If he is not there.. it's not the same. The service is below average. If they are the slightest bit busy.. you have to wait sometimes 20 minutes before the server will even remember she has you at her table to put another order in. This can sometimes be good because if it's AYCE, you're completely hungry after waiting 20 mins between each roll... we also paid with cash once.. 12 over.. and never got our change. and the service was terrible that time. so really? you're just gonna assume the rest is your tip? mmm no. and then she never returned to the table even though we sat there and waited for quite awhile. oh well.. the food itself though is usually amazing. I've never really ordered anything that I didn't like. Except the mochi for dessert. everywhere else I go they cut it into quarters for you and sometimes even decorate it with chocolate sauce (sushi wa on eastern.. recommend there waaay over this place) .. but not this place.. you just gotta bite right into it and man does that hurt my sensitive teeth. But again, the food is good, and if you go on a less busy night the food comes out somewhat fast.   Also, it can get pretty cramped. Last time I was there they sat a larger table next to us and put a chair on the end. I literally could have rested my head on the guys shoulder who say there. Really? I understand about wanting to accommodate every guest that comes in.. but what about the comfort ability of the other guests already there? mmmm not my favorite place yet I keep returning so it'll get 3 stars.",

    "text": "We went for a late lunch.  The place wasn't crowded yet the service was a bit slow.  We were seated at the sushi bar but the sushi chefs seem to engrossed with their work that we had to wait to catch their eye so we can put more orders in.  Good thing there was some kind of shift change and the newer chef at least asked us once if we wanted to order more.    As for the food, we started off with nigiri sushi, then moved on with the specialty rolls.  I quickly realized that their fish wasn't 100% fresh when it was laying simple and bare as nigiri sushi.  However, they do concoct good sauces and compose interesting rolls (maybe to compensate for the lesser quality of the fish).  The weird thing I noticed when we ordered unagi... In all other sushi bars I've been to, unagi is broiled for a few minutes before making it into sushi to give it nice caramelization.  Here, they skip it, and while the unagi seems slightly warm, it was not crispy and the flavor was a bit muted (I think broiling intensifies the flavor).  I guess next time I will ask them to make it \"extra crispy\".",

This was a special occasion for several occasions:  we were meeting after knowing each other online for ten years, it was a few days before my birthday and most importantly, I'd never eaten sushi before. I told him to pick somewhere really special and where I could try several different things because I wasn't sure what I'd like.  He said that Oyshi was all you can eat, which meant I could sample just about anything I wanted.  We ordered everything. This little guy put away about 18 pieces of yellowtail.  I tried it and it was ok, though the rolls were definitely the star.  The fried calimari was amazing.  We ordered fantasy roll, sexy roll, love affair, and dragon roll.  It was all amazing! if I had to pick my favorite, it was the love affair.  We also got seaweed salad, sweet shrimp, and fried scallops. The only thing I didn't care for was octopus, but it was a personal preference.  it was amazingly good, all of it, and they were so nice! Service was excellent and since 2 people in our party were almost an hour and a half late, they even let us stay longer than the two hours allowed.  It was the best first experience having sushi that I could've had!",

I find if you sit at the sushi bar and just ask the chefs for your order the menu is not very stringent and they are happy to really make you anything you ask for. I found the service of our waitress to be pretty bad. My drink was only refilled once and she was very inattentive. Quality of fish is always good and have never had a problem besides how full I leave. The other options are also very good, I always order the seaweed salad and seared ribeye steak which comes on a sizzling hot pan with cabbage and onions and is a great option on the AYCE menu for those that love a surf and turf. I say the food is great for the price, and the place is only getting 4 for the value I got which is something I look for. But the service was lacking. Still worth a trip!",

I have tried other sushi places, but Oyshi is by far my favorite. I love their baked rolls and appetizers. My favorites are the hot tamale roll, the Japanese lasagna, spicy tuna crunch, potato croquette, egg rolls, Yellowstone, and quite a few others. The sushi chefs behind the bar are very nice. I rave about this place to basically everyone I know. Lol. It gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. Sometimes we get a really great server who is very attentive to us, but other times we sit there forever before a server finally notices us. Or they take forever to refill your drinks...or they take your first order and forget you're there. It is a little pricey, but so worth it! If you want to eat or try a lot of stuff, definitely go for the all you can eat!",

The restaurant was nice, plenty of open space with good music playing.  We went there for the \"all you can eat\" menu and we were not disappointed. There are only a few sections on the menu that were not included in the all you can eat price, but other than that the majority of the menu was free range. From appetizers to desserts, countless rolls and entrees this place really was a feast for the eyes and stomach.  But the only downside, there's only so much sushi you can eat before it just gets gross. After a few appetizers and 3 or 4 different rolls, we were ready to call it a night. From experiences at other sushi restaurants, this place was mediocre. The fish could have been fresher, but I'm guessing with the \"All You Can Eat\" staple on their menu, they get whatever fish they can and throw it in a roll.  This place was cool, but the long drive and mediocre cuisine left me wanting more from a sushi restaurant than just looks. I'd go back, I just wouldn't get the all you can eat offering again.",

    "text": "Dawn C. and I decided to try a new place today for our sushi lunch, and decided on Oyshi based on the Yelp reviews and the fact that it was close enough to my work for me to get there eat and get back in around an hour.   Oh, am I ever glad we decided to try a new place today! Oyshi is great, $21 AYCE lunch with a huge selection to choose from. We sat at the bar and had almost impeccable service. We did to request plates (they did not bring them out with the wasabi) but everyone that helped us was so pleasant and upbeat, and our drinks were refilled without us ever having to flag someone down. Our check was also brought out before we requested it, which I always appreciate when I am on my lunch break.   We started out with some edamame, which is serves warm with a sprinkling of salt. We also tried the beef wrapped asparagus because a reviewer recommended it. It was ok, but I was there to eat fish not beef... so it was on to the rolls. We tried the Red Rock, a new roll called the Sexy something-or-other, Baked Philadelphia Roll and the Japanese Lasagna. All were very tasty. Some people may be turned off by the amount of sauce put on the rolls but I personally liked it. Rolls that come with sauces on top say so on the menu so if that's not your style, just ask the sushi chef to leave it off!   For desert we had the green tea tiramisu and the berry parfait. The blueberries on the parfait were still crunchy from being frozen, and the tiramisu wasn't really as good as I had hoped. But I was so stuffed from the sushi it's probably better for my figure that the deserts weren't to die for!   I will certainly be revisiting Oyshi on another lunch break in the near future.",

I've been to Vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on The Strip, but Yelp claimed otherwise.  The good: The food was, overall, fine. We didn't do All You Can Eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). Both were excellent. Nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. We had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. I also had two orders of nigiri.  The bad: We arrived around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was MAYBE half full. It more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. It was 40 minutes before I saw any of my order. The (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free miso soup to help pass the time. Meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. Completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.  Other issues: I asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. My aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji I've ever eaten on top. It tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got.",

Every dining experience has been excellent - the service is always friendly and attentive and food perfectly cooked/prepared.   We did a few ala cartes but most of the time it's always AYCE, both lunch and dinner.  Heck if they had breakfast I would do that too.    Most sushi places have a few items that are exceptional and a few not so great, but everything here range from good to phenomenal.    Let me talk a bit about their sashimi items.  I love sashimis and this place has some of the best sashimis i've ever eaten.  Their Seared Albacore with crispy onion in ginger sauce is oh so heavenly.  The only  problem is their sashimis are not included with the AYCE menu and that's understandable because the sashimis are pricier.  Another one is the Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and ponzu sauce.  OMG this melts in your mouth and it should be called screaming orgasm for your mouth!  amazing stuff!  How about this \"Tuna sashimi with shaved daikon in a chef special sauce\"? Everytime i finish this plate I want to lick the sauce off the plate but there's always people around me.    Now for their rolls.  They make the typical rolls like Rainbow, Dragon, Spider, Dynamite and Catepillar taste amazing.  Flavor explosion with every bite.  They have a few rolls that are wrapped in thin soy paper sheet that are not as filling as the ones with rice.  Some days I do low carb and i would order a bunch of these.  Pink Lady and Oh My Heart are my favorites.  If you like scallop make sure you order the Volcano, baked scallop with yum yum sauce.    Side dishes and appetizers are very small when you order with AYCE and that's a good thing cuz you just want to taste the variety of stuff.  Finish off with some mochi's and you can die happy.",

    "text": "Oyshi was my first AYCE experience here in Vegas.  At first I thought it was one of the better AYCE sushi places in Vegas but lately it has gone down hill. Case in point my last visit.  We had a party of 6, waited about 15 minutes to be seated.  I've been here when it has been busy and tonight it wasn't that BUSY. We made our first round of orders and waited, waited some more and waited.  It was a good 25 minutes before we got our first round.  We didn't receive our complete order, I just said eh never mind. We ordered some more, and I ordered some Uni and oysters for our group. Again we waited, and waited again. We got the rest of our FIRST order and got some of the second but no uni or oysters. So I ordered some nigiri to hold me over until the uni and oysters came. My nigiri came but not the other items, finally the oysters came but no uni, i asked our server where is the uni and i she tells me 'oh, we ran out'. I was like WTF! Shouldn't you know that information before I ordered it or at least kept me updated. At this point some of my party was clearly upset and just ordered dessert but guess what? They were OUT of some the dessert items too!   This last visit was VERY bad, I hope they improve cause I like this place a lot because they offer different items from other AYCE.  FYI: The table next to us, got up and left and never paid, I think it was due to the poor service they got.  I'll be back, MAYBE",

When my family, and I arrived we waited six minutes to me seated there was no host so a waiter finally came to us and asked how many where in are group. It took the waiter over ten minutes to take are order. My wife and I order all you can eat sushi, we told the waiter which rolls we wanted to eat first that order took twenty minutes to arrive at my table. When we finished that order we had to ask a bus person to hunt down are waiters to place another order of sushi. We ended up spending over two hours eating sushi not because we ate so much but because it took for ever to place orders and to receive it. The sushi is not all good as I remember it being in the past I will not be going back.",

    "text": "Thanks Neal V-G for recommending this place!! Great place to eat before a bachelor party.  5 Star rating for sure, here's why: Came here after a 3 hour trip from Los Angeles. Arrived around 4pm, with a group of 12. Was seated promptly in the back private room. Drinks were served quickly, left us with a large jug of ice water= awesome. Waiter was very polite and patient with our large group of guys. We all ordered different rolls and shared them. Each roll was delicious. Presentation, taste and size of content to each roll was perfect. I remember getting the Rattle snake, Heart attack, Lobster fare,  shrimp tempura, miso soup, fried scallops, warm saki and calamari. Absolutely no complaints of any item ordered.  Best, made to eat, all you can eat eat (AYCE) sushi joint ever.   Caution: Do not over order!! Take your time and enjoy each item is my advice. After your first roll you will want to go berzerk and order everything on the menu, trust me just enjoy and order what you can finish. You may feel pressured by the two hour time limit, but don't worry you will have plenty of time and the food is served pretty quickly.",

Yes, it was a busy Friday night but you know what, Friday is busy, staff up already.  The portions of food and presentation are both sub par. The flavors were good but honestly I am not impressed.  It almost feels like they just want you to eat and get out.  The atmosphere is okay. The booth that we sat in had its upholstery all torn up.  Will I go again, NO.

For my niece we ordered the Cheesy Katsu meal and that came with a house salad, miso soup, and 3 sauces on the side of katsu sauce, honey mustard, and nacho cheese and a good size of katsu. The kids meals didn't come with rice so we ordered each a bowl on the side. It was alot of food for just the kids, my boyfriend and I ended up eating the left overs and we were stuffed.. it was definetly worth $6 each for the kids meal excluding the bowls of rice.  My boyfriend had the unagi bowl which was perfect as we both shared 1 big bowl of rice unagi and grilled onions which was Delish, an order of a rainbow roll which was ok, as it didn't have avocado :(  but it still took care of my craving for sushi and a salmon handroll which was ok as I've gone to other resturaunts that pack it with salmon and the slices are big.    I like oyshi.",

    "text": "So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp.   I looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out.   We arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all.   So, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.  We were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway.   Verdict,   the garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.  the albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.  the Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \"OISHI\" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up.   the cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.  my boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled.   on to the rolls,  the Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.  the Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.  the Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.  the appetizers,  the agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be.   the seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.  the grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.  the baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless.   I was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.  I knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \"I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\"  With that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there!   Hm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!  On a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.",

    "text": "Sweet! 2hr time limit for AYCE..  Too bad you'd probably need all 2 hrs of it as service here is inadequate.    The restaurant was pretty much empty with maybe 5-6 other tables with about 5 or 6 front-of-the-house staff and 2 sushi chef.  The FOH would much rather have their backs toward us and mingle amongst themselves than to help the hungry (me). Kind of funny as It felt we were sat at the table with no server or porter assigned to it.  I ordered miso soup 3 times before it finally came out.  Our water and drinks were never refilled.  Sushi took too long and they just mediocre.  It was just one thing after another making it a very unpleasant dining experience.    Only thing i have positive to say about this place is that eel sauce is extra sweet without the heaviness and they offer dessert you normally wont see at other AYCE: green tea tiramasu and creme brulee.   My friends and I just finished eating sushi here since one of them recently reside in the area and he'd mention that we should have gone to Koji sushi just down the street instead.  I'd never been there, but i couldn't agree more.",

Love that they give you small portions, so that you can try more things, and you don't get stuck trying to finish something you don't like. ~$26 per person for AYCE dinner. This includes everything on the menu except sashimi. Some of our favs were the Hawaiian Ahi Poke, Nigiri, Tiger Roll, and for dessert, Green Tea Ice Cream. It's about a 10 minute drive off the strip. Great for large parties, but make reservations. We went on a Monday night, and though we were able to get seats right away at 5:45pm, the place was pretty busy by the time we left.  We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Yeah, the Husband and I are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  But when you're living in Vegas, the only way to go is to do AYCE, right?  After getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.  All-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  It was pretty busy on a Sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.  Like Ned M. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  Perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.  We ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  As one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  Maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  I'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.    They do offer a wider selection of side items like Asian style skirt steak, ribeye steak teriyaki, etc.  And for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other AYCE places.  I do like their version of agadashi tofu though.  Limitations on their menu include: * one order of uni and amaebi per person * limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person * limit one order on desserts of creme brulee, mochi ice cream, berry parfait or green tea tiramisu (regular ice cream is AYCE though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)  Sitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  The manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  We thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  He continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  There was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.  I can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  The staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  They have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  Overall, we found Oyshi Sushi to be an average place for AYCE sushi.",

We went here for dinner after house hunting around the area and decided to go with the all you can eat option for about $25.  The all you can eat feature allows you to order anything off the menu (rolls, hot japanese items, soup, tofu, nigiri sushi, and a selection of a few desserts including mochi).  The only exception is sashimi.  Each of the rolls off the menu ranges from $12-15/per roll so I think the all you can eat is worth it if you've worked up an appetite.  The rolls are pretty good and made to order which is different from a typical Japanese buffet in which the rolls are sitting out there for who knows how long.  Service is pretty good and the decor of the restaurant is modern and clean.    I enjoyed coming to this sushi place and for $25, the food and service can't be beat.  Thanks Oyshi for a great meal.",

They tasted fresh, and not overpowered with sauce. Probably the best dish.  Surf & turf - bland and flavorless. The shrimp was super rubbery due to being over cooked. AGEDASHI TOFU- fried to a crisp, so when you cut into it.. the entire batter falls off. It should be light and easy to swallow. NIGIRI- fish quality was decent, but filled with a lot of rice. The amaebi tasted ok, but there is a part of the shrimp head that they don't clean off and discard. This makes it very difficult to enjoy, and sharp on the gums.  Asparagus Beef- asparagus wasn't shaved down enough at roots, so you get the bad stringy part stuck in your teeth if it's possible to even bite off.  Beef and asparagus, shrimp skewers - very dry, overcooked, flavorless. ( a waste of stomach space )  Overall, really nothing special anymore. They don't allow half rolls which is unusual at an ayce spot. They seem to have cut the ayce app menu down a bit too. The service was good, and attentive. However, I would rather stick to umiya for ayce. They have a larger selection with much better quality.",

Highly recommend! I gave 3 stars because the service sucks. They don't listen. They forget half your order and when reminding them they act like it's such an inconvenience to have it fixed. Other than that, the food is great!",

    "text": "Went again yesterday with a group of 7. It seems as if the service gets worse, which is a shame because the food is still great. After we placed our first orders, it took almost 25 minutes for the first items to come out. Again, this waiter forgot a handful of our items and we had to remind him multiple times. One of my friends was really upset because he ordered 5 things from the menu in the beginning and it took 45 minutes for them to bring out just one! Like I said, the food was still great but having to wait what seems forever for your plates ruins the whole experience. They state you have a 2 hour limit, but what's the point if you are waiting for your food for more than half that time?  On a plus side, they did add new items to their AYCE menu; more rolls, salads, and rice bowls. I tried most of the new rolls and they were fantastic!  This isn't a go-to place for me  anymore but it will be if the services quality catches up to the food on my next couple of visits.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been to Oyshi Sushi a couple of times and have thought that the food was good. Nothing spectacular. We have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an AYCE option. We've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but I don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.  The first time my girlfriend took my to Oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. She did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the AYCE and after she was very rude. After taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.  Our second time going to Oyshi it was fine. We were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of AYCE sushi without any issues.  The third time we went to Oyshi is WHY IM WRITING THIS REVIEW and have joined YELP and is also why I'm NOT GOING BACK THERE. We were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (Pinky) took our order of AYCE we never saw her again. That's when everything fell apart. Our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. Not only that, we always order baked mussels with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. We had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. When Pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. This waiter was \"AWESOME!\" NOT!!! The guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. I had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my GF and leave. After waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the AYCE. We were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.  Lastly, THIS IS WHY I GAVE THEM A ONE STAR...  My bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service I DID NOT TIP THEM. SO TELL ME WHY AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS MY ACCOUNT WAS CHARGED $72?!?!?!?   Those ******** CHARGED MY CARD AN EXTRA $10.38 meaning they tipped themselves and FRAUDULENTLY CHARGED my card EXTRA!!!!  At what point do they think they deserve my $10.38?!?!  Never go to OYSHI SUSHI!!!! EVER!!!",

As far as the sushi is concerned, I got my money's worth.  The fish was pretty fresh, not the freshest, but still good.  I prefer sushi that isn't drenched in sauce and the rolls that I had were good.  I got away with an extra dessert when you can only order one, thanks to our cute waitress.  The best rolls were the Hawaiian and the Yellowtail Trio.  They also have a great selection of entrees and apps to choose from.  I have had the teriyaki beef and that was really good.  They have something for everyone interested in Asian cuisine.  Whenever I feel like treating myself or my friends and family, this will definitely be the spot.",

First off I'm a manager at a retail store and customer service is a must!! So from the jump I should of know to leave and let me tell you why, it was a busy night for them obviously being a Saturday night which is totally understandable but after i proceed to put my name down,  I headed to the bathroom while in the bathroom i found myself having to listen to one of the front hostess in the bathroom on the phone cussing, crying, saying how she hates her job and the manager and so on and so on... sad part is after i came out the stall the young girl (she was the short dark hair fake lashes and could of been Mexican but look like she had some Asian in her)  just looked at me while continuing her rant. So feeling uncomfortable i went to the front to ask for the manager and just my luck she had walked up, i told her about the incident and she said she would go see the situation and figure out who the employee in the bathroom was. After that happen we were told 45min wait time which turned in to more than an hour wait again understand its busy just make sure you are telling customer the right wait times then. So as we waited to be seated the ball of sunshine aka the girl that hates her job was the one to seat us which again her attitude came out..... while she just turned from the desk and looked at me and said You can come this way with the rudest tone and attitude.. last time i checked most places call you by name or greet you by your name before taking you back to the table. But of course not her. Then as the food started coming out the quality was horrible, sushi taste old and fishy, not worth the price they are charging. So needless to say i will not be returning here anytime soon and i hope the owner or someone higher up see this because even after the manager knew the hostess had an attitude and everyone could tell she did, the manager should of pulled her aside and talked to her or sent her home especially being the first person your customers interact with, i wouldn't think that is the type of person you would want as a hostess.",

Oyshi is the best place to go for AYCE mainly because of their appetizer and dessert selections.    What I love to get are baked mussels and sizzling plates: asian skirt steak and surf and turf.  If you're hungry, these plates aren't shareable, but most of the time they are.  The asian skirt steak has a hint of sweetness to it.  It comes on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plate cooks.    The surf and turf is just a few pieces of tenderloin steak with 2 pieces of shrimp also on a bed of lettuce and onions that the cast iron plates cooks.  Very tender steak, and the shrimp was grilled to perfection.    I like to get nigiris: salmon, garlic tuna, and yellowtail.  All the fish tastes fresh.  The salmon was orange and marbleized as it should be.  You can get your tuna 3 different ways, but garlic is my favorite.  Yellowtail I got plain.  Always a good tasting fish.    Rolls:  Had a few and they were good, but none of them really caught my attention to be honest.     Dessert: Vanilla creme brulee.  I had a bite of the green tea creme brulee, and that was good as well.    Appetizers, soups, nigiris, and desserts are well worth the AYCE.",

Nothing extravagant or didn't give me a wow factor. It wasn't plated to give a wow factor or to make you excited to eat it. Which is a plus for me. The taste was a typical sushi roll taste. Nothing exciting. Our server did give us a free sake since we were still engaged in convo well after we paid our bill, and he came out with another sake on him. Which was nice and unexpected.   Would I return? Eh I have had better sushi much closer to my house. Would I recommend? Sure. It's just another sushi place to add to the list.",

I suggest the \"White Peach\" it's fruity and doesn't taste much like alcohol. Get a glass unless you're with a large group because it's a BIG glass 0.0 came here for lunch. Take advantage of the all you can eat. So get here with a big appetite.  They have fried veggies; yummy oysters!! And I recommend the Seaweed salad !! you'll love it ! Does not taste salty and gives the sushi that extra oomf :)",

The sushi bar & whole restaurant was packed so I was surprised that they sat us so quickly on a Sunday night, 10.22.17, 6:30pm.  My first time, guess we got lucky!  We ordered many items & not one was left behind.    Sizzling Ribeye plate over cabbage, side of rice, miso soup & the salad had a tasty ginger dressing & was larger than a usual side dish.  Cooked perfectly & well seasoned  ribeye, sliced.  They offer Teriyaki Chicken, Surf & Turf, Asian Skirt Steak & Sweet & Spicy Pork also.  Salmon Lover Roll, Game's recommendation was fabulous!  Lite lemony mustard cream drizzle over tempura salmon, avocado, cream cheese rolled in rice & topped w/ fresh salmon!  Delish & I will start w/ it again!  I'm not a Spicy Tuna Roll fan, but we also ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch which was fantastic.  Jalapeno, cream cheese deep fried & topped w/ spicy mayo & eel sauce so you can't go wrong.  Many rolls have cream cheese btw.  I usually look for the ones that are more fresh so next time will sit at the sushi bar & experiment.  I did love our servers recommendations tho!    Our Vegan friend got the Cucumber & Avocado roll which was also delish.  Overall, the menu is very appetizing w/ numerous items that I must come back for & I was happily surprised by everything at Oyshi.  Cheers!",

I've had times where is perfect and would recommend to somebody but its the consistency that is the problem here. Some days they'll drown the sushi rolls in sauces to the point where you can't taste the fish at all. Other times the fish will just taste off, like its not fresh. This isn't always the case and when its good its awesome, but it has unfortunately happened enough for me to stop coming to this location (more on that in a second). I understand this is an all you can eat restaurant, but I value some consistency with the food.   Service wise, I've never had a bad experience, the staff and chefs are quite nice. The price isn't bad either, it's basically in line with other all you can eat sushi places. I will say that the consistency issue may just be a problem at this location as I haven't had any bad experiences at the other Oyshi sushi here in Vegas.",

I completely forgot to check in on yelp so after we ordered I looked and got pretty scared of the low rating.   Well it's off that's for sure.   I actually really liked this place.   A lot.    The menu has a good variety of items.   The specials were interesting (and written on the wall very nicely.)  Out of all the items we ordered (believe me there are more than what is pictured here.   Lol!), the only ones I actually did not care for were the sunamono (there seemed to be some weird peanut butter or sesame paste thing on top) and the green tea tiramisu (was oily and flavorless to me.)  The other amazing thing about this place was Judy.   Probably the best server I've had in a long time (including any fine dining this past year.)  She was super attentive and seemed to really care about her job.   Definitely might make this place my new sushi joint...",

You can order individually and instead of placing multiple rolls and other orders in one big plate they served em to you personally so you could easily identify which roll is which.   One of my personal favorite rolls was the \"treasure roll\". I'd recommend trying that especially during the AYCE menu. Also for the appetizers, get the surf and turf it's shrimp and beef. Staff was really friendly and accommodating. Thank you!",

Although we enjoyed our appetizers and desserts we lacked in fulfillment in our sushi.   For a 5 order the size was well, but when it came to 6-8 piece orders the sizes were to larger as if they were buffing it with rice and lacking any taste. When eating sushi I want to enjoy it not have a mouthful of rice and if was a good size it felt as if the sushi chefs were using the crab as a crutch to fill most of the sushi. One of my most enjoyed rolls the rainbow roll consisted of no avocado, loads of crab, and poorly sliced pieces.   This is my third time here and I'll say that every experience here has been a gradual decrease of pleasure. The nigiri was enjoyable but that was all. The servers and bussers were pleasant but the sushi chefs were acting as if it was a middle school sleepover, gossiping with each other about customers instead of actually communicating with them.",

Oyshi is one of the only places that uses lobster in their dishes. I wish it was a little more distinguishable though. Mixed in with the diced crab stick, it is difficult to taste the natural sweetness of the lobster. I am not a huge mayo fan either, but did not dislike any of the dishes because of it. The fact that it was not mixed with half a jar made it bearable.  The rice is the most important part of the sushi. Even though we were there early, the rice was cooked off early enough to let it properly cool. There is nothing worse than warm fish and rice that falls apart when picked up.   The nigiri list is smaller than some of the other sushi joints, but the items we got were all fresh.",

To my surprise, the sushi was excellent! The cuts were amazingly generous and good quality too. I had to try the rolls, which I normally don't and it was great too! Didn't have any complaints at all.   We had the green tea tiramisu and it was really good, and I was already stuffed. So that says something about it.

    "text": "Well I just ate at Oyshi an hour ago and this is my experience with them. First off I should have known better to eat there when I realized me and my friend were the only Asians in the restaraunt. If you are a Expert Sushi eater you would do well to stay away from Oyshi. The Sushi Rice was horrid. It was not cooked all the way and they pack the rice way too tight. I never got three things I ordered by the time I left which was such a turn off.  Some of the Nigiri was decent however some of it tasted not so fresh. The back of my throat was itching from their fish as I am very sensitive to bad fish. The server was super sweet however she was not attentive what so ever.       My child ordered the Teryaki kids meal and the first thing she said when I asked her how is it was my chicken is dry with no flavor so I had them take it back.      They do not understand how to make rolls there. I ordered the spicy tuna which was the worse spicy tuna. They had no cucumber in any rolls which that texture was missing from every roll. I do not think they understand the proper way to make sushi.     Discouraged from the sushi I tried to order some apps to get my moneys worth.... Bad idea the salad ...bad! The Calamri was the same frozen tiny dried over cooked calamari served at other pizza bistros. The sizzling rib eye was over cooked and dry and flavorless. The mussels had a garlic soy mayo sauce which was super salty and made the mussels super rich.      This place seems to be more for those who really do not know what good sushi is. If you were raised eating sushi then I would stay far away from Oyshi.  They seem concerned when they notice a customer is unhappy yet management or the servers do nothing to ammend the situation.     I ordered Sea Urchin, sunrise roll, white tuna, salmon, garlic tuna and a few other rolls and Nigiri. The only thing I liked or enjoyed was my water with lemon.     Now all I am thinking about is the money I wasted there. I have never been so displeased ergo why I tweeted to my 16 Thousand Followers that they should never eat at Oyshi .. HORRIBLE",

Basically everything on the menu minus the sashimi's on the menu are obtainable for the AYCE deal just make sure you can finish everything you order, or pay the price. I liked the fact that the fish was actually cold to the touch when I was eating the rolls and what not...it gives me the False sense that it's fresher. Like most AYCE if you have a big appetite it becomes a better deal for you but if you can only stomach two rolls max, might be better off ordering off the menu and skipping on the deal.",

    "text": "I went to return movies at Blockbuster with my younger son and had the urge for some sushi. Since Oyshi was just across the street from Blockbuster, we stopped in for a quick sushi fix. I've been to Oyshi many times in the past, but this visit will be my last. Service at Oyshi in the past sucked, but tonight's service was just plain unacceptable.  Being a server myself, I strive to be polite, easy, PATIENT, understanding, and tip well. When my son and I walked in, we waited a good 5 mins as the manager and servers walked passed us and no one even cared to seat us. I finally flagged down a server to seat us. If the establishment was busy, that's a different story, but this was at 10pm on a Thursday with only three other tables. The girl that sat us gave us menus and asked if we were doing AYCE and I responded, \"No\"(I didn't want to stuff myself this late at night). I ordered water and told her I was ready to order, but she said she's not my server. 5 mins passed and our server came to take our drink order, and I told her I was ready to order. I ordered two waters, a miso soup, and 2 simple rolls. The waters and soup came in a timely manner, but I had to flag down a server for a spoon, straws, settings, and soy sauce.  We waited, waited, and waited(@ least 30 mins), saw other customers get their food-while thinking...did they forget our rolls??? I lost patience and called the server over & told her if they haven't yet made our rolls, I wanted to cancel. She glared at me then went over to tell the sushi chef, and he miraculously & immediately passed her a plate with our rolls! What the heck?? While we were waiting forever for our rolls, the sushi chef had them. We never even got an apology for the delay. Not once were we asked if we were ok or needed anything or even got a refill. As soon as we got our rolls, we gulped them down, asked for the check, paid, and bounced!! The rolls were mediocre. Being a good tipper, I left absolutely nothing for such horrible service(from the beginning to the end) :-/.",

Okay, if this obnoxious review cannot convince you to try it out, then perhaps all the other positive ones will!   Thanks to Yelp!, my friends took us here several months ago and the eight of us who went loved it! It seriously beat all the sushi-buffets I have ever been to. The sushi buffet menu is comprehensive! Every type of roll you can think of, Maki sushi, miso-soup, wakame salad(!!!), etc. etc. It even features menu items that even non-sushi lovers would enjoy -- tons of appetizers, surf and turf steak and shrimp, terayiki, tempura, etc. It comes with free tea, and a free dessert after your meal. And it's less expensive than a Vegas buffet!   Totally worth it!! I went again a second time and introduced it to a new group and it did not disappoint.   The only gripe I have is they have a rule that you have to eat most of the rice or there will be a surcharge. Only a slight bummer, but I cannot blame them. It is still a very fabulous place worth spending the $$$ you earned gambling!!!",

    "text": "I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.  The servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!  Now for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).  Strike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!  If you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!",

I ordered the most simple order out of all my friends, which was 3 orders of masago and 1 order of uni with quail egg. My friends ordered actual rolls(such as volcano roll) that take forever to make and they finished all their food they ordered which was more than 15 different full sushi rolls. I had to tell the server to check on my food twice to actually get acknowledged. I then asked do you even know what we are missing ? and he was about to walk off not even knowing what order he's going to go check on. I will never come back or recommend this place again. I used to be a regular here and now it's ridiculously bad customer service. I already didn't want to come here but I was content with the service last time. it was neither good or too bad. you need to hire new servers.",

Every single dish that was brought out were delicious and off the hooooooook. Especially the raw oysters, mmmmmm! (That's my favorite!)

Nice clean interior (they actually have a VIP room, guess that's a normal thing in Vegas to have everywhere though, eh?), friendly staff and an amazing deal for all-you-can-eat (AYCE) sushi.    They do AYCE where you actually just order whatever you want off the regular menu and they make and deliver it to you.  My friends Andrea, Annie and James all chowed and put away an impressive amount of sushi.  Since Annie and Andrea are bodybuilders they usually can't get full but we were all about to burst as we waddled out of Oyshi.  The nigiri are pretty decently sized and the fish is quite good.  As far as AYCE, it's the best fish I've had.  They have a ton of crazy rolls and while I am not usually a roll guy for AYCE it's fun to try out so many options.  We went for lunch and it was $21 which we definitely got our money's worth.  It's also nice to get away from the Strip as we are here covering a bodybuilding show and the pace is less flashy and frenetic which is great.  Definitely make it out to Oyshi!",

They seem to have changed some rolls and not a change for the better.  Luckily our server tonight has been wonderful, but I she will not make up for the past year.   We now go to the one on Sahara and it seems to be a lot better. This location is so much closer to our house though...",

We didn't do all you can eat because a few rolls already filled us up. It's an upbeat, young crowd, and we appreciated being able to watch the football game too! We'd definitely come back when we're craving sushi!",

Really, the food was \"meh.\"   They have a lot of options for all you can eat, and there were three dishes that were absolutely awesome: The fresh scallop, the amaebi (with the heads!), and the gyoza.   Everything else that we ordered was just ok.  A little bland where there should have been more flavor.  The worst part about the evening though, was the service.   While it was super polite and friendly, it was SO slow!  We were there for 2 hours, no joke.   My fiance and I always order in rounds, so we'll do a few orders of several different nigiri options, and by the time we're done with the first one, we'll order more.   We didn't receive several items, and had to go find a server to come back for our second round of orders.    I had thought, briefly, that I'd be willing to come back to give it another go, but realistically...even the slow service at Sumo was better than this place.    I might go back again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it, especially when the spots I frequent have better fish.",

We usually come on a weekday lunch and it's not too busy.  If you come before 3:30pm it's a little cheaper for lunch pricing.  With all-you-can-eat you have the freedom of ordering all appetizers, all sushi (excluding sashimi) and dessert to finish.  Their fish is extremely fresh and the sushi chef's will make special requested rolls if you ask. They have a great selection on their menu of specialty rolls and descriptions. If you sit at the sushi bar you have the option to order 1/2 rolls if you want to try something new but aren't sure if you'll like it.  Make sure you eat what you order. Don't be that person! If you are completely stuffed they won't nickel and dime you if you don't eat one or two pieces but don't put your server in that awkward spot to charge you. The restaurant is a big open venue and they have private dining rooms too for special events. They play great music all day and it's  not too loud during lunch. Dinner however is more trendy, music is louder, the crowds are bigger and the lights are turned low. Expect to wait on Friday and Saturday nights! I've been quoted up to a 90 minute wait!",

We had made a reservation since we were a large party, so we were sat right away even though there were people waiting outside.  Sushi was pretty good, no complaints. Definitely love the yellowtail with ponzi, garlic tuna and uni. Tried the tiger roll this trip and loved it.   The service was the only pitfall. Like I said we have been here quite a few times and the service was never amongst the best but this night was especially unfortunate. The service was extremly slow, it took about 30 minutes to get our second round of sushi and we had to keep asking our runner/busser to find our server.  The server was super nice and polite but i think they were just understaffed and not prepared for how busy the restaurant was that night.",

And yes...it's bomb dot com. We also order the usual spicy tuna roll. Here at Oyshi they make one of the best spicy tuna rolls. Some spicy tuna rolls are not even spicy...but here, there's a great kick to it.  We've also tried other rolls like Love Affair, Heart Attack ($9-13) and a few others. Didn't really leave a lasting impression.  A few days ago, we tried the JAPANESE GARLIC LASAGNA and it was yummy!!!! Soooo now I got a new roll added to my usual two.  Can't wait to be back!

We ate AYCE so we had to pace ourselves or else you will get charged for wasted food.  I would start with the salad and calamari (2 dipping sauces) Some things that I really enjoyed were the Surf and Turf (good steak and grilled shrimp) dynamite roll and monster roll. For dessert I always enjoy a classic creme brulee. The berry parfait was a berry ice cream Sundae and that was nice too. Only thing I was ehhh about for dessert was the green tea tiramisu cause it tasted like a heavier creamed cake with a very buttery taste.   Overall I thought it was a nice location with nice atmosphere. Service was fine and good was good. Would I say that is the best sushi place in town? Not quite but I am not disappointed and I would come back again.",

Our first impression was good atmosphere and hip music.  We found the service excellent, contrary to some reviews. Maybe because it was not busy or from over staffing, we were asked \"How is everything?\" every 5 minutes, even thought we were sitting at the bar.  The food was just OK. We liked the ahi poke, spider hand roll, white tuna, and especially the green tiramisu. On the other hand, we were not excited about the miso soup, bland tasting sushi, water-down soy sauce, light wasabi, and $2.50 xtra for hot tea.  Over all, we thought $67 for two AYCE including 15% tip is just a little higher than most places in town especially for average food.  We might or might not go back.",

No one wanted to even tell us that they did not have tables and what the expected wait would be. Ill wait if its worth it. I bailed and will never darken their entry again. They have to learn that there are so many options that are good out there. I drove out to Summerlin and ate at a Sushi bar on Lake Mead and Rampart called\" It's Sushi\".

Everyone asked if we needed anything often enough to keep our glasses filled and our stomachs full.   Now on to the amazing food! We had the ahi poke. Super fresh fish and delicious flavor. Ordered some hand rolls, yum yum and dragon. Once again the unagi and scallops were fresh and delicious. I have to say though that things only got better with the last two rolls. The double screaming roll and the Hawaiian roll made the meal! I used to be a huge sushi mon and wasabi fan but i think i found my new favorite.

    "text": "This place was actually really great. I have not heard of it and came here on a whim thanks to Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. This place is a nice size restaurant with a large sushi bar-, which is a super plus. The wait staff was nice and the sushi chefs were super friendly. They were super helpful as well (not to mention one that was super cute lol.) I ordered two rolls, both spicy. One had a spicy chili such and was deep friend. The other had Cajun albacore on the top - SO AMAZING. I would go there and order everything with that on top of it. The flavor was nice with a subtle kick in the back. I also had the creme brulee trio- also called the trilogy (by the cite sushi chef) The green tea wasn't good at all- way too strong but the other two, vanilla and chocolate were excellent. The chocolate was absolutely fantastic and I'm not a huge fan of chocolate creme brulee. Also the fact that they're all you can eat was only 26.95 is a super plus. They have a variety of specialty salads and appetizers you can ad onto that that looked amazing. Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for that but Ill be back! Probably next week with a friend.",

I especially love a good late night happy hour, but here it's only with the sake, not the food.  Great service, the chefs were really friendly and always checking to make sure if we needed anything. But the food (in terms of good sushi and authentic Japanese) was mediocre. It's one of those Americanized places where spicy tuna, fried California roll, and yum yum sauce are dominant on the menu and where most of the cut rolls taste the same because its all different variations of the same ingredients. I ordered their white tuna sushi and sunomono salad as well. White tuna was decent and sunomono was something errr else...cucumber was shredded thin, not sliced thin and they put a sesame peanut sauce on it instead of the usual rice vinegar. Let's just say I didn't finish it and I'm one not to waste food unless it's truly unappetizing.",

We have given this place multiple chances thinking something would change, but it just keeps getting worse. Unless you speak the language there, they don't care about your service. It's so frustrating to be sitting there for 30min, with nothing but a drink, and seeing so many others (who even come in after you) get served their food. Never again is this place worth our time or money. Definitely DO NOT recommend Oyshi if you're looking for good food or even relatively descent service",

    "text": "2 adults 1 child $23 for all you can eat lunch.  Decided we'd go for it and order a few items which we would need to pay dinner price for, no big deal. We'll get what we pay for right?... wrong!  As we were seated we waited 17 minutes to be approached by a server whom was serving 2 tables beside us. Didn't even bat an eye. I decided I would approach the hosts and ask we we had a server. She apologized and spoke to one of the 3 servers that were on floor atm. It took another 5 minutes for our server Kiki to come over and ask us if we'd like drinks AND MENUS!? Go figure. Decided I'd let it go and order our drinks and put in our food order as well.  Out of all our rolls we ordered there was one we didn't care for so I brought it to her attention and she took it. 2 other rolls came out about 7 minutes later and by this time our hunger is pretty much passed over. We were forcing ourselves to eat it. While all of this is happening there are 3 other tables who sat after us and are already eating their rolls, 1 already ordering dessert. At the end of our \"stuffing ourself\" adventure we couldn't do it all and left 4 full pieces total. Kiki came over and said \"normally we charge for left overs, but I won't this time. Next time someone will charge you.\" Hmmm 4 pieces I waited what felt an eternity for. Let's see if there is a next time. We thanked her and appreciated what she did. Now time for dessert. Another 10 minutes went by and by now all the other tables around us are gone or taken by another group. I asked for a to go box as we ordered our dessert (creme brulee & strawberry mochi ice cream) guess what Dessert came first?... the brulee, 5 minutes later Kiki approached out table to ask if we needed a refill on our beverages (1st refill) we said yes and we're still waiting for our strawberry mochi \"yea it's coming!\" Is the response I got. Cutting to the chance... we were waiting almost another 10 minutes after getting the mochi ice cream for our Check... so again I made my way to the hostess stand and Kiki was laughing away with her coworkers. Once she handed the check over I politely brought it to her attention that we waiting quite a long time for our service and everything following so I'd appreciate it if maybe she could charge us for the \"lunch\" price rather the the dinner price ($5 more) she gave me quite a look and said \"we love HELPED you with not charging for the left over rolls\".. She walked away and spoke to another lady.. in front of me as I'm staying there speaking in another language.. walked over to another server and spoke went back behind of the counter and then finally came back and said \"this is all I can do since I already helped you\" at this point I'm livid. You did not help me in fact I feel like I should have received just a simple \"I'm sorry about that this is what I can do.\" Instead it turned into a back and forth with her repeatedly telling me \"I helped you with...do you want to pay for the left overs too?... I replied \"no I'm paying for what I should and that's all I'm saying. As a person in the same industry this has gone way to far it's a simple apology that's all that should be said!\"  Kiki is by now raising her voice. I wanted to clearly get her name since she did not introduce herself as well and when I asked to see her name for the correct spelling of her name she yelled \"K I K I!\" And slapped the check presenter on to the counter...    Over all the experience would have been great but sadly it's the service that makes a huge difference as well. A customer should not feel as if they owe their server because they \"HELPED\" you for one and raising your voice makes nothing better.",

We get the same thing every time- start with poke salads and edimame, then three orders each of super white, yellowtail, garlic tuna, Cajun albacore, two shrimp and asparagus yakitori, two orders each of baked mussels, two atomic bomb rolls, a chef recommendation, then dessert. Everything is fresh, and the food is always good.  That's been our mainstay order every time. And we'll never get tired of it. The chefs are friendly, the music they play is always great (mostly R&B/hop-hop), and they just know what they're doing in there.

    "text": "AYCE sushi!! Apparently there quite a few of these places in Las Vegas, but Oyshi cannot be beat!   My cousins ordered for us since my BF and I were first timers. Some of the rolls they ordered included the Sunset, Spider, Philadelphia. And of course - lots of nigiri! The ahi belly and salmon nigiri were my faves.   Finally, dessert! we had the green tea creme brulee, the vanilla creme brulee and the green tea tiramisu. All were winners!!  Lunch for us was $22 per person. We went around 1pm on a weekday, which was great because it wasn't that busy. Be warned that the appetizers are not included in the AYCE, so be sure to ask your server what's included. Our server was helpful and gave us suggestions for various rolls and nigiri. However she got busy and would disappear for long periods of time... oh and the hot water machine was broken, so no miso soup or hot green tea :(  Cheers to AYCE sushi!! We'll be back!",

Didn't like the sushi quality or how the rolls were made. Table was sticky, which I didn't like. It made my dining experience uncomfortable.  Pros: AYCE is decently priced Short wait time to be seated Parking is easy to find Dessert was delicious Half order rolls, and hand cut options available  Cons: Tables are small Tables are sticky Service takes a long time after placing orders Seafood quality is below good Imitation crab is used Charged for extra for leftovers Music is outdated No wifi  Overall: I not fond of this sushi spot. The food is decent although the service lacked and so did the cleanliness of the establish at both locations. Bang for your buck isn't too satisfying. The dessert was good! Best part of the meal. 2/5 stars on my rating scale.",

    "text": "Oyshi Sushi is a pretty good AYCE sushi restaurant located in the SW.  After hearing my coworker praising it, I finally hit up the place with a few Meetup folks from Las Vegas and SoCal.  It is the sister restaurant to Soyo Barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another Korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more Korean flare/flavor.  The restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good AYCE sushi at a reasonable price.  The AYCE menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if I remembered correctly some salads.  They also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  Plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  There are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with AYCE, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the AYCE realm).  I Enjoyed: Sibuya No Rice Roll New Moon Roll Vegas No Rice Roll YumYum Scallop Ama Ebi and the fried shrimp heads Surf n Turf Popcorn Scallops  I Didn't Care For: Japanese Lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath) Asian Style Flank Steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional Korean Bulgogi served on a sizzling plate) Green Tea Tiramisu  Service was good, especially considering that Ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.  We were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.  Ambiance: 5/5  Great vibes. Service: 4/5  For a busy night, our service was still great. Food: 4/5  Overall, I think it is pretty good for AYCE. Price: 4.5/5  Very reasonable. Parking: 5/5  Never been a problem finding a parking space when I come to this plaza.  4 Stars!",

The amount of items you can pick off of the AYCE menu are aawesome...  You can get oysters, poke, and all of the sushi you want...of course, Sashimi doesn't count, but hey, get it all.  I like how you can pick a lot of the sides in the AYCE menu as well, particularly the seaweed salad, and the oysters...    VERY good value, good quality food, fresh sushi, and a good atmosphere to boot.  Only thing is that service can get a little non-attentive, but they're serving everyone pretty much everything, so just make sure you check up on the many things you order.",

However despite the mistake, I have to give rave reviews to how the manager Wong (I think that was her name) handled the situation. When I called back to ask to be refunded because I did not want to drive back to have my order fixed she without waiting a beat jumped in to refund me and even offered to give me two complimentary rolls on my next visit. The food has always been great and mistakes happen but it is how those moments are handled that decides whether a person returns or not, and I will be for sure. Definitely recommend the Spicy Maniac roll and the Chung Hua if you like really really spicy. They are fantastic.",

Once I got that me and my friend both ordered the surf and turf (which after 40 mins we never got so we just said f**ck it) our waitress was pretty much non existent the only person we saw was Stephen the server who was a complete douche every time we asked him if we could order he gave us the biggest attitude and said what do u want? One of my friends said to him\" well if u don't wanna take our order can u send our waitress\" who came to our table 20 mins later at this point we all order the ayce and only got 2 rolls each after 2 hours of not eating we were fed up ordered dessert that took another 20 mins to come out so after that we asked to talk to manager... Andy came out listened to our spiel and look uninterested and walked away ..not really say shit to us.. So we got out bill they took off ONE ayce and ONE sake without an apology or even an explanation...  Management and staffing need a total re-training you guys are all unfriendly and obviously don't want anyone's business .. We won't be coming back",

The people who have worked there longer seem to be comfortable, whereas those who are newer work a little harder to ensure better service. Sometimes it takes a while for a waiter or waitress to come back and check on you, and sometimes they're always there. Sometimes the food comes timely, and sometimes not so quickly, even on the slower days. Again, hit or miss.   This is a great place to bring company, as it is decently and comparably priced, clean, and modern. But we've also had better food at more hole-in-the wall places; the only thing is that it is not as presentable as Oyshi. I guess it depends on what you're looking for -- pretty decent food with a modern feel, or excellent food with a less presentable atmosphere.",

My opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. I love this place. I eat here few times a month because I can't get enough of the food! Some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. The thing I admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. I've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time!   Food: I am obsessed with their Ian's Special Roll. It has multiple layers of flavor goodness!   Things to Try: Snow Mountain roll, Salmon Lover, Tiger Roll, Surf and Turf (appetizer), Ahi poke, Baked Mussels, Grilled Asparagus and Shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. Their Vanilla Parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too.   I usually look forward to the Uni and the Oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. And it really puts a damper on my entire meal. Who doesn't want to get their money's worth!   Overall, great experience! When anyone comes into town, this is the first place I take them, and they all love it as much as I do! It's pretty amazing! I've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in Vegas!",

Some of my favorite items are the Love Affair and Japanese Lasagna rolls as well as the beef wrapped asparagus and sizzling ribeye. The quality and creativity of their menu items deserves praise. For example, the cucumber salad isn't the typical you would get at another sushi spot, they have a peanuty sauce laid on top that really individualizes it from the standard version of the dish. All that being said, I still would not say that dinner there should be several dollars higher than other ayce sushi places.   First of all, the service at Oyshi stinks, to put it plainly. Don't get me wrong, the staff is pleasant and at times can even be friendly. However, the food just comes out way too slowly. Other sushi restaurants really leave Oyshi crying in the dust when it comes to this. On top of that, they definitely pull the \"always filling up your drink\" technique to get us full. This just doesn't give your party a lot of room to appreciate all of the items they offer simply because your appetite duration can only hold out for so long.  Secondly, the dessert choices are outstanding, BUT you are limited to one special dessert! Their desserts are the best I've seen so far at a sushi place, but oh my goodness, for $26 dinners, I personally think we should be allowed to try them all one time each, at the very least! I am in love with the green tea tiramisu and the green tea creme brulee. The fruit parfait is also very tasty, anything but disappointing.  For these reasons, I award Oyshi three stars. Their food makes them a great establishment, but I strongly feel they need cater better to the customers.",

I tend to have slow moments so it wasn't until the end of the meal that realized that, with the exception of a few items, the whole darn menu (appetizers, soups, rolls, nigiri, tapas, and dessert) was included in one price! Lunch was less than $20 per adult, which I felt was a steal. The restaurant isn't on the strip but it's worth it for anyone visiting to venture off the beaten path for this great dining experience. Plus, it gives you the opportunity to see the residential side of things. This is now, without a doubt, one of my \"must-visit\" places when I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "Finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.  Restaurant design: very modern. Comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own TV, huge counters at the bar. One of the largest interiors I've seen. The only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. Luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.  Service: consistent pacing throughout the night. Could be because we were the lounge table, but I'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.  Picks:  Nigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. The spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. Smoked salmon special here is superior to Goyemon's special. Uni is the best quality other than when I tried Kaze's AYCE sashimi lunch. There were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though. Oysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me Baked mussels: solid Fried calamari: fine Lasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality Parfait: really, really good. Fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. Glad I made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.  Passable:  Dynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off. Surf n Turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. Not bad, but not great. Hot sake: average, I suppose. Best part was that it was a Mon/Tues 2-for-1 special.  Pans:  Popcorn scallop: pretty useless. Amaebi head: brain drained. I feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). Would've liked all off the flavors to be there. Ice cream: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals  Overall, I enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. It's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. I'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu.",

I felt like they also purposely forgot about us more than half the time for our orders. Or they would bring the forgotten orders that we put in 3 times as a reminder, and finally appear after 1.5 hours when we are 100% full, then try to charge us for the uneaten food.  The best items on their menu is the Lobster Love Affair and the Vegas Roll. Other than that, meh.  The service is the worst here. Good luck trying to just order for take out, they will look past you for 20 minutes until you ask them for help and even when they finally do, they will still ignore you because they have short attention spans. Mind you, I was sitting at the sushi bar with a menu in my hand and grabbed someone twice and still was not given the time of day. Never coming here again.",

They're all you can eat dinner was just about $30. I believe it was $28 something. It wasn't bad. The service was pretty prompt and the restaurant was clean and very \"organized\". I liked it. It was small, but had a very modern and cozy feel. The menu wasn't that expansive per say when it came to the variety of rolls. Maybe it's just me. I look for certain key \"trigger\" words and nothin jumped it at me. I did order the snow mountain and the Japanese garlic lasagna roll which were pretty good. Also ordered the baked mussels which are MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE THING. The thing I didn't like was they have limits on certain apps like the oysters and the mussels. Kind of a buzzkill. Overall I can't complain too much, but the place just didn't wow me. If I had the option to go out for sushi again. I'd go to the nearby \"Sushi House Goyemon\" instead. No limit on mussels, lots of roll variety, and tempura ice cream !",

Try to go for lunch, there isn't a lot different in dinner except for a higher price. Service could be improved! 8/10 times I visit, I get wonderful servers! But then theres a few times I get a server who never refills drinks, slow on taking orders, not being very attentive. Other than that I love this place! The rolls are delicious! I reccomend the Love Affair (crab and crunchy flakes) or the Crunchy Roll (popcorn shrimp and yum yum sauce) or basically everything else on the menu. You get delicious food for a reasonable price, only wish servers were a little more welcoming but other than that, this is the place!!",

Most everyone else I was with got the AYCE sushi and seemed to love every dish that came out.

The quality of service, however, leaves MUCH to be desired. It takes, on average, about 30 minutes for the sushi to get to your table from the time you order it. It totally ruins the flow of the dinner. Take today, for example. The server came to our table 30 minutes after taking our order with two dishes in her hands and asked, \"Did you order the Dynamite Roll and the Lobster Fair?\" To which I replied, \"I don't remember. It was so long ago, but I'll take whatever you're willing to give me.\" Good sushi. Nice staff. Inefficient business.",

    "text": "Random nights with good friends are always a blast!  I've always said it.  Spontaneity really makes the activity better!  So when I was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, I knew it was going to be fun.  We settled on a place one of us raved about.  I've been to Soyo restaurant many times but never Oyshi.  Time to Yelp!  The only down side of this place is the location.  I live across town from here.  Oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  First, you have one of my favorite Korean joints.  Now you have my favorite fried rice joint, Rice Trax.  This location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  Although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  Love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  Our service was pretty good.  Multiple servers came by our table at most times.  It was enjoyable.   For dinner at a sushi joint in Vegas, the ONLY way to go is to get the AYCE special (All You Can Eat).  This place charges a $26 price tag.  The one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  I've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  With this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  Granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  My recommendations to get the most out of your AYCE is to stick to non-rice dishes.  I know, I know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  You can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  For dinner, here's what I got, grouped in categories:  Things I loved: Seaweed Salad (with sesame seeds), Fresh Oysters (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), Baked Mussels (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), Miso Soup (always a hit), Shrimp Tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce),   Things I liked but kind of disappointed with: Ahi Poke - Bowl filled with seaweed salad, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  Kind of a disappointment.  I understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show.   Things that were questionable:  Yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - If there's any rice dish I get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. The yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  I took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what I'm used to.  Make sure it's fresh!  All in all, this place is actually good.  I'm definitely coming back for another AYCE session.  The place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  If you're looking for a good sushi joint on the SW side of Vegas, for sure check them out!",

They can accommodate large groups if you plan to throw a get together. Some menu highlights - they have AWESOME selections of sizzling iron plates of Steak Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, and Grilled Salmon. (Unlimited too!) Annnd there Calamari and Popcorn Scallops are so yummy!  Cons: NO HALF-ROLLS available except if you eat at the sushi bar. Getting your sushi orders takes a long time! We waited for over a half an hour after putting our order for sushi, so I recommend that you know what you want and putting in a large order.",

Ambiance - 5 Stars - I was kinda irritated as to why my pals were asking to meet way out here in the middle of where, and it was not a disappointment at all. The table set up is great, nice waiting area, very comfortable flow.  I felt very, very relaxed here and not rushed at all.....  3.  Food Quality - We ordered some real sushi like Amai Ebi with the fried shrimp heads and they were tasty. The Uni or sea Urchin was very flavorful and the texture was spot on.  Then, we had a bunch of westernized sushi that my pals ordered and while I cannot tell you what was in them and the conglomeration of sauces that hid the fish taste, I can tell you that as a food group, this stuff was pretty darn good. I wouldn't call it sushi, I would call it \"chop suey sushi\".  I give the food quality 4 stars.  4.  Pricing - For AYCE, the price is not bad 21 / 26 per person depending on lunch or dinner.  Many of my favorites don't qualify for AYCE, so I will be going back to clarify this as I did not pay this bill, and so I am not 100% positive. However, in reading the bill, the more traditional and higher quality stuff was not included.  I will check this as I may be wrong.  For now, I give this 4 star.  GK says, check it out!",

Fast forward about a year...we finally went back to the place that brought us together.   We got here on a Saturday around 6 pm. Fairly busy but not packed. A lot of new faces, but David remembered us as well as the manager that runs the floor (not sure of his name). It felt pretty good to be remembered and it made the meal better! I cannot eat sushi right now, but everything looked fresh. My husband said it was good, but he didn't want to rub it in my face that I cannot eat raw sushi. Oyshi has always been on par with their fish and it definitely seemed that way on Saturday.   I was able to order items from the kitchen luckily since they have a wide variety of cooked items. Calamari is good with their 2 different dipping sauces and as was their gyozas. I can't remember what else I ordered, but everything was fairly good.   I will be back when I can get some real sushi into me again! Service has always been attentive and that hasn't changed. Oyshi is a winner!",

The host said that the wait would be 30 minutes for two which was okay. We were then seated and I was fine because it seemed to be under the said time. After 5  minutes of sitting our server, Ploi, comes and takes our order : 3 orders of shrimp tempura, 1 agedashi tofu, baked muscles, and poki. 5 minutes pass, 10 minutes pass, a table next to us is seated and they place their order. Our server than returns and we place our sushi order because why not? We're already waiting. Another 5 minutes pass and the table next to us gets their food. WHAT? Then we get our sushi order and finish all of that. Then after a grand total of 35 minutes we get our appetizers. They gave us one order of shrimp tempura but it was fine we just ordered me. After that we get a roll on our table that we didn't order. A rainbow roll. I am very allergic to avocado and if a roll came to our table with avocado inside instead of outside and I ate it I would've gotten extremely sick. Food was good. Service was terrible. Compared to busier places in chinatown the service here was a joke. I will not be returning.",

First of all they sat us at a dirty table and said they would have someone come clean it. Took 5 mins for someone to get there. Another 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. Now this is beyond me 5 minutes went by before my friends sprite hit the table and another 5 minutes for my coke. Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service. That is only reason they get 2 stars instead of one. Regardless after two shitty service experiences I have no interest in returning.",

The only thing was the yellowtail nigiri (usually a favorite of mine) was a pinkish color? huh? Probably wouldn't recommend that.  Rolls are AWESOME! Snow Mountain roll, all the of the baked stuff is good and tuna or salmon nigiri are really good. They don't drench sauce all over it to cover the quality, which I love.  Desserts: creme brulee (pretty good. 4 stars)                    Mochi (exactly like the mochi icecreams you get at the grocery store. 4 stars)                   Green tea icecream (didn't have it but heard it was decent too)  I think I just liked the fact that it was included in the all-u-can-eat package.

WTF??? i ordered my dessert paid my check, gave them a 20% tip for the food and promise i will never come back even if it was for free.   i was hoping this was going to be a great experience because once i tasted the food, i fell in love with the freshness. nonetheless, i am loyal customer anywhere i step foot in and it would have been sooo convenient. no matter how great the food, if you don't have customer satisfaction, you will never have them coming back!",

The hostess was no where to be seen, so we had to wait 20 minutes before someone even noticed we were there. We finally got seated, got out drinks, and ordered our first selection for the all you can eat sushi. However, we had to wait 35 minutes until even just our appettizer of the small surf and turf came out. After that it seemed like we were invisible to the waiters before we even got one to awknowledge that they were having staffing problems and that we should wait another 15 minutes for our sushi to come out. When we finally got the sushi it was horribly made and cold (we ordered a baked sushi). I happened to order calamari for my 2nd selection after finishing the 1st. That never came. After being ignored for a few more minutes another waitress came by to see if we would like anything, I was already super pissed by that time so I just ordered a dessert and asked for the check. The $26 for a dinner all you can eat sushi was not worth it. So sad that this place did not meet up to my expectations",

It was also the first time I actually saw terriyaki chicken made into a sushi! Since we had a group of 11, we were put in a room to ourselves how awesome was that! On top of that they closed at 2am on Friday and Saturday so it was easy for a group of friends to get together after 10pm;p I can't wait to go back here!!",

When it gets busy, sometimes the timing of the food is a bit late, but I completely understand circumstances when the whole restaurant is filled and there's a waiting line at the door! This place looks especially busy during the weekends!   Their menu is great! There's tons of options to choose from. They are a bit pricey but I believe it makes up for the quality of the food. Their specialty rolls are to die for!   My last visit was just superb! Our server was really genuine and kind. He would always check up on us and make sure we were okay while we were waiting. I wish I remembered his name, but towards the end of our visit I wanted to get a dessert. The item I wanted was sold out so then we just decided to finish our dinner. While our server got our check, he brought me in ice cream on the house! And then he apologized once again that the item I wanted was sold out.   I definitely value the service of Oyshi because they really do try to accommodate to your needs the best they can! I'm overdue for another visit!",

We ordered a half dozen Fresh Oysters, I personally haven't had Oysters that bad ever.  Stay away from them.  We tried the following rolls Fantasy (absolutely horrible,  I think there was hot dog mustard on it), Oyshi (comes with crunch on top), this roll had an inch of crunch on top of the roll.  We had to scrap it off to be able to eat it.  Taste like dry cereal flakes.  We also had J and B (baked salmon) this roll wasn't bad if it was sitting in front of me, I wouldn't personally order it again though.  We also had the Coco, this is basically immiatation crab wrapped in seaweed. I wouldn't call it bad just bland.   The menu clearly states that you must eat all of the food you order if you order All You Can Eat, so we suffered and ate all the rolls we didn't like.  Basically we paid $23 to eat food we didn't care for.  Afterwards we were informed that we could have just left it and not eaten it.  Maybe that should go on the menu right next to the part that says you must all it all or be charged additional for the roll.    Sorry Oyshi not impressed and I feel like we just wasted our sushi moment and $23 a person.",

Recent reviews: -Oyshi used to be good until about late 2017-early 2018 -Quality of food is dangerous (several people including me and my wife got sick (several times) -Service is beyond poor (it's crazy) -Wait time for dishes is extremely unreasonable -Wait time to be seated is even worse",

He was apologetic at the end when some desserts were not available.  Great time, good corner table and constant refills on point.

Nine of us were super excited about a place that advertises as \"All You Can Eat,\" but based on the recommendation, we thought we'd give it a try.   We were completely surprised in a good way.  We ordered 2 of the lunch specials for 3 of us, and although it was plenty, we all wanted more.  We chose a rainbow roll, Hawaiian roll, Alaskan roll, and a spicy tuna roll. It was fresh, tasty, and perfectly prepared.   On another note, the service was incredibly friendly and helpful. The sushi chefs made some recommendations which were spot on. We will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "This place is gross, rude, and unaccommodating...I have been going here for years without any complaints, but over the years this place has gone downhill, specifically with cleanliness. For the last year I have noticed the sushi fridges are never wiped off, counters unclean at the sushi bar, and sub-par cleanliness of the bathrooms.   Currently my partner is pregnant, but has cravings for sushi. While she doesn't eat anything uncooked, she likes to enjoy the atmosphere and savor what she is missing out on (pregnant women will understand this). On multiple occasions the staff has been very accommodating with request for swapping raw fish for cooked fish due to pregnancy. However, on our most recent visit the chef said he as unable to do this. I explained to him that my partner was pregnant, but this had no effect on our request. We then stated that we come in at the same times and have made this request previously without issues. He then proceeded to tell us that this wasn't True, because he always works at this time and that no one would do that.   Not a huge deal, I am just disappointed with the treatment we received. The item in question was a sampler plate with tempura shrimp, salad, and a chef choice of sushi roll, etc etc. What we requested was for the sushi roll to be a cooked item instead i.e. shrimp tempura roll or something of similar preference. The staff wanted us to purchase the item as is and to purchase the cooked item to accompany the plate. Honestly, after years of coming to this place we will be taking our business elsewhere.",

The customer service eas good, but not great. The fish was very good though, and the restaurant didn t smell like fish. I would visit Oyshi again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

The rolls were tasty and never before have I seen so many appetizers that were included with the AYCE option!  The restaurant is inviting, the food is delicious, the options are almost endless, the service is quality, and as an added bonus, there were a ton of good looking women who dined here while I was present (nothing to do with the restaurant but definitely a plus).  As soon as I left I wanted to go back.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't perfect.  Some of the food was just ok and not amazing like the rest.  Items such as the egg rolls, surf and turf plate, and shrimp and asparagus skewers were just alright, nothing to write home about.  That being said, I would instantly come back here.",

    "text": "Came in here for the first time on a Sunday 2pm, off peak lunch hour. There were about 4 other groups eating there with 5 sushi chefs working. Our initial order took quite a while - it did not all come out at once which is understandable, but I've definitely eaten at other places that don't have as many chefs that was much faster.   Anyway, the first round was all nigiri - the first half came out great! Fish was fresh, rice portions under them were very reasonable. When the second half of the nigiri order came out.. The ENTIRE PLATE was drowned in ponzu sauce.. Gross. This is a big no-no, the rice was so drenched in this sauce that it couldn't even be picked up without the rice falling apart. For this I am docking a star.  I then decided to order some of their appetizer fresh oysters (to wash the disgusting ponzu sauce out of my mouth). They came out promptly and we're definitely fresh. They came out with a little bit of a pico de gallo type salsa on them and already had hot sauce on it.  The oysters were very clean and shucked properly - an observation I did have was that the oyster itself was almost tasteless - as in, no Oceany taste - perhaps they were farmed oysters if that's a thing.  (We paid dinner price to get in on these and the uni/sweet shrimp during lunch hour, definitely worth the extra $5pp if you eat these)  Also tried the lobster fair and spider roll - the spider roll was kind of bland and the lobster fair was a California roll with crab salad burnt on top - I would not order either one of those again.   The wife got green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brulee. I sampled both and they were quite delicious.  Service was ok, our waitress must have ended her shift while we were half way through eating but the other servers were all willing to help.  In summary, not a bad AYCE sushi joint - but make sure you tell them to hold that ponzu sauce if it's not your thing.  Also choose your rolls carefully if you order any - I won't order rolls from there anymore but would definitely eat there again.",

It was fresh and delicious, and most important the service was quick! We will definitely return to dine here again.   FYI - Dinner all you can eat  (Sat) was $27 each. We had 3 kids (age 10 and below) and they ordered the chicken teriyaki ala carte and it was okay with the restaurant. Most All you can eat sushi restaurant won't let kids get the ala carte and instead would require to pay the full buffet price so I definitely recommend this Japanese restaurant for kids who are picky eaters",

    "text": "My family is a big fan of sushi. My daughter and I can live on sushi everyday! Oyshi is a wonderful neighborhood sushi restaurant. It's not a very big place, so be prepared to wait for a table, especially at dinner time!  Oyshi is our favorite AYCE restaurant. Lunch is $22, and dinner is $27 for ages 12 and over.  Lunch $16, dinner $19 for under 12. Beverage is not included in the price. Be aware that party of 6 or more an 18% gratuity will be automatically added to the bill.  I almost always order the Miso soup. It's very light on flavor but very comforting to eat. The Fresh Oysters are very fresh, served with refreshing salsa! Only 2 pieces per person in the AYCE dinner only! At lunch they charge dinner price for them. You can order unlimited items from the appetizers. Love their Baked Oysters! Easy to pick from the shells because they are separated and halfway cut. The Shrimp Tempura is lightly covered and not grease, served with dipping sauce. My newest discovery is the Yakitori (2 skewers per order). I love the Shrimp and asparagus! Seriously, I can eat a whole plate of that! My other favorite item is the Japanese Lasagna. I make sure to order it all the time. I believe Oyshi makes them the best! Everyone's favorite is the Monster! Spider roll with shrimp tempura, topped with baked eel and avocado, with eel sauce. Bonsai: spicy tuna roll with Cajun albacore and avocado on top. Sexy: yum-yum scallop, cream cheese and crunch flakes inside, topped with eel tempura, with wasabi mango and eel sauce. My BF really likes the Crunch Scallop: Oyshi scallop, crab mix and avocado with popcorn scallops on top, with wasabi mango and eel sauce.  After eating all these food, I always wonder, how much more a person can eat? Well, we always get dessert, too! My absolute favorite is the Mango Mochi (ice cream wrapped in rice dough). The Green Tiramisu is very tempting, too! I really liked the green tea flavor in it! It's a house made tiramisu cake infused with green tea. My daughter's favorite is the Vanilla or Green tea ice cream.  Service is always very attentive! Our iced tea is always refilled!  Happy to return anytime!",

I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese or eel in my rolls. Oddly, these two items (but mainly the cream cheese) makes it hard for me to find one that sound appealing without modification. It's a large menu but I can never seem to find a roll that sounds 'amazing' as written.   They offer all you can eat which is great for big eaters. We typically order a couple rolls, some baked mussels, a few hot sakes, and mochi. Each time the server has comped off one or more of the smaller items because we were paying the regular prices so it always comes out to about the same cost as if we had done all you can eat.  Service can be spotty but if you're not in a rush it's a nice spot to grub on some sushi basics.",

    "text": "Very disappointed ! We came here with family since my brother highly recommend this place. We were a group of 12 and had to wait because the place is packed on a Saturday night. Almost an hour had passed and they said it will be ready in 10-15 mins. Then came a group of 11 who came and were seated right away. I don't know if they had reservation but we just felt ignored the whole time. So I asked the receptionist that why is it taking too long? And she said that we are a big group blah blah blah. My dad was really upset and confronted the manager and the manager \"Kevin\" said if you continue to complain then the more you are going to wait. That made me really furious because nobody should disrespect anyone no matter what. So I told him to cancel it and the manager said \"Good!\"   I don't know if this manager had restaurant etiquette but even if people had high praise about your food but the service sucks it doesn't make you of a good place! I'm not sure if he owns the place but if there is a bigger boss he should not be working in a restaurant since he doesn't respect the customers and honestly we felt discriminated.   I've never felt so bad like this because it involved my family and it was suppose to be a nice dinner to wrap up our vacation in Vegas. I just hope this would be the last time they are doing this to anyone because it's a waste since my brother said its one of the best in Vegas. And to Kevin the Manager, one of your job Is to respect your customers the food just comes second your service is more important just in case you never knew that !",

Then to be sat at the bar 15 minutes later and all seats are still open. They either do not have enough servers or just poor table management. Whoever owns this restaurant needs to spend more time to see the flow of service and the dissatisfaction of the guests. Our server was very good by the way.",

The party, with the exception of one tactically frugal individual all went All You Can Eat (AYCE).  Two things: 1) The sushi was great. Fresh, well put together, largelly plated well and highly satisfactory. Nothing mind blowing, but great stuff.  2) They brought it out seemingly at random. We'd not get rolls we ordered and get other rolls instead, no explanation. The waitress was reading our requests back and she appeared to be writing them down, but the correlation between food requested and food delivered was .71 tops.  Bizarre Food Fail: Surf and Turf was ordered. Turf and Turf was delivered. Apparently the shrimp staged a daring escape.  I will return here, but largelly because it's five minutes away and my friends have low standards.",

After our visit, I discovered MY NEWFOUND LOVE!! Sushi!!!  Price: 5 stars! Prices were reasonable. We went for their all-you-can-eat that costed about $26/person. I must say, we ate so much I think the store will go bankrupt! Jk.   Service: 5 stars!  Our server was also very nice. He always checked in on us to see if we're doing good. Very polite and quick. It seems like all of the servers there were.  Worth the time and money. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!",

We ordered the tuna poki, garlic albacore, salmon sashimi, and the screaming orgasm. The poki was mediocre but not bad. The salmon was also okay but once again not the best. The screaming orgasm was way over sauced in a creamy mayo sauce. I couldn't even taste the fish, although I do have to say they cut the tuna well. The worst was the albacore. It was bright red and tasted mushy and off. Needless to say we didn't finish it. I have a feeling if I want to find good sushi in this city I'm going to have to head to China Town.",

I gave this place three strikes before I decided I won't come here again. The first time I came with a group of 4 friends. Waitresses were always slow to come to our table to order more sushi leaving us with nothing to eat multiple times. At the end of the day two of us got food poisoning the next day. Second time I came with my girlfriend. Again, waitresses don't check up on our table enough. Third time I came with a group of 8 friends. We waited over 30 minutes for our server to take our second order for ayce. We complained to the manager about our server and it seemed like he didn't care or address our concern. When our server did come we already lost our appetite and just wanted to leave. The food is amazing but the service needs an overhaul.  I'll be return every once in awhile but, previous experiences has kept Oyshi from being my #1 AYCE sushi.",

Only complaints are that club/techno music is always playing and that your clothes tends to smell like smoke. Favorite rolls are the lobster fair, atomic bomb, Kami-kaze, coco, Japanese garlic lasagna, and the Nyi roll. To go ordering is a simply easier way to go to avoid the crowds. Like to end the meal with the ever tasty berry parfait. Customer service is always friendly with a smile.",

Enjoyed them both thoroughly.  My colleagues raved about their selections also.  The sushi chefs were very courteous, and the waitress was quick to assist with questions and recommendations.    I will definitely keep this on my lunch list, and may have to make an evening visit, when you really decide on that last star at a local sushi spot!  \"Kanpai!\"",

Our food arrived quickly at our table (even faster than the times when they were less busy and I sat at the bar), and we were made to feel comfortable by the staff.  Food: Better than ever. All of our rolls were presented with delicacy and tasted great. Even though the place was packed, I felt like the chefs really took the time to prepare the best rolls for us, and yet did not take forever to make our orders.

The only reason I didn't give Oyshi 5 starts is because of the service. Every once in a while you'll find yourself wanting to order sushi for 10 minutes or more because you haven't seen your server. Simple solution for this is to sit at the sushi bar. Nothing I would knock it down to 3 stars for because overall is still great sushi and a good experience!",

I asked to be seated at the bar bc I was alone nd pregnant, so I thought it was good to see how they handle the food beside I expected it to be fun nd fast. I did all u can eat. Waited 30min for my app: gyoza. The chefs never said hi or even looked at my direction with care or happiness. \"I have been always greeted at a bar/sushi bar\", it is the least they can do. One of the chef made a silly comment as soon as I arrived at the bar, after that I knew I was at the wrong place. From 4 different kind of rolls I would only came back for 1 (maniac roll) it was the only one spice with no sweet sauce or fake crabmeat. Everything else was just blah blah blah. The service was polite but slow nd confused. I never had a refill on my water. Their (management/sushi chef) seems like to kiss the good looking/well dressed ppl ass. Everyone else were mistreated including myself. This was the worse place I have ever been. I would never come back here once I won't put my best clothes just to someone treat me with respect. Besides for 1 single good roll??? Forget it. I would prefer to drive to 808 sushi that' is not fancy but better quality sushi and a way better service. . The first roll I had was the monster (every single piece of it fell apart when trying to eat it. every single roll were ugly and tasteless except for the super sweet sauce and super sweet crabmeat combination they put on everything. My experience at this place lasted around 1 1/2hour bc it would take between 25-35 min for every order. Plus 20min for the check.

    "text": "I've never been to a sushi buffet like this before.  Normally, places like Todai, Onami (now Tora in San Diego) have it set up where you walk up to the sushi bar and the rolls are there waiting for you to pick them up, at the same time they have a hot plate station, as well as desserts.  Oyshi is totally different due to the fact that you choose from the menu what you would like from the buffet section and it is made fresh for you to munch on.  Sushi is not the only thing part of the buffet menu, there are the small appetizer sushi's as well as tempura vegetables.  The best part are the specialty rolls, they are so freakin delicious.  I can't remember each of their names, but the cajun specialty roll, and the whatever screaming whatchamacalit are so damn good!  The ambience is pretty stylish and nice and I give them more props for playing house progressive music as we dine.  The staff is uber nice, especially since we went in a massive group that was pretty loud and would have drove most servers bonkers d bobcat.  Definitely gonna want to come here again next time I make a trip back out to visit the family in Vegas.",

    "text": "TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS: Best and freshest sushi place in town!  If you can splurge for all you can eat It Is definitely the way to go!  Super selection-The yellowtail and garlic tuna are amazing!  Fresh everytime  and melts in your mouth.  Top 5  favorite rolls - I think what makes these so good is the eel sauce (slightly sweet):  1) Atomic bomb (kind of a sad name for a japanese roll but I digress) - spicy jalapeno on top and siracha 2) Monster roll - huge but has all the goodies  3) Simply shrimp- light and sweet 4) Red dragon- spicy tuna roll sweet and spicy yum! 5) Tiger roll - similar to red dragon buy with shrimp tempura added  Just tried their hand roll last night - They have a killer shrimp and avocado one. Not on the menu but they'll make it for you.   Appetizers: Seaweed salad Excellent tempura-always fresh and hot never oily Surf and turf-steak and shrimp appetizer. One order enough for two people to share  Desserts (all you can eat is one dessert per person) Mochi of course!! Yogurt parfait is big, especially after a large meal, but very tasty  Some negatives:  Oyshi can get really busy.  They do take reservations and have two private rooms available.  Also, not a big fan of the \"baked sushi\" although the california crunchy roll is pretty good if you like baked.  All in all, this is my favorite sushi place in town and really hard to beat.  This place is a \"must\" for any yelper!",

The fish is very fresh and flavorful, except the oysters, which I thought were a little bland.  Lately we've had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, so this place is definitely gaining in popularity.  The menu has changed somewhat in the past year and now they have more appetizers and dessert, which is definitely a plus!  However you can only order one of the special desserts but you can have all the ice cream you want.  The rolls are solid and the uni has been fresh every time we've visited.",

I've came here for a dinner date with my BF, to enjoy company of good friends, to celebrate birthdays and even left family stories here. What I mean to say is that.. This place is good for any occasion and anyone.  Of course they have ALLYOUCANEAT at 20sum dollars. Just ordering more than two dishes is already worth that 20sum. Different rice bowls (suchas unagi), surf&turf, baked mussles, desserts and so much more are included in your 20sum dollars. If there's anything specific I'm looking for in a sushi spot.. It would be Cajun Albacore & Tempura fried ice cream. This place doesn't have temp. ice cream, but they do have the best Cajun Albacore. The flavor is mouth watering! And you can't even see the rice with this huge savory slice over it. I eat these like chips!  The service here is pretty friendly, especially if you sit at the bar. I mean what's better than interacting with the chef making your food?! This place has three private rooms for group parties. One of them is a lounge with individual sofa chairs and a big LCD TV.",

They were already on round 3 and we were still on round 1!!! Wth.   The Uni was not good... looked old and dark. Fresh uni is supposed to be light yellow/orange color but this was DARK orange/brown.

The decor was gorgeous and modern and for $21 dollars for all you can eat sushi plus sweets!   Went here on the weekend and there was a good amount of people dining. The sushi was good and I even tasted some sushi that I wouldn't normally try back home. Because of the \"all you can eat deal\", I took advantage of that. As we ordered it took a bout a couple of minutes for our food to come out.   I gave this place 3 stars because our waitress Vivian had forgotten some of our food. The food was good and I wanted to try as much as I could, I got too excited.. but when you forget an order, it bums customers out. She did apologize.   I would like to come back again and try more of the food here, just hopefully they wont forget our order :)",

This is quite common with AYCE places, but there are a few places out there that load the fish and use an appropriate/smaller amount of rice.

So sushi pretty delish.   But honestly the service there is beyond poopy because.. Sure went on a Sunday, did not wait for a seat but I did wait just to order a glass of water just about 15 minutes.. Just to order that damn water.. And behind me was a wife and kid and the server finally asked are you waiting for something? And she responded. \"yes my sushi, I've been waiting for 20 minutes\"  Yeah... Keep that in mind and enjoy!",

Some of the sushi have options of preparing. ie. you can have your albacore regular, seared, seared with garlic, etc. Same goes for the salmon and yellowtail and a few other fish on the menu.

When I get sushi, I rarely get anything baked. Which makes sense if you're doing AYCE. You don't want to get filled up quick. I had the AYCE but I was craving for nigiris. Got my usual salmon, tuna, albacore, yellow tail and cajun albacore. OMG, I tried picking up the nigiri, and rice literally just fell out. and the fish was too thick and kinda rubbery. Yuck.  Service was alright, the waiter checked on us couple times like how they should. I was told that their service was the worst, but in this case, it's the fish.   I would come back, actually I wouldn't. Wait, I would if I got appetizers only not nigiris.",

I ordered a few different nigiri: salmon, halibut, red snapper, yellowtail, and scallops.  First of all, the fish to rice ratio was 1:1.5.  I am not sure how most people like their sushi, but I tend to I like my sushi a little more meaty and less rice-y.  Everyone has their own opinion on this, which I understand.  The salmon was alright, but I didn't get the \"melt-in-your-mouth\" sensation.  I'm not sure if I came on an \"off\" night, or if the fish just wasn't fresh this time.  I guess I expected more for a nice-looking restaurant, but I will definitely try it again next time I am in the area.",

The only reason for 2 stars is good service from the waiter, and good green tea ice cream.  Sometimes the ice cream can be a turnoff too, but not here.  The fish was horribly fishy and tasted old.  I grew up on an island and know fish pretty well...this fish thumbs down.  I had tuna, salmon, octopus, albacore, and the treasure.  I had to choke it down.  Under normal circumstances, I would have 3-4 rolls, and about 10 orders of nigiri, with sides of apps.  When I arrived, I was not greeted by any staff, but was looked at by about 5 of them.  I was standing right by the \"Wait to be seated\" sign, and nothing.  Nothing from even the sushi chefs (who also looked right at me.)  I even had 2 staff walk in right pass me coming to work I guess.  I am told that they have another restaurant on Sahara/Tenaya.  Well sorry to say, I will not be going to either one.  If you are in the area and need sushi, go to 808 Sushi or SOHO.  Better food and better prices.",

Although I have not been here in months because I moved on the opposite end of Vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(  WHERE: Located on Rainbow & Robindale  WHAT:  Everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! From the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!  If you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, I suggest AYCE all the way!! Lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!  One of my favorite appetizers is the ahi poke! There's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!  ROLLS: -Oyshi roll: The first thing you should try! It is their special roll, and the absolute best!! -Vegas & Sibuya rolls: If I can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor! -Japanese Lasagna roll: I always have to have my baked roll!!  There are other great rolls, but I can't remember what the names were! So, until next time! I will update soon!  *NOTE: You also get a free dessert with AYCE!! There are the fruit&yogurt parfait, creme brulee, ice cream, or mochi!",

    "text": "The best sushi place in Vegas, and it's all-you-can eat.  It's been theorized by our mother that my brother and I have tapeworms with the amount of food we devour on a daily basis. With the amount of sushi we ate tonight, this could be True. Lunch is cheaper at $21 per person but I'm sure there are less things to order. We came for the all-you-can eat dinner ($26 per person) and ordered:  - yellowtail - salmon - tuna - mackerel - uni (sea urchin) - oysters (limit 4 per person) - red rock roll - dynamite roll - favorite roll - and like, six other rolls.  The bottom line is that all the fish is fresh, the service is prompt and friendly, but the food can take a while to come out when they're busy (especially since it's an all you can eat place and there's a ton of things to make) so after your first order comes, order again immediately before you finish to insure it gets there on time.   There is a 2 hour limit for the all you can eat option but I didn't have any issues with it. Most sushi places have this rule as a safety cushion for those rude customers who don't know any better and camp out in the restaurant for hours as if it were their last meal.  The decor is industrial Asian with exposed pipes, bricks, dim lighting, and colorful murals. It's a snazzy place in an unassuming location, but I'd totally take a date here.  With tip and tax, it came out to around $65 for two and that's including drinks and after devouring half the Pacific Ocean. We will be back with the whole family.",

Trust me, Goymon or I love sushi has WAY BETTER SUSHI. so the night went like this...... I had guests all the way from KOREA. they are the ones who saw the review of this place and told me they want to go. I told them they are not that great (since I have been here several times) but regardless to my opinion, we went. We waited for 30 mins to be seated which is not a big deal. I understand sushi restaurants get busy for dinners.... We sat down and ordered a few nigiris.... THEY brounght 4 pcs every 20 minutes. Once again, I have been to other sushi restaurants and I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT NO MATTER HOW BUSY THE RESTURANT IS, nigiri never takes that long.. so as a result, within an hour... we ate 6 pcs between 3 people. I asked for a manager and told them the situation, and he said THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO. (NOT EVEN SORRY) so we said we want to leave and THEY CHARGED US FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF 3ppl's ALL YOU CAN EAT. I am telling you right now, if you want to ruin our dinner with AWFUL FOOD and IRRESPONSIBLE and RUDE staffs, this is the place to be. NEVER EVER AGAIN. THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER.",

It took forever to refill waters and order more food. The staff was very standoffish and everyone from the management to servers to the sushi chefs looked miserable to be working there. I didn't like the atmosphere for an afternoon they were playing party music. Their quality of fish was low and didn't seem fresh. I was very disappointed with this place considering all of the reviews. I have to drive a little bit father for an AYCE sushi place now but it is well worth it, so everyone go to Sushi Koma instead!!

Service at Oyshi is very friendly. The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and the art of sushi. They are always willing to suggest and prepare something new for you to try.

At this point we offered to sit at the bar  which only had more than 10 avail seats, and we were told the issue was the staff was backed up and we could not be seated there either. We waited approx 20 min before we were sat at a table that had more soy sauce on the menus than were in the soy sauce pots. We placed our order, half our party received their rolls within an acceptable 15 min (We took a soy sauce pot from another table that had been empty the entire time and that one was also empty) while the other half did not receive anything until 45 min had gone by and the other half of the table had eaten their entire order. After 1 hour the person next me and I had received 2 of the 3 rolls we initially ordered and we canceled the remaining order. The server took off our drinks and did not charge us the remaining rolls even though one of the elusive rolls showed up the min we tried to leave. Food was good/average for a sushi place in this price bracket waiter was prompt and courteous. The one star is for the food and the waiter otherwise I would select none.  Restaurant was just poorly staffed/operated. One last thing the was the restroom looked like it was hit by hurricane Sandy and the host really did not seem to care about anything. Who understaffs a restaurant on a Saturday night?",

Although the food is great, service is baddd. I'm pretty sure our server forgot the entire entree for my friend, as his food didn't come out until we were very much done with ours, and the rolls were not very difficult to make. Some servers took their sweet time just walking around the place with an FML look on their face. Overall, the food was great which keeps me coming back, but I definitely have to tolerate the service.",

    "text": "LATE NIGHT SUSHI AT ITS BEST (At least, from what I've tried so far)  I usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in Vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. Not Oyshi! Thankfully, this place stays open until 2AM (last call at 1:30 AM) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in Vegas.  The All-You-Can-Eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! Though not as great as other AYCE places I have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food.   I think my favorite roll was the Yellowstone Roll, which was an interesting Spicy Tune and Whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and CHEDDAR CHEESE. I haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.  I do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because I would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.  The alcohol did seem relatively expensive. My buddy had a Sapporo and it was $7 or $8. That almost seems obscene.  On a positive note, Dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the Teriyaki Chicken Dinner. For $11, hhe had a Miso Soup, a Salad, a bowl of white rice and a HUGE steaming hot plate FULL of chicken teriyaki with hardly any vegetables. It was a fantastic deal!",

I suggest sticking to the nigiri rolls, or the traditional sushi rolls. None of that spicy tuna stuff, or anything with cheese in it. Traditional is the way to go. We ordered two rolls that were non-traditional, and we found that to be a very bad idea. On the other hand, tuna and salmon were not fresh the day we went (salmon was more fresh, but still...). It worried me.   My favorite thing on the menu that night were the ama ebi (sweet raw shrimp). They were probably one of the freshest items on the menu. For this alone, they get another star because it was unique. I've never had this before at another restaurant.  Why did no one listen to me when I suggested Kyara for Japanese tapas instead?",

Granted its a different type of restaurant but still, its money well spent if you spend $ 50 for two in soyo than here.  The reason why I am so harsh on this place. Well, sushi are just amazingly stupid. There is no artform whatsoever, sushi are art, even though you are an ayce restaurant. Its a reflection of the sushi chef how the presentation of the sushi went.   This restaurant make all sushi look like california roll and to boot if you look at all the rolls it full of slimy crabmeat with mayonaisse combination to make you full right away.   Sure, they do have other appetisers on the menu or dessert included, but there are lots of other japanese ayce around las vegas that offer the same things.   All this yelper that commented how great this restaurant is must never really eat in a proper japanese restaurant. Service are ok but honestly this one is a one and done for me.  You can try and then pm me afterward, I will probably just say \"see I told you so\"",

And my dessert of choice is the green tea tiramisu. Yum! Though the parfait is a close second.  The AYCE price is the same as most places. The items were good, but nothing too special. Service is kinda poor. Maybe because I am usually here with a larger party so we are usually in one of the private rooms. I must say though, the room on the left with the couches is nice, but not ideal for a dining area...  Not a bad sushi place food wise, but service could use improvement. But really nothing special about this place, I don't get why so many people love it here... And I AM a sushi LOVER... well.. a food lover in general. :)",

The cuts of fish were smaller than I am used to. So taking portion size into account, the a la carte pricing is fair. Which leads to this point: I think that part of the draw of this place is that they have an \"AYCE\" (All-You-Can-Eat) menu. The AYCE price is equivalent to what I paid for my a la carte meal (as described below).  As for my experience, I ordered: miso soup with clams; a California roll; tuna sushi, salmon sushi, Cajun tuna sushi, and halibut sushi. These are standard items, and I felt it would provide me with good gauge of the quality of their fish. The quality of the fish was very good.  Would I go again? Sure. But I would go for the AYCE.  BTW... the kitchen closes at 1:30am most nights (check the site for operating hours). Not bad for the suburbs.",

Some will say that service of the sushi is a tad slow but hey you get two hours. Who likes to be rushed when eating anyways? I enjoy food so I would like to enjoy it at a nice pace thank you. If your with great company that gives some extra time for some intellectual exchange of words (conversation). Plus the two hours give enough time to let the rice settle a bit and enough time to try a good portion of the menu.  The service might be a tad slow but the workers are always pleasant. I actually feel like I'm wanted there.. not like that other Asian restaurants.. They also are very knowledgeable with the menu which leads to great sushi suggestions.  The sushi at Oyshi I say is the best I've had in Las Vegas!  I would like to suggest the RED ROCK ROLL due to the fact that it contains \"Orgasm Sauce.\"  The sauce is rightfully named this because it will climax your taste buds into ecstasy!  Conclusion.. YES!",

If there's an AYCE option at a sushi restaurant, I always order it because the price equals 2-3 specialty rolls. It just doesn't make sense any other way. Besides specialty rolls, I like hand rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) and certain appetizers depending on my mood. I wasn't impressed with their hand rolls and although their specialty rolls are good, they're not amazing either (I've had better counterparts at other AYCE restaurants). I really like their DOUBLE SCREAMING ROLL (without cream cheese) because the special sauce makes it unique. Their desserts are really good too. I like that they offer a PARFAIT that features ice cream, fresh assorted berries, and granola. Very good. On my most recent trip, I found out I could get Green Tea ice cream rather than Vanilla and it was even more amazing. The service is good and the food is usually quick. The only thing I really hate is the restaurant's lack of appropriate venting, so you end up leaving the place smelling like the inside of a fryer.",

    "text": "Why three stars? Here's why.... First let me say that for a not so busy Saturday afternoon it took fifteen minutes for me and my boyfriend to be seated. It took another fifteen minutes on top of that for the waitress to take our order and another twenty minutes for us to get our sushi. I have heard of oyshi being one of the best sushi places in town, and while the sushi is good and tasty, in order for a restaurant (in my opinion) to have five worthy deserving stars the service needs to be as good as the food. That's minus star number one.   And!.... You would think for an 'all you can eat' everything in the all you can eat section is all you can eat, right? Including the dessert? Well, I think not (not here at oyshi at least.) The dessert here is one per person only. Which technically isn't all you can eat. So it's basically all you can eat sushi, but not dessert. Haha. That would minus star number two.   Now, on to the three yummy stars! When the sushi finally came, it was yum-O! With a capital last letter screaming O! The cajun albacore (thanks to a friend who recommended it at another sushi place) has become one of my favorites next to unagi. It's really full of flavor and I love how the center of attention goes to the fish, not the rice at the bottom. That gives plus one star.  The atmosphere in this restaurant is laid back. Both my boyfriend and I are laid back so the mood of the place set the mood for a relaxing time which is always much needed after a long busy week. Even their cutesy plate mats had designs of cutesy fonts and cutesy flowers. Haha. Guess what? Yes! You guessed it, another star for oyshi.  Freshness in sushi is another thing I look for. And boy oh boy does oyshi serve it fresh. As fresh as the prince of bel-air. We had the 'love affair' which everyone kept yelping about. It's the kind of affair that makes you feel guilty because you think you are cheating on your significant other. Oh yea, it's that's good! Total of three stars for this modern looking sushi spot.  I don't know if I'd come back though partly because of the service and partly because of my ever so longing for eating a lot of desserts. Well, I wouldn't say I don't know but maybe. Maybe the service is better than what we experienced in a different time or day. Maybe. A-ok review by me, but read other peoples reviews of this place. You may have a change of heart unlike me. =P",

I'll start off by saying I read a few reviews below and have to agree with something many have said and that is that you tend to have to wait a bit to get your orders in and then get served due to how busy the place is. My advice come early or come late ;) there open until 2 am Fridays and Saturdays.  We both got the AYCE deal; I think the bill came out to $64 for that and the two cokes. The sushi was fresh and very flavorful. The sauces were amazing. We had the simply shrimp roll (my favorite of the night), a deep fried spicy tuna roll and a few others. I tried something new for me and that was a tuna roll with scallions, which was a more fatty part of the tuna, more subtle and slightly fishier flavor that she did not enjoy, but I did. We finished off with a roll that had garlic sauce and wow that was seriously garlic flavored, so if you are not that into garlic, stay away from anything with garlic sauce. lol  The wait staff was nice, but again it was so busy they were all over the place and we tended to wait longer then I feel we or the other customers should have.  The place was ok and worth checking out if, you are in the area, but if you live across town like me it may not be worth the trip.",

I normally come here with my cousins when we feel like sushi and in the past the sushi has always been top notch.  But tonight, I think the chef was probably in a bad mood, hence the mediocre sushi.   I also ordered a sashimi salad.  It's also not so great here.  I've had it better in other restaurants.

    "text": "We tried Oyshi on a recommendation from a Renoite transplant that lives in Vegas now, we were expecting decent ayce sushi, much like the ones you can get in Reno....not even close.    Sushi- The sushi is just, ok.  The fish wasn't super fresh, some of the cuts of fish were thin and cut poorly, falling apart.  Most of the rolls had the same notes of lots of imitation crab meat mixture, so they all tasted the same.    Appetizers- I'm a fanatic for raw oysters, they had small Pacific oysters that were a bit on the warm side and very bland tasting, flavorless even with the siracha sauce they dotted on it.  It tasted as though it was about to go bad and they rinsed it with tap water, even the shell the oyster was served in lacked oyster liquor, which isn't a good sign.  Needless to say, I was only able to eat 1 of 4 that I ordered and it was a struggle to keep it down.  I've eaten raw oysters from a jar and the raw oysters here came pretty close to that.  I told the wait staff that the oysters were a bit off and she replied, \"that's odd they're usually not like that\".  The manager was attentive and came to our table to see if we wanted more oysters, stating that there wasn't enough sauce on our previous order as to why they tasted that way. If the oysters are fresh, why would you need to drown it in \"sauce\"?  The sweet shrimp with side of fried heads, amaebi, were not so sweet, which means they weren't so fresh.  The shrimp heads weren't prepared properly, (not fried well) and so it was tough to bite through it.  After having the oyster and amaebi, we passed on the uni, because if you can't get the other 2 right, there's no way we were going to try the uni as it needs to be super fresh.  They were pretty busy for a Tuesday night, so maybe I just have high expectations for sushi, or maybe we just got the Sushi chef in training, but if your like me and your jonesing for some great sushi, this place isn't for you.",

It also comes with California rolls, fried vegetables, salad (I don't care for, I substitute it for white rice) AND miso soup. Way more than I can eat but I try! They also have jalapeno poppers, which are not your ordinary jalapeno poppers. They are my FAV. I could eat them everyday, all day. Also, fav sushi rolls-- spicy tuna crunch, love affair, full moon. They are all spectacular. Their ice cream parfait dessert is also fantastic. All you can eat is great but doesn't include jalapeno poppers so I don't usually get it unless I'm in the mood for a big variety. I also love their egg rolls. Before I came here I HATED sushi! And seafood. Now I LOVE sushi, mainly only there's. basically everything is amazing here. I don't like how loud the music is, but if you ask they'll turn it down. Waiters are nice & atmosphere is very japanese (which I LOVE, love Japan & their culture!)",

Anyway, did the AYCE again, but I ordered the Kami Kaze and NYI rolls. Word of warning, these things were HUGE. I thought the AYCE portions suppose to be smaller than the regular order. If this is smaller order, I'm afraid to ask what their regular size would be. These two rolls came out near the end of our meals and we were kinda full by that time already, so trying to stuff those two rolls down was a challenge. Next time, I won't order this roll unless I have 2 or 3 people to split it with. Anyway, the reason I reduced one star on this trip is that the sushi wasn't as fresh as my previous trip there. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional fresh either. I heard from some review, not sure if it's for Oyshi or Kobe, that it might be due to the fact that fish delivery comes on Tue, Thu and Sat.",

The plate of eight pieces was disinagrated in 3.7 seconds and I have to tell ya, the rest of the meal was outstanding.      Each order preceding was nicely sized, fresh, served  promptly (we sat at a table) and was accompanied by some old school trance...Perfect for folks who enjoy a little EDM with Oyshi's damn good raw Oysters.  All said, a very well priced ($26 per person) fresh and welcoming all you can eat joint that we plan to revisit in the near future.",

Although not totally family friendly, its a relaxed enough atmosphere that you could totally bring the kiddos.  The bathroom although small was neat & clean.  My one note is in regards to service.  The staff wasn't especially friendly nor were they cold.  A smile here or there definitely would earn another star.  That being said, a must for sushi lovers especially with the wide variety of choices on the AYCE menu.  I would definitely eat here again.",

I brought them to his store after dinner and left he texted me to ask what they were cause it was not what he ordered. We called oyshi manager Kevin and he told us he would take care of us next time. So a few days later (visit 3 in less then 10 days) we went again. This time my friend who intro the place made it. When we were done we asked for Kevin again the five of us ate ayces. My two boys both under 3 did not eat. Again we were in VIP room.  Kevin came up and we reminded him of our wrong roll order and the 22 buck credit we had. He said what rolls would you like to take home? We said none the guy we ordered them for is here and we ate enough fish tonight. He said well I'm not taking off check next time you do want rolls to go I will take care of you. Then the check came 18% gratuity for 5 people....... We paid it cause it was 24 dollars but the server actually screwed himself out of a bigger tip.  The service also sucked.. Hour for our first round of rolls to show to the table. It's fresh it's good. It will be closed soon if their attitudes don't change.",

When I called to tell them something was wrong they might want to not serve that roll and its ingredients I was told a manager would call me back I then called the next night and said I wanted my money back I was heated from no manager contacting me which by the way the money was taken out of my account and not refunded. The girl on the phone went back and forth with the manager it pisses me off you're a manager GET ON THE PHONE AND HANDLE THE SITUATION!!!!! I shouldn't have to demand to speak to a manger!! Food poisoning isn't to be taken lightly and I absolutely feel like they don't care. Please be careful eating here it's not worth getting sick!

I have only had the all-you-can-eat here, so my 4-star rating is based on quality for an AYCE setting.   Of all the AYCE places I've been to, Oyshi is definitely the best. Their variety of rolls, sushi, and appetizers is the largest. The fish is fresh and the appetizers are quite creative. I highly recommend the Red Rock Roll and Screaming Roll. For appetizers, the Ahi Poke and Agedashi Tofu is always very good. A welcomed difference from many other AYCE sushi places is that Oyshi is a very nice restaurant. It was built to be a sushi restaurant and has the ambiance of one.   Ever since I found Oyshi a few years ago, I have not gone anywhere else in town for AYCE sushi. However, it has really caught on and their business seems to be booming, especially during the peak hours. Because of that, the last couple of time I've gone there, the service has been very, very slow. I actually tried a new place recently, because I didn't want to be there for 2+hours. Outside of that, it's definitely the best AYCE place in town.",

Service was impeccable and the lunch price at $21 is totally worth it. My nephew ate for $14 AYCE. This is definitely one of my fave AYCE places in town!",

I don't eat sushi but I absolutely love their house salad OMG the dressing is bomb! It started out Ricky when we first went we always had a waiter that I felt could be a tad rude then we started having Pink whom is real nice but then we met Od!! Od is AMAZING!! Best server we have to ever had--anywhere! She is such a sweet girl and ALWAYS remembers us! She knows us by name and has my difficult order memorized! She even knows the different rolls my husband likes which is crazy bc there are so many! We will be moving to the other side of town soon and the worst part about it is we will be far away from this location. My husband said we will drive way over here just to see Od!!! We love you Od!! Thank you for your awesome service and friendly conversation!! It feels like we are visiting a friend sometimes we want her to pull up a chair and eat with us lol. See you soon!!!",

Well first of all, you gotta come early! You can't just be walkin in like you own the place. If it's busy don't expect to be waited on hand a foot. C'mon give these guys a break! They do their best to accommodate the guest they have. I mean, would you be able to handle 6-8 parties yourself? (Unless you're and server than ok. Haha) But nonetheless, they continuously checked up on us and I think that's all we can ask for.   I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. Besides the outstanding service, if you love sushi, Just come here. It's sooo good and During lunch too cause it's cheaper! Hahah Enjoy!",

    "text": "This place is close to my parents' place in Vegas.  I came here with my mom around dinner on a Monday.  Not very crowded.  We ordered the AYCE.  The quality of fish is decent, they don't give you a lot of rice on the sushi which is good because that is a total filler when it comes to AYCE sushi.  The price is pretty good, its under $30/person for dinner.  The service here was good, they check-in on us often, but were not overbearing.  The only thing that sucked was at the tables, they don't offer the half rolls.  It's only available at the sushi bar.  So, if you want half rolls, request to sit at the sushi bar.  There wasn't anything that really stood out.  They have specials written on the chalk board in the front.  When we were there, they had a pork belly appetizer, which tasty good.  Nice and fatty, but it was a little chewy for my taste.  This is good for the local area.  You don't have to wait as long as one that is closer to the Strip, but if I'm in this area and crave sushi, this is a good spot to go to.",

    "text": "Say what?! AYCE for $26?! Yes sir it's worth your whole $26, or if you're going for lunch, it's only $21 but you don't get oysters and who doesn't love oysters?! They have a vast selection of sushi rolls, some of my favorites are the Oyshi Roll which is a baked roll with dynamite topping, spicy tuna crunch, and the atomic roll. But the one thing that is worth every penny is their super white tuna. Have you had super white tuna?! No?! Well, get your butt over here and try it! It melts in your mouth like butter, it's the champagne of fish.. Yes, ahh thinking about it just makes my mouth drool, they top it off with ponzu sauce and it couldn't get any better than that.  Their appetizer list is ongoing and you have so many choices, that's what I like about their AYCE, you have many options to choose from. The calamari is nice and crispy on the outside and a little chewy when you bite into it. The surf and turf is awesome and they just have new meats to pick from that come in a griddle plate (is that what it's called?) it comes steaming hot and on a bed of cabbage and onions YUMMMM! They have a good ahi poke bowl that comes with cucumber slices and seaweed salad underneath, amazing. I could go on, but you really just have to get your butt over there and try it for yourself! Oh yeah, did I mention the desserts? Oh, I haven't.. Well I love their vanilla parfait! They also have creme brulee, green tea tiramisu, and green tea and vanilla ice cream. Oh goodness, I'm hungry.",

She also comes back to explain the dishes to us after somebody else serves it; we liked that. Just me and my boyfriend. With green tea and AYCE, bill came up to $58, without the tip.   We had: POKE SALAD - 3/5 - Maybe I should've eaten the fish with the rest of the salad because I ate all the fish first. My bad! Fish was so fresh.  SEAWEED SALAD - 4/5 - Pretty good.  OYSTERS - 3.5/5 - Pretty good.  TIGER ROLL - 4/5 - I liked this one, but my boyfriend said it's just alright.  MONSTER ROLL - 4.5/5 - We both liked this one.  SHRIMP SKEWERS - 5/5 - Great. I like the sauce, and the shrimp is delish! ASPARAGUS - 2.75/5 - My boyfriend said he didn't like meat wrapped around it. Ironically, that's the only thing I liked about it.  SURF AND TURF SIZZLING PLATE - 3.75/5 - I like the shrimp, but the beef was just alright.  UNI - 4.5/5 - First time having Uni. It was delicious! We would've ordered more if we weren't getting full already.  LOVE AFFAIR ROLL - 4.75/5 - We both loved this one. But my boyfriend later complained it was sweet, which I completely didn't understand because I didn't think it was sweet.  GREEN TIRAMISU - 5/5 - I like that it's not too sweet. It's perfect ending to your meal. It melts in your mouth. We love this one.  CREME BRULEE - 5/5 - We also love this one. The server said they got reviewed as having the best creme brulee in the city. It was really good. The glaze is delish, but it's also delish without the glaze.   We'll be back!!!!",

I came with a party of 9, and our server was so attentive and accommodating that he came by our table a number of times to make sure if everything was ok or if we needed more food; even the host came by to check up on us, now that's good service.   Not only that but the food came out extra fast, usually at the AYCE sushi spots that I go to in the LA/OC area the food kinda lags, maybe because they want you to get full and not order more? Just an assumption :P  All the items that came out were good quality food:   - Oysters (limit one order (4 pieces) per person during dinner only) - Appetizers - Sushi - Hand Rolls - Speciality Rolls - Dessert (limit one per person)  And the selection is pretty extensive! And if you're a roll person, then you're in luck because the rolls are pretty small so that means you get to have more variety by ordering other different rolls.",

The Asian Skirt Steak is wonderful. The Chicken Yakitori is also on my favorites list. As far as sushi rolls are concerned, I've always ordered the Crunch Shrimp Tempura roll.

When the guy on the phone answered he put me on hold and decided at least 10 minutes of my time deserves to be wasted. I hung up and called again he answered and when I asked if he fixed my order so they don't make extra he said he was \"very busy\" and hung up on me. I called yet again this time to cancel my order where I was hung up on AGAIN. By this time I'm clearly upset I called and this time a woman answered she said no manager was on duty and that she was going to give my number to the manager. NO ONE reached out or called. I will not do business where it is not appreciated. The management obviously doesn't care how their staff take care of regulars and the staff has no manners. I've put up with mistakes here and there and never complained but the level of disrespect this last time will not be forgiven.   Any other location will be better if you enjoy this place.",

I often place to go orders and on one particular night as always, I ordered sushi to go and waited..... There were 4 servers standing around chit chatting behind a \"wall\" which was merely a beaded divider. They cussed and spoke rudely about guests in earshot of guests, like myself. I work service industry and understand that on occasions you get rude and sometime intolerable guests and need to vent but speaking poorly about a guest or anything else on your restaurant floor is immature, unprofessional and rude at best.   You're open late, have great food and are quick with service..... I suggest your team be properly coached on the importance of guest relations and the impact one sentence may have on guests in the building.",

    "text": "Were I come from, all you can eat sushi means buffet, which also means stay away. So when Khatherine T. and I made a sushi date and she suggested AYCE, I about died. Thankfully, Oyshi Sushi has opened my eyes to the other side of AYCE.  Even though this was my first real experience with AYCE, I still ordered off the menu, LOL! Should have and would have tried it, but the BF begged me to bring him left overs, the AYCE rules require you to finish eating everything you order. Nuts! Next time the BF can get his own sushi, I'm going big or going home!  Our server was so nice! He made several recommendations of really good rolls, I like mine spicy and he knew which were hot and which were too hot. He even told me one roll to stay away from. He was attentive and made sure we always had food in front of us and our water glasses stayed full. Khatherine was a pro at this, she didn't even have to look at the menu, she knew everything she wanted and ordered each time he came back to the table. She knew how to keep the sushi coming, and everything that came to the table looked delicious!  The sushi was good, not amazing, but good. I tried the Monster Roll (it was so big I had a hard time fitting it in my mouth!), the Rainbow Roll (by BF's request), and the Red Dragon. The Red Dragon was by far my favorite!! My order actually ended up being more expensive than the AYCE, but at least I could bring leftovers home. Now I need to plan date night with the Beau so that we can come back and try the AYCE together.",

We had 2 waiters Johnny and some other guy with Gage's who were careless servers and no one here had a good positive vibe. It took an hour for a miso soup a seaweed salad and 4 rolls to come out when it wasn't even busy. We complained than we got our check which said the drinks were voided which was nice but than she reprinted another which voided $6 instead of $3 big whoop...Don't go here I don't recommend it!",

Brought the check to us- Sat it on the table and then said \"do u want dessert?\" I would think that after knocking water all over the table, which resulted in water all over my husbands pants. He would of been sincere about his apology. Maybe even offered a free mochi?  Prior to that, I had to ask THREE times for napkins while we were eating. Previous expierence there has been great!

    "text": "I used to live in Green Valley and there was a great AYCE place on GVP and Pebble. It's closed now. I found that out the hard way many many moons ago. We used that place as a crutch and were afraid to try a new place (for fear it would not live up to the old place standards).   I had passed Oyshi many times running errands and after driving back to the Southwest area of town, broken hearted about the closure of our \"comfort zone\" sushi venue, we decided to go to Oyshi and give it a try.   I am happy to report that we were very satisfied and have been back MANY times.   Recommendations  1. Do the AYCE. We've calculated MANY times what our meal would have cost with out AYCE and we always come up winners.  2. Don't go on Friday or Saturday nights if you are starving and just can't wait. It's busy, and that should say quite a bit about the quality. I don't mind the crowd or the wait, but sometimes my stomach wishes we had gotten there a little earlier.   Likes  1. House music in the background  2. TVs behind the sushi bar for the sports fans.  3. Ample bar seating - we ALWAYS sit at the bar 4. Extensive menu 5. Chef willing to let you make up your own rolls :)  We try to hit up Oyshi once a month or more if the Sushi cravings are just to hard to resist. I highly recommend. Yum (salivating as I write this)",

They changed the channel for the olympics for us :) - Get the oysters. small but packed with flavor. beware! rocks with the oysters? too fresh :/. LOL - Calamari was a bit too oily. no flavor - Get the baked green mussels. they even cut it in half for you :) - big pieces of yellow tail and salmon for the nigiri :) - The monster roll is deceiving. it's not all soft shell crab. sad that they only use the legs. Ends are shrimp tempura.   - LOVED the salmon skin roll. more skin than salmon means more crunchy :) - the NYI roll barely has soft shell crab. even smaller legs!!! :( - Nuclear roll had a bit too much cream cheese. :/ - Yellow tail trio was a bit too tangy. small pieces of yellow tail - you only get ONE DESSERT! FAIL... - Mango mochi was average. they put a toothpick in it with the plastic on. LOL - Parfait was delicious. but needs more granola. i think the berries and strawberry pieces are frozen. - Although it may sound picky, overall it was pretty delicious or OISHI :)",

So much variety and the service and staff is super quick and super friendly.  Then comes the desert, the deserts are awesome from green tea ice cream, to the mochi ice cream and some kind of berry ice cream cup, totally delicious.  The restaurant is easy to find and theres alot of free parking. You can also order individual rolls but i do suggest just doing the all you can eat buffet if you want to try a variety of the tasty items on the menu. They do serve alcohol as well and what better way to enjoy sushi then with some sake bombs and great friends! Definitely a place im bringing my friends from hawaii when they come to visit.",

    "text": "My rating is bias on the food, that is why I gave 3 stars.  My friends and I originally game to that side of town for Goyemon, the wait was 1.5 hour, so we decided to head down to Oyshi to check out.  All the rolls were mediocre, nothing too special to make me crave to return to that specific location anytime soon.  A couple of stuff they could lay off the yum yum sauce, Kami-Kaze had so much yum yum it looked like pasta sheets as garnish lol.  The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri sushi was really good.  Service was another story.  We waited around 45 mins or more for our first round to come out....even the oyster apps.  Go figure why thier AYCE time limit is 2hrs, not the usually 1hr.  Our server wasn't the greatest, but she did follow up on us when she could.  I noticed she was busing several tables, which is probably why she never followed up with the food and why she was tired.  I have done that, so I know the feeling.  the facility needs to either have the host bus, or have someone to.",

    "text": "been here several times. 1st time was for my 24th birthday. they dont take reservations, which was hard to plan out with 18+ people, but they were able to accommodate all of us, and the people who trickled in late. for the amount of people we had, the service was great! they even gave me a small bottle of hot sake on the house for waiting :]  the foods always been consistent every time i've come back. im not too big on the rolls (although there are a few i like). i get my fill on the hot items and appetizer items. they've added salad bowls and rice bowls as well.  favorites: poke, seaweed salad, oysters (dinner only), ribeye (its not a complete meal if i dont order at least 5 orders for myself), hamachi, salmon, and a few others.   i only rated a 4 because service is never consistent. we sat at the bar one night, and had excellent service from our server (again, the name escapes me. i should really write these down!). another time, a group of maybe 9 or 10 of us went in for lunch, and if i remember right they were short handed at the sushi bar. hot food items came out before rolls did, and half of our groups didnt come out until the end of the meal (after asking servers several times about our food. the disappointing part was the table next to us got their food way before we did, and they sat well into half of our meal).   this place is definitely a must try, if you've never been. but a regular spot? probably not. as a college student, its hard to pay $30 (including tip) for one meal as often as i'd like to. but when i do have some extra money, i will definitely be back!",

I live off nigiri and their fish here is rancid, including their version of toro. Cut of the fish is also thinner than usual. The rolls are decent; the best thing on their menu is the poke bowl and sizzling platters, but both not worth the AYCE price. Better bet is to just make the drive to goyemon or sushimon.

Tun was the chef making most of our rolls and he even introduced us to the supervisor Nye who offered us some complimentary Sake which we turned down because we were already on our second bottle.  They have a happy hour from 11pm-2am with buy one get one Sake or Beer.  They also had just launched ladies night which knocked down the price for the lovely lady on the All-You-Can-Eat to $21.  We started with the Seaweed Salad before we moved on to the fabulous rolls.  We had the Monster, Japanese Garlic Lasagna, Dragon, Vegas, and Oyshi rolls.  We wish we could have tried more but we were stuffed.  We sat around chatting with the friendly staff and drinking Sake until we had a little more room in our tummies for dessert.

My first visit was a couple of years ago but it wasn't that memorable to me, but two Thursdays ago, it was VERY  memorable.  But not in a good way.  I understand that a restaurant doesn't really decide when it's busy or not. But when I went two weeks ago on a Thursday for dinner, I really didn't expect the amount of neglect that my party of three received. We all ordered off of the AYCE menu and some dishes from the kitchen.   In the duration of 30 minutes, we got nothing from the kitchen except miso soup. When we asked our server, he just nonchalantly shrugged and said it was a busy night. Barely saw him after that and just felt like he was avoiding our table.   When we did get our nigiri and rolls, I really did wish it could've been SO MUCH BETTER to redeem the time that we wasted. There was so much rice in our sushi that it might've been better to just serve a bowl of rice. I understand that you're not supposed to discard the rice but I'm not paying for the rice, I'm under the impression that I'm paying for the sushi.  That night, we ordered dessert but we didn't have energy to waste another 20 minutes. We just left.  I really wanted to like this place after my very first encounter years ago wasn't that impressive. But seems like this restaurant has proved that first impressions always last.",

They had us sit in a private area because we were a party of 15, and I don't know if it was due to that fact but the total experience was dampen by their lack of organization when it came to ordering and getting our food.   We all got the AYCE, so that right there was already less of a headache or so I thought. We even helped out by writing our orders on the napkins. That part was a cinch but when it came to actually receiving our orders, it was a mess. First, the dishes came out one at a time and then later on we were told that they were putting orders together in one plate: the tempura for example, which had we known, wouldn't have been a problem and could've just passed it around. Instead, people were waiting for their orders to arrive only to find out it was already given to the end of the table. We didn't want to keep ordering as we weren't aware if they were just backed up or totally forgotten. We were finally told towards the middle of the meal what they were doing, when half of the party was agitated already. Don't mess with hungry Filipinos LOL.     The food is just OK, quality is nowhere as good as some of our preferred sushi places, it's AYCE I know, but I've been to other AYCE places where their nigiri's taste so much better and fresher. Now their green tea creme brulee is in a league of its own, I could eat about 5 of those suckers lol, it might be the only reason for me to come back hahaha oh and the unlimited ice cream.",

If you come on a Saturday like I did I would say expect a wait. This place gets busy  quick which is no surprise as it probably is one of the best AYCE places on that side of town.  After getting some delicious rolls you should try the green tea creme brulee to end your meal!",

I always suggest to order that! Another thing, they are open LATE! That's pretty convenient when you are talking sushi----most times you crave it and its around 9pm, no sweat, this place is open till 1am!

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Friday around 2-3PM. The place was pretty empty(which I like) and we sat at the bar. We ordered a few apps, a coke and hot tea, which comes in a pot instead of them just bringing you a glass from time to time. Apps came almost all at once which I'm usually hesitant about as it usually means they cook something and let it sit until other stuff is done, so most of your order sat and died..... that's definitely what happened to say the rib-eye app I got, it was chewy as hell, as well as the baked mussels, they came cold. But the rest was very good so 2 small issues, moving on. We started ordering rolls and Nigiri. The chef who was just in front of us seemed to be on prep duty (refilling fish and chopping ingredients) so everything we ordered he relayed to someone else to make. It shouldn't bother me, but it did a little when another customer sat down a little ways away and whatever she asked for he made on the spot. What's that phrase about chopped liver? The rolls that did come were actually very good. I must have ordered 3 or 4 orders of the squid nigiri with shiso leaf. Highly recommend that one, and if the service hadn't rubbed me the wrong way I'd be back with bells on and a perfect 5-star review. But it did, I won't be, and 4-star~",

The price for the all you can eat sushi was definitely a good price! For the all you can eat, you can order anything from the menu! The sweet shrimp and dynamite were my favorites. Also, don't forget to order dessert! There are some limitations on the menu for the quantity of sushi that can be ordered for certain items.

I think the chef just had a heavy hand that night with the dressing. My friend loves their baked mussels. I'm not a fan of mussels so none for me.  AYE includes a choice of dessert. Their berry parfait with your choice of vanilla or green tea ice cream is devine! They also have mochi and green tea tiramisu. Stay away from that green tea tiramisu...not good at all!!

    "text": "Use to be regular, happy customers here at Oyshi. But today was just not good. Service was extremely slow despite there being multiple workers talking and not doing anything with half the restaraunt being empty, parts of our order was forgotten and never even showed up (we were here for 2 hrs+ and ordered Japanese Lasagna right away knowing it takes awhile to make and it never showed up), our waters were only filled once. As a worker in a sushi restaurant as well, this is entirely unacceptable and would warrant termination at some places. The food was also not as fresh as it use to be: first of all, fish should not be crunchy or have the consistency of well-done steak. The tuna took effort to chew through as did the salmon. The color of the tuna was a greyish red color and did not look apetizing. Also the downtime between orders was ridiculous: waited nearly 20 minutes for a Philadelphia hand roll after having to remind our server, waited another 30 min before the next round was taken (with a good 10 minute wait for only 4 orders of simple nigiri), our check was taken by someone who was not our server and it disappeared for awhile (which is worrisome when the card is in there), and our desert (Ice cream parfait) took so long we nearly forgot it was coming and almost left. Also, when a customer inquires about an order, don't interrupt like I'm being impatient for asking where my food is. If I ask, it has been awhile. Our server had a nice personality, but he kept disappearing throughout our time there (let me remind you, we, a party of 2, were there for 30 min). I'm so appalled by the serviced we experienced today and I'm not sure if we will ever come back.",

The crab is fake, when we asked the waiter if it's not real crab what is it then he was stuttering and you can tell he pulled the answer out of his ass by picking random fishes that are in the fake crab. So 28$ for all you can eat and you don't even get real crab what on earth. When I got home I had the biggest stomach ache ever I had to rock myself back and forth to fall asleep because I was not feeling well at all.

Not only is it in \"my neck of the woods\"--SW Las Vegas, but it serves wonderful sushi and hot meals, has incredible service and inviting, fun atmosphere. Oyshi does not disappoint, and I have been to most sushi places in town. The fish is always incredibly fresh and delicisous and hot foods and rolls are creative and very tasty. The presentation is top notch too, especially for the price. That's right, the price is on the low side for \"all you can eat\" sushi as compared to other neighborhood sushi places in town; Big flat screen televisions, always running mini fountains and modern decor add to the wonderful, fun, yet inviting atmosphere. Servers all speak English and are knoweledgeable about all of the dishes and make great recommendations!!! I love this sushi restaurant and have frequented it about twice a month, if not more often. Oyshi in Japanese means \"delicious\" and this restaurant surely lives up to its name in every sense of the word. Highly recommended.",

The trick, however, is that all their rolls have some sort of cream cheese or mayonnaise in it and make them so heavy and sweet tasting that you can't eat more than a few rolls.  If you like an extra helping of creamy toppings on your sushi than this place is for you.  If you prefer fresh sushi rolls the way they are supposed to be made than stay away!",

We got there, and were greeted and seated right away. Once seated, it took a little while for our server to come and get our drink orders. We all were doing AYCE and we already knew what we wanted to order first. Before we could tell her that, she quickly walked away like she had other things to do. It took about 20 minutes to finally get our drinks, and even then she didn't ask if we were ready to order- she just walked away!!! Minutes later she finally came back to take our order. It probably took another 20-30 minutes to get our first roll. Keep in mind, it wasn't even busy! There were probably about 6 other parties there, minus the few people at the bar. After we finished our first roll, we were all ready to order our next 2. About this time, we've been there for an hour and we only had 1 roll each. A bit ridiculous since the time limit for AYCE is 2 hours!!! We were ignored for the rest of the time after we were able to order our 2nd rolls, and had to reorder all of our rolls, and when we finally got them, our baked rolls were cold, and the fish was mushy. GROSS! We got no refills on our drinks. Overall, terrible experience and terrible service.  I probably wouldn't be as bitter if the manager acted like he cared when i went to complain....",

He informed us that this place was a spin-off of Sushi Factory (in Las Vegas).  It's a bit out of the way from \"The Strip\", but if you have the time it's well worth it.  Anyway, after a horrible experience at Sushi Factory (see my review) several months ago, my buddies and I decided to give Oyshi a go.  We couldn't have been any happier with our visit to Oyshi.  Our server (Justin) was very friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  As for the food, the sashimi was fresh, the rolls were tasty, the ambiance was comfortable, simple and modern.  By the way, the Ama ebi (sweet shrimp) and Uni (sea urchin) were both very fresh and delicious.  However, I was bummed that each customer was limited to one order of Ama ebi and Uni per customer.  But being that both are very expensive items, one can understand.  If you're looking for a great, affordable sushi dinner in the Las Vegas area, look no further than Oyshi.  I hope they keep up the good service, and not falter like that of Sushi Factory.",

Salmon is usually my safe bet when it comes to sushi, but after one piece of nigiri, I was done.   I couldn't believe how bad it was.  I can't remember what else we had, but it wasn't impressive enough to make up for the bad salmon.",

    "text": "Oyshi, well what can I say. It is an all you can eat sushi place that is run by Koreans. The decor is very modern and there are several water sculptures that is placed around the restaurant. They also have private rooms and large Plasma tvs that will show a basketball game or two. I was introduced to this sushi place by a friend of mines and went for the first time a couple of months ago. I have to say their appetizer menu is, by far, superior to all AYCE sushi places. Their surf and turf has this sweet and tangy sauce, it is served over a bed of shredded greens with steak and shrimp on a hot plate that is sizzling as it arrives. Their oysters are fairly good served with a bit of chili sauce and you can have max of 4. I have gone back to Oyshi about 3 times and this review is a collective of all the times I dined there. The first time I dined I ordered some salmon, tuna, yellowtail, nigiri. I was very very impressed with the quality and ratio of rice to fish. I asked the waiter what he would recommend as it was my first time dining there and he immediately chirped \"love affair\" you must have it. It was very very good. I do have to say it took them over 20 minutes to bring out my order of nigiri and even longer for the love affair roll. There were probably 10 people dining there. I was kind of confused as a couple that came after us got their roll first. I am normally a service junkie and if I don't get it I usually don't ever step back into the restaurant. This restaurant seemed like a place that deserved a second chance. I went another time with a group of 9 and were sat in a semi private area where the wall had a huge mural that seemed hand painted. We were seated and they took our orders. The wait wasn't as painful this time as they brought out the food fairly quickly. Once again, the love affair roll and my classic salmon, tuna and yellowtail nigiri were wonderful. The third time I went was pretty similar to the first time I dined here. The service was subpar and their food seemed to lack flavor. I have to say if their service was at par with how their decor is I would probably have given a higher rating, but without good service the clients will never return. Maybe they deserve another chance? I have to wait and see.",

We all had the $26 dollar all you can eat sushi, but to our surprise each time we ordered there was always 2-3 items missing and separate orders came on mixed plates and we never know who's was who's because of the lack of communications. And it seemed that the waitress was more into making comments about how our lady friends clothes looked rather than what we were actually missing. They dont have have the common courtesy or moral needed to keep customers coming back. The joint doesnt run on a 1 hour limit like sushi mon but because of last nights horrible customer service I would have rather taken and paid for everyone to go to SUSHI-MON, YOU PRICKS HEAR THAT? 1 hour and 40 minutes pass and we still had not recieved half of our orders. One friend of mine ordered 4 items and they proceeded to only retrieve one roll of sushi for the rest of the night. The horrible service provided guarantees that EVERYONE I know will hear about this place and will never EVER be coming back.",

The Lobster Roll is definitely a must! There are a couple of things that I didn't like though: they do not do half rolls on their sushi. Be careful when you're ordering your rolls as it can fill up your table pretty quickly. The Nigiri option wasn't available for all you can eat, which seemed odd as AYCE dinner is priced at $28 per person, a bit higher than other places and they serve nigiri, even if at a limit. Finally, the staff. While friendly and attentive enough, two of the servers had little knowledge of their menu as far as what to recommend or what is in the roll. Seemed a little off putting to know what you're serving. Other than that, the food tasted great.",

No wait at all and got a table instantly.   We had been here a few times before and this place was fairly decent. They use to not limit on the salmon belly so much but now, it was 2 orders per person (4 pieces total). Sad face !  The fish was pretty decent here (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, superwhite tuna, uni). Ikura seemed a bit \"thick\" as the \"juice\" felt a bit more slimy than its supposed to be? Maybe slightly old? dunoe.   As some say, rice is more important than the fish, and i kind of agree. Oyshi's rice was not my favorite. It was ok, MUCH MUCH better than how they used to be though.   Haven't been to AYCE in a long while (few months at least) and didn't realize price was at $28/person.

Craving sushi tonight and being near Oyshi, which we hadn't been too in 5+ years, we gave AYCE one more shot. We are now leaving the parking lot blissfully stuffed and more than satisfied with the remarkable service. We were pleased from the moment we sat down. Our server, Troy, greeted us with warmth and candor. He made suggestions and guaranteed us a wonderful dinner experience, which he confidently delivered. His recommendations were delicious and his service lacked nothing. Overall, we had a more delightful and fulfilling sushi experience than we have had in years. I wish I owned a restaurant so I could poach Troy and offer him a management position. I am still highly suspicious of most other AYCE sushi joints, nevertheless we will return to see Troy as often as we can.",

I ordered the creme brulee for dessert. This wasn't the best that I've had. You can tell it's one of those \"instant powder mixed with water\" type of desserts. I think next time I'll ask for mochi ice cream instead.  Parking can be a little bit if a hassle because Oyshi shares the lot with other areas.  With that said, I'm sure I'll be back.

I ordered sushi because this is the first sushi restaurant I been at that sashimi isn't included on the AYCE. Okay, fine I let that go. Once my sushi orders came out every fish (tuna, yellowtail, albacore, salmon) tasted the same. By that meaning it was the most rubbery fish I've ever tasted, I've never forced myself to eat such disgusting AYCE. You can't even do half rolls, but okay not all sushi restaurants allow that. The only thing enjoyable through this entire experience was my Mochi mango. Let alone the server was completely rude to my boyfriend. He ordered a raw steak off the sizzling platter, not included in the AYCE. When his order came out it wasn't sizzling let alone it was blue rare when he had ordered rare. Once they re made his order it came out well done. At that point we just ate what we had and left as quick as possible. Of course a tip was still left but it's wasn't the 18% that was deserved.",

    "text": "Another 5 star review?! Am I feeling generous or what? So Oyshi is definitely a solid AYCE sushi option especially if you are in the southwest area. I think most Vegas people have been coming here for years and I can say I've never been disappointed. Recently came here 2 weeks ago after not going to this specific location for quite some time. The fish to rice ratio is pretty good because there is minimal rice. In fact you can probably remove the rice and they may not even notice. I must admit my favorite is the salmon belly- absolutely delicious! My mouth is watering as I write this review. Oysters were super fresh and tasty as well and they also add some garnish to it. This adds to the taste of the oysters and overall appeal. If you need a break from sushi, they have a Sirloin (or ribeye, honestly can't remember) served on a sizzle plate which is pretty tasty as well. The dessert items are pretty unique so I ordered the green tea creme brulee. I didn't know they have a green tea tiramisu as well so I'll probably have that the next time I come here. Doing AYCE with a group is way better experience than if it's two people. So I do recommend that, but I assume most people already knew this. Lastly, they can accommodate your group if you're celebrating an occasion because there's a private room my party has used in the past. Not sure if this room requires a reservation in advanced though.",

I never got offered a refill & She never removed a single dirty plate from me, I even staked them up so when I ordered dessert my area would be clean & easier to Pre-Bus. WRONG- not even after requesting for my bill and her returning after running my card did she ever bothered of cleaning my table she just keep going back to chitchat as if that was more important.  Wish I had learned her name but she never introduced herself, or had a name tag. But the receipt said server : 0022  Note:  I only left a 20% tip because servers & kitchen staff all share tips. Sushi Chefs were pleasant and attentive, & informed me about how to order next time so I could try more things on the menu.   Too bad my experience was subpar, I won't be coming back.",

The fish inside the sibuya roll was overcooked also. Don't know what happened here today. 11/9/2018 ordered at 1:15  Dec. 6 Ordered again today and vegas roll isn't overcooked anymore. I guess they listened to my review. Everything was good this time. calamari still crunchy.",

    "text": "I do love sushi and Oyshi's is good, but the AYCE service leaves something to be desired. Service is very slow, and orders come when the chef decides to prepare them, not when you ordered it.  Orders have been forgotten and errors made repeatedly. Because its all-you-can-eat maybe there's a sense that mistakes don't matter if you accept the dish, since it's all the same price.    Those complaints aside, the food is done well and isn't oversized and sloppy like some AYCE places. You can tell the chefs care about presentation. I can't think of any food of poor quality there.    My tips for this place would be to: 1) come with a list 2) order a variety of items at once. When they arrive, order the next batch.  3) make sure everyone at the table agrees to order in batches, otherwise everyone  will be sitting around waiting for ages until your next lonely order arrives- and that second order could take 30 minutes or more! 4) save room for the tiny dessert. It comes with the AYCE.",

I would have to say my favorite was the Pink Lady Roll.  That roll had several types of fish and wrapped in a pink soy wrapper.  Very nice.  We also tried the RockN' Roll, the Atomic Bomb, Salmon Lover, Yellowtail Trio, Hawaiian  and other specialty rolls.    After eating at a different AYCE near Summerlin I had a fresh comparison.  I found what we had was all very fresh and tasty, prepared to order.  We also had seaweed salsa, rib eye appetizer, ahi poke,  and desert was included, too.  I had strawberry mochi ice cream and tasted the green tiramisu.  Thomas was our waiter and was very attentive in locating each of us with our orders.  He was very good.  Yes, it did take a little while to wait for some of the rolls, but we were ordering a lot of food and the quality and taste made it worth the wait.    I will definitely be back with my friends and I'll bring a bigger appetite!",

When I asked the server if he could change the station he said 'It's Pandora and it's censored.\"  I told him I heard the 'F' word several times and he continued to argue with me. I had my two grandchildren and was horrified. Then the sushi came and it was terrible.

    "text": "We had so bad experience here today. As my friends and I  have lunch here, servers were not nice.. At the moment, there were no many parties of customers, that means it wasn't busy at all. At the sushi bar, there were about four sushi chefs, and there were about at least 3 servers. Yet, our orders were delayed unnecessarily, and didn't receive any customer service. They didn't come to check if foods are ok. We got foods long after we ordered, and some of foods we ordered wasn't even put in and made. But we rather got foods we didn't order, or ones we canceled. I told a server that that's what we canceled, and the foods  we ordered earlier didn't came out. We were not ok with all of them at all today. A chef just came out and asked if we are chinese or korean. And asked if we canceled orders of spicy tuna and some other order. I said we did, and he answered us to enjoy our meal, but his attitude and tone of voice seemed like he had something to complain. The head chef, looked at us and laughed at us while he's passing by our table. Obviously it wasn't smile he may normally treat to customers. We felt so uncomfortable that we asked if we can talk to manager about many things since we had not only bad customer service ,but also foods were so bad. A server said that manager is not here. We paid for our check, and left. But we were definitely not ok with all of them, so we got in the restaurant again and if we can get manager's contact. The chef, who came to our table and told if we canceled food, seemed worried with us, so asked if there were anything went wrong. We told him about things we wanted to complain. He looked like he's pretending to listen to us. Looking uncomfortable with what we said, he asked what he can compensate with(but obviously his attitude was to get out of the situation). He took out his wallet and said \"I will refund for the price you paid.\" No one of us wanted to get refund, but his unnecessary action wasn't appropriate with the situation. He could have apologized about his and employees' faults sincerely, but he just tried to solve situation with his money. If he really wanted to compensate for bad service and was going to give us money back, he should have asked cashier to give us money back instead of taking out his wallet. There were even more things to say about foods, but I will reserve my opinion about food since it can reflect my bad feelings from bad experience.   Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. In korean culture, it's common that older people treat younger people poorly. But chef Ed, who asked our age, He didn't have to ask and talk about our age in spite of our young looking-appearence. Was that really necessary to ask our age? His attitude definitely made it worse. The attitude you have shown was not professional at all.",

    "text": "For the past several trips to Vegas, Oyshi has been our first stop we make before heading in to strip to check in to our hotel. We always order the all you can eat sushi. Our usual dishes are the raw Oysters, Ikura, Uni, Ono, Scallop, Yellowtail, Salmon, Softshell Crab... But they ran out if uni the last time we were there, so if you want uni, go there early if you can.  Everything is always fresh and service is great, even on a busy night! There could be a wait on the weekends, but it's totally worth the wait! Some say that the AYCE price is a little high, but if you could see how much we eat, you can say that we definitely ate more than our money's worth!!!",

We ordered off the all-you-can-eat menu and believe me, it was a huge menu.  Will all restuarants like this, if you leave any leftovers, they will charge you, but I have a feeling they dont follow through w that.  The price was around $25, but hello, we ordered tons of shashimi and rolls worth way more than that.  You also get dessert with your meal and alcohol is extra (of course).  You won't find tourists here, just locals and regulars who knows you don't have to be at some fancy shmancy restuarant to eat good sushi.",

My favorite appetizer is the surf and turf.  My favorite rolls consist of the Red Rock, Volcano, and Rainbow.  You can order half portions here, so that way you can choose to sample several rolls, or just stick to a couple full rolls.  There is almost always a wait, but it's well worth it.  The staff is super friendly and I have never dealt with poor customer service any of the times I have dined there.  The couple times I have sat at the bar have been great experiences too - the chefs are all nice.  It's in a great location, but I have driven past it a couple times without realizing it. Really, I have nothing but positive things to say!",

An order to make it unique and enjoyable is by starting with the staff members on how to provide good customer service and take pride of what they representing. I am pretty sure the owner doesn't care as well because if he does he would take ownership and control of his restaurant sence this issue is been the same for majority the time this restaurant is been opened. Very disappointed long time waiting for appetizers and extremely slow service and lack of knowledge and skills from staff members as a whole restaurant aspect.",

How the restaurant looks. 2. Selection of sushi 3. How the restaurant makes me feel.  Right off the bat, you're welcomed with high end decor that depicts Japanese culture. Oyshi is nothing short of class. I'm a very limited sushi order. Ironically, I'm allergic to fish (I know, right?). However, I am able to eat shell fish, and that is good enough for me to fall in love with this new craze. They have fresh selections and a whole section of shell fish sushi.   And what I love the most about Oyshi sushi, is that it's not some hole in the wall, dirty little restaurant. It's classy, sophisticated, and it's a spot you can bring your valued company. I actually refuse to bring dates here because I don't want them to tarnish this place for me. Highly recommended. They'll remember your name because they remember mine. But it doesn't help that I'm there every week.",

Yes, you would have to pay a bit more, however, I would rather  pay a bit more than be unhappy after spending almost $30 pp. I also wasn't keen on the house music being blasted like we are at some club.

The sushi here wouldn't pass at the very top tier sushi restaurants in town (like nobu, shibuya etc.) but it is as good as the best normally priced sushi spots in town. Bottom line, great quality sushi and for $25 you can stuff yourself silly... Updated my review to three stars as the quality here has notably gone downhill in the last year... It's not unusual to have sushi come out cut inconsistently and sloppy. Also, service here has suffered. Hopefully push I gets its act together, but until then I'll eat somewhere else.",

The atomic bomb was the only roll I thought was pretty good, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. The Sunrise roll I did not care for at all. It tasted like it was soaked in a garlic soy sauce. The Iris Special roll was very difficult to eat. The sauce tasted very similar to the sauce in the Sunrise roll, but it was a completely different sauce. There was a pasty, yet grainy texture to it and the flavor was pretty gross.   All in all, I don't think i'd go there again.",

The rolls didn't look fresh, the size of the salmon cuts or anything really are half now! I got very disappointed when I left the place, It use to be my favorite must go place in Vegas.  The one good thing about them is I already complained about the service once and they took very good care of me, so I'm assuming if they figure it out the service went down considerably they will definitely take care and made it tool as good as before.",

Then we ask to order more, we put an order in for two more rolls, waited 10 mins he comes back and asks if we wanna order dessert so we order that and he brings them over so me and my friend look at each other confused bc we ordered two more rolls and he clearly didn't put that order in so we just paid and left.

    "text": "I am still in love with this place!! Since it was just me and a friend, we opted for first available seating Nd that ended up being at the bar. It's a while new environment when you sit at the bar! If it's just you and a friend, I recommend sitting at the bar. If it's you and your family or a large group, stick to a table. But I do recommend experiencing the bar when you can.   By sitting at the bar, you are face to face with the sushi chefs. You may order your rolls directly from them and if you are daring, you can just have them make rolls for you without necessarily going off the menu (AYCE guests only, I'm guessing). Since it was the first time sitting at the bar for both of us, we didn't know that was possible until we had already ordered the world and we were just about bursting at the seams. We did try a fatty tuna sushi though which was basically made with tuna belly. It was sooooooo good!!   We also had a bottle of lychee sake. It came in a wine sized bottle, but we decided to take shots of it. It was so yum and it basically tasted like juice. Which is dangerous because it had the same alc vol as wine, and my friend and I finished the bottle like it was nothing!   Here are a few things that I think would be great to keep in mind while you're here:  -if you and a friend are looking to hang out, enjoy great food, and be social, definitely sit at the bar and have the chefs make you whatever your heart desires  -it's all you can eat, so definitely come here with an empty stomach and be prepared to eat the world! BUT...on busy nights, the wait can be awhile and if you come here super hungry, once you're seated, you'll want to order everything at once! This may not be a good thing, cuz if you're anything like us, you'll stuff your face and be done within 30 minutes.  -if you're paying with multiple cards, make sure the person taking your payment knows what exactly is going on what card. Although  we thought that we were clear in our instructions, she still managed to charge the wrong amount! (I'm not sure if this girl just wasn't paying attention or just wasn't having it because it was so busy, but I remember she was also being a bit rude when she was calling people for their tables)",

    "text": "Wow...I didn't realize that I haven't done a review for one of my favorite AYCE sushi joints.  Anyway...here it is:  Located on the southwest side of town at the corner of Rainbow and Robindale.  Plenty of parking.  Customer service is a bit lacking compared to when they first opened but I'm sure it's cause they always have a full house.  Reasonable price for AYCE at $21.00 for lunch and $26.00 for dinner.  They have a wide range of menu options which includes appetizers, sashimi/sushi, signature rolls, entrees, kids menu, and my favorite...desserts.  They also have food options for vegetarians.    There are private dining areas for a more intimate experience with seating from 5-20+ people.  The smaller private room seats about 5+ people and has couches for seating and a tv, so while you are dining you can chillax, enjoy your food, and be entertained by the tv.  The larger room can seat about 20+ so it's ideal for larger parties but there are no couches, just regular seats, however, there is a tv.",

I'm a dessert person, so if you are too, I don't recommend this place. Too much rule when it comes to eating all you can eat. Where can you see all you can eat but only allow you to eat one piece of dessert per person from the entire dessert menu?? They taking time on serving your food too and leave you one napkin and you have to ask for extra. This is my first and will be the last time eating here.",

As for their desserts, I think they're ok. Nothing too spectacular. I'd recommend coming here for the consistently good AYCE. Be sure to come with an appetite!",

All time favorite side dish has to be surf and terf which consist of fried steak and shrimp handed it to you still sizzling! One of the best sushi rolls is the love affair because tt has some lobster in it ;).   Their alcohol prices are reasonable for the portions they serve you. It can be slow at times when its busy, but definitely worth the wait. Every time i go they, it seems like i'm in a club since they play house or clubbing music lol. A great place to go but not in a large group.   Great place overall :-(D",

    "text": "I live right down the street from this place so I try to come in whenever I can. I usually sit at the sushi bar to interact w/ the chef's and it's quicker to get your food. I've been here numerous times, but my review stems from the last few times I have come to visit. Most recently my gf & I came in for dinner and the host was not at her station so we proceeded to head to the sushi bar where I typically sit. We sat down and the hostess came to us and asked if someone sat us. We said no due to no one being at the host stand. She said I need to seat you. I informed her, we are already seated and we would like to sit here. She told us the server who worked in that area wasn't accepting tables. We asked if the server working the whole bar? She went back to the stand to look and I followed. She went to go speak w/ another employee to ask if it was okay. I'm guessing the hostess was new since she didn't know what to do. When she came back, she took us back exactly to where we originally went to sit. Pretty frustrating to say the least. So now we are under the impression we have a server. Not really though. A woman came to our seats and provided us w/ a setup and took a drink order. After that, nothing. About 8 minutes went by and the server, our server, comes up and asks us what we wanted to eat. No apology, just took our order. Once we ordered our food, everything was business as usual.  I've had spotty service here since coming here. I come for the food and that's why I sit at the sushi bar because it cuts out the time the server has to take to grab the food and deliver it. The chef just hands it to you. The best option here is the AYCE because just about everything is up for grabs. Oh and if you don't know, which most don't since it's not on the menu, you can order pork belly. It comes in a serving of 4. Even regulars that come in don't know. You're welcome :)",

The service was always good and the creativity and execution of the rolls was awesome. Went last night with two of my guy friends. I owed one sushi for losing a bet and the other was tagging along. We ordered a few appetizers, some nigiri (12 pieces total between the three of us), and 4 rolls. It took about 20 minutes to get our food. When it came out it was not as good. I got a piece of salmon that had what I assume was cartilage that was like chewing on leather. I've never had that happen with sushi before. Obviously, sushi by nature is somewhat chewy, but this was inedible. We ordered a few more rolls and it took forvever for it to come out. The avocados on the caterpillar roll were browning. The waitress rarely came to check on us. Not what I had come to expect from this place, but from what I hear this is the status quo now. Will no longer make the drive out and instead go to I Love Sushi or Sushi Mon.",

It is one of my favorites, (steak and shrimp). But We waited OVER AN HOUR for one tiny dish. I am so freaking upset!!! I don't think I've ever been this upset with a restaurant. Bad service and attitude I can fix, but losing my order?! Must be a lie. I wouldn't put any of the fault on the waitress... BUUUUUUT  when I asked about it the first time, and she said she'd check on it and get back to us, she never did! So another 30 minutes came and I asked, AGAIN, she finally kept her promise and checked on it. But an hour later!!! This all could've been avoided if she actually went and checked on it the first time when she said she would. Then she  tells us they lost our ticket?! We were all done eating, so the people I was with had to wait for me to eat it, and I didn't get to enjoy it cause I was already pretty full, when it was the FIRST thing I ordered over an hour ago. It wasn't even rush hour. The place wasn't even busy! NO stars for the staff this time around. If I'm paying the all you can eat price, please meet the order request from your customers! Otherwise, why the hell am I paying  the all you can eat price? I understand accidents happen and tickets get lost. But YOU need to understand, that's what results in Yelp reviews. Maybe this can better improve the system.",

I've always been coming here for a good 4-6 years & have never had a bad experience, but this time was amazing. New menus, some new items & some of the freshest sushi on this side of town in Vegas. From starting with the baked mussels, rolls & fresh nigiri sushi we were very satisfied.  The food was sooo delicious that we didn't even take photos, but the one photo I attached best describes our experience here! Coming back again and again and AGAIN!",

    "text": "Just got back from dinner here. So this probably won't be as long as my other reviews but here goes...  I was with a party of 11 and we were celebrating my girlfriend's coworker's birthday so sushi it was.  Traditionally I'm not a huge fan of AYCE because being a pseudo-sushi snob, I'm all about sashimi and freshness and AYCE limits how much you can get of both.   This place was no exception. The dinner menu was fairly big with a pretty good selection of rolls and appetizers. So that's good if you don't mind rubbery tasting fish and undercooked sushi rice.   Again, I'm a snob and prefer ordering items ala carte and I understand that in ACYE spots you sacrifice quality for quantity and that's understandable but there's definitely other ACYE spots in town and some of them offer a little bit more bang for your buck.  The miso was good. And they had pork belly. The pork belly was a little more fatty than I'm used to but it wasn't bad.  Although not a huge fan of the food, the service was top notch. Everyone was very diligent and super nice. So that alone gives this place a solid 3.",

There were 4 people in our party both times and I think we over order both times.  We definitely get our money worth from the way we have ordered AHHAHAHA   The first time, we mainly order all kinds of rolls.  We were so stuff to the point we have to cancel some of the rolls we have placed order and we barely touch our dessert.  This time around, we didn't order as much rolls and more entrees and appetizers.  we were able to enjoy our dessert this time.  Food: Their rolls are all good.  However, we have our favorite: Japanese garlic lasagna. OMG. so good, we have to order that again this time around. You gotta try that when you can.  We got Asian style skirt steak and rib eye steak sizzling platter and both were delicious! even though we were getting full, we still try to finish all the meat.   I just love the fact they include good dessert instead of just ice cream.  you have a choice of mochi ice cream, creme brulee,and green tiramisu (matcha flavor tiramisu).  My boyfriend and I shared creme brulee and green tiramisu.  I like their creme brulee better.   Service: both times were nice.  however, our server from the 2nd time she was great.  when I was ordering the 1st round, she suggested to order 2nd round already because they are having a 16 people party in the party room and kitchen might get backed up.  Which is very kind for her to inform us instead of waiting to order 2nd or 3rd round.  our food kept coming in without any breaks. thanks so much for the suggestion.",

That being said, if you're looking for a quick in and out experience, this is not your spot. If you're going to come here, you need to be prepared to wait (to be seated). Although a wait, the end result will be worth it!   It's not a quiet place, TV's are usually on and the place is usually rocking. It's definitely not overboard on the noise but you might have to speak up with the people at the table.   Once your seated and ready to chow, they normally work at a great pace on getting your orders and food out for you to enjoy.   Sushi always taste great!! If the wife or family is craving a sushi night, we usually find ourselves having Oyshi as our top 1-2 choices to go!",

AYCE includes appetizers, hand rolls, cut rolls, baked rolls, and dessert. The AYCE here isn't done with tally's on a paper, you just order as much as you want at any given time. This is good for large parties and they have private areas for reservations. Again, this place is decent, presentation of the sushi rolls can use a little work, but the taste is pretty good.  They have 2 locations in Vegas. One on Rainbow and Sahara. If you were to ask me, I think the Sahara one is better! Their portion of seaweed salad is a lot more, if you're a fan of that :p",

The service is prompt and attentive, never leaving you with an empty glass or in need of another round of food. The menu can seem intense, but fear not - it's laid out in a fairly simple manner, in which if you order from left to right you'll cover starters, nigiri, cold rolls and cooked rolls - making it easy to then go back and re-order your favorites.   My favorite thing about the Oyshi locations is the freshness of their fish. I've been to far too many sushi joints in Vegas where I'm completely sketched out by what's served to me.   I love their ahi poke - it comes on seaweed salad and is limitless!!, and my husband is obsessed with their garden salad's dressing - he'll order multiple salads when we're doing AYCE (which I think is a win for his body in general!). The skirt steak and ribeye are sizzling plates which are PACKED with yum.   I can't get enough of the nigiri - the fresh scallop is my favorite, followed closely by salmon belly, salmon, tuna, blue fin, squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon with lemon, sweet shrimp, super white, you name it. We also get healthy orders of the simply shrimp, catepillar, red rock (no cream cheese), yellowtail trio, man I eat it all.",

    "text": "Love, love, love Oyshi! Their AYCE options are endless and their Cajun albacore is so good! I usually order 6-8 orders (12-18 pieces) for a group of 3-4 of us doing the AYCE, just to get us going.  I do suggest one minor tip if it applies--order bottled water over tap water. I'm not sure why but their tap water is just really bad (and I am by no means super picky with water). A minor flaw in the whole scheme of things.   The atmosphere is nice; the music is definitely geared towards younger clientele, but it's great and slaps at times. Vibes like a night club playlist that is primarily hiphop based.   They're pretty fast at turning over tables, yet you'll never feel rushed during your meal (which is so important with AYCE dinners). If you have a large party, I highly suggest calling ahead or making a reservation (if allowed) as they are always hoppin', especially during dinner hours. It's never a long wait for food to arrive and employees are casually clearing plates frequently. Again, you'll never feel rushed or bothered by the attentiveness of the staff--they're stealthy with their work!  Looking for a great lunch or dinner spot, with friends, family or coworkers?--Oyshi Sushi is your place! Choose the AYCE option so you and your party can try different options at a fair price point (but do no over order). Ask your server for recommendations if you're overwhelmed with what to chose. The specials are always delicious too!",

    "text": "I use to love this place but once it got popular the quality has gone down.... I have been served multiple times now Salmon sashimi that has a fishy taste that I never have experienced before at this restaurant. They have obviously gone down on the quality of fish they buy in order to compensate for the increase in their customers. I tried to give them multiple chances because I assumed it was just maybe a one time event but nope... here I am again eating fishy salmon sashimi  #dobetter  I most definitely won't be back, I never know what I'm getting anymore .... they should probably have their workers taste the fish they're serving before serving it to their customers....",

    "text": "$28 for AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi!  I saw reviews by Rod U., Greg K., Ania K., Chel R., Norm K., and Roxanne Lynn T.  Solid four stars for this contemporary styled sushi bar!  It's not only AYCE sushi...it's also AYCE appetizers, tempura, sushi rolls, yakitori, etc. - everything except for the sashimi. It even includes one dessert!  We were hungry at dinnertime, so we got our money's worth with salmon, conch, salmon belly, scallops, ikura, eel, yellow tail, agedashi tofu, miso soup, a sizzling plate of rib-eye steak, and a Vegas Roll. From the Grill, we got beef wrapped asparagus and shrimp with asparagus. We also ordered the allotted one serving of amaebi and one serving of uni.  Yum!  I enjoyed the variety!  Our server was so polite and efficient. From across the room, I made a cutting motion and she brought over a set of knife and fork in a napkin.  So smart!    We wanted to cut up the Sushi Donut which is not a dessert. It's cleverly made to look like a donut by covering the outer layer with panko and sprinkling colored tobiko on the top to look like sprinkles!  The red \"icing\" was actually hot sauce!  Very clever!  For dessert, I got the parfait which consisted of a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with granola, berries, and whipped cream.  It was light enough and satisfying enough for me to not get dessert elsewhere!",

The service was slow and the nigiri and rolls did not seem fresh. I was pretty disappointed in the whole experience. I'm not going to come back again.",

I had no idea where I was in Vegas, but this place is in a shopping center with plenty of parking around. It's a pretty decent size and no many people were there when we arrive for dinner at 7 pm. It was 3x of us and we were seated right away. The waitress we had was very attentive. She was quick with refills and taking our sushi order. Everything we ordered was delicious and tasted fresh. I was so hungry that I forgot to take pix of the rolls. The all you can eat is worth it, but remember to not order too much because they do charge for any left over rolls.",

    "text": "I'm not from Vegas but today marks my 3rd time coming here and I look forward to making it a tradition each time i'm in town. This place is awesome. It's a bit of a drive off the strip, about 10 minutes but well worth it. It has a nice ambiance perfect for a date or a night out with the girls. There were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! All you can eat. I've been to many AYCE sushi places and they always give you fewer choices and just the basic appetizers and maybe a green tea ice cream for dessert. Not this place. They have a huge selection of rolls. They are so delicious. Ummm. They have so many appetizers to choose from. If your a meat eater you will appreciate it because they offer a lot of meat dishes. Last but not least if you have room the dessert is heavenly. They have creme brulee, green tea tiramisu, berry parfaits and one other that I cannot recall.  All this for 26 bucks. It's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that on Friday and Saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders. This still doesn't deter me from giving them 5 stars because the servers are really helpful and cordial when they do come back.",

We got there at about 8pm and on a weekday so it wasn't packed.  We had the best waiters though.  Service was excellent from the get go.  The people that work there are friendly and nice.  We ordered a few rolls and some appetizers to begin with.  We just took our time eating.  We weren't in a rush.  At times, we would take breaks and the waiter/waitress would check to see if we wanted to order anything.  All the rolls were fresh and tasty.  It's AYCE but they ask that you eat everything that you order.  Everything that we ordered was delicious.  We also ordered the seaweed salad and that was very nice.  The music is loud but it is also a place with a lot of energy.  I thought it was perfect.  We had a great experience and we will be back the next time we're in Vegas.",

The waiters are snobbish and rude and the manager has no backbone to stand up to them. On top of that, they super pack the rolls and sushi with rice and if you can't eat it all, they'll charge you for it. Our waiter was a fat dick (not the good kind, fat and an a$$hole) from the start of the night. He barely acknowledged us the whole night. Anytime we signaled him to order, he looked annoyed and wouldn't come over until ten minutes later. Again with the rice, the douche bag wanted to charge us $14 for not eating all the rice. WTF man, all the rice we didn't eat didn't even equal a bowl of rice they normally charge you $1 for. When we asked the manager about it, he was useless and just said, \"You don't have to tip the waiter. He doesn't expect a tip.\" After arguing about fairness and how the establishment has gone to crap, we walked out of there paying $4 extra for rice... You can have your $4 worth of rice along with the out of business sign Oyshi. Rude, snobby employees coupled with declining quality of food ain't keeping you in business much longer.",

As for the rolls if you like deep fried and spicy sauce all the way I gave it a 3.5 but it gets tiring real fast.  Many of the rolls where they say soft shell crab mix, only means 95% imitation crab mixed with 5% soft shell crab.  Was horrible.  Anyway I'm pretty sure if your not a sushi advocate then this place will be just as good for you, but I'm use eating good, real good so I'll give it an average rating of 3.

As we walked in, we immediately noticed the decor and thought it was so modern and clean. The place looked very inviting and the hip \"ultra lounge\" type music was cool, too. We sat at the sushi bar and opted for the all you can eat for $26 each. The menu had several good choices and all the food items, excluding sashimi, was included on the all you can eat. The quality and portions were pretty good too. We made sure we got our money's worth..and we did!  And they serve redbean ice cream as one of the dessert options. I would totally recommend this place if you want to try a new sushi restaurant in the Southwest part of Las Vegas. Great date night place, hint..hint to all you guys wanting to impress a girl.",

I got the all you can eat, and I got my $21 worth. No complaint there. But the sushi isn't very authentic in that it's nothing a Japanese person would readily recognize. Seems to be part of this \"fusion\" sushi movement. I told the sushi chef it wanted an omekase selection, and he had no idea what I was talking about. BAD SIGN! I probably should have just given up and gone to Osaka, but alas I stayed. Most of the rolls were average, but the yellowtail trio had a terrible ginger sauce. I couldn't finish it.   Aside from the food, the service was non-existent. I moved to a quiet corner to avoid a very loud group and I was completely forgotten. I had to get up and ask for my check after 15 minutes of waiting.  My biggest complaint is with the music. There is rap music blaring, even on a Sunday afternoon. I guess they're trying to attact a young, hip crowd, but they're really only driving away customers. I asked them to turn down the music to no avail, and left with a pounding headache and resolved not to come here again.",

I never received my Sapporo and was billed for it (I didn't pay for it).I imagine the trick is ordering the AYCE. The table next to us had it and received regular service, in fact, their water glasses were filled while ours were left empty. Place is not worth the lengthy drive from the strip.",

Food is always great--standard sushi fare. I believe it's $27 for All You Can Eat dinner, also pretty standard.",

I live in CA but each time we go out to Vegas we stop at Oyshi before hitting The Strip.  Quick tip: If you sit at the bar they permit you to order half rolls.",

Last time I was in it took forever for someone to seat us and there were multiple open seats with no one in front of us.  The service was just plain bad.  We had multiple servers who couldn't keep my wife's order straight(not a sushi eater) but always loved their Teriyaki Chicken Skewers.  They either change their teriyaki recipe or screwed up and put something else on it because it wasn't teriyaki. Food quality declined.  The specialty rolls seems to consist of more mayo based sauces than other ingredients.  Had to go through 3 different people to find the person to give me my check.    I noticed that many of the guys who I would always see working there in the past weren't there, maybe a coincidence or maybe not.    By the way Oyshi management-having your employees sleeping one off in the V.I.P. lounge in plain sight of customers is just irresponsible and lazy.",

It will likely remain my favorite, but I was incredibly embarrassed last night when bringing friends from the UK there for dinner after talking the place up so much. The service was WAY off, although the food was still excellent. They recently opened a new location on Sahara, so I'm hoping that this was just a matter of a bunch of trainees not knowing what they were doing (everyone looked new and got orders wrong, not providing place settings until after food was already served, not knowing which tables ordered what food, etc.).  Here's hoping that's all it was. I still suggest everyone give them a chance, as the actual food will not disappoint!",

Really bumping on a Thursday night.  It looked like a lot of 30 somethings come here for date night.  Definitely a good atmosphere. We tried to order all of the rolls that sounded spicy because that's our thing. Everything we tried was really good, just not quite spicy enough for me.  My favorite roll was the Volcano roll.  Good value for the AYCE price of $26. Will definitely return and be sure to request extra spice.  Still haven't found anything better than Sin City for AYCE.",

When the orders started to slowly come, they kept mixing our food with the table next to ours and vice versa the entire time.

The menu is excellent, and by that I mean I have many choices, in fact too many that on my second visit here, I think i have only tried an eight of their items. Quality and freshness of their seafood are outstanding, and I've had them on roll, sushi, and sashimi.  The stand-outs are: Miso soup, Ahi Poke, Shrimp tempura, Calamari, Surf and Turf, Eel and Avocado, Creme Brulee.... food is four stars hands down.  Now, the service is not the most accommodating, I'm afraid to say. Some cons on my last visit: our waiter forgot our three orders of Calamari and had to be reminded, as we waited for a good twenty minutes, grave sin on customer service definitely. For the pros, we were greeted and seated very quickly and our drinks were refilled readily and I appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized for making us wait on our calamaris. In the end, I would give them three stars and believe that they could do better by following up with an order.",

The AYCE prices are $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner.  The AYCE not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.   My Top Picks for AYCE: -Ahi Poke -Kamikaze Roll -Tiger Roll -Rainbow Roll -Rib Eye Steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz) -Mussels (2 comes in every order) -Vanilla Berry Parfait   Oyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  The service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  I've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  My only qualms with Oyshi is that they tend to play rave/techno music there that does not match the ambiance.  And they also automatically add gratuity or parties of 6 or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of 8-9 or more.",

I've never had anything there that I did not enjoy. The atmosphere is nice for a date.

Maybe I'm sentimental, but now that I don't live in the area anymore, I sometimes find myself craving the sushi here.

The menu is very big and definitely worth it if you are going to eat at least 3 rolls. Plus, you get the option of ordering appetizers and other sides. The only down side to Oyshi is the time it takes to bring out your food. Other sushi places in town are very quick to get orders to the table. I went a second time hoping it was just an off night in the kitchen but the service was still incredibly slow. We were at our table for 10 minutes before anyone came to greet us, which is annoying but the food here is worth the wait I suppose.",

It is more of a social sushi spot rather than the one we are used to; which is a more private one, but it was good! It is small, but very comfortable! Highly recommended and enjoyable ..",

We all got to try many things on the all you can eat. Everything was good. We ordered salmon and tuna sashimi off the regular menu also and it tasted fresh and really delicious.   We got dessert too, our two friends ordered the green tea tiramisu and green tea creme brulee, they both liked it, I got the ice cream which was also good.   We would recommend it and would go again, I'm not sure why the bad reviews from others.",

It appears the Sahara location will have other menu options which is odd since they are owned by the same owner, but it may that they have different nightly specials.   I really liked the quail egg sushi. It is a raw egg, but it tastes sunny side up egg which is perfect since I love egg yolk! I have heard that this place has horrible sushi, but it wasn't bad at all. I did not like their special of the day which was negotori (I'm not sure if that's correctly). When we looked it up, it said it was fatty tuna. When it did arrive, it was not solid and the rice tasted heavily of sesame oil. They did have white tuna,   I do love that they also have a other options like their steak, surf and turf, spicy pork. I usually like to order a ton of appetizers and non sushi. Their tempera batter was okay. It wasn't as crispy and crunchy as I would have liked. It was the same thing with the calamari.    I did not like the green tea tiramisu. It was very very wet. I do not like that you are only allowed to order one dessert per person.",

This place is awesome.    The locals know where to eat.  And its not on the strip with over priced and under flavored eats.  Its far away from it HA!  The place is well decorated.  Very modern.  Very clean.  However, you don't get the True, authentic feel of a real japanese sushi bar.  But their ways was cool too :)  Anyway,  their fish was above average as far as freshness.  Their rice was tastey but couldve been a little bit more warmer.    I love the fact that they didn't make their nigiri with so much rice like other places would.  That was a plus:)  I'm not a fan of rolls.  However, my company tonight ordered a few rolls.  I prefer strictly nigiri.  But the ones my friend chose was actually ok.  My friend always takes us out to his spots.  He is totally my go to guy for good eats here in sin city.  He hasn't disappoint:)",

We walked in and the hostess did not even make eye contact with us and then went to seat a couple.  We then asked a server if we could just seat ourselves at the empty bar.  He said yes.  After we seat ourselves the hostess comes over to say that we aren't allowed to seat ourselves and the waitress will be mad at her and we will have to wait a while.  I told her that we could leave if they were too busy to help us (the restaurant was almost empty.). I then after being in the restaurant business myself for over 13 years told her to tell the waitress to suck it up (aka piss off) if she was going to be mad at her for us being sat there.  She leaves and another lady comes to us and says we are not allowed to sit down without being seated.  We got up and left.",

    "text": "For $21 (lunch) or $26 (dinner) you can indulge in all you can eat sushi and sides. The difference between lunch and dinner is that lunch excludes oysters and something else they list on the front of the menu. Aside from that, you can indulge in any roll or hot item. Sashimi's off limits.   Keep in mind that the rolls, regular priced, run for about $13 each so you might as well pay the $26 the ayce option and sample as much as you feel like... unless you're one of those freaks that can eat ONE roll and be satisfied...   The catch to the rolls was as I suspected- tons of rice. One roll was so loaded that I felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. The sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. Oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from.   It seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and ahi poke salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. Or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew.   There are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) Bring friends and share all four. The mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but I can imagine it was a refreshing treat. I had the creme brulee and my friend had the green tiramisu. Both were absolutely wonderful. The green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. Creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet.   The only qualm I have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. All of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. It became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything.   Luckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!",

I'm not really a fan for rolls. The food runner finally gave us sushi and didn't even know what was what.   Food runner: Heres your octopus... Me: Thats not octopus.  Food runner: oh sorry, red snapper.  Me: That's not red snapper.  Food runner: Ohh.... *walks away...   It was actually surf clam. Learn your sea creatures if your going to work at a sushi place!   The sushi was not fresh. All of them were small and slightly fishy. The uni was literally orange brown and tasted so weird I couldn't eat it.   I think then only thing I enjoyed was the miso soup.

This is literally the worst service I have ever encountered.   Sat down for Ayce lunch at 1:30.. Our first order of Nigiri hadn't came out, it was now 1:55. We didn't order anything special, just slice the fish and send it out. We ask the server about our order. She abruptly leaves, and I can see the sushi chef and the server arguing with each other.  She then advised us that she forgot to put the order in. I thought, ok.. Cool. The world isn't a perfect place, and we all make mistakes... But when we make a mistake, a good server should hurry to correct it and make it right.   Waited 20 min... low and behold, she forgot to put the order in a second time. It has now been 45 min since I ordered the Nigiri.. No exaggeration. By this time I've lost my appetite. The restaurant isn't even busy, the place was half full.  I felt disgusted paying the $47 plus $10 tip.. I tipped 20 percent just because I'm in the tipping industry, and don't have the heart to stiff this chick. She also told me they don't do half rolls. I could have sworn they did before.  I will never come back to this establishment. Thanks server with the black sketcher shoes.",

    "text": "Now I don't know how many check-in's I have on Yelp, but I've been here a fair amount of times to know what is good and what is bad about this place. This was the first AYCE sushi place I've been to here in the valley and it's not in my top 3 places. To sum it up, Oyshi is so hit or miss that it's almost a risk to come here. Yes, you'll come here see that there's a long wait and expect it to be great but the last few times I've been here and given chance after chance, I've left disappointed.   First of all, I used to work in a restaurant. Server's know when it's busy, trust me, and as a customer I expect you to acknowledge that. The times that I've waited for a decent amount of time, I've never been apologized to about the wait or been given an explanation when the rolls I've ordered don't come out when it seems like people who just sat down are getting there's before me.   I'm not that selfish, but I just feel like the service here is poorly conducted. I've felt that it takes a group of us to look around constantly before someone comes and asks if we need anything. The rolls are always very good, but the amount of time that it takes most times I'm there is not average to the sushi places I've been to.   I will admit I do love their Salmon Nigiri and the Love Affair roll but a lot of the other rolls often feel like there is just too much going on. I don't like to complain, but the service isn't up to my standards and my standards aren't extremely high. I just expect my water to be refilled within a decent time and asked if I'd like to order more without having to ask to order more.   I am very forgiving and I will come here, I just don't have the expectations that I once did. The sushi is usually very fresh and the options aside from the sushi are great. I always order the calamari and the surf-n-turf appetizers when I come here. I would recommend this place to a friend, I think I would just advise them to be go-getters with their servers and make it known when they want something. All in all, if someone said they were coming here tomorrow, I'd probably join them. Cheers!",

They also play EDM music and have sports showing on the flat screens near the bar. All postitives in my eyes. I always sit at the bar, so the service is good. Normally I can just order directly from the sushi chef without waiting for a waiter. That really speeds up the ordering process. I can't speak to the service when seated anywhere else in the restaurant.  One disappointing thing about Oyshi is that it doesn't offer seafood salad on the AYCE menu. That automatically prevents it from a five star review in my eyes. On the bright side, the amount of fish on the nigiri sushi is ample. Very high fish to rice ratio. I also like the variety of desserts offered. You're not limited to the usual mochi or ice cream. Oyshi also offers creme brulee and a berry parfait. The berry parfait is my usual and it's a must have.",

The service is decent but the sushi is just not as delicious as it used to be. My last to go order, the rolls were very heavily overloaded with rice, over cooked rice, so much that both rolls were falling apart as soon as I opened the to go box. I'm a sushi addict and I know that some places that offer AYCE overload the rolls with rice to fill you up but it's very disappointing when you are paying al a carte prices at $30 for 2 rolls and you have to pull so much rice off it and still can't enjoy it. I order to go from other places like Sawa, Ojah, Goyemon and Kyara and have never had this problem with them. Also, the shrimp tempura was mushy, the tuna didn't taste fresh... I could go on and on. Sadly wouldn't recommend Oyshi, plenty of other places to eat at.",

All we ordered we poke bowls but it took about 15 mins to actually get it. Then we ordered 3 rolls and the restaurant wasn't even busy but it took them at least 20 mins...   Also I wouldn't drink their water. Had a very metallic and off putting taste to it. No bueno. And their nigiri is very small! I was surprised at the amount of rice they had with each piece of nigiri! The rolls did taste good, they were just smaller compared to other rolls at other sushi restaurants.",

For $25ish, its a steal of a deal just based on the cost basis of California style sushi at any other restaurant.  And that my friends, is all we came here for.  If you have read any of my other Japanese restaurant reviews, you know that this is not my cup of tea so please don't unfollow me; the lady wanted to eat Cali style sushi so what the lady wants, the lady gets.   Here is the fat skinny on this place: if you stick to just the sushi rolls, you will be satisfied. Lets do the math: the average price for a Cali style roll at any given sushi joint will run you about $10 so assuming you eat at least 2 rolls, then you will eat your money's worth.  The rolls were decent but nothing spectacular. As mentioned previously I prefer the purist motherland style sushi.   Notable misses for this place: 1. They charge extra for sashimi 2. Most of the cooked food is not very good. The steak did not taste good and the sizzling platter was loaded with onions as fluff.   The gf was happy she got her Japanese lasagna and spider rolls so all in all an -ok dining experience I guess...",

My favorite are the Double Screaming O & Tiger rolls, but also enjoy the Love Affair, Oh My Heart & The Kamakzi! We used to always eat the Spicy Tuna Crunch but stopped only because we try to avoid eating deep fried food all together. It's worth a cheat though! Dynamite Roll is another! Quite honestly, there's not much here that we've tried that we haven't absolutely loved. The hot tea is the perfect end to your meal with the dessert options included with the AYCE! Crime brulee (my only complaint is they keep downsizing it, it's become about 2 bite dessert...maybe it's a 100 calorie choice) the green tea tiramisu is my current favorite!! Whatever you do, get AYCE & start trying different rolls. You won't be disappointed.  And finally the chefs & wait staff...what can I say, they're phenomenal!",

    "text": "Hmmm...I was planning to lose my AYCE sushi virginity to Ms. Goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead I opted for the next girl available named Ms. Oyshi....I'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and I'm still saving myself for the former.    For 26 bucks, I think it's definitely in line with Sushi Goyemon, but I happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so I was able to get some perspective as I proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  The first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:  1. No sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough  2. No excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  The rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  Of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.  3.  Any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"I'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans  4. The jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the AYCE orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  Wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  Either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   I don't even like jalapeno poppers but I almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.  THE MEAL  The appetizers  (ahi poke, spicy sashimi salad, and miso soup)  The poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the sashimi salad was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the miso soup was surprisingly not overly salty as I anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.  The \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.  The nigiri:  I sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something I couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  I'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.  The rolls:  Perhaps I've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that I couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the Seinfeld episode where George tries to catch the Twix bar candy thief (\"It's a SETUP! They're all Caterpillar rolls!!\")  I would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)  Last but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  So you're telling me I could have drank an entire gallon of miso soup instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  Perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the Emperor's garden, but I would appreciate a warning next time.    3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but I'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me Goyemon is better.",

    "text": "Oyshi used to be my favorite AYCE sushi spot.  They had a wide variety of quality rolls, great tasting food, consistent service, and a really nice atmosphere that made for a great spot to have pre-game Friday night dinner.   Although the sushi is still pretty good, the service and management has gone off the deep end and because of this, I don't think I'll ever eat at Oyshi again.  There are too many quality sushi restaurants in Las Vegas to justify returning to Oyshi where the last few visits, all I seem to get are orders that never show up, drinks that never get filled, waiters that refuse to come to our table or our spot at the bar (even though it's obvious that you've seen me flag you down), and servers/staff that are increasingly bitter and unfriendly.    This stuff matters. Oddly enough, it's also the stuff that is easiest to fix. When you've already got quality menu items, quality sushi chefs, and quality sushi rolls that people rave about - why are you letting your terrible servers and management ruin your restaurant?  If I'm sitting at the sushi bar and I'm trying to order more beer and sake, why are people refusing to help me out? If I want to give you my money in exchange for some-what overpriced alcohol, why does it take more than 20 minutes for someone to take my drink order and then another 20 to bring me a couple of beers and sake? This should never be an issue with a sushi restaurant.  Never. Sure, AYCE places get really busy and I totally understand that. But, if you can't handle the heat - hire more servers.   I shouldn't have to wait more than 45 minutes for my order. And when my order does come out, half of it shouldn't be missing. It also shouldn't take you another 30 minutes to bring out the pieces missing from my order. And you shouldn't have an attitude with customers just because they are asking for the items they originally ordered that are missing because you either forgot to put the orders in or there was a mix up in the kitchen. I am never rude to waiters or management and this last experience at Oyshi was no exception. I was pleasant and more than patient and if I still can't get someone to so much as offer an apology for missing orders/missing drinks and for treating me like I was more of a burden than a customer bringing a lot of business to the establishment, then I will happily take my business elsewhere.   Sorry, Oyshi, it was good while it lasted!",

I don't think I've ever waited for 20mins for a table. The food is always good. Everything I've ever had their is yummy! They added a sizzling plate which I really enjoyed. They have a couple ppl that walk around just to clear your table which is awesome. Your table is never cluttered.",

My group definitely has to order a lot of sushi at once to compensate for the wait time in between orders.  The environment is amazing. It's definitely the most up to date sushi restaurant in Las Vegas. I'm judging by the actual wall decor to the house music played.  My favorite dish would have to be A Lobster Affair. If you don't have a shellfish allergy give this dish a try.",

Beef asparagus is especially tasty. The rolls are similar to what to get anywhere else. So is are the nigiri. I think the bonsai roll is very good. Spicy tuna inside with Cajun albacore outside. Probably the best roll we had. The biggest thing is the green tea creme brulee. No other AYCE sushi place has this. It is so good!!!! Without it I'd probably give 3 stars.

Locals drive from the North (about 30-40 minutes away) just to eat here.  Sushi is fresh and tasty. Get the Nuclear Bomb and the Heart Attack! Even the dessert is good. Get the creme brulee!  If you go for dinner, make sure to choose all you can eat, otherwise you'll be paying buckos! All You Eat menu is anything except sashimi. As of this writing, $26 for All you can eat dinner, $21 for lunch. It will be worth your money.  Waitstaff is casual and easygoing. They play EDM music in the background which keeps the atmosphere upbeat and fun.   Only reason not a 5 star is because there usually is a wait. Everytime we've gone, we have had to wait 20-30 minutes for a table.   But it's always been worth the wait!  4 stars for us!",

Now you would expect low quality from somewhere like this, but it is actually pretty decent in some respects.  However, it is also lacking in areas.  Pros: The price was the norm for this type of establishment.  The food is good.  I'm not a big time roll eater as I'd rather eat nigiri over some American take on sushi.  The nigiri was of decent quality, not outstanding, but hey, it is the desert after all. The appetizers are great!  Yes you can make a meal out of the appetizers.  The sauce on the surf and turf was outstanding.  The tempura dipping sauce was also great.  Cons:  First of all, this place has gotten very busy.  I used to be able to walk right in, now it can be up to a 45 minute wait.  Once you get in you get the feel that this place is understaffed.  (Update!!!  Staff seems to have increased, speed of orders has improved....some.  Still a packed house.)  The servers come around, yet your order does not.  I came with a group of 7 big time eaters and we put in big orders at a time.  Not only did our orders take forever to come out, but it felt like the manager was watching us to see if we were really eating all that food.  It got to a point that they stopped taking our order.  It says all you can eat on the door buddy.  (Update:  Management does not do that to us anymore, are they reading this?  Great job if they are!)  They didn't even bring out our oysters and claimed that they did and we could not have any more.  I had to explain to the manager that we are not asking for more, we never got any to begin with.  They figured out that our oysters were taken to the wrong table.  Lucky them.  We ended up paying the bill and leaving having not received everything we ordered. They couldn't even take the time to fill a drink.  UPDATE:  The last few times we went we got better service, the rotation of fish is fast, so the flavor has improved.  Still not the fastest, and still a wait to get in, but it's a slamming busy place now.  I have found one big dislike that is totally not the restaurant's fault.  Every time I go there now, there always seems to be the loudest, most obnoxious, cussing, group of trendy punks sitting right next to me.  It's like man, if you've got all this money that you seem to need to yell about so everyone can hear you, why are you at an AYCE sushi place.  Go eat at some rich place where everyone else is yelling about their car and their money.  I don't want to hear you, I want to hear the person sitting next to me.",

I have tried this place three times and each time I have gone there the service was so HORRIBLE that I will NEVER go back. It took me 15 minutes for me to even have someone come greet my table and another 15 min to order. Now I would understand the long wait if it was around lunch or dinner time but this was at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. When I finally ordered it took about another 45 minutes to even get my salad and sushi. They forgot some of my order and at this point I was done. The second time I went I was there for dinner and the same thing happend but a longer wait! The manager came over and took off our salad which only cost us 4.00, I would assume for such bad service that they would have tried to make us a little more happy but comp'ing off one salad was no acceptable. I will never go back there and I advise you all not to either!",

The reason I only gave a 4 star is because the quality of service has dropped. Largely due to the fact that it has gotten so much busier. There are more waiters but they do not tend to the customers fast enough. The food is great, but for an all-you-can-eat spot, you will enjoy the large menu they offer. The food is always fresh because of the amount of traffic they had. You can find your favorite server and request them to serve you.. Usually requesting anyone to serve you in particular will encourage them to serve you better. I am sure everyone was expecting my 4 star rating to be all positive but I've gone to Oyshi since it opened and I understand the restaurant has grown from what it originally was. The service has dropped a little but they still offer you great food for a great price.",

The sushi is fresh, the steaks and meats are tender and juicy, and the appetizers like the gyoza and seaweed salad are tasty. The calamari could use some work in the flavor department however. The service there is second to none. You are greeted when you walk in by nearly all of the staff, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive, and the bus staff makes sure your table isn't cluttered with plates and your drinks are never empty. The wait for the sushi can get a little long, so order up some appetizers and sides while you're waiting. Just remember that there are other tables waiting for sushi, and only a few sushi chefs to make all the sushi so patience is a virtue here.",

    "text": "Finally went to Oyshi yesterday (as it was recommended by my friend).  The atmosphere was pretty awesome.  They had a spacious seating arrangement, colorful decor, Xgames and the Laker's Game on TV, and Techno music playing in the background (not really what I had expected in a Sushi joint).  We came for the AYCE @ about $22.00 for dinner.  It's decently priced for AYCE.  The price does not include a drink.  The selection of food on the menu was pretty good.  They had a good assortment of appetizers, specialty rolls, and traditional Nigiri (not to mention hand cut Maki rolls).  I am a big fan of Sashimi, but like 99% of the time, the Sashimi is not included in the AYCE.  I did however stock up on the Sake (raw Salmon) Nigiri.  Being my favorite Nigiri, I found their Sake Nigiri to be very very fresh.  It was super bright orange and tasted incredible!  For dessert, they have a few different flavors of Mochi, but you can only get one.  If I remember correctly, the flavors are as follows: Green Tea, Mango, and Red Bean.  I opted for the Mango and wish I could have had a second since they were pretty small in size.  Anyhow, the Sake Nigiri alone would have gotten Oyshi 4 stars, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow.  On top of that, the only soup available was the Miso Soup.  How do you not have Udon on the AYCE menu?  Seriously?? They also did not have low-sodium soy sauce (I know it still has like 800mg per tbsp , but that's better than 1000mg).  Overall, I'd come here again... I just hope my server can keep my water cup filled.",

This is after 3 tables finished and left and they seated 6 more ppl. Do you know how much longer? No but I can ask... another 15 min. The kitchen is backed up. Me: Can you get them to put a rush? No, there's nothing I can do about it. Me: Is there a manager? No, they don't come in till 5 or 6 pm. Wait another 10 min, she finally brings my food. No sorry for the wait, no offer to take care better if we come back, just a \"here you go\".  Get home and guess what? California rolls have no cucumber. WTF... never again.",

Most often, my roommates and I just roll up after one of us so much as mentions sushi.  The food is delicious and extremely fresh. I'm from New York where all-you-can-eat sushi is unheard of--and would be pretty suss if you did hear of it. Less than $30 for seafood? What, was it fished out of Hudson River?  Sashimi platters are the only thing on the menu that isn't AYCE. Dessert, however, is. I highly recommend their chocolate creme brulee! For apps, you must try their Ahi Poke.  I'm partial to their Shrimp Tempura hand rolls, which I can, and have, eaten 3-4 of in one sitting. Other favorites include: Kami-Kaze, Oh My Heart, and Lobster Fair. If you like nigiri, you should check the chalkboard when you come in for the daily specials.   Pro Tip: If you sit at the bar, you can order half-rolls! It's a great way to try more rolls if you're like me and have limited tummy space, but eyes bigger than your stomach.",

I ordered off the Sushi menu which i have done before. My total came to $8.65 which seemed reasonable for two basic sushi rolls (salmon and spicy tuna)  What I received was literally 4 bites (see photo) So disappointed! Went back in to ask the girl in front if there had been a mix up. She informed me that i ordered off the \"nigiri menu\"  It was the menu she handed me and said sushi on the top -_-  That being said, the two stars are for the salmon \"nigiri\" which was a tasty two bites, and the ponzu sauce  Definitely will not be returning to this place unless they fix the menu and stop overcharging :/",

The waitress sat me in a booth with a stack of dirty dishes sitting right next to me in the booth next to me. I looked at her like she was crazy, waiting to see when she would move the soiled disgusting dishes. They stayed there my entire meal. I think I pretty much mentally tuned out after that, but my water glass was constantly empty. I drink a ton of water with my meals. Everything took forever to come and the bill, of course, took forever as well. There are too many sushi places in Vegas to come back to this one to be grossed out having to sit next to dirty dishes my ENTIRE meal.  Service is an F minus. If I were rating the food this place would get 3 stars.",

    "text": "This was my second visit. After reading those frightening November reviews of food poisoning I was very leery about returning. I think Alice W was more angry about the service and used the F.P. card. I've never heard of a whole family getting food poisoning so take that review with a grain of salt.    My first time was good, I just did not write about it. Today I went for lunch and had a great experience. They have a few new rolls and I tried 3 of them. They were all beautifully executed and tasted great.   I'm usually not a fan of ponzu sauce but the Iris roll**** off the new menu was so good I had 2 of them. It had  Spicy albacore with cucumber, wrapped with avocado, and seared tuna. My eating partner in crime loved it.   Screaming Roll****shrimp tempura roll wrapped with yum-yum cajun albacore and avocado with garlic ponzu sauce. Flavor of cajun albacore was awesome.   Love Affair roll ***shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. This was good, but came in last of all the other rolls.   Asian skirt steak*** is served teriaki style on a sizzling mini skillet. It was a nice addition to sushi.  Service was better than average. I always sit at the sushi bar. Here you order from a waiter instead of directly from sushi chefs. My waiter was attentive, I had enough H2O to drink and never had to wait on food or ordering more of it.   The AYCE is $21.00 per person and well worth it. I wish they offered fried rice but there are lots of items offered on their menu.  I will return to Oyshi as it is the best sushi that is close to my house.",

My friend and I tried Oyshi and I think this place gives Yama a run for the money. Things that stood out is the raw oysters and surf n turf.  All the sushi was good for ayce style, and the rice was in the nigiri wasn't hard and didn't fall apart like other ayce places. The negative aspects was that the service was a little slow for me, and they brought me one piece of yellow tail that looked like it had been sun bathing out back for the afternoon. Otherwise this place is great, and I'll be returning soon.",

    "text": "Oyshi used to be one of my favorite binge eating locales, however the last time I went was an utter letdown.   What differentiated Oyshi from other \"All-you-can-eat\" sushi spots was the quality of the fish. What used to be fresh, now looks and tastes old. Basically, all of the nigiri sushi was disgusting; uni being the worst.   The cooked food is still good (hence two stars instead of one), but its \"All-you-can-eat SUSHI\", not \"All-you-can-eat-tempura-edamame-teriyaki-skewers\".   Would I go back? Probably not. I'd rather spend $5 more and go to a real buffet like the M Resort. At least you know the sushi is going to be sub par there and gravitate towards the other entrees.",

Server had attitude from the beginning - my sense is a combination of being annoyed by the questions, that we all didn't get AYCE and I was the only one drinking .  We were told the problem was the kitchen was backed up .... Really ?  More like the kitchen was fucked up and the server was backed up and someone needed to stick their foot up her ass to cleanse her of the crappy attitude.  The food ?  Gotta admit the sushi was good - sweet shrimp, garlic tuna and Cajun tuna as well as the yellowtail were the stars.  Unagi also worked for me.  The hot dishes ?  The ones we actually got ? Calamari, popcorn scallops, asparagus beef ... Very average.  There were at least 5 dishes they never brought us.  This was a very rare occasion I didn't tip much - $95 bill, $2 tip.  Get it together OYSHI !",

The best part about this place are the appetizers. I love the Shrimp on skewers, Rib Eye, Asian Skirt Steak, Ahi Poke, Gyoza, and many more....Over the years their portions have gotten smaller, but i understand because it prevents from wasting food..BTW you can always get more....Their fresh sushi is amazing as well, big pieces of fish with small rice, and their Baked Rolls are very tasty. my favorites is the Lobster Fair and the Paradise rolls. Word of advice try to get there early around 5 for dinner, or you can expect a long wait. Service is really good, and ambiance is great with a younger japanese themed feel....Oyshi is the only reason my wife wants to go to Vegas...",

Our server Steven (maybe spelled Stephen) was very nice and paid special attention to us and started up real conversations about UNLV and stuff.  There was only 2 of us and we had to re-order/ask about a couple of things we ordered (same as when we were there with the big group), but it wasn't a big deal because since there was only 2 of us, we got full way faster and were glad to use the digestion breaks between eating.  The creme brulee was divine as always. It's just SO SAD how they only give you 1 dessert when you order AYCE (All You Can Eat) sushi. I want AYCE creme brulee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And still came home smelling like food. LOL.  #foodcrew",

The last few times I've been to town, I've gone to Oyshi Sushi. It's conveniently close to my folks' house. Oyshi has two different set-ups. One is AYCE (All you can eat) and the other is A la carte. I've done both. The service and staff are good, the place is clean, and the prices are average. The sushi is good but not spectacular and the portions aren't as meaty as I'd prefer.

    "text": "On our search for another epic place for sushi happens to fall onto this place as it drew us in for AYCE. I think a few of our friends had heard or were recommended to try this joint since they knew our group and how we can grub. The last place we went to before left a bad taste in my mouth and another a little ill from the meal, we were happy to try a completely different place.   The atmosphere, ambience, are very inviting yet dark for those intimate encounters due to the dark wood finish everywhere. TVs around for those ackward silent moments if you're on a date or deep conversation in a larger group. I do like the mural on the back wall which was really impressive.  Now, down to the food, you can order anything on the menu but just watch for any restrictions such as only 1 order of uni for example. I do like the sound of appetizers you can order such as rib-eye steak which is really less than tapas on a sizzling plate and a bed of cabbage and onions. Another beef plate was the same which tasted good but I feel like I would have to order 5 of these to really make a good size order to be called an appetizer.   The rolls are inventive and decorative which is a refreshing change from the other sushi places. My recommendation is to stick to the \"designer\" rolls rather than the sushi. I must strongly advise against ordering the uni which it could be me and an off night. I always try to be brave and order it knowing it could be really good or it could be really really bad. In fact, I didn't eat the second piece because the first one I ate tasted like iodine for some reason. Definitely may explain for my stomach pains on the way back to our place. Nausea may be another descriptive word for this feeling as well. The rolls taste great and presentation looks great but I may have to say no to sushi so far away from the coastline especially in the middle of the dessert. If you have reviewed or about to review this place and give it 5 stars, you may have to check yourself as your taste buds are a bit off for what great sushi really should be in quality.",

Plus we always sit at the sushi bar so you don't have to wait for a waitress to bring it to you :) There is usually a short wait but I've never waited more than 15minutes even on a Saturday night. ...

Pros: 1. decent selection of rolls, sashimi, appetizers for the buffet option 2. friendly service  Cons: 1. No sweet shrimp or uni (sea urchin) for lunch buffet (dinner only) 2. Dynamite roll had wayyyy too much mayo which was gross 3. No all you can eat dessert!? Wanted some more of that strawberry mochi!  Recommendations: I'd choose the skirt steak over the other steaks. Yellow halibut is awesome (don't get the baby halibut as it is bland). Any of their rolls is decent but nothing really stood out to me in particular.  Definitely worth coming back for the lunch special",

Not fresh at all.....The sushi rice was obviously pre-made (main inside rolls w/ the crab n sushi rice that comes under the fish) meaning that they mass produce the main parts of the sushi- refrigerate it and then just added the fish and toppings after the fact. The rice was sooo cold that when you were eating it, it felt like you were eating ice cream with warm sushi toppings. I know this place is busy but when a place moves in that direction to get people in n out not good;(  Very sad that this restaurant is cutting corners like that, especially with sushi.

    "text": "When I went, I think they were only open for a few months. My friends really liked this joint and said I had to check it out.   The food was decent. Although we ordered salmon and got lox. Which I guess if technically salmon. Just not very Japanesey. They also didn't have negi-toro or shiso leaves or white tuna. Shiso is a very basic requirement!   Ergonomically mediocre. Like the counters are too deep ... for a sushi bar. The decor was still coming up. There was a ugly mural on the wall. Although, I did like the little pieces leading up to the bathroom, like little Basquiat post cards.   The sushi chefs were also quarreling behind the sushi bar. Our servers weren't very warm, but got the job done. They were all boys. I think half of them were from Hawai'i. Not that you have to be Japanese to know how to slice a mean sushi ... but it didn't seem these kids had much formal training. Just sayin' ...   * off the strip, non-casino",

    "text": "Another AYCE sushi joint in Vegas.  I swear there are one in every two blocks.  Bigger than most, this place is usually busy at night but very chill during earlier hours like  most places.  But when it's busy, it's really busy which leads to service sucking!  But overall the atmosphere inside is pretty good and seats up large group of people which is good for birthday dinners or just a bunch of friends coming from out of town.  All you can eat I believe was $25 for dinner.  I'm just gonna point out what I like and usually order. Baked mussels, dynamite roll, volcano roll, nigiri is not as tasty here, oysters are the best I've had in Vegas but unfortunately only 4 per person so get your friends to order it as well even if they don't eat it so you can have it, surf and turf (highly recommended), and for dessert the fruit parfait.   This is not a quiet place for dinner so bad idea for a date if you plan on having a meal with a quiet conversation.  People come here often with their kids and big groups of people, which shouldn't surprise you are very loud.  This place is a hit or miss but fortunately I'm patient when it comes to bad service when it's excusable because of how busy this place can be at times.",

AYCE, but sitting at the sushi bar we were not allowed to order from the sushi chef, the waitress would take the order, then reach in front of us and hand the slip to the chef.  Sushi was okay, but I won't be back.  The waitress was condescending in attitude, not sure what they were going for-",

There were many servers there on a Monday night and the place wasn't super busy. They kept forgetting about us and not once did anyone ask if everything was ok. We did the AYCE deal and after I finished a roll it would be like, 15 minutes before anyone asked for our next order. A few times we had to pester the bus boys to get our server because they were the only staff that was coming around. I saw the server at the table next to us check on them twice before anyone came to us even once. I understand if it's crazy busy and people are ordering sushi like it's going out of style, but I kept looking up at the servers standing around at the bar doing nothing but looking confused. Maybe they didn't know who had our table, I don't know. After we were done with our dessert we just sat there for another 10-15 minutes waiting for our check. Again, we had to literally get up out of our seats to find someone.  Any time I've done AYCE at other places, even busier places like Goyemon, the service has been fine. This was bad service to the point of being extreme.  Come on Oyshi, step it up! I really really like your sushi!",

    "text": "I found this place perusing Yelp sometime back in 2010. AYCE lunch $21, dinner $26 which is comparable to similar places. Ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. Always do AYCE. The main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places Ive visited. I counted and cant even believe Ive tried 12 different AYCE sushi spots in Vegas to date. Im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. I like to say Im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. So you can take what you want from my review based on that. This place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so I try to frequent at lunch. Service can take longer at times. I typically like to sit at the bar when I sushi. I have experienced faster service that way usually, so now I lean towards sitting at the bar. The ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic. Some items I favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. At every AYCE I go for green tea ice cream and hamachi kama(not on AYCE here) if its available. They do also have brulees, mochi ice cream and parfaits for dessert. All desserts are limited to 1 per cept for ice cream. Dinner AYCE limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most AYCEs. Theres a list of appetizers which I will order from ocassionally but I concentrate more on the sushi and green tea ice cream. :) Is it the freshest and highest quality seafood? No. Its decent. It does say theres a time limit of, 90min I believe? Dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. Ive never been rushed even tho I know I have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. I realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service Ive gotten here, I think you definitely get your moneys worth.",

The staff is young, friendly, and fast paced.     The food comes two ways - ALL YOU CAN EAT or ala carte. I opted for the more modest ala option as I am flying solo.  The food tastes fresh, the presentation lovely, and the delivery onto the plate quite speedy.  My only complaint about the food was that the rolls are packed very tightly...loose rolls aren't awesome.  I can understand how an AYCE would require trading speed for firmness but would rather have the firmness especially via ala carte ordering.   All in all it was a pleasant experience and I will likely return. Four out of five stars for what it is.",

    "text": "Where do I start with this place? First of all, we have been visiting Oyshi for 3-4 years now and have had ours ups and downs. When the owner is not around, the place goes haywire. I will say the quality of food is usually pretty good and when the heavier gentleman is behind the sushi bar, we are treated phenomenally. This is where it ends. There is zero consistency. This evening we arrived around 11:30 PM. There were 6-8 tables seated as well as about 6 people at the sushi bar. We opted to sit at the bar. There were 2 sushi chefs for the entire restaurant so we already assumed the wait time on food would be a bit slow but being that it was so late at night this wasn't a problem. What was a problem was the HORRIBLE service we received. There was a group of what seemed to be off duty employees sitting in the back portion of the bar drinking. The chefs were going over to that side at least every 5 minutes, taking shots and conversing, as tickets sat in front of them. At one point one of the servers had to go through the kitchen and behind the bar to ask a chef for extra sauce. The woman who took our order came back once after 10 minutes and once more after about 25. We placed our order with another server who did not write anything down and alas, forgot 3 of the 4 items we ordered. At this point, visibly bothered, one of the chefs told us to order any sushi through him, which we did. That too was forgotten. We could not even enjoy the $60 dinner we paid for and rushed out of there as to flee a very uncomfortable situation. Unfortunately I think it is time to find a new neighborhood sushi spot as this place clearly allows their employees to run the show which shows in their service.",

It was the day after Mother's day since my dear wife had to work on Mother's day.  We loved pretty much every thing that we ordered. Now like all the all you can eat places in Vegas you can order sashimi but only as sushi and they make you eat everything.  Still at 25 dollars a person and 20 for kids it was well worth what we paid.  If there was one negative it was that at such a small place they still added 18% gratuity onto the bill. I would have tipped much more than that if they didn't add it.  We really loved the Lobster Fair and the Las Vegas Roll. Especially the Las Vegas since it didn't have any rice.  I do think that the staff needs better training. Although they were sweet and charming they did mess up a couple of times on the order. But we did order a lot and there were at least 3 people ordering. I guess I wouldn't have done as well as they did.",

Knowing this, I would just get to go orders and never had any problems with that.   Fast forward about 1 year... I was excited to eat here because I was sure they would have their sh*t together by now. Boy was I wrong... Our first round took FOREVER AND A DAY and our server forgot a couple things I had ordered so I ordered once again. I swear saw her scribbling on her notepad while I was telling her what I would like to eat next.  It is quite possible that she was just jotting things down for the grocery store after her shift. We decided to order dessert from the waitress at the next table so that we could have it right after the rest of the sushi came. So, dessert came and we decided to let the creme brulee sit there on our table until the rest of our sushi came. To our surprise the sushi and our waitress was nowhere to be found!!! A long while later I asked another waitress if she could check on our other sushi orders and she informed is that there were none and she could take our order if we wanted more. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED IN ONE VISIT!!! I tried to give this place another chance and I just feel silly for expecting something better from a place that can't offer anything better than horribly slow service. They deserve NO stars but the sushi that actually made it to the table was okay.  Don't waste your time going here... Drive to Goyemon, SushiMon, or Sushi Twister. I promise, even though the drive is further it'll take even longer to wait around for sushi here.",

We sit down, order our drinks and our first order..all was fine till then.  After we order, a good 10 minutes pass by while I observed the chefs, servers, and tables.   There were about 4 other tables and 3 of them were finished.  The one table next to us seemed to be about midway into their meal which seemed like hours between dishes.  They get one dish, finish it, then wait for another 5 minutes for the server to bring their next order. They looked irritated. And so about 20 minutes of watching 4 or 5 chefs looking busy, we get our first order.  After we finish through our first order we order maybe 4 more orders of nigiri. (Which shouldn't take more than 3 minutes) And by then all tables were gone and about 5 people at the bar. So I expected it to come quick. Nope...20 minutes later we get our last order and by then I was fed up with everything.  There were about 6 servers(why??) and they seemed more excited about talking to each other than even looking to see if the customers were okay.   Nigiri was like 80% rice 20% fish which you can expect from a Korean run sushi restaurant.  And of course they charge you if you leave rice.  How else would they make money? Not by quality, that's for sure.   Overall, the worst experience at an AYCE sushi restaurant.   If you want quality food and service, I'd recommend xtreme sushi.

The restaurant is very cute, decked out in the typical Japanese style (fountains, folding screens) with a modern feel. It could serve well as a date spot or a family dinner outing, based on the groups of people I spotted. While we waited for our take-out order, the host offered us beverages, which was a very nice touch.  I tend to judge restaurants based on how vegetarian- and vegan-friendly they are, and this place definitely passed. There are at least 10 or 12 vegetarian rolls to choose from. I ordered the asparagus and avocado roll, vegetable tempura and miso soup. All of them were very good. The sushi in particular was well-made and tasty, which was surprising considering that this restaurant advertises its All You Can Eat special.   The prices are good, the food is better. We'll be back!",

    "text": "(4.5 stars)  My trip to Vegas would not be complete without a visit to Oyshi Sushi. Though it's off strip, I'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time I'm there.   My last visit was the first time I've done their All You Can Eat deal, and for $26, it was WELL WORTH IT! The only things it DOESN'T include are the Chef's Special Sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. My friends and I went all out and ordered several to share of every course. Oysters were delicious and baked mussels (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. Tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. My favorite salad is their ahi poke on top of seaweed salad - YUM! We shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. Again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. The mochi ice cream is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! We also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.  Service is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. As with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! They did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.  If you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, Oyshi is the place to go!",

We went for lunch so it was a $21 price.  But if you figure most of the rolls I liked cost about $10-$12 anyways, 2 rolls and you are there.  Plus it's your choice of different things from the menu, not just sushi.  But there are rules, and not EVERYTHING on the menu is part of the AYCE.  There is a bit of lag time on getting your food, so don't go running in thinking you are going to be out in 15 minutes.  But do go with the expectation of enjoying the company you went with.  Our server was great and the food was really good.",

The only thing you can't order is from the sashimi menu and your limited to 1 dessert item.  The menu is abundant and creative.   We ordered...  Appetizers Oysters - so fresh and delicious! Tuna Poke - mixed with seaweed salad and oh so good. Sirloin steak teryaki - sizzling right off the hot plate, very tender. Sushi rolls Losbter Fair - scrumptious! My Favorite - scallops, variety of fish, topped in eel sauce. Yellowtail trio - fresh hamachi mixed with a ginger sauce. Dessert Green tea terimisu - to die for!  It's made with marscapone cheese, it's smooth consistency just melts in your mouth!",

Most buffets start out strong then lose its luster over time. This place is getting there.  I noticed my sushi was packed with a lot of rice. I was kinda full upon ordering the second round but that didn't stop me.  Also the sweet shrimp was a little fishy but it didn't cause any havoc to my tummy.

Disappointed that we couldn't order half rolls, only full rolls. So we couldn't try a variety of sushi because we got full fast. It's ok, the sushi all seemed the same. The creme brulee was good, most memorable part of the experience. The green tea tiramisu someone got was ok. Didn't like how you can only order one dessert but unlimited ice cream. Got too full to try the ice cream. Their rules are weak compared to sushi mon or Yama sushi. Would not come back. I didn't think it was worth it.",

I'd read some of the earlier reviews about poor service, but I have to say there was no trouble at all when I was there. The waiter (Vincent) was very attentive and friendly. He answered questions about menu items that we asked about and commented on his favorites. There were two other people that kept coming around and filling our water glasses whenever they got low. Food came out fast and was delicious!!!  I had the \"Oh My Heart\", the \"Hawaiian\" and the \"Lobster Fair\". All were exceptional!! I could have ordered 3 of the Oh My Hearts and been perfectly happy - it was awesome!! The last one I ate (Lobster Fair) was almost too big but very tasty!  Oh My Heart - Spicy Tuna, Crab Mix, Avocado and Shrimp Tempura rolled in Soy Paper. Eat this!!",

In short: the food and quality of it is amazing, not sub par by any means. I highly suggest their nigiri as well as their Red Dragon and Crazy Philly roll. Their ahi poke is fresh and the bed of seaweed salad it's placed in is on point.  However, the service (today at least) was below average. It's understandable if a waiter is slammed with tables, if errands for sushi bar needs to run, miscommunication with orders happen ---shit happens and waitressing is a tough job. But when you don't even bother to check your tables on the way of running food or when you're plain MIA for the duration of our longer than expected stay---It's simply no bueno. Our waiter Josh was sweet and was probably jam packed with errands but when it comes to an hr wait for the check let alone dessert orders...well hmm :/   Still love this place but maybe perhaps don't understaff?",

    "text": "I cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! Usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing Trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. I almost felt like I was in San Francisco.  I ordered the seaweed salad. It was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. The seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used. Then i ordered the Hawaiian roll with soy paper. It had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a Cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. Seriously one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had and I consider myself a sushi connoisseur.  The popcorn scallops are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce.  I had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! Amazing deal especially for the quality. Ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and Ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. LOVE LOVE LOVE!  Oh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)",

The seaweed salad was probably my favorite appetizer...   The place is a quite overpriced for the food.

I like the decor of the place and the music playing makes it feel kind of clubby haah. Our waitress was nice to let us switch from the table to the bar so we could get our orders in faster. We all stuffed our faces full of sushi. Large selection of sushi to choose from so you should find something you like. Since the day I had some cream cheese in sushi I am a fan so when I saw it on the menu I had to try everyone that had cream cheese haha. For dessert which I gave to my friend I had the strawberry mochi. He had the green tea ice cream.  I give it 3 stars. I love the sushi and the guys were friendly making the sushi and the waitress was friendly too. It's far for me but if in the area it is the place I would stop at.",

The fish is not at its freshest/finest compared to other places, most of their rolls are stuffed full of imitation crab, and the rice is pretty inconsistent across chefs, getting bigger with the more you order.   Their deserts are more unique than other places and pretty good. The parfait was the best out of the brulees and tiramisu that we tried among their offerings.

Though there are appetizers and salads, I always go for the nigiri and the rolls to fill that insatiable need for fish and rice. Some of the maki come in hand rolls, while others are baked, deep-fried, full of veggies, spicy, or wrapped in soy paper. You definitely should be able to find at least one item you'll enjoy or you're just flat out doing it wrong.  Once the chopsticks are down and I'm ready to do the Slump of Defeat, the dessert conveniently reminds you that you can get only one of the green tea tiramisu, mochi ice cream, or some of the other selections. Except the ice cream scoops. You can get as many scoops as your dessert stomach can handle!  Service was pretty good, but could be a bit erratic.  They always came to refill our drinks, to check up on us, or to take additional orders.

    "text": "January 11, 2017 @ 10:30pm   Let me begin by saying that this was the worst possible service ever! The food was okay and I have had much better, but this review is strictly based off of service. I've worked in the restaurant industry so I know that when an incomplete party of 8 show up at 10pm, it could be annoying, however, you don't let the customer know. Well, thats what the male busser with spiked black hair and glasses made clear last night. Every question I asked him about our table he would give a short answer and then turn his back on me immediately (Keep in mind, I worked as a hostess in Vegas for 6+ years, I know how to passive aggressively tell a customer F* you and this kid did it.) Next my friend and I asked if we could wait at the bar and grab a drink and wait for the rest of the party to show, then the hostess says,\"If you don't plan on buying anything.\" I get it, they don't want to transfer the bill or whatever, so fine, we wait. Our party arrives and then we are seated and our server, a lady, I don't know her name because she never introduced herself and made it clear we were annoying her. We ordered a lot of food and tons of sushi and when the sushi came out, the staff didn't even know the names of the rolls, so when we would send it back because we did recognize the names, she would immediately come back and act as if it was our fault and stated the correct names (wow). Towards dessert she lightened up a bit. We aren't a difficult crowd, we all work(ed) in the industry and understand the difficulties of customer service (I'm not saying we're saints because we work in the industry, but we are more courteous than most that don't).  I don't recommend this place for service, the sushi was alright. We ordered gyoza, rib eye (which they didn't ask which temperature and we were lucky to get beef jerky), miso soup, calamari, shrimp tempura, creme brulee, mochi, and different flavor ice cream. It was all O.K. All you can eat was the best part of our experience.",

Market price on sushi can add up so this all you can eat deal is the best deal you can get so I would suggest not getting ala carte if you're a big eater on sushi. Two rolls will already set you above the all you can eat price so you might as well get the AYCE deal! I've tried several of their signature rolls such as Oh my heart, Pink lady roll, Dynamite roll and Rock & Roll. All good! Be sure you don't order with you eyes because there's a policy that you have to eat everything. Always best when shared with others, don't all order the same thing. Try a little bit of everything. I always make my money's worth it with orders of shrimp tempura. It's a must whenever I come here. You also get a free dessert with your meal as well. I love the creme brulee, soooo delish!

It's in my rotation for when I'm craving AYCE sushi but not in my top favorites I do prefer others a lot more. It's All You Can Eat sushi and you can really eat all you can eat that's at least until they cut you off. It's your typical AYCE sushi, they all are sushi grade and they make your typical sushi dishes everyone is doing. Not many items wowing me but still many items satisfying.  The bad about Oyshi is their spicy tuna, imitation crab usage, and kind of little nigiri and sushi rolls which is fine if you did AYCE cause you can just order more but not cool if you weren't. They have a lot of items you want to order but aren't available with AYCE. They seem to have a lot of rules.  The good about Oyshi is just about everything else. It's a place to go people watch late nights. Did I already mention their green tea creme brulee. I've been there just for it without ordering anything else and when I do AYCE, I'll make sure there's always room for it at the end. They serve some of their entrees on a sizzling hotplate, I do like the steaks and chicken.   They have a lunch special which includes a soup, salad, and your item of choice from various plates, there's a sushi plate, tempera plate, sashimi plate, and sizzle plate. It's not bad if your not wanting AYCE during lunch.  They offer all my favorites that I must have. They have oysters and uni but they're limited. They have shrimp tempera. They have poke, which like everyone else stretched out with other items. They have a good variety of specialty, tempera, baked, and fried rolls.

My last visit, it took them at least 10 mins to realize that we were standing there waiting to be seated. Then, it took 30 mins for the server to bring us water and miso soup. The owner walks by and doesn't acknowledge us at all. You've got to be fast and efficient, especially a busy place like this, you've got to have more staffs. I will never come back again, even if it's a block away from my house.   Despite my horrible experience, I still love their Love Affair roll, it's the only roll that doesn't fail to satisfy me.",

    "text": "Generally, I wouldn't recommend a place if I wanted to keep it a secret. I would say something like, the place sucks and not to go there. I thought about it, but then then it might backfire and the place closes down. Therefore...  Yes, I am a big fan. I'm not the biggest sushi lover as some people are, but when it's good, it's good. I do believe I've had a wide enough sample of restaurants to know the difference. This place is definitely a place I would recommend.   The place is cool, kind of a drive from the strip, middle of nowhere strip mall with tumble weed crossings, inside is not TOO fancy, and not TOO much the other kind. But really you don't need to care much, as long as it's clean.  The place is all you can eat, not all you can pay for. More like... You can eat all, for one set price (within two hours). Three of the four pages of the menu are all included for that price. And let me tell you, they had every roll I've ever seen or heard of along with many many more that I haven't. But there are also all the wonderful appetizers like the Rib Eye and Shrimp called \"Surf and Turf\" tucked all the way on the last page at the very end. Ya we ordered about 8 of those. That alone, would probably be worth the price.   Between the seven of us we ordered more sushi than I could ever imagine. But it wasn't so much about the quantity but the quality was just as impressive. Of the different rolls I did try. I had, not one complaint. They were as good as I've had at any other Sushi restaurant. I'd go into the names and ingredients of the rolls but if you love sushi, and even if you don't just imagine the ones you like and it's probably on the menu.  Service was pretty good considering how many people were eating all you can eat sushi in the restaurant. I really did expect the sushi to come out one every half hour. But I didn't even notice any wait between drinks, appetizers, sushi, more sushi, more appetizers and finally dessert. In fact, upon ordering an extra Miso soup, It seemed like it got to the table before I finished ordering it. They were that fast.  Eating good food releases endorphins in your brain. A good sign that you just had a good meal with good friends is how much everyone is laughing at the end. And there was plenty of that to be had for everyone. The only reason Its not 5 stars, is because I've had some really good Sushi, but I can't order it here because it's usually a Chef Special at the other places.  By the way, this place sucks.",

My friend and I shared the Spicy Tuna Crunch and I devoured the Japanese Lasagna and the lobster/crab roll alone as he isn't a big fan of any warm sushi.

But the third time I came in was this last week.. I was very disappointed.. First it took them forever to seat us and there wasn't a lot of people.. There was no one in line and they only had a few people in the restaurant. Then all around our service was bad. Our waitress took a long time to take our orders and once we were done with a dish multiple waiters and bussers would walk by and they still wouldn't take away our dirty plates.. Eventually the dishes just piled up. Even when they brought new rolls out they wouldn't take our plates away.. Then to top off a bad experience the sushi was subpar if that. We could tell the fish was previously frozen so it took away the flavor of the fish. I was very disappointed.. The whole experience was bad.",

The rolls came like clockwork but I had to remind the waitress several times that my sake, hamachi and unagi nigiri hadn't come yet. By the way the unagi was cold and didn't taste fresh.  Living in the Bay Area, this place was a pleasant surprise in terms of quality and price. I will try again before heading back...perhaps a second chance at 4 stars.

It obviously hasn't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings! I love their Ayce pricing ($21 lunch/$26 dinner) and of course the all-you-can-eat selections! I highly suggest their yellowtail with pico de gallo, seaweed salad, fresh oysters, and shrimp tempura as starters to prepare you for this sushi selection like Kami Kaze, Dragon, Rock N' Roll, Catepillar, Treasure and etc. Seriously though, this place is amazingly delicious. My only complaint as to why I gave this place a four star instead of a five because customer service can take you a long way and two out of the three times I've been here was a little below fair. It took them almost 20 mins in order to finally give us some attention and take our second order, they didn't refill our drinks unless asked and our wait for our entree was quite some time. Asides that, the food is heavenly mouth-watering and the AYCE pricing is good!",

When I order Tuna nigiri, the sushi came out WET & SOGGY like the fish was just microwaved and defrosted. I do not know what caused it to be wet & soggy but I've never seen such thing in my life. Sea Urchin is not edible if they are not decent quality and this restaurant's sea urchin was not good at all.  Again, rolls are enjoyable but I don't know if  I can call this restaurant a \"good sushi restaurant\".",

    "text": "1) Ambiance: Modern, busy, high energy with techno/dance music playing.  2) Price: Comparable to most AYCE Sushi Joints $21 Lunch/ $26 Dinner  3) Service: Slow as far as food preparation. Spent nearly 2 hours on AYCE for 2 people. The servers & management were very nice though. Drinks were always refilled and they came around to check up on us often.  4) Food: Some of the things we ordered.  Appetizers- Baked Green Mussels were good. I could eat 100. Asian Style Skirt Steak - Came out on a sizzilin' platter & smelled terrific but I wasn't diggin' the taste. Nothing special.  Sushi- Fish was eh... just ok. Not as fresh.  Favorite Rolls- Amigo - jalapeno, combination of fish and cream cheese w/ flaming hot chili sauce. Jalepeno-licious! Love Affair - shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes. Scrumptious!  5) Overall: Satisfactory. There were a lot of things we wanted to try but were too full. I would give this place another shot.",

    "text": "I'm writhing in pain as I write this review because my stomach hurts so flipping bad after eating from here.  Prepare yourself for my meanest review yet.  First, NO.  Just no.  I want to shout this at the top of my lungs to the owner/manager/whatever of this place.  The sushi here was the WORST ever that Ive tasted.  They boast an impressive menu but too bad they do not know how to properly make each roll.  The fish was SLIMY and gross.  Sushi rolls should not slide down your throat, you should be able to chew them and relish in all the amazing flavors.  I couldn't distinguish any of the rolls apart and the WORST one was the Hawaiian roll.  It completely ruined my entire appetite and I couldnt eat any more sushi.  Like literally too disgusted.  Secondly, NO.  The service needed some help.  They were friendly but when they got busy they couldn't keep up.  There were 4 sushi chefs and 3 waitresses with the restaurant being full.  It took forever to get us seated (the hostess has to waitress just to keep up), forever to get our sushi rolls, and forever to get a refill and we went there when it was NOT busy.    Lastly, my boyfriend and I both immediately felt sick to our stomachs when we left.  Like nauseous, clutch your stomach, take tiny sips of water and moan sick.  So why one star?  Why bother to give one?  Because the staff WAS friendly whenever they did talk to us.    Also there were several flies in the restaurant.  DEE-SGUSTING  Harumph!",

If you've ever been eating sushi and thought to yourself, this would be so much better with some Tiesto playing, this is your spot!  First off, don't be discouraged by the wait. They're busy and you should be happy for them. It's usually no more than 15 minutes and you can occupy yourself by practicing new dance moves. We always sit at the sushi bar and the service is friendly and fast. I once saw no less than 6 sushi chefs hustling in that narrow space so you'll be well taken care of.   On to the tasty stuff. What I like most about this joint is if you like deep fried, baked, raw, hot, mild, funky they've got you covered. I hate places that are all cooked or all raw, you've gotta people please!  From the freshness of the fish, to the sauces they're paired with it's all a win. Their all you can eat knows almost no bounds so if you're not busting at the end you've done something wrong. To top it all off the strawberry ice cream they serve is surprisingly top notch, little strawberry swirl through it and everything.   They also have 2 private rooms for large parties and I know this because I spied on them when I was there like a creeper. Try this place out next time you're in the southwest. We were happy to find it on our side of town and not have to venture to Sushi Blvd aka Eastern.",

Oyshi has a very contempory & modern decor to it, with a cool geisha painting on one of the huge walls.   My dinner at Oyshi was so fast, I couldn't even comprehend the food I ate. For starters - the mussels are a MUST and so is the ahi poke which is very fresh tuna.   Their sushi selection on the menu is so vast you don't even know what to order. If I had to pick only one sushi roll from the menu it would have to be the volcano roll.  The price is definitely worth this buffet which is around $26.",

    "text": "Do you want to eat at a place that has cockroaches? Well if that's your type of place come to Oyshi. They linger on the booths hidden between the seats. Beware!  This by far was the worst experience I've had dining at a Japanese restaurant. Yes, this place seems popular but is it clean? Hell to the No!  I can only imagine what they are doing when they are behind the kitchen cooking up a storm.    My fam bam was doing the famous all you can eat. Everything was going smoothly until my cousin noticed this cockroach roaming in the seats. We addressed this to the server who apologized and moved us to a different table. Obviously we lost our appetite. I asked to speak to a manager and as I was looking back the staff was heckling and laughing. They were fully aware of the cockroach issue and perhaps they thought it was funny that we actually saw one. I spoke to the manager and he was not helpful. He was like I'll comp the drinks and the kids meal. Helloooo. There was three all you can eat. He also spoke to me like he also knew about the cockroach problem and explained that summer season that can happen.   As a food venue, that is unacceptable. Do you know what type of diseases or sicknesses that can bring to a human. What if it landed in my soup and I  swallowed a cockroach? Would they blame that on the summer months? As we all know there are tons of food venues around Las Vegas and most are really clean. I would think the health district would not even let a venue like that pass with an A rating if it was infested with cockroaches. For all those who want to experience the future Oyshi dining.. make sure you bring an insect repellant spray so that way you are sure not to get that on your food. Beware of cockroaches!  They can creep up on your soup or maybe even become an appetizer if you aren't paying attention. Cockroach roll with the eel sauce, anyone?   Just to let everyone know. I paid for my meal. I am not the type to look for comps. I am the type that enjoys a clean place to eat.",

They have a vast selection of rolls, which is great for that type of sushi lover...I prefer a wider variety of nigiri sushi and other items.  Our most recent visit here was a group of 8 and it was terrible. Our server was slow in taking our orders, and also kept messing up. Our orders were either incorrect in terms of quantity and selection, or they didn't arrive at all. The quality of the sushi was average. They didn't have enough teapots (we ordered hot green tea) so we had to WAIT for one to become available. Really.  They added on the automatic group tip that is typical with parties of 8+. What was suprising was that it was for 20% of the bill. We were so anxious to be done with that place, we didn't even bother bringing it up. And just to put things in perspective, our bill listed we ordered 12 items for a group of 8.  So that should tell you we were in no way high maintenance. I cannot stress how terrible the service was. This should not be acceptable, especially in a town that has a ton of sushi restaurants.  I would never go back here again, especially in a large group situation. So disappointing.",

Also at the same time I had a baked roll with shrimp w/crab and lobster on top. The crab was super fishy smelling and just didn't taste right. I should have sent it back but our waitress was never at our table. Twice we had to have one of the guys who brings out the food go get her.

We always come for AYCE dinner and the wait is always really long even with reservations.   Once we are seated, it usually takes them a couple minutes to get our drinks and then a while long for our orders. We are so aware of their efficiency, or lack thereof, we would write down on a piece of paper of what we want and then just hand it to them. Kudos to us!   The food would always take forever to arrive and the hot dishes are always what come out first. I never understand that since raw fish simply needs to be sliced and plated... Unless they wanna fill us up with the cheap stuff first...? Hmmmmmmm.   And once the food arrives, they are always subpar or mediocre. Nothing ever wows my husband and I.   Overall, service is extremely slow. This should be a french japanese fusion restaurant in the sense that it's gonna be a three hour meal eating japanese food. The food is mediocre. The price is not spectacular. I would never come back if I can help it.   Oh, it's the same slowness at lunch, by the way. Most items on the menu is around $10-$12. The non sushi dishes came out first for my group today and halfway through their meal, my sushi bowl came out - mediocre yet again.   That was my last straw; I am going somewhere else.",

Typically the appetizers should come out first. I understand the kitchen can be backed up sometimes though. I like that they had a variety of baked rolls and the music was good as well. The policy on all you can eat is that you cannot take any food home but that's OK I guess some places let you and some don't. All in all I would come back not far from me and the price is right.",

Our waiter Kevin was a great help when choosing from the extensive menu. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "It was just OK. We went based upon raves from our friends who went for the AYCE deal. We are not AYCE fans but decided to try the ala-carte option.  It's a very large place and was bustling on a Saturday night. Lots of families. Very loud booming music (not for us) When we go out we look for a relaxing experience - this isn't it.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess and our server. When we said we didn't want AYCE we were given an additional menu. So we had a large menu with the rolls and AYCE info and another with \"dinner\" options. They have lots of rolls with the \"dynamite\" mix which seems to be Krab mixed with other seafood and mayo.  The sushi is a B-. Certainly the quality isn't up to our other favs like Sen and Soho but not bad. They have a lot of rolls and cooked menu options. I had the \"steak\" on rice. In parens because it seemed more like chopped beef. It didn't resemble a quality steak but for $12 who could expect otherwise. The sauce was high in sugar and salt. Very tasty but we were thirsty all night.  The tempura was very greasy. Not a redo.  Service was great!  Prices are very reasonable and you get a lot with the dinner orders. If you like a lot of ok food at cheap prices this is definitely the place for you.",

But if you're into that kind of thing go ahead.   Food wise they could cut back on the rice. The rice they put is a little much. I like to judge a sushi joint by their Unagi (eel) i was not impress with the unagi here. It was a little cold.   Overall it was ok.just okay",

I would recommend going during lunch before the dinner rush or you'll be waiting for 30-40 mins before being seated.   Customer service from \"some\" servers need to be re-evaluated or re-trained being that \"Las Vegas\" is a number one place of customer service (personal opinion)  Other than that it's a great restaurant, definitely one in our books for a eating spot with friends.",

    "text": "After years of going to crowded sushi bars with minimal arm room between me and others, I found a location with comfort as well as a great selection of sushi creations. The restaurant is an upscale environment with room for large parties.    - The restaurant offers a huge menu of both sushi and hot kitchen items (e.g., sushi, koma, Hamachi, sizzling hot plates of steak and seafood, tempura, oysters, soups/salads, and desserts).   -  There is usually a wait to be seated. The wait is sometimes as long as an hour during peek dinner times. You can drop in to be put on the list, and they will text you when they are ready to seat you. They take reservations.   - They offer an all you can eat sushi menu for about $25 that includes one desert (e.g., green tea ice cream, creme brulee, Moche ice cream).  - My favorites are the yellowtail koma, double salmon roll, surf and turf sizzling hot plate, spicy tuna hand roll, fresh sashimi red snapper and halibut, Red Rock sushi roll, and the vanilla creme brulee with green tea ice-cream.   I've been to this location over a dozen times in just the last four months - my most frequent visit being last week for lunch. I generally ask for my favorite sushi chef and server, and I am willing to wait for them. Vincent is the best server!  This restaurant generally wants the server to tell the sushi chef your order even as you sit at the bar. At first I wasn't fond of this process, but it works well and there isn't a lag in service. The sushi chef still hands you your order -it just prevents you from yelling out at a busy chef. Vincent offers exceptional service that includes getting your beverages, kitchen items, and sushi bar order. He is exceptional.   The sushi chefs are all awesome, but my favorite is Ivan. When the restaurant isn't too busy, he will inquiry if you want anything. If you request, he will also make creations for you based on what he notices you like. He is efficient, creative, and humorous.",

    "text": "Had dinner here tonight around 6:15. There was quite a line of people but we got seated within 20 minutes, which was great.  First of all, walking inside the restaurant, there was a strong scent of frying oil. I assume the ventilation inside is not strong enough. I've been to KFC and Popeyes without smelling that much oil frying.  We told the hostess our party had 4 people, when she walked us to the table, she took away a setting and set the table for 3, I didn't understand why she did that. So we asked a server to get us another setting, I'm not sure if he didn't hear us or if he was confused because we had to point out what a \"table setting\" was before he went to get it.  We didn't do the AYCE, just a few menu items: Unagi & Avocado Roll: The sushi roll was made badly, the rice was falling apart and there was a lot of avocado, barely any eel and smothered in way too much sauce. Donburi: Donburi is a combo of thin sliced beef (that is NOT all lean meat), egg, onions over rice with sauce in it. The one we got was dry, barely any sauce until you hit way bottom. The beef used was all lean and definitely not thinly sliced. Kids Popcorn Chicken & Teriyaki Chicken meals: The popcorn chicken was overcooked. They definitely fried it for too long. It was dry and some pieces had a burnt taste. My son ate a few pieces and said he didn't like it. The Teriyaki chicken was also overcooked. The chicken was hard to chew.  Service: We saw a lot of servers walking around, but it didn't look like they were doing anything productive. Only the manager (we assume, he was well dressed not in server type uniform) came by multiple times to see if our table was doing OK. Otherwise, the server would come by drop off food and disappear before we can even ask for anything.  Maybe, we'll give it another try in the future, but for now, it was not the dinner we expected to have.",

The sea urchin was bad - it was spoiled and smelled bad.  We paid our bills and left without finishing the foods.",

    "text": "Update: I visited the Rainbow location last night at 12:50am with some friends. (They close at 2am) We were told they were closing early because they were slow and they took last call at 12:45am. I questioned the guy and mentioned that their hours say 2am. My friends drove 45 minutes specifically to go to Oyshi! He said they decided to close early and we couldn't eat. I even mentioned that we knew exactly what we wanted, since their \"last call\" was 5 minutes earlier. He was not very friendly!   During the time we were standing outside deciding where to go, more people came and got very upset. That's at least 9 people they turned away! If your hours are until 2am, you should be open until 2am. From what I saw, they lost enough business to make it worth being open until the normal time. Next time we are going to eat, Oyshi will not even be an option unless it's early in the evening. When businesses aren't reliable, you're not gonna go out of your way to visit! Or tell others to visit at all! My review went from 5 stars down to 2. This isn't the first issue I've had at this location! Customer service is everything.   As far as the food...  My friend told me about this place and their All You Can Eat sushi but I wasn't too sure about going because I only like one kind of roll. When we decided to go, I asked her if they had a regular menu because I wouldn't be able to eat that much sushi to justify All You Can Eat. When we arrived I was shocked that their all you can eat menu included appetizers, sushi, and dessert! This was perfect!  My friend and I both ordered the Love Affair roll which is shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. (no eel sauce for me) It was delicious!!! We also ordered....  Gyoza- nothing special but yummy!  Surf & Turf Platter- all the platters are small, so you can easily order two. The steak is pretty good and the shrimp was amazing. (I am very picky when it comes to shrimp)  Ebi- the best I've ever had.   Teriyaki chicken- yummy  I absolutely love this place! I love variety without spending a fortune AND they are open late. (Well they are when they DECIDE to stay open)   Price:  $22 for lunch $27 for dinner",

    "text": "OUR FAVORITE SUSHI SPOT SINCE 2009. We've been here a few dozen times, and are never disappointed with the food or the service! The downfall is that wait times can be extensive at times depending on when you go, but average wait is 10-20 minutes... and it's oh-so worth the wait! Lunch is 22$, dinner is $27. (For children 12 and under, lunch is 16 and dinner is $19.) They use fresh ingredients, the food presentation is beautiful, the service is always great and we always leave so full & so happy! ^___^  We like to order: APPETIZERS: - Ahi poke - Calamari  - Fresh oysters (two pieces per order, one order per person only) - Dynamite (scallop, shrimp, crab mix, mushroom & onion baked w/ yum yum sauce) - Baked mussels (5 piece limit per person)  - Asian skirt steak - Yakitori shrimp & asparagus  - Rib eye steak  SUSHI ROLLS - Love affair - Vegas roll  - Premium spider - Japanese Garlic Lasagna  - Lobster Affair  - Oyshi roll  - Salmon nigiri - Unagi nigiri  DESSERT: - Green tea berry parfait - Vanilla creme brulee  - Green tea ice cream (desserts are one order per customer except for ice cream)  PRO TIP: If you have peanut allergies, you'll be happy to know they do not use ANYTHING with peanuts, none of their dressings contain it and they do not use peanut oil.  PRO TIP II: Also, For parties of 8 or more, 18% gratuity is added to the bill (this includes children and any patrons who are seated at the table, whether eating or not).",

We made a reservation and still wait for 15 minutes before we were seated. Then another 10 minutes to wait for the server came to take orders. The foods came slow and the sea urchins were not fresh. We ordered two bowl of rice for two toddlers and they charged them $3 each. They didn't come to clean our table until the foods were served. I was helping them to stack up the empty plates in order for them to come pick them up quickly. They missed our orders even I reminded them about that for at least twice. They charged 20% tips on the bill for a party of 5 audits and two toddlers. I don't mind to give them the tips but the services were terrible. We won't come back to this restaurant.",

Oyshi was one of our typically sushi joint however the service we have received lately has been pushing us away more. Geno provided horrible customer service. He barely came to our table, in fact he went to the other tables more often and skipped ours. We were one of his first tables but the last to leave due to slow service. We needed refills twice but he was no where to be found so we were forced to wait. He never said thank you and overall had no manners. The other food runners had better service. Overall I was very disappointed with his slow, careless, and rude service.",

We waited to be sat at the sushi bar for about 2 minutes, not bad at all. They seated us and it took 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were there. If my wife hadn't been with me, I would have walked! So we waited and finally got some unenthusiastic server who never even asked if we wanted another drink, after we finished the first round. Poor service aside? The food was fantastic! Everything was fantastic! It's hard to pull off a soup, salad, 2 appetizers, and multiple custom rolls and be that on point! So this review was a bit hard to write and be honest about the bad service, because I walked out of there 10 times happier than when I walked in. We're going back to see if there's some better service, the sushi was that good! I'm hoping so! Could have been an off night and we hit it just right! Went back for round 2! Was just as awesome food wise, the service was better this time too. I bumped my review up by 1 star, for the better service! Sushi was on point!",

It's somewhat hard to standout in such a crowded field.  Generally, I like to categorize them in which part of town they are in.  One of my \"must go\" places have been added in the Southwest section in Las Vegas.  Oyshi Sushi won't have the premium quality sushi, expect the fish to be previously frozen but still is not bad, the rice to fish ratio is more fish than rice, the rolls are not too over sauced, the salmon roe and flying fish eggs to be plentiful.  Customer service is excellent and attentive, they will stop by frequently to check if you want more orders.  Several notes:  They charge for green tea, so don't be surprised to tacked on a few more dollars for this.  The prices are in line with other AYCE restaurants, just a few dollars above $20 for lunch and around $26 for dinner.  Pass on the green tea creme brulee and green tea ice cream, barely any hints of green tea at all.",

Our water refill took a little while and it was a little impersonal, which is expected from most sushi places, but not something as modern and Oyshi.  For starters, they upped their prices? The only reason why I can see they did that is because they are further away from China Town, but when you are subpar to Chinatown sushi, it's a waste.. I did not feel like it was worth $28.   The nigiri was very good. Very fresh sushi, the fish to rice ratio was perfect. I just was not a fan of anything else we ordered. The oysters were so bland! And it had so many toppings on it too.. It was a disappointment because I love oysters, and I liked their mussels, but their 4 pc limit was a little sad.  I just think you can't up the prices without upping the quality nor the service. I will be using my fifteen minutes to drive China Town instead of here.",

I usually go for a chicken dish of some sort and was thrilled when I saw Oyshi has chicken teriyaki. My entree came with soup & salad. The salad was enormous and SO good - probably the best ginger dressing I have ever had. The chicken teriyaki came out on a skillet and a bowl of rice. It seemed to be more darker meat. The teriyaki sauce was sweet & good. My only complaint was the abundance of onions... I love onions but it was too much for me. The onion scent stayed with me the rest of the day! The amount of food I got for ~$9 was mind blowing. Would recommend this place for sure!",

The service was on point. They were bringing rolls out left and right. There were about 4 folks serving us and they were super chill.  One even participated in our mannequin challenge haha",

Dessert included creme brulee was amazing, save room. My first visit, with my nephew who frequents the wonderful Sushi and Japanese food establishment.",

This is my go to place for sushi with my husband and his co workers  The wait can be long, so get here early. The longest we've ever waited is max 20 mins  AYCE for lunch is 21 and dinner is 26 bucks, not bad. Which includes a large amount of appetizers and desserts  Favorite rolls: spicy tuna crunch, tiger roll, snow mountains.   The desserts are delicious. The biggest hits being green tea mochi ice cream and the green tea tiramisu.    The service is excellent, the rolls take a while to come out but it's worth the wait because you can taste the freshness.   Like all sushi places, they charge you if you waste food. One bite or two isn't a big deal but don't waste an entire roll.  The restaurant looks like a high ended sushi house, that's well decorated. Very clean and open.   Can't wait to take my out of town friends here.",

After 30 minutes of waiting, only 1 of the 2 appetizers and 3 of the 4 rolls we ordered arrived. We ate everything quickly since we were hungry and wanted to order more rolls. For the second order, we asked for 4 more rolls and again, only 3 of the 4 came to the table. We kept asking, when are the other rolls and appetizer coming? All they said was \"well let them know\". Finally, dessert time came and they were all out of everything green tea, so we settled for a strawberry mochi instead. We left without getting our appetizer and 2 of our rolls. I still paid $28 each. Wouldn't come here again.",

I didn't even get my dessert because my husband was so livid, which he had every right to be, get it together Oyshi! They said the manager stepped out. How convenient...

We always sit at the bar in the back corner as it is cozy and has a great view of the flat screen TV on the wall that always has the latest sports game playing.   We have our favorite rolls and this time we enjoyed a new appetizer that was really good. The popcorn scallops was a yummy appetizer we tried which came with a honey mustard and a spicy ranch dipping sauce.   What we really like about Oyshi is the consistency in service and food quality. We have never really been disappointed with a visit, it is an easy and happy relationship we have with Oyshi.  I really enjoy the flavors of the Oyshi roll and the Lobster Affair which both melt in my mouth. My lover boy likes the spicy rolls such as the nuclear bomb and the atomic roll. He loves anything that is spicy and that has jalapeno in it  When I want a satisfying mouth orgasm this is where I go to get it over and over and over again.  I like mouth orgasms caused by Amazing flavors exploding in my mouth!",

The Sizzling plates are a must try, especially the sweet & spicy pork. Also desert, chocolate crem brulee is a fave!  Environment: a modern setting I would say. Music was a bit over taking. Also we sat in a booth and the tables were a bit close to each other, you can hear the whole conversation of the party next to you.  Service: ohhhh the service here is why I gave this place only 3 stars. The service is extra slow even on a easy pace night. Took about 15 min after we sat to just get our waters. Ordered our food and plates were taken off the table when we weren't even done.. I'm sure they could do better.  Other than that, wouldn't mind coming again!",

For $26 (dinner) AYCE, you get beyond your money's worth.  The menu offers a variety of appetizers, rolls, nigiri, and dessert. (Of course, sashimi is NOT included).  Some of my favorites include: Appetizers: oysters, mussels, rib eye, surf & turf, dynamite Rolls: Ian special, double screaming & love affair Nigiri: SUPER WHITE TUNA!, hamachi (yellowtail) & salmon Dessert: creme brule & green tea ice cream parfait.  The overall restaurant has a great vibe, good energy/music, and attentive staff.  The last time we went here was a table of 14 and all of orders came out correct and in a timely manner.

The place is always made by the environment around and today we definitely did not feel welcomed   The hostess is greeted us and showed us to the table with a smile but that is where the courtesy ended...  We waited 15min to get asked for drinks, another 15 to order then even thought we were doing AYCE we waited 35 min to be able to add to our order at this point we felt ignored considering there were only 6 other tables occupied around us. We decided to cut it short and just go straight to dessert, we figured some ice cream could make us feel better, but upon ordering our desserts my hubby was given a creme brulee when he told our waitress he wanted the berry parfait, it would have been fine had she just apologized when we brought it up to her but she says I pointed to the brulee, ??? Well being that he ordered his own dessert we just looked away...at this point upset and confused we just paid our bill and left.... Sorry but no matter how great your food taste a staff with bad attitudes definitely brings your score down...  Sorry to say we won't be visiting this location anymore... Our best advice, perhaps order to go if you wanna try them out!",

Mochi- tasted like it came straight from sams club.. its filled with sugary nasty goup instead of ice cream.  Ribeye-the beef is most definitely the worst cut of beef you can buy..  indistinguishable from wal mart beef no flavor.. no fat.. terrible thick cuts.. what the hell are they serving it for.. but beef that you would use with teriyaki or take it off the menu.. its not Ribeye!  all the crab is fake.. which is typical for sushi places but this imitation crab again tasted like sams club crap..   Tuna.. i don't know what is up with that tuna but I've had a lot of sushi and this tuna tasted like it had been frozen thawed, frozen, thawed, frozen and thawed.. thats the only way i can describe the taste and texture... plus the poke..  Poke isnt really poke.. there was 3 pieces of tuna in it.. rest was seaweed, and cucumber... don't call it poke.. i love poke.. i came here because i was told the poke is great... this was not poke.. and if it was it was the worst poke I've ever had.

    "text": "This place has excellent sushi and the ayce menu is very extensive. It's priced about what all other sushi restaurants charge so that is fine. It's also pretty big and open which is nice because you don't feel too packed in.   I really enjoy all their different rolls but my favorites are the Rock n Roll and the crunchy scallop roll. The scallop roll has these little popcorn scallop pieces that are just so tasty.   For dessert I always get the creme brulee. If you get ayce, you only get one, but if you order a la carte the creme brulee is served with three flavors (vanilla, green tea, and chocolate) but the vanilla is the best.   The downside to this restaurant is the wait to get seated which can sometimes be a good hour or more because it's popular. The second downside is the service. Sometimes they are pretty unattentive due to the fact that they are so busy.",

Does it matter either way? Masa or Jiro may not care much for it, but by AYCE standards, it's the best sushi in town (best a la carte goes to Naked Fish.) Service is okay but gets a little hectic when the restaurant is at full capacity. No big deal. As an added and bizarre surprise, the pint-sized creme brulee is the greatest I've ever had. If you can resist cramming your stomach with one more roll, be sure to end the meal with it.",

We didn't mind the wait, we were pretty excited to try somewhere new. Our waiter immediately took our drink orders, and then asked if we'd like to order. All three of us got all you can eat, so we could try a bunch of stuff together. We got edemame, chicken yakitori, muscles, raw oysters, gyoza, yellowtail nigiri, miso soup, and a few rolls. The raw oysters were outstanding. Soooo fresh and good! The chicken was tasty, the muscles were fresh and not too much sauce,  the edemame was steamed perfectly. The nigiri was a little different, but tasted okay. The tiger roll and the screaming roll were only okay. An OVERLOAD of rice, it was almost astonishing. Like holy shit, that's a lot of rice, bro. The hawiaan and whatever rolls my friend got were pretty tasty. Overall, it's worth it just for the appetizers. I'll come back to try different rolls  By the way, when my friend got a refill on her sprite, he came back and she said that the syrup was all out, it just tasted like soda water. He was confused. Did she want another one? Uhm. Yeah. So he went into the kitchen, literally stood there for a few seconds, and came back and gave her the SAME glass. Oh boy.  Other than that weird mishap, service was pretty good.",

Only downsides to the AYCE is that 1) it doesn't include sashimi, and 2) if you don't finish everything you pay the $26 plus a charge for any remaining rolls. However, if you have one or two you that just can't handle they'll usually cut you slack. Service is decent and friendly. Overall a great hidden gem everyone should try.",

The wait to get seated can be gruesome depending on the time of arrival and time of the day. Once seated though service has always been great. Their rolls are fully stuffed so be careful, you can easily get stuffed with just a few. Start out light with a few Appetizers then go in on a roll or two. They do half orders also so that's always the best way to gonif you just want to taste a new roll. Sushi has always been fresh here and I hope it remains that way. I've been coming to this place for about 7yrs now. My first sushi restaurant experience and I'm glad its still around! Try this place out, you won't leave unsatisfied",

    "text": "ok i think i've mastered the art of the AYCE menu here now. lol  not sure why but the meal i had last night seemed to be better than my other visits. maybe because i didn't over order this time which i tend to do.  btw you may be wondering why i keep coming back here if i'm so unhappy with the service... it's because it's so close to where i stay.. and my friends like it and good company makes everything better.  so last night we started with some appetizers while we waited for a couple other friends to arrive. once they came we ordered rolls.. then continued with nigiri.. and finished off with dessert. a few appetizers were thrown in here and there.. and this strategy definitely worked.  stars of the night:  house salad: i really liked their dressing.. it was kinda a peanut ginger-y dressing. super refreshing and a decent size. it can definitely be shared  baked green mussels: not too fishy tasting and the sauce on top is super creamy and delicious  oysters: max order is 1 per person which comes with 4 oysters... tasty!   sexy roll: i believe it has fried unagi on top with yum yum scallops inside and a creamy mango sauce on top... my favorite of the night.  agedashi tofu: their version is really tasty. the tofu itself stays crisp on the outside even after its been sitting there for a few minutes.. and the sauce is perfect.. not bland at all  premium spider roll: with avocado and cream cheese and possibly unagi on top. cant remember but it was deeeelicious!  service was ok in the beginning but really began to slow down as it got busy. we were seated in the area sectioned off to the side so it was easy to forget about us.. and we sure felt forgotten at times.   as for dessert they were out of mochi the last time we were there.. this time they didnt have the strawberry. ooo my friends were super disappointed :(  tip: monday and tuesdays they have a 2 for 1 house sake special :)",

    "text": "I have always been a fan of Oyshi Sushi as it took my sushi virginity! I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets.   Service is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer).   The draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.  Mussels, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, Oyshi Roll, and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites!",

The decor is adequate, but the music was really odd for a restaurant: one of the first songs we heard was about eating pussy and there were many songs with the n word. I expect that while I'm at the club, but while I'm eating? Completely tasteless!   The service was lacking but not the worst I've seen. At one point the waitress came over to check the amount of wine left in the bottle, then set it down and walked away even though two of our glasses were empty! The food came out very slowly, but that's typical of an all-you-can-eat place, where they want you to fill up in between courses and order less.   The food itself was extremely disappointing. Most of the rolls had ingredients that are never in real sushi: cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and other odd things. They were presented attractively but were drenched in cream sauces and the ones that were fried were disgustingly greasy. The fish was fresh enough but not even close to the quality I'm used to.   I guess if you've never had really high quality sushi you might enjoy this place (judging from other reviewers) but if you appreciate only the best sushi, you'll probably want to skip Oyshi. I definitely won't go back!",

I tried a spicy tuna handroll and the fish was not fresh so I had to return it (since you're charged for not eating everything that's ordered from the \"all you can eat\").  I stick with non-sushi items such as the udon or this teriyaki beef rice bowl. I do like the ninja meal (veggie and shrimp tempura, California roll, and teriyaki chicken) but I can only order it if my nephew comes along (for kids only-and they're really strict about it).  In fact they're so strict that my nephew ordered it and he drank a bottle of milk so he was too full to eat. They wouldn't even let us bring the kids meal home.

One last thing to mntion is the lady waitress, she was really not professional. We asked her to clean up our dishes before the cakes come, she picked up 2 dishes then never come back.

    "text": "Finally made it to Vegas to try Oyshi sushi. I learned about this place from a website called Sushinomads. It had good reviews so I had to plan to go the next time I was in Vegas. We went during lunch AYCE sushi which is not much different from dinners AYCE. I must say that the quality of the food deserves five stars. They offer a lot of interesting styles of rolls and also offer specials of the day that are included in AYCE. My test for all sushi restaurants I go to is the Salmon Skin Handroll. Oyshi passed with flying colors. The salmon skin was crispy. The seaweed was crunchy and not soggy from getting drenched with eel sauce to add flavor. Salmon skin roll is a simple roll but can easily be ruined if not done correctly. Since that turned out well, I was really looking forward to trying the wide selections of rolls that they offered on the menu. You pretty much have the whole menu to choose from including appetizers, salads and desserts for the AYCE. So if it's not just sushi you're craving, the AYCE is still an excellent choice. We will definitely go back to try the many different sushi & rolls we were to full to try.",

The waiter didn't bother to check on us unless he had food to deliver. And the Sushi was warm. I've had way better sushi at other places then what we we're served at Oyshi. And the oysters we're only 2 per customer. So don't expect all you can eat oysters. We stayed about an hour and 45 minutes at Oyshi. Half of the time we just sat there looking around for our waiter to come by and refill our drinks. The best thing on the menu we're the baked mussels.",

    "text": "I decided that I wanted AYCE sushi last night (Saturday) so I headed over to Oyshi.  I checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  It was a nice night, so I just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  There were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.  We were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  The place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"VIP\" rooms behind us.  It was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.  After a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our AYCE preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  We were.  I started with miso soup, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"ahi poke\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  Note:  I thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  I guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.  The nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  The nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  The ahi poke was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of seaweed salad and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what I think of when I think poke, but I'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).  The oysters came out a few minutes later.  They were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  I can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  Engh, I figured I'd keep moving forward, after all this was AYCE...  Round two:  More nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  We also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  Again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  I'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  There were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that I was sure we didn't order.  The spider roll was basically a California roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.  Since I was disappointed with the Spider roll and I love soft-shell crab, I put in an order for a Monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  What came out was something similar to the Spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  Slow down on that eel sauce dawg.  At this point, I was pretty full and done trying...  The sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  By this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.  I finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea ice cream mochi ball.  Both of these items were good.  After tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, I had spent about $75 for the two of us.  I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon, but I made the best of it while I was there.",

    "text": "We get into Vegas Friday evening, checked in, and began our weekend off with a night of debauchery.  Food porn at Oyshi. Yessiree, four hungry men and a AYCE Japanese food? This is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. We get there and it's packed. A nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. Shit, thats it? His reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. Dude! We'll wait.   The restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. Its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. Like Gerald S pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. The good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded.   The AYCE is probably the best and only way to go here. There are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as I thought it would be. They do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. The sushi was very well made and fresh. Their sushi cuts are very generous. They hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. Everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla ice cream!!!   Like hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. Nothing was safe. We washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). For $25, I would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. The food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. The service was simply awesome. If it's a Friday or Saturday, give them a call to make reservations. We left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales.   You may have defeated us Oyshi, but we'll be back. Back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*",

    "text": "If it wasn't for a stubborn friend, we would have gotten here earlier and avoided a \"long\" wait.  This friend said take the 95, take the 95, blah blah blah.  Even after the waiter said take the 215, my friend INSISTED on taking the 95.  The waiter probably said: \"whatever, dude, get lost and then wait longer and have your friends kick your ass before you eat our delicious buffet\".  After another friend looked Oyshi Sushi himself, we found out that we should take the 215 and did so after I got all frustrated driving in the 15 fwy traffic.  In any case, after waiting and getting seated at our table, we went straight to ordering our all-you-can-eat, which includes 2 uni (sea urchin) pieces, 2 amaebi (raw, sweet shrimp) pieces & 4 raw oysters.  Yep, there's a limit on those but you must understand that there aren't that many other places that would even give you these premium sushi pieces.  Just a note on the uni - slightly less fresh than I've had before.  In any case, you get these in addition to their fresh & delicious sushi.  Their salmon, yellowtail, albacore, halibut sushis are great, plus they don't give you as much rice in their sushi as other places.  Their rib-eye teriyaki is also an excellent dish to have.  Their tempura is also very good.  As for the dessert, we all had the strawberry mochi ice cream, which was very good.  All for $25 per person.  Not bad at all.  I only have to mention a couple of cons: there is a 1 dessert limit for each person.  However, you can have all the ice cream you want since this is not considered one of the dessert items.  Plus, I find it just strange that the place is so huge and yet they waste so much space & put tiny little tables in the center when you can get bigger tables there to accommodate more people.  Last con... service.  A bit slow.  It was a really busy night, but I'm still surprised that they took more than 15 mins to take out raw food.  There was a 2-hr limit, but I don't think they pushed this limit all too much.",

    "text": "My oh my what can I say. It was definitely Oishi, even if they did spell it wrong. I came to vegas to quell the beckoning of the seven deadly sins. And I can safely say I left knowing full well that Gluttony is very satisfied (there's got to be some sort of ironic word play here, but goodness I can never figure it out). Oyshi Sushi has definitely raised the bar for the SoCal AYCE sushi restaurants. I might even say it is comparable to the delicious and the very-missed Kami (RIP)  The SKINNY: I came with a group of 12. I was one of the last to show up, and I was very surprised at the fact that it could seat 12 people. The usual AYCE sushi ordering paradigm (...i barreled through 4 seasons of The Big Bang Theory) is a check list that is given to the waitress, which will be dropped off at the chef, and eventually you'll be nom-noming your way through delectable bite size raw fish goodness. But here, there is no checklist, you order directly to the waitress. But amazingly almost all orders made by the 12 people were satisfied! This place has amazing service with a very patient staff, and a variety of Nigiri and Rolls that i so deeply yearn for here in california. It's 26 dollars well spent my friends.   The Food: Okay so originally we were suppose to go to Sushi Mon, but one thing led to another and we ended up at Oyshi. \"they have a better variety of rolls, and most of our group prefers rolls....\" Hearing it breaks my heart, but the need of the many outweighs the need of the few, so I had to comply. But! hot dam, this place got some unique selections for just the simple nigiri. Spanish Mackerel? Garlic Tuna? Halibut? Seriously, the Koreans owning our local southern california ayce sushi joints needs to take a page of the koreans owning Nevada's ayce sushi joints. I have to say, they were all amazing (with the exception of the cajun albacore. that was just good. But it's still better than bad) I have to point out the fact that they offer a free order of Amaebi and Uni, AND 4 pcs of raw oysters per customer. Being that most of the people I went with was apprehensive to raw food, I ate more than enough free orders. My goodness, my raw oyster cravings won't start up for at least another month (seriously, it's like a menstrual cycle. I know, i'm disgusting).  Everybody speaks of how great their rolls are, and sure they are pretty good. But honestly, I can't remember them for the life of me. So maybe they were more forgettable than spectacular. But who cares, give me another 4 pieces of raw oysters dammit! That's what's important here.  The Service:  Oh poor poor waitress. She had to go through so much...good thing we tipped her generously (and this is coming from a Chiense man). The service is actually spot on, given that there were some dead times where our food arrived a bit slow, but its a minor issue. Afterall, there were probably 5 sushi chefs taking care of a whole restaurant, INCLUDING a party of 12.   This place is a bit off the Vegas Strip, but who cares, it's all you can eat SUSHI. and It's good! The only reason why you wouldnt come out here is if you said \"Oh i ate too much at the Wynn Buffet already.\" And that's barely an excuse.",

    "text": "FOOD: 2/5 I wouldn't call myself a sushi extraordinaire, but I do think that I have been to quite a few sushi spots and have a holistic view of what I do and do not like. I think that this location's sushi just didn't hit the target. The baked sushi came out cold (will elaborate on this in the section below), and they were nearly always DRENCHED (not an over-exaggeration) in sauce. I did, however, rather enjoy the sashimi, but that is because it came out plain and simple.   I ordered the following on my last visit: Kimono roll, Japanese Lasagna, Shrimp Tempura, Baked Tuna, and Tuna Sashimi. We didn't do AYCE because my stomach can't handle that much food. Anyway, the Kimono roll was pretty good--instead of nori, it was wrapped in soy rice paper, so I was digging the difference. However, when I picked it up a piece with my chopsticks, the whole thing fell apart. For $12 for five or six pieces, I was not impressed. I think this happened with nearly all of the rolls I ordered EXCEPT for the Shrimp Tempura roll. The Japanese Lasagna was drenched in sauce and topped with creamed cheese. It was cold and the flavor was too rich and too heavy. I couldn't even taste any of the other elements of it because it was overpowered by unagi sauce and cream cheese. The Baked Tuna came with poor presentation--already coming apart before any of us even attempted to grab a piece. It was cold and had too much unagi sauce. Like I said, the tuna sashimi was pretty good. Not as fresh as other places that I have been to, but it did the job.   SERVICE: 2.5/5 I am not sure why it took so long to get my food. Each roll came out one at a time with nearly five minutes between each. By the time our last roll came, we didn't want to eat anymore. Additionally, people around us who ordered similar rolls (baked, fried, etc.) got their food very quickly. When the food came out it was room temperature or cold when it was supposed to be baked. Our whole dining experience lasted nearly 2 hours because of the delay. We were never apologized to; it nearly seemed like a norm for food to come out to the tables that slowly. I had to check on each (again--not an over-exaggeration) roll to see when and if they were coming out. I would like to say, though, the server did refill my water quite a few times.   AMBIANCE: 3/5 The music was pretty loud in this place, which didn't really appeal to me. It kind of made me have an aversion to my meal and a bit of a headache. I think that is what they were going for though: a modern feel for younger folk. I appreciated the attempt. The decor was pretty nice though. I also enjoyed the wall designs.   PRICE: 2.5/5 I have to say that I am not very happy to have spent $55 for sushi that I didn't quite enjoy. The food was rather high-priced for the quality of service and food offered. I would say that compared to their competition, Oyshi is priced rather high. I am all for paying a pretty penny for pretty sushi, but I wouldn't categorize this place's sushi as such.  LOCATION: 4/5 The location is easy to find. There is ample parking here, too.",

There's nothing special, in my opinion, but my friend wanted to come to try one of their desserts (IKR?).   They only allow you to pick one dessert item (not including unlimited ice cream, though). Another friend stated when they came before they didn't have this restriction. Well, looks like it was just mochi ice cream for me then, which comes only in strawberry, by the way.   They have some daily specials so check out that list on the way to your table. Fish wasn't as shabby as anticipated so that was a plus. I love salmon nigiri but theirs wasn't too good, actually. So I definitely ate less than usual in that department.   In terms of hot tea, they charge you $2.50 for the pot at the table so I'm thankful it wasn't $2.50 per person :).   Overall, it's pretty much a just as expected / average place for me. In this area, it's not my to-go place for ayce sushi but hey, this visit just means I won't say no if another friend wants to eat here. :0)",

Finally!!! Were seated. No sever. No water, no edamame. Just a bunch of hungry thirsty bums still waiting.   It took forever to get water and edamame. The menu was extensive but boring. Most of the combo rolls seemed similar to other combo rolls minus or add one insignificant ingredient. I did very much enjoy the pork belly.   Even my Sapporo beer experience was ruined but my non-chilled glass. Did I mention I thought I was at a club with the music blasting techno? Geezus. Overall, it sucked.",

On top of that, you are only allowed to get one dessert. One thing that I like about this place is the fact that they don't make their rolls as if it was for 3 people. This gives you room in your tummy to try more items. Service was above average. They never fail to give you the wrong order at least once while you are dining with them. If you're looking to try a new AYCE sushi spot, try this place.",

    "text": "So what makes a great sushi restaurant?  Great Service, Nice entertaining sushi chefs and most of all yummy fresh cut fish!  Sadly Oyshi had NONE of these qualities.  First of all the hostess Kassidy was the rudest restaurant host I have ever encountered. We got there at 5:45 pm on Tuesday.  There were 12 open seats at the bar and many open tables.  She said there was a wait because there were not enough servers for any more guests and the next server comes at 6pm.  So we said we would wait till 6.  At the appointed time, she escorted us to the very end of the bar where there was no visibility of the fish cases or the chefs and there were 10 empty prime seats in the center of the bar.  Really?  When we questioned her, she rudely said, \"I don't make the rules, the bar for servers is split in 2\"   So the rules are  give the first guests to arrive for the evening the worst possible seat????  She reluctantly moved us and stomped away in a huff.  The server was only slightly more friendly.  Oh and guess what, you can't speak to the chefs.  You have to order through the server who only comes around rarely.  We decided to order a la cart instead of all you can eat because we prefer cut fish.     Unfortunately the albacore fish was gross and mealy and we had to send it back.  My poor husband ate a couple of pieces of it and paid the price this morning.  The other fish plates were cut thick and not refined.  Most of the fish is pre-cut in the case making it dry out.  I ordered a grilled hamachi kamma, (cheek) and was told it would take 20 minutes.  Well no wonder it came out overcooked and dry because it probably only needs to broil 5 minutes.  They also covered it in masago eggs which i hate and I had ask to have them removed.  The rolls had the TINIEST cut piece of fish I've ever gotten in a roll.   I asked for seared tuna nigiri and got the wrong order.   I also ordered eel nigiri and it was grilled eel but COLD,  so they also grill that ahead of time and serve it cold,  YUCK.  Its the fresh warm juicy eel that makes it good.  The \"rice\" under the nigiri was I'm not sure what.  It was not whole kernels of rice but some kind of rice paste.  I could not find one kernel of rice in it.  It tasted fishy and gross like rice pulp, elmers glue and fish water mushed up.  It was not edible.    At the end of our meal, the waiting area was full but there were 6 empty tables.  The hostess takes great pride in her little power of NOT SEATING guests.  I wanted to tell them RUN!  and save your money and your tummy.  Her bad attitude definitely sets off the experience to be bad. I have no idea how this place is popular when the only decent thing we ate was the edamame.    We only went here because our favorite place had no seating from being so full on a tuesday night at 5:30 pm.  Next time we will make reservations at our normal place and spare ourselves from this bad treatment and bad food.    I see other recent bad reviews so take note people....",

    "text": "I have always enjoyed Oyshi, ever since it opened years ago, I've been a huge fan! It was the first AYCE sushi place I had ever been to. And after all this time, they still serve up pretty yummy eats!  AMBIANCE: 3 - The space is intimate, but at the same time, still pretty well lit. Usually has a good amount of people inside, I recommend calling in advance, especially with a big party.  SERVICE: 4 - Service is okay, especially when you call in a big party reservation; everything came out fast and hot for our bday party celebration! It's also pretty fast seated at the bar.  when you're not at the \"party tables\", regular service is a bit slow! I really hope they get better, but it's been that way for a while. Also, they charged full price for a kid under 10! Say whaa?!   FOOD: 4 - I have a like/love relationship with the food. So I'll just tell you my absolute favorite dishes to order: Love Affair, Fresh Oysters, Baked Mussels, Japanese Lasagna Roll, Vegas Roll, Garlic Tuna nigiri, Oyshi Roll, Strawberry Mochi, Green Tea Ice Cream, and the Ahi Poke :) All delish and some of the best sushi around. Though, not a huge fan of all of the nigiri that they serve.  Oyshi is always a fun time for me, so I hope that everyone that has a big reservation or sits at the bar feels the same way as well!",

I have been going here for years and have seen it change over time physically, however the food is consistent - and that's why I go back!   It's located on Rainbow and Windmill which is literally less than a two minute drive from where I live. It's super convenient - the southwest area is developing like crazy so make sure to call ahead and make sure there's a table for you if you have a big group. Sometimes you have a wait a bit to get seated even for 2 people on a high volume day, but if call ahead it shouldn't be a problem. They've been improving seating people right away I have noticed the past few times. Prices are affordable and they also offer all you can eat. They have a private parking lot too.   Also, during the weekdays they have an awesome lunch special. I ordered their chicken teriyaki which was a generous serving with a California roll, miso soup, vegetable/shrimp tempura, and a house salad all for $12!!!! Who wouldn't be stoked about that?   Overall, this place is great. I recommend to anyon",

Many visits a couple years ago...all with slow service, room temperature nigiri, etc.  This was actually one of the only places that I told people NOT to go to for sushi....and never understood why others liked it so much.  A VERY reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!  A few highlights :  Sea Scallops were awesome! Super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth!   Sake was very fresh today! Beautiful cuts of salmon....the Sake in Yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.  The Ika with Mint. I really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most.   Ahi. Fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  Pic : <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ#UnVcwLiUog_Lmr-ZkUaKwQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/oysh...</a>  Unagi. Nice crispy edges...good flavor!   Ahi Poke. Tuna was fresh, and the seaweed salad was good too!  Sunomono. I liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. The ginger sauce was good too.  Green Tea Creme Brulee. Delicious! Lots of tea flavor here   Service was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.  I would come back again now if I was already on this side of town :P",

    "text": "So sad Sushi Factory closed down!! My group of 6 was looking for a buffet to eat after a fun, but exhausting day at Daylight and with it being July 4th weekend, we knew all the good buffets on the strip would have crazy waits. So, after finding out that Sushi Factory was closed, we got a recommendation from a friend to go here -- around $20 for AYCE sushi dinner, which included appetizers, rolls, nigiri, and dessert (only thing excluded was sashimi). Pretty good deal, especially for how extensive their menu is.  I wasn't really feeling like rolls, so I ordered and ate mostly nigiri -- so my 3 stars is based mostly on that. The pieces of fish were on the smaller side, and (obviously) the fish isn't the freshest you're going to find at a sushi joint (some of the uni looked a tad bit iffy, but I'm also on the paranoid side when eating raw stuff). But, if you're there more for the rolls and other items, I would probably give this place 4 stars.  Service was good, and it was easy to flag down our server whenever we wanted to order more food (which was often!).",

There was also tons of tables like 10+ and they still made me wait 30 minutes... for what?! The staff were just chatting, hiding behind the podium right by the kitchen. They also don't take reservations at the weirdest times. The hostesses are sooooo rude here and will ignore you unless you ask them for an update.  The staff spent more time cleaning the tables while there. There were probably 30 people waiting outside, because when I was seated there was 5 empty tables around me! The rolls are just okay, but their fish/sashimi was good, even though the servers DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE???? How do you confuse a white fish with octopus ?! Their prices for AYCE are pretty standard, not too cheap or expensive. The quality of the food is pretty good.  The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous of course and very roomy. They also have an incredible sake selection ranging from hot-cold, fruity-to house.",

But I decided to try something new. This place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. So they must be doing something right.  After one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by Following THE ARROWS...  Decor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. Great Location too. The VIP room and Lounge room was a nice touch. It was slow mind you, during lunch when I walked in with my \"friend\" Karlee. We started off with, my favorite Ahi Poke and Miso Soup. Karlee had the soup as well and Gyoza. Ahi Poke was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. Miso was good, not fantastic. Karlee loved the Gyoza, she said it was better than the other Sushi place she goes that serves it.   I had the J&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. It was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. I had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. All was great but the J&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, I couldn't have any because I am allergic to shrimp. She tried to Force Feed it to me, knowing I was allergic, I think she tried to kill me, because I tried to make fun of her Sirarcha/Hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and She had chicken teriyaki and I think another order of Gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.   The service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. This was all you can eat, and what I was shocked about how they did not serve Half rolls!! I was like WTF? how could I possibly try more than 3 types. Other than that The waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. No big deal. The Food was great, service was so-so, and It is a place I would come back to again. I also ate too much, because I regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to JUST one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons I came here for, Green Tea Tiramisu, I'm Coming back for you!",

    "text": "Oyshi definitely has one of the most expansive AYCE selections in Vegas. Lots of appetizers are also included, my favorite being the Surf and Turf. The fish is always very fresh, and their special rolls are inventive and delicious! There are a few reviews that specifically mention the Monster Roll. I like it, but I find it very difficult to eat due to the size. My favorites are the Sunrise Roll and the Hawaiian Roll.   I would avoid coming here during the lunch or dinner rush unless you're sitting at the counter, though...service tends to get really, really slow when they're busy and sometimes items from my order are forgotten. They do get very busy, so just keep that in mind.   Oyshi is by far the best sushi restaurant on the southwest side, and despite some slow table service during their busiest hours and some sloppy sushi-making when they are extremely busy during weekend dinners, I will definitely continue to frequent it when I'm in the mood for sushi.  Oh, and make sure to save room for dessert: the Green Tea Tiramisu is amazing!",

There were a few items that my friend and I ordered that did not taste right.  The raw oysters were strangely bitter.  We let the kind manager/owner know about this and he apologized and took the plate away immediately.  The uni that came out had an off yellowish-brownish color.  I've had plenty of uni to know how it supposed to look, but this was slightly different.   The star of the night was the agedashi tofu.  Yum yum yum.  Was quite tasty.  Another highlight of this AYCE meal is the fact that you can still chose a scoop of icecream along with whatever dessert you want.  I chose the green tea icecream and the creme brulee.  Was yummy.  The chefs, staff, manager/owner are all super friendly and the service is quick.  Food however...aight.",

It doesn't have the best sushi in town, so I usually just stick with the specialty rolls and hot dishes, which is a nice change of pace from time to time. If you are trying to satiate a serious nigiri craving, go somewhere else.   The potato croquettes, dynamite, buttery shrimp and scallop, yakitori, surf and turf, seared tuna and salmon skin are some of the regular menu items I order. I'm a fan of the amigo, red dragon and hawaiian rolls.   I wish they had a better happy hour deal, like Kobe and I'd probably visit this place a little more often.",

    "text": "I get why they have four stars, it's a hip place with electronica music playing in the background, and that seems to be a Vegas standard now.  However, I can't say ill be making my way back.  They have a variety to choose from for AYCE, with the whole inside menu strictly rolls.  When I do AYCE, I only go for nigiri.  As I've posted before, I'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  I guess it's what Americans love though... Sauce on everything.  I'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.  Anyway, the fish was really poor quality.  After my initial order, I couldn't bring myself to order any more.  I love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  The fish here had no taste whatsoever.  All I could taste was the vinegar from the rice.  I thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  There was no flavor at all.  It tasted like water.  It did not have that \"taste like the sea\" quality.  I don't know.  It just didn't taste like anything.  The baked mussels were not very good. Overcooked. No flavor.  Too chewy.  Tofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  Desserts were boring.  No green tea ice cream. Creme brulee was ok.  Ice cream parfait was ok.  Seriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.  I like the fact that they serve \"fresh\" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.    Server was friendly.    I'd pass on this place and go for Goymen, Sushi Komo, or even Kaya.",

    "text": "I've been to Oyshi on several occasions. The restaurant has been really hit or miss. The first time I went with my fiance and we sat near the window, close to the sushi bar. The quality was good and the service was prompt and friendly.  The second time we went we were put in the far corner, probably as far away from the sushi bar as you can get. The quality was still there but the service was terrible. We felt forgotten being so far away and it took a long time to get our first order. When doing AYCE we usually do a first round then inevitably get a second round. With the amount of time it took for the first, we didn't even want to wait for a second round. We left full from the tasty sushi, but disappointed with the service.   This last time we went was for the AYCE lunch. We sat close to the sushi bar, but it didn't matter. We ordered Miso and Edamame to start. The miso was brought very quickly, but we waited easily 30 minutes for our edamame. The waitress came back during our waiting to take our order for sushi. We placed our order and also asked about or edamame. She clearly forgot judging by her reaction.  The sushi came before our edamame and the quality was poor. The albacore was mangled on the rice and didn't taste fresh. Same with the Salmon.   The worst part about the last experience is that during our time waiting for edamame and sushi, we saw our waitress through the curtain in the kitchen eating food. Restaurant no-no 101.   I don't plan on returning. It's disappointing because I like the atmosphere, their selection on their menu (AYCE even includes oysters on the half-shell and Uni!)  On to better places.",

I've been here about 6 times and it's a bad experience most of the time. I wait for up to 30 minutes for my food. One time my server forgot to put in anything that I ordered so I didn't get my food for a whole 45 minutes.  I also had to wait to be seated for 20 minutes when I could clearly see that there were about a dozen free tables.  Also, one time I went there and the server recognized me from a week before. She remembered that I didn't tip so generously the last time I was there, so when we sat down, she told us \"I hope you tip more this time\". I believe that was extremely rude. It ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal.",

There was a great selection.  Since we had a big party, our order took some time and some got missed but the servers were more than helpful and they made sure we got everything we wanted.  After our meals they also had parfait, mochi, and tiramisu for dessert..I would definitely be coming back..Only downer is that it is pretty far from the strip if you don't have a car, its about a $30 cab ride, but if you split it, its not so bad.  After 2 hours of stuffing our faces and many bottles of sake, we left stuffed and satisfied and it only came out to $40 a person! We were expecting way more!",

You can always find a seat right off the bat (Which is a far cry from somewhere else Yama Sushi where I have waited up to 2 hours with a group of 6). The menu is much longer, and more unique than somewhere like Sushi Mon. The decor is pretty hip, staff very friendly. We go back at least once a month!",

    "text": "Went in with my girl for lunch and had a HORRIBLE dining experience.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for over 7 years and it has been awhile since I had such horrible service/food.    When we walked in, there was no host/hostess to greet/seat us.  After waiting for 2 minutes, we decided to seat ourselves at the sushi bar.  The restaurant was not packed but had a decent lunch crowd for a sunday.  Numerous servers passed by us and pretty much ignored us.  On top of that, there were 4 sushi chefs behind the counter who did not acknowledge us at all.  Probably after 5 minutes, the manager came by and asked us if we would like something to drink.  It took him probably at least another 5 minutes to grab us our waters.  After placing our order with him, it took another 15-20 minutes to get any of the sushi we ordered.  Talking from a server perspective, how hard is it to make sushi??? There is no cooking involved!  When we finally got our order, I was very disappointed.  The quality of the fish is very subpar and the portions are very small for the price.   All in all, the restaurant itself is nice and has a nice ambiance, but the customer service quality of the servers and sushi chefs are waaaaayy below average.  I would not recommend going here!!",

    "text": "My wife (who surprisingly doesn't eat seafood) was introduced to this place and she's addicted.  She gets all the egg rolls and teriyaki chicken and beef she can eat, and even some rolls without fish.  The all you can eat deal it great.  I leave feeling like I will never need to eat again.  The food is great, the service is good, and the Mochi desert is interesting.  Even the kids meal is quite large for being only $6.  If you want good sushi, this is your place.  They make the rolls after you order them so be sure to be patient and order several rolls at a time so you don't have to wait for a long time between orders.",

The portions are good and two rolls filled me up fast (so no I did not do the all-u-can-eat option! LoL) I think here and Kaizen have the best rolls in Vegas....for now atleast! And the decor is pretty modern and stylish so I especially enjoyed eating here! ;)",

    "text": "By far the best all-you-can-eat sushi places I have ever been to. My cousin, who lives in the area, claimed that this place has really good sushi and an even better all-you-can-eat deal. As I'm from San Francisco, I was a bit cautious and not too optimistic about the quality and freshness of the fish, however I was quickly impressed with the large variety of rolls, fish as well as other main entrees and appetizers on the menu. I started with the simple seaweed salad and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature. Typically I am a fancy, combo roll fan but I will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. The spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado. To finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. I'm always a fan of the green tea ice cream and in this instant the ice cream was superb.  Will def go back the next time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "Hubby and I were craving AYCE sushi and yelp app led me to Oyshi. $21 for the amount of food we had during lunch is no problemo.   I'm so glad we went. The selection on the AYCE list FAR surpasses any AYCE places I've been to in Cali. Tons of premium rolls, tons and tons of appetizer items (seaweed salad, asparagus tips), you can customize your own sushi, hand roll list is extensive. And the sushi itself is B-O-M-B!   I go to Vegas oftne and I'm so glad my relatives live near this place. I will be going here often. I can see it already. I wanna try the private dining areas for groups one day. Oh and props to the server, Angel. She knows her stuff and was very sweet and attentive!",

    "text": "first time here &amp; loved it!! probably one of the best all-you-can-eat sushi places I have ever ate! the only down side is its a bit pricey!! 21 for lunch &amp; 26 for dinner. but you get what you pay for! everything is made &amp; comes out fresh once you order it!  -miso soup delicious! wasnt salty at all! :)  -eel/avocado roll not a big fish person...but i have to admit was good! the eel overpowered the avocado for sure.  -salmon with rice  i dont eat raw fish or anything..but i had half of one piece and it wasnt bad at all!! it looked and tasted fresh! im sure all you salmon lovers would enjoy this very much.  -love affair shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster with crunch flakes &amp; masago!! this was my favorite roll of the night! I finished the majority of the plate!!   -crunch scallop yummy!! taste had a sweetness to it and this was my second fav of the night.  -beef asparagus delicious!! loved this and i would have eaten more if i wasnt so stuffed!! one of my favorites. simple but great!  -rib eye steak teriyaki steak was tender!  -asian skirt steak steak was tender and could taste the ginger like crazy in this dish! in fact, you can taste all the ingredients they used to make this dish, but the ginger enhances a bit.  -agedashi tofu lightly fried soft tofu in green onion soy sauce! really light and it was phenomenol. I dont think you can ever ruin this dish.  -green tiramisu sucked!!! never order this.  my auntie & uncle said their creme brulee, parfait is great! their rattlesnake roll is highly recommended!",
