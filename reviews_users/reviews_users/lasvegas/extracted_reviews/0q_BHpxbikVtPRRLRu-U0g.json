    "text": "A meal and a view fit for a king and his queen....or a couple of peasants who decided to spend some of their hard earned income tax dollars on a fancy meal.  Located at the beautiful Bellagio Hotel, Picasso's is a high end, Michelin star rated restaurant that has arguably the most romantic outdoor dining patio on the strip. The inside of Picasso is also beautifully decorated. They actually have numerous authentic Picasso paintings hung throughout the main dining room. The patio is located on the edge of Lake Bellagio, which gives the diners stunning views of the Lake Bellagio water fountain show, which runs every 30 minutes. Since we started our meal at dusk, and since the meal itself lasted over two hours, we were able to see the show numerous times. Being able to watch the water fountain show from a front row seat at night was breathtaking. It truly was the most romantic dining experience I've ever had. Just take a look at this picture if you doubt me <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/picasso-las-vegas?select=Hju2-fzyXGYgQEV7X-HY1Q#hWXe_6R825AQIv5CPmAkpQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pica...</a>  Picasso's has two types of menus. The first is a prix fixe that features four courses ($115 per). The second is a degustation menu that features five courses ($125 per). Since both menus offered different dishes, my wife and I decided to order one of each so we could try many of the dishes offered. Besides what you order, you also receive bread (four types to choose from), Amuse Bouche (before dinner) and Petit Fours and Truffles (after dessert). This is all we ate that magical evening;  Amuse Bouche- Raw Salmon Filled W/ Cream Cheese, Topped W/ Caviar, Hard Boiled Egg & Cucumber & a shot of Creamy Potato Soup  Bacon French Bread Manchego Cheese & Olive French Bread Maine Lobster Salad W/ Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette  Creme of Butternut Squash Soup W/ Amaretto Marshmallows & Mushroom Duxelles Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop W/ Potato Mousselline & Jus De Veau Sauteed Filet of Black Bass W/ Cauliflower Mousselline & Saffron Sauce  Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras W/ Roasted Almonds & Rhubarb Puree  Roasted Milk Fed Veal Chop W/ Rosemary Potato & Au Jus Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb W/ Pisto, Mint Aioli & Tempura Zucchini Flower Warm Chocolate Foudant W/ Coconut Gelato & Macaroons  Warm Petite Cinnamon Bun W/ Tangerine Cream, Rhubarb Tartlet & Cream Cheese Gelato Petit Fours  We each ordered a tasty martini to start the evening but I can't recall what they were made with. Sorry.    Because this review is already running long, I'll spare you detailed descriptions of each dish. I'll just tell you that everything we ate at Picasso's was exquisite, just as Kent D. said it would be. My meal at Picasso's definitely rates in my top five favorite meals of all time.  The service at Picasso's was top notch. Our silverware was exchanged with every new dish, our napkins were folded for us whenever we got up from the table, crumbs were removed from our table after almost every dish and the servers even offered to take our pictures in front of the fountain show.   As we were leaving Picasso, the hostess handed both my wife and I a small box with the restaurants name written on it. Inside was two individually wrapped banana chocolate chip muffins. I've never been to a restaurant that gives you a gift after dining with them. I thought that was a nice touch.   It's no shock that Picasso's has been awarded two Michelin stars two years in a row. It's a phenomenal restaurant with exquisite food and a breathtaking view.  If you're looking to impress that someone special in your life or are looking for a restaurant to celebrate a special occasion then look no further than Picasso.",

    "text": "I am pretty shocked to know this restaurant was a 2 star Michelin rated....but anymore..no wonder.   We sat outside patio and the moment I got seated I had  bad feelings..I was right.  There were lots of branches and leaves on the table fallen from the tree. Our servers looked like ex janitor and homeless men picked up on the Strip. Don't they have a dress code for guests?? Why not for servers??? Their service wasn't too bad but wouldn't you expect a clean, classy and sophisticated looking server at this level of restaurant???   Our server (his name was Jose I think) wasn't bad but sometimes he didn't listen to us well. He left before we were finished talking to him.   We got  Menu Degustation. First 2 courses were very good. Very refreshing  3rd course Foie Gras was ok. a little too fatty not smooth  For 4th course, I got lamb. I didn't like the sauce. The lamb was cooked perfectly and it was very tender but it had an awful smell. I couldn't finish. To be honest, I never really had lamb before but I wanted to try to see if I would like lamb or not. I tried it at this supposedly fancy restaurant and didn't like it so I guess lamb is not for me. If you love lamb, I'm sure you would like it here. It was prepared well.   Dessert was VERY BAD. I got disappointed because I saw nice photos of desserts on yelp and was looking forward to it. But none of the desserts on the list sounded good to me. I got Poached Pair with Ginger icecream......big mistake. It was so bad I couldn't eat at all and had to switch it with something else. I don't remember what its called. It was alright.   I shouldn't have sat on patio. The view wasn't as good as I thought and I've seen the water show millions of times. I missed out all those million dollar Picasso arts.   4 and half stars out of 360 reviews convinced me of coming here with high expectation but it's so sad that I didn't have the same experience as others. I grew up eating Kobe beef...(authentic, not the ones raised in US) I don't think I have bad taste in food...   This restaurant  was like, I got a 10 carat diamond engagement ring but it turns out to be a cubic zirconia...and they serve very limited menu so it's almost like mass production chain restaurant in a way. They serve the same food everyday.",

    "text": "70% Overall good but a bit inconsistent tasting dinner.  ***Short Review  Came here for their tasting dinner by myself during Aug '11. (6-courses @ approx $120, plus a $60 wine pairing).  My dining experience here was a bit of a mixed bag. Quality of cooking ranges from close to perfection (U-10 scallop) to dismal (Wagyu Fillet Mignon). Style of cooking is relatively old fashioned. Some of the food presentation was ostentatiously gaudy. Wine pairings here were very effective & not to be missed.  Value is reasonable, if you stick to the tasting & pairings alone. I just wouldn't recommend adding their Wagyu Steak. It's not very good, and it's just too much food.  Ambiance is very comfortable and not uptight. I especially enjoyed the Bellagio water shows right outside the restaurant. Decor, like the cuisine, is also a bit old fashioned.  Service is superb, it's very attentive & personable. Picasso is very organized and the pacing is consistent. Sommalier and waiter were very friendly & informative. There are few places more efficiently run than Picasso.  Detailed review will go into each dish further plus other thoughts on the restaurant.  ***Detailed Review  Picasso was really a mixed bag for me.  Going with their tasting menu, some of their first dishes were really great.  Unfortunately things became progressively less impressive as further dishes arrived.  I also feel that, relative to other tasting dinners I've tried, Picasso's cooking somehow feels more old fashioned, as if I've time traveled back to the 1990's.  Having had the chance to visit Pierre Gagnaire's Twist & Joel Robuchon the same week, I did not feel that Picasso was at the same level of creativity or consistency.    About the food, if you're not used to tasting dinners (and don't mind foie gras), this wouldn't be such a bad place to start.  The flavor's are generally accessible, and the wine pairings are so effective, that I feel most will be able to enjoy.  On the the food;  I started with a pair of amuse bouche dishes, which I thought were good but again, somewhat conservative.  No formal names were given on the menu, so I made them up in my attempt to best describe the dishes.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4N3sWH8aBaBHWEVm1w3k0A&userid=OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  'Leek soup with almonds'. (Dish rating 75%.)    Pleasant, delicate, and straightforward flavors that highlight the two ingredients.  temperature slightly chilled.  light and refreshing.  Very good soup.    'Salmon with egg and caviar'. (Dish rating 40%.)    I felt this wasn't memorable.  It tasted almost exactly as mentioned, but with some boiled egg in the center. rolled in.  The salmon is quite delicious, but the caviar is obscured.  Very pedestrian amuse.  'Maine Lobster Salad' Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette Wine Paring, 2009 Weinhof Arndorfer, Riesling, Reserve, Strasser Weinberge, Kamptal, Austria (Dish rating: 93%)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=unnPfYFPGjxv3IME3ieuew&userid=OWtjsyPKWUu7La7uOyC6Rw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  I felt this really wasn't a salad in the conventional sense in that there a lot of lobster with a bit of greens on top.  Nonetheless, it was great lighter, refreshing dish.  It was a wonderful way to start after the duo of amuse bouche.  The lobster itself was great.  Chunks of lobster meat is arranged to resemble a cake of sorts.  The lobster is very juicy, and delicate.  Texture wise, it was quite tender for lobster.  It's served with a more chilled temperature, and portion size was generous.    The condiments are well thought out as well.  The dish is complemented by sweet flavors from some melon.  The  greens were not as generous as I would have preferred, although they do give the dish a more crispy texture.  Red peppercorns, another integral condiment, add wonderful subtly peppery finish.  Like the greens, however, I do wish there were more peppercorns.   In terms of wine parings, I was given a dry citrus-like Reisling, that thankfully wasn't too sweet.  It took an already accomplished dish to another level.  Very good balance of savory, sweet , citrus & spicy flavors.  Continued, please refer to 'earlier review'.",

    "text": "Listen you have to appreciate good food to eat in a place like this and drop about $200 per person. People who complain about Picasso really have no wright to, well maybe if they have personality conflicts with waiters. But listen my dinner was FLAWLESS. There were 3 tasting menus when I was there. a $125, a $115, and a $250 dollar one. Wine matchings extra. So be prepared to spend some money. I would not hesitate to go back again. I would ask to be seated on the terrace next to the fountains....spectacular. Or seated inside by windows to view the fountains I liked it better than Le Cirque. This is truly a food experience worth the price of admission.",

Bread: thumbs up Butter: meh...this was ok. I'm picky when it comes to butter. Bouchon has great butter. Here was ok...if i'm going to ruin my waist line on butter, I'm only going to eat great butter.  OYSTERS: seconds please! Thank goodness my boyfriend got his own dish of oysters because this dish was too good to share.   FOIE GRAS: wine pairing was spot on with this dish. The sweetness of the wine, pineapple sides cut the \"fatness\" of the foie gras.   WAGYU BEEF: extra $40 for this but worth it. I'm not even a beef person...and this dish had me by the first bite  LOBSTER: the boyfriend had this for an extra $40 and it was a lovely dish as well. We  both enjoyed our main course picks. Sides of veggie were yummy too.   DESSERT: I had the flourless cake with Guinness ice cream and craving this dish as I write this. Bf had the grape concord panna cotta. Was good but I liked mine more. His was light, fruity, and \"girly.\"  Wine pairing: who ever is in charge of this is spot on! Wine pairing was perfect perfect perfect.   p.s. service...I don't know why other reviewers gave low stars when it came to food service...but our service was a 5 star. Don't expect to be out of there within an hour. It's a nice romantic dinner...just like any other fine dining experience.  Thank you for the food heaven experience!!",

    "text": "After scouring the various options before going out to Vegas, my fiancee and I decided to settle on Picasso after looking online at the menu. What is not necessarily apparent right off is that you have to request sitting outside on the patio if the weather is nice enough for it. You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains - but from the other side of the tourists - which give it an even better backdrop with the replica Eiffel Tower, the 'Paris' balloon, and the modernist Cosmopolitan/Aria buildings. I was shocked that the restaurant was pretty empty when we came for our 6:30 PM reservation on Friday evening (and it wasn't appreciably more crowded when we left)...but the setting is in a class by itself when you are outside. Maybe you don't appreciate having your conversations stopped every 15 minutes, but it was a fantastic setting for dinner. Our servers were prompt with service, pouring water and serving the dishes in a well-timed fashion.  One of my concerns when looking at the menu was that there weren't many options to choose from for dinner. I went with the prix fixe as a result, as I felt that afforded me more options (as my fiancee did the Degustation). Starting out with poached oysters was a great choice - it's four oysters, in the half-shell, presented with generous amounts of caviar and vermouth-infused broth. I'm not sure it's quite the equivalent of how Per Se treats oysters and caviar as a pairing, but it was so delicious - the sumptuousness of the oyster paired with the rich broth and the bursts of saltiness from the caviar - and the presentation in the half-shell was very unique. My fiancee's lobster salad was also very good. It's presented much more as a tartare with a light dash of flavoring, really allowing you to take in the deliciousness of the lobster, which tasted as fresh as if it had been caught that morning in the ocean. We both had delicious foie gras, albeit presented in different ways. The torchon was really well-done, presented with a toasted piece of brioche (although thinner than I would have thought) with caramalized pineapples and a dash of fruit (I want to say it was cherry) sauce. I really like the intensity of fruit with the torchon, so I wish there was more of the cherry, but the pineapples worked as a nice contrast to the richness of the foie as well. My fiancee's foie came out in seared fashion - it really does look like a steak, given how much is served - with an intense rhubard that really worked well with the bursts of juiciness that come with each bite. Her other appetizer (the scallops) were also delicious with regards to preparation. For the entree, we both went with red meats - I with the milk-fed veal chop, she with the lamb loin. Both were cooked to perfection; I really liked the veal served with au jus, which magnified the succulent flavors of the meat.  To be honest, I forget the desserts offhand (my memory ain't what it used to be, but they were both delicious), and the chocolate chip mini-muffins given as a bite for the next morning were so freakin' good. I'd come back here in a heartbeat - not only for the view, but the food here is really good. Given that I'm sure most of the food is sourced from somewhere other than Las Vegas (I can't imagine there are many farms in the desert), I can understand the relative consistency of the menu. But everything is so well-executed that I wouldn't mind coming back and having virtually the same meal again. For the price ($115-125, depending on which menu you eat), it is a relative bargain compared to some spots in NYC, and their cocktails and wine selection hold up to snuff as well. I would've been surprised ahead of time to hear that they have 2 Michelin Stars, but after eating here, I fully understand why.",

    "text": "Lovely. For a belovedly low-class town, a seat on the outdoor terrace by the lake is perhaps the classiest seat in Las Vegas. Pictures don't do it justice -- sitting for a 2-hour meal on a warm summer's evening, as the sun sets and the Bellagio fountain lights go on, enjoying dish after dish of exquisitely presented French dishes... I've had equally good food elsewhere, but never in such a mesmerizing setting.  And yet the terrace isn't even as famous as the dining room, which is lined with Picasso's original works. Given the obvious theme of the restaurant I was afraid it would be over-the-top, but the dining room is actually quite restrained and elegant. Some of the paintings might be brightly-colored Cubist pieces, but the decor is otherwise hushed. Although we ate outside for dinner, after the meal we sat at the bar beneath the glow of backlit liquor bottles and a large Picasso portrait. Again, if you were to describe this scene to me on paper I'd find it cheesy and pretentious, yet the experience was anything but.  When we first arrived we were briskly seated on the terrace, right by the water. The wait staff obliged us by taking multiple photos as we waited for our server. We opted first for a couple glasses of red -- she, a Taken 2009 cabernet, and I had an Eola Hills 2010 Oregon pinot noir that was VERY good. $17 per glass, so it's pricey but in keeping with the rest of the menu.  A small gripe was that our server wore a very dirty jacket, with stains and dust up and down both sleeves. No idea what was going on there. Also, it's been commented on by others -- and it does sound like a first-world problem to the nth degree -- but the bread was mediocre and of limited selection, which is disappointing only because of how much you're paying for the meal.  The dishes themselves were delicious. I went with the tasting menu, while my girlfriend ordered soup, asparagus with morels, and short rib from the prix fixe menu. There's only a $10 difference between the two, except the tasting menu adds an extra dish and more unique offerings, so I'd recommend the degustation.  Highlights from the food were the lobster salad, the morels, the U-10 scallop (just one large scallop, but *perfectly* seared, wow), and the short rib. The tasting menu comes also with what's probably the signature dish -- a seared \"steak\" of foie gras, which is literally a whole fatty duck liver. It's probably not a good sign when the server places a dish in front of you and says, \"I don't want to tell you how much cholesterol is in this, because your girlfriend would get upset.\" It's also probably not a good sign when you're a cardiologist and the server says this to you. As for the foie gras itself, it's as decadent as it sounds -- far too rich for my taste, but incredibly tasty and well-prepared if foie is what you like.  Dessert was wonderful, and also the most artfully presented of all the courses. My girlfriend ordered the pears poached in chai, with a side of ginger ice cream. This dessert is GREAT, and I would recommend it highly. We also overheard the couple at the next table saying that the blackberry cheesecake is delicious. I had chocolate passion fruit cremeaux, paired with butter rum ice cream. I've never had anything quite like it: a bite at first tastes like passion fruit but then finishes like chocolate. Also good, but not as good as the poached pear.  Finally, it's worth repeating just how spectacular a sight it is to be right next to the fountains at nightfall. Paris and the Cosmo lit in the back, with a different water show every 15 minutes. We were lucky that it wasn't especially windy, so we only had to protect our food from the spray once or twice. But even if it were more breezy, I'd do it all over again. And for about $150 per person (before tax and tip), while it's certainly expensive yet appropriate, I think, for the entire experience that you're paying for. Absolutely unforgettable.  **As an added bonus, Chef Julian Serrano visited our table before our meal and took pictures with us. Then, as we were enjoying a drink afterwards, he came up to the bar and chatted with us for a good 15 minutes about the food scene in San Francisco (he trained at Masa's) and the differences between seafood in Las Vegas (shipped directly from the East Coast overnight) and the West Coast proper (crappy seafood). Nice guy.",

My favorite dish was the poached oysters, which was absolutely delicious when I tried it on my fist visit to Picasso. Even that didn't  taste the same, it's was not  poached completely and it had a weird taste to it. We were there with 8 people l, the service was outstanding but the food is just not good for the amour we paid. The stars I gave are for the service, decore(Picasso artwork) and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll ever go back there.",

    "text": "We went to Picasso last night for dinner on our last night in Vegas.  The restaurant was beautiful and had wonderful views of the bellagio fountains.  A small gripe- I booked my reservations months in advance requesting a table by the windows and letting them know we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.  We were not given a window table, even after I asked, and I saw empty tables by the window that were never filled.  They also never acknowledged our anniversary, which again is not the end of the world.  We both ordered the 5 course tasting menu, although none of the menu options were explained to us.  The 1st course, the main lobster salad, was amazing and so fresh.  I loved it!  The bread was ok- not hot, which I would expect at a place of this caliber.  The 2nd course, the scallop, was good but not amazing.  Honestly, I had scallops that were a little better at Lakeside earlier that week.  The 3rd course, the foigras was amazing and the rhubarb sauce was perfection.  The 4th course- mine was the lamb, was by far the best I have ever had by far.  Super tender and melts in your mouth.  My husband had he halibut which was good but not amazing.  Dessert was good but again- looked better than it tasted- I had cheesecake and my husband had chocolate fondant.    Overall, the food and service were great, but if I'm comparing it to Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon, there is simply no comparison.  Both Guy and Robuchon are in a different league, so I find it odd that they are compared so often and priced similarly (at least to Guy).  At both Guy Savoy and Robuchon, we were offered dozens of bread options from a cart and a cheese selection that was unreal.  Then we were also offered a candy/dessert cart.  At Picasso, we were not offered cheese unless you wanted it in lieu of dessert and for 14 up charge.  I also mentioned to the waiter that I wish I could do cheese and dessert, and he sort of shrugged and said it is a hard decision.    I'm just saying for hundreds of dollars at dinner, I ought to get whatever I want right?  Anyway, I think Picasso is awesome and the food is outstanding.  However it's not on par with other French dining options and the service is a bit standoffish.",

Every big name restaurant has its defining item that I take with me into my foodie memory.  I wanted Picasso's to be something grand, like the \"barely cooked salmon\" at Le Bernadine but though everything was great (vegetarians must all want a puree of some vegi under some well cooked vegetable) nothing was as exceptional as their Raisin Bread.  Got 4 stars because it was good but was only remarkable for the memories of family and the bread... Well the poached pear desert did come in a close second to the bread.  I was later told that the chef is intentional about and enjoys preparing his dishes with the favors of the food items as the flavor profile.  I wish I had known this prior to eating there.  I would have still eaten there but my pallet would not have felt as cheated in flavoring as it did.  For a premium price I desired to be wowed.  It was exceptional quality and very pleasant wait staff.  If you like exciting, explosive, remarkable flavors, this is not the place.  If you like quality, skillfully prepared food, you will be satisfied.",

    "text": "Taking living the high life to a whole another level (like just about everything else at The Bellagio), Picasso allows you to enjoy the fine works of the art Master Picasso, while dining on culinary genius simultaneously. Located in the luxurious Bellagio, Picasso is one of my favorite upscale restaurants in fabulous Las Vegas.   Everything about Picasso radiates excellence- the service is impeccable, large selection of fine wines and liquors, and the pre-fixe menus are definitely not super size me portions, but perfectly portioned for you to enjoy your meal... to the very last scrumptious bite. To many, I guess the dishes are a little on the small side, especially for the price. If you decide to come to Picasso, be sure to make a reservation early enough so that you can request for a table with a view of the famous Bellagio Fountains show during your dinner.  When my family and I come to Vegas for a family vacation, we always reserve a night for dinner at Picasso. It is everything you want in a Michelin Starred restaurant- it's elegant, intimate, delicious, above amazing service, and of course, expensive. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with comfortable furniture, and subtle details that compliment Picasso's rare exquisite paintings that hang on many walls of the restaurant. Even the presentations of the dishes are works of art themselves... both in taste and look.  A dinner at Picasso has a base price of $115 per person, so this definitely is not the place if you're on a budget. This is Las Vegas after all... I mean, go big or go home, right?  Although the pre-fixe price might deter many, the cultural and culinary experiences Picasso has to offer over the course of your meal is absolutely worth every hundred. I am looking forward to my trip to Vegas this summer because I cannot wait to book my dinner at Picasso!  ** Michelin Star",

Its at the Bellagio, it's got a view of the fountains, and there are original Picasso paintings scattered around the restaurant.  So you think, shyte!--this place has to be good, right?    The Picasso folks forgot one little detail.  If you are gonna charge $500 for a dinner for two, the food should be at least decent.  The food at Picasso lacked the luster and appeal of even a mediocre or average Las Vegas restaurant.  It just didn't pop the way gourmet food usually does.  There is nothing specifically bad for me to point to about the food--it's more like one of those \"you-know-it-when-you-see-it\" type of things--and the dishes here just didn't bring it.  The VERY limited options in the menu didn't help either.  If you ask me, you are better off going a little less \"foofy\" and a little more \"yummy\" and pass on this place.  The Bellagio has several other restaurants that are delicious and much less expensive.",

    "text": "Celebrated my friend's birthday here last night in Vegas.  This was definitely a memorable dining experience.  From the moment we walked in to the final gift pastries they left us with.  My friend had dietary restriction of no pork products and they accommodated us ahead of time and remembered all of our preferences.  A True 5 star experience.  I had the 4 course prixfixe menu while my friend had the 5 course degustation menu.  I had quail salad, fois gras cold mousse, veal chops while my friend had the lobster salad, scallop, seared fois gras and lamb chops.  This was my friend's first time in Vegas and his first multi course French dining experience, but it's my 20th time in Vegas, both of us were equally impressed, perhaps for slightly different reasons.  The ambience of the restaurant is also spot on, over looks the Bellagio fountains, genuine Picasso on the walls, upscale but not uptight, it really was just done right.  The dessert was the highlight, my friend ordered the beggars purse, which is risotto combined with chocolate mousse in a soft and crispy filo pastry.  They hand written Happy Birthday on the plate and the overall presentation was exquisite.  Now onto the wine list... Oh boy the wine menu was thicker than a school lecture book.  My friend didn't drink so we did not go for the wine pairing which I now regret, because the sommelier was amazing for the party next to us as I overheard his recommendations.  I will definitely try that next time.  I did have a glass of 2007 Syrah to go with my meal which was excellent.  The check came out to be about 300+ for two including tip.  It's comparable to other fine french dining such as Masas in SF.  I truly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone looking for a special dining experience in LV.",

We had an ideal table just next to the large windows over looking the Bellagio fountains.   We both opted for the degustation menu and wine pairings.  Our amuse was delicious and perfectly seasoned, but the first course of Lobster Salad was a bit bland.  Our sommelier, who did an excellent job answering questions and explaining the pairings had said he paired such a dry white with the salad because of the strong acidity in the dressing.  The wine was excellent, but the salad only had a small bit of vinaigrette under the salad with the rest dressed in more of a basic aioli.  There were avocado balls and grape tomato halves that had not been seasoned at all.  The lobster was sweet and tender, but would have benefited from a little salt or acid. The second course of scallops was dead perfect.  This more than made up for the salad as the scallop had a gorgeous sear outside and a creamy-tender interior.  The accompanying potato mousseline and chip were fantastic. The foie paired with rhubarb was just right and I chose the halibut for my main selection.    I could eat this dish, with fresh asparagus, over and over.   Our server was very attentive and had a great personality. I was pleased that we could select from the full dessert menu to accompany the tasting and they sent us home with some petit fours.  Overall, their menu is a bit old school, but it is mostly executed perfectly.  For two, it was close to $500 even before tip, but was a very memorable meal.",

It felt uninventive and quite frankly, boring. It's all been done before and felt really standard for a restaurant of that caliber.  To sum it up, there are plenty of better restaurants in Vegas to go to if you want to spend that kind of money. It's not that it was bad per se... it just really wasn't all that remarkable.

    "text": "Picasso is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Why blow $400 gambling and be left with nothing, when you can experience Chef Julian Serrano's cuisine instead?  The ambiance is second to none in Vegas. Requesting a window seat is an absolute must - it gives you an intimate, private view of the Bellagio fountains. Real Picasso artwork, worth millions, watches you from the walls as you eat. Especially notable is the Picasso behind the bar - it's one of the most unique in Vegas.  For dinner, you choose between either the 4-course Degustation menu ($123) or 3-course Prix Fixe menu ($119). Wine pairings are offered for an additional $63 or $55, respectively.   My advice to you regarding the wine pairings is this - SPEND THE MONEY. Not only will a master sommelier entertain you with the history of each wine before pouring you a glass, but you'll also get to taste wines with extremely limited production runs (ex. only 100 bottles made each year).  The flavor of the wine, when paired with the food simply needs to be experienced to be believed. The best illustration of this was the sauteed \"A\" streak of foie gras. The peaches in the dish, paired with the muscat grape and cinnamon flavors in the wine, made it the best dish I have ever eaten in my life.  Must-haves include the foie gras, deer, quail salad and the Colorado lamb. While the dishes are not huge, you will not leave Picasso hungry. All-you-can eat bread, complimentary amuse bouche h'oeuvres and a complimentary tower with bite size desserts will be served.  Highly recommended - 5 stars.",

    "text": "Where to start ??? Let put it this way, A True Home Run !!!!!!!!   We had 5:30 reservations as we were going to see O after dinner. When we checked in the hostess greeted us and asked us to step into the lounge until the second host returned to seat us, we never got to the lounge area itself as the hostess came back.  As we made our way through the restaurant the hostess asked how our evening was and made small talk with us, most of the time a host appears to run off in front of you and then waits at the table, at Picasso they have it down, very personnel as they seat, great care taken with the guest.  Our waiter came to table brought the menu and the wine list, asked if we wish for a cocktail or champagne while we read through the menu, also asked about our water preference, excused himself. The bus boy came with bread a selection of 3 breads and all were warm. The sommelier noticed me reading the wine list and was quick to come to our aid. He help my wife and I and made some suggestions, when we explained that only my wife was having wine and what she like he asked if he could make a selection for her to which she agreed, and she loved the wine he selected.  Dinner itself was amazing. We had the chef menu. They brought us an amuse which was a chilled leek soup with a grouse croquette. WOW is all I can say, flavors explode in your mouth  1st course was Lobster Salad with Apple Vinegar. I am not a lobster fan at all but if you made it like this every time I would eat it all the time.  2nd course was Pan seared Scallop. Perfect, lightly seasoned and cooked just right, there was a light translucent center.  3rd course was Foie Gras. Nice sixe portion and a crisp crouton served with fresh black cherries, so good and lucky me my wife is not a fan of Foie so I got more  Main course, my wife had Halibut and totally enjoyed it. I had the Wagu Filet for an up charge but it was so worth it.  The desserts were amazing. My wife had the black berry cheese cake and I had a Hassel nut chocolate cake.   This is so worth going and we will go back but a word of caution this is price, don't mean to offend anyone but it may not be for everyone.",

    "text": "One of the greatest meals of all time (not exaggerating either). Had the three course prix fixe menu (note the only have prix fixe menu in either 4 or 3 courses) with wine pairing.   The first course was a quail salad with an amazing Piniot Gris from France. The second was a foie gras with the size of a filet minon. The second wine was like a port which went well with the foie gras. Had the veal chop as the main course which melted in my mouth. The third wine was tasty but didn't compare to the first two.  Meal and service were amazing. I'd definitely go back. This $250 meal was definitely a steal.",

    "text": "Just awful... mediocre dishes for an over-rated dining experience.  Perhaps this dates me, but if you slightly remember the show \"In Living Color,\" their service gets a big fat... HATED IT!  Read my reviews and you'd know that I've had my fair share of 5-diamond, 4-figure dining experiences for two.  This certainly was no 5-diamond, perhaps a cubic zirconia would be more appropriate.  Why, you ask?  ...Well, overall, there was a lack luster of service.  Aside from Robert Smith, the master sommelier, which seemed to make us feel like he really cared, no one gave us the time of day.  (Definitely not typical of 18-point Gault Millau, 2-star Michelin caliber.)  We had reservations for 6:30, for a party of three, and requested for a lakeview, upon calling.  Instead, we got the closest thing to the door, with the third person facing the entry so all the world could see what he was eating.  l noticed that there were several available tables for the same number seating.  So, I asked the hostess for a different table.  She immediately said, we have nothing available.  (Whaa?  Not even a \"let me go see what I can do\" and pretend to ask the head host.)  So, we asked them to move the third seat to against the entry, which would somewhat enclose our \"eating circle.\"  We went for the $110 tasting and $65 per person pairing.  OMG!  From one plate to the next, they were pushy.  This gave us the impression that it wasn't a 5-diamond experience, but a cheap Chinese restaurant that's constantly trying to get you out of the door and pay your bill ASAP.   One person didn't know what the other was doing, forgetting requests like lime or a sherry with dessert.    If it wasn't for the \"break\" we requested before dessert and stepped out onto the patio for a full fountain show and Cuban cigars, we would have choked.  Lastly, or perhaps, I should have started with this.  I couldn't even believe that they DIDN'T ASK \"Does anyone have any allergies?\" ...which is pretty standard for a restaurant of that gauge.  I had to walk over to our table waiter (yes, I had to walk over because they never seemed to stick around long enough to listen or even noted that you were giving them the eye) and inform him that my boyfriend had a nut allergy.  To cap off this dinner, I inquired with the Bellagio on whom was the current manager.  They informed me that it was Gilles Kolakowski, to which I wrote a letter of my displeasure.  And, much to my dismay, we didn't even get an apology.  In fact, I never heard back from them. ===============================================  Oh, and if I may judged it strictly on the plate, it's still a one star.  First course: The lobster salad was OK, absolutely nothing spectacular.  Second course: The seared scallop was cooked well, but the potato sail was uncomplimentary in flavour... perhaps Chef Serrano placed it there for texture, but it was more distracting in flavour.  ...And, that's not good!  Third course: I admit they do have the best foie gras in Vegas.  But, that's all.  Fourth course: The bass was over cooked, very tough.  And, I can't believe that they served this course in a 5-in tall (plain white) bowl!  The fish had a sauce, but it wasn't soup.  Thoughts like, \"Did they run out of plates?!\" ran through my head.  Fifth course: Ordered \"the custard\" trusting the chef and his staff to redeem themselves.  However, unsurprising, the dish gave all my senses the impression that it was decadent flourless chocolate cake.  Obviously, they gave me the wrong order.  DECADENCE DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE FOR INCOMPETENCE. Save yourself the few hundred dollars and hit the tables instead.  The hospitality and service is better there, tenfold.  =============================================== Several people tell me that they've gone and had a better experience.  All I have to say to that is... the mark of a good restaurant is consistency.  Food and service should always be top notch, and I didn't find either on my visit.  Also, I read that Robert Smith was nominated by the James Beard Foundation for best sommelier this year.  He didn't win, but perhaps this awful restaurant had something to do with it.... lmao.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. Sure, everyone likes being contrary once in a while, but it's gotten pretty old to me. I don't like whipped cream or the OC or Will Ferrell, so I sometimes feel very ostracized. This means that when everyone says a restaurant is going to be amazing, I really want it to be amazing.   And, for the most part, Picasso was. The amuse-bouche (formally known to me as the small amount of free food you get at the beginning of a really fancy meal) was a doll's sized cup of roasted pepper soup, and smoked salmon on the side topped with a tiny bit of tiny caviar. I'm completely obsessed with smoked salmon either way but I'm pretty sure this was high quality. The wine was also good and in general the degustation menu was stunning (though, of course, also doll's sized): lobster salad with truffle-apple-champagne vinaigrette (and I usually hate things with apple besides plain apples) followed by grilled foie gras, then roasted lamb (my choice), and then dessert.   To me the foie gras was overpowering. Accompanied by a small block of quince and a few miniscule huckleberries, it should have been light and rich at the same time. Usually when I eat foie gras, it's so delicious that I forget all the horror stories about how it's made, but this was so pungent and creamy that I couldn't stop thinking about those little geese being cruelly overfed.   The lamb I had was quite delicious, though a few of the pieces were overcooked (I ordered it rare). For that step of the menu my boyfriend chose turbot, which was definitely overcooked. It's one thing to slightly overcook red meat, but I think it's basically criminal to overcook nice fish at a very fancy restaurant.  This is going to sound crazy--and fine, it is--but my two main problems were with the bread and the service. The bread was mediocre! It's so easy to get delicious bread and warm it up before you serve it! The quality of this bread fell somewhere between the free bread you get when you buy soup and the bread you can buy for half off at the end of the day. In other words, it wasn't terrible, but it was nowhere near delicious.   The service was weird. It's like there were all these people running around who worked there but could not see us. They did a great job with the whole \"I see you trying to get my attention but something extremely important is happening six inches behind you and just to your left\" thing. Normally I don't mind this--I love being left alone--but it took us a while to be allowed to order, and all the food took a long time to come, and the only time we really got attention was right before we got our bill. In my paranoid moments I think we got this service b/c we only ordered one glass of wine.   I'm happy to report that the desserts were delicious. We had the apple whatever beignets everyone talks about, and loved them, and then also this blueberry parfait thing that came with lemon cream and blueberry sorbet and slightly orange-flavored thin cookies.   I would recommend eating here if someone is taking you out to eat; otherwise, I'd try Sensi instead (also in the Bellagio).",

    "text": "OK. let me start out by saying my review is for regular folk. If you are really into classy restaurants and really understand french food and have a very advanced pallet, then you should really stop reading this. If you are normal and well seeded in the middle class financially and socially, then keep reading. I got your back on this one.   You are limited to just two options here. The crazy expensive 4 course meal and the CRAZY EXPENSIVE 5 course meal. While the entree might have 2-3 options, everything else is the same. The portions are the smallest you will ever have. If the menu say scallops, take that as a single scallop. This is pretty normal for ortsy tortsy places. Now onto the costs. Be prepared to pay $225 per person easily. It is one of the longest and most expensive restaurant experiences. If you want to do an ultra classy dinner for a super special occasion, this is definitely your spot. This is one of those spots where you can check off your bucket lists. but be prepared to spend, spend, and SPEND!   ***** If you can ask for a seat outside if it is not too hot. It overlooks the fountain and that is an amazing backdrop over a meal.***********",

As a former F&B Director in San Diego and Las Vegas, I have a pretty good idea on this restaurant. I have eaten in Picasso probably 10 times. And it's still as great as it was 20 years ago when the Bellagio opened. Chef SERRANO, who I knew from Masa's in San Francisco is still the epitome of pure class and extraordinary cuisine.  I could write for the next 15 minutes on the cuisine but take my word for it, one will never forget it. I would like to thank LUZ LOPEZ who is the Executive Assistant for the CULINARY department for helping me with my future wife's birthday and engagement.  LUZ went above and beyond anything I could have asked for. And I thank you. I'll be getting married on the 22nd of December and I've already made my reservation with Picasso. Would like to book a Room Suite as well. I look forward to seeing everyone again. Thank you.",

I ordered the quail salad, the salmon, and the roasted pigeon!  My sister got the fois gras, deer medallions and the oysters with caviar.  Luckily she wasn't very hungry so I got to eat almost all of it!  The quail was really good, the salmon was solid and the hand cut potatoes were very tasty and flavorful.  The salmon had a nice crispy skin.  The best thing that I had was the roasted pigeon!  I know it's hard to believe that a pigeon would taste good!  But my god that was the best bird I've ever had!  Absolutely insane!  The deer medallions were also incredible!  They were not gamey at all and were extremely tender!  They would actually melt in my mouth!  This meal was the first time I've ever tasted an oyster and my goodness they were absolutely delicious and flavorful.  This was one of the best overall meals of my life!  Loved every second of it!  Service was impeccable!  Also got the wine pairing.  Very tasty selections!  Loved sitting in front of the fountains and getting splashed by them!  Awesome experience!",

    "text": "I can't say much about Picasso that hasn't already been said. This was my finest dining experience in the US by a good margin (Only a certain meal in Japan can best it). My girlfriend surprised me with reservations here for my birthday. It just so happens I've had my eye on the place since I moved to Vegas as it has earned great praise over the years and is relatively reasonably priced for a place that was recognized as a two star Michelin restaurant when they last rated in Vegas.  I was excited to try the Degustation menu as it had a lot of courses that I wanted to try anyway. Every course was delicious, but I truly enjoyed both the scallop dish and the lobster salad. The lamb was fantastic, and the foie gras was rich buttery goodness.  One of the highlights of Picasso is obviously the view, where you can be up close to the Bellagio fountain shows. I generally think sitting inside is more comfortable, but this is one of those restaurants where you might want to sit outside to enjoy the fountains. That being said, it will be much noisier if you choose that route.  Their dessert menu is actually quite extensive and I went with the mousse cake. I was surprised by the size of the portion, considering that most of the courses were petite. I was given quite the slab of cake! Accompanying it was a nicely written Happy Birthday message as well as a candle. The cake itself was rich and delicious, but a little too much as I couldn't quite finish it. Sometimes fine dining leaves you a little hungry - Picasso probably will not.  Ironically, I read Lena C's review beforehand so I knew that the richness of the menu might get to my tummy, so it was nice to be forewarned!  All in all, this was a fantastic and extended experience that makes you appreciate the effort that they put into the details of the restaurant itself. From the waiters, to the paintings, to the parting present, this is not a meal to forget anytime soon.",

When I made the reservation, I asked for a very nice table, and they gave us one right next to a window so we could watch the Bellagio Fountain show just outside five or six or more times during our meal. It was magical.  There are many, many reviews of this restaurant - please note the other 5 star reviews if you'd like to have an idea of what your in for.  The highlights for us were the poached oysters, which I can only describe as \"luxury clams\" - I've never had poached oysters, but now I'll be chasing this taste for years to come. I think I could have been happy with 15 or 20 of these guys for dinner, but 4 was delicious. We also really enjoyed the lobster and my wife's pigeon which wasn't nearly as gamey as they suggested - it tasted to me like a leaner duck maybe. It was delicious.  We also each enjoyed the somm's wine pairing for our meal. The amount of wine was perfect, and major cheers to the somm who made the pairings because they were just about perfect. Personally, I'd prefer a bottle of very high quality sake over white wine with seafood, but their choices were wonderful. I loved every glass.  I cannot recommend Picasso's highly enough. If you're staying on the strip in Vegas and you can afford it, you should certainly check it out.  In the end, in September 2017, our meal was just over $520 with tip. That's for two of the price fixe menus, a $30 lobster supplement (totally worth it), and two wine pairings (not the deluxe pairings, which are just there for bigger whales).",

I ordered from the Degustation menu that has 5 courses and costs $128. It started off with a very refreshing lobster salad and then followed by a large diver scallop. The scallop was cooked to perfection, very tender and not over cooked. Since we don't eat foie gras (concerned about animal welfare), we picked an alternative oyster dish. The oysters were also cooked to perfection with the right amount of mild creamy sauces, and they were hands down the best oysters I had ever had in my life. There was also a very good selection of dessert. I chose the chocolate hazelnut cake. It was a very generous portion with the most beautiful display.   As for the service, it was the best that you will expect. The staff were super attentive but they also respected your privacy.   Since the restaurant is very close to the Bellagio fountain, it will be a good idea to come at night and be seated next to the window to enjoy the fountain with the dinner.",

Great pre-fixe and wine pairing my last trip out. The service is always top notch, expedient, and friendly. I always leave feeling super full but satisfied. This last visit was the first time I've ordered deer at a restaurant (I've eaten plenty of deer and venison-related products before, but it's always been a little gamey). This one tasted like beef and was tender and flavorful. Enjoyed everything; from the squash soup to the honey wheat bread, and of course, the muffins the next morning (they give you a nice parting gift before you leave). I also had no clue (but in hindsight...duh) the works of art on the wall were actual Picassos! I was told the portfolio in the restaurant is worth at least $200M. Very impressive. I had eaten outside the last time (the view of the fountains is awesome), so didn't look around before. This time, I was inside (was able to snag a table on a Monday night while I was in town for work) and got a chance to admire the paintings. I'm a big fan of this establishment, and will always try to make my way here whenever I'm in Sin City. At least I can always guarantee a win there.",

The location with a view of the Bellagio fountains was perfect, the ambience was nice and romantic but where it fell short was the food. My date and I ordered one of each of the tasting menus, there were many courses and a lot of food but when the standout of all that food was the amuse bouche...well, that just doesn't bode well. Presentation was on point but the flavor just wasn't there. We ultimately skipped out on waiting for dessert and left early. They give you a nice parting gift, though...boxes with small pastries inside. Maybe it was just me or I was having an off night but it just didn't live up to my expectations.",

    "text": "Having had very good experiences at other fine dining establishments in Las Vegas, my wife and I had high expectations of dining at the Picasso to celebrate our anniversary.  We were in relatively formal dress and arrived early for our reservation, even before the doors opened, in order to get a pleasant table for dinner.  Unfortunately, once the restaurant opened its doors the hosts did not pay attention to the line outside and the large group simply rushed in to get seated.  Not wanting to be rude, we waited our turn even though we had been the first in line.  Eventually one of the hosts took us in and we politely asked for a quiet table by a window.  While there were quite a few such tables available, the host refused to seat us at one of them without a clear explanation and shuffled us off to long row of internal tables which were right next to each other thus neither quiet nor by a window.  Unable to comprehend such poor and unprofessional treatment from such a high end establishment, we politely declined and left, the whole episode leaving a very bad taste in our mouths.",

Polite, helpful, not too intrusive - The space very nice.  It's not too dark, well spaced, and the art is beautiful.  It's not too loud and because it is well spaced, you don't need to worry about others being part of your conversation  I had the four course pre fixe: - First, they were totally on board with my celiac disease restrictions.  They said they would make anything (aside from a couple of desserts) gluten free.  So no restrictions on what I could or could not get on the menu! - The amuse-bouche was refreshing and I usually don't like cold soups - The pork belly and pea soup was smooth, tangy, and the pork belly added a nice pop - The ruby shrimp was ok.  I probably should have chosen the foie gras - The veal chop was tender, juicy, and savory and the horseradish was very nice every third bite or so - The flourless chocolate lava cake was delightful.  Rich and not too heavy  Although I'm not a huge fan of walking through the Bellagio, I'll do it to come back to Picasso.",

Fortunately my friend knew one of the sommelier's & he brought an incredible selection of wines and recommended some things to order on the menu.  The Food is amazing!

Picasso was superb and exquisite.  To celebrate my baby sister's special weekend with all five of my sisters, I wanted nothing short of perfection.  This is their first time dinning here.  Originally, my first choice was Joel Robuchon as I had such an amazing experience there, but I couldn't get in.  I made reservation here back in September 2014 as a back up.  Glad I did!  Make your reservation early(period)! We were lucky to have had a table overseeing Bellagio fountains and surrounded with Picasso's artwork.  The ambience was elegant, intimate and fantastic.   Michelin starred food commanding a view of the fountains and Vegas, it was truly indescribable.  We all had the prix fixe menu and it was excellent.  My first course: poached oysters with caviar was out of this world!  I had to remind myself to come up for air as I couldn't stop myself from devouring them within seconds.  The 2nd course: Fois Gras de Touchon, high quality smooth  fois gras served over toast and huckleberry reduction; I love this dish, it's quite rich and buttery, as if you are eating pure steak fat dipped in European butter!  The main course was the braised wagyu short rib, it literally melted in my mouth the minute it touches my tongue.  Then the desserts, my god!  I had the Chocolate Torte, I am not a sweet person, but it was so decadent and nicely presented.  I couldn't resist taking more than one bites.  The service was top notch; our servers and sommelier were awesome!  When we left, they handed us a nice orange box with little muffins.  It was one of the best meals we all have had.  What an awesome experience and couldn't be happier I chose Picasso for an amazing evening with my sisters.",

Picasso paintings are seen throughout the restaurant which makes this place even more unique.   The food is great and the service is even better. We opted for the pre fix menu and wine pairing. Every time a new pairing is brought out the sommelier takes time to explain the wine in great detail. Found him to be very pleasant and funny - definitely not scripted. The food was amazing. My favorite course was the lamb but my girlfriend loved the foie gras.   Our waiter was great and was more than happy to take our picture at the end of our meal. Kind of disappointed we didn't get to sit on the outside where you have a view of the Bellagio fountains but there was a private event going on that evening.   It is an expensive restaurant but not anything that you wouldn't spend at another fine dining restaurant. The price is definitely worth the experience.",

It was honestly one of my best dining experiences I had anywhere in the world. If I had to pick highlights, the Sauteed Steak of Foie Gras and Roasted Tournedo Loin of Lamb were the stars. The foie gras was fantastically prepared with a crisp outside and buttery smooth center, perfectly matched with the rhubarb vanilla jam. When our server brought my lamb I jokingly said, \"I don't know how you're going to top the foie gras.\" Well, leave it up to them to do just that. The lamb was unbelievable! Tender, flavourful, perfectly prepared. It was the best I had ever eaten. The portions for all the courses were just right and we left feeling very satisfied.  The service was truly excellent! The sommelier suggested a great bottle of wine that went very well with our menu. We never once had to ask for anything from anyone. All of our needs were well-anticipated by the staff.  It truly was a perfect dining experience! For me, this place is definitely THE place to visit on future trips to Sin City. I can't wait to return!",

This trip, we chose Picasso and absolutely loved it despite the little hiccup in the beginning.  I've been to many fine dining restaurants as my frequent work trips to Europe with luxury hotels has my standards very high and I often am hard to please with these type of establishments. Picasso did not disappoint. From the moment we walked in, we were welcome by the hostess and seated quickly. Regarding that little hiccup mentioned - unfortunately, we were initially seated in the back corner by the service table, which we weren't pleased about. About asking for a different table, the staff quickly seated us in a much better location, which eased our experience a bit but left a bit of a sour impression.   All of that sour impression was turned around by our amazing waiter, Blake. He was not only knowledgeable, but he was very personable and funny. He made the entire experience 1000x better as he made us laugh and made the service so seamless. The staff was also on top of keeping our drinks full and offering us bread once our plates were empty.  The food was divine. As all has mentioned, the poached oysters were amazing. Salmon was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior, while the deer was exquisite. We also ordered wine pairings and it was perfectly paired with each course.   The Citrus Bombe was my favorite course and I had paired with a cappuccino. I am a cappuccino snob as I've had many great cups, but this was cappuccino was quite nice.. Overall, great service and great food. I have to say - service levels expectations are always high in these high end restaurants, but for us, the greatest differentiator to what made this experience great was Blake. He made the entire experience so fun and memorable.   We will be coming back again.",

The langoustine salad, foie gras and seared scallop were our favorites.  If you go pre-theater, leave enough wiggle room.  When we first arrived, we explained we had a show and needed to get out in enough time to make the show.  We were told no sweat, with some condescension that they do this all the time -- get you to your show.    But they didn't.  We certainly were among the very few early diners...and then somehow they had to rush the main entree and dessert.  My Alaskan halibut was dry and overcooked.   We were not happy, but what could we do?  We had no choice but to rush so we could make our show.  It was not worth complaining about my tasteless overcooked fish because I couldn't eat another one if I wanted to make my show.  Plus dessert was coming out.  Pistachio and fig.   And at the prices Picasso charges, that's a damn shame.",

Also ordered a screw driver and was surprised when they bring you a cup of vodka and a seperate container for juice.   Main courses we all had were solid. I personally feel you cant go wrong with any of the choices just choose what you enjoy.  I had the citrus desert and was happy with it. Will be coming back on my next trip out!",

We had a fixed 5 course meal which included lobster salad, fried scallops, foie gras, lamb and a chocolate brownie dessert.  The lobster salad was quite good but nothing special. The scallops were a bit overcooked, but still nice. The foie gras was amazing. The lamb was perfect. The dessert was a disappointment (like something you can whip up at home in about 10min.)  Overall the meal was really solid, but this is no michelin star restaurant (maybe at one time it was?)  One really neat thing about the venue is that there are real Picasso paintings on the walls.",

    "text": "There's a lot to like about this place, but it has some flaws. The short of it is that we are glad we went, but I would not go back. There was one vegetarian option, and the 'entree' for that and another dish were simply not yummy. That is usually OK for me, because no one ever treats vegetarians well at fine dining. I go with my carnivore partner who likes fine dining on special occasions. I usually have a snack before dinner because sometimes there is so little vegetarian yummyness, and bread gets boring. This place was no exception, except it had the audacity to charge quite a bit more for a not-so-good vegetarian meal. The yummyest thing I had was the one fava bean in my little bowl of soup. I am not belittling that bean, it was scrumptious, I still remember it. But when the highlight of your $150 meal is one fava bean, well... My friend who had pheasant, tuna, lamb, and many other delectables LOVED everything.   The other issue was that every dessert was alcohol based. I feel in this day and age with some many cultures who don't drink alcohol and so many people in alcoholic recovery, that seemed a bit shallow. I did like my dessert even though it had rum, but not every one could order off the desert menu and everything having alcohol made it obvious why. With friends, probably no big deal, but with a business or other groups it may be. It would have been very simple to have a non-alcohol desert that someone could order without having to bring attention to the fact that alcohol was an issue.  The ambiance was great, a little dark, but great, Our servers were also great, I have to say as good as any other place I have ever been. But I won't be back.",

It was Saturday night and we went for Menu Degustation, with lamb choice for me and halibut for my wife. First, we waited for almost 20 minutes until our server came to explain the menu, and he didn't even mention there was another choice for the main course which wasn't on the menu- the duck, which we heard about from the neighbor table after we already ordered. After the first two courses we waited for at least 30 mins for the next one, and it came only after we explicitly asked about. The lamb and halibut were the biggest disappointments on the menu - both were just OK. My wife doesn't eat gluten/dairy, so they didn't have any desert options for her on the menu and the best they came up with was a bowl of berries. And they forgot to bring silverware for the desert, so we had to ask again for that.  I expected so much more from this place but it wasn't the case, there're certainly better options on the strip.",

    "text": "The best fine dining experience I have had in Vegas on the Strip. Come hungry! I made reservations for the BF's birthday and requested to be seated near the window to watch Bellagio's water show. We were right next to it and saw it every 15 minutes for like 2.5 hours!   It's a beautiful restaurant with amazing decor. Everything was so pretty! It has a very romantic and upscale vibe, so make sure you come nicely dressed. The BF had the degustation menu and I had the prix fixe menu. Both were REALLY good. I'd recommend getting one of each so you can sample the most variety of food they have. (BTW they had a special five-course menu with truffles that was $300... that I will come back to try when I win big!). My favorites were the poached oyster, the Maine lobster salad, and the Tai snapper (which unfortunately had a fish bone in it). I don't like foie gras but the BF loved his. He also upgraded one of his entrees to a Wagyu beef (+$40) that he said was well worth it.  Dessert was as good as the rest. I had a grape panna cotta and he had a slice of key lime pie with peanut butter ice cream. They went out of their way to make his dessert extra special for his birthday, and also presented a platter of petit fours (that we enjoyed the next day). On the way out they also give you some cookies (wrapped in a fabulous box!) to take home.   Overall it was a memorable experience. I'm giving a 5 stars even though there was a fish bone (the BF said he would have to give it a 4 because of that). That's how much I liked it. Service was a little slower but understandable because it was a full house. It is a pricey dinner (ours, without drinks, was around ~$350) but I think it's worth it. Put it this way, I'd rather eat home for a couple (and a couple more!) meals and save up the $ to come here once.",

The service was impeccable and the restaurant itself is beautiful, with a terrific front row seat of the Bellagio fountains.

Nothing was particularly memorable and I was just hoping for something more special food-wise  The service was great though.  Extremely attentive service and they give you little goody boxes at the end.  It'll definitely impress that special someone if you take them here.  Beautiful venue and great dining experience.

I was there with my partner and celebrating 7 years of being together made it all more special at this place. The service from beggining to end was spotless.   The ambience is perfect, the real Picassos around you set the scene. You are in a museum, you are in a restaurant, food is art. Which brings us to Jose Serrano's Truffle Menu with Wine Pairing. It is really hard to describe all the flavours i discovered that night. Each bite was exquisite, from the Egg Polle, through the risotto, ravioli butternut squash and filet mignon, the truffles are always present. If you live to go somewhere do not miss Picasso one of my most exhilarating gastronomical experiences.",

    "text": "Venetian, five girls, one room, one shower=no reservation for dinner and a very, very hungry Lia.   After arriving late to our already last minute reservation Picasso was kind enough to still seat us and we ended up dining next to several authentic Picassos in a place overflowing with elegance. Being the grandma that I am I was terribly happy to be sitting next to a 90 year old couple and a group of women in their 70s all dressed up for a night out (so cute!!) The impeccable service at Picasso was worth every penny of the $150 share of my bill. Be forewarned, it is of course a prix-fix menu of either $113 for something like 3 courses or $150 for 5 (i forget). They were even courteous enough to offer some of my friends $50 entrees instead since we weren't told about the prix-fix menu.   We began with a creme of carrot and ginger soup which was immensely refreshing and compliments of the chef. I continued with the warm quail salad with sauteed artichokes and pinenuts. I've also heard their ragout of seasonal vegetables with fresh foie gras and jus de poularde is incredible so if your a fan of foie gras, part of me feels like this is where it might be just as good as paris. I then continued with the venison on a bed of risotto rice which is not game-y at all and very delightful. Surprisingly I forget what I had for dessert but I know it was delicious. I think it was a chocolate souffle. They also brought out a tray of chocolate treats for the table.   I'm very big on the small details and Picasso was attentive to every one of them. They weren't rude at all when we took too much time ordering, were the last people to stay until closing, or when our inappropriate comments were heard over the quiet chatter of the dining room.   If you're planning on venturing here make sure you come to spend a lot of money, definitely get the wine the sommelier recommends, (he was incredible), and grab a seat on the patio if its warm or by the window to see the bellagio watershow if its chilly.   Bon Apetit!",

Dinner for two was about as much as some people pay for rent, but this is luxury. You're treated like a king-- service is great but never intrusive. I felt like my date and I were alone in the restaurant!   Appetizer: Tiny shot of cream of carrot soup, smoked salmon on fried wonton with creme fraiche and caviar. Tasty!  Course 1: Maine lobster salad. Not really what I would consider a salad-- more like a handful of lobster with some watercress on top. Delicious!  Course 2: Scallop on top of tiny asparagus with Hollandaise sauce. DELICIOUS.  Course 3: Foie Gras. From what I could tell, cooked very well-- but very filling.  Course 4: Japanese Kobe beef filet with vegetable ragout. Your filet mignon at Outback hasn't had haiku read to it!  Dessert: Apple cinnamon beignets. Disturbingly larger than most of the other courses. I think this is just to make sure you're full. Bonus: little plate of petit fours.",

    "text": "It's 2 am and I'm still hungry.....I should have ordered a bowl of noodles, like my bf did after our dinner at Picasso.  I've been to a couple of two- and three-star Michelin restaurants, and this restaurant doesn't have the \"wow\" factor that I expected -- so I was kind of disappointed.  First off, service was pretty good, they gave us great seats so we could watch the Bellagio fountain show (definitely make reservations in advance, it pays off.)  But our wine needed some air, and rather than decant, the sommelier just told us to wait 10 minutes before drinking it. That was kind of weird because after we'd pour every glass, we'd stare at it for 10 minutes waiting for the acidity to disappear -- kinda sucked considering it was one of the more expensive bottles of wine.  On to the food.  Our appetizers were great 1) fresh and light maine lobster salad 2) seared scallops with a sauce I licked off the plate 3) seared foie gras (served with rhubarb, which was too crunchy for my taste and I didn't eat.)  The real disappointment was the main course. Here we were, building up to the main course, and we had lamb which was perfectly cooked but had no wow factor to it.  Just well-prepared lamb.  Sauce wasn't amazing, sides were just meh.  Dessert was also just meh too.  As far as Michelin goes, this place is NOT aspiring to be a 3-star Michelin. They don't serve your plates at the same time, they don't bring a champagne cart out, and they served us when one person was in the bathroom. Good service, but no different from other non-rated Michelin restaurants.  Coursese are small!  As stated below, after dinner my bf went to Venetian to have some noodles.  And now I'm sitting here at 2 am hungry.",

In fact, even though the place looks like it's going to be stuffy, it's actually very warm, inviting and impressive. Upon entering the restaurant there is a massive original Picasso to gaze at, while your table is set up. The whole restaurant has a dozen or more Picasso originals to boast of. I was impressed.  We had the pleasure of sitting at the best table in the joint, right on the water-where we were watching a fountain show every twenty minutes. I seriously felt like a princess (the whole staff knew it was my birthday), and was served as one. Our waiter (Michael, I think?) was awesome. He joked around but was very professional and even offered to take a photo with us when the fountain show came up, I think he ran outside as it statred up once to make sure he captured us with it. Really cool guy, we like him.  Ok, now on to the food: O. M. G.  BEST foie gras I ever tasted (seared)!! Myself and a girlfriend went for the prix fix menu (had more choices) and another friend did the degustation menu (only 2 choices for main course). I'm happy we did it this way because we basically got to taste almost everything offered on the menu this way. The meat was perfect for all three of us, the poached lemon oysters with caviar (TO DIE FOR), and the courses were served by an entourage, I'm into that ;) I remember every course for all three of us, and honestly-that means a lot coming form me, I wish the lobster salad would have been on the prix fix menu, SO GOOD.  For dessert, they dressed up my cherry palette with a Happy Birthday and a candle, I think I had a permanent smile fixed on my face through the whole meal.   The overall experience was definitely 5+ stars. The staff, the food, the ambiance was clearly well thought out, and it shows. You definitely have to pay for it ($600 for three) but if you can afford it, everyone needs to try this place one time in their life when visiting Vegas.   Thank you to Chef Serrano/staff at Picasso, for making my 29th birthday truly memorable. :)",

The restaurant is cozy and classy, with 14 (at least I think that was what the waiter said) Picasso originals hanging on the walls, and the Bellagio fountains right outside.  The night before we had eaten at MIX--the difference between these two restaurants cannot be understated.  Everything about our experience at Picasso was better than MIX.  The service, in particular, was attentive, courteous, friendly and professional.  We felt welcomed and waited on--whereas at MIX our waiter abandoned us for long stretches (along with other issues).  The food at Picasso was delicious--I think every plate from every course left the table clean.

After being seated we were welcomed with a delightful dish as we welcome from the chef, which was a potato soup with thinly sliced almonds and a side of quail's egg and cheese. My only disappointment fell in that the portion for the soup was not larger. It was pefection.  I was amazed at how impeccable their service is, which I'm sure is to be expected when you are paying for a high dollar meal but they were Truely friendly and very welcoming considering how young myself and my friends dining with us are. We found ourselves feeling slightly out of place considering the clientele is not typically around our age, but the waiters and staff made sure that was no matter.   On a side notation the views you have of the water show outside are stunning and the dessert which I ordered the Pineapple dish was exquisite.

Overwhelming! On the up-side, it was very delicious, as I was reminded over and over by my dining-mates.  More than anything, I would describe most of it as decadent, which is my word for \"fatty and subsumed by butter\".  The breads and accompanying dips served as appetizers were all very interesting, and I remember one being ten times the bread of its brothers, so that we were all constantly digging through the bread pile to find more of its kind.  I would say, take someone here to impress them - someone you don't necessarily like, so that you will have the convenience of regular interruptions off the starboard bow [courtesy of the Bellagio fountains]. Later, tell them that foie gras is made by stuffing a tube down a duck's esophagus several times a day and dumping pounds of grain down there until their liver is the size of your plate. Wowza!",

After examining the menu for Guy Savvoy, Picasso's pre fix stood out more.... Their bread and petite fours aren't as good as Joel Robuchon in terms of taste and varieties, but other than that... I love their food!!  Definitly one of my favorite restaurant in Vegas!!!    I love their seared Foie Gras and tourchon...!!!  YUM!!!",

    "text": "It's been about two month since I went to Picasso (and one day since I started taking Yelp seriously) so this review simply will not do Picasso justice.  Quite simply, Picasso was the best dinner EVER.  Words cannot describe how amazing this dining experience was.  Everything was nearly flawless.  The waiters were knowledgeable and always ready to help and did not display any hint of pretentiousness.  The decor was very classy and well-done (then again if you hung a bunch of Picasso paintings inside a burger joint, it probably wouldn't look too bad either).  The waterfront view was beautiful as well. And the food...oh the food...  Since I don't have the menu on me (and I'm pretty sure they change it regularly anyways), I'm going strictly by my warm and fuzzy memories.  Bear with me here.    There were three prix fix choices that evening.  I was tempted to go with the black truffle option, but the beatdown the Venetian was giving me that weekend sealed my fate.  I would be going with the more inexpensive option:   First, came the lobster salad.  It was, as you would expect, visually appealing and quite fresh and delicious.  A good start to the night.  Next came the scallop.  This was the best scallop I have ever had.  It was so simple.  It was a piece of perfectly seared scallop on a bed of potato sauce(think a lighter version of mashed potatoes) and I believe a reduction sauce.   As far as texture was concerned, there was no resistance as you sunk your teeth in the scallop, just pure tender goodness.    I would also like to point out as the dinner went along, we continued to gorge on the delicious bread they kept serving us.  First, I fell in love with the olive bread.  However, my friend insisted that I should try the french bread.  Sure enough, the french bread was even better!  It was so soft and buttery that we acted like little kids that had just discovered the wonders of butter.  Onto the foie gras: It was, as expected, rich, flavorful, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The sauce in conjunction with foie gras was okay.  There really isn't much to say.   Finally, we get to the aged lamb.  I didn't know what to expect.  Every course seemed to improve on the next.  Would the buck stop there? As the dish arrived, we saw an impressive, tall piece of lamb.  Upon first bite, my fears were assuaged.  The flavor was perfect (I seem to be using this word a lot) and the meat so unbelievably tender.  On the side, there was a piece of artichoke that went very well with the meat.  Seriously, it could not be any better.  The night ended with dessert, a chocolate fondant cake.  It was very rich (chocolate lovers would love it) and a good way to end a memorable night.   I have not been doing fine dining for very long, but this was far and away my favorite experience and I would definitely go to Picasso again, and I highly recommend that you do too.",

If the weather permits, there is a terrace outside to view the water show. If you are going here, TRY TO GET A TABLE AT A WINDOW WITH A VIEW OF THE LAKE.  We weren't so lucky, and it was still an amazing experience, but it would have made it that much better. The food was amazing.  I still dream about it, even after experiencing Alex and Bar Charlie. Do yourself a favour, a suck up the $120 extra charge for the kobe beef steak.  You will not regret it. I was with my girlfriend, and she couldn't finish each of the dishes so I got to sample everything on the menu (I had the tasting menu, she the prix fixe).  Everything was incredible.

The artwork was fantastic, our waiter was incredibly attentive and the food was amazing. I enjoyed course after course. The red pepper soup was great. The little gift boxes with cookies was a wonderful touch.   I really enjoyed being surrounded by real Picasso paintings during our meal.  I also loved watching the Bellagio fountains out the windows.   The only negative would be the price but I was aware of the prices before I went so I was not surprised when the bill came. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to any foodie who is looking for \"an adventure in eating\" while they are in Vegas.",

The original Picasso's lining the wall added a special flair to the place.   The service was harried yet slow (if that makes sense). It seemed as if the wait staff was trying to interact with us as quickly as possible. It was if they were saying, \"We've done this before and the food is really outstanding so I don't really have to take my time to make you feel welcome\". They were relatively cold and impersonal. Our waiter did warm up later but by then we didn't have any interest in talking to him. They were VERY slow in getting the food out. I know this is a french restaurant but even the french can read body language and ours said \"We don't want a two and a half hour meal\". Didn't work!  So where do the five stars come in, you ask. It's the food! It was sublime. I would suffer two and a half hours of a humorless, rushed environmet to enjoy this food. Everything was exceedingly flavorful. I tried things I wouldn't normally try (poached oysters) and it was all absolutely fabulous.  A few head scratchers, though. the bathroom was not spotless (at $140 a plate, you better have your bathroom spotless). I could have sworn the were playing The Backstreet boys in the restroom???  Overlooking the Bellagio water fountain show while we ate was a special treat.   The food trumps every negative. Smiley face and a star for the food only.",

    "text": "Simply extraordinary. I could use more flowery language but why bother? Picasso speaks for itself, on every level ranging from service, to food, to ambience, even the bathrooms.   Our solitary issue was that despite making reservations 3 months in advance, having Mlife Gold status, and specifying that it was a special occasion for my girlfriend and I, we were unable to be accommodated on the patio overlooking the Fountains, which was admittedly a factor is choosing Picasso. That said, such was the food and service that I have no issue giving the restaurant 5 stars anyway.  The prix fixe options were more to our liking, so we opted for that with the standard wine pairing. I have no idea what the premium wine pairing would have tasted like, but I'm now curious as even the standard pairing was mind blowing. The quail salad, like every dish we ate, was a work of art in presentation and in taste. I had the poached oysters, and my God, I could have done 4 courses of this alone. The caviar was perfectly complementary, not overpowering at all against the delicate taste of the oysters, and the wine served with it refreshing and crisp. Next dish was the foie gras and ruby red shrimp. Again, there are no words. I find myself with a lack of adjectives to adequately describe how good something as simple as shrimp tasted. My only regret was that before I knew it they were gone (3 shrimp to a course).   The main dishes were equally spectacular. My deer medallions were tender and not gamey at all, and the caramelized apple was a welcome addition. My girlfriend's wagyu short rib was melt in your mouth, eyes rolling back in your head delicious.   The only part of dessert that was even slightly( and I do mean slightly) underwhelming was dessert. The pineapple upside down cake was just a touch to the dry side, but nothing worth complaining about. I honestly found it helped settle the stomach after the incredibly rich meal.  Service was also off the charts. Our table was headed by Robert, who was both knowledgeable, funny, and attentive, all while not giving the impression of hovering. Truly world class service from a world class restaurant. He went so far as to escort my girlfriend and I to the patio for photos after I told him our original request couldn't be accommodated.   For the cherry on top, as many have mentioned, it's hard not to be wowed when you're surrounded by $100 million worth of original Picassos.  No one will tell you Picasso is cheap. But everyone should tell you it's worth it.",

My first french haute cuisine in Vegas was at Joel Robuchon at MGM, my second here at Picasso and my third at Guy Savoy at Caesar's. Picasso was not up to tier compared to these other two $$$$ restaurants in terms of creativity, service and decor. If you have one fancy place to pick when you're in Vegas, I don't think this should be your choice, and here's why.   The fact that it was in Bellagio probably made you think it must be the best haute French restaurant in town, might not be True. They had a prix fixe menu when we went there and for my main course I upgraded my dish for a lot of extra money for their Wagyu just to try how it was. Not worth the money. My other two friends were a bit underwhelmed too. Honestly I couldn't even remember exactly what we ate.   The dining room was quite dimly lit and maybe that's why we couldn't see well what we were eating lol. The decor was OK, nothing so special that would add to your dining experience. What's nice was the balcony by the famous fountain. It's great for taking photos!  The service was alright, not bad but nowhere close to exceptional. A few times we had to look around for attention, a big no no for a high-end restaurant.   I would have not a single doubt going back to the other two restaurants but definitely not Picasso.",

There will be nothing to complain but the server. For the whole dining time, his job was really basic like taking the order and that was pretty much it! Every time he came to our table was so quick and nothing special. He was way worst then the food runners and the bussers  We were just ok with the server. However, what made us so unsatisfied was when we were about to leave the restaurant, we were pretty sure that the server saw just standing up. Meanwhile he was already at the door but he just opened the door for himself and walked away without holding the door or greeting us.   We were so mad that we had to ask the host the name of our server and his name happened to be Jorge I think.  With other casual restaurant, I wouldn't expect anything much. However, this is a fine dining, 2-star Michelin restaurant. I spent time and money to have the experience at a fine dining restaurant and his work performance was worse than a basic server in a normal restaurant I had in Chinatown.

The priceless Picasso's adorning the walls, and the stunning ring-side view of the fountains at Bellagio set the stage for an infinitely memorable evening.  Food: The oysters were poached to perfection and the tuna tartare was wonderfully seasoned. However, we were surprisingly underwhelmed by some courses - the foie gras was a tad too greasy (no pun intended) and the deer left something to be desired as far as flavour. Dessert was delightful. Thumbs up to the petits fours and the elegantly packed muffins!  Service: We were exceedingly grateful that our request for a patio table was honoured. While the maitre d' and other staff were incredibly amenable, attentiveness was wanting in some domains, particularly for an establishment of this calibre with two Michelin stars e.g. long-drawn lag before glasses were refilled. Perhaps outdoor seating and the lighting after dusk were contributory factors, but then again, we arrived well before sunset. Something tells me that the outcome of the fabled cutlery-under-the-chair test would not sit well with Michelin inspectors at the time that we visited.  Summary: It was a dream to spend 3+ hours dining with a view - we wound up bagging at least 7 fountain shows. Picasso offers a superb dining experience amid exceptional surroundings, and that in itself lends ample reason to visit (or return).   Tip: Request a table on the patio - the Picasso's would only be a few steps away.",

Tables adequately spaced for privacy and romance. Service very attentive without being intrusive. I had the degustation with the upgrades of Iberico and wagyu filet. everything was perfect. Expensive and a special occasion place but utterly perfect in every way. I was at Gary Danko in San Francisco recently and felt like I was sitting @ my neighbors table. No such issues here. This place is truly one of the very best. Ranks with French Laundry, Per Se, the original Gordon Ramsey etc. No buyers remorse here, just great memories.",

That's just the way it is.  $27 for a glass is not all that steep of a price for a good wine in a good restaurant... but kind of a stingy pour.  (The $63 wine pairing I had with the Prix fixe dinner was great, though... interesting, good-tasting wines and nice pours for the pairings.)  There were a couple of other super small issues... not worth going into because this place is great.  Nice ambience without being too stuffy.  Every bite was great.  Had poached oysters with caviar, foie gras (pate style), fallow deer (yes, I felt bad) and some dessert.    I don't know anything about wine (and have suspicions about the whole racket) so it was nice to get some wines that I would never have known about and would never have known to pair with these bites.",

    "text": "*** My goodness 1000th Yelp review after 5 long years ***   Instead of writing a Yelp review about Yelp itself (some Yelpers do it to signify the cornerstone of their Yelp achievements), I think it is more interesting to write about this amazing Michelin Two Stars (2008 & 2009) and AAA Five-Diamond Award (1998 ~ 2015) traditional French fine-dining restaurant in Las Vegas. Not only did this $128 (not including tax and tip) meal brought out my raw emotion, all seafood dishes at Picasso were some of the best seafood (specifically Maine lobster, scallop, and black bass) that I've ever tasted.  Originally I made my 6:30 PM reservation through the Opentable, but I actually arrived 10 minutes before my reservation time because I simply did not want to miss out this opportunity of a lifetime. Even though I visited the Bellagio for multiple times (*cough* craps tables *cough*), it took me a while to pinpoint the exact location.  Direction (From Caesars Palace or Bally's): Walk across the pedestrian bridge and find the Louis Vuitton shop first. From there, just keep walking towards the Bellagio's casino floor until you see the Chanel shop (you need to turn back if you accidentally step into the casino floor). Now look around and you should see the escalator. Take the escalator and make an immediate left turn once you reach the basement level.  Menu (two options): The prix fixe menu is a $118 (no tax and tip; additional $58 for a sommelier's wine pairing) take-your-pick 4-course menu. The menu degustation is a $128 (no tax and tip; additional $68 for a sommelier's wine pairing) mostly fixed 5-course menu (you can only pick one of the three entrees for the 4th course as well as couple dessert options).  Dining atmosphere: You can see the majestic Fountains of Bellagio (30-minute per show before 8 PM and 15-minute per show after 8 PM), but you can't really hear the music because windows are pretty much soundproof. And don't forget that you will be surrounded by $100+ million worth of Picasso's artworks. Good service (I expected no less from a Michelin Two Stars restaurant), but I didn't have too much of a small talk with my waiter.  *** Menu Degustation, 5-Course Dinner ***  [Amuse Bouche] Creamy soup and croquette: Who doesn't like melt-in-your-mouth croquette? Croquette was just as good, if not better, than Porto's croquette.  Breads: Three options were available - cheese, onion, and French baguette. Nothing to write about.  [1st Course] Maine Lobster Salad (Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette): The combination among melon, tomato, and natural sweetness from the Maine lobster were truly amazing. Even after two long months, I can still picture the umami taste from this salad. (5/5)  [2nd Course] Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop (Potato Maousseline and Jus de Veau): I never had a scallop like this - slightly charred scallop bursting with flavors. This mashed potato was sooooo silky smooth. (5/5)  [3rd Course] Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras (Crab Apple Sous Vide with Ground Cinnamon, Clove, Nutmeg, Foie Gras Almond-Pistachio Crumble): At first foie gras tasted fatty with melt-in-your mouth texture, then out of nowhere the unknown floodgate suddenly opened and this unique foie gras meaty flavor just overwhelmed my taste buds. Pistachio crumble gave a good finishing touch. (4.75/5)  [4th Course] Sauteed Filet of Black Bass (Court-Bouillon Sauce and Fresh Herbs): Again another melt-in-your-mouth dish, but by this point I started to feel a bit overwhelmed because the previous dish (foie gras) was a REALLY heavy dish (it is the feeling you get from eating too much fatty food). (5/5)  [5th Course] Sauterne Poached Pear (Almond Frangipane, Blood Orange Butter Pear Sauce, French Butter Pear Sorbet): Loved the crunchiness from frangipane, but it was definitely the least memorable dish. (3.5/5)  Assortment of sweet bites (a chocolate truffle, a mint meringue, a berry pate de fruit, etc.): Other than that one sweet bite I can't remember, all other four were alright. (2/5)  Banana muffins (inside of a souvenir box): I was given two banana muffins just right before I left ... sadly I didn't get to try any of them because I left my box at the Zumanity show. Nooooooo!  ***  I finished the entire 5-course dinner in 120 ~ 135 minutes and I didn't even do the wine pairing. So if you are planning to watch a show right after the dinner, then give yourself at least 3 hours just for this dinner.  In terms of the dining experience with additional surprising elements, I still think Alinea in Chicago is the place to go for that unique experience. Now if you are looking for an amazing high-end FOOD experience (minus the dessert), then Picasso is a better choice than Alinea in that aspect. Picasso delivered a truly Michelin Two Stars worthy food and I would definitely recommend Picasso over Spago (a Michelin Two Stars restaurant in Los Angeles).",

    "text": "If I could give a restaurant six stars this would be a six star review. I have dined at Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, at Robert Curry's Auberge du Soleil in Napa, and Thomas Keller's Per Se in New York City.  Our experience at Picasso was better than than all three.  Dining is a synergy of ambiance, cuisine and hospitality--as with all beauty--the sum of her parts.  Like the Picasso's that grace her wall's this restaurant truly has je ne sais quoi.  The hostess was beyond helpful, assisting my bride with her gown.  Their Restaurant Manager David was warm and friendly, like an old friend.  Our waiter was engaged yet professional, and the assistants were all on point.  Now, to the cuisine.  Wow!  Julian Serrano is truly a Master Chef.  I have worked for Kevin Taylor of Denver, Pierre Padovani of Honolulu, and I currently work for Gordon Ramsey.  So, I fully understand the attention to detail that is required at this level, and Picasso has it all.  I love raw oysters, for me it's all about tasting the sea the same way one tastes the terroir with wine.  Typically cooking an oyster will detract from the natural flavor.  Chef Serrano lightly poaches the oyster retaining the natural sea salts yet adding a comforting warmth to it's delicate texture.  Each is finished with a generous dollop of caviar that's literally bursting with flavor.  In the center of the plate is an intricately carved Meyer Lemon.  Again, attention to every detail.  I typically enjoy Prime Beef when I go out.  When I discovered that Picasso is taking the high road--not that safe middle of the road by being, essentially, just another steakhouse--I thought about doing the Sea Bass.  My wife ended up ordering this succulent dish and it was perfectly crisp on the edges with a soft warm flake to the center.   I went with the Sauteed Medallions Of Fallow Deer, Medium Rare.  There was no gamey nature to this red meat what-so-ever.  The flavor and texture could be described the same way one would compare a Cabernet to a Pinot Noir.  I consider it a more nuanced and melodic, less-bold and brash, alternative to prime beef.  It did not feel heavy at all but was filling and very satisfying.  Each medallion was adorned with a delicious cranberry compote and finished table-side with a zinfandel reduction.  I personally would have paired Orin Swift's Mercury Head Cabernet with these but, it being our wedding night, we optioned to not even open the wine list.  That being said our bill, after a glass of wine at the bar (sitting at the feet of an original picasso) was an even $300.  This is an absolute sweetheart deal considering that our meal also included a delightful amuse bouche, a plate of ruby shrimp (in addition to the courses mentioned above), and was finished by two of the most beautiful hand-crafted desserts you could imagine.  Each plate was painted with congratulations, in chocolate, and the finale was a little silver platter of sweets.    As Las Vegas locals, I would rate The Bellagio's Picasso as the #1 restaurant in our city, perhaps in The World.  We were seated right against the window and my wife--who moved here from London with The Royal Ballet 20 years ago and was Celine Dions's Ballet Director for many years--finally saw the Bellagio Fountain explode to \"My Heart Will Go On\" in it's entirety.  It is truly amazing what absolute treasures can exist right in our own backyard.  Thank you for making our Monday Night (Wedding ; ) Date Night so amazing!",

    "text": "After eating at Picasso, I highly recommend eating here! It has such an exquisite location behind the Bellagio fountains. Depending on your seating area, you are able to watch the show as you dine.   When deciding my meal, I went for the prix fixe which consists of three courses of your selection. During our meal we were given about 2-3 courses that were compliments of the chef. Every single dish that was served was amazing. In my opinion, Picasso is Michelin starred for a reason. My favorite part was the dessert, I ordered the Banana French Toast with Ice Cream which was absolutely marvelous. If this is an option for dessert, get it!   The staff was what you would expect from a restaurant that is ranked so highly. They always kept your glass of water full, pushed in your chair, folded your napkin, and was very polite. The waiter we had was very attentive, helped us make decisions with the menu, and explained items we did not recognize.  At the end of the meal, they give you a box with \"Picasso\" written in red letters. Inside the box contains delicious baked goods.   Tip: Make sure you dress nicely. There is a dress code.",

    "text": "Came here on Sunday to celebrate the hubs birthday. I have to say this is the most grown up dinner experience I've had in terms of service, ambiance, and pace.   We had reservations at 5:45pm so had the pick of the litter as far as seating preferences go. We opted to sit out on the veranda (or lanai to HI) for first row experience of the fountains. In the two hours that it took to dine, we watched 4 fountain shows. Which we're just the best as usual. Here's a low down on the rest:  Pros:  Ambiance- it's very romantic and peaceful. If you're not looking to have meaningful conversations with your dinner companions then don't come here. Lol.  Picasso Paintings- The various Picasso paintings around the restaurant were wonderful! They have a binder that you can have which explains the paintings and the history of the artist. Another pro of having early dinner reservations is that we could walk around the restaurant like a museum and view the paintings without bothering anyone.   Service- on point, attentive and accommodating without pretension or pomp. However we did enjoy the showmanship of the wine sommelier. He was passionate about them wines boy!   Cons: Personally, tho the food was really good, I wouldn't have minded a few more options to the menu, but regardless of what you chose, it was all good.",

    "text": "Time-machine dining for all your favorite Americanized-French dishes, preparations and flavors from the early 90's. \"Traditional\" French food supported by a five-star front of house team.   ++ solid 5-star service from our captain and his team. Very well done. A 10-top table is a marathon and a beast! Awesome work!  EXCELLENCE IN SERVICE Sadly, this style of service and elegance is very rare to find in these days of 2017.  Maitre'D and supporting hosts, Sommelier and wine stewards, Captain (and a True one at that), under-waiters, runners, waterers, bread men, busers.  Making out this list I guess it is not too far from staffing in many other places, but so rare to find the *coordination*, the elaborate communication, the attention to detail and timings to the second.  It makes all the difference in the world, although if they're doing it right, you don't even notice: by the end of your meal, you are just sitting gracefully in bliss as the flavors continue to titillate the palate. At Picasso you are also looking out at the Bellagio pool and enjoying the water show.    # I wouldn't be mickobizzle if I didn't find something to improve on: ## runners *always* messed up the plate for our vegetarian diner, always giving him he wrong plate. It was like they were picking on him, mocking him for refusing to rip the flesh of each dish's beast, so blatantly brandished in his face!  WINE LIST OF THE AGES You might expect (and I *do*) a wine list of \"death\" that would crush the cellars of most of the world's restaurants, especially here in Vegas. Picasso doesn't disappoint.  For me tonight we had bottles of: + the tip-top bottle (and so glad to show my colors of favoritism) in Maison Tattainger's finest preparation, the Comtes De Champagne, this one from 2006.  + big bad bold bruisy Heitz Cabernet from 2011.  Yeah I know it's a bit boring and standard, but I know none of these folks have had it, so there.  + a sweet and pure, fresh and creamy, silky Montbazzilac  with our desserts. (Should have ordered it for that monster-sized fois gras)  ART OF THE AGES Well, it is called Picasso so you might imagine that being Bellagio they would have multiple largest-format-he-painted original oils throughout the dining room. Multiple tens of millions. Magnificent.    BUT IVE MOVED ON!! THIS FOOD IS ALSO FROM ANOTHER ERA.  I no longer crave the heart-stopping all-butter-and-cream recipes of those days (early '90's) and certainly not in *every* one of the nine courses! * delightful pheasant croquette amuse bouche filled with cream sauce and accompanied by a side shot glass of savory and creamy cream.  * lobster salad. Wow what a portion! Piles and piles of delicious, luscious, rich lobster meat! (For some that could have been a meal, but we are just getting started!) * scallop with mashed potatoes and a rich meaty (beef stock?!!?) gravy, garnished with truffle shavings (xomg riicchh!) for a $supplement (Dude I'm full.) # saute of fois gras. Not one but *two* ginormous pieces of the world's most decadent meat. Preparation was warm sear on the outside and cold-like-butter inside. Not for me. I like it one way or the other. And I wanted it to be seared to the point of almost melting.  * three giant lamb medallions. Perfectly cooked and drizzled with a delightful lamb aioli. Best sauce of the night. Garnish was a miss. Breaded and fried lettuce, tomato and stewy veg.  * petit fours trays of awesome meringues, apricot gummies, orange cheesecakes, chocolate truffles and fondants. Woaw! * fine coffee!  woaw! * pineapple tart. pink-cotton-candy ice cream, quenelles of raspberry ice cream, vanilla tapioca atop a delicious pineapple layered pastry. Luscious! * digestif of Cointreau, neat.   A fantastic tasting menu if you have never enjoyed this style of food properly (or if you were too young).  A museum of fine art and fine cuisine!",

    "text": "Picasso is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas and one of the best in all my travels throughout the US. First, make your reservation before you go on vacation. Sometimes you can get in on the same day and sometimes they are booked for the week, so just call the Bellagio, where Picasso is located and ask to be connected.  Second, do not go in their dressed like a slob. They will not let you in. Do not wear shorts, and I don't care how wonderful you think they are, do not wear jeans and flip flops. You will look out of place and the fact is if you are going to spend up to $360.00 for 2 people, why would you treat this event like a McDonald's? If you show up looking like you think your are at the buffet, they do have clothes they will lend you, but seriously, this is a great place, treat it as a special occasion. You can have the prix fixe menu, but I would order what you want and be happy with everything. Their fish is the best and the sauces that they use on everything, be it a meat dish or a fish dish are just wonderful. The soups are great, everything is great. We love their shrimp. For a vegetable have the asparagus. Skip the quail salad and try something else, it is not the best. There are other salads that are better. They have a Lava Cake and that may seem old and outdated, but it is wonderful. Have it, you will love it. All the deserts are wonderful. I have not tried them all, I would be dead, but I have had a few and wow, just wow. The service is fantastic and the restaurant is just stunning. You can sit indoors or outside near the Bellagio Fountains that go off every 15 minutes and dance to music. I prefer indoors, it is more quite and intimate. Unless you are just rich, you will not be able to eat at Picasso every day. It is very expensive, so treat it like the special event it is. You will love it. Be prepared to spend about $360 for 2 people. Ya, it is a lot. If that is just too much for you, cut out the alcohol, you don't really need it and skip the salad.  Enjoy.",

    "text": "We were here for my girlfriend's birthday. I made sure the restaurant knew about it when I made the reservation. Food was great (We got Menu Degustation and Prix Fixe), perhaps we were unlucky with the waiter...the ambience was awesome (sat outside where you can see the fountain show every 15 minutes). All was good except 2 things: the waiter and the timing of food, which are crucial to fine dining.  Problem #1 I don't know if it is because our reservation was at 9pm (they close at 9:30), they were trying to rush everything.....the timing of the next dish was way too early. We could see them having our next plates ready at the side while we were still finishing off our plate.....this should never happen in fine dining.  The moment we finished our plate, the next dish served in 2 seconds....maybe this place is not fine dining....not too expensive but not cheap either.  Problem 2: The waiter we had was simply sloppy. I ordered non-sparkling water, he brought sparkling....which is fine as people do make mistakes but when I told him about it, he didn't apologize or anything. He simply said, OK, I will change it. Additionally, they did not explain when they bring each dish to explain what you are about to eat which is fine but not what we expected.  Lastly, they didn't know we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday. I had to go tell the waiter after they served us dessert....which my gf was a bit disappointed. The server said he never got the paper that said it was my gf's bday (They did bring us birthday dessert after I told the waiter). I am not sure what happened but the attitude of the waiter was below professional. All it takes is something like \"we apologize for missing the note, here is a birthday cake from us, I hope you enjoy rest of the day\" but instead he just brought the dessert and that was all. Again, professionalism of the waiter matters in fine dining.  Since dining is not just about the food, I have to give this place 2 stars. Again the food was good and the atmosphere was good so if you don't care about the service/server, this is a place for you. Don't come here expecting a fine dining experience - you can't redo a special celebration so don't risk it here, I hope they can see this post and re-train their staff.",

    "text": "We had a phenomenal meal here!  I rarely do tasting menus because there are quite a few things I don't eat, but the degustation menu here lined up really well with my tastes.  It's 5 courses, plus bread, an amuse and mignardises.  I've had bigger meals that I was able to finish, but the food here is so heavy and rich I was stuffed by course #3.    The degustation menu is:  Amuse bouche - a cup of potato leek soup and pheasant croquette.  Both the soup and the croquette had wonderful flavor and texture.  Great start to the meal.  1st course - Maine lobster salad.  This was one of my least favorite courses, simply because I don't really like mayo.  However I realize mayo is an important part of lobster salad and I think this course was objectively very good.  I loved the apple-champagne vineagrette and cherry tomatoes.  2nd course - Pan seared U-10 scallop over potato mousseline with veal jus.  This was tied with the foie for my favorite course.  Scallop was cooked perfectly.  Potato mousseline was amazing (like mashed potatoes but with a better flavor and thicker texture) and veal jus had great flavor and was the perfect complement to the scallop and potatoes. There was also a delicious crispy potato chip-like thing stuck in the potato mousseline.  3rd course - Sauteed steak of foie gras topped with toasted pistachios and served over dried quince and quince sauce.  This was a really big highlight for me, coming from California where foie is banned.  The foie was smooth and buttery and had a perfect flavor.  The sweet quince was the perfect pairing and the crunchy pistachios provided a nice texture contrast.  The piece of foie was HUGE too.  Definitely the best foie steak I've had and tied only with Jean-Georges' foie gras torchon for the best foie I've ever had.  4th course - Choice of halibut or lamb (or wagyu beef for a huge supplement).  I had the halibut, my husband had the lamb.  This was probably my least favorite of the courses, probably just because I was getting full and it was a less unusual thing.  Still the halibut was cooked well and I loved the creamy sauce on the asparagus (the asparagus themselves were too thick for my liking).  The portion was big and I could only eat about half of it because I knew I had to save some room for dessert.  My husband liked his lamb.  5th course - Dessert. You can choose anything from their dessert menu (about 8 options).  I had the warm chocolate fondant with banana caramel ice cream.   The chocolate cake was excellent, I wasn't as big a fan of the ice cream (I though the combo was weird and I probably would have preferred plain banana or caramel ice cream).   I was also stuffed beyond belief.  I brought half of the cake home and it reheated pretty well the next day.  My husband didn't really like any of the options so he asked for and was given plain vanilla ice cream.  Mignardises - An assortment of about 6 treats, including a dark chocolate ganache candy, a chocolate truffle, a white chocolate truffle, a meringue, a jelly, and a little fruit biscotti.  We had to take these to go.  Farewell gift - A really nice Picasso box with two banana chocolate chip mini-muffins for breakfast the next day, and it was given to both of us, not just me.  Overall,  we got a LOT of food and I really couldn't find fault with any of it.  Some courses blew me away more than others, but nothing was bland or prepared incorrectly.  It was really an A+ meal from start to finish.  I loved the ambiance and decor of the dining room, with real Picassos on the walls (they encourage you to photograph them!) and, even from the inside, a nice view of the Bellagio fountains, which went off about 8 times during our 2 hour meal.  Service was really excellent as well, although I was a little surprised they didn't ask about allergies (we certainly could have brought it up had we wanted to).  Highly, highly recommended for fine dining in Vegas.",

    "text": "Simply amazing fine dining.  It's our second time here so this review is a little overdue.  Mrs. and I went with another couple this time and it was as good as I remembered the first time.    This latest time... we were seated on time next to one of the better paintings IMO so that started things off right.  A very large party was later seated next to us so the noise level was a little higher than usual, but not an issue at all.  We still had a great view of the fountains as well which is another great part of the setting of the room.  The paintings, the fountains, the plates, and the food really set the environment for some serious fine dining grubbing (oxymoron kinda, but I think it's fitting here, hehe).  We all did the degustation menu, 2 of us with lamb and the other 2 with fish.  I did the tasting menu last time and really enjoyed it, this was my wife's 2nd time with the degustation menu and she would basically eat it every day if she could.  1st course lobster salad...  a secret star really.  Nice large chunks of lobster, paired well with some melon balls and a nice light dressing.  I think you might end up forgetting about this dish a little because it really just tastes like lobster, but it's the clean and fresh which helps awaken the pallet for the evening.  2nd course Scallop, seared and seasoned perfectly.  I enjoy me some salt and the scallop was seasoned very nicely which actually paired well with the less aggressive jus, nice balance.  3rd course foie gras with chocolate ganache cherries...  ummm....  spectacular.  Fatty, rich foie with slightly tart cherries and mildly sweet chocolate.  Getting a little cherry and chocolate with the foie on each bite is ridiculous.  It's like those flavors belong together, like they shouldn't be without each other or something.  4th course entree...  fish was a black bass with crispy skin in a saffron broth.  The broccoli on the plate was awesome too, but that fish with the broth and the skin, loved it.  I wish they had a bigger portion.  2nd time my wife ordered the lamb, 2nd time she basically devoured it and almost forgot to give me some, lol.  Not gamy at all, eats like a steak with great lamb flavor, and melts in your mouth.    The dessert is a great way to end the evening, but I think we ordered better last time.  We had the bread pudding and the apples and cinnamon this time.  The bread pudding is a little heavy and not creamy at all, maybe it's just the name that throws me off.  Apples and cinnamon were good and paired with some crepes.  You'll be so full anyways, just want something a little sweet and some coffee to prevent a coma though.  Friends had the chocolate cake (probably should've ordered that) and a shortcake I believe.  Service was great and the meal was nicely paced.  We had some nice half bottles of wine with dinner as we're not big drinkers.  However, that wine list is very intimidating in size.  Luckily, if you are like us and are NOT super connoisseurs and NOT willing to spend more on wine than dinner, the wines by the glass and the small formats lists aren't too large.    I think the food and the atmosphere really make the place.  It's hard to gauge service at fine dining outside of it being horrible.  Given the price of the meal, anything they do is almost expected, right?  Our table was clean, our water was always full, silverware was clean and replaced with each course, and we were never looking for someone.  The primary server explained the menu and made suggestions, the sommelier came by, and I just really thought more about the food honestly.  Let's just say I didn't notice any service mistakes that would spoil our dinner.  Can't wait to come back again, I love this place...",

We got the 4 courses menu with wine pairing and believe me, you have to do the wine pairing.  The food were elegantly prepared but the wine we had stole the spot light.  The gentleman who came to explain each of the wines to us was so passionate.  It seemed like he had gone to Europe himself to pick the grapes and made the wine.  We took our time and enjoyed chatting in between each course, and it was a good 3 hour dinner.  I have nothing to complain about the portion or how much time we spent there.  We left the restaurant feeling very content and satisfied.  Personally, I didn't want to have a snack after that meal.  Of course, don't come here expecting olive garden portions (come on..).",

They make you feel very comfortable and offered to hang my jacket on my chair and even picked up my purse when it slipped off my chair. They also go the extra mile to to tell you about the interiors of the restaurant which helps you appreciate it even more and offered to take pictures for you at your table and by the painting they have at the entrance~  We went with the 5 course meal and it was delicious! For the main course, they offered 3 choices - I chose the lamb which was cooked medium rare, was tender, juicy and just the right portion! My second favorite dish was the seared foie gras with a side of fig.  The lobster salad was light and refreshing and the dessert was tasty too.    I highly recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "This restaurant is top notch! Service very good. Ambiance, very good. Clean! Several Picasso paintings priceless. Directed menu's that will please most palates. The Quail we had, cooked to perfection and very well balanced. Then we had the foie gras that was tasty, perfect temp. And also well balanced. I would have avoided the bread below and maybe done something different.. Then the Deer.... Rare and awesome. I did specify that all my meal should be without pork, and the preparation that went along had bacon.... So 1 less point for them!! Other than that,  This place did it!  As for wine, this place has an extensive wine list with huge bottles and hefty prices.... We were glad to have Michael Schwab as our somelier who directed us to a 5/5 bottle of wine for the price tag we were willing to pay. Thank you Michael. For desert, I always talk about my feeling that a chocolate desert is always good... That is the safe way to go... If you really want a desert that will blow your palate away, generally it will not be with chocolate.... So today I put the chef to test and ordered a cheese cake with earl gray ice cream. Wuau. The earl gray portion was amazing... The cheese cake I would balance different as the bottom crust is oreo... Would have preferred something more exotic. Espresso was creamy and well done. So thank you Picasso for a great dinner.",

    "text": "It's definitely one of the prettiest meals I had whilst in Vegas but I've definitely been to better Michelin star restaurants.  I think I may have hyped myself up for it a bit too much because I figured 2 stars would be way better than 1 stars (I've only been to 1 star ones up until now).    We had a prix-fixe 5 course meal which included lobster salad, scallops, foie gras, lamb and some sort of chocolate torte dessert.   The lobster salad was absolutely delicious and we were off to a good start.  Scallops were good too.  I'm not the biggest fan of foie gras but this was actually made quite nicely.  The lamb was a bit too cooked for my liking - apparently medium rare is hard to ask for (and I specifically say more on the rare side).  The dessert - I don't think I can write a fair review about because I was beyond full by that point.  But it was very pretty to look at!    Overall, service was great and ambiance was good but a bit noisy.  They give you a souvenir box with some chocolate chip muffins at the end (which were nothing special).  Definitely a fun experience but next time when I'm in Vegas, I'd probably go to another Michelin restaurant to give it a try.",

    "text": "This simply is the finest restaurant in Las Vegas! After 25+ years of visiting Las Vegas on a very regular basis, my only regret is that I had not visited Picasso before in it's 20 year history. The mistake I made (don't make this same mistake) is to assume it was just another pretentious Las Vegas restaurant that you had to take the time to dress up for, only to be disappointed by the service or fancy 1 bite food with an explosion of flavor that dissipates as quick as it came around. (Yes, I'm referring to Joel Robuchon) Unlike, Joel Robuchon which may be on a lot of  peoples bucket list, but once visited, I haven't met too many people who want to make it part of their regular trip itinerary. Picasso will be a regular part of my trip itinerary for my frequent trips! My only regret is that I've missed out on Picasso for the last 20 years assuming it was just another pretentious restaurant.  We frequent Chef Julian Serrano's other restaurants every time we are in Vegas, Julian Serrano Tapas at Aria and Lago at Bellagio, they are regular stops when we are in town, typically for lunch. We met Chef Julian briefly a couple months ago at Bon Appetit event in Vegas, several weeks later while at his restaurant at the Aria he recognized us and came out to say hi. At that point I decided my next trip I would make the effort to bring dress clothes and try Picasso (I'm typically all about being very casual in Vegas and don't bring any dress clothes) Now I will be packing dinner dress attire every trip just so I can have dinner at Picasso every trip!   Enough about me and hating pretentious food and dressing up, but I enjoy Vegas quite often... just so that I can dress down and have a casual fun time.  About Picasso itself, you obviously already know it's adorned with original Picasso's but it's done in a very classy yet comfortable fashion (again, I can't over use the word... the decor itself is done in an elegant fashion that isn't pretentious). We were greeted warmly and professionally (I find a lot of higher end restaurants train they're staff to treat guests as if this is the only time they will see them, because this may be only a special occasion dinner, in doing so the staff tends to prejudge their guests sometimes coming off as rude and yes pretentious!) Here we were treated like guests at a friends home, the entire staff was warm and friendly, close by to anticipate and attend to any need or question you may have, yet not hovering over you as to listen into a private conversation. There was attention to detail to the service at all levels from the Wait Staff to the Sommelier, they didn't feel the need to explain every detail of what was on your plate, (the food was so good it really spoke for itself and didn't require a 10 minute story for every course, to justify it's price) Yet, they eagerly anticipated and responded to any questions or comments the guests may have had. We chose the premium wine pairing with our meal, the Sommelier explained each wine without feeling the need to have to bore us with his infinite wine knowledge,  yet if you toss out a few questions he knew the answers, my kind of Somm!  I'm not a food critic so I'm not going to tell you about all the nuisances of the food, I will tell you that we enjoyed every course! There wasn't one course that didn't wow us and surprise us. If you are expecting a fake egg that isn't really an egg but instead explodes in your mouth with taste of saffron on lilac, this isn't the place for you. If you however love a quail that tastes like a quail but yet is probably the best damn quail that you ever had, this is your place. If you enjoy white asparagus cooked to perfection with a sauce that amplifies it's natural flavor as opposed to drowning with competing flavor profiles, this is your place! My wife doesn't like raw oysters, I myself don't like cooked oysters a conundrum in most cases, not at Picasso, Chef Julians poached oysters was a happy compromise for both of us. That's the beauty of a great Chef and Restaurant, when 2 people with competing pallets eat the same dish and both love it!  The Chef lets the natural ingredients speak for themselves and makes the flavors truly shine and cooks them to perfection in ways you can not find in to many restaurants.  After 25+ years of visiting Vegas and only going to the more pretentious restaurants when I was already packing dress attire and dinner jacket for a business meeting, only to then be disappointed by most, I will now be packing a dinner jacket for every trip as I plan on making Picasso part of my regular itinerary! This speaks volumes as I have never felt the need to do so in my past 25 years of visiting fine dining in Vegas.  Chef Julian, I'm sorry I had never frequented Picasso in the last 20 years, rest assured I will make up for that in the next 20!",

I love the ambiance, we got to watch the Bellagio fountains the whole meal as its right on the lake and the Picasso's throughout the restaurant are a nice touch.  The service was great, coming by just enough, but not too much.  They had a good wine and overall drink selection.    The amuse bouche of potato leek soup and pheasant croquette was a great way to start of the meal, it was warming and a simple taste to warm up the taste buds.  We went with the prix fixe menu.  I started with the poached oysters and my husband got the creme of butternut squash.  The oysters were fresh and large with a little bit of salt and bitterness.  So refreshing and delicious.  The creme on the other hand was smooth, rich and decadent.    The next course was foie gras au torchon and sauteed filet of black bass.  The foie gras was very rich as you would expect, so I was glad I had the oysters first.  The port wine reduction was a good balance with the sweet cutting through the richness.  The black bass was even better with crispy skin, soft rish, and a rich saffron sauce.  Finally are main meals were Fallow Deer and Veal Chop.  The deer was by far the best venison I have ever had.  It was so tender and rich, more like eating a very good filet mignon.  There was no gaminess but still unique flavor.  The green apple and zinfandel sauce were a little sweet and a little sour adding complexity to the dish.  The veal chop was quite big and rich throughout.    We finally finished off with desert.  We got a cheesecake and tart that were both delicious as well as some small bites.  They also give you some muffins to take home that were amazing for the morning.  Overall it is a lot of food, so come prepared.  We only took a few bites of the desserts as we were both stuffed by then.  Overall really recommend everything.",

    "text": "Eh, Picasso was ok.  The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, and the service is fairly attentive.  But there's something a little tired about Picasso's PRIX FIXE menu concept.  They have 2 versions, basically either a 3 or 4 course set menu.  You have choices within the menu itself.  And you can \"upgrade\" certain appetizers or entrees to like lobster or wagyu.  I dunno, seemed kind of tacky to me.  You're already paying at minimum a couple hundred dollars--no need to upsell for another $100 or more.  Just make it a whole different menu selection.  So, we were a group of four, and we all ordered the 4-course set menu.  We all got the foie gras.  It was good.  Not like what you get in France, but tasty enough.  And there was a soup--don't recall exactly what it was.  For the entree, two of us ordered the lamb.  Smallish serving, but ok.  The other two ordered the halibut (what was printed on the menu), but when the actual plate came out, the waiter said that it was sea bass.  And it looked and tasted like sea bass as well.  Not exactly a complaint, but a place like Picasso should run a tighter ship.  You should know your ingredient inventory and print your menus accordingly.  All in all, it just detracted from the whole experience.",

    "text": "Picasso is the epitome of FINE DINING. Everything was just SO CLASSY.  Atmosphere: SO classy. Did you know the place is decorated with REAL PICASSO Paintings??? How fancy is that? Of course since it's fine dining, it has a business casual dress code and it's very quiet and polite in the dining room.  Food: SO GOOD. You get a choice of 2 tasting menus. (different people can get different ones at the same table which I appreciated). We both got the Degustation Menu. SO delicious. The lobster salad and the lamb and the scallops and the giant dessert...omg. SO good. I cannot say it enough. Also, they give you a complimentary potato soup shooter pre-meal. They ALSO give you a complimentary array of petite fours after your meal (so if you don't want to order dessert, that could serve as your dessert nicely).   Wine: The sommelier they have is one of around 100 Master Sommeliers in the country. He was very good--you can tell he was super knowledgeable about wine and very passionate about it too. Well, he is a master after all.  Service: Everyone was just SO nice. From the host to the waiter to the bread waiter to the water waiter to the sommelier. They were all friendly and professional.   Bathrooms were beautiful.  Oh and it's good for small and large groups. Big enough dining room to fit many parties.  If you want fine dining at its best in Vegas, this is the place to go.   To TOP IT OFF: When you leave the restaurant, they give you this Beautiful little box of Fresh baked cinnamon cookies. OMG. WHO DOES THAT!?!?!? This is high class people. (Did you count? that's 3 different COMPLIMENTARY things they give you throughout dinner. That's AMAZING.)  The experience there just made me incredibly happy. =)",

Outstanding wine pairing! The selection of wines and the recommended pairing for food was perfect! Outstanding decor and atmosphere! These just add up to the overall dining experience!  We will go again next time in Vegas!",

We were pretty shocked by the diners at the next table that had no idea that was the shtick of this joint. They funnily asked the waiter when leaving if the prints were for sale, or if they were real. They were NOT prints. DUH. Somehow he also was allowed in wearing a Hawaiian shirt - when jackets are required.   OK - so the food....very good but not outstanding. Really lovely to be inside this place and enjoy the lake view, the fountains, etc. but the prixe fix menu was nothing spectacular. Next time I'll try the steak restaurant next door with the same view.",

I have been DYING to eat at Picasso since I moved to Las Vegas!! And now my company was picking up the tab!! Shwiiing!!  The food and service did not disappoint! Our server was Robert, and he was fantastic. Talk about not thinking about a single thing except enjoying your company, and the food, of course. Seamlessly the courses flowed to the table!  EVERY SINGLE course was incredible! Every bite a treat. I am not going to go on and on with the menu, because it changes and is printed to what is being served, or in season. There were 3 menus to choose from, each one was approximately 4-5 courses. Each choice allowed a slight variance, but basically you are there for  4-5 course dinner. And I hope that did not sound like a complaint? It was not, It was perfect!  I now understand why this is considered one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, and honor that it completely deserves.   I feel lucky to have had this dining experience, and will definitely consider it again for an occasion, or to bring someone I want to treat to something really special!",

After getting my chair and head hit mupltiple times by constant kitchen traffic we decided to relocate. Unfortunately they are unable to accommodate since the tables were pre \"reserved\" Enough said, do not plan on coming back and would not recommend for an important occassion since it seems they do not value customer service, just how many people they can fit in their restaurant in one night.",

    "text": "Ate here on my birthday 08/29/2013.  Last minute made dinner reservations and I've been  wanting to try this place since I worked in front of Bank Nightclub at Bellagio and passed by this every day at work.  We get there at 930pm and get seated really close to the windows looking out to the Fountains of Bellagio.  It was really nice, but quiet and dim inside the restaurant.  There are also outside patio seating available through reservation.  We opted for the 5 course meal $125 a person and some wine as well.  Before the first course...Amuse-bouche!   We had some kind of shooter that was really creamy and tasty, along with a bite-size piece of salmon, boiled egg, and caviar.  Course 1:  Maine- Lobster Salad - Delicious and ate all the tiny cantaloupe around it.  Course 2:  Seared Scallop with 'potato mousseline (aka mash potatoes lol) in a wine sauce.  Perfectly cooked and ate every bite.  Had to get every drop of the sauce too!  Course 3:  Foie gras! on top of toasted pistachio with deep red cherries.  The cherries sauce as you bit into them paired very well with the foie gras.   The foie gras as a big portion.  Course 4: I had the lamb, my honey had the halibut.  Both delicious.  The lamb came with assorted veggies plated well-artistically.  Halibut was served over asparagus.  Can't go wrong with either dish.  (You can pay $150 more to get authentic Japanese Wagyu/Kobe beef)  Course 5: Desert.  For my birthday the servers surprised me with a chocolate lava cake with ice cream.   The happy birthday message written on the plate was done so beautifully.   They also served another desert (pears with ice cream and panna cotta).  Following this, they served mini candies on a tiny silver dish.  All were great.  The service was top notch, highly attentive.  Our server was very friendly and made light conversation which was nice.  He was nice enough to offer to take our picture with our camera.  As we left, we were given 'parting gifts'.  Boxes with Picasso engraved which opened up and had chocolate muffins inside!   Go for the tasty food, the amazing view, and the excellent service!",

    "text": "Oh my word. I dined here in March 2011 and I do not remember much except for 4 things:  1. Excellent Service 2. Foie Gras 3. Bambi 4. I dropped the most expensive deuce in my life. Ever.   1.  Where can I begin?  Oh, man.  My sister and I dined here because she wanted to eat at \"somewhere nice,\" to which I happily suggested that we dine at Picasso.  When we arrived to the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by two hostesses and were seated at our table.  Note: It was DARK in here.  I wonder if the dim lighting was a ploy to enhance the appearance of the food, the people around me, or hide the ninjas lurking around the joint.  Our waiter was excellent in taking care of us.  He was at our beck and call and answered any and every question we had for him.  The servers were awesome as well, and well-versed in the food they brought out.  Absolutely bomb diggity excellent.  2.  Yes, I know.  The poor duckies.  As much as I am into advocating for the humane treatment of our fine, feathered friends..I just couldn't resist flying to Vegas to grab a taste.  It's reverse psychology to me.  Here, I'll try it on you.  Don't think about pink elephants.  It's bad, I mean it. Don't!  Oh, but you are!   Bad example, but whatever.   My first bite was extremely salty for some reason.  It felt like I had eaten a teaspoon of table salt. What the heck?  It was no biggie, because the second bite was pure fatty bliss.  It was perfectly balanced, floral, musky, meaty and fatty.  I think I lost about a year of my life from eating pure decadence.  My arteries were not happy.   3.  Get the fallow deer.  I asked my sister, \"what is fallow deer?\" She then told me to Google it.  Wikipedia presented a picture of Bambi to me.  Gosh darn it, Bambi,  why are you so melt-in-your-mouth delicious?  The Bambi medallions were cooked impeccably in a rich, red sauce that was delicately spooned onto my plate, table-side.  What a great presentation.    4.  After ending my meal with coffee and mignardises, after walking out of the restaurant and riding the escalators up into the casino, after feeling blissful from having dined at a fine establishment, AND after situating myself at a lounge to drink away the night, my stomach decided to expel ALL of the rich food I had the pleasure of having within the last hour.  Thank god the restroom was 10 feet from where I was seated.  Let this show you that the food was incredibly RICH, soo rich that my stomach couldn't bear it.   That was $200 down the drain.  Literally.   In any case, I absolutely enjoyed every second here.  We never felt rushed or judged upon.  It was just my sister and I basking in the greatness of good food, service, and company.",

Given the rigid complexion of the degustation, we instead ordered the malleable pre fixe.  As I (un)fortunately imbibed heavily prior to my visit, my memory is severely lacking concerning the details of our experience.  However, I do recall an intoxicating carrot and ginger soup, perfectly cooked quail, an incredibly delicate and impossibly flavorful preparation of sea bass, and a perfect full-bodied Rioja that almost reduced me to tears.  The only True miss of the night was an unnecessarily sour white wine that was meant to be paired with the aforementioned divine sea bass (the best dish of the night).  I skipped it entirely.  Also, I have sadly forgotten what constituted desert, but apparently, I enjoyed a very sugary rhubarb cobbler concoction and another dessert placed matured Pop Rocks into a strikingly exquisite preparation.  If you are looking for a nice, romantic restaurant on the Vegas strip (indeed, a bit too much so for my tastes), then Picasso is your sure fire winner.",

Here you can actually sit and enjoy the artwork on the walls as it was meant to be enjoyed, unlike when you are running through a museum trying to see everything.  So wonderful.    The food was excellent and perfectly presented (except for when they forgot to sauce our main dishes, but I forgive them).  It was so good, that even though I was coming down with some sort of stomach thing, I ate most of it.    I especially enjoyed dessert, even though I am not lately a big sugar person (I think the sugar made me feel a little better).  Green apple bombe - a beautifully presented short cylinder of green apple ice cream  on a thin meringue wafer, surrounded by an electric green gel (there has to be a better word to describe it) made into a beautiful pattern, topped off with a thin wafer of chocolate in the same pattern.  We also had the citrus dessert - I am still haunted by thoughts of the blood orange ice cream.  It's like torture!",

We had a wonderful meal - no question about that - but the \"after taste\" of this policy means we will not return to any of the Bellagio properties.

It's a great place to go if you ever feel the need to drop $200 on a meal (my poker winnings from that morning helped pay for most of my share).  The restaurant itself is gorgeous.  You enter through a beautifully tiled portion of the wine cellar, with some very expensive wines on display.  If you get a window seat, you get one of the best views of the Bellagio fountain.  And, of course, there are a number of original Picasso pieces on the walls, as well as the Picasso-themed plates and stuff.  Bathroom was a bit of a letdown.  It's pretty much the standard Bellagio public bathroom--nothing particularly special, but certainly classier than the one at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (the other Michelin-starred restaurant in Vegas that I visited).  There's a choice of a 4-course or a 5-course tasting menu.  They were very flexible with us--unlike at many restaurants, the whole table didn't have to order the same menu.  They also let some of us order the 5-course menu, but with a main course from the 4-course.  That was nice of them  Wine pairings are an extra $53 or $63, and a very good deal (given that you're paying $120 for the food).  Robert, our sommelier, gave us very detailed descriptions of all the wines, where they're from, tasting notes, why he chose them to go with our food, etc.  He even went through the trouble of going around our massive table, giving his spiel several times, so that all of us could hear him.  He was most of the reason I gave 5 stars instead of 4.  Note that the wine pairing doesn't cover the dessert.  Although some very sweet wines (Tokaji and Sauternes) came with the foie gras courses for both menus.  The food (I got the lobster salad, scallop, seared foie gras, short rib, and chocolate truffle beignet) was all very, very good.  Not usually a fan of foie gras, but this was perfectly seared, tasted wonderfully of fat and suffering, and went great with the peach compote and the glass of Tokaji Aszu.  The meal also comes with an amuse bouche (croquette and a shot of asparagus soup) and a couple massive trays of mignardises.    They also gave us cookies in really pretty boxes as a take-home type thing, but we lost those before we could eat them.",

    "text": "I came here on my birthday with my parents, and was extremely pleased with the meal we got.  It was one of the best meals I have ever had, comparing with 2-star Michelin rated restaurants in Italy and Spain.  We ordered the 5 course tasting menu, which cost around $110.  We brought two bottles of wine, so it ended up costing a little more, but the corkage was only around $35, so it was worth bringing in our own wines.  We had bottles of wine that we had been waiting to open for two decades, so we appreciated that Picasso did not try to charge $50/ bottle or simply not let us bring it in at all.    The story I have heard about Picasso is that when Steve Wynn was opening up Bellagio, he asked Julian Serrano, who at the time was the Executive Chef at Masa in San Francisco, to come and open up a restaurant in his hotel.  When Serrano politely denied the offer, Wynn decided to \"go all in\" and offer to decorate his restaurant at the Bellagio with $30 million worth of Picasso paintings and other artistic decorations from Picasso.  Being a Spaniard, Serrano could not refuse this offer, and opened up \"Picasso\" at Bellagio.  It has been one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas ever since it's opening.    Our meal was worth every penny, including all the fine things in life such as Lobster, Caviar, Foie Gras, and Lamb.  Every dish was well portioned (not too small, not too large), and we left very content.  All of the dishes were a wonderful fusion of Spanish and French, which defines Julian Serrano's cuisine.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, the Foie Gras was some of the best I have ever had, and the Lamb was also perfectly cooked.    I am not one who will give 5 stars to any nice restaurant. In fact, I am very picky when I pay this much (over $100/ person) for a meal.  Julian Serrano came through with an amazing meal, and Picasso came through with the decorations... or should I say Steve Wynn came through.  Either way, I'm very glad Steve Wynn knew how to get a Spanish chef to come to Bellagio.  Otherwise, I may not have had the opportunity to taste his food.",

    "text": "We were excited about dining at Picasso after reading great reviews, but our table of six could not have been more disappointed in the experience.  We had heard there were two menu options, but when we arrived, only the $150 per person menu was offerred without apology.  It wasn't until I read the preceding review that I learned that the restaurant \"ran out\" of the lesser priced menu.  The amuse buche was bland--a red pepper puree soup with a tasteless fried \"something\" that we jokingly referred to as a \"fish stick\".   The Maine lobster was good enough, but the poached oysters were--again--bland.  I'm afraid the word \"bland\" could be sprinkled throughout this review.  The only star item--and I do mean the ONLY standout offerred--was the foie gras.    The main entree was the most disappointing.  There was not a single beef choice except a $150 upgrade for Kobe beef.  Among the included options was a choice of pigeon which our waiter explained had a taste very similar to liver and that it was hit with the Asian crowd.  Both seafood options--the halibut and swordfish were dry, overcooked, and tasteless.  On the other hand, my lamb was well prepared.    When the waiter stopped by at the end of our meal to ask how we enjoyed dinner, I told him that if he wanted an honest answer, he should know that we were very disappointed.  He said, \"I'm sorry to hear that,\" then picked up our plates.  He could not have cared less.  To top it off, we tried six different desserts to share.  One in our party commented that one of the lavendar (we think) infused desserts tasted like soap.  We thought it was a joke, but in reality, she was right!  It remained untouched.  Our table of 6 spent over $1200 for our meal, and at that price, this restaurant deserves one star.  This was pedestrian fare at elegant prices.  Maybe it was the crowded Valentine's evening that caused the lackluster food.  In any case, it is unfair to charge standard prices for a sub-standard experience.  I called the restaurant this morning to share our experience, but they are not yet open.  I'll try again this afternoon, and I'll post back to this review about my discussion with the management.  Update 2-21-2010:  After calling Mr. Gilles Kolakowski, the manager of Picasso, I received a heartfelt apology for our disappointing evening.  He explained that Valentine's day found them with a significant spike in business.  In a follow up email, he asked that I contact him when we return to Las Vegas, so he could personally make a reservation for us.  Mr. Kolakowski promised that during our next visit to Picasso, he and his staff would demonstrate why the restaurant has routinely received rave reviews.  I am satisfied with the outcome, and I look forward to our next evening there.",

    "text": "Not so long ago, Picasso was frequently cited as one of the best, if not the best, restaurant in Las Vegas. It has since been surpassed, but remains a delight. The worst of my courses was good, and two of the courses (roasted foie gras steak; warm chocolate fondant with peanut brittle ice cream) were excellent. It's not just that each course is so good; each of the components of a course is good. Add in the paintings, beautiful floral displays, and the Bellagio fountains, and you've got a winner.  The menu is fixed price, offering either a four or five course meal. Wine pairings are available. The space is beautiful, with Picasso's (what else) gracing the walls. Huge floral displays add to the beauty. Lastly, there's a view of the Bellagio fountains. Service is efficient and friendly, and the wine steward does a great job of explaining each wine.  We started out with olive bread (very good) and an amuse bouche of smoked salmon with Osetra caviar, finely diced cucumber, all on some sort of thin baked cracker - also very good.  I got the menu degustation plus a wine pairing - 2 and 1/2 ounces of four wines, one for each course except dessert. I had: * Jonah Crab Salad: a small amount of fine bits of crab in a very light vinaigrette. Very good. * Diver scallop: a single large sauteed scallop sitting in a pool of potato mousseline and another sauce.  * Roasted foie gras steak. This was superb! The best I've had. Slightly crisp, super flavorful, melt in your mouth. * Turbot with mushroom duxelles - excellent. The fish was flavorful and moist. The mushroom duxelles were also delicious. * Warm chocolate fondant with peanut brittle ice cream. The ice cream was excellent. The fondant - a thin, crispy, small cupcake filled with semi-liquid chocolate. Both the cupcake and the filling had wonderfully rich, intense, dark chocolate. This was to die for - perhaps the best dessert I've ever had. * The meal ended with a few small cookies.  Picasso offers a winning combination of food, atmosphere and service, at a price which no longer seems so extravagant when compared to some of the newer restaurants in town.",

They sat us right in front of a Picasso, so we had to spend the evening staring at THAT (rough life, I know).    We went with the price fixe, and I chose the wine paring as well - highly recommended as they complemented the food perfectly.  I scored pretty well with my choices aligning to my palate, but unfortunately my wife's experiments were about 50%.  She didn't care for the quail salad and the swordfish (substituted from snapper, and not a great idea).  However, the chocolate benigets and peanut butter ice cream was, her words, \"the best dessert she'd ever had.\"  I don't think I'd go there again, however - it's a one and done place to say you've been there.  A bit too high price for client meetings, and there are better food places in Vegas to try as well.",

Well we got those wonders answered, the food was remarkable, it tasted nothing like anything I ever had. The shrimps were perfectly cooked and so tender, the oysters, OMG my favorite part, they were cooked in a broth that tasted like beef broth and white wine. Scallops were delicious. We opted for the Japanese steak, it was $150 extra and got a lamb loin, this wasn't so good, it was full of fat I left more than half of it. The foie gras was my least favorite, it just tasted like pure fat and had a gooey texture. All in all most of the food was really good and even though they are all small plates we were full by the end of the night. I wanted to give it 5 stars but because of those 2 items it gets 4.  PS. if you sit outside you get the beautiful view of the fountains, keep in mind you also get the water mist every time the fountains shoot up hard.

The roast lamb was also nothing short of amazing as it was buttery tender with a caramelized glaze on the outer skin of the roast. Avocado and Lobster salad was light with sweet springy meat. My neighbor had the main lobster ($40 upgrade) and I looked over with food envy.  Desserts were absolute works of art visually. My chocolate lava cake (don't remember what they call it there) was good though a bit on the sweet end in my opinion, but most people would love it.  We were there for a work function and service was good overall. We did feel they seemed a bit too anxious to make sure our dinner guests knew there was a $250 white truffle option, or to point the top end wine selections... my CEO and I were a bit turned off about that detail. But, that's all in the perception I suppose... generally the dinner was a success.  Ambiance was great... very impressive location next to the Bellagio fountain/lake. Great floral arrangements and the Picasso's make great talking pieces. For the food and ambiance, I'd go back.",

I have eaten in some good places in Europe that were pricey but coming in at 350 (yes pounds) for two, it's just not worth it. Actually, it's not worth a third of that. I don't know how they got those Michelin stars but it certainly wasn't up to European standards, nowhere near. The menu is unimaginative, totally bog standard posh restaurant fare. The service (except one nice chap who got scowled at for chatting to us) was cold, dull and condescending - I know what foie gras is, though thanks for the automated explanation, yes I know that Riesling is a grape variety, cheers - and if I didn't I wouldn't want to be told by someone as ill informed as your good selves in a manner that made me feel ultra-thick!  Good points, nice view of the fabled Bellagio fountains, bar maid was nice enough.  This is an 'upscale' restaurant for people who have too much dosh and usually live on Burger King. Only go if you have won so much money in the casino that you simply have to chuck some away. People keep asking if we lost money in Vegas - this was the only place that we could say we made a really misplaced bet.",

Imagine how aristocratic you feel dining in a restaurant with original Picasso paintings hanging on the wall, while also having a splendorous view of the Bellagio water fountain show throughout the dinner. The service was also remarkable. Anytime you leave the table for any reason, you get to come back to a nicely refolded table napkin! Talk about attention to detail! The waiters are also very informative and polite in giving you course suggestions and any apparent allergy food warnings.   And now, finally to the food. It was a total disappointment. yea right!! How could it not be exceptional?!! I ended up getting the Prix Fixe and my other half got the Menu Degustation. As usual, I forgot all the courses we had, but I know I got the oysters and fallow deer, and he got the scallops and kobe beef. Let me tell you, everything was exquisite and delicious, but the oysters and kobe beef were ambrosial. I couldn't get enough of it! The oysters were not in the slightest bit fishy, they were easily eaten, and they had this wonderful mix of flavors in it. The biggest highlight was the Kobe Beef. Words can't even describe how surreal it tasted. The flavor... the melting in the mouth... *ack* it's giving me chills just thinking delicious wondrous it tasted. The desserts were fantastic too. They also give you a gift when you leave. It's a cute small box with two pieces of dessert for later!   If you've got the money and you don't want to waste it on losing at the tables or slots, this is a must must must try!! Everyone should come here at least once in their lifetime!",

My husband and I had the degustation menu.   I was first impressed by the fact that they accommodated a party of 10 for whom they had no reservation. The gentleman insisted he came down earlier in the day to make the reservation, but it was not in the books. The staff took care of it quite neatly.   When we were seated for our 8:00 reservation, I was delighted to be seated at the window, with a perfect view of the fountains.    Lobster salad - good, not great. I expected more flavor. Very clean. Pan seared scallops with potato mousseline - phenomenal!  Foie gras - I finally know it's just not my thing. It was too rich for me.  Halibut - perfectly done. Perfectly. Asparagus done perfectly as well. Beggar's Pouch - yummy bread and rice pudding (chocolate!) stuffed in phyllo.   Then they brought out six bites of desserts. After all that food, we just couldn't touch it. Then, as we left, we were given a nice box of mini cinnamon palmiers. A nice final touch.   The service was impeccable. No hovering, no haughtiness, never felt uncomfortable. The place was nice, not stuffy. The Picassos on the wall were cool. :)  What truly made this a five star for me was the EXTENSIVE list of single malt scotch. YAY!!!! I had the pleasure of having a 25 year Glenlivet. So good, I had to come home and buy a bottle for myself. Of course, it will only be used for special occasions, and will always remind me of this visit. Will definitely come back again.  :)",

Even the bread sucked, tasted like a doughy dry mess from Costco or something. I could barely stomach it. I ordered the vegetarian menu and it blew. First of all, every dish had something fried in it that didn't belong in there. The heirloom tomato salad had this giant oily, over-fried mess they called a crouton baguette. Omg, I get this giant oily mess swimming in a shallow layer of tomato sauce that tasted like Ragu but was supposed to be gazpacho. Seriously? Then I have the sauteed fava beans in pea puree. Not bad, actually and truly on par with your top most favorite baby foods. And thrown in were these fried cauliflowers that really added nothing special to my baby food. Then came the butternut squash ravioli which were completely dried out and filled with downright butternut squash and nothing else. It was the blandest most dried out pasta I have ever eaten. No brown butter or sage to speak of. I mean, what the hell? The vegetable ragout was awful with these huge bland watery beets that tasted boiled or oversteamed, and was swimming in sauce that tasted like ragu yet again! (boy, this must be Chef Serrano's favorite go-to brand!) Other standouts for worst dish ever was the dessert, the hazelnut joconde. Dear god, I've never had such a dry cake in my life. It was layers of sawdust in between decent chocolate mousse. And it was served dead cold. I felt like I got one of those cakes from the frozen aisle but no one bothered to defrost it at all. My husband's degustation menu wasn't any better and I will spare you the details but it was equally unremarkable to downright bad. The main lobster salad was bland. The scallop was decent.  He said his foie gras was overcooked at the edges but the middle was edible. The loin of colorado lamb was overcooked - he asked for medium rare and got medium-well. And it was a tiny piece of meat too - how do you get this wrong???  His Chai Tea Poached Pear was actually pretty good. The ice cream wasn't overpowering and the poached pears were delicious. But for spending over $300, I feel robbed. I feel like I gambled and lost big time playing with the food roulette wheel of Vegas. Chef Serrano was either asleep or not there when we dined. Thanks for making me feel like you stole my money.",

A favorite part of the whole meal was the cheese plate, which was huge and varied.  Staff was friendly, patient, flexible, and efficient, and not pretentious.  The Picasso art borders on intimidating, but is really nice.  Everything here delights the senses, but, of course, robs the wallet.  I see a lot of reviews suggest this is a one time place, but for me, I would go back if I get the chance.  The menu changes with the seasons, and I am sure each time would be unique.",

    "text": "I don't understand why this place is so well-received. It was pretty disappointing, in my opinion. From our experience, it seems to be overrated. I generally really enjoy a prix fixe menu and trust that the chef will serve a uniquely set up series of thoughtful dishes; however, this was just blahhh and heavy. Each course was a protein including foie gras (which was very good) however, by the third course, I was getting full and wanting something more refreshing. By the last course, everyone at the table seemed to be over it.    Everything was expertly prepared, however; each dish lacked any sort of wow factor (besides the lamb dish - it was memorable). Seabass second course on prix fix menu was also very good. Lobster salad was also pretty tasty. However, Seabass main course on the other menu was bland and very boring. Deer dish on prix fixe menu was also uninspiring and boring. I usually love deer and was excited that i found it on a menu; however this had no unique flavor what so ever and just tasted like a drier and thinner cut of grocery store beef.    Desserts were hit or miss. Cheesecake and pear pastry were both just ok - edible. No one in our party finished those dishes. Chocolate dessert was incredible - best thing we ate all night.   Service was also blahhh. Couldn't understand server because he mumbled so we didn't get any of the dish explanations. Never interacted with us or made any special effort to be accomodating. It, like the food, was just underwhelming.  Although, hostess was extremely professional and accomodating.   Ambiance is dark but very quiet and nice - however, I would request a window or outside table if I ever went back again (I probably wont)  The art is incredible! It offers the very unique experience of eating amongst some of the world's most famous pieces of art.  Each person in our party came to the same conclusion - we were glad we tried it as it is a Las Vegas landmark; however, we would not be back. We had several far better dinners at far less expensive restaurants on the strip.  I really expected to be wowed and I was hardly satisfied. I was pretty disappointed because I had really high expectations for this place from all the awesome reviews from diners and critics alike...perhaps, that is why I feel so let down. I would like to think that this was just a bad night; although, after speaking to other locals in the area, they agreed that the place was overpriced and overrated.",

We did the pre fix menu, a 5 course delight! The staff was extremely professional and explained every detail of each dish. Each and every course came out as the chefs work of art...I really didn't want to eat it it was so beautiful! The highlight of the night was my choice of deer medallions with caramelized apples and beans with a wine reduction. With the fabulous glass of wine it was paired with, out of this world!!

I expected the food to be great but the portions to be really small.  We were surprised - the portions were generous enough that we were all 3 really full when we left!  Daughter had the wine pairings and the sommelier was amazing - nicest guy who was enthusiastic about each presentation & spoke in an authentic French accent or Spanish accent depending on where the wine was from which added to the flavor of the evening :)  The soup was artfully presented and absolutely delicious!! All the other entree items were beautifully presented, creative and most important, very tasty.  The desserts were show-stoppers too - and you get to choose from about 5 or 6! True works of art to wrap up a wonderful 2-hour meal experience.  They even added a candle and beautiful \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate finely written on our daughter's dessert plate.  The restaurant is pretty and there are genuine Picasso paintings hanging on the wall. The dinner plates & dishes are works of art as well.    A pricey evening but a once-in-a-lifetime experience when with your daughter on her birthday in Vegas. We all 3 loved it.",

The ambiance is very nice, and yes, the paintings are awesome and fun.   Service was solid and generally blended into the wall. I imagine some folks like that but not my thing.   In general, at this level of dining I would expect a little something special and I didn't feel like we got that.  But I certainly had a nice meal.",

While just trying to relax and kill some time before our reservation at Prime (across the hall), we ducked into this small bar and had a great time.  The bartender couldn't have been nicer (we were half-expecting to be treated badly since we were not dining there) and we struck up a great conversation with a nice couple from San Francisco.  The drinks were mixed very well and were a decent value considering you get to look at original Picasso's while you just sip away!",

The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.  I really enjoyed my experience here.  I went with their pre-fixed menu with wine pairing and was delighted with an awesome experience!  Here are the dishes I've tried:  - Maine Lobster Salad. Apple-champagne vinaigrette.  Wine pairing: 2009 Koehler-Ruprecht, Riesling Spatlese trocken, Kallstadter Saumagen, Pfalz, Germany pairing. (Very good salad.  Loved the vinaigrette and the balanced flavor between lobster and salad.)  - Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop. Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Wine pairing: 2011 Domaines Schlumberger, Pinot Gris, Les Princess Abbes, Alsace, France pairing. (Love the potato, silky smooth and the scallop was cooked to perfection)  -Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras. Poached Figs, Pistachios and Arugula.  Wine pairing: 2003 Clarence Dillon Wines, Clarendelle, Amberwine, Monbazillac, South France pairing.  (This is best Foie Gras I've ever tried. So creamy, silky, and delicious!)  - Roasted Tournedo Loin of Coloardo Lamb. Pisto, Mint Aioli and Tempura Zucchini Flower.  Wine pairing: 2007 Vina Pedrosa, Reserva, La Navilla, Bodegas Preze Pascuas, Ribera Del Duero, Spain pairing.  (Very well put together. My expectation for fine lamb has been elevated!)  - Poached pears with ginger ice cream and custard.   - Mango sorbet with mystery tart. Very good as well.  Overall, outstanding food and service all around.  A must try place for Vegas goers.  Btw, they take your feedback very seriously.  We left a nice note for the service team on a job well done.  The restaurant manager actually emailed us back and thanked us for the feedback.  She even ensured the service team got recognized for their great service.  This is the golden standard of customer service!",

My husband and I ordered different courses just to try them out. The tasting menu was $15 more expensive but it also had one more course. The presentation of the dishes was very nice. The taste of the food was forgettable.   I give this place a 4 star for the dining experience. If you are only looking for amazing food, I would not recommend Picasso.",

    "text": "As worried as I was that this place would turn out to be an overpriced tourist trap, I was pretty impressed with Picasso. The service was outstanding, the decor and ambiance were great, the view/location was nice. It's expensive but really not much if any more than a comparable meal/experience in a place like NYC or LA. I have to shave off one star because my first two courses were really subpar. Luckily, the main and the dessert were home runs, which, along with the stellar service, really saved the night.   I went with the prix fixe menu, here were my choices:  First: Warm quail salad Second: Ruby red shrimp Main: Fallow deer medallions  Dessert: Hazelnut joconde   The first thing that came out was the amuse buche of pheasant fritter and some sort of cold potato soup. The fritter was ok, a little salty and greasy, but the cold soup tasted like plain cream to me, maybe with a little garlic. My amuse was far from buched. I hoped it wasn't a sign of things to come.  The quail salad came next, and I thought it was just alright. Some portions were too gummy and greasy for me, so I didn't finish it. The crispy parts were awesome.   When I got the shrimp, I really started to worry. Although the accompanying flavors/textures were great, the shrimp themselves did not taste fresh to me at all. It was at this point that I was really starting to regret my decision to even come here.  Luckily, my entree was the beginning of a complete 180 for the night. The meat was cooked perfectly and was seasoned just right. All the flavors meshed well, and I devoured the whole thing.   Dessert started with another amuse buche, and this time it was excellent. 5 mini desserts from the pastry chef. By the time I finished sampling these, I was completely full, but I wasn't going to that stop me. The Hazelnut joconde--which, for some reason, was very very different from what was described on the menu--was amazing. Rich, chocolaty, nutty and beautiful to look at, it was everything you could hope for in a dessert--nay, in life. A couple pours of coffee offset the sweetness just right. Despite my best efforts, there was no way I could finish. I was just too stuffed. The (figurative) icing on top of the night was the farewell accompanied by two mini chocolate chip muffins for the morning.  So, would I come back? Probably not. Although I had an overall good experience, two courses that miss the mark is two too many at this price point.",

I had the degustation menu ($125): potato-leek soup and pheasant amouse bouche, lobster salad, scallop, foie gras, halibut, and mango sorbet. My wife had the prix fixe ($115): quail salad, foie gras, fallow deer. My in-laws had the degustation with the lamb. We all did the wine pairings ($65/$55).  My favorites were the quail, the pistachio foie gras, the scallop, and the deer. If I were to return, I would instead sacrifice the scallop and do the prix fixe, ordering what my wife did.  The wine pairings were great, definitely helped make the meal. Great service, and hard to complain about dining in a Picasso gallery with the Bellagio fountains outside.  One other delightful moment came right as we arrived. My wife sat down and thought, I need a purse hanger. Two seconds later, our waiter handed her a purse hanger. :)  All told, the bill with tip for the four of us was $1050. We didn't order any other drinks, but it was also fun to just peruse the enormous awesome wine list.",

I can not say enough that our waiter Robert was just phenomenal and overall amazing, he made our whole experience and my mother's birthday one not to forget.

    "text": "This meal was $207 for myself. Picasso is super expensive. That being said, the food was world-class.  I opted for the Degustation menu. This includes bread, amuse bouche, Maine Lobster salad, Seared Dayboat Scallop, Foie Gras, Colorado Lamb Tournade, Chocolate Bread pudding, and petit fours bites.   The olive bread and baguette were lackluster. I actually prefer the gourmet bread from my local grocery store. The bread was cool, tough on the bite, and lacked flavor, moisture, and seasoning.   The amuse bouche was a quail croquette with chilled corn chowder. The croquette is a fried stick of quail with cheesy sauce filling. Alongside the corn chowder, this was a soulful entry into the meal. Lots of savoury flavors to prime the palate. This dish was not a palate cleanser as many amuse-bouches.   The Maine Lobster salad was excellent. Cool chunks of fresh lobster packed with a light vinaigrette, shrouded with delicate bitter greens, light onions, and a very subtle hint of black truffle that lingers effervescently on the palate. The dish tastes quite fresh and is a nice movement from the amuse bouche to lighten the palate.   The scallop was the texture of cold butter with the taste of meaty seafood. It was deeply seared and served over a potato puree. The dish was lovely.   The seared foie gras was a standout. This is the best method of serving foie. The outside holds a deep crisp while the inside is buttery and deeply unctuous in a uniquely poultry-offal manner. The black cherry glaze and deep crunchy bits on the plate balance out the soft mouthfeel and fatty savour of the foie gras. This is a combination of flavors that cannot be replicated with any lesser ingredient.   The lamb tournade was just OK. The mouthfeel was slightly tough. The lamb's exterior did have serious maillard charred complexity. Is wasn't too impressed with the flavor of the meat or it's texture.   The chocolate bread pudding was like a light brownie. The plate many interesting and complex bits of flavor.   The meal was finished with some small bites from the kitchen that were pleasantly sweet and soft. These encompassed several flavors on the sweet/salty/bitter spectrum.   Picasso is an amazing environment with good, but not impeccable, service. The interior is beautiful and it is set on the lake of the Bellagio with fountains gushing every 15 minutes. This is an unforgettable place to dine on incredible food. While there were a few hiccups, Picasso was an excellent dining experience.",

My wife and I were staying at the Bellagio and planned on going out after dinner to Omnia. We walked in me were escorted to a great table overlooking the nightly fountain show and the Eiffel Tower. Ordered some mocktails and proceeded to order from the menu degustation. Between us, we had the lobster salad, pan seared scallop, foie gras, roasted loin of lamb (wife had the turbot), and finished off with desserts including a apple crumb ice cream with crepes and a fudge brownie with ice cream. The lamb was delicious, as were the scallops (and I'm not a huge fan of scallops generally). Moreover, after the dinner we received branded boxes with dark chocolates which we finished within the next day.   The seating was intimate, service was attentive and helpful, and the presentation was unique. I look forward to future visits when back in Las Vegas!",

It does not come cheap but definitely money well spent when your guests got to enjoy the world renowned Bellagio Water Fountain Show for over four hours and closest to the action that anyone can wish for.  It is not often one sees the water fountain show with the strip traffic in the background.  The food was superbly prepared and service meticulously detail oriented.  Other than the dessert was too much on the sweet side, it was one of our most memorable Vegas dinning experience.  Looking for another excuse to repeat.  Highly recommended.",

I would highly recommend seating outside where you can truly enjoy the Vegas Strip backdrop as well as Bellagio fountain show, which I have seen dozens of times but never gets old and is especially enjoyable from this unique perspective.  To be honest, I came here with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary so we placed a priority on atmosphere and I was not expecting too much from the food. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the food which was delicious. The service is also top-notch. They are friendly and accommodating without being too overbearing. They are also more than happy to take pictures for you, which you will definitely want to do when the water show begins.  All-in-all, I would recommend and I will definitely return in the future to celebrate a special event or just to enjoy a nice night out.",

The handsome manager himself went on the internet to see if he could find the instructions and also tried his best to figure it out. He was attentive the whole time we were there.   The ambiance is definitely a 5star.",

The service is obviously fantastic, they don't rush you, they'll take the time to explain anything on the menu and it just seems like the waiters genuinely enjoy their jobs? Hard to find in the restaurant industry.  The food was absolutely delicious, the waygu steak was a $150 upgrade and I eat massive amounts of food so I didn't think it would be enough. I was totally wrong, I was full halfway through the steak. They bring out so many side dishes that aren't on the menu but are part of the \"experience\". The waiter came back often, but not often enough that he felt overbearing. The view is absolutely beautiful, we were seated way inside the restaurant but could still see the Bellagio fountains outside.  The presentation was clearly amazing, as you can probably see from the pictures. The food was absolutely beautiful.   They also give you this really nice box when you're leaving with a sweet surprise in it, we got banana bread, yummmm.",

    "text": "I was completely swept off my feet by all the details that went into the evening my husband and I had at Julian Serrano's Picasso.   We arrived for our 5:30 pm reservations. I originally had plans to sit indoors and appreciate the artwork as we dined. When given the option for indoor or outdoor seating, and glancing at the  spectacular balcony view of the Fountains of Bellagio around sunset hour, we did not hesitate to pick the outdoor option. We were seated at the table closest to the fountain and the sight and sound of the powerful and well choreographed fountain shows really added romance and charm to the evening. I glanced over at my husband and wonder if he orchestrated all of this, since it was our belated Valentine's Day dinner. Nope. Picasso was the visionary behind it all.   I ordered the Menu Degustation and my husband ordered the Prie Fixe so we can try a variety of Julian Serrano's inspirations. I ordered The Blue Period cocktail and I loved it! I loved the inspiration behind the name and the subtle fizz and cucumber flavor.   \"Menu Degustation\"  Maine Lobster Salad - Succulent lobster meat with flavorful vinaigrette, and fresh tomatoes, honeydew, and cantaloupe.   Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop - Tender scallop seared beautifully and paired well with the soft potato mousse layer on the bottom. I took little bites of the scallop at a time to savor the deliciousness.   Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras - Hands down, the best piece of foie gras I've ever had. Every bite presented an explosion of fatty, savory, and juicy moments in my mouth. I still dream of that piece of foie gras today.   Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb - Cooked perfectly medium as requested and so tender as I cut into it. I appreciate how the lamb flavor was very subtle and the meat was prepared simple, but so flavorful. The zucchini flower tempura was so delicate and fun to eat.   \"Prie Fixe\"  Poached Oysters - My favorite of my husband's choice of dishes. The buttery sauce and caviar was a new fancy way of eating oysters for me. I've also never had oyster poached and it was really good.   Foie Gras au Torchon - Not as delicious as my piece of foie gras but for some strange reasons, the sweet apple tart really paired well with the foie gras.   Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer - Our first time having deer and it tasted just like steak but with a little gaminess. Cooked perfectly medium rare as requested.    Service was impeccable. I personally thought the service that evening tops several Michelin rated restaurants I've dine at, which includes The French Laundry. Our server was exceptional and accommodating. I appreciate the outdoor heaters and how he was so kind to adjust it several times for me. We felt like the service revolved around our dinner where finished plates were taken away, new utensils arrived, and water was refilled (many many many times) all at the right timing. Everywhere I turned on my way to the restroom, there was already someone there opening the door or directing me. The service really made the evening extra special.   There was one table that was getting a bit loud a one point of their dinner and I liked how our server approached them in a very professional and tactful manner. Usually when I dine out and there happens to be a rowdy table, the servers ignore it, and that affects all the other diners. I like how our server did what needed to be done so everyone else can enjoy their dinner experience.   Thank you Picasso for a wonderful evening of food pleasing to the eyes and mouth, amazing service, and beautiful scenarios. You were the highlight of my Vegas trip and I truly hope to dine with you again. Maybe next time, we will sit indoors and not only savor the food art, but the actually Picasso art as well.",

    "text": "Our prix fixe dinner here was good but not amazing. What immediately stands out is:  1. Awesome, attentive service 2. Beautiful view of the water show through the windows 3. How unbelievably long the dinner was. By the 3rd (out of the 4) course, we were already so tired of eating and had been at the restaurant for 2+ hours. True to the French roots, food comes out at a really leisurely pace. I had wished we lied and said we had a show to catch, because by the time we were done with dinner, 3 hours had gone by.   My family tried the Seasonal Truffle menu the last time they were here and said it was 100% not worth it so we all opted for the regular, 4-course menu.   1st Selection:  A. Poached oysters were a favorite around the table - no complaints!  B. The Warm Quail Salad was more quail than salad, and I'm totes happy with that ratio! It comes with 4 pieces of quail, all beautifully roasted for a crispy skin. Plus the meat is wonderfully juicy. I'm not a fan of oysters, so the salad was a happy alternative.   2nd Selection:  A. Foie Gras did not live up to expectation. Really generous portions, but we were expecting actually a piece of the liver. Instead it had more of a pate texture and was pretty average in terms of seasoning. It came with some slices of apple pie and was more of a sweet than a savory dish.  B. Big Eye Tuna Tartare was refreshing and pretty straightforward. It was a simple dish of tuna, avocado, and ponzu-like sauce that was more Japanese-inspired than anything else. It wasn't mindblowing, but it was definitely fresh and a light alternative! My family actually enjoyed the tuna tartare more than the foie gras, which really doesn't say much since they were both pretty mediocre.   3rd Selection:  A. Salmon was generous and perfectly cooked. It was just the right amount of fatty salmon + lean salmon meat, with a crispy skin on top. Super happy with this!  B. Veal Chop was just alright and honestly not something we would ever order again. It was underwhelming in its unoriginality.  C. The Deer was actually the winner of the night! Super tender and the flavor was just so on point! Rich and bold, without being overwhelming. Plus the accompanying green apple was an A+ complement!   Dessert:  A. Apples + Cinnamon Crepe - definitely pass on this! I regretted ordering this so much. The crepe is a thick, tasteless texture and the apples were overwhelmingly sweetly baked.  B. Poached Pear was pretty good, especially if you like your pie crust! It had a layer of crust underneath that made it resemble a pear tart! A little too sweet for my taste.  C. Pumpkin Bread Pudding was pretty good too. A good option for those looking for a mixture of textures - there's the soft gooey bread pudding + ice cream + crunchy cookie complements.  D. THE WINNER = Pineapple passionfruit tart. A nice tart, tart! Refreshing and definitely does the pineapple justice with its sweet and tangy theme! Also the accompanying lemongrass balls were a nice touch that broke up the fruity sweetness of the dessert.  Overall, I honestly don't think our prix fixe menu was worth the price tag of $100+/ per person. Some of the dishes were good, but they weren't THAT good. Would not recommend unless you're looking for a long dinner (with a view) with a variety of dishes, and price is not a consideration.",

The view was pretty much the best view I have ever had in a restaurant like ever!  Food was good. We ate the prix fixe menu. Of the dishes I thing the bests were the squash soup which was really good and did not taste like regular squash soup as well as braised beef which was pretty good. In addition my wife loved the melted chocolate cake.   We did the wine pairing which is a must. The sommelier comes to your table and gives u the wine and also tells you a little back story on the wine which was really cool.   Again the views are not to miss!!!",

    "text": "We came here for dinner to celebrate my birthday & I was not disappointed.  The service, presentation of & the food, all received high marks.  The staff was extremely polite, all saying hello or good evening when our party walked by them as we entered the restaurant.  Although polite they were very professional & did not cross the line of being so polite that they were annoying.  Our waiter was charming & the decor was great.  Amazing flowers in the center of the dining room & of course the artwork.  The food was amazing.  Every course was incredible.  The best 2 were the scallops & 7ozs of kobe beef.  Course 1: Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette      This was very refreshing & a great way to start the evening.  Course 2: Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline, Crispy Leeks and Jus de Veau.      The sea scallops were amazing.  As far as sea food goes the scallop is underrated in my opinion.  Course 3: Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras with Olsen Cherries, Crushed Almonds and Baltos Cinnamon Reduction      The Foie Gras was great, no surprise that the Cherries complimented the dish perfectly.  Course 4: Sauteed Filet of Halibut with Sauteed Royal Trumpet Mushrooms and Roasted Sunchokes      The halibut was cooked to perfection, it flaked off & tasted wonderful.  Course 5: 7 ounce Filet of Kobe Beef with a ring of mashed potatoes.      What an unexpected treat to have Kobe Beef available as the main entre.    Desert: Everyone was happy with their desert.  They wrote happy birthday on my plate with chocolate sauce & my souffle was sinful.    We had 2 bottles of wine, '03 Jo Phelps Insignia & '05 Groth Cab.  Sorry Mr. Phelps but the Groth is tasting better @ half the price.   A great place to cap off the perfect day.  I would love to have another birthday dinner here.",

    "text": "Wow, an absolutely unforgettable experience.  We arrived about 20 minutes before our reservation, so we decided to sit at the bar and have some drinks.  We weren't opting for the wine pairings for dinner, so we had cocktails.  I ordered a vodka tonic, and my buddy ordered a Makers Manhattan.  The drinks were fabulous, these guys take all aspects of your dining experience very seriously.  After pouring my friends Makers Manhattan, he noticed a microscopic sliver of ice that made it into the drink, immediately poured it out and made another.  My drink was equally as awesome, which had a splash of freshly squeezed lime juice.  The hostess was absolutely gorgeous, and the rest of the service, impeccable.   I opted for the 5 course, which consisted of a Maine Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallops, Sauteed Foie Gras, Roasted Lamb and a Chocolate Fondant for dessert. In addition, a cold corn bisque with a side of boiled quail egg and smoked salmon was served before the first course, which was amazing. The combination of quail egg and salmon was a perfect pairing.  For those that care, the restaurant is on the fountain side of the Bellagio, has a notable collection of authentic Picasso's, and has a great ambiance. Also- given the quality of the food and service here, the prices are quite reasonable, the 5 course as described above was around $120. The place isn't pretentious at all, and they're not dress code nazi's, though diners are well dressed for the most part. If you're looking for a fine dining experience in Vegas, I highly recommend that you pay Picasso a visit.",

You pay for the view of the Picasso's inside as well as the view of the fountains outside. Once you finish dinner, you can always have a seat on their patio and enjoy a few more fountain shows.",

To his shock, he loved Picasso and was stunned at the refined elegance of the restaurant, food, and staff.  Absolutely fabulous dinner! My husband and I had dinner at Picasso last night and thought it was simply amazing. The ambiance is simply the best in all Las Vegas. The entire place is quiet, refined and elegant- a welcome respite from the sometimes over the top crowds of Las Vegas.  We were seated at a table outside on their patio.  We had requested a quiet spot. Our table for two was private with a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains.  It was as if we had the entire show to ourselves!  Sometimes if you sit outside, the staff can forget you.  Not here! The staff were attentive and professional.  World class service!  Our table captain, Roger, was a native of Paris, France and he had a thorough knowledge of the wine pairings chosen to accompany my meal.We have dined in many countries around the world (London, NYC, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, etc) and believe Picasso ranks with the top Michelin star restaurants we have dined at. If you want a truly wonderful dining experience and a refined Las Vegas meal, Picasso is the place to go!",

I'm not a white wine fan, but they paired a New Zealand Sauvingon Blanc with a seafood appetizer, and the combo was amazing.   Between the wine, the food, the 5 or 6 original Picasso's on the wall, or the Bellagio fountains, truly worth the price of admission.",

You do not have to order the same number of courses, which was a nice option to have.  My choices on this day were: quail salad; Kobe beef spears, Wagyu short ribs and panacotta for dessert.  They were wonderful choices.  The portions were generous.  Of the four courses, the Quail salad was my favorite.  Four hearty portions of quail pieces and some greens to accompany the dish...it is usually the other way around at other places.  Equally impressive were the Picasso paintings on the wall coupled with the Bellagio water show you can see outside.  But it is pricey.  With wine, it could set you back $150/person.  So win a lot of money at the gaming tables before you go.",

However, because we chose outside seating, we got one of the best views possible from any restaurant (Dare I say... one of the best in the world?). I would probably say it was worth the price just from the view alone- we had a front row seat for the Bellagio fountain water show, and eating in that atmosphere, watching the show and taking in the view of Las Vegas is an experience I won't soon be forgetting.  The food was--- not up to my expectations. Maybe I had really high expectations because of all the 5 star reviews from yelpers and friends. We had the $95/person tasting course, and I have had better food at other restaurants that were less pricey. The fish all tasted a like, and the meat was kind of dry. The oysters, however, were fantastic. As for dessert... too sweet in my opinion.  The wines were waaay over-priced, but I guess that is what you can expect at this kind of ritsy restaurant.  The service was okay as well. Of course, they never let your water glass reach emptiness, and they bring your food while it is hot. They smile politely and make polite conversation. However, it just felt like they were doing their job (which I am sure they were) and not really too \"genuine\" and warm.  I am super-happy I got to have this experience though!.. like I said, the view from the outside balcony/courtyard (however they call it) is just delicious :).",

I have screwed up enough anniversaries over the last 17 years, and this one helped repair a lot.  The art is the real stuff...  and yes I walked around and looked, trying not to bother the people already seated We ate relatively early so the restuarant was not full when we got there.  Truly some amazing pieces, including the mosaic he did.  The wine list is great and the wine flights were well selected, and fit the menu perfectly.  As noted elsewhere the foie gras is stunning (I can still remember it).  The rest of the meal was great, the staff was superb.  We were well taken care of without feeling crowded.  The meal was a bit pricey, about $350 for two of us, but worth every penny.  Interesting side note...  This is not a kid friendly place (what restaurant is if it takes 2-3 hgours for a meal), but there was an asian family there with a 6-8 year old that made it through the whole meal.  Wow, my three kids would have been coloring on the walls by then.",

But reading the menu I had always been reluctant because there is a serious lack of creativity and it seems dated.    Turns out my preconceived perceptions were accurate. Eating here is like a culinary time warp back to 1985. With an ambiance that is very quiet and stuffy (not good when your in Vegas).  We did the degustation menu (which based on reading previous reviews hasn't changed in a very long time). To recap Lobster Salad, Scallop, Foie Gras & either Turbot or Lamb (I chose the turbot) followed by choice of dessert.   What the restaurant deserves credit for is service and execution. Although the dishes were rather boring conceptually in each case the protein was cooked perfectly. Maybe the best seared scallop I have ever been served. Thus the 3.5 rating.   If you are dining with the elderly or are not an adventurous diner you'll probably be very happy. But, if your like me and prefer something lively, innovative and unique Picasso is not for you.",

    "text": "Eating here is a life-changing experience unless you were to the manor born. I wish there was a little more granularity in the Yelp rating system -- there's 5 stars and then there's these sorts of singular experiences.  I've only been here once and it could be said I'm still paying off the tab, but what a night.  Picture it:  Las Vegas, 2003.  It was right after Thanksgiving; Herself and I were young, in love, and wanted a night to remember.  We go to the Bellagio concierge desk and ask for a restaurant recommendation.  She takes out the big book of all the menus and we browse.  Picasso stands out, but I do not remember the prices being on the menu (and yes I do know better).  The computer says they're full but she calls over anyway and they'll make room for us in the early seating.  I still regret not knowing how to give her a tip.    Herself starts getting ready and I go for a swim to make room for dinner.  It's late November in Vegas and the wind is cold -- I lost as many calories from shivering as I did from the deliberate aerobic activity.  6:30 is on us in a flash.  We descend the escalator into the depths of the Bellagio's north wing.  They really should require jackets here, but I got in anyway.  They put us in the back.  Of course, \"in the back\" was filled with museum quality art.  Not to be indelicate, but there was even a Picasso print in the bathroom.  Late fall brings the white truffle tasting menu and the \"usual\" menu degustation.  We go one of each and I have the suggested wines.  I'll never be a real foodie because I can't recall the specifics of either of our meals, but she remembers her main course was filet migon resting on a bit of truffle oil coated goodness.  I had a quince tart for dessert and hers was a poached pear with a white truffle creme anglaise.    When you think of fine dining service, you're thinking of Picasso.  More effort was put into the delivery of our meal than into most of the new houses being rapidly knocked up around Las Vegas.  The head waiter/sommelier didn't make me feel bad for going for eau de Lake Mead rather than Pellegrino (I don't think they had come up with artisinal water yet).  He also took the time to explain each glass of wine he brought over to me.  When Herself asked why the table of Japanese hipsters were having their wine poured into a separate glass serving vessel thing, I explained what little I knew about decanting.  I asked if the bottle they were having really was that old and bunged up with sediment, the sommelier said no, but it was $600 so he felt like he should give them the full monty.  I never was made to feel out of place.    I had the dreaded \"can you come and talk to the credit card company\" walk of shame up to the host stand, but I worked it out.  Considering how expensive Vegas is now, the price scales pretty well and the wine pairings weren't out of line with what you'd pay in a lesser establishment.     While I do okay for myself, my dining choices really should stay more in the In-N-Out and Pluto's line.  But Vegas is like LA, except worse.  When in Rome, engage in conspicuous consumption.  Suspend reality, clean yourself up, and try to get a table.  It would be nice to sit by the windows, though.  And next time, I'm going to wander around and soak up every piece of art, even if it's rude.",

I am sometimes one of \"those\" people who looks at the bottom of plates to see where the come from (I've found \"kirkland\" more than a number of times) but here the dishes are specially made for the restaurant.

    "text": "Las Vegas mogul Steve Wynn has some noteworthy accomplishments to his name, perhaps none more so than luring Julian Serrano away from Masa's in San Francisco.   With two-star Michelin recipient Coi still etched in my hypothalamus, Picasso had to follow one of San Francisco's best. Located in the Bellagio, Picasso's ambiance did not disappoint. Eleven Picasso paintings - exceeding over $100 million - adorn the walls; additionally, we were seated near a window with an eye-level perspective of the \"lake.\"  The amuse was a salmon-marscapone wrap, a cucumber-mint salad, quail egg with osetra, and a corn soup. The silky smooth raw salmon with the cold cucumber was a refreshing bite after the soup.  The tasting menu's first course was a lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette, tomato, cantaloupe, and celery. After overcooked lobster at Mesa Grill, I savored the tender chunks of decadent crustacean.  Next came the scallop with pomme puree, and a jus. In essence, this dish involved two items: a scallop and a potato. Such straightforward simplicity necessitates extraordinary execution. I enjoyed it all - the crisp potato chip, the creamy pomme puree, and the just slightly warmed through scallop.  The third course was foie gras, honey-Muscat poached pear, crushed almond, brioche, creme fraiche gastrique. The foie gras needs no elaboration beyond saying that it was pure opulence. As surreptitious as Goldman Sachs receiving $13 billion as part of the initial AIG bailout, a piece of brioche soaked up all of the fatty drippings. I am wont to see citrus and liver; in this dish, however, I can chalk up the pear as yet another fruit and foie permutation. The toothsome almonds sufficiently lightened the dish and contributed a needed textural counterpoint.  The tasting menu's main courses were not nearly as exciting as the prix fixe, so I chose the squab with asparagus, carrot, wild rice risotto, and a wild game jus. After the fusillade of meat and fish Mesa Grill piled in front of us, it was a welcome adjustment to see a more reasonable meat to vegetable ratio. The quickly seared pigeon left the breasts a lusciously mouthwatering crimson. To the touch, it felt like a pudgy cheek. A cherry note could be detected in the jus, obviating any possibility for the squab to be too salty. Wild rice takes forever to cook, so I appreciate the laborious dedication the kitchen put forth just for an accoutrement. The copious amount of parmesan made the side dish even more inviting.  My dining companion went with the veal chop served with a rosemary potato, and wild mushrooms. The rosemary sprig impregnated the potato's paunch with its herbal fragrance. As for the thick chop, it was more tender than pieces of veal tenderloin that I have tasted. The savory part of our meal could not have ended on a more Elysian note, as the Bellagio water show commenced, bellowing Andrea Bocelli's \"It's Time to Say Goodbye.\"  The cheese course featured several cheeses from Spain that I really liked, especially one with a raisin rind. The petite fours and box of pastries were a nice end to the meal.   Picasso reminds me of a well-engineered roller coaster - to wit, the first three dishes take you up to the top of the steep slope, the next two - foie gras and squab/veal chop - can be considered the exhilarating drop, and finally the ride comes to a smooth and most satisfying end, as the kitchen returns you back to the station, leaving you helplessly yearning for one more go-round.",

    "text": "The BEST restaurant I have tried in Vegas so far. (And I've been to many).  I booked during CES week a month in advance - booking early is a must for anyone attending CES. I read a lot of great reviews in Yelp, and they are all correct.   Amazing food!  First, location is not that easy to find. Walk on the shopping side of Bellagio, and it's downstairs from the shopping center (near Giorgio Armani). There's a tiny little free-standing sign that is easily missed, in all the colors of Vegas.   We had 6 people at the table. They first served us amuse bouche. Most reviewers loved the amuse bouche, and I can't more agree. We had a celery soup and deep fried seafood croquette. It was perfectly paired together.  Each of us tried either the Menu Degustation or Prix Fixe meal. I had the Prix Fixe.  Starter = Butternut Squash soup. Basic butternut squash soup - nothing special, but butternut squash never really is.  Main Course = I ordered the Lobster (supplement of $40). Worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY. Large pieces of lobster in a light veggie broth. The lobster was cooked to perfection and was to die for.  Dessert = You get any choice from the dessert menu. I had th key-lime pie with the rum ice-cream. Delish! You can tell the key lime was from REAL limes, and you can taste the rum in the ice-cream.  They also served us several trays of petite desserts to go with our coffee.  Each one you can tell was hand-made.  Why only 4 stars? The service was lacking. The bread server didn't bring my bread as requested (bread is mediocre - but ask for the olive oil with the bread. Quality olive oil.)  Our main server was excellent. One of my wine glasses got stains on it (from me), and the server got me a new glass. He even got me ANOTHER new glass of red wine to try myself, as he thought it was his fault.  At end of evening, the hosts (I only saw Men at Picasso), gave all the women a box of butterfly cookies with cinnamon to take home. Beautifully boxed to end a beautiful evening.",

    "text": "The food here is delicious, but the service here is seriously lacking. It amazes me that a supposed 2 star Michelin restaurant could have such poor service. Maybe it was because we were a younger group or the fact that we didn't order any wine, but regardless if you are paying $180+ per head minimum you expect better.  1. The waiter came by to explain their 2 menu options: 5 course tasting or 4 course pre fixe. Without asking if we were ready or needed time he then walks abruptly away to attend to a different table. We had to wait for another 10 minutes before we were able to flag him down despite 4 wait staff standing in the middle of the dining room watching us with our open menus. Nobody came by.  2. We were brought butter early on, but the bread guy came by, looked at our table and walks right by us. We had to flag him down as well and wasn't offered bread until after our first course was served.  3.  We had 6 people in our party. Not huge. But for some reason they were unable to serve us all at the same time. On at least 2-3 course 3 of us would get our food first followed by the rest 1-2 minutes later. They should never plate separately at a fine restaurant.  3. They could not keep track of what each of us ordered and would mix up our plates.  4. They overcooked their Wagyu. When asked the end of the meal how the food was, my friend said her steak was not good. Our waiter smiles and says nothing - no apologies.  All in all I would not recommend this place. Even though the food actually is pretty good there are so many fine restaurants in Vegas with great food and service. Spend your money elsewhere.",

The food is beautiful and the service, impeccable. If you want Vegas romance, this is your place.  Our party went for the $125 Degustation menu with four main courses followed by dessert. Even though the price is steep, it was reasonably priced given then setting, ambiance, service, and food. Everything about it was on point and I couldn't be happier.  Oh, and did I mention that the Foie Gras here was out of this world? They give you a generous portion served with a side of delicious ripe red cherries and jam.  If there is a heaven, this dish would be on the menu. If you're a Foie Gras fan like I am, you'll enjoy this dish.  The only major complaint I have about Picasso is that they do not rotate their menu enough. I've been there twice now and pretty much ordered the same thing both times (not that I'm complaining!). It'd be nice to see something fresh though.",

    "text": "Truly a gem among Las Vegas top-tiered restaurants.  The setting and the art work are sure to WOW anyone.  But the food preparation and attention to detail were first class all the way.  I was going to take my gf to Giada's across the street, but after reading a few Yelp! reviews about Giada, and one person said it would be wiser to take your money and eat at Picasso, I decided Picasso was the place to try.  And I was right.  My gf is a vegetarian, but not vegan.  When we first were seated and shown the menus I was seriously thinking that we would have to leave.  She doesn't eat any fowl, seafood, lamb, or veal.  Explaining to our waiter, Robert, our dilemma, he asked if she would like to see the vegetarian menu.  Voila!  Problem solved, and gladly done.    If you are put off by the high prix fixe costs, then put on a brave front.  It's worth every penny.  I'd rather spend $350 on a dinner for two that is memorable, than $250 on a dinner for two that is regrettable. Forgettable.  Not worth it.  If you can understand that feeling, then visit Picasso.  We will again.  It's not an everyday restaurant, nor should it be.  It's a Michelin 2-star restaurant that should be savored.",

    "text": "Presently working in a fine dining restaurant in Boston and being a complete nerd about food, wine and beverage while making my first trip to Las Vegas was the PERFECT opportunity to finally dine at a Michelin-starred restaurant. I had done my research and French/Northern Spanish fusion seemed perfect for my tastes and my love of art especially that of Pablo Picasso only made choosing Picasso all the better. Note, this restaurant is from the evening of February 12 of this year. I have been a big slacker on writing this review, sorry! I arrived pretty much directly from the airport a bit tired but excited to begin. I was greeted politely by the maitre'd and taken to my table, which had a slight view of the Belaggio fountain that a lot of guests marvel about in their reviews. It was a little tough to see but I'll admit I didn't come for that. In terms of ambiance and decor, Picasso is on point. Aside from the art, the space was clean, properly lit and run like a ship. There was ample space between tables (admittedly it wasn't very busy at all) and the staff didn't seem to be clustered or bumping into each other (which I've noticed even at higher end establishments and always strikes me as tacky). I wish i could recall my server's name to commend his work but it's been a while. I will say he was polite, professional, and led a well-paced meal. I order a glass of Fino Sherry as an aperitif and was promptly greeted by the sommelier who handled the pouring. I went ahead with the Degustation menu and elected to change the first course for poached oysters. To begin, bread is brought out quickly and three selections were offered, I believe a olive/manchego, bacon focaccia and a more traditional french style roll. I chose two but nibbled at them cautiously as I knew I would not want to fill up before I had started any of the courses. The amuse bouche of smoked salmon, caviar and basically a creamy potato leek soup was a pleasant start. Being a wine geek and sommelier I had to go for the pairings with the tasting menu. What I really liked about Picasso is that they offered \"premium\" pairings as an optional upgrade. I couldn't help myself and I let somm Michael Schwab take the reins.First up were poached oysters in sweet vermouth with Osetra caviar. Perfectly balanced flavors and the vermouth really added a brilliant secondary component. Paired with the oysters was racy, dry Riesling. For the second course, one of my favorite things in the whole world, I had scallops. These were pleasantly plump and juicy day boat scallops with a perfect sear. Served over top of a lusciously creamy potato mousseline and a Pinot Noir reduction. This is where the wine pairings really took over: Ruinart Brut Rose AND Guigal Condrieu. I was not expecting multiple pairings at any point and talk about prestigious producers to be offering. Each pairing offered a different dimension to the scallop with the Condrieu playing off the elegant creamy textures and the Rose delivering refreshment with nuanced flavors. The third course was \"steak\" of foie gras with almonds and rhubarb gelee. The foie itself was prepared perfectly and melted in your mouth. The accompaniments with it however weren't incredibly inspired but nonetheless tasty. A rare Dagueneau Jurancon complimented the sweetness of the dish without overwhelming my palate. The main course was tournedo of Colorado lamb. Full disclosure I'm not super experienced eating lamb and only really started eating nicer cuts of lamb within the past couple of years. The dish was alright albeit tender. The trio of wines to compliment the lamb were the real star. A Burgundy (Morey St. Denis) and two Bordeauxs had me in an almost euphoric state. Talk about pick your poison. I barely had room for dessert and felt badly about it. However, I ordered the Earl Grey cheesecake which was amazingly presented and balanced in flavors. I wish I had more room at the time! I have to give my props here to service as the staff here at Picasso really made the meal and provided me with a bit of motivation in my own work across the country Boston. There were some nice subtleties that I've shared with my colleagues. I will say I think the food being simply dropped off by a food runner and not presented/\"called\" was a little dissapointing. I think in an establishment with such attention to detail and intricacies in preparation they should be pointed out or at least have the server nearby for questions to be asked. Just a bit of a recommendation as I bet plenty of people who are super interested in the cooking techniques dine here. Hats off to Picasso, Julian Serrano, Mr. Schawb and all of the staff for making for a truly memorable evening. To seal the deal a parting gift of banana muffins for the next morning were presented as I departed.",

    "text": "Before I get into the details, I'm not giving this 5 stars because: 1) on the website there is a truffle tasting menu, and that is what tipping over to choose Picasso for dining. However that menu was not available at the restaurant! They said it's a seasonal menu. That information is important, it should be included on the website. 2) Additionally, the website doesn't list prices. Perhaps it's a high end restaurant thing, but personally I find it hard to justify. 3) Finally while the food was great and two of the dishes were truly memorable, two dishes were less than great. Delicious yes, but not memorable.  They sat me inside, close to the doors that lead to the balcony next to the fountains. It was nice to watch the show as I was eating. Amazing decor and ambiance.  Phenomenal service all around. Turns out my server was French, and agreed to do the service in French (I'm French Canadian). He did a great job! I couldn't help but be amazed when I saw him dust the wine menu (which of course didn't need dusting).  I had the second selection Prix Fixe menu (@ $118). Specifically I chose the quail salad, the big eye tuna tartare, the sauteed medallions of deer, and a banana French toast for dessert. I also got the premium wine pairing option (@ $128).  Before the first course they offered me a soup of potatoes topped with almonds, and there was a croquette of fried fish (don't remember which fish though, sorry), with a tomato sauce. That thing was just spectacular.  The quail was good but was a little bland. It was paired with a really good rose champagne. Unfortunately I'm also not a big fan of champagne so I missed out a little on the first course.  The big eye tuna on the other hand was fantastic. It was paired with an Austrian wine as well as a sake. I was never a sake fan but this pairing was just perfect. Wow.  The dear was delicate and perfectly cooked but also a little bland. What stole the show with this dish was the pairing of the wine (a 2012 Bordeaux 2nd cru) with the caramelized apples. Wow.  The dessert was delicious. Not too sweet and in fact a little bitter. The bread was delicious. I'm a sucker for good bread. In particular I had this bacon and onion bread... mmmm!  Overall, incredible attention to detail. From the venue to the menu to the service, impeccable.",

Great flavor and texture.  I had the prixe fixe menu- the waiter mentioned that I could substitute the main entree with Australian Wagyu Beef for $40 additional.. so I decided to trade in my roasted pigeon for some Australian beef!

They were also attentive without being pushy or clingy. They wanted to be there and took pride in their service.  The sommelier was very nice and gave us multiple options for our wine choice. I LOVE  D our Egon Muller Riesling Kabinett!!!!   The most memorable dishes were the lamb dish and the Japanese Wagyu Filet Mignon (best beef I've ever had). All of the other courses were delectable.  PLEASE GET THE JAPANESE WAGYU FILET MIGNON - it's an additional $150 to the prix fixe menu, but it'll be worth it, because it's memorably wonderful. I never thought meat can taste that good when it doesn't involve loving sex.   I've eaten at several fancy places in LA (Providence, Melisse, Etc...) but I would rather eat at Picasso, because they cook great cuisine and give a wonderful overall dining experience.   If you want a perfect overall dining experience or if you want a memorable piece of meat in your oral orifice, GO TO PICASSO!!!!",

    "text": "I was surprisingly impressed with this restaurant! We watched a show at the bellagio and so we decided to eat here. We went with picasso bc we wanted to check out the watershow during dinner. We booked the restaurant in advance and had requested a \"window\" seat. I even reiterated it to them when they confirmed the reservations. When we get there, they didn't give us a window seat, but sat us in the middle of the dining room. They were able to let us go out onto the balcony after dinner, which was cool. But it would have been nice to get a window seat considering there were seats still open.   The actual dinner was quite good. I admit, i came into dinner not preparing to be blown away with the food. Considering all the michelin star restaurants that have disappointed as of late. The wine sommelier was great We went with halibut for our entree and went with a white wine. He helped us pick a very nice bottle of riesling to go with our dinner that wasn't too sweet, and was nice and crisp.   We went with the menu degustation. (there's only two options...a five course degustation, or a pre-fix 4 course option. there's only a $10 difference...so why not go for the degustation?) and we made the right choice. The amuse bouche was a croquet and potato leek soup. The first course was a maine lobster salad. It was quite refreshing and a great way to start. Then came the seared scallop which was also really good. wasn't particularly impressed with the bread or butter, although the butter presentation offered a nice touch. The third course - seared foie gras was amazing! It was nice and buttery and went well with the toasted sliced almonds. Very impressed. Our entree on the other hand, was just ok. I had the halibut and felt it was a little on the dry side. I had the brioche for dessert, which was really good as well. Petit fours was typical. In addition, on our way out, we received a cigar box with small blue berry muffins for breakfast the next day. It was actually quite good.  Watershow...$150 million worth of picasso paintings for your viewing pleasure...and good food. For Vegas...not bad! ;)",

    "text": "Wednesday night (10/15/14), 7:00pm.  The dining room at Picasso is decorated with Picasso's art work and opens onto a balcony that overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  If you go for dinner, you have two menu choices.  The degustation menu consists of 3 appetizers, an entree and dessert ($125) and the prix fixe menu, which includes 2 appetizers, an entree and a dessert ($115).  Each menu offers a few options to choose from in each category and also comes with a wine pairing option for additional money. The restaurant also has a great wine selection of different full and half bottles as well as wines by the glass.  We opted for the degustation menu and started off with a Sazerac ($15) and a Negroni ($15) which were strong and served straight up.  Bread service: They offer three different types of bread (French baguette was my favorite) and come around often and throughout the entire meal service (unlike other unnamed French restaurants on the strip that brag about their bread cart but you see it only once for the entire dinner).  Maine lobster salad:  The lobster was fresh and paired well with the fruit in a light vinaigrette dressing. The portion is a little on the small side but it is a great start to the meal.  Pan seared scallop: A perfectly cooked scallop on a bed of finely whipped mashed potatoes.  I would have been happy just to have more of this plate for the rest of the meal; it was that good.   Sauteed steak of Foie Gras:  What more is there to say? It was unctuous and savory and contrasted well against a sweet rhubarb jam.  It is a fantastic dish.  Roasted Colorado lamb medallion: I was afraid to order this as many places serve lamb far too rare for my taste.  The waiter told me not to worry as they will cook it exactly as I liked it and, sure enough, they did. It was medium, pink and melt in your mouth delicious.  My friend opted for the halibut filet which was moist and perfectly cooked.  Citrus bombe and Hazelnut Joconde:  The desserts seemed to be the weakest link in the dinner service.  The taste of my citrus bombe was very reminiscent of an orange cream popsicle.  While not bad tasting, it was somewhat of a let-down. The joconde cake was moist and went will with the ice cream; a better dessert than the bombe.  They also bring out the customary plate of five small mignardises.  The service from start to finish was top notch.  As a final closing touch, when you leave, they hand you small complimentary boxes of baked treats to take home.  All the way around, from taste to service to atmosphere, Picasso is a wonderful fine-dining experience. It clearly stands far above the experiences we have had at some of the other more well-known French restaurants in Vegas. It is my top choice for fine French dining on the strip.",

    "text": "We dined here last night, on a bit of whim.  We had tickets to see Cirque's \"O\" at the Bellagio, and went over to the Bellagio early to see if we could grab some dinner prior to the show in the hour and 15 minutes we had.  I had read about Picasso before we went to Vegas, with it's 2009 Michelin stars. . .  I knew I wanted to try it, but I figured you would need 1.  a reservation and 2.  more than 75 minutes.  I was wrong on both accounts.  We were immediately told we could be sat and finish prior to our 7:30pm showing of \"O\".  They also informed us we didn't need to get to the theater early since we already had our tickets, we could show up at 7:30pm on the dot and be fine ( and we were).   Okay back to Picasso. . .   We were led to our table, and it was then that I realized the Picasso not only has Picasso's all over the walls, but also overlooks the Bellagio lake and fountains!   Um, yes please!   Piccasso only has 2 set menu's, we went with the pre fixe menu that was $115, and then we also added on the wine pairings, which were all SPOT ON.     First course I got the poached oysters, and my husband got the warm quail salad, both were divine, but my oysters were life changing. . .and I normally don't like cooked oysters, I like them raw, but these were off the chain.    Second course, I got the sauteed ruby red shrimp and my husband got the foie gras. . .both were very good, the foie gras being a little bit better though.  Although I liked the lightness of the shrimp, as the foie gras was so rich (as it should be).   Third course, I got the lobster (which costs $40 extra), and my husband got the Fallow Deer. . . they were so different and both so excellent.  My lobster was fantastic and my husband loved the deer.    My dinner ended up being much lighter than my husbands, thank god.    For dessert, I got the earl grey cheesecake and my husband got the cherry tart, both were very very good, but I do think the cheesecake was the winner.      We were sent off to our show in perfect time, and they gave us a little box on our way out as a gift, inside were two chocolate chip mini muffins.  I enjoyed them for breakfast this morning.     Final verdict, this was a top 10 lifetime meal for me, I wish we had more time, and could have sat out on the patio closer to the fountains. . .ahhh, next time!   Thank you Picasso!",

The restaurant is full of rare genuine Picasso paintings and it has a wonderful view of the Bellagio water show that comes on about every half hour. The food is amazing especially if you like French food and the wine list is also quite expansive and very spendy. Definitely a restaurant where you want to celebrate a a very special occasion.  Just make sure you take lots of money with you!",

    "text": "Had dinner here as part of my bachelor party weekend in Vegas and I must say it was probably the best dining experience I have ever had. I have to give kudos to Kelly Moloney, the general manager, for getting us a lakeside table on an evening where it was difficult to obtain (I don't know how you did it, but words can't even begin to describe how awesome that was of you)   The quality of the food and service we got was top notch. It was if our server and wait staff knew what we wanted even before we did. The personal attention we received made us feel as if we were the only people in the restaurant. If I had to pick a favorite dish, it would be a tie between the Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer and the Foie Gras au Torchon.  I would highly recommend vising this fine establishment as it will be a meal that you will remember for years to come.",

    "text": "I wanted to take my boyfriend somewhere special for his birthday and since he mentioned about how he wanted to dine at Picasso .. wha-la, I made reservations for dinner the night before his birthday. When I made the reservation, I had them make a note about getting seated at a table with the view of the fountains. You can't reserve a seat by the view but they can do their best. We ended up at the third table away from the window.   The view was really nice, especially when the show came on. There were also a lot of artwork around the restaurant, which created a very calming atmosphere.  It was possibly the fanciest dinner that we've ever had in our lives thus far. Hopefully there will be more to come in the future.   Moving on... Picasso has two different menus for you to choose from -- their prix-fixe (four courses) or their chef's tasting menu (five courses) which was labeled \"Degustation.\" They also have a thick menu for their wines. My boyfriend opted for the chef's tasting menu while I had their prix-fixe with a glass of Riesling wine.   I chose the:  Poached Oysters: Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. The texture of the oyster was perfect and had a creamy sauce with it.  Sauteed Chilean Sea Bass: The warm meat with a slight crisp was definitely a wonderful combination. However, the mashed potatoes are HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY.  Roasted Veal Chop: I've never had veal before so I wasn't sure what to expect but I must say... I do not like it. The texture and consistency of the veal reminded me too much of pork chops -- just more tender. There also wasn't much taste or seasoning to it so it was probably my least favorite dish.   I also got to try a bite of the dishes that my boyfriend got. The lobster salad was very refreshing. Scallops just aren't my thing so no comment on that. Foie gras steak .. was heavy but really delicious. The lamb was DELICIOUS. If you like lamb then you oughta get it. It was so tender and full of lamb flavor.  We got to choose our dessert from their menu and I went with the earl gray cheesecake. Their desserts are the epitome of sweet. This is why people have coffee with their desserts. The slice of cheesecake was topped with earl gray ice cream. I actually wished that the cheesecake itself would have some earl gray flavor .. but it was just really sweet instead. It was good but a little too sweet for my tooth.   Dinner lasted three hours. So it's not a grab and go. It's a, \"let's enjoy our night here.\" Definitely a great place to dine at for special occasions or if you want to just treat yourself. It is a bit on the pricey side but you pay for what you get. The service is amazing and friendly even though we were a little lost ... our first time and everything. The whole experience was definitely memorable.   The only thing about Picasso was that their menu items are on a bit on the heavy side. Lots of fattyness and creamyness. My boyfriend and I were STUFFED to the bone after dinner. Not to mention my stomach was doing flip flops so I had to rush to the bathroom right after dinner. My stomach most likely did not enjoy the amount of fat and cream that was in my food.   Overall, we would definitely return for another dining experience sometime in the future.",

Not to mention you share a room with 25 Picasso art pieces and can catch a glimpse of the Bellagio water show.   My husband and I decided to go with the menu degustation and wine pairings. 5 flavorful courses. Our favorite dish was unanimously the scallop. But the lobster salad was up there. I didn't love the lamb as much as my husband but that is no fault to the chef. It was just personal taste and preference. However, it was seasoned well and cooked exactly as I asked.   I've had some great fine dining before and I give the food 4-4.5 stars. But the 5th star is the service. They come around with bread and water refills enough times without interrupting your conversation. They come back a little after you have received each course to see if you like it. The tastings may look small to some but we were very full by the end!   Nice, long dinner, with my husband and wine. My favorite thing in the world. Plan to be around for a couple of hours. Took us about 2.5 hours. So don't come with a date who doesn't say much! All around great experience.",

    "text": "***While its menu does not change frequently, Picasso features well prepared French cuisine that showcases premium ingredients more impressively than many of its fine dining competition***  I went to Picasso a long time ago and enjoyed it. Picasso is a longstanding French restaurant in the Bellagio that is known for its million-dollar paintings on the wall, its view of the Bellagio Fountains and its exquisite cuisine from Julian Serrano. While I enjoyed Picasso, I haven't been back because their menu does not change much especially their signature tasting menu, which always features a lobster salad, roasted scallop with potato mousseline, seared foie gras and mains like lamb loin.  Picasso offers a build-your-own 4-course menu, but that too is a mix of always there dishes with just a few seasonal touches. Still, I haven't been in a while so I decided to give them another shot and go the 4-course route this time. My dinner started with an amuse of delicious chilled potato and leek soup garnished with almond slices. The soup was accompanied by a crispy croquette filled with a creamy pheasant center and topped with Serrano ham. Okay bread and butter followed with choices like French baguette and olive bread.  My first course was a warm quail salad, and I loved the quail. The quail breast was juicy and tender with a very appetizing crispy skin. There was also rich quail leg stuffed with foie gras. The garnishes were quite dainty but good and included bitter frisee, crunchy pine nuts, artichokes, and a truffle vinaigrette.  My second course was a foie gras torchon. The foie gras was very creamy and buttery though lacked the strong meaty flavor of excellent foie gras. Luckily, the garnishes were top notch. The foie gras was highlighted with Harry's strawberries and jam--some of the best strawberries around with an unbelievable sweetness. There were also brioche croutons and almonds on the plate.  My main course was a full roasted squab, and it was exceptional. Squab is my favorite protein, and this is one of the best preparations I've ever had. The squab breast was red, juicy, tender, and with a great bounciness to it. The skin was thick, flavorful and crispy. The squab leg was also good and provided a duck confit-like flavor and texture. I really enjoyed the side of blanched asparagus and carrots--simply prepared but memorable. There was also a side of wild rice risotto, which was just okay. I liked how they used a light side given the other heavy items throughout their menu, but this wild rice preparation wasn't really elevated over other wild rice dishes I've had.  My dessert was a warm chocolate fondant, which was satisfying though not remarkable. The cake had a nice contrast between the cake-like exterior and the warm, liquid (but still thick) chocolate center. They used a really dark chocolate (strong bitter notes though some sweet notes too), and this resulted in a kind of dry-like experience (the dry chocolate sable base only added to the dry texture I felt on my palate). It was the kind of rich chocolate experience that would work better as a dessert accompaniment (like a sauce over profiteroles and vanilla ice cream) than the centerpiece of a dessert. This dessert was accompanied by creamy Bailey's and butterscotch ice cream with a noticeable Bailey's flavor.  The dinner ended with decent mignardises and banana chocolate chip muffins to go.  Service was excellent--polished, professional, polite, and friendly. Picasso is the type of restaurant where they know guests are spending a lot to dine there, and the whole staff goes out of their way to make the dining experience as special as possible. Prices are surprisingly reasonable given the exceptional quality Picasso achieves. Picasso is significantly less expensive than Joel Robuchon, Guy Savoy and even other less notable fine dining and steak-driven restaurants on The Strip.  I've enjoyed both of my dining experiences at Picasso, and it is a perfect fit for Vegas. Vegas is filled with establishments that do not change. Picasso somehow excels at continuing to produce the same dishes year after year without diminishing returns. If you are looking for consistency as well as the type of premium experience you expect to find in Vegas, Picasso is one of your best options.  Like most casinos on The Strip, the Bellagio offers complimentary self parking.",

    "text": "Exquisite venue that not only has an upfront, showcase view of the Bellagio fountains, but also has lots of Picasso paintings to admire within.   From start to finish, you know you're in for an exquisite experience. Picasso has its own escalator bank that leads you away from all the crowds inside the Bellagio, and as you're greeted, you'll walk through their wine display cases. Inside, there's a large, airy room with large, comfy booths and tables that provide enough privacy for groups large and small. And the artwork on the walls are subtly highlighted; while they're not the focal point of the establishment as if you were in a museum, they still provide an elegant backdrop to a lovely dinner. There's even a binder full of backgrounds behind each painting that you can ask to peruse.   Service is formal and professional, with just enough attention to make sure your needs are met, without being too intrusive. And, of course, the food was the main event. An amuse-bouche pleasingly paired a sampling cream of potato soup with a pheasant croquette, while the next course, Alaskan king crab, helped whet the appetite further. The sauteed \"A\" steak of foie gras was sinfully delightful, while a decent helping of filet mignon was prepared perfectly to order - medium well, in my case. A dessert duo provided a nice ending to a meal that was beautiful both inside and out.  Definitely worth every penny if you're up for a splurge. Also, definitely worthy of 5 Yelp stars, not to mention two Michelin stars the last time such ratings were given for Vegas. And a perfect venue for my 800th review!",

I chose this restaurant as the place where me and my new wife could celebrate our marriage with a romantic dinner - yes, it was our honeymoon.   The service was impeccable and we were always taken care of at any given time during the moment we entered through the doors. From the hostess who greeted us and asked us if we would like to sit inside or outside - outside in case you were wondering - to our waiter who escorted us through the menu choices and the wine selection. We felt completely taken care of. Lets not forget the runners/servers who constantly made sure that our water/wine glass were never empty. The experience here was truly luxurious.   Fun fact is that I did not know this was a Michelin starred restaurant - two at that. I chose this place from a coworker's recommendation. I requested the reservation from American Express Concierge.   After trying the food here, my taste buds and expectations of how food should taste were definitely propelled to another world. I was astonished how delicious, delicate, and well-seasoned everything was on our plates. Lets not forget the plating and presentation, which I am sure the name Picasso was chosen for this reason. We were worried about the amount of food being offered, but our one dinner lasted roughly three hours and we ended up completely stuffed and could not handle all of the desserts. Even after several weeks after trying this place, other restaurants have paled in comparison to this place, which doesn't seem all that fair to other restaurants, but I cannot forget the feeling and taste of when I tried the foie gras or the piece of salmon. I was always the type to love food as it fills my hunger, but never really focused on the taste as much as I did this night. However, this place really did open my eyes to what a culinary experience really entails. From the first set to the main course, it worked beautifully in harmony to deliver a well balanced experience. It is very hard to describe the food in words and all I can recommend is to try this place the next time you are in Las Vegas and you have a special occasion to dress up one night for a romantic evening.   Decor inside was truly luxurious as you would expect. Tid bit: the bathroom was cool. The outside seating was phenomenal with the Bellagio fountain constantly playing throughout the evening. If it is remotely chilly, the restaurant does have high quality heaters besides each table. It was a bit chilly on our night, but the heaters worked well and we felt as cozy as if we were inside dining.   With a beautiful scenery and a wonderful menu, the romantic dinner was a complete success. I am now thinking about questing for other Michelin starred restaurants to try so that I may really understand how far the culinary world goes.",

Since I live in NYC, I have tried many 2 and 3-star Michelin restaurants including some in Europe so I know what to expect of the food and service.   We did the five course set menu and honestly I thought the bread and Amuse-bouche was the best part of the meal. I ordered the lamb and it was just fine however my mom ordered the halibut and it was so dry that she ate only one bite. The servers didn't ask how it was and just took our plates and moved onto the next course. As a courtesy, we felt that it wasn't right to automatically say what we thought of the food so we just left it. Strike #1. After dessert, we were so full that we couldn't eat the petit fours that they gave us, so we asked if they could box it up and we could take it home. They said yes but they ended up giving me the box and expected me to package it myself, so I did, but I had to do it with my bare hands since all of the silverware was already taken. Strike #2. The only positive thing I could say of the meal was that I got to meet Julian Serrano (who was very nice and wished me a happy bday) on the way out. All in all, a disappointing experience at a 2-star Michelin restaurant.",

The location is at water level right next to the big fountain and diners can enjoy the show from inside or from their private patio. The setting is elegant and beautiful with original works by Picasso on the walls.   The menu consists of just a few options of multi course tasting menus which all looked wonderful. Our food was excellent and the wine pairing was very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the service was a little slow at times.   Regardless, I definitely go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I chose the PRE-THEATER dinner menu. It's a two course and desert menu. This does not normally come with a wine pairing , but the Sommelier put one together for our meal, it was exquisite.  Picasso is a winner of the \"Grand Award\" from Wine Spectator. The amuse bouche was a delicious a silky leek soup accompanied by a tasty truffled quail fritter and a great way to start the meal.  For first course offered Poached Oysters or a Foie Gras. My wife and I are huge fan of foie gras or poached oysters. The server instead offered the lobster salad, which was nice and light.   For our main course we selected the Halibut on top of asparagus with a Classic Hollandaise Sauce. I've never tasted Halibut sauteed so crisp on one side, moist and flakey on the other like the one I had at Picassos.   For desert we had the Warm Chocolate Fondant with Bailey's and Butterscotch Ice Cream, Chocolate Sable  Overall, a fabulous experience. We will be back.",

    "text": "So this is one of a few Michelin two star restaurants in Las Vegas. We did wait about 30 minutes past our reservation time but that's probably due to previous diners enjoying the ambiance for longer periods than Picasso expected.  The ambiance and decor were nice. The restaurant is decorated with paintings from, not surprisingly, Picasso.  Prix fixe menus are customizable and reasonable at $120-$130. Wine pairings are another $50-$90.  Service was impeccable, as required from Michelin star restaurants. The servers are always watching to make sure you have an outstanding experience. Empty plates never linger for more than a few moments on your table. Any silverware taken away is replaced by another within a few moments. Water and wine glasses are never empty. This was also my experience at, e.g., Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, etc.  If you are seated near the windowed doors (which we were), you can see the fountain show just off the balcony, and hotel lights across the Las Vegas Strip.  Portions were not large, as you would expect at a Michelin starred French restaurant.  Poached oysters were good; foie gras with jam was good; venison (deer) was good; pheasant was good; lamb shank was good; and Chilean sea bass was good.  All-in-all, a very enjoyable experience.",

    "text": "Picasso is a two Michelin star restaurant run by chef Julian Serrano located downstairs in the Bellagio Hotel with windows that overlook the gorgeous lake and fountains. The dining room is filled with millions of dollars of original art from Picasso including paintings and ceramics. There is a bar if you need to get a quick bite or don't have a reservation. You definitely want to have reservations as every table was full on Saturday night and since this is a fine dining establishment give yourself plenty of time to enjoy your meal, at least 2 hours if not more.  My husband ordered the Prix Fixe menu ($118) and I thought that the Degustation (tasting, $128) menu had fewer courses so that's what I ordered. Turned out I was wrong!  They have an extensive wine and cocktail list but we both ordered the Sommelier Wine Pairing and were not disappointed.   The bread selection was lovely and the green olive bread that I ate was delicious. I am a bread girl but tried to control myself so that I had room for everything that was to come!  From the Degustation Menu: Amuse bouche: Vichyssoise soup served with a flash fried cheese which was tasty. Maine Lobster salad Seared scallop (I was a little disappointed with this dish and felt like it lacked flavor) Warm Quail salad (they allowed me to substitute instead of the Foie Gras) Roasted Lamb Tournedo (This was the highlight of the meal and melted in my mouth!) Chocolate Fondant Petit Fours Gift: two banana muffins to take home in a lovely gift box  Prix Fixe Menu included the Amuse Bouche, Petit Fours and the boxed gift of muffins. Pea Soup Ruby Shrimp Maine Lobster Devil's Food Cake with Strawberry Cheesecake Ice Cream  The service was perfect and everything arrived in a perfectly timed procession. The servers and the sommelier were friendly and not snooty as you can sometimes find in restaurants at this price point.  The website suggests dressy attire and we dressed to impress but noted that others seemed to have just wandered into the restaurant from the casino and didn't know about the dress code.  Children over the age of 5 are welcome in the restaurant which helps ensure that the ambiance is not disturbed by cranky, tired toddlers.  I always have to check out the bathrooms in fancy restaurants and this one is super fancy with real cloth towels.  We've eaten at all of the top restaurants in Las Vegas now and will definitely return to Picasso at some time in the future. Overall the delicious food, romantic ambiance and top notch service will bring us back!",

The new GM, David Griffith, agreed to still honor the credit and was at the host stand upon our arrival.  I appreciated that he remembered me as soon as I said my name and I also really appreciated that he sat us right near the window so that we had a perfect view of the fountains.  I cannot recall the name of our server, and I wish I did, because he was amazing!!  He was funny, responsive, and made our night very special.  The food was delicious, and plenty enough to fill our bellies.  We also received desserts in beautiful boxes on our way out the door.  I am grateful that Picasso made up for their prior mistake and because they did, I will definitely recommend the restaurant to friends/family visiting Vegas and we hope to dine with Picasso again in the future.",

Best seat in the house.   Inside of the restaurant it's also very luxurious but you can find this kind of luxurious places in other places. I definitely don't think it's worth staying inside. However there is one thing that separates this luxury restaurants from others. There are real Picasso paintings in the restaurant.   The experience of sitting in front of the water fountain enjoying a Michelin 2 star restaurant was fantastic.   We ordered the five course meal. The foie gras was fantastic. Size is pretty big for it to be in a tasting menu. It is $128 per person for a tasting menu.   I feel that I would come back but only if I get seated outside.   The food it pretty good. I didn't find it to be super spectacular or anything. Still deserves 5 stars.   When you leave the restaurant they give you a muffin in a nice Picasso packaged box.",

The bartender asked me if I wanted a drink menu, or if he could come up with something on the spot. I told him my preference for bourbon, and he hit the lab. Buffalo Trace mixed with who knows what else, I was too distracted by the amazing art. On my first sip, I knew it was a winner.  I was told that patio seating was the way to go, but little did I know that I'd be getting a table that overlooks the Bellagio fountains, which went off in a spectacular show no less than six times during my meal.  Being in an ambivalent mood, I went with the taster menu and asked for a recommendation for wines aimed at the front and back half. First up was an amazing croquette that was soft and crispy, with the most amazing side of potato leek soup, chilled. It was paired with Serrano ham, and was a perfect entry point for the rest of the meal.  There was a lobster salad that, as a Mainer, I can say was as good an execution on the ingredient as I've ever seen. A beautiful scallop dish that was absolutely perfect. My entree was lamb and it, too, did not disappoint.  This was, without a doubt, one of the best meals I've ever eaten. If you're ever in the area and looking to go all-out on an unforgettable meal, Picasso is the way to go.",

    "text": "I had issue with many of the restaurant's offerings and wrote a note to 2 different employees, designated as the appropriate contacts for Picasso related issues. Neither Kelly Moloney (General Manager) or <a href=\"mailto:rworrell@bellagioresort.com\">rworrell@bellagioresort....</a> have responded.  Just wanted to share a few details  Service was excellent.  We ordered tap water but upon review today, noticed that I was charged for bottled water. Has starch been nearly eliminated from your offerings? Other than a tablespoon of potato puree that surrounded my scallop, I don't recall any other starch (except the bread and dessert).  The lobster salads were dry. The scallops were overcooked and dry. Both servings of foie gras were overcooked. What a waste of good foie gras. Both servings of halibut were overcooked ( stiff and dry) and exceedingly salty. The asparagus were also very salty.  The sommelier was very informative and accessible. His choice for pairing with the foie gras (2006 Royal Tokaji) however, was off the mark. The wine was shockingly sweet and thus, overpowering. So much so that both servings were left in their glasses.  During conversation after dinner, we learned that nobody during dinner wanted to raise issues in front of our customer.  We had an amazing dining experience when we ate at Picasso 2 years ago. So much so that our customer asked if we could return last night.  The evening would have been flawless had better attention (consistent overcooking) been applied to the preparation of our food.  $750 is an awfully large amount of money to spend on dinner for 3. Everything ought to have been perfect. Last night it wasn't. During an upcoming trip to lv, we now must give other top tier dining venues more consideration. And that's a shame, given your stellar service and location.",

The food, although good really wasn't extraordinarily, especially at its price point.  The foie gras was a bit over seared and the lobster a bit overdone as well.   I'd probably go back, but only if the casino was footing the bill.",

    "text": "My meal at Picasso was fantastic but unfortunately not flawless.  The warm and beautiful setting, complete with namesake art, was nonetheless a wonderful high-end splurge.  We took a friend's advice and ordered the wine pairings as well.  The menu followed a traditional route and started off light.  The amuse, a smoked salmon covered cucumber with quail's egg, was one perfect bite.  It was followed by a lobster salad, dressed with Champagne and apple vinaigrette with pink peppercorns.  The vinaigrette literally sparked, incredible!  The wines for all the seafood dishes were crisp whites; a dry Australian Riesling and a Pinot Gris from Alsace.  Although I enjoyed both, neither blew me away.    The menu then turned for the heavier.  Our next course was the foie gras A-steak (that was more the size of a New York strip!).  The huge, soft and buttery foie was seared on both sides and topped with crushed walnuts and almonds in a sweet port wine sauce.  The foie steak was served with a Sauternes poached pear stuffed with blackberries.  This luxurious and fatty dish was brought to life by the texture of the nuts and sweet pear    and berries.  However, the wine pairing with the foie was the low point of the meal for me.  We were served a Royal Tokaji (a Hungarian, desert-ish wine) that was heavy and syrupy sweet.  The wine may have been excellent by itself, but it was not the perfect counter-point to the foie gras that I would have loved.    The next dishes were the \"entrees\" of the night.  We chose (from several options) the lamb and the halibut.  Sadly the halibut was dry and a bit salty.  I didn't mind the seasoning, but dry fish is dry fish.  The crispy Serrano ham would have been perfect with a nice moist piece of fish... but dry, dry and dry was just too much.  We expected better.  How could a kitchen that has mastered the scallop and the lobster as perfectly as they had still overcook fish?   The lamb entree was perfect; tender and juicy, not gamey or grey at all.  Although some fat had to be trimmed away at the table, the fat kept the meat perfectly wrapped up until it was no longer needed.  The lamb's sides were great little accompaniments; both traditional (potatoes au'gratin) and unique (zucchini salad, fresh Israeli salad).  The most amazing part of this course was UNDOUBTEDLY the wine.  The lamb was paired with a Spanish 100% Mourvedre.  This wine was balanced with a dry, minerally bite, ripe fruit and subtle oak.  The most incredible quality of the wine was how the tannins exploded with each sip and made my gums tingle!  Each sip made me marvel at how perfectly the dry tannins were brought to life by the fatty soft lamb.  The wine was unlike any wine I have ever experienced.  The sommelier had more than made up for his earlier choices.                      The deserts were good, but largely forgettable (home made ice cream, caramels, chocolate cake with frills on, etc.).    Although the food was very good, the setting added to the experience in some truly awesome ways.  The Bellagio Hotel's water show was front and center because we had \"lake-side\" seats.  Absolutely incredible!  Picasso is also an art gallery that exhibits several original Picasso paintings and ceramics.  It is hard not to sense the art's inspiration on the kitchen-- the food was rustic, traditional and refined but also curvy, surreal and not all on the same level.",

The scallop and steak Foie Gras on the otherhand was superb, one of the best cooked scallop I've had.   For the price, it was definately worth it, $132 is pretty cheap, considering you are getting lobster, scallop, big piece of foie gras, lamb rack and desert. Potions were great, seating by the Bellagio fountain was great and service was excellent.  If they upped their desert I would be back for another try.",

I went with the Prix Fixe menu, starting with Warm Quail Salad, then Sauteed Ruby Red Shrimp, then the Braised Short Rib, and finishing with Concord Grape Panna Cotta.  (I also tried a few bites from my friends' meals).  The food was delicious, with good flavors and textures.  However, I never had that 'OMG-this-is-the-best-thing-I-ever-ate,' 'excuse-me-while-I-groan-in-ecstasy' moment.  Maybe it was the fact that I didn't have my favorite food-adventuring friend (my husband) with me, or maybe the dishes began to feel a little formulaic ('oh, let's add some crispy, fried bits to every dish to make the texture interesting').  The service was impeccable, however, and overall I had a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "My expectations were very high for dinner at this Michelin two-star rated restaurant.  Unfortunately, I think PIcasso suffers from the same malaise as many a Las Vegas luxury spot:  While quite good, something about the necessity of mass producing that product leaves the end result short of what you might find in a peer restaurant in New York or Chicago.  First, the space the restaurant occupies is very nice.  True to its name, several original PIcasso paintings adorn the walls.  The serene atmosphere of the dining room offers a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of the casino floor, only occasionally to be disturbed by the amazing water show of the Bellagio fountains outside.  The food, again, was very good with some particular highlights but did not rise to the level of providing a truly unique and special experience.  I had the tasting menu while my guest had the prix fixe.  The Maine Lobster Salad looked very good on the plate but was fairly pedestrian in taste.  The Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras was very good, however I did not care much for the accompanying rhubarb and roasted pistachio.  The main course of Sauteed Filet of Turbot was a solid dish, though nothing extraordinary.  Of the other dishes I tried, I thought the Roasted Maine Lobster was very good, and the Beggar's Purse filled with chocolate risotto pudding may have been the dish of the night.  The level of service is about par with other high-end Vegas eateries.  Admittedly, I was hoping for something more along the lines of the outstanding service I received from another Michelin two-star, Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.  All of this is not in any way to say that Picasso is a bad restaurant.  However, I could not help but be a little bit disappointed, and I think Picasso would more appropriately fall among the Michelin one-stars.",

Since this was our anniversary dinner, we started off with two glasses of champagne. ($24). Now, im not a champagne drinker, but it was pretty good.  They have two menu's, the \"degustation\" ($125) and the Prix Fixe ($115) I went with the prix fixe 4 course meal. my husband had the degustation which gives you five courses.  first course: butternut squash soup with marshmallow. It was so creamy and delicious, good to the last drop! second course: Sauteed ruby red shrimp with roasted zucchini, artichoke and a pepper vinaigrette. WOW! the shrimp were cooked perfectly and the pepper vinaigrette was so good i could drink it. this was one of the best shrimp appetizers i think ive ever had. third course: The roasted milk fed veal chop, served with a roasted rosemary potato. the veal was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was beyond flavorful. the potato was so good too. i clearly was so stuffed from the other food, but couldnt help but to finish every last bite.  fourth course: dessert. i went with the chocolate fondant with coconut gelato and macaroons. the chocolate was so rich and creamy. not overly sweet and paired perfectly with the coconut gelato. the macaroon was great. So was the hand selection of home made chocolates that the chef sent out for us as well.  my husbands meal went as: first course: Maine Lobster Salad with an Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette perfect balance of sweet and tanginess. had a hint of spice as well. nice and light- a perfect starter. second course: Pan Seared Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau - scallop was cooked perfectly, leaving him to want more than just one scallop. third course: Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras Roasted Almonds and Rhubarb Puree this was probably my husbands favorite course. he still cant stop talking about it. he said it was literally like he was eating a filet mignon. it was so tender and so flavorful. fourth course:Roasted Lamb with mint aioli. The lamb was a perfect medium rare, the mint aioli was nice and delicate.  fifth course: Hazelnut Joconde with Gianduia Mousse, Vanilla Frangelico Ice Cream, Chocolate Covered Hazelnuts. OMG this dessert was incredible.   Our server was great, extremely knowledgable about the menu and the beautiful artwork on the walls. very social with us.   we finished dinner and dessert with an iced cappuccino and a beautiful view of the water show. I am happy to know one of these exsists in new york and i cant wait to check that one out!",

Third course was amazing sauteed asparagus with mushrooms (my favorite out of all the courses) and the fourth course was a vegetable ragout on a cauliflower puree I believe. For desert I opted for the poached pear on an almond frangipane, while my boyfriend had the tres leches. Oh, and they bring out a wonderful little assortment of sweet bites (ours was a pomegranate truffle, a mint meringue, a berry pate de fruit, a lemon bar and a strawberry chocolate tart)  Even though it's not listed I recommend asking for a custom wine pairing to go with the vegetarian meal - they have an impressive wine list and this way you get to try a bit of everything.",

This bite was accompanied with a small cup of corn bisque with slivered almonds. It was an excellent start to whet the palate. The bisque was perfect and the almonds provided a nice crunchy contrast to the smooth texture of the bisque. As for the rest of the meal, it was pretty good.  First course was the Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette. The salad had huge pieces of lobster meat and it was accompanied with tiny four tiny balls that were made of different melons and avocado. The pink peppercorns sprinkled about the dish also provided a nice sweet explosion of taste. Excellent!  Second course was the Pan Seared Nantucket Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau. The scallop was the most perfectly cooked scallop I've ever had. It was just the right texture without being too rubbery in the middle and perfectly seared on the outside. However, couple people complained about some gritty sand in the last few bites. The potato chip provided a cool umbrella-like decoration but was nothing special otherwise. Excellent!  Third course was the Sauted Foie Gras with Rhubarb and Crushed Roasted Walnuts. I actually thought this was a really nice dish because the liver was very nice and buttery and tasted almost like a super tender cut of steak (I've never had foie gras). But I guess the girls thought the livery and fatty taste was just too much. The rhubarb provided a nice sweet, sour, and bitter taste and I loved the walnuts that added a nutty component to the dish. Excellent!  The fourth course was Roasted Aged Lamb Loin with some type of bean. This was kind of disappointing for a main dish. It was nothing special and the loin was a little bit chewy. The other main dish was halibut, which was also just decent. I didn't like how the loin sat in a soupy pool of beans. Average.  The fifth and last course was a bunch of desserts that we all kind of shared. I got the Walnut Tart with Brled Bananas, which was also just average. The other chocolate desserts were too dense and rich. Average.  The dinner ended with some small pieces of candies and chocolates which were nice. The service was also pretty good except one time when I left to use the restroom, they took my napkin, but didn't replace it. The meal was $156 a person for the five course set meal, which was overpriced compared to other fine dining restaurants I've had for that quality of food, but I guess it's Vegas so it's expected and everything is inflated. As we left, they gave us these nice boxes that had butterfly cookies inside, which was also pretty cool. All in all, a nice experience, but not the best fine dining restaurant per value I've been to.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to describe what an amazing experience I had dining here. I know Picasso is an \"oldie\" that has been around for a long time. However, they manage to keep the excellence in service and food. We had a 5:30 pm reservation since we had a 7:00 show (LOVE at the Mirage). We were escorted to their terrace in front of the fountains. It was absolutely GORGEOUS. The day and the view.  We told our waiter we were in a time crunch and needed to be outta there by 6:45pm. We both had their 4 course pre-fix menu. Started off with a glass of bubbly. I ordered the mushroom soup (AMAZING) and my fiance the poached oysters which came with a sauce and caviar. BEST OYSTER I've ever had, even better than Le Benardin's. Second course was a the Chilean sea bass(I forget what kind) and my fiance had  the FOIE Gras. Although my sea bass was a little bit overcooked, it tasted okay. Foie gras wasnt the best i've had but top quality. Third course, we ordered two glasses of wine and we had the Veal and the Deer. Both excellent as well.  Dessert was delicious. But the most amazing thing was, WE MANAGED TO HAVE AN AMAZING MEAL, in an hour and 15 minutes. They were so kind to pace the service in a way that was not rushed but also aware of our time constraints. They were kind about it. Our waiter (French guy who has been working there since 1998) was one of the best people I have ever encountered in the service industry. He even went above and beyond to take us outside and get us in the cab. I wish restaurants take note of how important service is. It makes me feel okay about spending $500 in a one hour meal,because the service and the food were that great and worth it! After visiting Picasso, Julian Serrano Tapas, and Lago; I am officially converted to his cooking.",

At first, I was really excited because I had requested a balcony table in my reservation, so I was happy that they had accommodated us (it was so beautiful to watch the Bellagio fountains during sunset),  however when walking out to the balcony area, the host in front of us didn't hold the door open and it practically closed on my face. Rude. But it didn't end there. We had decided that we wanted the filet mignon, which costs $100 or so extra. When ordering, our waitor pointed out the additional cost and straight out asked if we could pay for it. Excuse me?!  I don't know what kind of training or experience the staff has here, but I've had better service at a Dennys.  Well, at least the food was amazing.",

We had the pre-fixed menu which consisted of Poached Oysters, Warm Quail Salad, Fois Gras, Roasted Main Lobster, and Sauteed New Zealand Tai Snapper. As always, the Fois Gras was smooth & savory and the highlight of the evening.  While everything was delicious and amazing and we would recommend others to dine here, nothing was a stand out dish that's particularly memorable. I don't think we will be back for a while because there are other restaurants in Vegas we want to try. We still recommend you try this at least once!",

We got to meet the chef - Julian Serrano.  He was very sweet.  We were not seated close to the windows but our table still had a good view of the fountains.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated with flowers and plants.  We went with the prix fixe menu for $115.  I really enjoyed my quail salad, filet of black bass, and New Zealand Tai snapper.  For dessert, I had the poached pear with panna cotta and ice cream.  Upon leaving, they gave us a box with 2 mini muffins inside.  Service was friendly and attentive.

    "text": "Amazing restaurant! The service and ambiance is really unbeatable. It is rare that I come across a tasting menu that offers both delicious, perfectly married flavors and textures, along with generous/filling portions. So I was in shock when that happened here, in a 2-Michelin-starred restaurant!   Our 3-hour long dinner was one of the best dining experiences I've had so far. We never felt rushed with each course and wow, was the ambiance romantic! The place is so nice and quiet, with only the occasional booming from the fountain show. Most tables have a very good view of it from the dining room. They even offer patio/balcony seating to get an even better view!  Dinner included the following: Amuse-bouche  First course: -poached oysters with osetra caviar and sauce vermouth                        -warm quail salad with sauteed artichokes and pinenuts  Second course: -foie gras au torchon with pineapple and port reduction                               -sauteed ruby red shrimp with roasted zucchini, crispy artichoke, tomato confit, and piquillo pepper vinaigrette  Third course: -roasted (whole!) Maine lobster with sauce Americaine and salsify                          -sauteed medallions of fallow deer with caramelized green apple and zinfandel sauce  Dessert: -warm chocolate fondant with dark chocolate gelato, toasted marshmallow, and graham cracker                  -trio of meyer lemon flan with raspberry jellie, vanilla creme fraiche sorbet, and raspberry bavarois  Ended with petits fours.  Food was superb, but I wouldn't call the dishes extremely creative or original. However, they definitely were all perfectly prepared and tasted amazing. My favorites were definitely the foie gras (best foie I've had so far in my life!) and the lobster, but the entire meal was to die for! Thank you, Picasso!",

Tip: If you find that their online reservations are fully booked, don't worry. Just give them a call and schedule that way. There's usually a spot available, and even though they said places were tight, when we went there, there were many open/empty tables.",

Some photos are still on here, but the last few time I was here, chef Julian Serrano blew my mind, my parents mind, again and again.          The resto itself is classic elegant, beautiful setting with Bellagio water fountain dancing, delicious food, stunning wines, and impeccable service again and again! Wish I was with a date, but never did when I was here. Always with my parents, broski, or friends, odd right?          Just another thing that I admire and a fan of Picasso, Master Sommelier here; how many in the US now, just barely over 100, at Bellagio alone has 4 master sommelier, enough said about this resort, and at Picasso a master sommelier and 2 other sommeliers , just that. Stunning wine list and pairing, and of course, who can forget the 11 original Paolo Picasso paintings, priceless for any meals!          A few dishes (OK so more than a few) that dear to my parents and my belly:  - Pepper cold soup & salmon croquette;  - Poached Oysters Garnished with Osetra Caviar, Sauce Vermouth - 4 oysters, extremely well prepared!  - Warm Quail Salad Sauteed Artichokes, Pinenuts - classic dish!  - Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette - light and nice!  - Ragout of Seasonal Vegetables, Fresh Foie Gras and Jus de Poularde - oh heaven me!  - Ruby red shrimp - seasonal, well balanced!  - Pan Seared Sea Scallops Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau - single gigantic scallop, tasty!  - Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras Honey Muscat Poached Pears with Creme Fraiche Gastrique,Briocheand Crushed Almonds - My mom went banana on this dish every single time!  - Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer Caramelized Green Apples and Zinfandel Sauce - gaming, aromatic, must order!  - Roasted Pigeon Wild Rice Risotto - big plate, enough to share for two! Fantastic dish!  - Tournedos of Aged Lamb -  you want a red meat with a good bottle of Bordeaux, this is IT!  - Desserts, I don't even eat sweet, my parents couldn't stop praising these sweet dishes here. I, on the other hand, dessert wines list here is excellent, my kind of sweetness!           Let make it simple, this is where a MUST DINE resto for my parents on their anniversary week every years when we are in Vegas!  Overall: 5 stars For value: 5 stars For Food: 5stars For Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 5 stars For Location: Inside Bellagio hotel,  on the strip.",

The guard before the escalator told us that there's no exit downstairs even though we were going to the restaurant (I guess we looked too young?). What a horrible way to start a dinner! The hostess was nice, although we got a bad table even though the place wasn't full. We got carded even though my friend was in his thirties.   The vegetarian tasting menu was really uninspired. The portions are large per course, but nothing was outstanding and delicious. It was nice and romantic, but there are far better romantic restaurants in Vegas that are far cheaper. The desserts were pretty good though.  All in all, the experience was nice, but the service and the way we were treated definitely left something to be desired.

I was very impressed with this place...from the minute you enter you're drawn in by the beautiful view out the window of the lake/water show and the amazing  Picasso paintings on the wall. It's a lovely space and they make you feel comfortable right away.   The service was also spot on.. with my only minor complaint being that waiter didn't seem to know the desserts very well cuz when we asked for suggestions or specific he seemed to either not know or not be interested in sharing his opinons.  However, it was still a very pleasant experience and all of the staff was very attentive and never let us lack for anything.  The real star here (sorry Mr. Picasso!) is the food --- scrumptious!  We did the Degustion tasting menu and all of the dishes were delicious and prepared fabulously.  The Maine Lobster Salad was so fresh and bright -- probably the best Lobster salad I've ever had.  The scallop that followed was melt in your mouth delicious.  The only dish I found could've used some improvement was the fois gras w/the apples. I've had this  flavor combination before but found Picasso's rendition to be not quite as flavorful and as if something was amiss w/the combination. On a good note, the fois gras was cooked perfectly and seared just right and it was a generous portion as well.  I should also mention the lamb was fabulous -- juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection.   On a slight down note, the departing gift was somewhat lack luster. Generally, most restaurants of this caliber give you a small (or not so small like at Joel Robuchon!) parting gift and Picasso was no different in this respect but the cookies we received were sub-par to the food we tasted in the restaurant. They tasted stale and like they'd been sitting around for days. I'd rather they'd given us nothing as I hated for my last impression of Picasso be these stale cookies.    Overall however, I'd return in a heartbeat and can only hope that someday Mr. Serrano will open something in LA of the same caliber.",

They asked if we wanted indoor or outdoor and we opted for out. Unless it's freezing, REQUEST OUTDOORS and you won't be disappointed. I've always thought that the Bellagio Fountains we're okay when seeing them from the strip but man are they amazing when you get real front row seats! Wasn't really expecting this and it was a nice addition to the dinner experience for us.   Food was superb. Meal lasted about 3 hours or so at our leisurely pace. The wife got the $125 five course and I got the $250 five course truffle menu. Yah, we definitely splurged.   The service was impeccable. The truffle risotto came out a little too al dente  and they prepared a new plate without any hassle.   Everything was delicious. I only give 4 stars because I don't think the extra $125 was really worth it for the truffle menu. They definitely didn't skimp on the white truffle. Maybe I was just \"truffled out\" by the end of the meal. I'd stick with the five course prix fix next time around and possibly do a wine pairing. All in all, we loved it and will be back.",

    "text": "Just went there for a special occasion dinner.    Overall, I would say that it was about what I expected...not less, not more, and I say that in a positive way.  Unlike some other Vegas upscale restaurant, it was quiet, subdued, and great for a special occasion dinner.  We were seated at a small table next to the window where we had a great view of the fountain.  I had the tasting menu with wine pairing and wife had the prix fix menu.    My tasting menu was lobster salad, scallop, fois gras, and I selected lamb for the main dish.  The service was impeccable, and the food was excellent.  I do agree with some other reviews that their menu seem to stay quite....eh...stable for some time.  I think it's nice to have their signature dishes, but I would think that renewing a menu for each season is a good idea to attract repeat customers.    since the portions are quite small, I was first worried whether I might get full, but I was VERY full at the end.  They also went out of the way to change my wife's main dish to something else as she wasn't quite thrilled with her choices (as she has some food allergies).  Overall, I had a great service and food, just as I thought I would received and made for a memorable night.  Was I blown away?  No, but I've eaten at a quite few Michelin starred restaurants in many countries so I don't get blown away too easily :D",

Once you walk into the jaw dropping Bellagio, Picasso's not too far away. As soon as you walk in you'll be greeted by inspiring and regal artwork, that could probably make your jaw completely fall off if you knew its market value. These types of paintings litter the entire dining area, which is truly a reason to visit Picasso alone. It's got to be one of the worlds most expensive art galleries, all wrapped into a wonderful restaurant.   The beauty of the paintings are complemented by the sexy plating and eternal flavor of their cuisine. We dined a long time ago, but I remember having the pleasure of finishing my girlfriends unfinished plates. What a lucky guy!!!  There's not a whole lot to say about Picasso. I mean, can you describe a True Picasso in enough words to never have the need to witness one? Is the Grand Canyon describable in a short review? NO, is the answer. Witness for yourself, or the experience shall ever be unknown.",

Not only did it have excellent service and delicious food, it had a wonderful view of the strip and Bellagio's water fountain show throughout our dinner time. We ordered the pre-fixed menu designation that was really yummy. To our surprise, Picasso's sweet chef Julian Serrano made us a starter dish of a creamy white soup and fried potato whip that warmed up our taste buds to comfort and such an inviting beginning. Our next (\"first\" on menu) dish was the lobster salad that was light and refreshing....also very good! Then came the perfectly seared scallops on top of a silky mash potato bed and light gravy pool--my favorite of the series of dishes! Another next dish was the duck confit foie gra that was sinfully rich and delightful. Finally, the main dish I had was the sea bass on asparagus was very fresh and yummy. While my husband had a lamb filet that a lot of TLC noticeably in their preparation and taste--so tender. :) We ended with creative and beautifully plated desserts. The chef faves us a tray of additional dessert bite sized treats as another surprise gift to us. This French cuisine experience was wonderful for us as we celebrated 2 years of marriage. On the way out of the restaurant, the hostess handed us another gift from Picasso of muffin treats to go in lovely boxes. I would recommend this spot if you're celebrating a romantic meal and special event. Be sure to let them know upon making reservation what special event you're celebrating. :) Totally hit the spot for my husband and I--the foodie couple!",

The carrots were mealy, the red wine reduction sauce had no salt in it whatsoever, Nor did the asparagus. The tuna tartare was tasteless. Ditto for the breads. The venison was bland and had no taste. The pigeon was OK. This is simply a disgraceful performance for what pretends to be one of the best restaurants in the US if not the world. It is clear that the kitchen and the chef, who is extremely talented, has no interest in the quality of food that is being served and can take the diners in, since most patrons have no sense of food, and therefore, areeasily taken advantage of.",

The service was excellent, with the sommelier offering great info on the wines that were part of the menu pairings.  The food was very good, but not overall amazing as we hoped, though the foie gras was a highlight.   So with all that, why not 5 stars?  A few reasons:  - personally I'd like more food options. There was a tasting menu and a degustation menu only, not a Full menu.  While there were a couple of selections to be made within each, it was somewhat limiting  - with wine pairings that were only average in our view, the price tag was a substantial, even for Las Vegas, ~$260/person (including tip).    So given the high cost, and the fact that the food was not memorable, I'll go 4 stars.",

The food , the wine and the service was exemplary, but a little too rich for me (stomach was a little upset the next day). Its really a very romantic, kind of old Vegas type spot, not very glamorous and a tad bit cheesey ...do not know if Ill ever do it again but  dining with Picassos on the wall and the incredible food it was worth trying at least once.",

    "text": "Be ready to spend $500 on dinner for two, but it is worth EVERY single penny.  Everything about this dining experience was perfection and absolutely stunning! It is easily the most beautiful, romantic dinner you can take someone.  I compare my experience to how I felt right before the intermission of the Broadway's musical Wicked. I savored every second and never wanted the experience to end. The taste and intricate plating of each dish was so astoundingly thoughtful and delicious.  We enjoyed our degustation menu inside the restaurant with real Picasso painting worth $85 million dollars displaying on the walls.  For our dessert and wine, we sat outside on Bellagio's private balcony while watching the Bellagio fountain show up close. Words cannot express how incredible and gorgeous the view was.   The Degustation Menu is $123 a person with recommended wine pairing for an additional cost of $63. The sommelier did a wonderful job explaining each wine's history and how its flavors complimented our dishes. You can actual taste how intricately each wine flavor complimented with each sip and bite of each dish.  First course was a Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette. The taste was carefully crafted and beautifully plated. The lobster was so refreshing and had a light and flavorful bite. This dish was like heaven in my mouth.  We then received our amuse-bouche which was red bell pepper soup and a croquette. It was supposed to be a starter that came before our first dish, but we received it after our first course. Minor oversight from the restaurant.   Second Course Pan Seared U-10 Day Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau. The scallops were seared to perfection on a bed of potatoes.  Richer and heavier than the first course but very tasty.  Third course was Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras with roasted Peach-Thyme Pound Cake, Almonds and Riesling Peach Coulis. I never wanted this dish to end. Every bite of it was thoughtful, from the light sweetness of the poundcake to the creaminess of the foie. I savored every single bite of this dish.  Easily the best tasting Foie Gras I've had yet. Our favorite dish of the night.  Fourth course, I went with the Filet mignon and my partner chose the Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb. We both agreed that the Lamb was tastier than the Filet. All of the ingredients on the lamb dish complimented each other wonderfully. The filet was tender but was lacking some flavors and wasn't my favorite dish of the evening.  For dessert, we sat outside on the balcony and we watched the Bellagio fountains up close and under the night sky. We went with the server's recommendation of Berry Buttermilk Cake and Warm Chocolate Fondant. We liked the buttermilk cake more than the warm chocolate fondant. It was more special and tasted a bit lighter. After our dinner, they brought us out extra desserts on a silver platter compliments, of the chef.  When we left, they also gave us cookies in a gorgeous Picasso box to enjoy.  Overall, it was an amazing experience that I will never forget.  I cannot begin to put into words how happy we were with our experience and I highly recommend dining here if you are in Vegas.",

But our 5-course meal with the normal wine pairing was phenomenal. Unfortunately the lamb was horrifically salty (we all noticed it and nearly gagged), but if you were careful you could get past it (flood it with other items on the plate). Other than that, up there in the great meals I've had (again, noting I'm not a foodie).  The staff were very nice and informative, and only very slightly snobby (or perhaps disinterested - the wine guy was going through the motions for us - perhaps since we were only doing the suggested pairings and nothing crazy). Some of these places can get annoying with that - didn't feel it here.  Came out to about $250 per person.  I loved the place and will go back next time I'm in Vegas for sure.",

When they did pick up, we inquired whether they could confirm 1) if the patio would be available for our reservation tomorrow (less than 24 hours from when we are calling) and 2) if we can make sure we are able to get a patio table as that is the only reason we are considering going. Rude hostess: 1) \"I don't know\" and \"I won't know until around 5PM...no, maybe 2 PM\" \"you can call back then and figure it out...or I guess I can call you\" 2) No. No, guarantees even with a reservation. We don't care if it is a special occasion or you put in a request. Everything is first come first serve.  Way to make a potential customer feel confident about booking for a special occasion... Steer clear and go to Joel Robuchon if you want Michelin Star quality customer service and food...check out review for that place. They definitely know how to make a customer feel appreciated and the food is amazing, you won't be disappointed there!",

    "text": "Food:3 Stars  Service: 3 Stars Atmosphere: 5 Stars   To sum it up, not memorable. For a Michelin two stars restaurant, the experience was beyond underwhelming. I scheduled this dinner for a duo birthday celebration for my friend and myself. There's quite a few things that went wrong last night. I think it is pretty embarrassing for a high class world known restaurant like this. Maybe I came the wrong since chef Serrano is not personally overseeing the place last night.   I ordered the Degustation tasting menu, and my friend order the prix fixe menu. We tried each other's dishes. We agreed that most dishes were good but not amazing. We liked his signature scallop the most. Besides this dish, I also like the lobster salad and halibut. Again, those were good but forgettable.   Here's the parts where it went wrong. A friend stopped by and chatted with us in the middle of the dinner. They didn't care to ask her if she would like to order any drinks. They finally gave her some water till 30 minutes later. Then, it was the main entree of my friend's wagyu short rib. I honestly don't know how it's called wagyu. The meat wasn't even as tender as it should be but the problem was the seasoning. It was like someone added an extra bag of salt to piss the chef off. We asked to send it back, and got another one without sauce. The manager came out and apologize. I appreciated that she personally brought the second dish out. However, it was still so salty without the sauce. We came to the realization that it was in the marinade. We sent it back and swapped to the lobster. Honestly, I personally think it was quite embarrassing for the restaurant if I had to send back the dish twice. Not to mention, this is a Michelin two stars place. The lobster that was replaced was much better.   Since we were celebrating the birthdays, I was disappointed that our server didn't offer to take any pictures for us till we asked. Then, where the service fell short was that a friend of mine knew the time and place when we had dinner sent the birthday cake for the restaurant to bring out for us. At first, I thought it was from the restaurant to compensate for the short rib since the server did not say anything. We were like oh that's a nice gesture till I soon found out it was from my friend. So basically, the restaurant almost took credits for the cake by not saying anything. I was speechless at this point.   The atmosphere was great as most of the restaurants in front of the fountain. I appreciated the paintings as well. It's a really nice place to come for a celebration if you are not a food snob.   Like other yelper had mentioned, I will return to Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon for French dining in Vegas. Not anytime soon for a place with underwhelming services and food.",

So why not 5 stars? I ordered the degustation menu along with the wine pairing, my boyfriend ordered the seasonal truffle menu - my dinner was amazing, every single dish, the star bring the foie Gras , wine pairing spot on - my boyfriends dinner on the other hand, was just ok- I love truffles and had high expectations for his dishes but it was just ok. No dish on his dinner was memorable, and by the way they give you lots of truffles so definitely it wasn't that.  Dessert and double espresso to finish my meal - perfection!  Would I come back? Not any time soon but I do recommend for a special ocasion, sit by the window and enjoy the Bellagio fountains- great experience",

    "text": "I was at a loss as to how this restaurant earned a single Michelin star (let alone the two that it currently has) almost from the moment we sat down.   The food was... sub par. From extremely over salted proteins, to odd choices of texture, I wasn't able to finish a single dish I was served, and gave up at the dessert course and passed. My companions got dessert and all three were again disappointed with the taste. My fish was served with the juices running all over the plate- it was a mess. My wife's lobster was served with curry- and not very good curry at that. We were all taken aback at the lack of skill, creativity, and general quality that we have experienced at other  Michelin starred restaurants.   The service was abysmal- our waiter was barely around and I had to ask three people for him at one point, and it still took 10 minutes for him to appear.   Was it a nice restaurant? Sure. Was the ambience awesome? Definitely. But a Michelin star? Not even close- it's literally the worst restaurant and food I've eaten at the Bellagio. Do yourself a favor and eat at Michael Mina or Harvest instead- or better yet, leave the Strip altogether.",

    "text": "Wow I'm so disappointed by my experience here tonight that I'm a little speechless.  We came here to celebrate my husband and my sister's joint birthday and while the food was ok, the experience was not.  When we arrived, they asked us if we had any deadlines, and we said we had a 9:30pm show.  Granted, one of the members of our party was extremely late, but he still arrived 2 hours before the show which should have been enough time.  Pacing could have been handled MUCH better.  After our friend arrived I had to make eye contact several times for them to take our order.  And despite them knowing that we had to leave for a show and despite them assuring us that we would be done at 9:15 in time for our show, we still had our main course on our table past 9 and we basically had to leave mid way through our meal.  We had to leave our friends to settle the bill because we were so rushed, and the two people whose birthday it was basically left without any kind of celebration moment, which ruined the mood for the evening.  At that point, I would have hoped the restaurant would have sent a couple pieces of dessert home with our friends for the birthday guests, considering they didn't get any dessert.  No such luck.   While they did pack us with dessert, it was only what was left over from what our friends had literally picked through, fork marks included.  I know some of this was partly our fault - we should have kept a closer eye on the time to rush the staff more, but I also felt at this type of establishment I shouldn't have needed to do that.   On top of that, their attention to feedback was lacking.  We'd informed our staff that one member did not like seafood, yet when he received his Jamon iberico de bellota ($35 supplement) it came with fish roe.  Bottom line - if you choose to come here, make sure you don't have any time sensitive events.  After this experience it's doubtful I'll want to come back.  There are far better options in Las Vegas for the price point for taste AND service.  Update : My sister was so upset about the experience as well that she called the manager to express her disappointment.  In stark contrast to the amazing experience we had at Bazaar Meats (an establishment that knows how to treat their customers right), the response we got from the manager was - well, if you want, you can come back and we'll get you some dessert.  No thank you.",

Service is great, and Robert is especially accommodating. We had a pre-theater prix fixe menu before going to see \"O\". It's 3 courses for $75. I had foie gras, striped bass with ratatouille, and apple pie. We also got an amuse bouche of asparagus soup before the appetizer. The plating is beautiful and food is very well prepared. Definitely a place for special occasions and a great experience overall.",

    "text": "I always make reservations at one fine dining restaurant for every trip my husband and I take together. During our most recent trip to Vegas, I chose Picasso, and it turned out to be a great choice.  There was more than one tasting menu to choose from, so my husband and I each chose a different one so we can spread out our options. My husband ordered the Poached Oysters, Tuna Tartare, and Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer off of the Prix Fixe menu (4 courses). All three dishes were delicious, especially the poached oysters topped with caviar.   I ordered the Menu Degustation (5 courses), which came with Maine Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras, and Sauteed Filet of Halibut. My favorite dish of the night was the foie gras--so rich and fatty, and the mandarin confit paired so nicely with it! Unfortunately, the halibut was the least interesting dish of the night and it was actually quite dry.  For dessert, we had the Chocolate Bread Pudding and Banded Angel Food Cake. Both desserts were plated beautifully, and I loved the combination of the flavors and textures in each one.  The dinner ended with chocolates and sweets, but we were so full we couldn't take another bite. The staff ended up packing that up for us and added additional sweets to the box. Upon leaving the restaurant, we were also each given a box of muffins.  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The staff was quick to refill our drinks and bring out each course. It seemed a little too quick, because I felt rushed throughout the entire dinner. But to be fair, we were 15 minutes late for our reservation and the kitchen was technically closed by the time we got there. I definitely recommend dining here for a special night, and try to get a seat next to the window so you can watch the fountain water show as you are eating.",

    "text": "What a wonderful experience! This review is long overdue! The Mr and I rarely  go to Vegas but when we do we usually dine at Le Cirque, this time I decided to break with tradition and give Picasso a try. It did not disappoint! The restaurant is a tad bit hard to find, but it's across the way from Chanel boutique down the escalators for those who are more familiar with \"landmarks\" than actual directions such as yours truly. :-p   See if you can sit by the windows, because the restaurant is situated by the famous Bellagio fountains so you're sitting in the front row during dinner. You will find Picasso art pieces around the restaurant- some you will recognize - some you may not.   It's a pre-fixe menu so it will change periodically, I don't believe I saw an a la carte menu. So I don't recommend this place if you are not really adventurous, or is deathly allergic to certain things where the chef would have to make so many changes to the dish that it would jeopardize the integrity of the dish and therefore your overall experience. I have attached photos for your enjoyment with a brief description should you come across the same dishes when you dine there. Cheers!",

    "text": "WOW!!! Picasso is soo amazing! Beautiful art of Picasso on the walls as well as beautiful food art on our plates. This was truly an unforgettable dining experience from beginning to end.   BF and I had reservations for 6:30 pm since we had tickets for 9 pm to watch Le Reve at The Wynn afterwards. I had requested to sit in the patio but due to the rain with the seats being all wet, they had to close the outdoor experience to us. Aww...such a disappointment on that part. That would have been a BIG bonus. We were seated right away, but too far from the window to watch the water show. Boo! The lady at the front said it takes 3 months in advance to request patio seating but the girl over the phone told me it's first come first serve...hmm, well which one is it? Inquiring minds want to know!  But on with food! We chose the Prix-Fixe menu. It's a four course menu. Funny, they don't put the prices down on the menu though but just know that it means you better have lots of money! Or plan on washing dishes for days! Although, you get what you pay for, worth every penny!  There are lots of different items choose from. While we waited, they kindly served us bread, three to choose from. French bread, raisin bread, and olive bread and Picasso butter to go with it. We chose one of each! Served warm and fresh.   For starters, I had the Poached Oysters and it had caviar. First time having it. It was wonderful! BF had Warm Quail salad, it was crispy and tender. Very good! I had the Big Eye Tuna Tartare which was good. Haha I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting some fried Wontons to go with it though but I guess the chef didn't think it needed it.   BF had the Foie Gras. You bite into it and it's like butter! Seriously, that's how the texture is...like butta baby! If that's what you like. Foie gras is supposed to be a delectable food meaning \"fatty liver\" of a duck. It was quite interesting. But it was good!   Main course...I ordered the Roasted Milk-Fed Veal Chop, BF ordered the Roasted Maine Lobster. Funny thing, we both disliked our own dish and favored the other so we of course traded! Like we always do. Next time we should just order for each other. I guess he expected something different from the lobster. I love seafood! I just don't like paying an extra $30 for it, and since he doesn't mind, then I don't feel bad for eating it if he doesn't like it! Haha works both ways and it doesn't end up a waste! He preferred my baby calf. It was too gamey for me, I guess. And I love meat! This was my second time trying veal. First time I had it on a cruise, and I immediately threw it up. I'm done! No more chances. Veal is on my banned list. BF loved it though. He said it was soo good! Good! I'm glad! Cuz I didn't like it!   For dessert, we had our own Banana French Toast. Glad we didn't share it and glad we didn't pick two different things so we can taste the other options because it was out of this world! The flavors all mixed together just exploded in my mouth! So many different bursts of flavors! Tasted like the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich ever! It was sweet goodness! Omg, we both enjoyed this dessert soo much! Nice way to end the meal.   Walking out, they gave us a little favor to take home with us, a little Picasso box with mini chocolate chip muffins. And the hostess was nice enough to take our picture in front of Picasso's painting.  Great customer service! The waiter always refilled my water. They were all very friendly and always smiling.  This was the most fun and romantic two hour meal, with a very nice ambience, the most expensive but well worth meal we've ever had. Like I said, it would have been even more amazing watching the water show, but hopefully next time.   This whole short weekend getaway was super super fun and an unforgettable memory that I will never ever forget. Thanks to my BF for an incredibly, mind-blowing, jaw dropping experience! Loved it!",

Dining is pretty straight forward: select between 3/4/5 prixe fixe menu.

My husband and I even walked around the restaurant a bit to take in some of the artwork. Beautiful pieces! Also, when the Bellagio fountains come on, the room becomes truly magical and inviting.  The service is superior, as what you would expect when dining at a AAA diamond rated restaurant. Our waiter and his team were very prompt, accommodating and pleasant.   The food was delicious. My husband and I opted for the the standard tasting menu, which is 4 courses and $115 per person. We both chose the poached oysters with black caviar for our first course, which was simply divine. The sauce that the oysters had were a tasty accompaniment. For the second course, we both ordered foie gras. It was served over a toasted, jam topped bread. OH MY GOODNESS. I love all foie gras, but the cold spreadable kind is by far my favorite. I devoured every bit of it. For my main course, I ordered the wagyu beef. It was tender, juicy and flavorful. Dessert we decided on the hazelnut cake and the poached pear. Hazelnut cake was good, but the poached pear was fantastic. It was light, not too sweet and was a great ending to our evening. For cocktails, I highly recommend the Blueberry Pomegranate fizz vodka. Superb!   When we were leaving, we were gifted a box of banana bread for the following morning. What a nice touch!  Overall... 5 stars, highly recommend for a memorable night out with your special someone.",

Then on to a lobster salad and fois gras which were amazing. Had the lamb for dinner and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the sea bass and it had the most amazing crisp to the outside of it. Everything was cooked exceptionally. Drinks were delicious and the staff was very attentive and friendly. Loved the fact that the restaurant has 11 pieces of authentic Picasso art spread around. The view from inside the restaurant is at water level and you can watch the fountain show at the Bellagio while eating. Great view. I would highly recommend this restaurant, expensive but the food is worth every penny. You will not leave dissatisfied.",

    "text": "Picasso is such an elegant and romantic restaurant to dine at.  If you are able to sit close to a window, you will get a good view of Bellagio's water show!  The restaurant is not super big, so making a reservation in advance is probably a good idea.  We had a reservation for 8pm and told our waiter that we had a 10pm show in the hotel just so he would be able to get us out of there in enough time.    Along with the fancy service we received here, we started the night with a bottle of one of their finest Chardonnay's, which the sommelier highly recommended.  The wine was served at just the right temperature, so I figured Picasso would continue to impress us as the night progressed.  My first course selection was the Maine Lobster Salad, which was a light and refreshing salad.  It was a good option; however, not even a month later and I really can't remember anything else about it.  My second course consisted of a Chilean Sea Bass with Asparagus and Hollandaise sauce.  The sea bass was sauteed with an incredible seasoning, but what I loved most about this dish was the beautiful plating.  I really enjoyed this meal.  For dessert, I ordered a chocolate mousse/tart type of thing that I didn't care for.  Overall, I had a great time at Picasso.  I would definitely come back here again to try some of the other options on the menu.  It was a great fine dining experience.",

Flavors were strong but balanced - they play a lot with tartness, but never too much so. Service was attentive and interior decor is most certainly up to par. An suggestion would be to offer little stools for purses, like they do at Wing Lei at the Wynn.",

I had the degustation while hubby had the truffle tasting. started with a light crab salad, then a perfectly seared scallop. Next was a rich foie gras with crispy almond slivers followed by a perfectly medium rare wagyu beef. Hubby's came with filet (not wagyu) which was topped with truffle. My wagyu was rich and buttery while his filet had a bolder meaty flavor, to each their own. Don't forget their coffee which is an excellent finish to the meal along with their beautifully artistic desserts. Wines pair well with meals. Oh, and then there's the take home box.",

It was a little hard to find in the basement of the Bellagio but we did manage to stumble upon the steps leading down to it.    Cocktails came highly recommended and they were very good.  Had a Cosmo and Picasso Pom - both incredibly smooth.   Starters included a delicious potato soup, lobster salad, and foie gras.  The mains we sit and they were a halibut on asparagus and a lamb based dish.   The wine pairing was very good.     For the desert we had a lava cake and a hazelnut mousse.  Both were artistically displayed but were merely ok.  My own lava cake is better though I would lose points for artsy display.    Atmosphere was quiet and romantic  That meant it was also dark and hard to read the menu.   Service was excellent throughout the 4 hour meal.    View was nice but they left the heaters in front of the windows blocking the views.  Can't believe that no one ever complained about that before.    Overall experience, excellent.",

Chicken croqueta with a tomato based soup: It was a good sample of Julian Serrano's tapas restaurant in Aria.  Main Lobster Salad with an Apple Champagne Vinaigrette: It was good.  Pan Seared Scallop: one of the better scallop dishes I've had. The crispy outside soaked up some flavor that made the dish.  Foie Gras: Not the way I prefer it, but was alright.  Turbot with Asparagus in Hollandaise sauce: It was very plain.  Quince (fruit similar to an apple and a pear): the sorbet and drink were the better variations.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.anitaeat.com&s=14efe95c768295c052c5ff4eddff6e4d46bf1ac720e22cab1ca53e8f3aec1c76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">anitaeat.com</a>",

The polite manner they congratulated on my birthday (it was still a couple of days away but since my friends were going to leave before that they decided why not). But what really made this place special was the perfectly balanced taste of the foie gras I had as part of the meal. I had almost the same dish at another place a couple of days earlier but its not even comparable. It was a pleasurable experience surrounded by works of art created by some European painter who can hardly paint. But who cares about the paintings/potteries when you're there for food.  PS. They claim its the 3rd largest collection after Paris & Barcelona.",

As someone who works in the industry (I'm a General Manager and my husband a chef) we were beyond disappointed with our meals.   We have dined in Paris at  1-2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurant and wondered how this would stack up. It did not. I can pick restaurants in the US that are far more deserving of stars than this place.  However the food was average, but the service was horrifying! We had a terrible waiter but I must say the back waiter \"Jesus\" made our experience a lot better. I hope he gets promoted to waiter soon.  Things you wouldn't expect from a place of Michelin Stars:  1. Ladies chair not being pulled out 2. Wrinkled table linens 3. Butter dish not being refilled with extra bread. 4. Entree being served to the wrong person. 5. The table behind us got an amuse bouche when they were on dessert! 6. Little to no seasoning on the potato and leek soup. 7. When the waiter brought us the bill he had a bic pen inside (now I know what your thinking, how snobby is this chick- but seriously people that can loose you a star) 8.  Waiter forgetting your cocktail order and then me having to cancel it when we got to the dessert coarse.  9. The wine binder had ripped pages in it that kept falling onto the floor.  10. The service was so rushed!!! If I am paying over three hundred dollars for a meal- then I own that table for at least 2 hours! 11. The waiters looked panicked and one almost hit me with a tray of food as I was walking to the ladies room.   I think this is enough said. People who gave this place an excellent review should think about traveling to better places before reviewing.",

    "text": "I don't eat French food very often, so not much of an expert on that.  The food overall was good.  Their menu is simple, you either go with the Prix Fixe ($113 - 4 course) or the Menu Degustation ($123 - 5 course).  The also give you a complimentary course of soup+appetizer at the beginning, and some chocolate/cookie on a little tower at the end (which was actually pretty bad... most of the stuff i had a bite and didn't even want to eat it).  The Prix Fixe have more option for each course that you can pick from.  Menu Degustation you only have a choice between two options for the main course only.  My fiance has the Menu Degustation: ( I of course had to have a taste of everything) =) My favorite was the Pan Seared Scallop.  It's just 1 big piece of scallop, but it was done perfectly. Maine Lobster Salad was good, but wasn't memorable to me. Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras, my fianced liked it quite a bit.  It tasted like a warm piece of fatty meat that melt in your mouth.  If you like that feeling, then you'll like it.  I am not a big fan of the feeling of a piece of fat melting in your mouth. My fiance picked the Loin of Lamb Roti as his main course.  I'm not a big fan of lamb, but it was pretty good. I had the Prix Fixe Menu:  I picked the Poached Oysters as my first course, since I love raw Oysters.  I ate it at first without putting in the lemon, and it was very fishy.  (I often do that with other raw oysters I eat and don't usually have this issue).  But after I put in the lemon, then it was ok. 2nd course for me was Foie Gras au Torchon.  The foie Gras was served chilled, how I usually like it as.  It came with sides of pear and persimmon that's pretty sweet. My main course I picked the Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer.  It was VERY GOOD.  I orderd it medium, and it was good perfectly.  Very juicy.  The only thing is, I would recommend not trying to finish the sides that it came with (sweet peas and glazed pear, etc), because at the end I was left with a feeling of \"too sweet\" because of that. Both came with a choice of dessert from their dessert menu.  Their dessert was ok, not memorable.  Chaya in LA definitely have better dessert.  Service was as expected for a high end restaurant like this.  Although the people who brought out our dishes kept getting confused which one was mine and which one was my fiance, when the main waiter saw that, he corrected it right away (although he was pretty busy most of the time).  We did have to ask for bread a few times while we wait for our food (there a big gap in time between each course, took us over 2 hours to eat and it's not because we eat slow).  In conclusion.  I highly recommend the Pan Seared Scallop, and venison.  Is the food worth the price?  I would say you're definitely not just paying for the food, you're also paying for the atmosphere, their large fresh flowers centerpiece in the middle of the restaurant, and all the Picasso painting they have on the wall.  By the way, Picasso is listed as a Five Diamond restaurant  on the AAA rating (there are only 52 of those in U.S.)",

The quail salad was amazing, the veal chop was great. The biggest let down was the service... The bread was offered only once in the beginning of the meal, and that was 10 min after we were seated...the server never offered more . I had to ask for butter, he brought one small plate for the party of 4, and then as an afterthought brought another. The main server rattled off the dishes without explaining too much- he never came by during the course of the meal to see if we needed anything or to ask how we are doing. The plate with quail bones was not cleared of the table and just stayed there until I asked to remove it. Then the server just handed us the desert menu without explaining much and disappeared.. I had to chase him down to ask about deserts. Overall we felt like being a part of the conveyer belt- which is not what I would expect from such a classy place!",

    "text": "The BF and I decided to bring his younger brother here to celebrate his 26th birthday. I had eaten here a few years ago and I was hopeful that Picasso would be as good as I remembered. I was thrilled that it was every bit as good as I remembered.   Since we were in a festive mood, we ordered the Menu Degustation. They also offered a wine pairing and I must admit that every wine paired perfectly with each dish. This should really not come as a surprise given that Picasso boasts an impressive wine menu.   Our meal consisted of:  * An amuse bouche of seasonal soup  * Maine Lobster Salad with Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette -- the flavors complemented, but did not overpower, the delicate lobster  * Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau -- the scallops were perfectly cooked  * Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras with Roasted Peaches, Vanilla, Muscat and Crushed Almonds -- the crushed almonds make this dish because they provide a contrasting texture; I actually preferred the taste of this foie gras dish to the one at Restaurant Guy Savoy at Caesars, but that one wins for unique foie gras presentation (see my Yelp of Restaurant Guy Savoy Las Vegas for more detail on that fab meal)  * Roast Lamb -- the meat was perfectly prepared. They decided to serve a fairly tall piece of lamb on its end for dramatic effect. The server tilted my BF's plate before he set it down and the lamb nearly slid off the plate. I made a joke about it trying to run away and the staff went with the humor.  * We added the cheese plate and they brought a nice selection * The desserts were wonderful and this place employs a talented pastry chef. The server caught my reference during dinner that we had a birthday at the table and they had written Happy Birthday in insanely beautiful script in chocolate on the birthday boy's plate with his opera cake. The BF had the apple beggar's purse with calvados and it was lovely. I opted for the molten chocolate cake on our server's recommendation (even though I am SO over molten chocolate cake) and I must admit it was delightful. The center was like a molten truffle. It came with boysenberry ice cream and some poor soul in the kitchen was so kind as to separate out individual segments of fresh boysenberries to adorn my plate.  * The post dinner truffles and other tiny bites were very good, but no match for the treat cart at Restaurant Guy Savoy.  The atmosphere of this place is utterly beautiful. Be sure to walk around the room and take in all the original Picasso masterpieces. The fresh flowers are gorgeous, especially the display on the large table in the main dining room.   It's also a hoot to watch the Bellagio fountains spewing outside the restaurant's windows every 15 minutes. Before you leave, step outside on the lakeside patio and catch the fountain show from this vantage point. You really get a sense of how high that water flies into the air.   Picasso remains a Las Vegas fine dining delight.",

I must warn you that it will raise your standards for what food should taste like, and you'll probably never enjoy the food you used to eat as much.  At least, that's what happened to me. The room was amazingly romantic. The fountain light show could be seen through the floor to ceiling windows every 15-20 minutes. Picasso's original paintings were on the walls, and a huge collection of fragrant fresh flowers  were in the middle of the candlelit room.  Service was perfect. They treat their guests like royalty.  Be prepared to spend at least  $250 for two. You won't regret it. If I was destitute, I would save up for a year to eat here once than to eat several times any place else.",

    "text": "Really wanted this place to be great, but it just wasnt.    After checking out the various new Vegas options, my wife and I made our reservations at Picasso.   We arrived, and did have a great table against the window, with a view of the fountains.   We enjoyed the physical atmosphere, and yes, the paintings are nice, but that was all that got this place the second star.   As far as the dining experience, it was rushed and unprofessional, with scattered presentation and even more scattered service.  We ordered two tasting menus with wine pairings, and were looking forward to a relaxed evening.  It was not meant to be.  The plates came out one right after the other; I could not believe I was being rushed through a $600 meal...    Half way through I mentioned it to the server, and he offered to let us have desert on the patio.  I dont know if that was supposed to actually make up for it, because it did not really  sound like a great idea to get wet from the fountain blowback.      The sommelier was literally dripping with sweat, and when I asked him about one of the wines, he pounded out his note card version of his thoughts and ran to another table.  Needless to say, not that relaxing, and not worth the cash.      The food, you are wondering?   Average.  Seriously, I have have been to plenty of fancy restaurants, and this did not make the short list of good ones.     We were looking for something remarkable, and if you are too, look elsewhere.  (I was going to give 2 stars, but by the time I got to the end, I was irritated all over again, hence the 1)",

For $115, the meal would have been a great deal - 4 poached oysters with caviar (probably worth $25), a generous portion of foie gras (it's called a steak foie gras because it really looks like a 5oz steak - probably with $30), veal (probably worth $50) and a decadent warm lava chocolate cake dessert (probably worth another $10). Later in the meal though, I realized that it was a $150 meal so then the price was actually a little on the higher end.   My husband and I look very young which I think is part of why we always get subpar service, but when my husband's \"medium rare\" steak came out medium well, they were quick at accommodating the change. It was especially loud and busy that night too, but the (partial) view of the fountains help set a very intimate mood.",

We looked into eating here months prior to staying at The Bellagio, and therefore budgeted on the meal probably being close to $500.  From walking into Picasso we could tell we were in for an amazing experience. We were welcomed by numerous staff, the ambiance was fantastic with fresh flowers, and I will go ahead and mention that we were seated right by the window which made dinner spectacular because we were able to watch the fountain show and to see all the lights on the strip.  My husband and I choose the gustation menu along with the wine pairing. I debated choosing the wine pairing, but am so glad that I did because I was able to taste/ experience the finest pairings. The starter (lobster salad) was fantastic. Next, and my favorite, was the scallops with a wine pairing from Budapest which was amazing! For my main course I choose the snapper (which I've never had before), and it along with the wine pairing from Sicily was again amazing!  We thought being a French restaurant the portions might be small, but by the time desert came we were actually very content.  The staff was great, they poured my husband and I more wine if one of us drank it all prior to eating the certain course. I was a little iffy about the foie gras and only took a couple bites (first time trying it), ended up giving it to my husband, and afterwards the waiter informed me he could had supplemented something else which I thought was nice and good to know for next time.  Desert was amazing, yes the bill was extremely pricey, but it was definitely a dining experience and one I will always remember. Great job Picasso!",

The atmosphere which included artwork by Picasso and views of the Bellagio fountains, the service which was exquisite and the food which was full of flavor and creativity made this a very memorable dinner.  The staff at Picasso really understand how to provide great service and they delivered on all of our questions and requests during dinner.  We ordered the 5 course tasting menu which included a lobster salad (fresh lobster with a light yet flavorful dressing), scallop in a potato puree (the scallop melted in your mouth), fois gras (served with a brilliant sauce that brought out the flavor of the fois gras), lamb chop (perfectly cooked and seasoned with vegetables and a light sauce), and dessert where we had the chocolate lava cake and the peanut butter mousse.  All courses were reasonable in size and at the conclusion of each made you anxious for the next course.  The wine list was robust but not overwhelming.  We ordered a bottle of 2007 Cabernet which was silky smooth and complimented our meal.  We took the sommolier's  advice for port pairings with our dessert.  We ordered two different ports and they actually gave us a taste of each other's port so we could drink and taste the differences.  We would highly recommend a visit to Picasso.  It was the total experience in a relaxed yet scenic setting at the Bellagio hotel.",

We chose the Prix Fixe menu that included the Lobster Salad, Pan Seared Scallop, Foie Gras, Colorado Lamb - all delicious - I could have had an entire plate of the Scallop and Foie Gras for dinner - they were that good.  Not only was the food fantastic - but the service was 5 star.  Our captain Roger was such a  knowledgeable professional.  He took us thru every wine pairing - explaining what accents/notes/flavors we should be looking for in the food and the wine.  Speaking of wine - Robert - the sommelier - was outstanding.  Helping us pair wines with the prix fixe - that were outside of the wine pairing option.  Everyone of his picks hit it out of the park.  All I can say is \"fantastico!\" - when back in Vegas - I'm coming back to Picasso.  My wife and I thank you for such a memorable night !",

I would argue this is one of the most romantic locations in Las Vegas, and when combined with such a high-class dining experience, it makes for an uber-romantic experience.  The food was really well prepared and delicious, but sorry to be \"that guy\"...I've certainly had better.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing stood out to blow my mind either.  We did the larger tasting menu (5 courses), and I had lobster salad (4 stars), seared scallop (4 stars, although it was a little over), foie gras (2 stars, but I'm not a foie person and I appreciated the toasted almonds for texture), lamb (3 stars) and pineapple nougat dessert (4 stars).  The amuse bouche was a quail (I think) croquette and a shot of a cream soup, and that was particularly delicious, 5 stars!  I also ordered the wine pairing, and the wines were well-selected, delicious and interesting.  Service was impeccable and very high class.  Definitely worth a visit!",

The restaurant itself is nestled on the ground floor in the Bellagio hotel near the shops.  The atmosphere was very cozy and warm with an \"Old World\" feel.  Real Picasso paintings flank the entire restaurant, which was quite impressive.  We were seated  at the bar first, and proceeded to order a glass of bubbly, which was kindly suggested by the bartender.  it was light and crisp and set the mood for a celebratory evening.  after about 10 minutes, we were seated by the window, where you can see the bellagio water show.   ask in advance for window seats, you won't regret it!.  The waiters and staff were all very cordial and friendly.  I ordered the prix fixe menu, which offered five courses, including dessert.   first course: main lobster salad - the lobster was plump and absolutely delicious! second course:pan seared U-10 day boat scallops - the scallops were seared to perfection. they had a crisp exterior and upon cutting it with my fork, it was so smooth and buttery. mmmmmm third course: sauteed \"A\" foie gras - smooth and savory! foie gras can be very rich, but with how it was prepared, it was velvety heaven! fourth course:filet of turbot- tender flaky filet with a smooth and creamy hollandaise that makes your mouth water. fifth course:roasted lamb chops-i love lamb and picasso did not disappoint! it was absolutely amazing! The meat was so tender and the aroma was mild and the meat literally fell off the bone.  AMBROSIA!  Dessert was phenomenal as well...highly recommnded!",

I couldn't imagine anyone with culinary experience over cooking foie gras to this extent!!!  It's as if the chef forgot it on the stove, then said \"oh well, we're too busy to remake it\".  For the first time in my life, I returned the dish to the kitchen. Our waiter totally agreed that it is burnt foie gras... (burnt so bad it was hard). 10 minutes later, he returned with another plate of foie gras, still burnt, but not as bad, it was COLD and RAW in the middle. It ruined my night. I can pan sear a foie gras myself (it's not that hard). We couldn't eat this horrible dish, therefore one less plate in our set menu.  The waiter did not deduct it off our bill either.

From the decor (authentic Picassos hanging on the walls), to the beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains, not to mention the exceptionally decadent cuisine and impeccable service, I had a wonderful experience here. My then bf and I did the prix fixe menu and I started with the oysters with caviar. All I can say is that oysters are officially ruined for me. There is no way I could possibly eat them anywhere else now. Simply delicious and fresh! Then it was the lobster roll. This course was alright but still savory. Then came the swordfish, by this point I was full, actually full and my bf finished it for me. It was a hearty steak, prepared beautifully and as melt in your mouth as one can get this meaty fish to be. Finally the dessert. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.my&s=98edab0cb2c458afb9b59a25bbadcf0054149a3363212accbb9e496ac87121c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.my</a>.gawd. It was a farm scene, no lie, an actual farm scene, fashioned with lil, completely edible, items you'd see on a farm. A burlap bag filled with spiced apples, a ram with cookie horns, it was whimsical, delightful and it all ended up in my belly. I only wish I was obnoxious enough to take pics but I just couldn't in a Michelin rated restaurant, I just couldn't. The service was perfect and our server chuckled in a completely friendly way when he caught me playing with my dessert ram. It was refreshing to see that Picasso was upscale without being pretentious and stuffy. I'm not a wealthy person and experiences like this are ones to be immortalized forever. Thank you Picasso for delivering as perfect of a restaurant experience as one could possibly hope for AND having a sense of humor to boot!!",

Then the second time around it came back medium, but still the overall quality of the dish just wasn't there.    They were very nice to write \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plates for our desserts which were very nice, but the desserts were mediocre at best.  I'm assuming the pastry chef isn't up to par here.  Overall, very nice service and I loved our waiter who was very flamboyant and friendly.  A very thorough and good photographer too!  He stepped back and took three different angles with the camera!  Bravo!",

The food was executed perfectly, and wine pairings featured some interesting choices that the sommelier helped us learn about.  -1 star for the final lamb course. Somehow, having the pan seared foie gras right before basically stole the show. I think it's pretty hard to beat that dish. But maybe I'm just Californian and deprived? Anyway, the lamb was cooked well, but didn't wow me.   Service, wine, and course pacing were great.",

    "text": "Spoiler alert: the bill is average $120 per person.  With that being said, if you want to be a foodie...or at least act the part...or just be treated like you own the Bellagio for a night, come right on down.  It's located down the escalators and it will be one of the most decadent meals of your life.  I don't claim to know wine or liqueurs but I know they must be seriously good for the price they offer and the staff is great about suggesting pairings with your meal.  What I do claim to know is tasty food and that they do deliver.  You can pick from 2 menus: the Degustation menu (5 course) or the Prix Fixe (4 course).  With only a $10 difference, I opted for the 5 course.  I will summarize because many have tasted the gloriousness that I have and have lived to write about it as well.  Maine Lobster Salad: salad as in tuna salad, chicken salad, etc.  Cool, refined, and accentuates the lobster.  Not overly drowned in superfluous additives like mayo.  Pan-seared Scallop:  I have tasted tender scallops... but this was picture-perfect, cut-with a fork, sophisticatedly simple.  Steak Foie Gras: probably my least favorite but only by personal taste.  Nice blacked crust with a tangy center.  Basically blackened foie gras.  Kobe Filet Mignon: yes ladies and gentlemen, I chose to add $160 to my meal and try this heavenly cut of beef.  Perfectly marbled and juicy (recommended medium-rare).  While I may not agree that it should cost an additional $160, I cannot deny that it was the highlight of my dinner and probably the best cut of beef I have ever tasted.  Also accompanied by a the best ring of mashed potatoes but still no contest.  You can get kobe cuts across the street at Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris and frankly better than anything I've eaten in my life (until I ate at Picasso).  Dessert:  by now you will be full and probably not appreciate the choice as much as you should.  Tough choices... but if you make it this far, congratulations and here's to hoping payday comes soon after this meal.  Great staff...they know that for a lot of us, this meal hurts the pockets, but they guide you through it and they talk like all those fancy waiters in the movies too",

I love bread but was not a fan of the bread service here. However, that worked in my favor as I got to enjoy every bite of my meal. The amuse bouche when we went was this mini prosciutto croquette and soup and I could have just eaten that all night long.   Ambience was great.  Price point is just amazing. I was surprised at how affordable it was.  My husband and I stayed and walked around the restaurant looking at the art (we had a late dinner so there were not many diners at this time).",

Very nice service from the start.  The Picasso art hanging throughout is remarkable. The flowers and atmosphere- outstanding without being stuffy. We were sat next to the window and watched the fountains go off. Our server was exceptional. He said he'd been there for 15+ years and it made me think that they must not have much turnover in employees and its a good sign to have loyal employees for that long.  The star though was the food. I was amused to learn that they call the squab- pigeon and the venison is referred to as deer, simplicity at its best.  I had the butternut soup, the trout, and the pigeon. So good. Small taste portions but I was completely satisfied and happy to end it with the pear dessert and a great cup of coffee. A night and meal I will remember. Worth every star on yelp and every Michelin star its known for.  We were sent home with a little box with a couple muffins in them. Nice touch.",

Proportions are small, but since it is a multi-course dinner my family and I felt very full in the end. The dish presentations are a piece of artwork in themselves and the food is not too heavy. The flower arrangements and the surrounding artwork make for an unforgettable experience.

    "text": "I was really excited to come here, as this would be only my 2nd two-Michelin star restaurant experience to date. Unfortunately, I went away a tad disappointed; I expected a 2-Michelin star restaurant to give me a 5-(Yelp) Star experience.  Food: 4 stars Service: 2 stars Decor: 5 stars  First, lemme start off with the decor. It's usually not that important to me, but it's hard to (and you shouldn't) ignore it at Picasso. They have over $100M worth of Picasso originals hanging on the walls, right behind dining tables. Why each piece isn't protected with a glass case is beyond me, but it's really cool.  Now for the food. I opted for the Prix Fixe menu, as opposed to the Menu Degustation. My first course was a carrot and ginger soup with sauteed maine ruby red shrimp. Tasty. My second course was a sauteed filet of salmon with cauliflower mousseline and saffron sauce. Even tastier. The main course was braised short ribs with potato gratin and bleu cheese. I thought the potato gratin was delicious; there was bleu cheese between each layer of potatoes, which made it really enjoyable. For dessert, I opted for the \"oatmeal cookie\", which was a flan, with bits of oatmeal cookie, grape sorbet, and some raisins and grapes. I didn't really enjoy the dessert that much. Overall, the food was good but I've certainly had better at \"lesser\" restaurants (both in price and prestige).  Lastly, the service was way below what you'd expect from a 2-Michelin star restaurant. The servers weren't rude, per se, but they made too many mistakes. After telling our waiter that we'd need only a couple more minutes to decide, he didn't come back to our table for at least another 15 minutes. Twice they served plates to the wrong person at the table; the second time, one of them blamed the waiter (in front of us) for telling him the wrong position at the table. If you're counting, that's 3 strikes right there. Also, when I ordered our 2nd bottle of wine, the server let my friend (the other guy at our table) do the pre-pour taste. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means, but you have to get that right!!!  I may be a little bit picky, but when you're paying steep prices for fine dining, it's expected that a 2-Michelin star restaurant executes every single bit of detail to near-perfection, if not to perfection. You may have 2-Michelin stars, but you're only getting 3 Yelp stars from me (and no, service, food, and decor aren't weighted equally in my book).",

He knew everything there was to know whether it was info on other delectable restaurants and fun facts about the Bellagio! He was so great because he didn't have a negative attitude even when we didn't want bottles of wine (very rare in a place like this) and wasn't even forcing us to order the more expensive menu!

In any case, there is definitely nothing wrong with the food here.  For a restaurant of this caliber perhaps the breads should have more variety and, frankly, quality.  Just wasn't memorable.

From the original works by Picasso gracing the walls, to a waterside view of the Bellagio water show during dinner, the ambiance does not get any better than this.  The service in this Michelin two star rated restaurant is top notch.  The attentive servers never need to be asked to do anything for you, as they appear and disappear magically on cue, before one can even sense a need to have a glass refilled or move on to the next course of the meal.  And the prix fix menu created by Julian Serrano makes me drool all over myself whenever I think about it.  From the Amuse Bouche, to the U-10 Day Boat Scallops, to the Foix Gras (that hubby cannot stop raving about), all the way to dessert and delightful little gift box of petit fours they gave me as we left the restaurant, Picasso is definitely one of Vegas' finest.  I give this restaurant an A+ for Ambiance, Service and Fine Cuisine.  When making reservations, request a waterside table if you want some of the best seats for the Bellagio water show.",

    "text": "In a nutshell:  Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4.5 stars P/C: 3.5 stars  I went to this restaurant on a number of times and the most recent was at the end of July (but my review is really cumulative).  There were two of us - my and my girlfriend.  I called in ahead of time to request for the seat that would have the fountain view and...we got it!  The restaurant was pretty empty right at 6pm when they first opened for dinner so we got all the attention from the servers that we could ask for.  We got a bottle of duval-leroy paris collection to celebrate.  one of us opted for the degustation menu (5 courses) and the other the pre-fix menu (4 courses).  In the appetizer section - we got an assortment of the poached oysters with caviar on top, pan seared scallops, pan-seared foie gros, foie-gros torchon, and main lobster salad.  Frankly, nothing was memorable.  The seafood dishes were well executed and nicely seasoned but nothing that wowed me.  The foie gras torchon was very nicely executed although I believe that the pan seared foiegras was a bit over done (bordering tough).  For the main course, I got the veal chop and my girlfriend the halibut.  The halibut was once again...well treated and executed but nothing more than an average.  The veal chop on the other hand, was awesome - it was tender, very well seared and cooked to perfect medium for my liking.  It was the highlight of the night.  The desserts - I got the chocolate fondant cake and my girlfriend the melon three ways.  Nothing too memorable either.  If a two-star restaurant can't move me in the dessert area, then there's a problem in my opinion.    Now onto the service - we couldn't have asked for a more seamless and courteous service from the floor staff.  They were never intrusive and kept their light-heartedness and cool the whole time.  We were there for over 3.5 hours and they were perfect.   The maitre d' on the other hand - I don't know what the hell was wrong with her.  Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?  Had a fight with her boyfriend/girlfriend?  Ate something that gave her a constipation?  She was monotone and not happy.  Having beautiful eye lashes and walking on her pretty skinny legs may be one qualification but maintaining a professional and absolutely courteous demeanor is THE qualification.  Maybe I should have slipped her a $20 and maybe things may have gone better.    The decor - awesome.  Dining with millions of dollars worth of picasso pieces...just freaking great.  In conclusion:  If they can really kick it up a notch with the dishes and replace the maitre d' that clearly needs metamucil, I'd love to return to this very special joint!!!",

The excitement of vegas is echoed by the bellagio fountain show, but the chaos is muted by the dark lighting and impressive picasso paintings.  It's like watching the world from inside a a fishbowl.  You know, a fishbowl with picassos.  My wife and I each ordered the menu degustation with the standard wine pairing.  The sommelier informed us that the premium wine pairing comprised of wines that were more scarce, but certainly not superior.  We decided on the standard wine pairing which was stupendous.  i appreciated that the sommelier not only described each wine, but also described why each wine was chosen as the compliment to each dish.  that was special.  The first dish was a small lobster salad with an apple -champagne vinaigrette...very plump juicy and fresh morsels of lobster in a light sauce.  every other bite brought a surprise crunch of peppercorn that spiced up the lobster and added another dimension to the sweet shellfish and sauce.  The second dish was a pan seared day boat scallop.  this dish was a show stopper.  every element of this dish enhanced every other flavor.  the scallop was seared just perfectly, melting in my mouth yet maintaining the bounce of a fresh scallop.  scallops are very difficult to cook perfectly.  i've been to a number of spectacular restaurants that have had very disappointing scallops--typically overcooked and rubbery.  no problems here.  buttery, clean, and rich.    the third dish was the foie gras with roasted almonds.  at this point i locked eyes with my wife and we both had the \"wtf did i just taste... did that just happen?\" look.  insane.  spectacular.  rich. indulgent.   the wine pairing was the most impressive of the night as well.  my favorite foie gras ever.   dish number four?  oh yes, the 150 supplement of True japanese a5 kobe beef.  this is't the same faux-be kobe you've had before...this was the real deal Holyfield. kobe beef had been banned from the usa due to health concerns from japanese cattle.  that was until last year, when the ban was lifted.  ordered my steak medium rare.  it was...flawless.  it was the richest thing i've eaten in my life.  and it was surprisingly LARGE for such a decadent piece of meat.  i have been the king of eating big steaks.  i'm like john candy from the great outdoors when he eats the great 96'er... this steak was probably 8 ounces but was so incredibly rich and buttery that i couldn't finish it.  i feel humiliated even writing that.    last dish was a choice from 5 or 6 dessert options.  delicious and also surprisingly generous portions  overall and unparalleled experience.  i will be back!!!",

    "text": "Overall, my wife and I had a fabulous time.  We had a delicious meal, and got to sit within feet of several gorgeous Picassos.  I don't really know of anywhere else I could eat and say the same thing.  We were originally seated right next to the waiter station, and it was really noisy.  I politely asked to be re-seated, and we were in a nicer, quieter table in seriously 30 seconds.  We got the degustation menu with wine pairing.  Our favorite courses were the scallops (my wife still talks about how perfectly they were cooked) and the foie gras.  I also loved the lamb - I have never had tastier lamb, bar none.  To be frank, the wine pairing was good, but not memorable.  We really had a good time, and enjoyed ourselves.  It was a memorable night.  However, for the price, I do not know that we would return.  It was nearly 500 with tip.  Not a knock on the place, the food and wine just wasn't worth a return visit given the price.  I know it is Vegas, but still.  It was an experience, but I doubt we would go back.",

This was both our first Michelin dining experience and it was rather enjoyable.  My gf paired the wines and I tasted each, the pairings were very nice.  I did a fair amount of reading reviews here and tripadvisor to get a feel for it.  I recomend reading and making your own decision because it is not for everyone, also pull up the menu online and check it out if this is your first time going there.  It was a great experience and she was ecstatic, the waiters and servers were polite, and the food was good.  It seems the menu hasn't changed in years or I went the same time everyone else did because the menu was the same as some of the old reviews here.  We met the chef and he spent several minutes at our table chit-chatting, it was a very nice touch.  My only complaint is they could have served the courses just a bit faster, I was ready for a 2 hour dinner not 3, much over 2:30 is too long, specially in Vegas!  We went first thing at 1730 and had the patio to oursleves for the first half or our meal...something to consider...  All in all it was worth it, more for the expierence than the food, but both were excellent.",

Also, if you like iced tea order some and ask for sweetener even if you are an unsweetened kind of person just to see the layout. I've never seen anything like it because your waiter brings you sugar cubes, simple syrup and agave nectar on platter and puts in at your finger tips for the rest of the night. Food was incredible. My practical husband was concerned that he would be paying hundreds of dollars for one thing on the plate and a swirl of sauce. He and I were both so full we could not finish dessert, which is a sin against humanity.   This is one of those moments where you will remember it for the rest of your life.",

My husband and I enjoyed a memorable meal at Picasso last night, where we had the privilege of being seated at a table for two outside directly in front of the Bellagio fountains. We have had the pleasure of dining in many fine restaurants and agreed that this meal had earned a spot in our top 2 or 3 favorite restaurants.The amuse bouche we were welcomed with started the meal off in the right spirit and we appreciated the prompt offer of assistance from the sommelier. Every course was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. Standouts included the lobster salad and seared foie gras with vanilla and rhubarb (a very generous portion!) from my 5-course degustation menu, and the quail salad and veal from my husband's four-course prix-fixe. My husband and I truly enjoyed our evening sipping wine, feeling the cool mist from the fountains, and savoring expertly prepared cuisine, while the hustle and bustle of the strip sparkled from across the way. Certainly this is the way to enjoy Las Vegas.",

    "text": "I was pretty impressed.  Dress Code wasn't an issue.  We were walking around all day and didn't have time to go back and change, so I was wearing jeans and a shirt with casual shoes.  No problems... I like the fact that it wasn't as pretentious as some other michelin star restaurants. the water show and paintings were pretty cool.  Pre Fixe with wine pairing Review (sommelier review at the bottom):  1) Amuse- 4/5- bell pepper soup with some kind of fried bird and a small piece of prosciutto.  My only issue with this is that the soup wasn't really a \"one-bite\" kind of deal, it was at least 3 gulps and i wasn't sure how to play them together.  2) Butternut Squash Soup 4/5- Paired with white.  I thought the soup was pretty good, it had marshmellows and some kind of mushroom concoction in the middle.  I thought it went well with the wine selected.  3) Foie Gras with Roasted Pineapple - 6/5- this was the best foie gras ever!  It was paired with a really sweet wine, might even have been a dessert wine.  But the pairing was absolutely amazing.  The foie came with bread, microgreens, a sweet jam, and the roasted pineapple.  The pineapple was almost \"candyish\" on the outside.  the combo was \"the best i ever had, the best i ever had\"  4) Short Rib- 4.5/5 - I think i should have opted for the Australlian Kobe.  The short rib was tender and great, but just wasn't anything I haven't had.  Prepared perfectly.  I thought there was a bit too much mash, and it wasn't stiff enough.  5) Desserts-  We had:  Chocolate Fondant-  2nd Favorite- it was good... but once again, wasn't too \"different\" Chocolate Beignets with peanut butter ice cream-  Favorite** The flavors were really rich and had a nice combo of textures (adding peanuts and other crunchy goodnesses)  6/7) Last two things you get is about 8 little truffle candies and when we left, we got a nice box with three \"butterflies\"/palmiers.  all good.... nothing bad...   Sommelier Review-  I thought he was great because he explained the tones/notes/flavors very well.  My only issue was that he talked a bit fast and i couldn't capture other information.  I am not a wine person, so when a sommelier tells me about where it grows and regions in spain/france that i've never heard it, that goes in one ear and through the other.  I think all sommeliers should ask \"Your level of wine knowledge?\"... or maybe i'm just not getting it....  Loved Picasso... would go back again...",

    "text": "I technically want to give it 4.5 stars, but I'm being nice and rounding up :)    The decor is beautiful, with a great view of the fountains from many of the tables.   The food is fantastic. I've been to several 2 and 3 star Michelins, and this one deserves its 2 star status. The amuse bouche was very good. The lobster was some of the best lobster I have had (so tender and fresh). The scallop dish was also good. The foie gras was cooked very well, but the accompaniment tasted like apple sauce, and it was not good. I usually opt for some kind of beef dish, but I ordered the Colorado lamb. This was AMAZING. The best lamb I've ever had. Not at all gamey, so flavorful, with a great mint aioli.  My friend and I shared two desserts, the butterscotch cheese cake and pear tart dish and the chocolate bouffant dish. Both were very good. It's hard to impress me with desserts, but these were quite good (slight preference for butterscotch pear dish). You could also opt for a cheese plate for an add-on.    The service was pretty good, although I didn't love our waiter. The other wait staff were great, but the waiter was a little cold. In a place of this caliber (i.e., a 2 star Michelin), part of the experience is being treated as though you are special. Definitely not with our waiter (and thus, my desire for 4.5 stars).    They opened the doors late, and made us all stand outside like cattle waiting to get called in (beyond our appt time).   Also, the take home cookies were stale, according to my friend. I didn't even eat one b/c they didn't look appetizing. No point giving out a treat if it isn't good.   But I still chose a 5 star rating b/c well.... the food was damn good.",

The service is great (except for a condescending server but I didn't let that ruin my night) and the restaurant was very pretty. They have 150 million dollars worth in Picasso paintings/sculpture/dishes, very impressive. The reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because some of the dishes served were good but not amazing I was expecting to go to heaven and back at this place. I'm slightly disappointed because  I heard so many good things but the only dishes that I thought were worth while were the lobster salad and the Foie Gras. My (and my husband's) scallops were really sandy (that should not happen in such a high end restaurant). Anyways my entree was the lamb and it was extremely salty in one side and kinda bland in the other but the meat was tender and cooked perfectly so I have to give that to them. The dessert was ok I had the jioconde and it really tasted like something picked out of the buffet. Anyways generally speaking it was ok. Don't come with high expectations.",

    "text": "A-  I going to preface my review by letting you know that I'm a Chef and I will put some of my more detailed comments toward the end of this review.  We dined here at 8:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. The location is stellar, with beautiful views of the Bellagio Fountains. The finest service I have received anywhere I have ever dined! Presentation of the food was simple, elegant and spot on. Nothing too showy, which I appreciated. My wife, who has a good palate, was thrilled with everything she was served. We had the Prix Fixe menu with the Wine Pairings and chose different items, so that we could have a wider variety of items to taste. The only down side that I would comment on, that a regular diner might notice, is that I was served a \"corked\" wine with my entree. After speaking with our waiter, I was surprised to find out that they don't \"sniff\" the wines before serving them. I don't think that this is an unreasonable expectation, when you're paying over $250 a head for dinner.  ***CHEF COMMENTS(These are minor criticisms and will NOT BE noticeable to the vast majority of diners.)*** The Amuse Buche was a duck croquet over a smear of Tomato Coulis. The tomato came through a little too much. I had the Warm Quail Salad paired with an Spanish Rose from Priorat. On the surface I love this pairing. However I found the Rose pulled too many bitter elements from the frisee-heavy salad, which weren't overcome by the fattiness of the quail. The quail was cooked perfectly and once again, presentation was excellent. I was curious as to the origin of the pine nuts used in the dish, since I've run into some \"pine mouth\" inducing pine nuts from China, and although I inquired of the kitchen, I was never given an answer by our waiter. I skipped the nuts to be safe. My wife had the poached oysters with a Sancerre, which she adored, presented in an ingeniously folded napkin. I then had the Black Bass paried with an Assyrtiko. The bass, which was cooked beautifully, but had a bit too much salt on the skin. It was served with the Cauliflower Mousseline which was exquisite. My wife loved her Fois Gras with Huckleberry(Blueberry?) Jam paired with a late harvest Mourvedre. Initially excited at trying this sweet red, I found that the pairing was far too sweet, and combined with the richness of the fois gras, the small bite was overwhelming to my palate. My wife adored this Bacchanailan combination! For my entree I had the Wagyu(domestic) Short Rib paired with an Argentinian Malbec. The short rib was wrapped in thinly sliced, baby zucchini. Gorgeous and delicious. Unfortunately this is where I ran into the corked Malbec, which I luckily noticed with a slight sniff and hadn't sipped. They replaced it with a rustic red from Priiorat Spain, that I found too be a little too rough. I tried a sip of the red, an Amarone style also from Argentina, that was paired with my wife's entree, but after the initial sip, it was obviously far too rich for the short rib.  My wife had the Fallow Deer Medallions, which were very lean and beautifully paired with that red.  I opted for the Cheese Assortment(additional $14) for my dessert and it was delightful! I only had Pelligrino at that point, since my palate was getting tired. The cheesed were varied and delicious, with a couple being a touch ammoniated. My wife had the Earl Grey Cheesecake with was excellent and again, beautifully presented. While enjoying our dessert we were presented with a  small assortment of delicious pastries that, although I was already very full, I made a point of sampling. I was surprised to be presented with the bill, before asking for it. A very American thing to do in a restaurant that leans heavily on being French. Although presented with the bill, I didn't feel as if I was being rushed out and I noticed a number of other diners lingering and enjoying each others company and the view of the fountain shows,  which occur every fifteen minutes. Upon leaving we were given two beautiful boxes with two tiny muffins inside for our breakfast the next morning.  A nice gesture, although the muffins were unexceptional. ***ONCE AGAIN***** These are very minor critics of a spectacular restaurant. If we find ourselves in Las Vegas, we will eat here again. I highly suggest, that if you have the means, to treat yourselves to this experience.",

    "text": "Let me start with the positive: Original Picasso paintings adorn the walls, the decor is very elegant, fresh flowers fill the tables, and we got the best table in the house -- with a great view of the Bellagio fountains, which made it all the more romantic.   Now, moving on to the mediocre: the food just wasn't out of this world. I think Picasso relies on the paintings to keep people coming. However, they need to up the ante on their food because I was not impressed.   I was also irked by how people were taking pictures of the paintings. NOT cool. Have some class, please?!",

    "text": "Wasn't firing on all cylinders for our visit.   Out of five courses, four with premium wine pairings, the lobster in the lobster salad was curiously flavorless and sucked the life out of the excellent aged Gruner Veltliner, the wonderful seared day boat scallop matched perfectly with Vouvray, the dessert wine was an out of this world match with the incredible Foie Gras steak, and the wines served with our excellent main courses, red snapper and lamb, were a buzz kill, virtually undrinkable.   The red was too young and tannic and the white was thin, yet shrill and might have been open too long.  Dessert was lovely, but by that time we had to wolf it down because we were running late.  Regarding service; we asked to be finished by 8:15 in order to make a 9pm show across town. We thought two hours would give us time for a leisurely paced meal. The wines were sometimes served as much as 30 minutes prior to the arrival of the accompanying food and we had to sprint out of there at 8:45, thirty minutes later than we had requested.",

Even though the portions seemed small, I left full and very satisfied.   This place is especially interesting to people watch at because you can tell everyone comes from the MOOOOOONAY. I dare say they have actual Picasso paintings hanging on the wall as decor. When we left, we were given goodie boxes with pastries inside.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas. If you have a celebratory event, definitely check this place out. It's become an institution at the Bellagio. Just be down to drop $500+ on a meal for 3 people.  P.S. We came comp'd",

Surrounded by Picasso's beautiful works of art, eating decadent cuisine inspired by the regions of France and Spain where Pablo Picasso spent much of his life, how could it get any better than that? In my opinion it simply can't! The staff was very attentive, friendly and professional. We all had the prix fixe with the wine pairing. Every course was delicious and complemented perfectly by the wine. It was divine!!!",

We started with an amuse bouche with a cup of potato soup, and a skewered quail egg with cucumber, smoked salmon, and caviar.  I started with a Maine lobster salad, then foie gras, with an entree of roasted pheasant.  Sides included mashed sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, and brioche stuffing.  We all got amazing desserts--chocolate and pecan pie, mocha & hazelnut opera, chocolate fondant, and chestnut blini.  The service was impeccable.  The food was incredible.  The lobster was perfectly cooked, and paired with a tiny bit of mayonnaise and a sparkly champagne vinaigrette.  The foie gras was melt in your mouth fantastic.  The pheasant had a flavorful, crispy skin and wasn't gamey at all.  Amazing food, amazing experience, and a wonderful Vegas Thanksgiving dinner with the family.  Thank you Picasso!",

    "text": "Full review in blog:  Notes on their degustation.  Arriving as we sipped our drinks the nightly amuse would be Cold Smoked Scottish Salmon, Caviar, Cucumber, Quail Egg, Creme Fraiche, and Potato Leek Soup.  Served curled around the creme fraiche the salmon was excellent - more firm than a sashimi prep, but similar in taste.  With the caviar somewhat less briny than others I've tasted it worked well with the somewhat sour creme while the egg added its characteristic creamy flavor.  The Potato soup was a commendable potage - the creamy texture balanced nicely with the onions and chives.  With myself ordering the 5-course degustation, largely unchanged over many years at Picasso, and Erika opting to go Prix Fixe for more choices our first courses would arrive simultaneously.  For my first dish, Maine Lobster Salad - Apple-Champagne Vinaigrette was ample in portion, elegant in presentation, and lovely on the palate.  With thick chunks of chilled lobster in a light cream sauce serving as the base, the \"salad\" was essentially microgreens tossed with apple-cider accented vinaigrette atop.  Flanked by melon balls and tomatoes of varying colors the dish was quite light, a wonderful opening volley even if it was much more \"lobster\" than \"salad.\"  Course two was a Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop with Potato Mousseline and Jus de Veau.  Served with a potato crisp standing playfully behind the single monstrous scallop the dish looked beautiful and the tastes were lovely, albeit predictable with the savory veal reduction balancing the sweet scallop.  With the creamy potato puree loaded with butter the place where this dish missed was in the centerpiece - gorgeously caramelized to the point of a near brulee on the exterior the scallop was simply a bit too well done at its center.  While certainly a competent and lovely preparation the fact remains that perhaps twenty less seconds on the pan could have elevated it to a whole different level.  The next course would provide my sister with an empty charger while I would receive the Sauteed \"A\" Steak of Foie Gras with Poached Pears, Huckleberries, Crushed Pistachios, Lemon Zest, and Rhubarb.  A large steak of 3-4 ounces of high quality and perfectly cleaned Foie Gras, the liver itself was everything you would expect.  Placed atop a \"cake\" of compressed pistachio and topped with roasted crunchy pistachios kissed with lemon the textures were a nice contrast and exceptionally complimentary.  Swirled with rhubarb reduction and plated alongside a poached pear with huckleberries this dish did not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but it was quite memorable for its classic approach.  The main course was Roasted Lamb Chops with Sweet Bell Pepper Farci turned out to be quite the substantial portion - easily 7-8oz including the bone.  Prepared rare and extremely juicy yet easily cut with the side of the fork this was without a doubt a top-5 all time lamb preparation.  Presented simply with rosemary, a stack of buttery potatoes, and a melange of sweet bell peppers this would prove my favorite dish of the evening, regardless of how good the Foie Gras was.  Hazelnut and Coffee Opera with Coffee Hazelnut Ice Cream and Brown Sugar Filberts was quite impressive in presentation.  With a thin wedge of moist cake served on edge with a \"shadow\" of Hazelnut dust the flavor and texture of the cake was somewhere between almond dacquoise and tiramisu.  Resting happily next to the tall and proud cake, a small ball of similarly flavored ice cream atop candied nuts - creamy and crunchy, a nice cake and ice cream combination but certainly nothing to write home about.  Making our way from Picasso I must say I left with mixed emotions - not because anything was bad - as a matter of fact, everything was quite good.  The issue was that aside from a lovely Christmas Eve with my little sister at a restaurant that seemed unattainable a mere 8 years ago, nothing was \"great\" aside from the decor and art.  In the end I think Picasso has maintained its place in the Vegas culinary scene - it is just that many other restaurants, and my own personal dining preferences, have perhaps grown to be something more.",

    "text": "We went here recently and had a nice dinner with friends.  I say nice because there were a few highlights, but overall it wasn't amazing.  Top three things about Picasso: 1.  We sat on the balcony and had an AMAZING view of the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes.  It was quite cold, but they had the heaters going and they offered the ladies an extra shawl to wear.  The husbands suffered, but such is life. 2.  The sommelier was so personable, knowledgeable, and just the best one we've ever had ANYWHERE! 3.  The desserts were totally on point in terms of presentation AND taste. My husband, friend, and I did the standard tasting menu and our other friend did the degustation menu.  It was nice that they allowed the table to choose different options.  I started with the Creme of Parsnip Soup with rock shrimp and coulis of curry which was delicious, especially on the cold night.  Then I had the Sauteed Filet of Chilean Sea Bass with cauliflower mouseline and saffron sauce which was pretty good, but just a tad dry- nothing to write home about.  I wanted to have something unique so I went with the Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer with caramelized green apple and zinfandel sauce.  Again, it was okay, but I thought it lacked a little flavor.  For dessert I went with the Earl Grey Cheesecake which, as mentioned earlier, didn't disappoint.  I don't think we'll be rushing to go back to Picasso, but I would go back.  If it weren't so expensive, I might not be as critical.  Good, but not worth the tab.",

    "text": "A beautiful restaurant with a view to kill for, perfect food, and perfect service.  Alright!  See you next review!  Well, OK.  I guess my paltry review might be interesting to someone (probably not), but here goes.  The interior is gorgeous.  The artwork, the decor, everything.  Everyone greets you warmly and with a smile.  No stuffiness at all, it's all very warm and inviting.  We sat outside and, except for an occasional mist of water and ducks trying to get in on our dinner, it was perfect.  The fountains look majestic from this side, illuminated by Paris and Planet Hollywood.  Our waiter was delightful.  Very entertaining, friendly, warm, knowledgeable and attentive.  All of the wait staff was top notch.  The sommelier was amazing and rightfully proud of the pairings he selected.  These were, by far and away, the best wine pairings I've ever had.  It seems like the chef and the sommelier designed their menus together, because the food and the wine perfectly compliment each other.  I mean REALLY compliment.  Not in terms of vague overtones, or mouthfeel, or anything terribly abstract.  The wines TASTED like they belonged right alongside the dishes; like they would be incomplete without each other.  Amazing.  If you do the tasting menu and don't get wine pairings you're doing it wrong.  The first course was the Maine Lobster Salad.  More lobster than salad, which is fine with me.  The succulent, sweet lobster is molded and topped with kind of like a micro-greens salad.  The apple and champagne vinaigrette gave a nice acidity which cut through the richness of the lobster.  Complimenting the dish are pink peppercorns which explode with the absolute perfect flavor (that is also present in the accompanying wine!!!)  and tiny balls of avocado and cantaloupe which give the lobster a creamy companion to contrast with the sharpness of the vinegar.  Next was the scallop.  Personally the biggest scallop I'd ever seen.  Seared beautifully with a nice brown crust.  The scallop was so tender, even on the bed of light, creamy mousseline, it seemed like it couldn't even support it's own weight.  Sweet and succulent doesn't even describe the scallop, and the veal jus was a surprisingly good accompaniment.  This was my wife's favorite dish of the evening.  And then, the foie gras.  The duck liver is just perfectly cooked: impeccably seared on the outside, with just enough heat in the middle to just soften the fat enough so that it literally (really, literally) melts in your mouth.  Accompanied by a rhubarb reduction of a sweet Hungarian wine, which is served as the pairing.  The sommelier recommended alternating every bite.  He was right.  Incredible.  I had the lamb with pisto, mint, and and a tempura zucchini flower.  The dish is just beautiful.  I almost didn't want to eat it, it was an amazing work of art.  But I did.  It was good.  Really, really good.  Lamb, surprise, was cooked perfectly.  The pisto was a perfect accompaniment, and the mint was great and not overpowering.  Desert was definitely the most artistic looking course.  Beautifully presented, and delicious on top.  I opted for the one with the mini cinnamon buns.  Not too sweet and a great balance of flavors.  Obviously I could have ended this review in one line.  What's the point?  Of course everything was amazing.  But one line wouldn't do this restaurant justice for how perfect everything is.",

    "text": "A michelin experience of good food, but terrible service, which left me no choice but giving Picasso a two star.   We had a weekend stay in Vegas and booked a dinner reservation at Picasso on Saturday night before our show in Bellagio. The deco was a bit dark and heavy, but I did like the flower arrangements throughout the restaurant.   They offered a few menu options. We were mostly interested in the fixed menu and the prix fixe menu. We could select each course our of a few options. We were all satisfied with pretty much all the courses we ordered. Everything was good, I was especially impressed with the foie gras and the pigeon entrees.   However, the quality food was tainted by the poor quality of service. The lead server (his name might be Jose). He was rather pushy when I was contemplating if we should ordered the sea bass as the third course, even I picked the Turbot for my main course. We ignored the initial rudeness.   When finished all our course and ready to ordered dessert. I decided to skip dessert, but  other guests in my diner party did. Then Jose (assuming that's his name) brought me a dessert I didn't order. I told him I didn't order dessert, he said he picked this for me, since dessert is included. Then I said had I known the dessert is included, I'd wished he could have communicated that information to me so that at least I could pick one I liked or my friends liked.   He got very angry and impatient. He said \"do you want to change the dessert\" with a very condescending tone. \"It'd take 15 minutes\".  I told him not to bother.   Besides the unpleasant scenarios with this particular waiter. We also noticed other unprofessional service. e.g. waiter at other table dropped the menu on the ground accidentally. Another server of ours made a mistake of swapping the two dishes my friends ordered.   I was quite surprised that this place has two michelin stars given the service was stunningly terrible. The service staff is obviously not properly trained how to treat customers right. This is possibly the worst service I've had in all the michelin star restaurants I've been to.  They definitely didn't provide me with Picasso level of art in terms of service.",

It is obvious that a lot of thought and care is put into every dish.  I would have been happy with the poached oysters I had for my appetizer if that was all I was going to eat for the rest of the evening, but the hits kept coming throughout the evening. My husband especially loved his fallow deer.   The service was first-class all the way. The wait staff were attentive and efficient consistently throughout. Our waiter was very observant, personable and gracious.  There was a small issue with the sommelier forgetting to give my husband a pour of one of the wine flight pairings, but that was quickly remedied with an extra pour of our choice along with a complimentary dessert wine pairing that was not included in the wine flight.   Dining here was a very enjoyable experience.  Our senses were filled by the beautiful surroundings, excellent service, and amazing food. Expensive, but well worth it!",

On the way to your table you can drink in the ambiance of the tables & bowls of fragrant flowers and the gallery style Picasso's adorning the walls. The wait staff was friendly and accommodating without the snobbery of \"fine restaurant attitude\" and immediately began taking care of us. In fact, when I was overwhelmed by the wine list, they sent over the sommelier (which I was hesitant to request as I was looking for a bottle of wine under $100, and their selections went into the thousands of dollars)! A recommendation of a great white and a reasonable price was offered that we all thoroughly enjoyed.  The choice you have is either the pre-fixe (4 course with apps and entree selection choices) menu or the degustation (5 course, entree selection only), and choice of desert for both, so an open mind is necessary. Our party had both and every bite was incredibly delicious and mouth-tingling. We shared tastes, salivating at each others selection. Two things I will point out, the seared foie gras was to die for and the scallop was perfectly done, buttery and unbelievable tasty. But that applies to almost everything we ate. Perfection personified. A very special treat!",

    "text": "Already? It's been a month since I started being a Yelper and it's already my 100th review! To make my 100th special, I thought hard (for about 2 min) on which restaurant I should write about... Simply enough, I decided to write on my favorite restaurant Picasso.   Honestly, I like checking out Michelin Star restaurants, but I am not always impressed because I become more of a critical reviewer at restaurants that costs more. Yes, I am a believer for paying for chef's art, beautiful atmosphere and best service, but \"food\" should taste extra good (because good is not enough) to deserve such a high-end restaurant name, no?  Picasso satisfied all.  Even with all the restaurants I have been to, it's one of rare restaurants that brought \"WOW........................(speechless)\" from me. Mind-blowing food, amazing artwork of Picasso, great service, decent price (what you are getting), there is really nothing to complain about!!   ATMOSPHERE Picasso didn't disappoint with their decor. Overall, the ambiance was sophisticated and elegant.Well over $100M original works by Picasso on the walls everywhere, your eyes are immediately happy. I just wonder why each piece isn't protected with a glass! Although we requested \"somewhere romantic\", we were led to a cozy booth and were only able to peek at Bellagio's water show. If you can, sit by the window!  SERVICE What you would expect from two Michelin Star restaurant; the service was impeccable. They appear and disappear magically on cue, fulfilling everything you wanted and even those you didn't know you needed. Sommelier here was also amazing! We wanted to find the wine we drank on our first date & surely... after detailed description & trying to track down the taste we had of French Pinot Gris, the knowledgeable sommelier found it for us!!!!!! Yes, finding the rare wine we had on our first date definitely helped set the mood & made our dining much more special at Picasso.  FOOD Words cannot describe how amazing this dining experience was.  The entire meal did last long, about 2.5 hrs for us, so make sure you don't have a show to catch after the meal!  We ordered the Prix Fixe menu & Menu Degustation, because we wanted to try more....Well, and also because I wanted certain things on top of what I wanted to eat!  It's easier to like food I already love. However, what I can say about the Picasso's food is that there were many items I don't usually eat -- such as oysters & foie gras -- but they were DELICIOUS and I would return for more. Even my bf who doesn't like gamey meat like deer & who 'hates' foie gras, enjoyed everything. That's when I know that the food is SPECTACULAR...   -Olive bread - Good, but what's better? The butter! Yup. The butter with Picasso writing on it, which we ruined shortly after receiving...  -Amuse Bouche - 1) mushroom soup with chives and almond & 2) brioche with foie gras smear & apple. Both were good & got us excited for the main courses -Poached oysters - I don't eat oysters. But my foodie friends that recommended Picasso to me raved about their poached oysters & I really wanted to try it! Surely, it was unbelievably tasty! Creamy and sweet, with the slightly saltiness! -Maine lobster salad - Light and refreshing! The salad had huge pieces of lobster meat with tiny balls of different melons. Not only was it visually appealing, it was delicious! Although simple, it could be my favorite. A good way to start to the night.  -Scottish salmon - Not your ordinary salmon! Super creamy & buttery, this was my bf's favorite. -Pan seared scallops - Scallops were seared to PERFECTION period! One of the best scallop, if not the best, I have ever had!  -Steak of foie gras - Again, I am not a fan of foie gras... but this was smooth and savory! Unlike really rich foie gras that can be overwhelming, this was prepared buttery yet clean; with almost like a super tender steak! -Fallow deer - Of course, still gamey than steak, but this deer was tender and savory. Definitely the best deer I've had. -Halibut - I picked this over roasted lamb chops, because my bf is not a lamb lover. The halibut was cooked to perfection with clean taste. -Blood orange and raspberry glace - I chose this, as I am a blood orange lover. Wow! -Blackberry linzer tart -Bf & I both chose this for his selection of dessert. From this dessert, our fav was the black muscat sorbet! Yummm. -Mini dessert plate - As if we were not fed enough, the mini truffles and other tiny bites were very good! -Cookie box to take home! This, we had as 'breakfast' the next morning & it was goooood! Buttery layers of crisp cookies!      You are looking at around $150 for the fixed menu, adding a bottle of wine for $100+ to finish ~$450+ for two with good tip. (Thank you, BF!) Although definitely not cheap, it's not as over priced as some other restaurants & I do think it's worth every penny.   With A+ for Food, Ambiance, and Service, it's impossible for me not to recommend Picasso. I love you, chef Julian Serrano!",

Every course was delicious and well balanced.  I especially loved the lobster salad and the foie gras. You have a choice of three entrees, I choose the lamb, and while it was very good, it didn't seem to live up to the other courses.  We had a wonderful dinner here, and loved that the restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountain.  We will definitely come back here the next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I have to admit this restaurant is special.  The picasso paintings, his plates upon the walls, the fountains outside, it is a wonderful experience.  The abstract colored carpet and the waiters with their colorful ties is a little silly, but the restaurant is captivating.  The large painting at the bar is really a nice touch.  Service is definitely there but nothing to write home about.  I was having trouble deciding which main entree to choose, so I asked the waiter what his favorite was.  The answer was, \"depends on your preference.\"  Not the exact answer I was looking for, but I'm not about to judge a restaurant soley based off that.  Again, for a michelin star restaurant, there were times I was surprised silverware wasn't being replaced.  The food now.  If I could summarize the food, I would say it's finely crafted, and very very simple.  Each dish has great flavors, and each ingrednient can be easily tasted.  Do not expect to be wowed by innovation or creativity, but be prepared the enjoy each food for what it is in its purest form.  For instance, the poached oysters.  They were topped with a warm vermouth sauce and topped with a little caviar.  Elegant, simple and delicous.  Another example is the veal chop.  The chop itself was slightly seasoned, and the vegetables it was served with were seasoned with rosemary.  There was horseradish on the side for anyone who chose.  Again, nothing out of the ordinary, but well executed.  I would definitely take guests here.  If you're looking for a quiet, quaint evening this is the place to be.  Art lovers, or people who appreciate a wonderful meal in a relaxing setting, this is the place to go.  I would expect it to be amazing to sit outside when the weather is good, but you would not be allowed to enjoy the surrounding art.",

    "text": "With ALEX closing its doors couple years ago (see my review for ALEX), Vegas now has just 3 restaurants left having the highly prestigious Michelin 2 and 3 star awards. Picasso is one of them.  The walkway to meet the Maitre d' in the sitting area showcases a number of original sculptures by Pablo Picasso, including a $34 Million dollar painting that adorns the sitting room.  Another Pablo Picasso painting, hung right over my table, had me beg a question to the waiter. This restaurant has 11 Picasso paintings totaling a worth of $300 Million dollars, he says. I am dining in a fine arts museum. Another showcase that caught my attention every 15 minutes: the water fountain show since this establishment is adjacent to the Bellagio waters.  L'Amuse-Bouche was a tasting of Vichyssoise which is typically served cold, however the chef opted to present it as warm with a topping of almonds. Pairing this classic soup is a pheasant croquette topped with a sliver of prosciutto where its bold savoriness balanced with the light, airy and delicate croquette.  Quail Salad was served with sauteed artichokes and pinenuts. Despite salad status, the perfectly cooked Quail legs rises to the top as an excellent dish.  Oysters were poached in Sauce Vermouth and garnished with Osetra Caviar. The taste felt incomplete. This can be remedied by a light squeeze of zesty lemon juice to balance the warmth of Vermouth. I concluded the caviar did little to augment the flavor of oysters. I would have probably preferred the caviar to be served on the side to separate tasting notes.  Most American-based French restaurants usually pan-sear Foie Gras. Picasso however takes the classic \"Torchon\" approach, a tedious process of gently poaching and resting the cloth-wrapped goodness for several days. The result: a pure unadulterated taste of buttery rich Foie Gras, without the bitterness of searing, almost as pure as from the Terrine method of cooking. the crunchy texture of fried toast and sweetness from the delicately caramelized pineapple slices accompanied this overly rich organ. However I found either the accompaniment too small in portions or the Foie Gras too large to achieve such a balance.  Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer had a hint of gaminess as expected from this European deer, but was nevertheless tender and surrenders easily to a butter knife. Red Zinfandel marries a perfect match. Tasting balance here are caramelized green apples which I find effective.  Peanut Butter Mousse Timbale was served with Blackberry Pate de Fruit with Chocolate Torte and Banana Peanut Brittle Ice Cream. The brittle had a satisfying crack when broken by the dessert spoon, the Torte cake was moist and spongy, and the ice cream of course creamy. This dish was a play of textures and a grand exit to the prix fixe.  At about $300 (not counting wine), this dining experience is a bargain compared to the Guy Savoy costing twice as much for a comparable prix fixe, considering it's in the same 2-Star Michelin category. Despite noted flaws, I am giving 4 stars for good service, excellent venue (and art display) and great prices for their upscale cuisine.",

    "text": "I begin my Yelp career (this is my first review) with the best restaurant I've ever been to: Picasso at the Bellagio in Vegas.  I was there over two years ago, but the vivid memory is easy to draw from.  Hence, a ten minute stream of conciousness should suffice for an accurate review.  Picasso beat out both French Laundry and Aqua (unofficially numbers two and three) for the top spot on my all-time list.  While everything about my experience was arguably perfect, what stood out was the service and the wine pairing.  I've never seen six courses wedded to fine wines as amazingly as at Picasso.  Each dish was strengthened by a pairing with perfect balance.  The wine complemented the food, and vice versa.  (I'll spare the details as it was a long time ago; I could attempt to reconstruct but that wouldn't effectively tell the story).  This wine pairing is truly unreal; you'd be doing a disservice to yourself by passing it up.  I looked them up just now, and this all makes since; Picasso employs one of the few Master Sommeliers on earth, Robert Smith.  (Currently there are 158 with the title).  Cheers to you Robert.  And our server was incredible.  Very knowledgable, friendly, and without the slightest tinge of arrogance.  I thought our server could be running a fortune 500; he was professional, witty, and very knowledgable.  All this before even mentioning the roughly $65 mm worth of original Picassos overlooking the dining room tables.  I'm curious as to what their insurance policy looks like; I could have easily flung a chunk of Foie Gras at Picasso's \"Self Portrait\" and caused them quite a stir.  Good thing I've graduated from that type of high-chair behavior :-)",

However, after eating at Picasso the other night my eyes have been opened to a restaurant in Vegas that knows how to execute a great meal.  We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing and the food and pairings were spot on.  The sommelier, Robert was interesting in the fact that he told you facts about the wine made the experience educational and fun.  I really liked the room, lighting and the paintings of course make it hard to not be impressed by.  My only complaint would be that sometimes the food was brought to the table and just put down without telling us the components. I hate that - but that was a very slight negative.",

Highlights of the meal were the oysters poached in vermouth with Osetra caviar and the seared foie gras with lemon pound cake.  The walls are filled with Picasso's paintings and are lovely to look at while dining or face the Bellagio fountains which are beautiful at night. Chef Julian Serrano is wonderful to talk to and almost always in the kitchen cooking which is a rarity these days.",

You're sitting there, eating, chatting, listening to the soft background music, and then all of a sudden, you hear Celine Dion singing with explosive water \"pyrotechnics\".   But overall, it is just too great. I love eating here. My favorite dish is the one with the langoustine. *wipes drool off chin*",

    "text": "Picasso was a good meal, but there are better in Vegas (I had a better meal upstairs at Le Cirque if you are looking for something in the Bellagio)  Reading the Yelp reviews we made sure to get a table near the fountains, but if I were to go again I would request a table on the other side of the service table - the dining was more intimate there.  The fountains are cool, but you can see them from the strip, and during a fine meal they were un-neccessary noise.  Why 3 stars?  While our server was excellent, the service overall felt disorgainized. There were many times that our wine pairing would come out several minutes before the dish (or the option to get wine was only offered after desert was served).  Our personal server had excellent personality and attention, but overall the co-ordination between the front and the back of the house was disjointed and sloppy at this price point.  The wine pairing was the worst I have experienced at this level of dining. Two of the wines served during our meal I can buy at the local Whole Foods for less than $20 a bottle. While the flavors mached the food, the quality did not.  The wine steward should have taken time to understand who we were and serve appropriately (I mentioned that we had a Torrontes when we were on a tasting trip to Mendoza so it did not require as much exclaimation, but this was lost on him). I had to surpress a giggle when he was talking about the paring of Tokaji with Foie Gras (fairly standard if you do not go French). Also, when a pairing with the meal is purchased, it usually includes a pairing with the desert course, We waited for a bit staring at melting ice cream before realizing it would not come out.  The food was good overall, and kept in pace with other fine dining restaurants.",

I have no problem with a multi-course meal, with each course proportioned appropriately, but Picasso is not in that category. I did not like Chef Serrano's style of  preparation when he was at Masa in SF and I do not like it any more since he opened Picasso.  I had one dish that was supposed to represent the main course. There were about three bites of meat and the potatoes were the size of peas and not very numerous.  I really did not know how to react, it was as if some one was playing a prank by taking the less is more concept to the extreme.",

This place has the best oysters I have ever tried -and I try them everywhere I can. I tried them for he first time years ago and although they were prepared differently, they are still the best. The deer medallions are pretty fantastic as well. If the weather is nice and you want to sit out in the patio, make sure you're prepared to wait. They don't reserve those tables. If you sit out in the patio you get a perfect view of the Bellagio Water Show.  At the end of your meal, the waiter brings out a thick notebook to browse through with pictures of Picasso's work -which is nice to read and chat about over coffee or tea.",

We requested to sit outside, and on a June summer night, the scenery and weather was perfect. You'd get to watch the Bellagio fountain show every 20 minutes or so.   Unfortunately, I made a mistake of going there with an upset stomach. I ordered the $128 set from the fixed menu, but food from that selection was on the \"heavy\" side. I was overwhelmed by the combination of lobster, foie gras and lamb.   On any given night, you get to choose from two set menus - one is $118 and the other one is $128. Wine pairing will cost you an extra $50. The more expensive set serves one more appetizer than the cheaper one. However, I actually liked the $118 set better. First course of the $118 set comes with an oyster dish, and it was the best oyster I've ever had!   I will definitely return to Picasso. The dining experience was wonderful overall.",

What I saw of the interior area was very nice as well.  I had the Menu Degustation with the lamb and my girlfriend had the Prix Fixe menu with wine pairings. Overall the food was good, not great. There was nothing really memorable. The foie gras dishes were my favorites. The chocolate fondant was good too.  What I really wasn't expecting was the not so great service from a $$$$ restaurant. Little things add up, like them not cleaning up the bread crumbs off our table, and even leaving the bread plates on the table even though we had pushed them off to the side. In addition, we we're there to celebrate a birthday and for some reason we didn't get a birthday dessert like others I've seen. i kinda feel gypped.  A 2-star review might be a little harsh but I'm comparing it to other fancy restaurants and Picasso just doesn't hold up.",

    "text": "My second time dining at Picasso, and I'm still not sure what all the hype is about. My wife and I dined here on a Friday night. We had reservations at 8:30, and arrived right on time. We were told by the hostess that we would be seated momentarily, and after 20 minutes, we were finally brought to our table. After being seated and brought our menus, our waiter kindly greeted us, and asked wether we wanted still or sparkling water. After 17 minutes, we finally received water, and was able to give our waiter our drink orders. In total we waited 37 minutes to receive water. It may not seem like a long time, but as a diner in one of las vegas' fancier restaurants, those minutes seem like an eternity. I would've expected much better service at a restaurant of this caliber. This would be the theme for the entire night. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, but it just seemed like the restaurant was way understaffed.          As for the food, my wife ordered the 5 course menu, and I ordered off the 4 course menu. All the dishes were well prepared with fine ingredients, but this was vegas, and we wanted to be wowed. For our first course my wife ordered the lobster salad which she enjoyed, and I ordered the quail. The quail was well cooked, tender and salted properly, but not memorable. My wife had the scallop for the second course and I had the shrimp. The scallop was seared well and sitting on a bed of potatoes. It tasted exactly as it sounds. My shrimp was also cooked well and sitting on top of a slice of zucchini. It tasted like good shrimp sitting on top of a slice of zucchini.  My wife had an extra course, which was foie gras. Which was nice and rich, prepared on par with the other foie gras dishes that i've had.         For our main courses my wife had seared fish, which she found to be a little dry. I ordered the veal chop with jus, a giant hunk of meat that was prepared well, but once again, nothing spectacular. For dessert my wife ordered the panna cotta and i ordered the pineapple tart. The desserts were our favorite course, unique and quite delicious. Overall the dull food and slow service left us a little disappointed in our experience. We expected quite a bit more for a restaurant at this price point.",

There was a wonderful intimacy, dining amongst all that priceless art.  Times change, and what might be considered progression is actually regression, and alas, Picasso is just one of dozens expensive and glitzy restaurants that help Las Vegas preserve its \"cookie cutter\" onslaught on Capitalism.  This city knows how to wring those dollars from you.  Picasso is sadly a ghost of its former self.  The food was good, with three set menus, each one more expensive than the other one.  Service was excellent, if impersonal, and everything tasted fine. The room was very nice, with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  However, nothing, and I mean nothing, was special or memorable, from the taste, to the preparation, to the experience.  We were dining in a Disneyesque version of fine dining.  Programmed, practiced and enacted, this kind of dining feels like a computer spat out a plan and action for Picasso.  I don't enjoy this type of corporate eating.  For the $300.00 spent, I left empty, somewhat sad, and wanted to leave Las Vegas behind in my rear view mirror.  This place is not for me.",

    "text": "We came on a Sunday night before O and the view was beautiful! If you sit on the patio, you'll get a front row seat to the Fountains at Bellagio. We watched the sunset while the Fountains went off every half hour until 8 and then every 15 minutes after 8. I wasn't hungry and a little nauseous and there were only two options on the menu. The smaller of the two options had two appetizers, an entree and a dessert for $115. I wasn't feeling well or hungry enough to eat that much so I asked our waiter if I could just have a salad. Our meal came with an amuse bouche with potato soup and something fried, bread, and butter with Picasso printed on it. All the appetizers were yummy. The salad was expensive at $22 but it was good.   My sister had the four course meal and I tried a little bite of everything and it was delicious! The courses were small. The fish appetizer with cauliflower mashed potatoes was buttery, flaky, and delicious. The pigeon was my favorite entree. I've had pigeon in Chinatown but this one was so much more flavorful and tender! The veal chop was fatty and delicious as well but I liked the pigeon better. The desserts tasted like your typical desserts. I didn't order a dessert but I had some birthday petite fours which were pretty tasty. The best part of this restaurant is the view and the Picasso art inside. The food is delicious but the price can be a little off-putting considering that the cheapest option on the menu for dinner was $115.",

Prior to Picasso it was Victoria and Albert's in Orlando, or Azul at the Mandarin Oriental in Miami. Well, now Picasso is one. And I've been looking for the \"Picasso\" of every new city I've visited since.   We had the tasting menu, which frankly started out strongest with poached oysters. Everything else was also amazing, but the oysters are the new comparison point. The ambience was divine and the wait staff was professional and approachable, with a healthy sense of humor.   In a meal like this, I hope the details escape me. And they do, because I sat there giddy like a schoolgirl the whole time, hoping it wouldn't end. It ended, but I'll be back. In 5 or 10 years.",

    "text": "Picasso is the fifth Michelin restaurant that I've dined at in about a three week period. So my review may be skewed by comparisons to recent dinning experiences in Europe.   First, the service was ABSOLUTELY IMPECCABLE. I would give it all the stars in the world for the staff's excellent decorum and professionalism.   Two of us dined here, and we both had the prix fixe menu. First course - poached oysters with caviar, paired with a sauvignon blanc. I usually don't like cooked oysters, but this was great. The oysters were so plump and flavorful, after the first one I had forgotten they were cooked. Would definitely order it again.   Second course- we both ordered the ruby red shrimp. We both thought the shrimps were too pungent and had too much iodine flavor. I thought about sending it back to the kitchen actually, but couldn't do it.  Main course- I had the fallow deer medallions, with a Spanish red. This dish was good, though not sure if apples were the most appropriate pairing. It was just a little too sweet to be balancing the deer meat.   Last course: the dessert was fine--nothing amazing but I'm not big on desserts. Though I found it a bit unusual they didn't offer a dessert wine pairing.   The food was good, and we had a wonderful evening, but I still wonder what the Michelin reviewers had to merit a 2-star award for Picasso. I'm guessing reviewers probably had the more expensive degustation menu or the special seasonal menu. Be that as it may, the kitchen should still strive to have the same level of precision throughout all tiers of its menus.  Food aside, the restaurant is lovely, being on the lakeside of the Bellagio and where else can you dine with millions of dollars worth of Picasso artwork? For those interested in looking at the art more closely, ask for a catalog or tour of the art around the restaurant.",

The saddest part was that we indicated, on the reservation , that it was for my birthday and no aknowledgement of it was made. We did not expect anything special but just ONE candle with the desert and a kind word such as \"happy birthday, we're happy you could celebrate this with us\" would have been perfect. Is that too much  to expect? or too complicated ?? Humm !! I wonder ! Guess what ? Next time we'll try somewhere else .",

Deeply Underwhelming. Food was the low point. How the heck can this place have two Michelin stars???  Based on reading the other reviews I had high hopes and expectations. Can't fathom how other reviewers and us ate at the same restaurant.  We've eaten the best in Vegas, in the US and some places in the world. Our perspective is defined from experience. With that said the food was ok at best and flavorless and poorly cooked at worst. The Amuse Bouche fried thing was just nasty, greasy, gooey. Scallop was on mashed potatoes and gravy and a potato chip, mash was good but what a weird pairing. The lobster salad was tough meat and flavorless. Foie was probably best of the night but nothing special. Lamb was just nasty- TOUGH, thin vein of silverskin and cool gristle, no flavor. Veg on the plate were flavorless. Wife's poached oyster was good. Ruby red shrimp flavorless. Black Sea Bass flavorless other than some fishy taste. Skin was not crispy. Veg, flavorless.  Dessert, again, \"ok' and nothing special.  Cocktails were ok, one of mine was served with a wet stem which then got stickier and stickier which was not enjoyable.   Service was very good, waiter and waitstaff friendly and efficient.  Ambiance was probably the high point, it's very upscale and elegant. View of fountains from patio was great.  To read it is claimed this restaurant has not one but two Michelin stars BOGGLES MY MIND. There are several LV restaurants we've been to, at same or lower price-point which were far, FAR better than Picasso. I definitely left feeling like I had thrown away $400.   Not sure what is going on in the kitchen but your \"chefs\" sure screwed this night up :-(",

My first time dining here was about 7 years ago, and this time would probably be my fourth time, but first time reviewing it...sigh!   I'm lucky to be able to fly on a private jet within 24 hours without dealing with LAX issues. Nevertheless, I decided to dine here while taking care of biz matters...multitask.   Had the concierge make reservations and was seated at a VIP booth with a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain. There are tables on the patio and by the window, however, evidently diners have complained about getting wet from the dancing fountains, and so I was glad the hostess was accommodating. The wine list was impressive, but I prefer french champagne and had the pre theater menu cuisine of: lobster, duck l'orange along with micro veggies. Both the lobster and the duck were in splendid sauces, quite delightful. All the dishes were exquisitely prepared and presented, just like art, just as it always been every time I dine here.   This restaurant and the cuisine and style reminds me of NYC's Le Cirque and I am so glad it is still here, I love elegant classy dining experiences, and Picasso is.  Speaking of art, the restaurant exhibited numerous paintings on all the walls. The most prominent and priciest is the self portrait of Picasso which was acquired for over $48.5 million  in 2006, and is probably worth more now. I am amazed that something that valuable is just on the wall of this restaurant...but I suppose it's insured, of course!  The restaurant is elegant in decor, lovely ambiance but lighting was dim, which was romantic but didn't help with pics.  Perhaps the dim light helps preserve the artwork on all the walls. The Bellagio Hotel has been on the Las Vegas strip for decades and it is known for the Bellagio Gallery of art collection. Exhibition is open to the public and I highly recommend the art gallery as well as Picasso Restaurant.",

The service was impeccable, the room is beautiful (of course), and the food was pretty reasonably priced, considering the quality.  I didn't love all the dishes (in fact, for me, the foie gras was a bit too rich and I was not a fan of the deer), but I appreciate the quality of the preparation, the presentation, and the overall experience.    At this point in my dining life, I have been lucky enough to enjoy many dishes at Michelin-starred restaurants (who knows if Picasso would still earn the stars, as Vegas doesn't merit the stars anymore; just like LA, like we don't have awesome food...stupid!). Usually, I'm more interested in finding the whole in the wall, authentic spot, rather than the pricey, upscale, fine dining spot.  That being said, if you're looking for a special occasion meal and are interested in dining in the presence of multi-million dollar pieces of art, then Picasso is the spot for you.  The soups are pretty strong, the scallops are delicious, and the lamb was very tasty.  I wasn't thrilled with the desserts, which works out well for me, honestly, lol, but it was surprising that they weren't better.  Between the three of us, I figured we would have ordered something delicious.  Even with my seemingly conflicting review, Picasso is a spot I would recommend, for a specific type of meal.",

    "text": "Quite simply, Picasso was one of the best dinners of my life. We had an exceptional dinner that was remarkable from start to finish. The service was excellent throughout and while the pacing of the courses was on the slower side, we had no complaints as it allowed us to enjoy the experience all the more. The decor was elegant and with several real Picasso paintings adorning the walls, it was a beautiful space in which to have a wonderful dinner. Additionally, as far as views in Las Vegas go, the front-row seating for the Bellagio fountain show made for an incredible ambiance throughout our meal.  I ordered from the Menu Degustation and had an excellent experience. Starting with the amuse bouche -- which on this night happened to be a \"Pheasant Croquette\" -- the experience was phenomenal. The croquette was incredibly prepared, crispy on the outside, but immediately gave way to a soft, cheesy and melty center. This was a wonderful surprise for our first taste of the night and was up there with some of the best bites of food I've ever experienced.   From there we moved to the first course which was \"Maine Lobster Salad\" which was served cool and was quite tasty. The lobster was well prepared but not overly modified letting the quality of the lobster and its preparation speak for itself.  The next course this evening was the \"Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras\". This came out with a nice accompaniment of brioche that worked really well with the deliciously decadent foie gras. This was undoubtedly some of the best foie gras I have ever had and was prepared exquisitely. The flavor was both strong and subtle against the texture provided by the brioche. This was not only one of my favorite dishes of the night but of our entire stay in Vegas.  Following next was the \"Pan Seared U-10 Day Boat Scallop\" which was cooked to perfection. Once again, this dish was elevated by the texture juxtaposition between the tender and delicate scallop mixed with the provided crispy and crunchy cracker and the potato mousseline mixture below.  For the main course, I chose the \"Sauteed Filet Of Halibut\". The fish was once again expertly prepared and flaked away easily beneath the fork. The hollandaise was light but flavorful and the asparagus was cooked very well. The flavors here worked really well together and it was overall a very enjoyable main course if not quite as exhilarating as some of the previous courses.  Finally, for the dessert course, the chef chose a combination of ice cream, pastry, and berries that was simply divine. The flavor and texture profiles of the chosen items worked flawlessly together and made for an incredibly satisfying conclusion to the evening.  If you're at all on the fence about this place, go for it. This was the best meal of our trip to Vegas and one of the best meals of my life. We will most certainly be returning on a future visit to Vegas.",

The interior is very beautifully detailed from ceiling to floor, a lovely departure from strip-gaudy.   The food is excellent. Very well executed in both presentation and taste. French with some Spanish inspiration. More traditional than experimental.   Two menus were offered, a 4-course Degustation and a 3-course pre-fixe. I couldn't decide which one to go with for I was drawn to the degustation appetizers and the pre-fixe main course choices. I literally did eenie meenie miney mo and decided on the degustation. The lobster salad was light and refreshing. I'm normally not the biggest fan of lobster but I greatly enjoyed this dish. The scallop was perfectly cooked and   The service is wonderful. I believe my main server's name was Max, HE was the highlight of the evening. Everyone who provided me service was warm and attentive.  Picasso is a great place for a quiet, quality dinner with a beautiful view.",

I greatly enjoyed my meal at Picasso. I did the five course tasting menu, and subbed in the Scottish Salmon for the Foie Gras, and it was delicious top to bottom. The salmon, which was perfectly cooked in an absolutely mouthwatering sauce, and the Hazelnut Opera Cake were particular standouts. Picasso is pricey, but worth it, unlike some other restaurants on the strip with equally expensive menus and much less to show for it. I highly recommend it.",

    "text": "Of all the incredible restaurants in Vegas, the Picasso still stands out above the rest. Everything others have said is so True. The food is delectable, the service is phenomenal, and the view is unparalleled.   FOOD: We each had the prix fixe meal (4 courses, including dessert). Between two people we had the poached oysters and quail salad for our first course, foie gras and asparagus for the second course, the deer and veal chop for the main course, and molten chocolate cake and the hazelnut opera cake for dessert. Clear standouts were the poached oysters and the deer! The deer is incredible - not gamey in the slightest. To be honest it tasted like the best steak I'd ever had! The accoutrements with the deer were fairly subpar, to be honest, but the meat more than made up for it! Both desserts were also incredible. You're also given an amuse bouche (croquette with soup shooter) and a goodbye gift (banana muffins).   DRINKS: We opted for cocktails, and over the course of dinner had The Blue Period, The Last Word, and the Bramble. All were excellent! And we were very easily able to order a drink at the bar when we first arrived, and transfer it seamlessly to our table.   ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is very intimate! It's perfect for a couple (very romantic), but we were seated by a larger group which was also fine. Service and view are both phenomenal! I recommend asking for an indoor table right by the windows - you still get an excellent view of the fountains and get to enjoy the ambience inside.   The Picasso is definitely a splurge, but a well worth one! I have no complaints about the meal, except perhaps that the food was all far too good, and I walked out stuffed!",

    "text": "What am I going to tell you that the Michelin Guide hasn't already?   This isn't a dinner. It isn't a meal. It isn't food for the sake of nutrition and fuel. This is an experience that you will only find yourself having if you've sought it out, and should therefore already understand what you're in for.    Even so- your preconceived notions will be incorrect. They'll be turned upside down and you'll be left wondering if what you think happened really occurred, or if it was all some kind of crazy dream.   Our meal at Picasso was nothing short of phenomenal. We enjoyed the chef's degustation menu, which on the night we dined began with a lobster salad. That may sound like something you've had before, but that's kinda the point here. Sure- you've had all of this before, but never like this. This salad had a perfect balance of creaminess and acidity to complement the most perfectly cooked lobster you've ever had, and has an accompanying \"citrus dust\" that takes it over the top.   Our second course was the most perfectly seared scallop I've ever encountered. It was served on a cloud of potato puree that seemed to be a 50/50 potato:butter mixture. Well- maybe 40/60. That would've been decadent enough, but rimming the bowl was a jus, that when combined with the potatoes created a literal bomb of flavor. A crisped slice of potato added just the right texture, and Picasso's staff are smart enough to serve this dish with a saucier spoon to save you the indignity of licking the bowl to extract every molecule of puree and sauce.   Next we enjoyed a seared/sauteed loin of foie gras with a cherries and a cherry ganache. Generally speaking, I am not a favor of sweet flavors making incursions into savory dishes. I am wrong- at least where it concerns Chef Serrano and his staff. There was definitely a sweetness to this dish, but it was such a considered, composed, and balanced dish. There was acidity, and so much umami from the exquisitely cooked foie that I just couldn't stop eating. Along with a perfectly cooked almond biscotti for some crunch, I can't think of any way this dish could be improved. Despite a conscious effort to savor and enjoy this dish, it was gone far more quickly than I was ready for it to be.   This is also the perfect place to explain exactly why it's worth paying for the wine pairings at Picasso. Our sommelier, Douglas, paired this dish with a Sancerre. Given my dislike of sweet wines that exceeds my general distaste for sweet/savory combos, I was hesitant to say the least. Again, I was wrong. Douglas chose a wine that held up beautifully against the richness of the foie, and somehow contrasted the sweetness of the dish while still being sweet itself. This is one of those moments where I'm again unsure of what exactly happened. It shouldn't have worked, but it did. Douglas is a somm who knows exactly what he's doing, and I'm sure he's going to smoke his master exam in a few months.   Our mains arrived with similar care. My Colorado lamb loin was cooked perfectly, but believe it or not, the vegetables served alongside were actually my favorite part. The spring vegetable medley were cooked to *just* the perfect point. Al dente is probably an incorrect term here, but it's the closest thing I have here. I'm from the south, so I like my vegetables cooked, but nobody likes mushy beans. These had the exactly correct amount of time on the heat, and I'd give anything to learn to recreate it. My wife's halibut dish was perfect to my mind, but she felt like it may have been just a tad over cooked.   Dessert was also worth the investment. My dessert was essentially a fancy chocolate lava cake, but what a difference fancy makes. Paired with a raspberry sorbet and a raspberry sauce with some delicate sugar work as a garnish, I found myself once again considering licking the plate. As I hadn't been furnished with another saucier spoon, I went ahead and made do with a spare finger.   To say the very least, this was an incredible experience for our first Michelin-starred meal. I haven't even mentioned the decor, (of Picasso's) the ambiance, (several hours of the very best views of Bellagio's famous fountains) or the amuse-bouche of an incredible chilled potato and garlic soup with a crisp and warm croquette. I didn't get a chance to mention our amazing head waiter Mac, or the rest of his team. I haven't had room to discuss the EXCELLENT cocktails we got to enjoy before our dinner even began...  You will pay at Picasso. You will pay a lot. And you will walk out gloriously happy that you did.",

    "text": "Having tried his tapas spot at Lago, time to move up to the chain and try Julian Serrano's Picasso, since it's been on my list for a few years.  I had a choice between indoor and outdoor seating. Chose outdoors for the views, you get the fountains right in your face. Just don't go on a windy night, because the wind will blow the fountain water towards your face. It's not like Splash Mountain status, but it makes it much colder. Indoor is also an intimate environment, you are literally in a mini art museum, and art museums generally tell you no food or beverage is allowed.   Service was good. I was expecting them to explain each dish a bit more than telling me my first course or second course. Sommelier was very detailed, in contrast. I was able to learn more about old world wines that came with the wine pairing.   Food presentation was gorgeous. I was expecting something more experimental. My menu degustation tasted great, but I wasn't intrigued. I'm a bit biased here, since I just dined at Twist the night before, and that dinner left me speechless, nothing but a wide grin. That had set a higher bar for Picasso to surpass. Let's say if you want something very traditional with a gorgeous surrounding, come and dine here. And if you do, don't time your reservation too close to Le Cirque or to Twist.",

    "text": "WOW.  I could probably end my review of Picasso right there with that one statement of a word. But... let's get some more food-porn style descriptions going!  Since I came with a partner in crime, we each ordered a different menu (one Prix Fixe and one Menu Degustation) and decided to share and conquer.    First dish to come out was a lovely amuse bouche of a fried potato croquette with serrano ham and smoked red pepper soup.  Everything went together perfectly... the crispy, sweet potato croquette combined with the smoky, salty serrano all dipped in the sweet, deep red pepper soup.  Great start!  Next came the appetizer dishes.    The Maine Lobster Salad was light and refreshing and a perfect start.  The acidity of the vinaigrette allowed the briny sweetness of the lobster to shine.    The Pan Seared Scallop was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of sear on the outside and fork-tender inside,  all accompanied by delicious whipped potatoes, a Parmesan chip and a rich sauce.    The Sauteed Ruby Red Shrimp was cooked just to the verge of doneness, so that it retained a lot of natural flavor and crunch.  Accompanying it was a delicious Piquillo Pepper Vinaigrette and tomato confit.    The Sauteed Foie Gras Steak was butter... and the peach sauce complemented the richness of the foie gras extremely, helping to cut down on the heaviness of it.  The highlight of the appetizers (not to take anything away from all of those listed above because they would put most other restaurants to shame) was the Poached Oysters.  OH MY LORDY!  The oyster was perfectly poached.  The buttery vermouth sauce, combined with the briny caviar and a splash of lemon for acidity... its like \"sex in the mouth\" (sorry I was just watching Top Chef and that phrase was used).  If I had to die tomorrow, this would be one of the things I would request to eat in my top 5.  Finally, the mains.  The Halibut Fillet was again, cooked perfectly (it's getting boring I know).  The outside had a nice crisp while the inside was perfectly flaky.  The rich Hollandaise sauce was a perfect compliment to the light flavor of the fish.  The Milk-Fed Veal Chop was delicate (weird word to describe beef, I know).  The veal was tender and a perfect perfect medium rare.  What else is there to say?  So after all of this, the desserts came.... and both the Chocolate Truffle Beignets and Berry Buttermilk Cake are awesome (sorry, exhausted from writing the above so no more detail here).  So okay, enough of my ode to Picasso.  If you have to have a fancy meal in Vegas, go here!",

    "text": "An exquisite dining experience with a menu flow that will elevate your taste buds higher than the Bellagio fountains right beside your table.  Picasso was highly recommended restaurant by my 2nd cousin who was a past sous chef at this Julian Serrano establishment along with a fellow foodie with an extensive dining resume.  The dining experience is nothing short of extraordinary from the precisely cooked proteins to the breath taking atmosphere.  I have an intrinsic desire to customize my dining experience when I dine out.  From basic culinary derivatives to more advanced, I like to change things up and try new things.  The wait service at Piccasso is very accommodating with my custom order.  I went with the Menu Degustation as a base and added selections that appeals to my appetite from the Prix Fixe.  I came up with the Maine Lobster Salad, Poached Oysters, Pan Seared U10  Scallops, Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras, Roasted Milk-Fed Veal Chop, and Summer Sorbet Selection.    I paired the Lobster Salad, Oysters, and Scallops with a nice Pinot Grigio that was refreshing and highlighted the outstanding nature of the seafood introductory trio.     Maine Lobster Salad was great on a warm gentle summer night with it's refreshing culmination of melons, succulent lobster pieces, small peppercorns, and heirloom sweet tomatoes.  The apple champagne vinaigrette was well made and really tied all the salad components together.    Poached Oysters were absolutely phenomenal.  Perfectly prepared and poached in a sweet vermouth that was not overpowering as one may believe prior to throwing them back.  It beats vinegar.  A light squeeze of lemon and the Osetra caviar bits were an excellent touch that really puts these oysters on a higher echelon.      Pan Seared Day Boat U10 Scallops were immaculately cooked to perfection.  Very impressed.  While U10 Scallops are one of my favorite seafood proteins to cook at home, Julian Serrano's team did a great job of perfectly cooking it which really puts my culinary skills to shame.  The Jus de Veau and Potato Mousseline were confirmation of Michelin star quality potato preparation.  The thinly sliced potato chip was an excellent crunchy parallel with the single scallop that were succulent juicy and seasoned just right.    Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras was one of the best Foie Gras I've had.  So decadent and eye lid closing pleasurable, it could be the convincing evidence to repeal California's ridiculous Foie Gras ban.  The dry crunchy almonds went nice with the Foie Gras steak as the grease was off set with the dryness of the prime almonds.  Rhubarb Puree and Blood Orange Sauce was reduced and made well not to overwhelm the diner and have the star of the show (Foie Gras) prevail.  The Foie Gras was an excellent cut and sauteed so it melts in your mouth.  The cherries worked very well with the dish and were pitted.  The sweet and savory elements worked well with a crusted bread that soaked up the flavor of the Foie Gras steak.    The main course of Roasted Milk-Fed Bone-In Veal Chop was highly recommended and I now know why.  The veal chop was a prime cut of only the best part of the calf.  It was perfectly trimmed and roasted in a rosemary + salt and pepper with a good amount of carmelization that encrusted the meat.  This demonstrates the high level of cooking skill because it was roasted at an extremely high temperature with such precision.  A rich au jus reduction sauce was brought out and applied in spoon fulls over the meat.  This added a beautiful flavor to the meat that made it so juicy and burst with flavor on the tongue.  A rosemary mashed potato concoction was a necessary that is a must with amazing beef.  While one was mashed, the other was slow cooked potatoes in whole form that were a bit soggy and under cooked.  Micro-greens were added to the presentation. Passed on the spicy horseradish.  Summer Sorbet Selection Trio.  It was 3 scoops of sorbet with candy pop rocks scattered underneath the sorbets.  The velvet texture of the sorbet and the hard sharp consistency and sweet explosions were very enjoyable to complete the meal.  3 flavors: Grape, Strawberry, and Coconut.  The Grape was the best and really encapsulated grape flavor without being too artificial tasting.  It was outstanding and I highly recommend it.  The Strawberry lacked distinctive flavor.  Amuse: potato croquette with chilled potato leek soup. Dessert tray: nougat, chocolate truffle, cream puff, and fruit gel.  Atmosphere: It's a trip to dine in the best front & center position of the fountains.  It's another experience watching it closer and on a private deck vs the public area off Las Vegas Blvd.  It was quite a memorable experience watching the fountains cascade and shoot overhead after dinner with good company.  While dining it's great to recreate an Ocean's 11 scene and be mesmerized by Picasso originals.    I couldn't stop staring during dinner and got lost in Picasso...",

First off all the place had 2 Michelin Stars, if I read the sign near the entrance correctly, that's 2 more stars than any restaurant I've ever eaten at.  Ordering was pretty simple, you choose from 3-4 different menus I forget how many exactly, it's been a month since I ate there.  Overall the food was great.  The lobster app was delicious as was the scallop course.  I had the fish and the wife had the wagyu.   Lots of Picasso's all around, so maybe the guys in Ocean's Eleven should have heisted the paintings instead of robbing the vault of the MGM (that's the plot for the next sequel, pay me money George Clooney).  Overall a fine dining experience possibly worth the price... possibly.",

    "text": "Forgive me Yelp God! It has been months since my last review...  My boyfriend and I came to Picasso on a whim..I know I seem to start all my Yelp reviews with this sentence, but what can I say, I am quite impulsive.  We were immediately drawn to the menu and thought it was the most approachable of the Michelin starred restaurants in Las Vegas (this was considering we were dining at Robuchon two days later).   I must comment that we were both skeptical about Las Vegas Michelin starred restaurants, considering that we had yet to have a dining experience that could meet our vaulted expectations.  I have to say that everything here was absolute perfection.  The service was charming, sincere, eloquent, professional, and quite refreshing.  The sommelier was excellent, poured some exceptional wine pairings, and even challenged my certified somm. boyfriend a bit.  The food was well balanced, executed beautifully and was absolutely on par with what I expect two michelin star cuisine to be.  In all honesty, I  had only ONE problem the entire evening, just one, It's just a pet peeve of mine.  The butter was not room temperature, it needed to be tempered more.  That's it.    I had an amazing evening, with an amazing companion.  I cannot wait to come back and do it all again.   5 glorious stars!",

    "text": "This is my \"100th\" review on yelp ,and I would like to write about Picasso! Because it's a such special restaurant which truly wins 5 stars on my yelp book. I came here with my husband to celebrate my birthday. As soon as I walked in, I fell in love with romance and beauty of flower decoration and view of Bellagio fountain. Our waiter told me Picasso spent $40k every month on these fresh elegant flowers! Picasso only offers prefixed menu. ( no a la carte) I had winter truffle tasting menu ($250), and my husband had tasting menu ($135). Omg! I was really blew away how awesome our food was. Every single bite of my truffle dishes wowed me. My mouth was full of truffle aroma after each bite. I've never had so much truffle in one meal before. Lamb chop and seared foie gras from my husband's tasting menu were cooked \"perfectly\"! (in flavor n presentation) However, desserts here were kind of weak. I was expecting better from 2 star Michelin restaurant. Our waiter was really really friendly and knowledgeable. He noticed I had iphone and professional camera on my table since we seated. He asked me if I would like to get pictures with my hubby. I told him we are here to celebrate bday and it would be great. Our waiter insisted to take my profession camera and took pictures from all different angles in main dinning room for us. He also told me Picasso is very picture friendly. I can feel free to take picture with any art masterpiece of Picasso on my way out. I had such wonderful night here. Thank you Picasso for making my night so special!!!",

    "text": "After trying Picasso, it was immediately clear why it wasn't given an updated Michelin rating from 2009.  From my experience, there's very little to justify even a single Michelin star for Picasso.  Then again, Vegas has that effect on people, distorting reality so much as to convince the Michelin tasters in 2009 and current diners that this Julian Serrano restaurant actually deserved two Michelin stars.  First of all, I don't count myself amongst the fine-dining elite, having only recently sampled about a handful of one-Michelin star restaurants, mostly in the Bay Area, one in Chicago and one in LA.  To me, restaurants of this caliber offer similarly refined foods, mostly differentiating themselves by service and ambiance.    We went to Picasso for our anniversary, which was apparently a major source of patronage besides the obligatory hot date in Vegas.  We arrived for our reservation at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and the hostess, without even looking up, instructed us to wait.  Briefly stunned, I settled into the lounge with two other couples in similar straits.  A Wednesday night besides, I've never had to wait at any Michelin-rated restaurant, especially when I've made a reservation.    After 20 awkward minutes, we were taken to our seat on the far wall.  Along the way, I noticed plenty of empty tables, so our wait was even more disquieting.  Almost immediately, we sensed our dinner would proceed at a languorous pace; we marked time with the Bellagio water spectacle outside the windows that started every 15 minutes.  The first three shows were welcomed delights, but soon they became distractions.    As the other couples from the lounge sat down next to us, we noticed a distinct lack of privacy.  We were barely two feet apart and in that quiet space, it was way too easy to participate in each other's private conversation.  We all ended up eating in uncomfortable silence.    The tasting menu was misleading.  I've seen other tasting menus encompass a broad range of taste experiences, numbering up to 10 or more.  At Picasso, there are just two pricy options: Prix Fixe for $113 and Degustation for $123.  Both are more properly described as dinner settings since they came with soup or salad as appetizer, a second sampler plate, a main course, and a dessert.    My wife ordered a cocktail to pass the time, while I got a tea service to soothe my dry throat.  Apparently, Picasso is not the place to order cocktails as my wife's cocktail came out so unpleasantly bitter that she actually had to return it after a second confirming sip.  It was the very first time she's ever had to do that.  At $14 per cocktail, it's perfectly understandable, since I expected nothing less than amazing.  The replacement was passable.    As each well-presented but tiny portion of food came, I accompanied them all with the much needed but unsatisfactory bread.  The entrees were all uniformly moist and juicy, but I found them to be quite bland and uninspired.  The antelope I had was the juiciest piece of game meat I've ever had.  Yet, it was as forgettable as the rest of the meal, except for perhaps the slab of cold foie gras that was dressed up as an entree, a singularly disagreeable and unsettling experience.  To celebrate our anniversary, our desserts were decorated with chocolate script.  While we always appreciate the thought, the piping work looked rushed and crude, with the letters barely recognizable.  By contrast, the chocolate script we had at the one-starred Plumed Horse was a beautiful work of a real artisan.  Service was as polished as expected at other fine-dining establishments in the Bay Area.  But, towards the end of the meal, we felt neglected as we saw neither our waiter nor any bus boys for over 30 minutes.  We ran out of water and sat dejected.    About the only element in Picasso's favor is its selection of original Picasso paintings decorating the walls of the restaurant.  I studied the two in front of me for a solid hour and started to grasp something of Picasso's artistic vision.  If I were a True aficionado or student of Picasso's works, I might find the rare opportunity to be worth the price of admission.  After three hours and a numbing procession of the Bellagio water spectacle, we tabbed out at $305 for two, including tip.  This was the first time I felt like I wasted money for a fine dining experience.  At most, the experience at Picasso was worth $150 for two, including drinks and tip.  A Michelin-rated experience, it certainly was not.    As we left, the hostess once again told us good night without looking up.  Maybe I'm part of the invisible ethnicity in America, but that really made me feel non-existent.  Then, as if noticing a slight, the manager got the hostess to give us something of a parting gift.  Emblazoned with the Picasso logo, we found inside two small, greasy palmiers, instead of some sweets.  It was one last mis-fire that captured the whole Picasso experience.",

    "text": "Picasso (not the painter) restaurant in Las Vegas is an absolute embarrassment to the Michelin star rating system.  I would bet the farm that Bellagio paid the Michelin inspectors a large sum of money to get their 2 stars.  Picasso does not merit even 1/16 of a star compared to some of the Michelin star restaurants I have had the pleasure to dine in LA, SF, NYC, Paris, Barcelona, and London.     My wife brought me here for my birthday and I was looking forward in experiencing their desgustation menu.  The pan-seared scallops tasted like if they were from the same kitchen making the scallop salad for room service....Very dry and bland in flavor.  The halibut was dry and lacked any flaky texture.  The lamb had no flavor whatsoever.  I even forgot what I had for dessert.    I will admit that the service was very good.  The waiters were attentive and stirred up good conversation with us.  The actual Picasso paintings were beautiful and i really enjoyed viewing them.  I come to Vegas a lot, so the Bellagio fountains don't really thrill me anymore.  However, I can see how most people would find this to be interesting for their dining experience.    If you have experienced at least a 1 Michelin star restaurant, Picasso will disappoint you.  I would avoid this restaurant at all costs and use your money for the tables instead.  I will never dine here again or let any of my family or friends dare make a reservation at Picasso.",

We sat outside right next to the dancing waters of the Bellagio.  It was a magical place.  My husband and I ordered each of the prix fixe (5 course and 3 course) dinners along with the wine pairings.  The service was flawless and I felt like a princess.  Now the food was not as spectacular.  The foie gras was not delicious like how I've had it in other places.  My lamb was bland and heavy.  My husband's poached oysters were a memorable delight.  It was our first time to have it prepared in that manner.  The desserts were meticulously personalized with our celebrations written on the plate.  The white wines were delicious but the reds  were not the sommelier's strength for this meal.  The cream sherry was not good. They did give me a care package of cookies in a beautiful box.  overall, I loved the place and maybe the next time the food will be better.",

Happy birthday was scrawled on my dessert plate and all the dishes were hot and tasty despite the mad rush in the kitchen (I am sure).  Our main server, Robert, the French Robert was amazing and timed all our dishes perfectly.  We also had time to take photos of the million dollar artwork and was initially bummed we were not seated outside on the patio (inside with a great view) for the fountain show until we dashed outside for photos and were consistently sprayed on by the residual mist.  Would go back for leisurely dinner and try the patio seating again.  Kissed Robert on the cheeks for his great service.  Love French men.",

The wine pairing was very thoughtfully executed.  This is definitely a very nice place to go on a date or for a special occasion in the evening, and you have a wonderful view of the Bellagio's fountains if you get the right table. The reason for just 4 stars are the food and the price.  My friend hit the nail on the head when he said this restaurant's food had a certain \"generic luxury\" quality to it.  Maybe he's just been to too many similar places, but I've been to a few as well and tend to agree that some others are a little more interesting.  Another person who ate there told us in advance that they thought it was overpriced for the food itself and that you're just paying for the ambience, and that's pretty True, but in my opinion, the ambience is absolutely worth it for that special occasion.",

Each dish was great and the wine pairings were right on.  I liked how much information they gave you about the wine, but would have liked more description about the food.  The waitstaff was very though but a little cold at the start.  Didn't explain the menu until after we ordered.  The star was the scallop dish.  It was AMAZING.  My husband and I split up on the main coarse he had the fish and I had the lamb.  The lamb was the winner between the two and the wine pairing was one of my favorite wines.  I was sad to have to share.  The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the food offering for the price were not as extensive as other fine dining experiences we had had at Daniel in NY and Inn at Little Washington.   However the setting was over the top.   ENJOY!",

We've been always meaning to have dinner here, but felt it would be too much of a tourist trap, so finally we tried it.  I thought the main course and appetizers were better then deserts, but overall, we had a good experience and would certainly come again.. There're definitely other 5 star places in LV, slighly off the beaten path, but this restarant is definitely in the top 10 in my experience (for Vegas and taking the fact that Bellagio has TOn of foot traffic, tourists, etc, Picasso managed to not turn into a revolving door of just eaters.. if you know what i mean).",

DAMN!!!!  good thing i left some room for dessert.  also tasted the molten chocolate cake and rhubarb tart dessert which were excellent.  word of advice:  do what i did and have your parents or someone else who will pay take you to picasso.  if i had paid for myself i'd be evicted right now.",

Having a real chef (Julian Serrano, formerly of Masa's in SF) is what it takes for good cooking, not some celebrity who consults.  See L'Atelier de Joel Rubichon, for example.  Choke.  (I'm spoiled living in SF, where good ingredients at the local taqueria are de rigeur.)  I thought the meal was extraordinary, and accommodating.  (We had a big group flying in from San Francisco, and our reservations were for our first night, and our flight was very delayed.  But when we arrived, we had a fantastic table with views of the fountain, and it was a wonderful evening.   Very personal (down to the chef hanging out with us at the end), and I loved the service (a big point with me:  friendly, normal service is a good thing!  Icy condescension?  Not so good.)  I also thought the dining room was very agreeable.  I guess it's that guy Picasso.  He's pretty good.",

We went for our anniversary dinner, and husband explained the Michelin award to me and that Picasso was one of two Las Vegas recipients.  Everyone from the host/hostess, possibly the chef          (? when we first walked in) to the wait staff from the minute we walked in were SO friendly and attentive. There were beautiful Picasso pieces up along the walls of the restaurant.  And our meal was preceeded by the awesome water show right outside the terrace of the restaurant, with a view of Paris and other Vegas strip hotels in the background. I snuck my blackberry out every now and then so I could document EVERYTHING we were eating, because we're such foodies.  We both had prix fixe menus along with some Tikal Malbec.  Our notable favorites were the \"Chef's Welcome\": pheasant croquettes with a shot of roasted red pepper bisque, poached oysters w/caviar in vermouth sauce, medallions of fallow deer, lobster salad, pan-seared scallops in veal reduction and calvados crepe coin purse dessert. The service was eggcellent, and I enjoyed every bit of the meal.  It is the best meal I've had in my life thus far. Overstatement? Nah.",

I think the difference between the best and the rest is magic...something about the food, the service, the atmosphere that makes it an experience.  Something was missing here- the food was very good, the atmosphere was beautiful with the Bellagio fountains outside and the Picasso's, the service was really good.  The staff was relaxed but still professional, the busers were the stars responding to needs before I realized.  But if I was in Vegas for a special meal I would spend the extra money and go to Joel Robuchon at the MGM.  Can't get in there- then Picasso is a great second option.  Both offer veggie tasting menu's and cater to all kinds of can't eat issues like dairy, nuts, etc.  You can request a table by the window and really enjoy the fountain show that runs all night.",

We opted for the wine pairings which added a healthy price tag, but were totally worth it. We drank a wine that had been in production since the time of Christ. That's cool enough, but what was best was our French waiter. When you see a cartoon there's always a French waiter. This guy was the best waiter ever. At no point did he retrieve information about the food. Everything was committed to memory. So you're thinking, well, yeah, its a Prix Fixe, it doesn't change. I'd agree. However, we asked a lot of questions, being foodies and he was a wealth of knowledge with the perfect accent and mustache. Our meal was beautiful and delicious. Smoked salmon with quail egg on a cracker paired with a beautiful wine for a first course. A lovely frisee salad. I left Picasso drunk on amazing wine with a palate swooning for more and took my seat at Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" only to debate which was better, the dinner, or the show?",

First off was the courtesy of the chef; your welcoming tasting...that was delicious. then came the lobster salad!! that was great too!!..at this point, i was hyped on what I was going to get. Then came the seared scallops that you can totally figure out how to make on your own by watching some youtube chef make it! their foie gras was really rich and was done nothing to make it special side from the unique name for duck/goose liver-it was seared! then my turbot that tasted really bland, but looked complicated. I didn't know what to think about that. and last was the dessert, I don't know whether or not I read it wrong, but the description doesn't taste anything like what I ate. It was sweet, refreshing, but at the same time off tasting! so, not only do I think this place is overpriced, but it's really not worth it.",

If you sit outside you get a full view of the fountain show, however be aware smoking is allowed outside!!!  The food was pretty good. I loved the quail and she loved the asparagus and deer! The desserts were so divine! Great place to celebrate your anniversary:)",

Not only do they have 2 Michelin stars, they also offer the most affordable set menu of all the ones we found (and actually had food options that we were really interested in).  When we arrived, we were seated almost right away at our table. I didn't really notice until my husband pointed out the fact that all the paintings on the wall were real Picasso's (!), and the ambiance in the whole dining area was very nice and feels very intimate. You can actually see the Bellagio fountain show but you can't hear anything - how does that work? (ha ha!) Our server was great and his level of attentiveness was just right.  I picked the Prix Fixe menu that night while my husband went with the Degustation menu...I never know how people (he) can eat so much food but I actually thought my entree was a little small, ha ha! The food was spectacular and everything was well prepared and presented. At the end of the meal, they even gave us a box of complimentary baby madeleine cookies to take home!",

The views of the fountain can't be best Food: delicious! I had the 4 course pre-fixe, my husband had the seasonal truffle 5 course tasting and my mother in law had the regular tasting menu. Everything was savory, impeccably flavored and just so delicious. The foie gras is to die for and All of the truffle dishes were really superb.  Service : top notch, what you come to expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. I was observing them meticulously and I don't think any of the servers made a single error...which is really amazing since we each got a different tasting menu.  Price: appropriate for the caliber of the restaurant.  Would recommend wholeheartedly! Felicitaciones Chef Serrano!",

I think in the Bellagio, a huge tourist destination, you just can't provide the service and degree of excellence I am used to with such a \"splurge meal\". Overall I am disappointed that I can;t give this a 5* Yelp - but I have to tell you the truth - I expect the same from my fellow Yelper.  Service - good, not the best -when I say the best, I am expecting service similar to what I would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. I expect chair pulled, escort the the bathroom, attentiveness to each table need and whim. 2X we had wine WAY before meal and vice versa.   Food - fair to good, portions very small (I have been to some of the best restaurants in the country) I have never left a meal that I paid $500 for sober and not stuffed! The favs were anything in the saffron broth  & the scallop; lamb...meh, poorly seasoned, lacking flavor; earle grey cheesecake....meh;  the pineapple tart was very refreshing.  Wine - priced at 58/68$ per price fix was acceptable. No wine with dessert - not acceptable. The pouring and the sommeliers were good - selection of wine enhanced the chef's menu as expected.  Overall I would not recommend for you 1X splurge meal in Vegas. Now if you are a baller/high roller, go spend, spend, spend - you will enjoy it... :-)",

For $450. Since when does that go together? Who the fuck wants fancy rice? It was horrible. And out of respect for the chef I tried to eat it all... then comes the most bland fettuccine you have ever tasted. That's when I became highly fed up. No one even likes or understands the French so explain wtf you are serving people...",

However, the execution of the dishes is spectacular. I particularly enjoyed the braised short rib. Typically, i find this dish to be over seasoned and too sweet, but the nice vegetable wrap around the rib and the delicate savory sauce it's marinated in created the perfect bite. The portion sizes at this restaurant are typical for any french restaurant, which is tiny. If you are really hungry I don't recommend coming here(it makes quite a dent in the wallet). There are only 3 courses and bread, perfect for night of dancing but it won't hold you over till the next day. I would for sure come back!  Plus: The view is amazing from the balcony, I wish they had better quality heat lamps though they were called apart and looked like they would topple.",

    "text": "Valentine's Day 2019... babes does it again and snags 7pm reservations to surprise me! Our 2nd Valentine's Day together. :-)   You have to go down an escalator to get there. It seems like a secret hideaway. The ambiance of the entryway will definitely catch your eye. And the hostess at the front desk greeted us with a smile.   Since our reservation was early on, she gave us the option to dine inside or outside. It was cold out but there were heaters so she'd let me \"feel it out\" and if I didn't like it we could come inside. We were the first table from the water and let me tell you, it was a gorgeous view and one that I couldn't turn down. The heaters did keep us warm as I took my heavy coat off during dinner!   Service was definitely amazing. From the bread and butter to the appetizers and entrees, to the sweet desserts, every moment of this night was magical. Nothing beats having dinner next to the fountains of Bellagio and to awesome music.  If you're looking for something fancy and an experience you'll never forget, take your loved ones here. :-)",

    "text": "For my first 2 star Michelin restaurant I was very excited to try Picaso. We came here around 7pm on a Saturday night and were seated near the fountains which is a great view! The restaurant has really nice decor including real picaso paintings which is really unique. Everyone at my table did the pre-fixe menu with a wine pairing.   For starters we were given a chilled asparagus soup with a croquette which was very tasty. For my first course I got the whitefish,fava bean and corn soup which was very lovely but I would probably go with a different first course such as the oysters next time.  Followed by the shrimp second course with grilled zucchini and crispy artichoke. The shrimp was extremely tender and melted in your mouth. Most notably our main course of the lobster was fantastic! It was extremely flavorful came with a side of carrot puree and roasted vegetables. If that was one of the only lobster dishes I could eat again I would be very content. The dessert of warm chocolate fondunt was a tasty finish! I will note that I ordered a cappuccino to finish and it did arrive lukewarm/cold and was not to my liking.  The sommeliers here were incredibly knowledgeable and did a great job pairing our meals with wine. I would definitely recommend adding a wine pairing to your meal.   The service here is really what brings down their review. Our server Michael seemed somewhat condescending to our table. He seemed to look down upon us for not ordering drinks prior to our meal, and each time any of us had a questions/asked for suggestions regarding the menu. My fiance has a nut allergy and let him know and he seemed confused as to why he was letting him know... and didn't seem to take it very seriously.We had ordered still water with no ice and about halfway through the meal he switched us to tap water with ice. He overall wasn't very attentive.   It was a good meal overall but for the cost I wouldn't come back here.",

    "text": "So the two ladies at the front desk have Severe RBF. (Resting Bitch Face), in unison as we walked towards the desk they yelled at us \"Do you you have a reservations \" as if we wouldn't! Ha! I said yes it's under our last name, to their surprise!   Their attitude did not change, we were promptly seated in the patio as we requested in the reservation. We had a nice view of the Bellagio fountains, the waiter gave us the wine and drink menu. And the waiter was very pleasant and lovely, he made a few recommendations and right away new what i could order with my gluten-free problem.   First we ordered Libations, staying with the restaurants theme I had The Blue Period, this was a cucumber light vermouthy fresh drink it was topped with two tiny blue  flowers. Picasso's Blue Period was destinguished by a series of paintings in shades of blue and blue-green. So was this drink. Just lovely.  We were presented with an amuse-bouche of butternut squash soup and microgreens it was sweet and light just right.    I had the Menu Degustation, starting with the Maine Lobster Salad, its served like a tartar but warm, and it came with with a miniature romaine lettuce heart.   Then came the pan seared scallop, in a circle of pureed potato, that was scrumptious.  Then was the Foie Gras Steak in rhubarb puree, I don't know about this. I always feel guilty, the concept. I can't get my self to enjoy it. It was gelatinous, badness, sweetness, buttery, goodness I'm going to hell.   For the main course I had the Colorado Lamb. (So much for a conscience) it was pretty rare, the meat not my conscience.  It was seared on the outside but rare on the inside, just right.   Then dessert, I had the lava chocolate cake, with ice cream and slivered almonds, beyond decadent, loved it.   I liked my tasting but, I can see how this restaurant has lost its rating, it's not at the top of it's game. It has started to lag.  It has 2 Michelin stars and needs to act like it again!  On our way out the same two ladies gave us these lovely little boxes with sweets in them. Nice touch!!!",

    "text": "Went to Vegas for a brothers weekend and dined at Julian Serrano places twice. Julian Serrano Tapas (see my 5 star review!) at Aria and Picasso. I recommend both places but next time dining at this place, I should seek out other dishes.   I ordered your standard stay safe dishes and regretted it. I had a scallop dish and the scallop was cooked too long, but it's mashed potato puree saved this dish. The halibut was one big piece of fish and it was good, but wasn't blown away. I kick myself for not ordering the lamb instead. The  highlight of the night was the foie gras though. Yum.   Not all tables face the fountain when dining inside and for those poor souls who faces the wall, at least you can stare at the beautiful Picasso paintings. They should add a mirror on the back wall, so everyone can see the fountains, instead of hearing a loud boom every 15 minutes.   You don't have to wear suit or tie here. Business casual is fine and saw many people in jeans and very casual shirts.   Our food runner didn't know who ordered what dishes. It was like TGI Friday's type of service. I expected more from this place.   This place is a good value for a fine dining place that won't cost you and arm and a leg, so try something new here, like deer, or go big for the lobster that my brothers loved. They gave this place 5 stars.",

You get a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains, which add drama to the meal, and you are surrounded with Picasso originals.  You need to take the time and soak in the ambience.  The food itself is wonderful.  We went with the tasting menu.  Started with a lobster salad and it had a generous portion of lobster.  The dayboat scallops were perfect but the highlight was the foie gras steak.  A beautifullly prepared and large portion of foie gras.   The only issue is that it was so rich, I was not hungry for days.  For a main, I chose the halibut, which was also prepared wonderfully.  Dessert was also beautiful and excellent.  A great meal in an even better location.",

    "text": "If there ever was a way to celebrate a 10 year anniversary this would be it. From start to finish Picasso is truly a work of art!  Above anything I want to commend the staff for welcoming us with open arms and treating us like we belonged. They were all so friendly and really went out of their way effortlessly to make sure our celebration was spectacular. This will no doubt be a go to in Vegas bar none!  I've seen a lot of back and forth about dress code and all I can say is be respectful. I didn't see anyone in jeans, but seriously it's an upscale place so throw some slacks and a nice dress shirt on for one meal. I had dress slacks and a polo so business casual worked, but just run with it for a meal.  The meal for the wifey and I came just shy of $600 so by no means is this a spur of the moment excursion, but every bite is well worth EVERY penny. This has set the bar high for any and all meals which follow.  I went with the menu degustation and each course seemed to out do the other (6 to me, but the menu says otherwise). It began with a chef's take on a potato and leek soup paired with some jamon de bellota. I was impressed by the subtleness of the soup as even partnered with the ham it was creamy and nowhere near salty. Tres magnifique! Next I reeled in the Maine lobster salad. The lobster was super fresh and the creme fraiche vinaigrette was like a really frothy sour cream in a way, but gave the lobster such a different dimension. The flying fish caviar to me resembled bursting boba so the kid in me had fun popping these. It had a little tickle spice wise that oddly enough resembled lawry's seasoning, but definitely the best caviar I've had to date. I have no words to describe the pan seared U-10 day boat scallop. So much meat here and is by far my favorite of the scallop family. It was seared to perfection as it dissolved with ease in my mouth. On deck was the (banned in California) foie gras. It's always been a guilty pleasure despite the potent taste to it, but this again was amazingly sauteed and it tasted a bit nutty almost which partnered with the fig is one of those things that make you say hmmmmm. Now for the main course, I went all in and did the $150 upgrade for A5 grade Japanese Wagyu and this filet left me purring. I tuned out the glitz and glamor of the strip and the boom of the fountain during this course. No doubt this would be a last meal request as it cut with no effort. Arigatou to Japan is in full effect! If that wasn't enough you get a choice from their dessert menu which I wasn't expecting (figured I'd only get what was told to me) so I drove it home with the pineapple upsidedown cake (another of my go to's). OMG is about all I can say. An onslaught of buttery rich tropical goodness and I was blown away by the banana-coconut sorbet oozing all over it. This a is culinary experience done proper.  All in all I could not have pictured a better anniversary meal than my experience at Picasso. Perfect food, stellar staff, and impeccable romance all in the air. I left happy and I cannot wait to return for more from Chef Serrano and crew!",

    "text": "At this point in my life, I've seen nearly every manner of restaurant configuration and decor that is possible. Having so many dining experiences under my belt, perhaps I shouldn't be so impressed by Picasso, but I cannot help myself from gushing over Picasso's charming dining room with its vaulted ceilings and astonishing view of the Bellagio's dancing fountains. I certainly will not ever dine in another restaurant outfitted with original works from Pablo Picasso, including the \"Seated Man,\" a self-portrait painted in 1965 that overlooks the dining area, and the priceless \"Woman With Beret,\" one of Picasso's trademark distorted cubist figures created in 1938.  Of course, this is a restaurant in addition to an art exhibit, and James Beard-awarded \"Best Chef\" Julian Serrano is a rare celebrity chef who still does honest work for a living and can actually be found in Picasso's kitchen on most nights. I put myself at his mercy with the \"Menu Degustation\" and thoroughly enjoyed the ride.  My first bite of food was their phenomenal amuse bouche, a crispy \"Pheasant Croquette\" with delightful strips of prosciutto and a mushy filling of minced meat mixed with gooey melted cheese, accompanied by a nutty \"Chilled Potato and Leek Soup with Sliced Almonds\" that tasted like the essence of leeks amplified by a thousand.  My favorite course of the evening was the earthy \"Roasted Tenderloin of Colorado Lamb,\" seasoned perfectly, cloud-tender, and served on a scorching hot plate (think Ruth's Chris). I don't mean to undersell the plump \"U-10 Day Boat Scallops,\" seared to pick up a brown crust and then placed on top of a buttery potato mousseline surrounded by a glorious jus de veau gravy. And what kind of grand meal (outside of California) would this be without a foie gras course? Here, a \"Sauteed Foie Gras Steak\" is served with chocolate-stuffed Olson cherries in a silky green peppercorn sauce infused with more foie gras. The contrasting sweet, sour, savory, and spicy notes work to elevate this to a work of edible art congruent with the theme of the restaurant.  Service from my waiter was flawless, even if not as personalized as I've had in other Forbes 5-Star/AAA 5-Diamond spots. The supporting cast was excellent, however. The \"Bread Guy\" was perhaps the highlight, at one point scurrying out of the kitchen over to my table with agility and purpose to breathlessly announce to me, \"the 'Bacon and Onion Bread' is fresh from the oven.\" He understood me in a way that few other people ever have. I thought the \"Green Olive Bread\" was going to be the best thing he laid before me, but \"Bread Guy\" kept nudging me towards the baguette, even as I repeatedly passed it up. I finally succumbed and was rewarded for it with a crunchy, crackly crust, an interior both airy and lightly chewy, a perfect bit of salt, a pleasant amount of sweetness. Immediately upon my finishing it, he was at my side again to drop more bread on me. \"Bread Guy\" was awesome, even if he was diabolically trying to stuff me with bread until I exploded.  Dessert was Picasso's \"Warm Chocolate Fondant,\" a dish that has been on the menu every day since the restaurant opened, and rightly so. Yes, it's a chocolate lava cake, but the best you will ever have, and with a sphere of rocky road ice cream featuring massive melted marshmallows. In other words, the type of dessert that was made with me in mind. Shame I couldn't eat most of it due to being chock-full of bread.  Despite serving me an excellent meal, I can't put Picasso in the same stratosphere as Restaurant Guy Savoy, MGM Grand's Joel Robuchon, and Twist by Pierre Gangiere (Vegas's trinity of \"A-tier\" restaurants). Perhaps Picasso himself said it best: \"Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up...\" While Picasso is unquestionably one of the top restaurants in Las Vegas, I get the feeling that it was once so much more when it was awarded its two Michelin stars. Aside from the Pheasant Croquette, there is no dish concept I had at Picasso that I have not previously had somewhere else on the Strip and, honestly, although I put Picasso ahead of nearby heavy-hitting neighbors Le Cirque, Lago, Jasmine, and Spago, it is not even the best restaurant in the Bellagio - that honor belongs to Michael Mina's eponymous restaurant.  Still, despite there being slightly better options in the ultra-competitive dining landscape it inhabits, there's really no cause for complaint at Picasso. If this was just a restaurant that served food, I would come here. If it was a Picasso exhibit, I would come here. That one can scratch both itches in one place makes Picasso a very special place to dine.

Dress code is business casual- saw many people with jeans and sneakers so you don't have to dress up but you should!  Since it was cold tonight decided to sit indoors.   Decided to do the prix fixe menu priced at $122 each.  The poached oysters with the caviar and vermouth sauce was fantastic.  Never had poached oysters before.  For second course the big eye tuna tartare was pretty solid.  It was a big portion.  For main dish got the butter poached Maine lobster ($30 upcharge).  I loved this dish!  They cut and gave you all the pieces- lobster tail, claws and knuckles all under some damn good sauces and puree.  All the meat was so tender and almost melted in your mouth.  The service was great even though their food runner kept messing up who had what dish. He said it was his first day.  This is a great fine dining restaurant with prices that won't break the bank compared to other fine dining restaurants in the strip.  If you sit outside, the views of the fountains are amazing but I heard other diners complaining about getting wet.",

Definitely request outside seating ahead of time when you make reservations so that not only you get great food, but you also get a great show from the Fountains of Bellagio.   The food is all prix fixe. However under each section, you have options between 3 or 4 dishes. And if you have dietary restrictions, they are happy to accommodate.   This is one place where you will get your moneys worth. Quality food. Amazing surrounding. Attentive service. If you haven't been, definitely add this to your list of must eat places!",

We got it paired with delicious House Wine.   My boyfriend got his Truffle Mushroom dish - they only had four plates for the entire night - priced at $330. Filet Minon Rare Steak with sprinkled Truffle mushroom, some pasta and mashed souffle with Truffled mushrooms!   We also got some delicious Pink stuff - unfortunately I don't know what it's called but it was delicious - put it under your tongue and wait til the taste gives you fireworks.   Excellent customer service.   Beautiful decor and supposedly all the paintings are drawn from Picasso which is amazing!   Desserts were not on par for me - my bf enjoyed all the dishes but my favorite was actually the pineapple one and the rest were way too sweet for me.   They also gave us some Cute golden box named Picasso with two pieces of brownies.",

There is a small patio behind the Bellagio water fountain show. There are only 6 tables out there. We had dinner at 7pm and we had a great new show every 15 minutes. It still helps that the water fountains at Bellagio still remain to this day my favorite thing to see in Vegas.  (Didn't get much time to peruse all the Picasso paintings as spent our time outside.)  The food is a bit overpriced... but what do you expect from a 2 Michelin Star  rated restaurant.  My wife had the 5 course vegetarian prix fixe and I had the 4 course regular prix fixe menu. We spent about $115-130 per person without wine. I thought the food overall was very good. Lot of distinct, contrasting, and complementing flavors in each dish. I won't go into detail on each dish but the progression was nice and the tempo was perfect. We were there for 2 hours. They also gave us a very nice little souvenir box with cookies in it on the way out. (In addition to the dessert we already had with out meal.) I would give the desserts 5 stars!!!  Overall a very satisfying experience. Just don't know if I'd ever go again with the price and so many other places to try.",

    "text": "4.75 stars, lost a bit for a service error, explained below.  So far this has been the highlight of my short culinary existence.  We had the Menu Degustation ($123) as it appeared more attractive than the prix fix menu ($113?).  We were handsomely rewarded for it.  We also each had chose the recommended wine pairing (additional $63).  Though pricey, it is an ABSOLUTE MUST.  The sommeliers did a masterful job of pairing the wine.  I have never known how much the right wine can enhance the proper meal, and though expensive, definitely worthwhile.  The first course is the Maine Lobster salad.  A simple small dish with a sweet Apple-Champagne vinaigrette.  The paired wine, a semi-dry German Riesling, matched perfectly with the sweetness of the lobster and had citrus tones to complement the apple vinaigrette.  As a first dish, I had thought that this was the best match of food and wine I had ever tasted.  After the first course, the amuse bouche came out?!  It must have been an error to bring the first course out so early, because we were waiting for our paired wine for a few minutes after the lobster was served.  This was an unusual error, and it was noticed by our sommelier as I heard him making a comment about it.  It did not ruin the meal per se, but otherwise marred a perfectly heavenly experience.  The second course is the Pan Seared Scallop.  Rather than light and refreshing, this dish felt heavier because it was served on a potato mousseline (finely mashed potato) and veal reduction.  It was complimented by a Pinot Gris, which was very oaky in nature, closer to a Chardonnay I felt.  This was my least favorite course, though still delicious, not quite as unique as the other courses.  The Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras came as the 3rd course, which THEN became the best food and wine combination I have ever had.  The foie gras was sauteed perfectly and placed on a mild peach/thyme pound cake, topped with almonds, and served with a riesling peach coulis.  This was served with a Tokaji, a hungarian dessert wine.  The heaviness and creaminess of the foie gras was balanced with crisp almonds and the sweetness of the coulis and the sweet wine.  Each bite takes you to another land, this culinary ecstacy.  I cannot overstate how good this course is.  For the entree course, I selected the Colorado Lamb medium rare. It was served with a pisto (similar to ratatouille, tomato based and heavy in green and red peppers) which I generally would not like, but appreciated it in the setting of this dish.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had good flavor.  The wine was a Spanish red.  This was not my favorite, though I have found myself hard to be impressed with red meats and red wine combinations.  At this point, I had asked if the balcony looking out onto the fountains was part of this restaurant.  I had thought about maybe having a couple drinks after the meal was over.  We did not want to sit out there because it was a hot night, but soon after our server came and escorted us outside to have dessert!  What a wonderful view and experience.  The dessert itself while good, was not fabulous.  There was also an assortment of little treats, which seemed to be a showcase of textures rather than flavors.  All in all I am torn between coming back to this fabulous restaurant or exploring new restaurants of similar quality.  This is a must-go once in your life!",

    "text": "Eaten here twice -- two best meals in my life! Attentive, fawning service. The waiter gave a toothful grins for every request. The sommelier was like a newscaster with a sense of humor. He recommended a Lovely Pinot Noir.  The oysters with caviar were divine. The scallops with wine reduction and potato moussaline were heavenly. My wife had the filet mignon with mousseline twice and nearly had convulsions. She has ordered it both times we came here. The lamb was also amazing.   We both had the chocolate fondant the first time. It was so good my wife ordered it again. I ordered the chocolate pecan bonbon this time. It was like a small dark chocolate cake with thick chocolate frosting. On the plate was Guinness ice cream, Bailey's Irish Cream foam, a tiny creme brulee \"block\" and some candied pecan -- out-of-control delicious!  Again, the best meals we've ever had. And we've been all over: Paris, Rome, New York, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, London, Tehran, Phnom Penh, Boston, San Francisco, Singapore, Hong Kong,  Marrakech.",

    "text": "What a great dining experience!    From the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out, the staff made us feel very welcome and made the night very enjoyable.  We started off with the amuse bouche, which was a medallion of foie gras on top of a crostini and a small cup of potato soup topped with some pine nuts. It was a great start to the meal.  That night there were two prix fixe menus.  The 5 course menu degustation and a 4 course menu. There was also the choice of substituing an appetizer dish with tuna tartare and/or your main course with japanese kobe filet as daily specials.  Since the Kobe was an additional 100 dollars, and me having lost more than that at the tables the night previous, I decided to stick with their other main course offerings.  The first dish was a maine lobster salad with an apple-champagne vinaigrette.  It was very refreshing and light.  Great first dish.  Second was the pan seared sea scallop on a bed of potato mousseline and veal reduction sauce.  This is the best sea scallop I ever had.  Just thinking about this dish makes me hungry.  Third was the seared foie gras. It was very rich and almost just metls in your mouth.  There were two choices for the main course: Sauteed Filet of Halibut or the Tournedos of Aged Lamb.  I went for the lamb.    The lamb was served medium rare with red peppers and a heart of artichoke with bernaise sauce.  Lamb was cooked to perfection and the flavors just exploded.    For dessert there were several choices, but I went with the chocolate fondant with peanut butter ice cream and caramel.  The service and atmosphere added to the full experience.  I could go on and on about Picasso, but I'd rather you enjoy it for yourself!",

The service and the food was excellent in taste and appearance but extremely small portions do it an injustice not only based on price but on the fact it leaves you hungry to truly taste the main entree. The atmosphere and surroundings are 5 star but again the food was not. I would have to agree with many of the comments made in \"Not Recommended\" section. Don't want to appear overlly critical but perhaps a good paella and a more expanded menu would help.  The two choice left or right menu does not work for me it seemed to restricted and not really worth the price of a supposed 5 star Zagat rated place. Makes you wonder about their ratings.",

    "text": "My wife would give it a 6 star rating. The food was well made. Not very flavorful but rich and delicate (a work of art my my fancy wife just added). Quantity is slim if you are a big guy but for the skinny jeans wearing and no chest hair type guys, the quantity will suffice. I had the $115 dinner my friends had the $125 option and were disappointed in the quantity and hated the foie gras (not their type of food) and the fact that the \"scallops\" was really \"a scallop\" and the \"lamb chops\" was \"a lamb chop\".  Good experience overall. Great service. They forgot to bring me my coffee do they ended comping which was not necessary but goes with the classiness of this place. $300 million in Picasso painting according to some places I've read. You get a good view of fountains if you get seats next to window which we couldn't because they only seat 2 and we were 4. Even with reservations don't expect to get fountain view table for 2 as a guarantee.   If you are a vegetarian or pescetarian as ourselves let them know and they will go out of their way for you. Like I said service is great. If my expectation of the food wasn't so high going in I would have rated it higher. It doesn't matter what Zagat or Michelin or Opera Winfrey say or how many stars, thumbs up or diamonds anyone gives them. Food is going into your mouth. Maybe they had a special meal cooked for them by Picasso himself.   So worth going but don't expect to taste heaven. Its good food that is different than what you will get in your typical U.S. city. It's the higher than normal expectations and us being spoiled that has ruined our planet and society as a whole so try it out and stop reading these reviews like a stingy old man.",

With that said, I feel very well with my experience at Picasso.  We made early reservations.  When we arrived, we were allowed to view the collection of works by the artist and actually took a few photos.(What? I'm a tourist.)  We were given a choice of sitting indoors or out.  We decided to sit inside, but still had a great view of the fountains.  ' best of both worlds.  It seems the menu doesn't change much.  If you have something good, why mess with it?  I will say that after the amuse bouche and next course were served, I thought I might need something to snack on later.  They were both exquisitely plated, subtle yet rich, and....small. But I was wrong.  Everything was perfect.  By the time we left the restaurant, we were both satiated on every level (No, we didn't have sex, but I think my mouth had multiple orgasms.)    Service was excellent.  Our waiter, Robert was personable yet professional.  He was knowledgeable and his recommendations were spot on.  If our tastes had been different that night, I am confident Robert would have called it right.  I feel the same about our sommelier although he spoke a little too softly, at times. (What's with all the French accents?)  Expensive, but:  beautiful setting, soothing, yet dynamic atmosphere, excellent service, fine French food........Yes!",

    "text": "So this is a hard review for me to write.  I don't really \"do\" fancy foods, since my palate isn't refined enough to really appreciate any subtleties in flavor.  I also don't like to pay for food that I'm not really going to appreciate fully, especially if said food costs hundreds of dollars.  Luckily, this was a treat by a friend's family, so I can handily ignore the hell out of that last part and focus on the food!  I had the \"Degustation Menu\" with wine pairings, but I'll preface that by saying that I have no taste for wine (I was really, really out of my element here).  As a result, I won't really talk much about the wine, except I thought that they were really appropriate with whatever I had.  Unfortunately all that wine meant that I started to fall asleep way early in the night, but I can't really blame that on the restaurant.  The food was exquisite, as one would expect.  I think the standout was the foie gras, which I normally kinda hate, but was curious whether a Michelin star restaurant could change my perspective.  It did, in that I learned that foie gras doesn't always have to taste like shoe scrapings, but it really was extraordinarily rich.  It weirdly reminded me of duck fat, actually.    The decor is fantastic, with the Bellagio fountain shows going off outside the window and the Picassos adorning the walls of the restaurant, it all speaks of this sort of fantastically extravagant lifestyle that I could only have a taste of.  I especially loved the plates and was really tempted to steal some for home.  Somehow.    The service is phenomenal.  Water was refilled regularly.  There was a delay in one of the courses of our meal, which they comped us for with extra wine for that course, as well as a free sample of an exquisite dessert wine that I would not have had otherwise.  Just really fantastic.  What a wonderful experience.",

The service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is very pleasant with real Picasso paintings surrounding you and the Bellagio fountains running constantly outside.   The food comes into fix menus only, no a la carte. The food was very good, the portions are on the small side, but it does fill you up.   My only complain is the price. Being originally from Europe (even though I am a US citizen), it is hard for me to understand how we can rack up a bill of $600 for 3 menus + a bottle of wine. We have amazing 4 courses restaurants in Europe for less than $50pp, taxes and service included...  Just makes no sense at all!   I know, I am in America, but sorry, there is no justification for it.

    "text": "Was surprised by a dinner at Picasso for my anniversary. It was tied for the best meal I've had in Vegas (hard to compare it E, which is such a different experience).   Highlights:  -Amuse bouche: a bamboo skewer with 1/2 of a hard-boiled quail egg, smoked salmon (spritzed with lemon), and caviar. Simple, but perfectly balanced and the best amuse I've had in a long time.  - Scallop: beautiful sear on a bed of pomme puree with a demi-glace reduction, with a length-wise section potato chip for texture. I also had some bacon bread with this-- which has inspired me to bake some at home!  -Foie Gras: Usually I prefer a torchon with brioche, but this was the best seared piece I have ever had. Here the technique was just amazing: an perfect sear on both sides-- the inside was like butter. The pistachio garnish added texture and brought out the nutty qualities of the Sauternes for the pairing.  -Lamb:Best lamb I've ever had. Apparently it's organic and sourced from Colorado, from a farm that tries to raise them in a Wagyu type of fashion. It was so incredibly tender that I was sure they sous-vided it, but the waiter claimed it was roasted. It was served with a rosemary infused demi-glace reduction and an elegant take on ratatouille. Ordered it rare instead of the suggested med-rare, and was glad I did. Syrah aged in American oak made for a nice pairing.  -Dessert: The standout of the plate was the Guiness ice cream.  The service was excellent as well. (There was a goofy moment when we asked if there were any additional pairings not listed on the menu and the waiter told us that \"the wine gets progressively heavier to match the food\" lol, I should hope so! And one waiter seemed particularly enamored with asking \"can I get you anything else,\" which is a bit odd when repeated and in the context of a tasting menu. What are we going to do, ask for ketchup?  )  I appreciated that we weren't rushed in the slightest, despite having one of the nice two-tops right by the window. We were at the restaurant for over 3.5 hours, in part because we started with champagne before the dinner.  I really liked how they kept the restaurant decor simple except for the dazzling Picassos, and the beautiful multi-colored informal flowers on the center stand, which played off of the bright colors in the paintings.  I thought that the dinner was also a good value. There were many expensive ingredients, and dinner came to ~600 for two (though we spent around 200 on beverages). This makes it the best value tasting menu I've ever had, and one of my all-time favorite meals.",

The wine listing is impressive with a variety of wines from all over the world, but I really appreciated the Riojas. This days American restaurants carry much more Californian wines, and it is not easy to find descent Spanish wines every were. That said, be prepared to spend a pretty penny on the wine, and the whole meal to be honest... however, it's worth it... every single penny of it!  This is a very high end, upscale restaurant, and they take the dinning experience to a whole new level taking care of every single detail, including a pretty departing gift as you leave the place. As I said before the service is very friendly and courteous, not a pretentious ambiance at all, something that I personally really appreciate!  Picasso is a delicious experience, from the moment you cross the door and enter the restaurant, you will feel immersed in an exquisite experience! Do NOT miss it!",

It's right next to the fountain at Bellagio so it was great to step outside to the patio and watch the show. Very romantic setting for couples.  Dessert was also very tasty. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Amazing food but I felt a little out of place.  We made reservations and were sat promptly. The restaurant had a very formal feel to it and the overall noise level was low. When we were sat at the table for 2 we felt too far apart and I would need to speak uncomfortably loud in order to have a conversation with my date. I requested a new table and was moved to a much nicer one for 4 were we could sit next to each other.    We ordered one of each tasting menus with both supplements for the evening, she had the lobster and I had the filet. A nice bottle of wine + tip set us back $600  Expensive but this will go down as one of the best meals I've ever had. Everything about the food was beyond perfect, we cleaned every plate brought out to us. Nom Nom :)  We were easily the youngest people there by 20 years, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to those seeking a fun atmosphere. Well decorated yes, lively no. However, if your passionate about food and are willing to spend what its worth then Picasso will not disappoint you.",

    "text": "Two words: OVERRATED and OVERPRICED  Julian Serrano you disappoint me.  I had high expectations of Picasso (in the Bellagio), especially since I read such amazing Yelp reviews.  However, my experience was anything but.   Since they were booked for the week of new years, we were only able to score a reservation for NYE. I was a bit disappointed because that meant that we would have to spend an additional $35 per person for the same menu they serve on regular days.   Service:  Upon arriving, the hostess told us our table was ready and sat us at the table farthest away from the water show.  Even upon asking to be moved, we were not moved and the place was close to EMPTY!! At first I thought it was because they were solidly booked up for the evening, but throughout our meal, we saw that most of the tables were open. For a restaurant with an amazing view, I saw none of the water show. This was extremely disappointing!    When our server came to introduce himself, we asked a few questions about the dishes and he didn't really know much about them. When asked for suggestions, he just said all of the dishes taste good.  For a 2 Michelin star restaurant, I expected the service to be amazing and the server to be knowledgeable about the dishes and be able to give us some suggestions.  This was not the case.    From my past experience at Michelin star restaurants, when our dishes came, the server would explain a little bit about the dish and what we were eating.  This didn't happen at Picasso, instead they just put the food on the table.  In addition, Michelin star restaurants are known for their service. We had crumbs on the table from the bread and food and they never came over to clean it up.  Moreover we ordered lemonade for a drink and they never came over to ask if we wanted a refill, bring out another one, or even take the glass away, just left the glass empty at our table.   What drastically hindered our fine dining experience was the photographer that Picasso hired for the night (or maybe its every evening).  The lady came by each table to take photos and asked for our name, hotel, and room number.  She told us that she would deliver the photos to our rooms after our meal.  I was annoyed that she interrupted our first course, but since they were going to deliver the photos to our room, I thought why not.  Only this was not the case. The photos were NOT free. She came back after we received our main course and told us that the photos cost $140 for the package (2 portfolios of 8x10s (four 8x10s) and 2 portfolios of wallet sizes (four wallets)) or we could purchase each 8x10 portfolio for $40 and each wallet portfolio for $25... adding it up it would have been cheaper to purchase each portfolio separately rather than get the \"package\". Our photos were very unprofessional and were crumpled so we did not purchase them.  I handed it back to our server and asked him to tell her we did not want it.  She then came back (interrupting our dinner for the third time) and asked us if we were to purchase the photos.  I had explained to her that we had given it to our server and would not like to purchase them.  She asked why and kept badgering us to purchase them.  Never before had we had such an awful experience at any type of Michelin star restaurant being interrupted so many times during dinner and then badgered and guilt tripped into purchasing photos we did not want.   Food: Although I had read reviews about how amazing the food was at Picasso, ours was only mediocre.    What I ordered: pan seared u-10 day boat scallop, sauteed steak of \"a\" foie gras, prime filet mignon, and hazelnut joconde  What my friend ordered: Alaskan crab salad, kobe spheres (some kobe meatballs in a lentil sauce thing), roasted milk-fed veal chop, and tropical napoleon  My main course was the Prime Filet Mignon and I asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it was cooked to medium.  The filet mignon lacked flavor and was very dry. I had to ask a few times before they brought out any sauce.   I ended up eating only a few bites and couldn't finish it because I was not enjoying it at all.    After being bothered by the photographer, we didn't want to eat our dessert and only finished part of it because we were so annoyed. We didn't even get time to enjoy the Picasso art!   We came here to celebrate graduating from graduate school, but left highly annoyed and upset.    Our dinner cost over $400 and we left extremely disappointed.  I would not recommend Picasso to anyone, unless you want to spend big bucks for mediocre food and service.  For such an expensive meal, I  much rather would have spent it on several meals elsewhere.  We've been to Julian Serrano in the Aria hotel and greatly enjoyed our experience there more. It is 1/5 of the cost and the servers are much more knowledgeable and friendly, plus we were never hustled for photos or bothered throughout our dinner there.",

Upon entering, you see the amazing Picasso's hung on the walls. If you sit by the window you'll have a fantastic view of the Bellagio water show. The patio seating has an even better view of that, but you miss out on seeing the artwork. The restaurant as a whole embodies a piece of art by Picasso. From the backs of the chairs to the designs on the pillars, everything accents the art beautifully. The art itself makes this restaurant worth eating at. However, the food is impeccable and worth every dollar.   I ordered from the Prix fixe menu  Butternut Squash Soup- Tasty and I loved the marshmallows Kobe Spheres- Fancy meatballs. They were delicious. Tai Snapper- I enjoyed my friends Black Bass more, but the Snapper was still great. Warm Chocolate Fondant- Like a chocolate lava cake. The huckleberries were fresh and made the chocolate taste even better.  They served a dessert tower at the end which was cute.",

We had a 630 reservation and when we were seated the waiter asked if we were heading to a show later in the evening and assured us we would be out on time.  we were a table of 4 and we all ordered the 128 fixed price menu including 5 courses.  All the courses were delicious and plated very nicely. But the 2 that stood out to me were the scallop and Foie Gras. The scallop was large and perfectly cooked with the perfect texture. The Foie Gras...oh man the Foie Gras was the most divine and decadent thing i've ever tasted. The portion was extremely generous, it could have been served as a main course...and it just melted in your mouth. OMG i would go back solely for the foie gras. I wanted to savour every bite.  The service was attentive but not intrusive, and everything was on point for that night. it made our dining experience very enjoyable, plus you're surrounded by original picasso artwork and you get a great view of the bellagio fountains. It would have been nice to get a seat out on the patio, but unfortunately we were not VIP enough.  To end our experience at Picasso, we were given a box of muffins for the next day....the box was really nice!  Picasso, I'll be back...for the Foie Gras.",

Nothing like getting Lobster salad, Scallop, foie gras, halibut and dessert in one continual  setting! The preparation and execution was superb! Everything cooked perfectly and visually appealing. I just didn't get the 3 tables layout in our corner, \"family style\". I was facing the couple in front of me, and the table on the other end was also facing the same couple. So basically, I was trying not to make eye contact with two couples during our $500 intimate dinner. So much for being comfortable. If I come back, there will be a request for a better table. So live and learn! By the way, this restaurant is not easy to find inside the huge busy Bellagio. It's is located by the shops, across from the Chanel, down the escalator, next to the Prime Steakhouse. Yes it is absolutely worthed visiting this fine establishment. Just make sure to request a decent table! May I request grabbing a cocktail from the friendly bartender first? Because this is the first thing you should do, before you head to your table. Just get there 15 minutes before your reservation....",

From start to finish, our experience was superb. we had the degustation menu and a cpuple of glasses of wine and got out for under $400, which I believe is a relative bargain for food of this caliber.

    "text": "I went here for my 30th birthday and it was well worth it.  I got reservations for a Friday night at 6pm. When we went in they had a table for us, but my girlfriend wanted to sit outside. They were very accommodating and brought us out to a large table on the patio overlooking the water. When we first sat down, there were some pine needles and a bit of debris on the table. They cleaned it off and I did not think much of it, until later when we discovered why they were on the table. We were sitting under a pine tree, and when the wind blew it was dropping bits and pieces on the table! The waiter feigned ignorance as if he had never seen that happen before, but it detracted from an otherwise stellar meal.  So we took our time in deciding which of the three available courses we wanted. There was a prix fixe menu that my girlfriend ended up choosing and the degustation menu I decided on. I mentioned that I was pescatarian and the waiter said it was no problem making substitutions as need be, so I ended up substituting the foie gras dish for a shrimp dish from the prix fixe menu. I also decided to do the wine pairing for the degustation menu.  I have to say that all the food I had was exquisite. Each course had a wide variety of flavors, that blended together so well that I felt my palate was going on a ride. The various courses covered different sensations on my tongue as well, from creamy, to crispy, and nearly everything in between. It was all so rich and flavorful. All but one of the wine pairings seemed spot on.  My girlfriend enjoyed her meal as well, except for her main course of the roasted pigeon. She took one taste and decided it just was not for her. Fortunately when she took it home for the doggies, they LOVED it!  The experience was really 4.5 stars and I'm sure it could have been 5 stars with a few tweaks. The $400 I spent for the evening was more than worth it.",

You can go outdoors and watch the water show. Plus, you can feed the ducks the bread. My cousin can communicate with the ducks. She figured out that if you clap your hands, the ducks will come to you.  I would recommend ordering from the right side of the menu. First, they give you a Pheasant Croquette and a drinkable cold Potato Vichyssoise.   I got the white asparagus, and the quail salad. They're both very grand. For an entree, I got the veal. And for dessert, i got the Trio of Meyer Lemon, Vanilla, and Rasberry.This place is actually expensive, so I split my din din with my bro. One meal is $115! But if you get the special, that's another $40.  Now, if you're a fan of soups, my mommy got a pea soup. It was delicious. Also, here's a joke from ICarly. What's the difference between Roast Beef and Pea Soup? Anyone can \"roast Beef\", but nobody can \"pee Soup\"! Ha ha.  The waiters put the napkins on your laps once you sit down, and the bathroom is so fancy!  But now, the bad part is that Picasso has a dress code. They say Business Casual, when my mom called. She spoke with a man, who said that children could go in with shorts and a collared shirt. But when we went there, three waitresses said we had to have long black pants or jeans. We had to wait 10 minutes, while one of the waitresses got me and my bro black pants. She said we could put them over our normal pants, and also said that they might be too big, but when I put them on, they actually fit pretty well. I tucked my shirt in, which is optional, and I looked like a clown!!!! That was pretty ridiculous, and also they forgot my dessert, so we had to wait an extra 10 minutes at the end of dinner. So, yeah, it was pretty ridiculous at some times, and I was pretty ticked off. But otherwise, it was good.",

    "text": "Rundown - Had the Pre-Theater menu  - Interesting decor.  It looked a bit dated but still lovely - View of the Bellagio Fountians are wonderful at night - get a seat near the windows for optimum view - Only bad thing? They can't make a cosmo....It was the worst cosmo I've ever had.  After my first quarter of gradschool, my boyfriend and I took a trip to Vegas to celebrate after finals. While we were here, my boyfriend wanted to try Picasso, since this was on his list of must try Vegas resturants.  We ended up with the prefixed menu because we were on a time crunch due to our tickets to see the Lion King that evening.    The resturant is very accomodating and very polite.  Our original reservations were for two but we changed it at the last minute because we wanted another friend to come along.  The staff and hosts were very polite - exactly what I expect from a resturant like Picasso.    While, I loved the service, I wasn't impressed by the drinks.  I honestly feel that it went downhill from the drink.  I had ordered a Cosmo - my standard drink to order - and it was the absolute worst cosmo I've ever had.  The ratio was off and it tasted too sour.  While I thought it was all in my head, my boyfriend and friend both agreed that the drink was way off and didn't even taste good.    Moving along....  Amuse Bouche consisteted of warm soup (made with a red bell pepper, if I remember correctly) and a small croquette on the side.  The croquette wasn't overly flavorfull and was really good.    First dish was Poach Oysters with bits of caviar.  The light sauce made the oysters delish.  It was great with a bit of lemon too.    My main dish was the Sauteed Fliet of Halibut and the boyfriend had the Veal Chops.  I love Halibut but I made the biggest mistake of ordering the Halibut.  Dry and not flavorful and wouldn't recommend anyone ordering the diesh.  The Veal Chops on the other hand were really good.  Tender and moist and wasn't overcooked.  They came with potatoes sauteed mushrooms that went well with the chops.    There were a few options for dessert and the three of us tried three different types.  We had ordered the chocolate fondant which came with a side of vanilla gelato.  Great taste and ate every bite of it.  To accompany our desserts, they also served little Jellies which topped off the dessert.    While the Halibut and Cosmo were horrible - I'd still like to come by and try the tasting menu one day.",

First walked in and they told me I couldn't be seated without a collared shirt even though I was wearing jeans dolce shows and a nice t-shirt. So after talking to the snobby host he sits us. Like really you still work at a restaurant your not better then anyone. Another beef I had is the menu was prefix which I liked. But the up charge for wagyu was insanely expensive. There should be a beef dish on the pre fix so your not obligated to pay 200 dollar supplement for the wagyu. But the place was nice and the food was good. If your looks for a snobby atmosphere and expensive food it's not a bad choice. But should still should just go to Guy Savoy or Joel Robouchon.",

    "text": "How can you not enjoy a restaurant that has Picasso ceramics and about $100 million worth of original Picasso paintings looming over you as you eat?    Within minutes of arriving at the restaurant, we were seated near the window with a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains.  The decor seemed to be designed to be intimate and comfortable.  A variety of fresh flowers decorated the tables and the dining room centerpiece of vases.  (Below you will find a description of the most non-politically correct meal in the history of the world--but it was oh so delicious)  My meal started with the poached oysters that were each garnished with a small teaspoon of Osetra caviar.  Next came the foie gras au torchon.  This is not my most favorite method of foie gras preparation--I prefer it sauteed on both sides, leaving a brown outer crust and smooth inner layer.  Luckily, that was my boyfriend's next course (grade-A sauteed foie gras), so I couldn't help but take a few bites from his plate.  For my main entree I had the veal chop that was well marbled with fat and overflowing in flavor.    The service was not pretentious and was overall attentive.  I would suggest ditching the ripped jeans and sneakers before coming to dinner at this establishment.",

They recognized us as return guests. We were given the choice of dining on the patio or inside. We chose inside since we have dined on the patio before. The inside is lovely and we could still see the fountains from an intimate window seat. They have an extensive wine list if you prefer, but we chose cocktails. The Manhattan and Bramble are both great. We didn't expect the cocktails to be so good since they are known for wine. These were some of my favorite cocktails ever! As stated above, the unique dishes are worth every penny spent and I can't say enough about the service. Fine dining places can have a reputation for being stuffy. Picasso is not at all stuffy. We loved that our server Blake had a sense of humor that came along with his impeccable level of service. We have eaten at quite a few fine dining establishments in Vegas and Picasso continues to be our favorite.",

    "text": "LAST MEAL ON EARTH. If I had to select my last meal on Earth, I would probably opt to relive my dinner at Picasso. The food, the service, the view, the wine, the ambience--the entire experience was perfectly magical.   My husband and I both had the pre fixe menu with wine pairings. We selected different items for each course and we both tasted everything. I expected the food to be excellent, but this was more than just food. It was art. Of course, it was visually appealing--every plate designed with colors and shapes for maximum ocular impact. With every bite, I had the sense that someone's plan to surprise and delight was unfolding before me. And the wine pairings? Most superb I've ever experienced. Even with dishes I wouldn't normally have loved--the foie gras, for example--it was a bit sweet for me, but the luscious Hungarian Aszu revealed a depth of delicate aroma I couldn't get enough of.   And throughout the meal we were continually surprised. First, with a yummy amuse bouche, and at the very end with a dainty little box of pastries. The next morning I savored the pastries over coffee and remembered the beautiful evening. After the dessert course, they presented us with the prettiest little tray of chocolates. I've never felt so spoiled.   And where would you like to enjoy this splendid meal? Let's see, how about in a room filled with the bright, rich colors of a Picasso painting? Over the top flower arrangements and the Master's artwork on the walls. Oh yes, and the view? The famous dancing waters of Bellagio's fountains outside the window.   Memories are better than things. Things can disappear in an instant through theft or disaster or carelessness, but memories are forever. I'll always treasure our dinner at Picasso--a delicious, perfect evening. xoxo",

    "text": "WOW! Absolutely Fantastic!  The room is GORGEOUS, with authentic Picassos hanging on the walls. The calming cream colors with blue and wood accents are beautifully balanced, allowing the dining room design to be art in it's own right, but at the same time not taking away from the masterpieces hanging on the wall and most importantly, the food!  We started our degustation menu with the maine lobster salad. It was beautiful in it's simplicity. I have no idea what the chefs did to this lobster, but when I put it in my mouth, I really felt like I was tasting lobster for the first time. The flavor was so...clean. I wish I had a better \"foodie vocabulary\" to describe it, but it was simply clean, fresh and delightful; unlike any other lobster I've ever tasted.   The Riesling was a nice pairing, the only reason why I'm not calling it great is because my perception of great wine pairings was quickly changed by our third course...more on that later.  Our second course was pan seared scallops with a potato mousseline and veal jus. I honestly wasn't expecting to be a huge fan of this course because the potato mousseline and veal jus sounded way too heavy for the sweet, light flesh of great scallops. After I took my first few bites, I was a convert. When I mentioned my apprehension and then enjoyment of this course to our server, he informed me that it was one of the chef's signatures dishes. Just try it and I think you'll understand why.  Next was the sauteed foie grass with a peach thyme pound cake, almonds and a riesling peach coulis. This dish itself was really good, but the pairing with the Royal Tokaji just blew my mind. I've always enjoyed great wine with great food, and have always understood that great food and wine can enhance each-other, but this was just another level. I can't explain it, it was almost a spiritual experience. The pairing made the foie course so much more amazing, and the foie made the Royal Tokaji almost etherial.  For our entrees I ordered the lamb, while my dining companion order the fillet mignon. Both were really good, although it was hard to appreciate the entrees since we were still \"high\" from our foie-tokaji course.   We both finished with the chocolate pecan \"bon-bon;\" mainly because I threatened my date that I wouldn't share my dessert. I'm usually a gentlemen, but this sounded so good I knew that if my date stole one bite of this dessert from me it would probably be the beginning of the end for us.  I'm glad I forced her to order her own because I think she enjoyed the dessert more then I did and it could have very well caused an ugly scence if we each didn't have our own.  If you've read this far then YES! YOU SHOULD EAT HERE! ;-)",

    "text": "You absolutely must not miss this if you're in Vegas and you love food/wine.  This place is famous and amazing for the quality of its food and atmosphere--NOT for a 'celebrity' chef's reputation.  Even if you don't get to sit on the terrace watching the Bellagio fountain show ringside all night, you still get to bask in the presence of seriously gorgeous art (it's not like they have a handful of piddling Picasso sketches--there are over a dozen full-blown paintings, and they are lovely).  Of course, you can still see the fountain show going off via the floor-to-ceiling windows even if you're seated inside.  Even though this is a truly special dining experience, the pricing is on par with or significantly less than many comparable places in Vegas (or in DC, for that matter).  For example, the short tasting menu at Guy Savoy in Caesar's is over $250.  At Picasso, the largest tasting menu is $125.  And you absolutely cannot go wrong with the food.  The sommelier is an amazing guy.  Rarely have I seen someone enjoy the enjoyment of others so much.  There's such a huge selection of wines by the glass that both times I've been there I've just had the sommelier take care of pairings for me.  I have had more than one truly subliminal tasting moment at Picasso because of the skill, care, and teamwork of the staff.  Truly, we'd probably be happy with PBR and sawdust in such and atmosphere/location, but Picasso is way, way above and beyond.  I will never go to Vegas without stopping here.",

    "text": "I was fortunate enough to come here for a friend's wedding reception.  We were seated on the outdoor patio as the sun was setting, so it was warm, but no longer scorching.  From the patio, you get a gorgeous view of the famous Bellagio waterfall shows, and sometimes you get sprayed with the mist, but the hotel was considerate enough to delay the water shows when it got windy - solely to keep the patio dry for us.  We had the entire patio, which was perfect for 30-40 people.  It was very private and beautiful, and it seemed so much quieter than the rest of the Vegas madness.  With the champagne service, my glass was never empty.  Passed appetizers included a pheasant croquette that was crisped just right, smooth inside, without any gaminess.  The tuna tartare with mango was buttery and fresh, served on a spoon.  There were also mini chicken skewers and beautiful poached oysters.  The first course was an ever so lightly dressed lobster salad, topped with microgreens and with small avocado balls.  I usually try to avoid dressings, but the apple vinaigrette highlighted the lobster well.  It was paired with a dry Riesling that was just right for seafood.  Next was an Alsatian Pinot Gris matched with a perfectly seared U10 sea scallop, served over super light potato mousseline, with a rich veal reduction underneath.    The 3rd course was a foie gras over a decadent piece of pound cake, with a sweet peach sauce to cut the grease of the foie gras.  I probably wouldn't have chosen a sauterne to match it, though, as it was too syrupy early in the meal.  An alternative was tender lettuces with tomatoes and a textured avocado base on the plate - it was nice to have a lighter option, especially if you don't eat foie gras.  I really appreciate how accommodating they were to my dietary preferences.  For the mains, I tried the Australian wagyu filet and the roasted lobster tail.  The wagyu was perfectly medium rare, topped with hearty mushrooms.  The lobster was so sweet and plump and perfect, I could have eaten at least 2 of that dish... and I didn't even notice the salsify until the end.  To end, we had delicate petit fours in addition to the wedding cake, and we each had a little black box of pastries as a favor to go.  Chef Julian Serrano even came out to chat with us, and I saw him visiting with other tables, too, which is so nice, since so often, big name chefs either aren't at the actual restaurant or they don't care to come out.  The sommelier is a James Beard finalist, and he was the most charming and unpretentious, approachable sommelier I've ever encountered.  Of course, service was otherwise impeccable, with napkin folding, utensil placement, opening doors and stepping back for you as you walk by...  Michelin stars, AAA diamonds, Wine Spectator awards - all well deserved.  Needless to say, the best wedding food I've ever had... and one of the best stand alone meals I've had.",

It was a \"significant\" birthday for one of us and a great evening.  Others have critiqued the food.  I'll say it was all just wonderful, but the ambiance and service made the evening.  We snagged an outside table post-dinner to have another round of post-dinner drinks.  Had been there last just over ten years ago and previously dined a la Serrano at Masa's in SF.  One thing - dress code.  As laid back as I like to think I am some places should both request and enforce it.",

Let's face it, a lot of places open here cause the chefs want to make money. They dont stay here making sure their food is coming out like they do at their original locations. so lots of imported restaurants in las vegas are not as good.   but thank goodness for Julian Serrano and his decision to stay in vegas to cook at Picasso.   I dont need to describe any dish because I honestly have always been blown away by everything he puts out. so be adventurous try something you literally can't go wrong. they also have a great wine selection and the nicest sommelier   When I recommend restaurants Picasso is #1, because its a guarantee success.",

From the first time I came here in 2004 to my last visit a year ago, I'm happy to say that this restaurant has never ceased to fail me in how consistent their excellent quality of food is.  As I mentioned earlier, the sea scallops and foie gras here are excellent. Heck, there hasn't been anything here that I've tried that I didn't love. Their chocolate desserts and even their petit fours are scrumptious. Other dishes I've tried and loved are their oysters on the half shell (topped w/caviar), their lamb, and their crab salad. Even the amuse bouches can blow you away.  Service always has been good as well, but it's the food here that is most memorable.",

The servers weren't quite as attentive as those at Le Cirque (where we dined the previous night), but it was still damn good, and the food was every bit as good. The peanut butter smore, and chocolate fondant dessert maybe even have been better than the chocolate ball at Le Cirque.   My only complaint was there wasn't a wine pairing for the dessert (and I was expecting one), but at least they had a very good 20 year Tawny Port for me to indulge in.",

The service was excellent and left very little to be desired, though they were slow to notice when I'd dropped my fork, or when I was finished with a dish. Nothing major.  The food however I felt left a bit to be desired. My husband and I make a point of going to at least two fine dining experiences a year and I felt a bit underwhelmed by the Prix Fixe that is currently available. He ordered the Menu Degustation and had a far better experience. The poached oysters were phenomenal but that is truly the only dish that stood out. The foie gras au torchon was served with blood oranges which succeeded in bringing out the worst flavors in the foie... leaving it gamey. I had the fallow deer as my main, which was again excellent but the pairings on the plate left a great deal to be desired. They had it with caramelized apples and a horrid red cabbage kraut. The apples I found out later were a nod to the fact that the deer had been fed apples on the farm, but I found them too sweet for how mellow the venison was... and the kraut??? WHY? The venison was so delicate and here it was paired with this loud brash side that would have paired better with a sausage or game meat with a robust flavor. It was over powering and I found myself only eating the meat and apples as a dessert. The staff couldn't pick up on the fact that I wasn't enjoying these dishes and didn't realize I was quite done with them until I pointedly asked them to be taken away.   But like I said my husband's meal was quite a different story. He enjoyed every dish, and what I tried from his plates seemed far better balanced than what I was served. Perhaps I just chose poorly, but for a 10.00 difference in pricing it seems silly that I should have such a markedly different experience. It pains me to see such wonderful ingredients that are marred by their pairings. Better luck next time I suppose.",

The food and the service were spectacular and the ambiance was quite elegant. Our view of the Bellagio fountain was breath-taking and the art collection in the restaurant were quite exquisite and added a great touch!  For the two of us, we spent a little under $400 (including tax and tip) for dinner (we got a few drinks) and thought that it was well worth the money! The quality of the food and the presentation of the dishes were extravagant and really was the highlight of our trip! My favorite had to be the scallops and the foie gras. I ordered from the $128 menu and my husband ordered from the $118 menu. Both were great but I think my menu had an extra dish and the scallops were just so divine that if I came back, I would order from the same menu.  You really have to experience Picasso to fully grasp how amazing the experience is! I highly recommend you make reservations the next time you come to Vegas and you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for stellar food and an great experience, but it overall felt flat where the smallest changes would have made the difference.   The venue is nice as you have art to look at and/or the Bellagio fountains as a view. The seats were a bit close though. I can hear other peoples conversation and it was a open room so a large boisterous group overtook the room.    I went for a different menu than my husband so that we may try bites of each others dishes. Nothing was bad, but few really stood out on terms of execution. The best for me was the roasted squab as the preparation was spot on and allowed the meat to be showcased. The foie torchon was also buttery and lovely.   My main issue was pace. We had 4 courses and we had about 30 minutes between each course. My hubby and I can talk for hours, but even we got a bit restless to the idle between things and I was SO over sitting here after 3 hours. This is the first time I've done a course meal of only 4 dishes that took as long as dozen at their other French cuisine peers.   The other was the old school service from our main waiter. \"What will the lady be having?\" is a question to ask the lady dining. They chatted up the husband a bit, but never once included me into the conversation. All the questions were directed at the husband only. Our server knew we were local, knew what my husband did for a living, and places we've dined at. I hand the check with my card, the bill was handed to my husband. I do not understand this type of formal sexism. I didn't feel like this was a place that lived up to a standard of wonderful service because the service was only for one of us.   There were little things I did like. As you leave they give you a small box of cookies and the hosting staff was very welcoming coming in as well as out. The bussers were all very friendly and attentive.   I don't think I would be returning. I will keep trying other French places to find a favorite. Shame.",

Unfortunately, you won't be able to catch a glimpse of Danny, Tess, or Terry Benedict, but the restaurant's ambiance, professionalism, and courses will definitely make you want to stay for a while.  I chose to treat my parents (party of 3) to a fancy schmancy restaurant and ended up picking this gem. (Tip: if you want to be near the fountains, either go as a pair or like five people in your party. Three had us sitting near a pillar. Still great views of the different portraits.) We called in 2 weeks beforehand just to ensure we had a table (you can never be too sure) We dressed up for the occasion, but apparently if you're from Macau you really DGAF and can where whatever you'd like!  (Tip: if you come in early, the staff don't mind you taking closer looks of paintings near the empty tables) Onto the food: beautiful, elegant, rich, more amazing synonyms... You're given three menus to choose from. My party all settled on the menu degustacion which you can find in the plethora of menu pics. We also decided to go a bit and beyond and get the accompanied wine pairings!  -Amuse Bouche: confused us all as it wasn't on the menu. The crisp was a great palate starter and the soup was a great accompaniment. -Maine Lobster Salad: light, succulent, and different. Mom and Dad were amazed. -10 Day Scallop: So rich. I could have finished here and would have been satisfied. But there was more!! -Seared Foie Gras: first time having it in all my life. What a time to be alive. Wow. I can't compare it to anything except a really rich bone marrow. Mom wasn't a fan so I got to have more. Her loss. My immediate gain. So good... No words -Colorado Lamb: Really tender. I was a fan. Perfect main course. Super impressed how amazing the meat was.  -Desert: lovely topper to a beautiful night. Had coffee too! (Tip: show runs every 15 minutes so don't feel rushed to nab a balcony spot. Haha.)  Our dinner ran from 5:45 to around 8:30 not rushed at all. Best dinner ever... and hell yeah I saw Ocean's Eleven after the dinner.  TLDR: Best dinner of my life. Nbd. Also, foie gras is life changing.",

Enter elegantly into a dimly but still well-lit restaurant, Cue service - servers pull out your chairs, constantly, but politely and subtly ask you if you want anything else, replace your napkins with a freshly folded one when you leave for the bathroom, a sommelier for your wines, etc. It was utterly beautiful. We sat right next to the window and were able to watch the beautiful light show throughout our dinner. The art collection truly made the restaurant, with beautiful Picasso painting scattered throughout. The bathrooms were superb - clean, well-lit, lots of towels all carefully rolled up, wonderfully smelling soap and lotion. Just going there is an experience; the food makes it utterly unforgettable.   Our meals comprised of both pre-set menus - there was the prix fixe menu (which I got) and she got the menu degustation. The MD has 1 more plate than the prix fixe; my wife got the scallop, foie gras, filet mignon, and dessert. My meal was warm quail salad, foie gras au torchon, roasted veal chop, and dessert. As we aren't selfish with each other re: delicious food, we got to try each other's dishes and it was utterly heavenly. The scallop was crispy and tender, with that nice umami sear contrasting with the light  texture of the scallop. She didn't like my foie gras as much as it was served cold and almost as a butter consistency; I thought it was wonderful. Her filet was juicy and meaty and glorious while my veal was unbelievably tender. The dessert were nice little homemade truffle looking things; as compliments of the chef, he wrote \"Congratulations\" because we had called head to reserve a table and said it was our honeymoon. Awesome job chef! He also gave us a nice soup beforehand and the bread (mine was olive studded and hers was French) was excellent, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. My dessert was the peach and hers was the shortcake.  We got 2 sets of libations on the recommendation of the sommelier - I have no recollection what they were, but mine was a dessert wine and it was one of the cheapest. Nevertheless, it was excellent, full-bodied with lots of delicious chocolate and roasted notes and a sweet finish. I would recommend it many times over. My wife got a nice white wine and I have no idea b/c I was too busy watching the fountain show that had just started.   I'm not one to fuss over presentation - I would rather have delicious food that looked terrible than terrible food that was a feast for the eyes. But the meals here were elegant, classy, and very well made. Sophistication seems to come to mind as an apt description and it was wonderful treat not just for the belly but for the eyes as well.   All in all, this was one of the best meals that I have ever eaten. Well worth the price and well deserved of the Michelin starts. Fantastic job by the chefs and when I save up again, I'll be back. But that might be a while because you pay for what you eat.   TL;DR Awesome awesome awesome awesome food. And service. And art. And everything else.",

    "text": "500th review for a special dinner :)  Picasso has been on my list for years now! I went to visit my boyfie a couple weeks ago with no expectations, but he had this dinner planned for weeks. GF appreciation dinners are simply the best :)   The both of us opted for the 4 course prix fixed menu so we could order different things and try 8 different things. For the first course we had soup and the poached oysters. The soup was good, but lukewarm. The poached oysters were out of this world! 10/10 would order the poached oysters over and over again.  The second course we ordered the foie gras and salmon. The foie gras was served in pate form with dessert type pie/tart. I really did not understand this dish and just could not swallow it. I had the boyfie eat this dish because it was just not my cup of tea. He did not even end up eating the tart/pie crust part either. The salmon was amazing and perfectly cooked. The only downside was that it looked like farm raised salmon.  The third course was lobster and halibut. Both were great! I'd highly recommend going with all the fish dishes here because those were the best cooked/tasting. By the dessert course I thought I was going to explode so we ended up sharing the peach dessert. Yummy.   We also went with the wine pairing which was just OK. All the wines by itself were great, but I just didn't feel like each one complimented the dishes perfectly. I wish we had just ordered a bottle and saved the extra $$$.   The service was good, but not amazing. Not sure how this place used to carry 2 michelin stars, but it felt more like a 1 star restaurant. The view of the fountain show made up for most things though :) This is a very romantic, intimate setting. The food wasn't A+, but it was such a special dinner. Worth a try.",

    "text": "Perhaps I waited too long to come here because the food seemed too classical and not daring. Granted, chef Julian Serrano's award-winning restaurant is nearly 20-years-old and I did try to visit in 2001, but was told the restaurant was closed for a private event. Not that the food was bad or dated, but it took time for me to adjust to the traditional French refinement instead of bold creativity. When sitting down to eat at Picasso, think \"attention to detail\" to get into the right mindset and ask after every bite, \"Can I taste the essence of each ingredient?\"  The cooking is not about big flavors, but subtle clarity and detailed execution. I imagine that the kitchen is filled with immersion circulators to cook the food to the exact degree. Vegetables like innocent little carrots that were precisely between crunchy and soft or beets just tender enough to cut through, but not more.  The flavor profiles were not about unique or clever ingredient mash-ups, but traditional combinations like foie gras with apple or veal with potato. Even when straying from French into German cuisine, the deer loin was served with a tangy red cabbage slaw.  This is not fatty French cooking where butter and cream are the main ingredients. Fats coat the palate which block the ability to taste the spirit of each ingredient. The asparagus and morels came with a cream sauce, but it was very thin instead of heavy which allowed the vegetables and mushrooms to shine. The spring pea soup was more like a pea broth than a thick veloute - again to let the pea flavor become the center of attention. Even the dressing on the warm quail salad was fantastically light instead of heavy with oil.  Instead of dislocating a shoulder while hoisting the enormous wine book, I opted for one of the two convenient wine pairings (the cheaper $63 version) for the three savory courses. The pairing was a journey around the world with great explanations by the sommelier. The conservative pairings were consistently light compared to the food. The approach is the wine should be subordinate to the food. Boldness was neither for the food nor the wine.  Although the waiter was flippantly confident that our 7:00P reservation would allow plenty of time for a 9:30P curtain of \"O\", he was wrong. We arrived at the show on time, but had to rush through the petit fours and hustle through the casino.  The dining room was decorated with not just one Picasso painting, but many works using different mediums. Probably not a seat in the house that didn't have at least two Picassos in view. The one wall without artwork was the glass doors with a view of the dancing Bellagio fountains.  The attire is dressy with jacket preferred, but good luck enforcing that in Las Vegas. It's too bad. There are only a few times when playing \"dress up\" is encouraged - prom, red carpet events, and Vegas. Seize the opportunity instead of being too (casually) cool for school.  The restaurant is located downstairs from where the shopping area and the casino connect. Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime Steakhouse is next door. The simplest menu selection was four-courses for $118 with three to six different selections per course.  On my next visit to Vegas, I hope to slip into the bar for barrel-aged cocktails while gazing, not into my girlfriend's eyes, but at the large Picasso painting. Hey, she'd do the same thing.",

Very accommodating too, each person at the table can chose whatever they want, so you don't feel forced to commit to one menu for the table. Wine pairing included three pours that compliment the dishes well. Wine pairings also vary depending on the dishes you chose. Service was super friendly and upscale but not snobby (thanks Blake - from Madison, WI). There is a terrace view of the Bellagio fountains, which are a spectacular and worth the visit to the restaurant. Spacious interior with old-school fancy feel and classical music in the background.",

    "text": "After reading other reviews, and sneaking a peak at the menu, my wife and I were excited to dine at the Picasso on our last night in Vegas. Unfortunately, the food and the experience fell far below our expectations, especially when compared to a truly remarkable dinner the night before at Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier.   To start with, when we arrived for our reserved holiday dinner, we were told that the restaurant was running behind schedule and that there would be a 30-minute delay in seating us. We had planned the evening in advance and had purchased show tickets, so it was annoying to have to choose between missing a holiday dinner or being late to a show.   Nor were we offered a complimentary beverage or called when the seating became available. We simply came back in half an hour and were escorted to our seats, for a rushed and unimpressive dinner session. With exception of two dishes (tuna tartare and fois gras), the food was bland and uninspiring, though pretty to look at. The main course of prime filet mignon arrived with tepid mashed potatoes and cold mess of sauteed wild mushrooms which were supposed to top the steak. We were not assisted by a sommelier who would help us pair the wine with our meal, as in other restaurants. The entire experience lasted under an hour, and we felt rushed and ignored. For a hefty price tag of over $600, the entire experience was regrettable. We've had better dining under $40/plate at home.  Overall, the chef's lack of quality control was embarrassingly obvious. Whatever his creative vision was for this dinner service, its execution was a failure, at least at our table. I would have been ashamed to charge these rates for such an underwhelming meal if I was him.",

It all starts with aperitif drinks, followed by soup like you've never ever tasted, then superb salad, topped off by the main course, then finished with an outstanding desert, the like of which can not be found anywhere.

    "text": "In my first review of Picasso 6 years ago, I compared dining here to having a one night stand with a celebrity.    Well who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???  My wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!  You get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu degustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.    We're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their \"sauteed steak of \"A\" foie gras\".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complemented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.  The pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.    You basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P  Service was A++ from beginning to end and they offered us an extra dessert dish to celebrate the occasion.  We had such a great time that we ended up being the last ones in the place!",

Since they offered two menus, two of us decided to try each one in order to share with one another so we could experience as many dishes as possible.  The wait staff could tell that we wanted to enjoy our meal, so there was never any pressure to rush through each course.  Instead, they were quite friendly and accommodating as we attempted to pass plates and rushed over to pass them for us!  Everything we consumed was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection...our dinner ended up taking three hours.  The best part was that we received a complimentary croquette appetizer to start off our meal, dessert candies at the end of our meal and beautifully boxed palmier cookies as we left the restaurant!  I love unexpected free stuff :-)",

Having eaten at numerous high end restaurants (Restaurant Gary Danko, Eleven Madison Park, French Laundry, La Tour d'Argent, Le Bernadin, Per Se, Fleur de Lys) to name a few, I have never received such poor service as I did at Picasso Las Vegas.  The wait staff was completely disengaged from me the guest as well as the food.  They literally, dropped the plates off without any eye contact, with a cursory description of the dish as they were actually walking away.   The sommellier after providing the wine description, was completely dismissive when asked any question about the wine.  Apparently, no one but he could possibly have any knowledge or interest in wine. As our meal progressed, the only person that ever interacted with us with any interest or personality was the bus person.  The rest of the staff was so pompous and condescending, it ruined what should have been a delightful adventure in food, because the food itself was good.  ($400 for two before tax)",

When this restaurant was over at the Mirage it was much more cozy and quiet.  You would think by going to a nice, very \"upscale\" restaurant mid week on the earlier side that it would actually be quiet.  It was NOT.  The staff saw that we were visibly uncomfortable where we were seated and graciously offered to move us; a nice touch.  We thought the staff was excellent and the wine pairing superb.  Honestly, the food was good but not really worth the price.  We dine all over the world in the finest restaurants and this one just did not cut it.  Not just because of the noise level (and other patrons were visibly annoyed as well - it was one large table generating the noise and nothing that I noticed was done to curtail it) but the choices on the menu were quite limited (Andre's at the Monte Carlo has a much better menu and wine selection).  The staff was very professional but it could not make up for ambiance.  They need to reconfigure the restaurant into smaller sections and employ noise dampening measures.  Very disappointing especially for nearly $500!  I would expect that the servers will eventually leave as well since it was no fun for them either.  Spend your money elsewhere.",

The service was great, but the food was not worth what we paid for our meal.  The meal for 6 or us, which included the tip, came to $1,152.  We each had the 5 course meal.  My husband and I had only one drink each and the other couples did have wine.  When you hear the words 5 course meal, you think of a lot of food....forget it, we each had small cups of butternut squash soup, 2 tiny pieces of bread, one tiny goose liver that was \"not my cup of tea\", four pieces of lamb that were no bigger than 1 1/2\" and paper thin, and a tiny lava cake w/a scoop of ice cream....there was one more thing and I can't even remember what it was.  I felt this meal was a total waste of money.  If I won the lottery, I would never go back to this restaurant.   You pay for the service and atmosphere....the waiters are friendly and change the silverware after each course.....I sure hope the dishwashers get part of the tips.  If you want to impress someone, have lots of money, and have a small appetite, then maybe you might like it.  If you are like the majority of us who work hard  for everything we have, you will not feel you are getting your money's worth!!!!",

Standout dishes were the foie gras steak which was seared with an amazing crust, the poached oysters which were prepared with the most amazing vermouth-based sauce (seriously, I don't think I've ever tried as hard to get every last drop of sauce out of the half-shells and into my mouth), and the seared veal chop which was perfectly tender and juicy and served with a very light au jus.

We were there to celebrate mother's day (a party of four), and came out with a bill running over $850 (wine and taxes included), which is basically the most expensive dinner I've ever had.  We all had the prix-fixe menu (115/p) and the wine pairing that came with it (60 USD aprox p/p), where you get half a glass of a different wine each course. The wine pairing was not excellent, but good. Desserts, to my opinion, were not as nice as the rest of the meal which, granted, was superb.   Superb enough to warrant over 200 bucks a head? Well, it depends. Maybe not for the food alone, but remember you're also paying for the experience and, in that sense, it is a one of a kind experience to have dinner surrounded by a myriad of Picassos (there's one everywhere I could look at),  and a very classy ambiance.   No complaints at all for the service. Everyone was attentive and efficient.   My bottom line is: There's got to be food that is just as good as this for half the price, but this restaurant is worth trying once in a lifetime, during a very special occasion. As it goes, you only live once, right?",

    "text": "Fantastic, Beautiful, World-class, Foodgasm... these are just some of the words I'd use to describe Picasso. Before you read the rest of the review ask yourself do you think of eating at a restaurant as a journey as much as it is a meal? Do you appreciate the amount of effort that goes into the preparation of your meal? Do you appreciate the lost art of waitering (probably not a word)? Then do yourself a favor and reserve a table at Picasso if you're in town.   Starting with the food. Picasso is primarily focused on prix fixe menus. They offered four different prix fixe menus when we went in January 2015 for dinner. Two of the options were meat focused, the third was vegetarian inspired, and the fourth was a special menu that highlighted truffles. Make sure you take a peak at their website to see what they are serving if you're a particular eater because while you can customize your prix fixe menu a little bit there's not a whole lot of wiggle room. Also consider the price before you go since each prix fixe menu averages around $125 and some course options that require an additional upcharge on top of the prix fixe menu cost.   Okay with that being said, the food is amazing. The chef started us off with a little something to get us started (leak soup) before we started our first course and it was a lovely little starter to get the taste buds going. The first course was lobster salad and it was amazing. The size of the \"salad\" was approimately the size of a small biscuit and primarily consisted of lobster meat, Delicious. The second course was a scallop on top of mashed potatoes in a veal reduction. I don't even like scallops but this was delicious as well. The third course was frois gras and this was the show stopper. Let me preface by saying I love frois gras. My girlfriend isn't a huge fan but she came away loving this dish as much as I did. The fourth course was a perfectly cooked lamb dish. Lastly, the fifth course was dessert. She selected the fig stuffed pear, and I picked a hazelnut chocolate cake. Both desserts were amazing and a lovely way to end the meal. When they bring the check out they bring several truffles on a little platter that we thought was cute. Make sure you take your time through courses because even though the portions aren't extremely large on a course by course basis, we were stuffed after all of our courses.   Let me speak to the service now. The service at Picasso is one of if not the best service I've ever experienced in fine dining. Our main waiter took our order, offered wonderful suggestions, and accomodated us on our food allergies. Once we made our selections a runner would bring us each course as went and they described the dishes they placed in front of us beautifully. With the conclusion of each course we were given new silverware which I think is something that not enough restaurants do. By the end of our meal you gain so much rapport with your waiter that you wouldn't think twice about shaking his hand as you thank him for the experience.   The environment of the restaurant was upscale and elegant. The restaurant is pretty large and if you're lucky you'll have a seat facing the Bellagio fountains. I knew they had Picasso paintings here but I thought there would only be one. You'll find several of his works scattered throughout the restaurant so coming here is just as much a cultural experience as it is a meal.   Overall, I can't say enough positive things about Picasso. If you've made it this far in the review then I appreciate you reading but honestly you should just go. There's a reason why this place is rated so highly by the yelp community and even though it comes at a hefty price tag, dinging here is an experience no one should leave Vegas without. Think about it this way, a Vegas show could costs upwards of $80+/person for about 1-1.5 hours. This meal is a little more than that and will take up just as much time. Plus you'll get just as good an experience as a show. Definitely worth it. I know I'll be back the next time I'm in town. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best meals I've had in the continental US.  The wait staff, somellier, and bartender were all very knowledgeable about the things they needed to know about. They answered every question we had, the food was served well, well timed, just an excellent meal.  They were offering 3 prix fix menus that evening, one a special black truffle menu, where all of the dishes had black truffles. The other special that night was a kobe beef filet.  I ordered off of a prix fix menu where I got:  - Red bell pepper soup and quail (I can't recall how it was prepared) - Poached oysters topped with caviar - Filet of Sea Bass - Deer medallion with a horseradish garnish - Chocolate cake that probably took 9 years off of my life  Everything was flavorful and delicious, and the wine that was paired with each course was a perfect complement to the dish. The somellier took the time to explain where each wine came from, what it tasted like, and why it went well with the food.  I had never tried deer before, and by all accounts I've heard it's a gamey and tough meat. It tasted more gamey than - say - steak, but this deer was tender and delicious.  Excellent experience for the money, highly recommended. Visit Picasso when you're in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Of all the meals I've had in my life this is the first one in which every single course has been perfect. I ate here about a year ago and have only recently gotten around to writing reviews of all the restaurants I've been to; however, Picasso was first on my list. It's tucked away in a lower partition of the Bellagio, so it's easy to pass up on a quick walk-through.   We were seated at the outdoor patio overlooking the pond. This gives you one of the best views of the water show to be had on the strip. However you won't be able to view any of the artwork of the restaurant's namesake. If you walk around inside you can see many of the original Picasso works from several periods.   The staff was extremely polite and attentive as would be expected from a Michelin two star restaurant. The patio's head waiter was spot on for all of our needs.  I ordered the tasting menu and both of my friends opted for the vegetarian prix fixe. The somollier suggested a Riesling, so we ordered a bottle. He knew what he was talking about because it matched well with both my dinner and the vegetarian plates. Good job!  My amuse bouche was a lobster soup that was smooth and silky.  The U-10 seared scallops were large and perfectly cooked. The foie gras however was mind blowing.  My tongue was crying with joy and at the same time hated me.  I haven't had any before nor since that caused me to get emotional. The seared halibut was also fantastic and seated over a ragout of mushrooms. When dessert came we loved their presentation and the taste. I had a molten chocolate cake that oozed with goodness. My friend Liz had some some of strawberry... amazing... something rather. I wanted to steal it, but her glare let me know that this was not the place to start a fork battle.  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this restaurant to cap off a trip to Vegas. For three of us with wine, the check came out to be around $650, so budget accordingly. The dress code is dressy to business casual; though this didn't stop a group of people from coming in with shorts and flip flops while yapping on their cell phones the whole time, jerks.",

    "text": "The five stars is for the service. Wonderful service. Very attentive, courteous, knowledgeable, and chivalrous. The restaurants itself is amazing. The art is beautiful, and the view of the fountains is great. I like to think of eating dinner here as more of an experience than anything else. You will be treated in a way in which no other restaurant will treat you as the service is so personal. This, however is a typical \"fancy restaurant\" in which the food is on the smaller side. This is not a place you will walk out full as the serving sizes are just not enough in order to do that. However, the food was quite good. For my meal, I chose the quail salad, which was more of just quail rather than a salad. There were micro greens, but not enough to make a salad in my opinion. The quail was very good. It tasted oven fried. Seasoned very well. My second course was creamy asparagus. This came with an odd type of mushroom on top. I'm not a mushroom person at all, but these were amazing. The flavor and textures of this dish were done very well. My entree was the lobster. This was the least impressive of the plates I chose. There was not much depth to this dish. It was lobster with a type of creamy sauce with a few kernels of corn on my plate. I think some type of starch would have went well with this dish so to me, it was underwhelming. The mister got a lobster salad, which he said was good, scallops, which he loved, but there was just one. The foie gras steak, which he surprisingly liked, and the lamb. He was underwhelmed with his main course as well. He didn't think it was that flavorful. Overall this was a great restaurant. Yes, we have had better food, however the food here is really good, just not blow you away good. However, I like to think of Picasso as an experience, and for that, it is a 5 star experience. The \"better food\" that I speak of didn't come with the same experience as you have at Picasso, which is why this is a place that you should try at least once.",

    "text": "One of the best restaurants I've ever been to.  My second (and most recent) visit was not quite as good as my first visit, but the bar was set so high that criticisms must be viewed relatively. Picasso boasts an impressive decor, with original Picasso works lining the walls. The daily floral arrangements are almost equally impressive, and placed in the middle of the restaurant provides a very colorful and beautiful centerpiece. If you get a seat by the windows, you'll get a fantastic view of the water fountain show.  On to the food. I recommend the seared scallop, which on my first visit was PERFECT. The second time around the center was slightly undercooked, but given its size, I would think it's hard to maintain 100% consistency throughout. My highest recommendation goes to the foie gras, which was really exceptional. Seared just right, and extremely flavorful. But then again, who doesn't like something that fatty? Fat = delicious. Also, if the poached oysters are on the menu, GET THEM.  One thing I absolutely must point out is their wine selection, which is VERY reasonably priced, considering. A restaurant of that caliber could get away charging much more for a bottle of wine than Picasso does (and I've been to much lesser restaurants charging higher margins on their wines). I would say that on average, their wine prices are 180-190% of what you'd find retail in a wine shop. Example, 2006 Nicolas Catena Zapata Malbec/Cab ran $230 a bottle at Picasso. I would expect to pay $120 or so in a store. Picasso could get away with charging more, but they don't. That is just gravy.  Service is very attentive, but can be a little sassy. Our waiter teased us about the punctuality of the remainder of our dinner party. They of all people should know that when in Vegas, you gotta ride the hot streaks when they come, no matter if they're getting in the way of your dinner reservation.  You'll be looking at around $150 for the fixed menu (prix fixe), add some recommended wine pairings and you're looking at $250-300. The two prix fixe options that were offered during my second visit were $150 and $300 respectively.  In sum, this is among the best restaurants Vegas has to offer,",

At best other places give great service with 5 people serving you .  Picasso is the only restaurant who gives excellent service with one primary contact.     I had the prix fixe menu.  I had oysters with caviar (excellent, the caviar complimented the oysters wonderfully), boudin of lobster/shrimp/scallops (disappointing, shrimp overpowered the dish), fallow deer (excellent, the best dish of the night), the cinnamon apple tart (there was too much cinnamon).  Below are some tips at nice restaurants based on silly customers i watched:  1) DON'T ASK FOR MEAT MORE COOKED THAN MEDIUM-RARE.  They are going to give you the crappy meat.  When you overcook meat, you are not judging the meat quality, it all tastes the same. 2) ASK THE WAITER FOR GUIDANCE.  They know the entrees, they will help. 3) PUT YOUR CELL PHONE ON VIBRATE. 4) Ask the waiter where different meats come from.  It is a good differentiator to make yourself sound intelligent. 5) The wine pairings are essential on menu degustation or prix fixe meals.  Trust in the sommelier.",

But not ethereal, nothing to distinguish this place from other top dining venues.  I had the tasting menu- loved the lobster salad and enjoyed the scallop especially the mashed potatoes it was placed on.  The fois gras was mediocre, and the lamb was pretty disappointing.  It wasn't bad just not better than at a mediocre place.  Also did not like the Mexican flavoring of the lamb such as the beans and peppers- tasted like a dish I would get from Fresh Direct in NYC.  The apples crepes were delicious and the chocolate fondant was good although no surprises- it's your typical molten chocolate- it's good, not inspiring.  The tiny petit fours after the meal were delicious.  The Pom Passion cocktail I had tasted like medicine.   The service was wonderful except when the food came out the servers only described it with one word such as \"lamb\" and \"fois gras\"- you'd think a place like this would offer a bit more descriptive information on the cuisine... I had a nice dinner but not a particularly memorable one.",

Picasso saved the day!! Quality of food was great, and the view was spectacular! All the years I've been to Vegas I've never been able to see the fountain shows (due to lack of height and other's lack of courtesy) but I I finally did (I didn't know there were different songs and types of water display!) and in the best seat imaginable!! I've also never had Foie Gras, or Osetra... THANK YOU PICASSO!!! For totally making my dreams come True. Be prepared to pay for what you get. EXCELLENCE! =oD Blake our waiter was wonderfully fantastic and made me feel at ease right away. And Jose our attendent(?) was super wonderful too! Would I come back? YOU BETCHA!!! .. uh, maybe just myself next time so I won't have to share the Osetra! ;oD ***We each ordered the Degustation menu, with my Husband oppting for the wagyu beef entree ($40 extra), He had 1 cocktail, and I had the wine paring (husband helped me finish off the rest of the wines) and the Osetra Caviar appetizer with 'all the fixings'.  Diner was totally worth every single cent. They even give out parting favors. Ours were little banana chocolate chip muffins...Husband Loved those! =oP (I like my bananas raw/uncooked) Over all a dinning experience worth trying!!",

We ordered two different menus, so in all got a good sample of what this place is all about.   The first course: butternut squash soup for the hubby and lobster salad for me. Both were great. We agreed the meal was off to a great start. The lobster salad ended up being the best dish by the way.   The next course: big eye tuna and foie gras.  The tuna tartare lacked flavor , needed some serious pizazz . Foie gras was prepared with a thin crisp wafer and some type of soy sauce with a spoonful of mash potatoes. It wasn't bad.   Next was the entree: lamb chops and halibut-- big disappointments!  Not what we expected.  The flavors combined just didn't burst in your mouth-the way these meals are delicately prepared to do so. We weren't automatically digging in for a second bite .   Already feeling deflated, we ended the night with lackluster desserts.  Mine was the fried rice pudding -came with mangoes and tart mango sorbet. The other was a chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream. '   Nothing spectacular. The latter was better.

    "text": "Picasso is the first restaurant I've ever eaten at with 2 Michelin stars, and one can tell very early on that the level of service, sophistication and elegance is at the high end.  Although not necessarily hidden, Picasso is also not as front-and-center as some high-end Vegas eateries.  Although located in the beautiful (some might say ostentatious) Bellagio, you have to descend to the property's lower level to access Picasso.  Once inside, you are welcomed with a simple elegance only a restaurant of this stature could manage.  Seated, your eyes cannot help but be drawn to the *actual* Picasso paintings adoring nearly every wall.  One would be hard pressed to find a museum in North America with as many of the Master's creations.  Anyway, you must draw your attention from the paintings and look at the leather bound menu in front of you.  There are two options: 3 course prix fixe or 5 course tasting menu.  Since I'm not a trust fund baby or a venture capitalist, I opted for the 3 course meal.  Perfectly cooked fois gras and medallions of Fallow deer (otherwise known as venison) were the highlights.  Service was exceptionally professional and efficient, but also friendly and helpful.    Consistent with the European-centric cuisine, the enormous wine list is heavy on French and Italian wines, although the usual suspects from Napa are well represented.   Picasso is a quiet sanctuary from the craziness that Vegas can be.  While the ante for culinary supremacy in Vegas may have been raised by Joel Robuchon's utterly exorbitant outpost at the MGM Grand, Picasso is still among the top restaurants in the country and well worth your time and significant expendable income.",

    "text": "Beautiful restaurant with seating right in front of the Bellagio Fountains.  Amazing service that definitely Michelin Star worthy (do they still have those in Vegas).  My favorite coarse was the lobster salad, tasted very fresh with big chunks of lobster.  Surprisingly I liked it more than the seared foie.  I had high hopes for the foie since you can't get it in California and someone had told me they liked it better than the foie they had in France.  It was good (is foie ever bad?), but  my favorite preparation is still Gary Danko's.  All of the other dishes were solid, in fact I can't think of any that I didn't like.  The service was superb, very attentive.  As were were walking to our seats, nearly ever waiter we passed welcomed us to the restaurant.  Great evening, definitely made the night special!",

    "text": "After reading about Picasso, I was super excited to book this place for my bf's birthday & our two year anniversary while visiting Las Vegas. I've been to many high end restaurants including many with michelin stars and was hoping for the best service & food here.   Upon arrival we were greeted and seated outdoors so we can view the water show while having dinner. It was romantic, but it was so cold and they did not have gas/oil to turn on the outdoor lamps. When asked, they just said they couldn't turn them on since they were out of fuel. I was disappointed because I wore a nice dress here and wanted to enjoy the view while having a nice meal. Minus 1 star!  Based on the menu, I was hoping for declious dishes! My boyfriend & I ordered a variety of dishes, but the food wasn't consistent. Some came out cold, others warm. The warm dishes were tasty, but food left out cold, just doesn't taste well after a period of time. I remember the scallop being cold and chewy. Minus 1 more star!  I give this place 3 stars because their food wasn't all bad, the drinks were good, and the service was okay. For the amount we paid for our meal, we could've had a better meal. I probably will not come back here.",

    "text": "Prior to our short Las Vegas vacation, I researched a few fine dining establishments and decided on Picasso because of its positive reviews on Yelp and other websites and also for the Michelin stars which were awarded when Michelin still produced a guide for Vegas.   The restaurant is beautiful. I enjoyed the view of the Bellagio fountains and was amazed with the art. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They were attentive to our needs without being overbearing.  I had the degustation menu (Maine Lobster Salad, Scallops, Foie Gras, Lamb, and a pear dessert) with wine pairing. My boyfriend had the prix fixe menu (Warm Quail Salad, shrimp, fallow deer, and warm chocolate fondant) with wine pairing.   I highly recommend considering wine pairings at Picasso. In my opinion, the master sommelier did an excellent job pairing the wines to the different courses. The wines alone tasted ok; in fact a few were not appealing at all, I would use a spittoon if they had one. However, the wines with the courses made my dining experience so much better. For example, I typically do not like sweet wines but the Foie Gras with Tokaji Aszu was fantastic. I wouldn't let the boyfriend sample the dish. It was all mine.   I didn't rate the Picasso 5 stars because two of my courses, the lobster salad and scallops, were good....not great. I also did not care for the pear dessert. Perhaps we'll try Picasso again when the weather is warmer so we can sit on the patio.",

We decided to do the tasting menu and were very pleased.  Each dish was better than the last...and each was presented in a beautiful way that you almost didn't want to take a bite! My husband selected the meat dish for his entree and I selected the Halibut on top of asparagus. I've never tasted Halibut flashed fried like the one I had at Picassos.  The White and Dark Chocolate dessert was so good I used my finger to lick up the last melted piece.  We are looking forward to our next visit to Vegas just for another meal at Picasso!",

    "text": "Omg. This is the epitome of fine dining. Had the awesome opportunity to eat here for dinner with my boyfriend's ballin family and family friends for Christmas eve. First off, we had a beautiful view of the fountains at Bellagio. We ate dinner in front of dancing waterfalls and music, so it was like dinner and a show. Just absolutely beautiful.  So I've only been here just the one time (I'd be dirt poor otherwise), so I'm not sure what their menu is usually like. We had the prix fixe menu I think, and I remember having to choose between one or another. Both options were around $100 or more per person... So, either way, you know you're gonna get a whoppin meal. Was it a 5 course meal? 6? 7?? Honestly can't remember, but the dishes just kept coming.  We each got a complimentary shot of soup? It came with a small spoonful of salmon, caviar, and half a quail egg? So you eat that spoonful, down the shot, and bask yourself in the beauty that is your sense of taste. The soup was wonderful - creamy, yet light, and flavored in such a way that I don't... know what it is. But I would savor it to its last drop.  My course started off with some oysters topped with some fancy sauce and caviar. Omg. Super smooth. The oyster literally did a slip and slide down my throat, yet somehow leaving a trace of wonderful, clean flavor on my tongue that was just... blissful. I love oysters, and having it that way was amazing.  Uh. At this point, I don't remember what else my meal consisted of. Like I said, dish after dish after dish. And I shared some with my boyfriend, who shared some of his with me, so I got a little mixed up. There was some shrimp, some steak, some chicken, some scallop, foie gras... and I can't recall them in order but they were all FANTASTIC. This wasn't just regular food. It was seriously fine as hell.  Anyway, I would recommend this for sure to anyone and everyone (who's willing to drop some serious bucks).",

    "text": "My first experience at a five-diamond restaurant, and I'm glad I dined here.  Too bad not many other restaurants measure up.  Picasso set the bar high for me.  My boyfriend said it best, \"every bite made me sit back in pure delight.\"  Okay, maybe he didn't word it that way, but it's CLOSE to that.  You must do the tasting menu, ask for a seat by the window, so you can watch the water show while you enjoy dinner, and get the wine pairing with your meal.  You will be floored by each sommelier's knowledge of each bottle of wine.  Yes, they have a sommelier for each wine pairing.  Crazy.  Save up and make sure you don't drink too much so you can taste and savor the experience.\r \r -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r \r Update: 5/14/06\r \r We approached the maitre'd with confidence and purpose as we presented our reservation information.  He and his assistant could not find the information, but they immediately gave us the choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  We decided on dining al fresco, which comes highly recommended, because you can enjoy the water show with the music!  \r \r Once again the service was flawless, courteous, knowledgeable, professional and executed with grace.  We ordered from the degustation menu and had the wine pairing once again, great portions, and on the mark pairings.  I was especially impressed with the lobster salad and the strawberry confit empanada dessert.  Those were both delectable and I have found myself a favorite dessert!  \r \r Picasso continues to excel in food preparation, service and creates an ambiance that exudes 5-star dining.",

    "text": "I had pretty high hopes for this place and I was a little disappointed.   This restaurant is beautiful. The location offers a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains. Our party requested The Terrace but, due to a private party that evening we had to be seated inside. They seated us near a window which offered a great view. The place has several of Picasso's works which was really neat to see as I had never seen one prior to my visit.   The menu is a choice between a prix fix 5 course meal and a semi prix fix 4 course meal where you get to choose your entree and appetizer. I chose the corn chowder, red shrimp dish and the venison.  The chowder was very good but the shrimp was forgettable. The venison was outstanding. I had never had venison before so I decided that a restaurant of this caliber would be a great place to take a risk. I'm glad I did as it was perfectly seasoned.  The waiter warned me that it would be \"gamey\". Having no clue what this meant I opted to order it anyways and I'm still not entirely sure what \"gamey\" means. My dessert (chocolate cake) was pretty good.   One of my biggest pet peeves while eating out is when a meal isn't timed right. The first few courses came out quickly. Almost too quickly actually and one of my plates was cleared prior to me finishing it. I would guess we had our entrees within 40 minutes of sitting down...which is a pretty quickly paced for a 5 course meal. After dessert, the quick service halted. We waited and waited and waited for the server to come and take our dessert order. After he got the order, again, the plates came quickly. Then we waited several minutes for him to come back by, we asked for the check and waited a few more minutes for it to come. The server was very stiff and a little snooty for my taste. I know that, sometimes in restaurants of this caliber, the servers take their jobs very seriously (as they should) but I prefer someone who is a little more relaxed.   All in all, the place is stunning and the food was delicious. I would definitely try this restaurant again and hope for a little better service and more appropriate pacing of the meal.",

Beautiful floral arrangements, excellent service, wonderful food and a fabulous selection of single malt Scotch.  What's not to love?   I chose the three course with wine pairings and had...  Poached Oysters, garnished with Osetra Caviar, Sauce Vermouth --this was one of the most spectacular things I've ever tasted.   Creamy and sweet, with the slightly salty crunch of caviar.  Amazing.  Paired with a French white (Chardonnay/Chablis)  Ragout of Seasonal Vegetables with Fresh Foie Gras and Jus de Poularde --perfectly cooked crisp-tender bits of fresh tricolor beets, brussels sprout and other winter vegetables tossed with slices of seared foie.  Earthy and wonderful.  Paired with a light, floral Alsatian Gewurtz.  Milk Fed Veal Chop with Rosemary Potatoes ...    --juicy and tender, very delicate in flavor.  I could not even come close to finishing it all.    did finish the wine though... a Domaine Serene Pinot ...04 I beleive.  Oregon Pinot is always a weakness.   Dessert was a blueberry and lemon concotion featuring sorbet, mousse and a sort of ... deconstructed tart with paper thin crisp pastry cookies and not quite a lemon curd...thicker and richer.    It was really beautiful and light.  Again, I couldn't finish it all but it was delicious.  My dining companions dish of aged lamb was also a standout.  I was very curious about that and it was quite good.  Not at all gamey, just tender and rich.   I would urge anyone to try it.    I've not eaten everywhere in Vegas, but comparing it to the top notch places I've dined elsewhere... this has to be one of the best in the city.   I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Julian Serrano has done it again. Picasso is a Michelin two star restaurant and holds up to it's standards.  I recommend inside seating which incorporates the overall experience (actual Picasso paintings inside) as well as a view of the water show.  What made my experience was our server.  I forgot his name but he was knowledgeable with the menu, brought a delicious German Riesling as well as a white wine from Sweden which complimented each dish without being overbearing.  Both dangerous if I was left alone in a room with them!   We went with the Prix Fixe which changes seasonally.  For our first course we went with the Quail Salad and Pea Soup.  The pea soup was by far a great starter with pork belly (you can never go wrong with pork belly).    Next we went with the Foie Gras which was presented such as a \"thanksgiving\" approach with strawberry jam and croutons.  It went well with the bread that was passed out out the beginning of our meal.    For the third course we had the Wagyu and Deer.  The deer was cooked to perfection (I believe the chef recommended medium-rare or medium?). If you haven't had deer before, I might get chewed out for saying this but it truthfully tasted like a really well prepared steak if you're hesitant.  The braised wagyu short ribs were delicous as well.  If I had to choose between the wagyu or deer I'd go with the deer again.    For dessert I went with the warm chocolate fondant.  Trust me chocolate lovers, this is chocolate heaven!  It is also the only chocolate dessert in the selections given as they don't need to add another.   When we finished our dinner and prepared to walk out, we were given a complimentary box which happened to be a banana nut muffin for the following morning.",

    "text": "Wow.... just wow.  Picasso is a restaurant that just oozes class.  The best part is that the food and customer service are outstanding to match.  Picasso isn't your everyday restaurant, as suggested by its prime waterfront location in the gorgeous Bellagio resort.  The authentic, multi-million-dollar Picasso artworks adorning the walls are another giveaway that you're about to experience something spectacular at Chef Julian Serrano's flagship restaurant.  I visited Bellagio on a Saturday evening, armed with 5:30pm reservations.  The hostess was incredibly gracious and gave me a window seat overlooking the lake.  Perfect for front-row viewing of the half-hourly fountain shows.  The clientele skewed toward a very specific demographic -- mostly older Asian businessmen on dates with their (much, much younger) girlfriends or trophy wives.  I didn't really fit in, but I didn't let that faze me any.  After flipping through the encyclopaedic wine list and settling on a glass of Sauvignon blanc, I was all set.  There are several menus to choose from, including vegetarian and 4-course prix fixe menus. However, I decided that \"go big or go home\" would be my motto for the weekend, so I opted for the 5-course degustation.  This includes an amuse bouche at the start of the meal and petit fours at the end, so it's really a 7-course extravaganza.  Absolutely everything about my dining experience was phenomenal, and I'm still reminiscing over it with fondness:  **AMUSE BOUCHE** A shot of slivered almond soup with a pheasant croquette.  The soup was silky smooth, which contrasted nicely with the slivered almonds.  The pheasant croquette was crispy and light.  Both were packed with flavor.  **COURSE 1** Maine lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette.  Very fresh and complex.  Loved the addition of cantaloupe spheres.  **COURSE 2** Pan-seared U-10 dayboat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau.  Imagine the most perfectly cooked scallop you've ever had, sitting on the silkiest, smoothest, creamiest, and most decadent mashed potatoes you've ever come across.  That's *almost* as good as this dish was.  **COURSE 3** Sauteed steak of foie gras with toasted pisatachios and poached cherries.  Rich, luxurious, and amazingly cooked.  If you're feeling indulgent, you have to try this.  **COURSE 4** Sauteed filet of halibut with asparagus and Hollandaise.  This was probably the most traditional and straightforward dish of the night, but it was executed flawlessly.  Loved every flavor about it.  **COURSE 5** Pears poached in chai tea with panna cotta and chai tea ice cream.  The perfect ending.  A strong chai flavor connected all the elements.  Loved how the warm pears intermingled with the cold ice cream and perfectly textured panna cotta.  **PETIT FOURS** A tray of delectable handmade candies that included chocolates, jellies, truffles, and meringue.  Every single one was to die for.  After dinner was over and the check was paid, I felt so blissful that it was struggle to get up and leave.  But that's okay, because Picasso gives you a little something to go!  In my case, it was a gorgeous gift box with two individually wrapped mini muffins -- perfect for a breakfast snack the next morning.  Service is incredibly professional and gracious, with a whole team of servers tending to my table.  However, it was my server, Mitch, who really shined that day, making sure that every course was perfectly paced, every water glass was full, and every crumb was swept away between courses.  Another amazing surprise was receiving an email a few days later (from the general manager, Kelly M.) thanking me for my patronage.  I'm so blown away by a restaurant that cares so much about its guests.  What a night!  I don't know when I'll be back to Picasso, but I hope it's really soon.",

CHAPTER 3:   WHAT I LEARNED IN JUNIOR HIGH Inspired after reading about Pablo Picasso's legendary ways with women, I drew a beautiful pastel of a girl I had a crush on.  Surprising Tomiko with the portrait totally creeped her out and she never spoke to me again.  I learned that females are not impressed by something you spent hours creating in a basement.  CHAPTER 28:  I SEDUCE A WOMAN WITH ART I invited my sweetie to dinner at Picasso Restaurant.  Fine dining beside Bellagio's synchronized fire-hydrants while surrounded by 50 million dollars worth of genuine Picasso paintings appears to have a certain effect on women.  The coveted table #34 has the best view of said fountains.  Using the opportunity to charm my sweetie with my knowledge of art, I explained that the colorful squiggles on the dinner plates were identical to the Picasso designs I'd seen at Museu Picasso in Barcelona.  I also freestyle-critiqued a few of the paintings on the walls (secretly, I couldn't name any of them).  As we enjoyed the magnificent meal, I commented that Chef Julian Serrano is like an artist, then immediately regretted making such a banal comparison.  My sweetie was too deep in a state of rapture to care.",

A total downer for a 4.5 star yelp rated restaurant, that is located at one of the best hotels in Vegas.  I am vegetarian so I ordered the five course vegetarian menu for $143. The menu was not printed out, and the waiter had to spell it out for me. There you go, for a first impression. The vegetables had no flavor and were not fresh. Not to mention the third course was a cold ravioli soup with asparagus, quiet an old dish, again no flavor.   My mom ordered the veal dish- medium well. It came out all bloody and gross and she did not even eat it. Ended up going home with no dinner.  I expressed my disappointment to the waiter, and he seem to not care nor did the manager.  They took my drink off the bill but I somehow ended paying for my horrible meal, which was not cheap.  I will NEVER return to this place---total disappointment and horrible service!",

    "text": "I did expect the price to be unreasonably high, but I dared to take the plunge and sought incredibly delicious fancy schmancy food at Picasso.   Too bad the food sucked.  What I liked: The window and outside seating have a great view of the Bellagio Lake fountain show. The service was polite and attentive. The Poached Oysters were tasty (and the only item that I liked).  What I didn't like & why I will not return: The story: The menu has only 2 fixed price courses (WE DID BOTH, so we tasted most of the main course items offered on the menu).  In course #1 you can make a choice out of two options for both the final course plate and desert.  In course #2 you can make a few more choices.  Most of the items were just OK: timid Lobster Salad, one scallop on mashed potato and gravy (weird), and underwhelming lamb chops.  How about that Roasted Pigeon?  I've had more exciting Peking Duck at Chinese restaurants.  The short: The food was all image and no flavor.  The Foie Gras was especially disgusting; every bite was like an explosion of greasy fat.  Remember walking at the park with all those geese?  The Foie Gras is the liver from those little pooping guys.  Other notes: The food is really rich, even though the portions look fairly small, and a full course is more than enough food for one person. The ladies will get a complimentary small box of desserts. The French dining experience is typically long and relaxed, so don't go here if you only have 1 hour to eat.  The photos of the food look cool, but what were you positive reviewers thinking?  However, it is possible on the night I visited the chefs were replaced by raving circus midgets.",

Two months ago was my second time dining here.  The first was when I was a mere teenager and unaware of degustation menus.  Now as a proclaimed foodie, I'll have to say that this restaurant made me loovee foie gras, pigeon, 30 year old dessert wine, and fine dining even more!  If anything, sitting feet away from the Bellagio fountain and Picasso paintings make the $200/person meal almost worth it!  Sorry that I am not more descriptive of the food but I sure am a sucker for the ambience.  The highlight was being able to take photos of Picassos!  No museum in the world would allow you to do that with flash...",

    "text": "My cousin and I came here for dinner before heading over to watch the Lion King Show at Mandalay Bay. We were on a time crunch and warned the waiter. He told us we had plenty of time, but 30 min before we had to leave, he realized we didn't have much time left. We barely had time to finish our dessert, but they were nice enough to put it in a box for us to enjoy later (even though it turned mushy and lost its aesthetic value). I had lamb which was good. The foie gras was a little too fatty for me, so I had to eat it with bread. The waiter would come around and offer 3 different types of bread. I'd leave the crust on my bread plate...which looked really gross at such a nice restaurant. BUT if i ate it, I'd be full..and I needed the bread to pair with my foie gras. Eventually I had a plate of bread crust on the corner of my table. I asked one of the waiters for it to be taken away because it displeased my eyes.   Anyways, back to the food. My cousin ordered kobe beef for an extra $100. He was looking forward to it, but was slightly disappointed. He thought the meat was too fatty...but isn't kobe supposed to be fatty? I don't know. He enjoyed everything else though!   Service was excellent, as expected at such a restaurant. My cousin has dined at many exquisite restaurants, and he said the service and food here does deserve 5 stars. I, on the other hand, haven't dined at many nice restaurants. So Picasso was a fantastic experience for me.   Oh yea, we also got a great view of the fountain. Even though we didn't get a seat right by the window (days in advance reservation), it was still a pleasant dinner. On our way out, they handed out boxes of petite crackers and chocolates, that was really cute.   Too bad I'm not of age yet, otherwise I'd order the meals with the wine pairings. Hah. The couple next to us ordered their meal with wine pairings and it looked like they enjoyed it.",

First course: Maine lobster salad.  I really adore lobster, so this was a favorite.  Tiny morsels of avocado and melon added a fresh complement.  Second course: Pan-seared scallop.  The menu says \"scallops\" but one should not be surprised when a single scallop comes plated on a plouf of potato puree with a splash of veal juices.    Third course: I substituted sauteed prawns for the foie gras steak.  I generally pass on avian liver, but the shrimp was fairly unremarkable.  I suppose at the end of the day, there are only so many ways to prepare prawns.  Thank goodness for the wine pairing which kept things interesting!  Main course: Sea bass with asparagus.  Some of the most light and flaky fish I've ever had.  Small portion size, but extremely enjoyable.  Dessert: Chocolate truffle beignets.  The peanut butter ice cream was a tad too salty for my taste, but the chocolate beignets were outstanding.  The warm chocolate center was a pleasant contrast to the crispy fried casings.  Petite Fours: Arrived on a tray, but went untouched by our party.  Take Home Treat: Cinnamon cookies.  By the next afternoon they were going stale.  Came wrapped in a beautiful orange box.  Final damages: $1025 pre-gratuity.  Included dinner and dessert for 6, sparkling water for the table, five cocktails, two wine pairings, and the other intangibles (excellent service, flexibility for menu substitutions, high-class atmosphere amidst expensive artwork and a front-row seat for the Bellagio fountain show!).",

My fiancee and I both ordered the prix fixe dinner.   Here's what I ordered:  1) The butternut squash soup was a perfect balance of hearty, savory, creamy, and slightly sweet. The presentation with the marshmallows and mushroom bits was fantastic.  2) The foie gras tasted like butter, delicious meat butter. It was complimented by a sliver of toast and a plate of sweet and crunchy fruit.   3) The Kobe beef fillet was melt-in-your-mouth good with mushrooms and a moat of reduced red wine sauce surrounded by mashed potatoes with a dollop of horse raddish. I'm salivating just thinking about it.   4) The dessert, which was a chocolate bonbon surrounded by a whole plate of goodies, was to die for.  And the little somethin' extra: As we were chatting with Roger, our amazing waiter, we mentioned that we were seeing Cirque du Soleil's \"O\" at what we thought was 10:30. His face looked a bit worried and he informed us that the show was at 10:00. It was 9:55 and we hadn't gotten to our dessert yet. Without a hint of irritation or disdain, Roger saw to it that we received our dessert and the bill as quickly as possible. We felt so bad that we had to rush out, because the experience was one that is best when you take your time.   Oh yeah, and if you sit by the windows, you can watch the Bellagio fountains. It's been almost a week since we ate there and I'm still thinking about the food. Well done, Picasso. And thank you, Roger, for being awesome.",

The venison was a little tough, but still very well balanced as a dish in terms of flavors.  Service is efficient, accurate, and largely quick, if a little on the chilly side.    I'm very disturbed to see that they haven't updated their prix fixe menu or even their amuse bouche in the last year or so, though... perhaps they should look into that??  Still, 5 stars, at least compared to the other top-shelf options in Vegas.",

The cuisine was prepared beautifully, delecately seasoned, with little surprises around every corner (ie. boiled bone marrow up top my venison). The staff was attentive and caring. The sommelier was the best part of the dinner! With each dish was a perfectly paired wine along with a in depth explanation of the wine and why it was chosen for that dish. That sommelier will forever hold a place in my heart for introducing me to one of my all time favorite wines, Hungarian Royal Tojkai (which was paired with foie gras). Overall the experience was so lovely, especially being able to dine in the presence of such amazing works of art, anyone looking for an ultra luxurious Vegas dinner should try Picasso's.",

We saw The Beatles Love Show (Cirque du Soleil) and then headed over to the Bellagio to dine at this fantastic establishment.  The food was out of this world amazing. I am so impressed at how attentive the waitstaff was and how delicious our meals were. We ended up having one of the best dinners of our relationship there, we felt so relaxed and happy in the moment.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates fine dining. Cheers!",

When a dinner for 3 is running you over $1k you would think that the chef and restaurant wouldn't want your pallet ruined by the wafting stench of cigarettes through your entire meal. I had the truffle menu which was OK. Other members of my party's selections were phenomenal. I don't think I can ever look at a regular steak the same again after having the Japanese Wagyu Filet.",

I had the 4 course meal and it was almost outstanding! I had the oysters which were heavenly. for the second course I had the salmon which was ok but not wow, but my friend had the scallop as the second dish and it was just heaven in my mouth. Third course came out as halibut which was very well prepared and the fourth course was the peach and ice cream, but I think it is not just the food, it is a combination of food, decor, atmosphere, service and of course company that made this place an outstanding dining experience for me! If you are wondering, the bill came out to be around $360 for two people... a little TOO much! ;)",

    "text": "My boyfriend treated me to this gem of a restaurant tucked away in Bellagio for my birthday over an year ago (yes, a much delayed review). With an outdoor terrace situated directly next to the Bellagio fountains and a beautifully decorated interior embellished by Picasso paintings, this double Michelin star awarded restaurant is a delectable treat of near perfection. BUT, be prepared to spend quite a hefty sum in order to experience dining here.  Rating: 5 stars  AMBIANCE: Very romantic, sophisticated, upscale, and high class. Beautiful paintings hanging on the walls, an immaculate and grand (but not pretentious) interior, and I always love seeing flowers incorporated into table settings.  SERVICE: Cannot review Picasso without mentioning the impeccable service. The waiters are all very sincere, attentive, and charming and the excellent service enhances the overall experience.  FOOD: Bf and I both ordered the Prix Fixe Menu with Sommelier's wine pairing. The wine pairings were exceptional and the pairings really heighten the flavors of every dish.  To start off, as if the restaurant itself wasn't displaying enough Picasso artwork, the butter comes out with \"Picasso\" engraved on it. I've been to my fair share of fine dining experiences, and rarely do I see butter that personalized...not just your usual stick/cup/ball of butter, but it makes it hard to eat because you just don't want to touch it...  The rest of the meal can really only be explained in photos as they were all such delectable treats. Started off with the pea soup (lovely texture, rich pea flavor and smooth, just the way I like it and more), then the sauteed ruby red shrimp (a wonderful burst of flavor accentuated by the piquillo pepper vinaigrette), then the sauteed center cut filet of swordfish (perfection taste-wise, but I wish plating was a bit more creative), and finished off with the beggar's purse (a gorgeously plated risotto chocolate chip pudding, coconut macaroon, and banana-passion fruit caramel sorbet). The chocolate fondant was delicious as well, but I definitely preferred the beggar's purse (such a creative dessert!).  Overall, food, wine, and service were all over and beyond my expectations! And it helps that they gave a box of cookies for my birthday...a little something to remember the Picasso experience ;)",

My husband had never seen the fountain show at the Bellagio (I don't know how since he's probably been to Vegas more times than I have) so I asked for a table outside on the patio.  It was beautiful out there but COLD.  They had heaters but had run out of propane so we sat out in the cold.  Not good for such a high-class restaurant.  I had the 5-course meal and my husband chose the 4-course meal, mostly because he objects to foie gras.  I do too but I wanted the filet mignon and the only way I could get it was to choose the 5-course meal.  The filet mignon, by the way, cost an additional $150 on top of the $125 for the 5-course meal.  The food was all delicious, especially the scallop appetizer.  The filet mignon was delicious but again, not sure if it was worth the additional cost.    Service was great, as expected in a fine dining establishment.  Oh and the give you a box with 2 tiny muffins when you leave.  Not sure why but it was nice.",

I've had the pleasure and displeasure of dining at Picasso with such a millionaire friend as well as on my own terms as a lowly medical student who was simply trying to have a good time with someone she's head over heels with. When I came with Dr. Wong et al, the waiter and sommelier spoke to me as if I knew a thing or two about food-- that is, with a kind of respect that foodies like me deserve! When I came with my party of two (granted we look like two young kids), I was treated as if I would have white fish with cabernet sauvignon and that I would be a poor tipper. Refer to the buzzfeed video done on this very issue.  Anyhow, with the classist service aside, what's not to love foodwise here?? I mean, this place only has two Michelin stars and a shit load of foie gras. Foie Gras-- good! Truffle -- good! $300 Kobe steak -- great!  Oh of course, there's a spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains! Well, Picasso, I'll bear your snooty attitude time and time again for your delicious food. Next time, can you make like Joel Robunchon and send a limo to my average Henderson neighborhood -- cause ya know, not all of us live in Summerland, Anthem, or Seven Hills.",

The cocktails match the setting, creative and well-executed. Very enjoyable.   If you eat meat, the tasting menu is beautiful. Well-crafted, balanced, the most exclusive ingredients and beautifully executed.   For the same price, they offer a vegetarian tasting menu. Don't do it. It's a series of relatively weak dishes. I could write out each course now and dissect, but just know that my main was Chinese eggplant and it wasn't good.   The desserts were amazing, hats off to the chef. But unfortunately, I was so full of the chinese eggplant that I couldn't fully enjoy it.   I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 only because I'm a vegetarian and they should either: improve the menu, or reduce the price, or both. I'm heading back to Nobu for their veg tasting menu, same price, and much much much better.",

Still good but we couldn't finish it. - Earl Grey Cheesecake: Cheesecake was good but the sherbet was amazing!   All in all, a nice variety of dishes.

When we arrived we were seated quickly.  The space is pretty awesome.  Actual Picasso's on the walls!  It even has a view of the bellagio fountains if you pick the right seat.  We did not.    Unfortunately when we showed up it was not that crowded, most of the tables around us were empty and stayed that way throughout most of our dinner.  We were seated behind this giant buffet type table in the middle of the room.  It had gorgeous flowers but was also the place that had the water bottles for the servers.  Our seats were besides one another, I guess to see the fountain beyond it but they were completely hidden by the flowers.  So we ended up just watching the serving staff.    We did the tasting menu with the accompanying wine pairing.  The sommelier was extremely friendly, even changing up the wine pairing a bit for us when we told him we preferred red wine.  Honestly ever other staff person besides our actual waiter was polite, professional and friendly.  The food was really good though not exceptional, which is what we had come to expect from Vegas restaurants, particularly at that price point.    I'm not sure that I would recommend this place, nor go back anytime soon.  However, if we know someone that just loves Picasso they would probably really enjoy it for the theme alone.",

The food, service, and scenery were all amazing. Some of the highlights were the Scottish Salmon with Cauliflower Puree, Veal Chop, Roasted Pigeon, and the Quail Salad. We had seats right in front of the Bellagio Fountains which made the atmosphere extremely relaxing and peaceful. I could not have asked for a better birthday dinner. If you don't mind spending a bit of money for a wonderful experience I would definitely recommend Picasso for any occasion. I can't wait to go back. *Traveled here May/2017",

    "text": "Great Italian restaurant in Vegas!   We had a dinner for party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their courses as well as wine!   I personally had: baked oysters w/ caviar -  amazing combination with a hint of lemon, chilled foiegras w/ a piece of toast - very rich taste (might be a little to mich for 1 person, since I got full after this course, but if I went there with my husband it would a good option to  share this appitazers course), dear for the main course - perfectly cooked, we have the best wine paring for this course , and of course desert. I was pretty full by then but I still enjoyed the taste.   Overall I loved Picasso's interior, atmosphere, service and little details, so I will definitely be back some day.  I miss Vegas already :)",

    "text": "The restaurant itself is romantic with dim lighting, Picasso artwork and a view of the Bellagio fountains. There's outdoor seating as well but since it was February we opted to sit inside. As we were being led to our table I asked the hostess if there was a window table available and she said they were all booked but during our 2.5 hour dinner there were several empty tables which did not make sense to me. Ask in advance if you would like to sit next to the window.   The bread service at this restaurant is unique, a server comes around with a tray of 3 breads to let you choose which ones you want. To my surprise the server came back a second time with more bread which we happily devoured. The raisin bread was our favorite!  Menu Degustation--5 Courses for $128  0. Amuse bouche--Tasty fried croquette and savory soup 1. Maine Lobster Salad--Nice chunks of fresh lobster but I dislike the use of truffle oil which is artificial and could have been omitted 2. Pan Seared U-10 Boat Scallop--Perfectly seared scallops on a bed of mashed potatoes. No complaints about this one.  3. Sauteed Steak of \"A\" Foie Gras--The foie gras was lukewarm. If they had heated this more thoroughly this dish would have been good. The poached pear went well with the fatty foie gras.  4. Roasted Tournedo Loin of Colorado Lamb--Lamb was underseasoned and the vegetable pairing was not good. I thought this would be a tender cut of lamb but I really had to saw through it.  5. Chocolate Bread Pudding--Interesting take on bread pudding. I really loved the tart passionfruit puree with this.  6. Warm Chocolate Fondant--The molten chocolate cake had a perfectly gooey center and was  not too sweet. (Each person can choose a different dessert as part of the tasting)  Lastly, my boyfriend really liked the cocktails. These were $16 cocktails but very much worth the price. As we saw later in the trip we paid more for mediocre cocktails at L'Atelier.   As an extra treat, when the server brought us the bill he also brought us petit fours to sample. And when we walked out we were presented with mini chocolate chip muffins in a Picasso box by the hostess.   If you are looking for a romantic fine dining option in Vegas that is still affordable I highly recommend this place. This restaurant deserves its 2 Michelin Stars! The experience was worth the price!",

    "text": "I heard good things about the ambiance and food at Picasso from a friend.   Let's start off with some good: When making reservation, the host was very nice. She asked what the occasion was and explained to me the pros and cons of indoor and outdoor seating. Lastly, she also asked about our dietary restrictions (this is a sore point later) and I told her that we cannot eat pork.  When we arrived at our reservation, they quickly found my name and our table was ready, we took a few pictures by the paintings and the host and greeter were very friendly and helpful.   Once we arrive at our tables, this is when the bad experiences began. After we were sitting, we were waiting an awkwardly long time before anyone acknowledged we were there. After we finally got our menus, we ordered and butter was left on our table but no bread was offered. I was busy enjoying the ambiance with my girlfriend that I did not even notice the butter and bread until she mentioned it. At this point, the waiter brings out a complimentary dish from the chef, which had some kind of soup, pastry, and prosciutto (pork). Luckily, the waiter describes every item served to us and my girlfriend immediately notices that he said prosciutto and asks the waiter if that is indeed pork. He tells us that it is, and she informs him that we cannot eat pork but it is just a strip of pork so she can just put it to the side. This upset me because what is the point of asking me of our dietary restrictions if you're just going to ignore it. I trusted a 2 Michelin star to follow through if they ask about dietary restrictions. I then proceed to ask the waiter for bread and double checked whether the dishes were ordered had pork and he informed me that the prosciutto was the only pork in the restaurant.   We finally do get our bread, at the same time as we receive our appetizers. The rest of the meal went very well, the food was unique and delicious and we were seated at a good spot indoors where we could still see the fountain show. Once we arrive to dessert, I am met with another issue. The waiter brings out the dessert menu and shows it to my girlfriend and says \"this is our dessert menu, no pork here\" and gives us a smile. Now I will say I am not a prude, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he was just joking, but I think it is HIGHLY inappropriate in this situation. If we had a serious allergy to pork, would he make the same kind of joke?  After we finish our meal, I request to speak to the manager. I did not complain about the long wait time for our menu or the lack of bread because I can give the staff the benefit of the doubt and say perhaps they were very busy with a table to give us a menu, and the person serving the bread definitely seem like he was on the go non stop all night filling water and bringing bread. I DID complain about the dietary restriction issue and frankly the manager's response was disappointing. She apologized for the mistake and acknowledged that my point of \"if you're going to ask dietary restrictions, then ignore it, then you might as well not ask at all\" and that she will make sure it doesn't happen again.   Frankly, this is a disappointing response. For a 2 Michelin star meal at this price, the customer experience recovery was lacking. It would have been nice if she offered to comp our single glass of wine or an extra dessert for the trouble, but she just couldn't be bothered.   I had a bad experience at Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak at the Mirage where my steak was significantly smaller than my friend's who ordered the same steak, and the manager offered to give our table free desserts as thank you for understanding. I have been repeat customers there ever since. At Picasso, my opinion and experience clearly doesn't matter. As nice as the food and ambiance is, the service and service recovery is just so disappointing.",

The wine pairings were spot on for each dish and really complimented the food.  Lovely European styles of both whites and reds.  The service was thoughtful, careful and not intrusive in any way.  The setting was absolutely spectacular with original Picasso pieces and Bellagio water show   If you are a fan of modern art, this is the place to be.  Definitely a special occasion/destination dinner.  I would avoid trying to rush a meal in before a show, as the experience (and price) is an event in and of itself.

We were excited to dine here for months since our experience at Olives (comparable fine-dining restaurant in Vegas) was so wonderful!  Our experience at Picasso started off with the utmost attention to detail and enjoyable conversation at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender was purely delightful and his drinks were truly FANTASTIC! Our first impression at this point was stellar. We soon were sat down at our table. The restaurant itself and ambiance it creates are one-of-a-kind and nothing short of a Michelin rated restaurant.  We were suggested to dine off of their recommended prix fixe menu and we gladly obliged as they informed us some of the items have been on the menu for over 19 years! After the amuse bouche, neither of us were impressed but we were still optimistic for the rest of the courses. Unfortunately, the rest of the courses were mediocre at best, definitely not deserving of a 2 Michelin star rating.  I can't even tell you what I ate, one because it was so dim and I couldn't really see the food but also because nothing left a lasting impression. It is almost sad to admit but I truly believe the best part of the food was their bread & butter.  Overall, to our opinion the food is bland but I think a lot of reviews already speak to that. Such a shame for this beautiful and elegant restaurant to be hindered by the weakest link of its core - the food that it serves.",

    "text": "My husband and our married couple friend (don't have too many of those haha) wanted to grab a nice dinner before seeing O in the Bellagio. I set up the reservations about a week in advance via Open Table. I mentioned about seeing O at 7pm and figured 5:30 reservations should be plenty of time. It wasn't but see below for more information.   Upon entering I wish I had requested outdoor seating. The view of the fountain would of been amazing and I could see a little from our table. Just something to note if you are making reservations which are a must!  The first thing we tried was a shot of soup. I don't remember the name of what it was but it was given to our table without being on the menu. It was like a chowder of sorts. We also enjoyed some warm delicious bread and butter. I swear I had 2-3 pieces and didn't care. Good carbs??  Our first course came out andI had ordered the Poached Oysters - garnished with Osetra Caviar, Sauce Vermouth. I thought they were only okay and tasted very fishy. Gross! My husband had the Creme of Parsnip Soup- Rock Shrimp and Coulis of Curry. I honestly wasn't a fan but it was his favorite thing about the meal.  The second course was my favorite part of the meal. Big Eye Tuna Tartare Mashed Avocado. OMG my tastebuds were signing to the heavens over this deliciousness that entered my mouth. My husband ordered the Sauteed Filet of Chilean Sea Bass with Cauliflower Mouseline and Saffron Sauce. This honestly was just meh and glad I had ordered my tuna tartare.   The third course I had ordered the Sauteed Filet of Scottish Salmon Mashed Celery Root and Oxtail Jus. The salmon was good and not overcooked. I could easily use my fork to cut the salmon up into bite size pieces. The salmon meal reminded me of Coastal Flats salmon in the DC metro area. My husband ordered the Sauteed Medallions of Fallow Deer Caramelized Green Apple and Zinfandel Sauce. The deer meat wasn't very gamey which is always a plus. I thought it was just meh as well as my husband.  Last but not least was my favorite part, dessert. I was undecided on what to get but my decision was the best since the whole table ordered something different to try.  My deliciousness very rich desserts was theHazelnut Joconde- Gianduia Mousse, Vanilla Frangelico Ice Cream, Chocolate Covered Hazelnuts. Also our table was given a small dessert tray of different chocolates. I think this was an added bonus due to the fact that our table was celebrating our anniversaries.   As we were leaving we were given a special treat to take with us as a Thank You. It ended up being a banana bread soft cookie. It made a great late night snack.  Customer service was beyond 5 stars here. I would come here again on this alone. Granted it was an expensive meal even if it was pre pix menu. My husband wasn't happy with his choices but I was pleasantly surprised with most of mine.  My issue was setting up the reservations for 5:30pm and noted the fact that our table was seeing O at 7pm through Open Table comments. We didn't leave the place until 6:59pm. We had to run across the Bellagio to get to the theater and then have to go to the bathrooms that were located on the second floor. We started to miss a little bit of the beginning of the show which was okay since nothing too amazing was happening. It was still annoying all the same. I hate being late!",

Fantastic food, incredible stuff, a wonderful view to behold beautiful food being crafted before your very eyes with such precision and intricacy. Every single freaking bite at this place makes you feel like you never ate before. The chef is incredibly talented, but friendly and conversational, very pricey but it's definitely worth every penny. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm spoiled, but I expected more.   Our waiter was truly delightful.  Maybe one of the best I've had.  Charming, engaging and attentive.   Our bus boys were also quite good.  The sommelier however has a wee bit of attitude and had to be searched out more than once if we wanted a top off.   And even though we didn't spent 1000 on a bottle of wine, I think their bottle prices still demand a bit of attention.   But if you don't want to be attentive then leave it table side.  You know?    The ambiance was also lovely.   The setting changes made me a bit dizzy and I did wonder if the amount of water this place went through washing dishes was the reason lake Mead is so low  watching the fountains was an added bonus but be forewarned when the explosives go off a few of us were shot out of our seats.    Now to the food.   The appetizers were lovely and delicious.   I might not have put the chip under the scallop as that made the bottom of it mushy.  On the other hand the toasted brioche should have been under the foie gras to have time to soak up some of the lovely grease and juice.   The flavor of both was still great though and the foie gras was perfectly cooked.   The added price for the iberico ham (on special) was worth it.   The lamb however was not a hit.   Super tender, but over salted.   And then in contrast the roasted root vegetables with it had no flavor and were a bit pasty. A little garlic even would have helped?  The chocolate fondant dessert was back to five star, just way too much after all the previous courses and disappointing not to finish.  And then they brought us cookies or petit fours which the waiter quite kindly boxed up.  Haven't tried any of the other supposedly good French restaurants around. Be forewarned it's not a place for light eaters, and even if you are ravenous it's still a lot.  This ones nice for an elegant special night out.  It was good, but I honestly expected a little better from a Michelin two star.",

The restaurant is flourished with Picasso art and has a beautiful display of floral arrangements.  It felt comfortable and inviting.  Our table was located 2 tables away from the glass windows facing the fountain.  The food selection was limited, but each choices sound delectable.    Price per person with drinks can be about $150+ per person.   My favorite dish was the poached oyster for my appetizer.  It was delicious.  It taste like heaven.  We did experience something that was a little bit upsetting which was receiving a piece of plastic in my husband's foie gras pate.  It was the last bite in his appetizer course and we had told our server.  They had offer to get him something else but we didn't want anything more as our entree was coming.  They did take off the tab for that appetizer.  The dessert was a bit disappointing and we thought it was too sweet.  We did enjoy the restaurant and the staff.  Would like to come back again when I am in Vegas.  Recommend for dates, special occasions. Make Reservation!",

    "text": "Short review: This was by far the most delicious food I have ever put into my mouth.   Long review: So my boyfriend and his family invited me to fly out to Vegas with them for Thanksgiving. Obviously I said yes, or we wouldn't be here. Anyway, boyfriend decided he wanted to take me out on a nice date, so he googled \"best restaurant in Vegas\", and Picasso popped up. It's at the Bellagio, overlooks the fountains, and has priceless paintings hanging all over the place. This place sounds legit. OH and did I mention he took me to see my childhood idol, Celine, afterward? Talk about a catch.  So anyway, now I'm super stoked for literally the fanciest date I have ever been on in my life (I'm a poor graduate student, I don't get out much). We dress up fancy, play some craps ahead of time, then head to the restaurant. Right off the bat, we are treated like royalty, probably because we looked DAMN good. There was a noticeable difference in service between people who dressed up and people who rolled up in jeans.   We get seated outside, which is on this little terrace right by the little lake that shoots the fountain show. Talk about GORGEOUS. They even have some heat lamps if you get chilly. We told our server we were trying to make a show, and they had it timed SO PERFECTLY we were out of there at the precise minute we told him we needed to leave. I was super impressed.   Now onto the food. OH my god, the food.   First, we choose a nice bottle of champagne. Boyfriend chose the third cheapest so as not to look like the commoners we are, which was still over $100. Oh my gosh.   We got three options for dinner- the truffle menu, which sounded delicious but was $400 per person. No thank you. Second option was the Prix something, and third was the Prix Fixe, which we got. There was only a $10 difference between the Prix options, which were $130 and $120, respectively.   Each menu comes with a TON of stuff, though. You get to choose between two or three plates per course, with the exception of dessert, where there is an entire list to choose from.   Before we got any of our food, we got a surprise \"I'm testing new dishes, have a taste for free\" snack. It was a little mozzarella stick looking thing, but wasn't cheesy, with a little shot glass of soup. OH MY GOD, IT WAS SO GOOD. We also got our choice of four different types of bread, all of which were delicious.   For our first selection, I had autumn squash soup with crab chunks in it. It came out in a bowl with a little crab cake in the bottom, and the server poured the soup on top. It was delicious. Bae had the quail salad, which was a tiny tuft of grass and like, four quail legs cooked to perfection. Not exactly what I would call a salad, but delicious none the less.   Second selection, I had the Fois Gras, because I have always heard it was fancy but never had a chance to try it. It was surprisingly delicious, a nice pate of who-knows-what duck bits, served on a crispy toast round. Yum.   For the main course, I had deer. DEER! It tasted kind of like steak but a little wilder. Delicious. It was especially delicious if you chopped up the apricots that came with it and put them on top. Yummmmm.   Now dessert... OH dessert... boyfriend had the peanut butter s'mores dish and it was to die for. I had a berry tart that was served with the most delicious earl grey tea ice cream I have ever had. BUT THEN we get ANOTHER surprise plate of snacks, with like, seven bite sized samplers of all sorts of sweet treats.   The bill came out to about $450, but holy darnation was it worth it. Our after-dinner \"thanks for coming\" treat was a super sweet magnetic box with little muffins in it.",

Instead of asking what they could do for me, instead they informed me of what they couldn't. I was given more options of where I couldn't sit instead of where I could. In the end, we were seated at the table closest to the bathroom, with a great view of the desirable and EMPTY tables near the window overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Never asked how the food tasted either. Just a side note. I still tipped well despite the bad vibes. Anyway, lots of French food in Vegas- I'd recommend another restaurant. Try Twist or Eiffel Tower Restaurant  Received a boiler plate response. Totally meaningless. Much like my entire experience so it's no surprise.",

The menu is substantially similar to the menu when I first dined there more than 15 years ago (although the price has obviously changed). My favorites included the squab, foie, and venison.   Unfortunately, the experience has gone downhill over the years. Picasso used to be a fine dining restaurant where the dress code was enforced and men without jackets were offered jackets to wear during their meals. Now, management seems to feel that a track suit, sneaker and hats count as suitable attire. When I complained to the staff, I was told there was \"nothing they could do.\" How about: enforcing the dress code; offering a jacket; requiring the removal of hats; and/or not seating them/seating them somewhere other than the middle of the dining room? I will not be returning as these eyesores and the lack of response from the staff were not acceptable.",

However, a few hundred dollars later, we also left hungry. One of my plates was a bowl of some type of coconut milk with 1 grape and 1 tomatoe cut in half! I did appreciate the vegetarian menu options for all of my courses, as I could also eliminate and substitute certain parts of the course.  Although the food was presented very artistically, and we received a very cute Picasso box with 2 mini muffins as a gift after our meal, the food is not worth the price! For the same ambiance and HALF the price, you can go to Olives. However, we will always have the memory of coming curious and hungry and leaving engaged...and still hungry! Lol!",

    "text": "$$$$$$$, but it was definitely money well spent.   We opted to sit outside, which is a decision I regretted very much at first (now we don't get to appreciate their authentic Picassos while we have dinner!!) but quickly got over and became very glad about - having front row seats to the Bellagio musical fountains while you leisurely enjoy amazing food under the care of the most caring staff ever is an unparalleled experience.  I opted for the 5-course Menu Degustation which features mostly seafood selections, with the regular wine pairing which is mostly fruity and sweet selections. It was great for someone who doesn't like the taste of alcohol very much like myself, but if you're the kind of wine connoisseur who will live and die by your dry wines, perhaps you should inquire about the reserved pairing / other options.  Only complaint is that the food wasn't nearly as spectacular looking as I'd expect from what used to have 2 Michelin stars. They were definitely well presented, but gimmicks like flower petals / gold flakes / half burnt tree stumps as plates etc. popular at other Michelin star establishments are nowhere to be seen here.   P.S. The entire ordeal took a good 3.5 hours. The waiter was very kind to inquire if we had anywhere to be at after dinner from the get go, but even then I wouldn't plan to be anywhere with a time constraint afterwards. Sometimes I wonder if besides the price tag, time is also a major barrier to entry for fine dining. Sometimes people just can't afford to sit around long enough to watch the fountains go off a grand total of 9 times throughout dinner....",

    "text": "I went to Picasso with my parents specifically to try out their Seasonal Truffle menu. My parents had gone for drinks weeks before and knowing I am a huge truffle person thought it would be fun to go and try it.  Leading up to the night they let us know that it was dependent on the season and timing whether they would actually have truffles that night. They were supposed to call sometime before hand to confirm.  Oddly they never called, and we ended up confirming with them the day of a few hours before heading there. This may have been a warning sign we ignored.  The restaurant itself is wonderful. It has an unbelievable view of the Bellagio fountains and a great ambiance. Our waiter was excellent, as were the other attendants that night.  Unfortunately when I received my first truffle dish of the night I immediately noticed an overwhelming ammonia odor. I was taken aback and was actually certain it wasn't from cleaning chemicals because of just how strong it was, knowing they wouldn't serve a dish with visible cleaning liquids in it.  The actual flavor of the truffles was essentially non existent, probably because much of the flavor comes from it's normally pleasant distinctive aroma. For some reason I felt too embarrassed to actually say anything, even to my parents. I feared that if the chef hadn't noticed something like this that perhaps I was simply allergic to this type of truffle, or that I was sick. I proceeded to eat each truffle dish with what basically amounted to ammonia flakes on them.  The wine pairings were amazing. Truthfully it was some of the best wine I have ever had. The desert was also exceptional, and again the staff was top notch.  Once I arrived home I did some research on fresh truffle and discovered that this was almost certainly a case of bad truffles that should not have been served to us. I feel sad and embarrassed about my experience, but also know that the chef should have known what he was serving to guests, and that this is unacceptable for a place like this.",

The service, food, and ambiance are incomparable and allow you to feel as if you're in Las Vegas from a distance (so you don't have to cringe at the disgustingly drunk party-goers walking on the strip).  If you sit on the patio, you get front row seats to the synchronized fountain shows, which is actually a lot more magical than I originally thought it'd be. It's really something special.   The food was great - it was the first time I actually liked foie gras, as the course on the Degustation Menu was to die for. Everything, from start to finish, felt delicate and thoughtful and I couldn't imagine dining my first night in Vegas anywhere else.",

Picasso is the type of place that has no prices on the menu. $150 for a three course meal with three different main course options, including a $150 steak ($300 total). However the waiter did not even ask me if I wanted the third option and when I told him I did, he leaned in and asked if I could afford the extra $150! I was in utter shock. Not only was I dressed very nice (not some tourist in shorts and flip flops), but this is Vegas, you never know who has what kind of money. I should have left right there but the view was amazing. The rest of the night the staff bent over backwards for a table full of foreigners who they assumed would be a bigger tipper than me. It was a shame, the food was good, the view was great but the service sucked. I probably won't be returning.",

You have a fabulous view of the fountains  From the prix fixe menu, we got: creme of butternut squash, warm quail salad, foie gras, sauteed bass and lobster.  Every single item was cooked to perfection, delicious and plated so beautifully - like a Picasso painting.  Perfection in every bite!   Now, I must say this.  The items on the menu come in small portions so, if you're that hungry and you don't like waiting a long time for each course to be served - this is not the place for you.

    "text": "Ahhh yes, you get the service and food from this Michellin 2-star rated restaurant. Fancy..yes, service...yes, Picasso art...yes, water fountain show...a bonus.  Reservation is a must, but on our visit, there were several open tables still available. There are other Michelin star rated restaurants in Vegas, but this one gives you the opportunity to look at some fine art with one of them valued at $160 million. And you get a free show too...the water fountain at the Bellagio is right outside.  They also filmed parts of Ocean 11 here too, so it does look familiar if you've seen the movie. And although this is fine dining, you don't get the pretentious feeling like some restaurants in Paris. The servers were pretty cool, especially they deal with Vegas tourists on a daily basis. They ask you if you are seeing a show after dinner to help gauge with the timeliness of serving your meal. Very well knowledged staff that were pretty much standing by to help you throughout the night.  And now to the main event...  I went with the Menu D'egustation menu. The same for couple of friends of mine and the rest did the Prix Fixe menu. But either way, you get 4 or 5 courses. And you can pair it with their wine choice throughout the night. But we opted for a couple of red bottles since the majority of us chose the lamb as our main dish. They literally have thousands...yes literally thousands of wine to chose from...ranging from \"$30 to limitless.\" Yes those were the exact words from the maitre d'. So yah...we went with a couple of 100 dollar bottles instead...the Ruffino 2003 chianti and the Faust 2007 cab. Both were very nice that complimented everything throughout the night.  For a quick starter, they served a potato leek soup with a skewer of quail egg, salmon and caviar. Great starter. Just drink the soup straight up and the skewer was nice and cold and very fresh.  The first course from the d'egustation menu was the Maine Lobster salad. Nice, cold, fresh with avocado and with a little tanginess from the apple champagne vinaigrette. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=ZsCBs6ZyIx0c-hFK1OpRfw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_B...</a>  Next was the pan seared U-10 day scallop. Yes...scallop...singular, but it was divine. Fatty goodiness melting in your mouth, with a potato puree  and a small amount of jus de veau (broth). So small, yet it will take you a half an hour to finish it because you will just want to savor it again and again. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=HC4f8kFjLVsaWpKzdR8g1A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_B...</a>  For the next dish, I substituted the Foie Gras and went with their sauteed ruby red shrimp. Three pieces of shrimp that came with zucchini, artichoke, tomato and a pepper vinaigrette. Again, only three pieces of shrimp but the quality was superb. Small, but somehow it was just the right amount. The presentation was very nice. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=SFq-KEMsNJxloUEuJzJRTQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_B...</a>  For the main entree, I chose the roasted Tournedo loin of Colorado Lamb. The alternative is the sauteed filet of halibut. My lamb was cooked medium rare, very juicy, tender. It will make you go WOW. So again, savor this for awhile so your WOW can last longer. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=19MjcpPDcwLUVWrtGseWAw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_B...</a>  For the finale, I went with the berry buttermilk cake. It's a panna cotta, with raspberry syrah soup with strawberry ice cream. Very yummy with the hint of syrah wine that gives it a little kick. Great way to finish the meal. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g?select=LUOd5bR1tAh1qqGsUDJ1fw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0q_B...</a>  This place has it all. 5 star service, 2 Michelin stars. Several original Picasso's throughout the restaurant. Absolutely, I will come again. Just save up at least $200 or more, or win it at the craps tables.",

    "text": "The decor of the restaurant is based on Pablo Picasso's artwork. When you enter the main dining room you are greeting by a table that is entirely covered in a huge floral arrangement - different sizes and shapes of glass vases hold one type of flower each for a stunning rainbow effect. This is one of the best uses of floral arrangements I have ever seen. The restaurant sits facing the fountains of the Bellagio, so every half hour you are treated to an amazing view of the water show through the windows.  The food is elegant and artfully prepared - just what you would expect from fine dining at the Bellagio.  We ordered the Degustation Menu - five courses plus an amuse bouche, petite fours, and gift for the ladies. We also choose to participate in the suggested wine pairing - which was well thought out.  The sommelier did a lovely job of presenting and explaining his choices.   The Amuse Bouche consisted of a creamy red bell pepper soup and a cheese croquette. Simple, satisfying, and delicious.  The first course was a lobster salad with apple-champagne vinaigrette that was fresh and sweet and light.  Next was a perfectly seared day boat scallop on a smooth potato puree with a thick and rich veal demi glace.  My favorite course: sauteed Foie Gras with pound cake, almonds, and Riesling peach coulis.  The sweetness of the peaches and Riesling paired perfectly with the melt-in-your-mouth fattiness of the Foie Gras.  Paired with a glass of Tokaji, this was absolute perfection.  Main course: Roasted loin of lamb with pisto (a mixed vegetable side similar to ratatouille), mint aoili, and fried zucchini blossom.  I am not usually a dessert person, but this rocked my socks off: a \"beggar's purse\" made of phyllo dough filled with chocolate chip risotto pudding, served with a coconut macaroon and banana-passion fruit caramel sorbet. This was dessert perfection for me.  My husband ordered chocolate truffle beignets with peanut butter ice cream. I couldn't even tell you if he ate it or not, I was so absorbed in my chocolaty banana perfection.  The petite fours were good, but the ladies' gift - cinnamon elephant ear cookies - were amazing.",

    "text": "This is truly exceptional food in Las Vegas. The outdoor seating really transformed my entire impression of Vegas, which back on the strip was loud and full of colorful personalities. You know that \"ahhh.....made a gazillion bucks and reflect at the fountains\" moment that Ocean's 11 shows? Yeah. You can totally ride that vibe by sitting outdoors at Picasso.  We made reservations well in advance for a party of 4, and requested fountain view. They don't really differentiate between outdoor and indoor for that, so make sure you are clear. I asked for an outdoor switch and they were so accommodating. The difference is that outside the tables are spaced out a lot more, you can hear the Bellagio Fountain music, and see the water really closely. Indoors is a whole different vibe--it's a full house, you can see the other patrons around you....but here, on the patio, we were in our own little world. Celebrating our meager $100 dolla winnings that felt like megamillions. Unfortunately, if there is any wind, some of the fountain show variations moves the spray over to the tables. (We only had 1 uh oh moment when we saw all the sprinkles traveling in a giant wave towards us. Yummy.)  Bread was delicious. They put something magical in that French bread. The butter has a Picasso etch, which was lovely. I asked for a non-alcoholic fruit drink, and they brought out a cocktail glass, and freshly shook a glass of a grapefruit concoction--oh my god, I wish I had a pint of that ($7 per glass).   -Amuse bouche was very yummy, and set the meal well. -Favorite out of the starter was the fish....which was totally, hands down, 5 star worthy. Pea soup was also very delectable, as was the oysters+caviar. -Second: not a fan of foie gras, but I really enjoyed it off my friend's plate. The shrimp was also very tasty.  -Main: Deer was surprisingly good, and everything was well balanced. It didn't taste very gamey at all. Everything else was well done, but not that memorable in my mind to get 5 stars. My fish was also really well executed. -Dessert: underwhelming. I ordered the pear dessert, and the figs in the vanilla were a bit too chewy in my teeth--smaller chunks, please. The chocolate cake was decent, but nothing that spectacular. The passionfruit chocolate and rum ice cream was also good, but I have had better.  Overall, the service is impeccable (not intimidating at all), view is astounding outdoors, food is very well executed but not with many standout dishes. Dessert seems weak relative to the quality of the rest of the dishes. It's a wonderful, wonderful restaurant that deserves a visit if you are in Vegas, but don't expect it to be a best of your lifetime dining experience.  **Note: for show goers, we arrived at 5:30 and caught our 7:30 show with 5 minutes to spare. Did the regular prix fixe and didn't rush them ever.",

    "text": "A 5 star dining experience in every respect.  I was greeted at the podium by two lovely ladies who both expressed a hearty \"welcome back\" to me.  I was shown to my table which was one row in from the windows overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The table was waiting for me.  There was just one chair and one place setting waiting.    My server was Blake.  He had a great sense of humor, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion (later at dessert time), and he was there without hovering.  I noticed him approaching out of the corner of my eye when I was taking a photo and he just detoured to the next table.  When I was done, he came back.  He said I wouldn't want his hand in my photo.  I got the degustation menu.  There was an amuse-bouche--a small tea cup with some red bell pepper soup and a pheasant croquette.  The soup was very tasty and the croquette was equally tasty.  A nice way to start.  Bread service is not the usual basket on the table.  A bus person comes around and gives you two types of bread.  This is one area that could use a little upgrading, but best not to fill up on bread so I give Picasso a pass on this point.  First course--lobster salad.  I enjoyed the taste of the \"salad\" and the plating was whimsically done.  This is really not a salad, but a dish with a mound of lobster and some micro greens, pear tomato halves, some tiny melon balls, and some whole pink peppercorns which was a delight to chew along with the salad.  Second course--One scallop on a mound of potato mousseline with a ring of veal jus.  There was one very thin, lightly fried potato slice that was bent and sticking up like a little covering for the scallop.  Excellent presentation.  The scallop was perfect!  Third course--Foie gras.  A superb piece of foie gras with some almond slices, roasted pistachio pieces (ground) and a small brioche with rhubarb filling.  The plating had one line of tangerine sauce connection the foie gras with the brioche.  Fourth course--I chose the Colorado rack of lamb.  It's not really a rack of lamb but rather was a think lamb medallion that I asked to be done rare and it was exactly the way it should be.  Again, the plating was impeccably done.  Dessert--What to get?  The dessert menu had 6 choices.  When Blake came by and I asked his advice, he pointed to two choices, both of which were at the top of my list.  He tipped the scale in favor of the chocolate truffle beignets.  Imagine three small round beignets filled with warm chocolate truffle, accompanied by peanut butter ice cream.  The ice cream was atop a small tart of rich creme that had some large pearl tapioca in it.  There was a small piece of crackled peanut butter by the tart.  This was an absolute fine ending to a wonderful meal.  Again I have to mention the plating.  This is what makes a dining experience like this memorable.  After dessert, you're given a small tray with 7 truffles.  Obviously this would be for two people.  Since I was by myself, I made the sacrifice and ate them all.  One was a miniature lemon meringue tart!  Heaven!  About the service.  There was one bus person and one waiter assigned to the tables in my area.  The bus person was always there refilling my iced tea, taking plates away, asking if I wanted more bread, always aware of the needs of each table.  When I was fidgeting with my camera bag when I first sat down, he came over and hooked it on one of those table hooks I think originally made to hold a woman's purse.    A final note--during the meal a woman came by and greeted me and she said \"welcome back\" too.  Later I asked Blake if this was a common way of greeting guests as it was my first time at Picasso.  He said the computer had me listed as a repeat guest.    On leaving, you're given a small box with 3 palmiers.  The box has the ubiquitous Picasso on it.  Dessert for tonight.  This truly was a special dining experience!  I have added a few photos, but I tried not to duplicate the ones already posted.",

They sat us near the fountain knowing it was a special night for us.   When I told our waiter that I was an art enthusiast and loved Picasso, he encouraged me to walk around to view the many real works of the artist that are displayed around the restaurant. They are a must see for any art fan-- I was blown away by the rarity and variety of works they have.   We opted for the De Gustation menu which was a great choice. We had a six course dinner, with my main dish being halibut and my husbands, lamb.  Everything from the first bite to the last was visually stunning and delicious. The scallops were so melt in your mouth delicious-- I could eat them every day for the rest of my life and never tire of them. The chef wrote Congratulations on our dessert plates and gave us additional truffles and cookies as a thank you for having our wedding dinner there.   The wine selection was mind blowing. They also have an extensive whiskey and scotch collection which pleased my husband very much.   The icing on this cake was that they converted the flowers my husband had delivered to our table into my wedding bouquet at my request, completely unprepared and never doing that for a customer before. When I tell you they go above and beyond-- I mean it.   This is the most luxurious and elaborate place I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. The bill was over $500, but the experience is one I will live with forever and I will most definitely be back again for our anniversary.  100% worth it.",

The black bass filet (in saffron) was accompanied by a *wonderful* light, creamy cauliflower mousseline.  The medallions of fallow deer were a very tender, very smooth highlight.  This was one of the top ten restaurants I've enjoyed, in particular a very refreshing change from somewhat uneven places like Melisse.",

I would highly recommend sitting outside to watch the famous Bellagio fountains as this truly added to the overall ambiance of the dinner.  Our waiter Robert was exceptional and he had been with the restaurant since its grand opening in 1998.  I would recommend this for business or pleasure and we are glad that this was our first nights dinner here in Vegas.",

    "text": "where to start....   Decor: they have a great collection of Picasso painting and if you into arts it a treat. you get to be up close and personally to enjoy the painting. the ambiance is classy, open and very romantic.   service: from the minute you walk in they make sure everything is to your liking and everything that you ask them to do when you make your reservation. Our Server is very knowledgeable about wine and help us make a great selection for wine (Riesling -Schloss Schonborn 06) its one of the best Riesling i ever tasted. Normally for a young Asian dude come to a place like this they kinda looking on your and try to serve you, but here its a different story everybody is a VIP and they are there to serve you.   Seating: I recommend sitting next to the Bellagio Fountain so you will see the water show without interference. Our dinner start from 6:30pm and lasted about 2hrs. I was hoping to go enjoy dinner and watch the sun set and as the night turn darker and the water fountain show come on it the most romantic place you can be.  Food: We both go with the Prix entry (right side of the Menu) The oyster is awesome it the best oyster i taste in any restaurant up until now. Next i have the sea bass it was just right and cook to perfection. the right amount of Salted and sauce make it an enticing appetizer. for my main entry i have the Kobe beef ($125 extra) money well spent. it's medium rare and it was they best meat i ever ate. if you never have Kobe, you need to try it. It's the most tender and pamper meat there is, every bites is like butter in your mouth. mang.... I want to eat it again now. hahahaha  Also, the Deer is delicious too.... I know what you thinking deer? at a place like this! but they have it and sooooooooo goood.   Desert: The Sorbet... it is the best out of all the desert they have on the menu.   Overall: this place is gonna cost you (guys) so be prepare to dig deep in your pocket. I won $1500 so this dinner is free to me, but our bills come out to just under $600, this because we also buy a bottle of wine from them. so it's a great place to enjoy Vegas with the view of the fountain @ Bellagio and you get to be King or Queen for 2 hrs. hahahaha",

It IS business casual dress & the service is very very good. The Sommelier here really knows his wines and was not only helpful but enlightened us about some wine regions. We ordered the tasting menu & allow me to say that the Lobster Salad was outstanding. Perfect in every way. Of course I am a big fan of Julian Serrano & love his food.  I first had his cuisine at Masa;'s in San Francisco and I was hooked instantly! The menu here at Picasso offers fish as well as Steak, Lamb etc....The Halibut with Asparagas was outstanding and the Hollandaise sauce was the best I have ever tasted & perfectly balanced. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the portion was the right size. My husband had the \"A\" Steak and he said it was outstanding. This experience lasted well over 2 hours and it was totally enjoyable. Prices are high but in Vegas it is what you expect to pay at a restaurant of this caliber, meaning a Michelin Star restaurant. The service is good and the food is beautiful to look at. After all you begin to eat with your eyes !!",

The scallops were well prepared and nothing else was anything to write home about. Service was good, not fantastic.

There are beautiful, colorful, fragrant flowers everywhere. The place smells heavenly with the combination of all these flowers. In combination with these are the artworks adorning the place - painting, drawings and sculptures of, of course, Picasso. Then you add the wonderful view to the Bellagio fountains - wonderful!

It was a bit chilly so they offered me a shawl! How sweet was that!  Everything was just outstanding! The food, the service, even the plates were a peace of art. We were a group of 5 people and we spent about 2 hours there. We kept getting complimentary goodies from the chef which was very nice. Both my husband's and my desert plate had \"Congratulations\" written with chocolate. But that was not all! When we were leaving they gave each of us a cute little box with brownies in it. In addition I received a personal email from the manager the next day thanking us for coming over. I have been to Las Vegas many times and I wish I knew about this place earlier. Next time it will be the first on my list to visit.  They made my wedding celebration an unforgettable experience. All my guests told me that it was the best evening they've had.

Wait personal were welcoming with a quiet confident demeanor. This is some thing I really like. Usually this means that staff were well trained and can handle whatever is thrown at them. This deteriorate quickly however. The place got busy quickly and the quiet confident disappeared quickly together with the service.   I noticed that the staff were busy setting up half of this very romantic quiet restaurant into something that looks like a party room, or party area with out any solid partition. I ask our server after and he confirmed my fear that a corporate cocktail party will be using half of this room. So as you can imagine a corporate cocktail party in the middle of a romantic restaurant !!, how quiet, romantic can it be. I felt very sorry for a newly wed couple dinning that night, She even had her gown and veil on.    The hostess was excellent, helpful and welcoming, server with a french accent has all the attribute of a great waiter. But the quality of the rest of the staff seems to take a big step down.  Food servers or runners literally just dropped the food off, ( no food cover, no food cart) and mutter the food description and ran off.  The food is ok, nothing exceptional. So it is just the location, ambient and service. But what ambient with a cocktail in the middle of the dinning room, what service?   I worked hard for my money, and gladly pay whatever it took to have a great meal  that is a great experience. This is not it.  This cannot be a two or even a one Michelin star restaurant. I just changed my rating from a three star to two star",

Not that I've been to a lot, but I've been to the French Laundry, Michael Mina, and now Picasso.   For overall experience, both ambiance and culinary, I think the Picasso is my top pick.  Let's be clear here too, all three of the aforementioned venues are a drastic cut above the hundreds of other random other places I've been.    The food at the Picasso is only slightly less Earth shattering than the French Laundry - and at a considerably more palatable price.  Each bite is an experience worth remembering, and the fogra was even better than FL; seared to an amazing perfection.          The service was exactly what you would expect from a Michelin rated venue.  Calling the staff knowledgeable and attentive would be a disservice.  The servers are a necessary component of the experience.    Here's where Picasso stands out.  The ambiance, especially on the outdoor balcony, is breath taking.  I mean truly.  There you are, dressed to perfection (as much as possible), eating the most delicious food your mouth has enjoyed, and sitting behind the Bellagio fountains in that dry desert air; Frank Sinatra playing in the background, and surrounded by over $100 million in beautiful art.   It's impossible to describe but I promise you all, it's one of - if not the most- enjoyable experience I've had.    Save your money, and treat yourself to a life encounter that you (and I) don't deserve  :)",

The dining room is decorated tastefully with the focus on the wall of glass doors on to a terrace that is right next to the Bellagio fountains and also the impressive Picasso pieces featured all around the restaurant.  I had a glorious white chocolate martini. The prix fixe menu was perfect because I could choose from a couple of options for my courses. The chef sent over a little concoction in addition to what we had ordered. Everything we ate was absolutely savory and fantastic. With every bite I just wanted to close my eyes and just enjoy it. Between myself and my husband, we ordered a variety of the options and had ourselves a bit of a tasting. I can honestly say with all confidence that there is nothing the chef could put out that wouldn't have been exceptional. Every bite was just perfect.  I asked the waiter to choose a wine for me to go with my entree and he did an impeccable job. As a matter of fact, the entire service was perfectly timed, a nice balance of attentiveness but not hovering, friendly but professional. Just absolute perfection. Of all the fine dining establishments this is one of the handful that I can honestly say has zero room for improvement. Absolute PERFECTION in service.   The desserts... Oh. My. Just life changingly good. And they sent us home with a sweet little box with a couple of muffins for later on. Just fantastic.  You will PAY for what you experience here. Our bill with gratuity exceeded $500 for the two of us. That included a generous but well-deserved 25% tip. Yes, this is a LOT of money for most of us but I can honestly say it was worth every penny. If you want a perfect fine dining experience, you will pay for it. That's just reality. I highly recommend splurging and getting this experience.",

Every course was great, but nothing really stood out to me.  The ambience is excellent and on a day where it's not so hot (I went in April) sitting outside by the fountains is an AMAZING experience. It does get a rather noisy while the water show is going on, but you get front row seats and a great view.  Would I go back again? Absolutely. But there's a lot of other places I'd like to try first.",

    "text": "I took my wife here for our anniversary dinner.  You must understand that this place is expensive not just because of the food but also because you are paying for the experience and ambiance as a whole.  The paintings are amazing and you must walk around to look at them.  There were people in the restaurant that had no clue that these were actual Picasso painting and were wondering why we were admiring them.  The scenery and the views in this place are truly amazing.  I originally wanted to sit outside I made reservations for 630 but it was just way to hot so we asked to be seated inside because if you are able to sit outside and watch the water show that is so awesome.  Now onto the review of the food.  Me and my wife chose the prefix menus instead of the degustion I was a little annoyed that you have to pay an additional 150 dollars for the filet mignon on the five course tasting menu.  Now based on what I ordered I would give this place 3 stars only but because I was able to taste my wife's choices and those were fabulous.  I will start if with what I had first meal was the quail salad in my opinion that quail was cooked perfectly but was missing seasoning such as salt and pepper and left me wanting more as I at the meal.  My wife had the poached oysters with caviar I tasted one needless to say that was just amazing.  Next I had the fois gras.  I want to state that I was looking for forward to this all week I love fois gras and being from New York I have went to some French restaurants and it is a must for me to order.  The presentation of the 2nd course was beautiful but the fois gras was just ok it was lacking once again that needed flavor I was used to instead I feel the meal relied heavily on the jellies and berries accompanying the fois gras.  My wife got the shrimp which was amazing after tasting a piece.  Next we have the main entrees I selected the veal and my wife selected the main lobster now i was annoyed once more because the lobster had an extra 30 dollars added to the pre fix price but that is just a pet peeve of mine.  The veal for me was the redeeming part of the meal on my end.  It was cooked perfectly and the accompanied vegetables were paired very well along with the gravy.  My wife's lobster meal was just pure perfection also.  Lastly came the dessert my wife chose the strawberry cheesecake and I chose the chocolate lava cake.  I had told them earlier when I made the reservations that it was our anniversary and they made a wonderful arrangement for us.  Now I saw in some reviews that they also brought out little sweets for the guests we did not receive those and wish we did get some.  At the end I settled the bill and when we walked out they gave us two small boxes with two pieces of cake in each of them.  Overall a very nice experience with wonderful customer service and amazing ambiance.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place but it was disappointing at best. My boyfriend and I were SO EXCITED to try Picasso out and actually went to Las Vegas for this restaurant. It was solely a food trip. With such amazing reviews we expected the food to dazzle us.  Let's start with the atmosphere. The restaurant is really nice and the interior is pretty. There's paintings hanging here and there. We arrived right on time, but we did have to wait a little bit for our tables.   We both decided to go with the tasting menu. My boyfriend chose lamb for the entree and I chose the fish dish. My boyfriend also had wine pairing along with the tasting menu. I sipped a little bit of each of the wine.   Now as for the food and wine-nothing stood out. And I really mean NOTHING. Every single dish was mediocre. I've been to Providence, Benu, Keiko, N/Naka before and for each experience I always had at least a few dishes that I LOVED. Lobster salad was bland and didn't taste like much. Foie gras was my favorite dish out of what was served that day, but it wasn't mind blowing either. Both the lamb and fish dish was pretty bad. The lamb was so chewy and my fish was not seasoned enough. The fish itself honestly just tasted like grilled fish and the potato and broccoli that was served with it tasted like boiled vegetables. Honestly, I could have just bought made these at home myself. Dessert was not bad, but too sweet for my taste. That's just personal preference though, so if you like very sweet desserts, you will enjoy the dessert here.   As for the wine pairing, both my boyfriend and I didn't really like how the wines were paired. I felt like the pairing with the scallop dish disturbed/clashed with the flavor of the scallops. But again, that may be personal preference as well. I tend to just prefer fruity wines over earthier ones.   It's really difficult to hear what the sommelier is saying because he has a tiny voice and tends to murmur a little. I tried asking him twice for some of the wine pairing explanations, but just gave up in the end. I wish he would articulate better when he speaks. Sometimes if the sommelier really tells you how the wine is and how it goes well with the food the experience becomes much more enjoyable. This was definitely not the case here.   Our server on the other hand was very nice. And this is really the primary reason why I decided to give this place 2 stars instead of 1 star.   I don't know if I can blame the restaurant for this but there was a couple taking pictures of the paintings on the wall. And that's fine so long as you are not disturbing us but they decided to walk up to our table and the girl asked me to move so that she can take a picture of the painting. Come on. Please have some courtesy for other guests. It was so rude and that couple continued to go all around the restaurant with their camera to take pictures asking other people to move as well. I would think the staff could have asked them courteously to not disturb other guests during the experience.  IN SHORT- Overpriced for what they serve you. Go elsewhere if you want to have good food. There are plenty of choices in Las Vegas. I prefer Julian Serrano at Aria to this place. (Which is funny because Julian Serrano is the Executive Chef at Picasso).",

    "text": "One of the most pleasant dining experiences of my life.  As we arrived, we where greeted in a polite and formal manner. They took our coats and there was no wait to get to our seat.  Unfortunately we were seated at the far back of the dining room away from any windows, so our view was only of the other patrons. The dining room is very spacious however, so even in the back corner we did not feel like we where stick in the corner. This was much appreciated, as I get claustrophobic in small dining rooms full of people like at Le Cirque.  The service throughout the night was professional, informed, and always there when we needed. They even toped up my wine a few times in between courses without saying anything.  The one dish that stood out the most was a giant scallop dish. It was so good, that we where obsessed with scallops for months after, looking for anything that tasted near as good.  I will most certainly go back.",

    "text": "A very delightful meal.   The service was attentive, a bit cold perhaps, but perfectly proper, and the meal was timed just right. Four courses spread over two hours is the golden standard.   The food was as expected.  Now, to be fair, the amuse-bouche was a bit bland (we got a vichyssoise with a deep fried cheese stick) and the french baguette not the best.  But the rest of the meal was a symphony of perfect flavors. We both had the pea soup and I'd recommend that to anyone. It was light, minty, and airy, with a minute amount of pig belly fried to perfection.  A great opening to a great meal. Following recommendations from fellow Yelpers, I ordered the shrimp instead of foie gras, and my husband had the latter.  I ended up liking his foie gras more than my shrimp, even though the shrimp was very nice. I felt the liver was prepared perfectly - delicate and bright with perfect, slightly fruity accompaniments.    I then had the lobster and he had the veal chop. Both were absolutely stunning. The chop was perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious wine reduction sauce and flavorful mushrooms - my eyes quite literally watered when I had a taste: a perfectly European mixture of flavors and textures.  My lobster was probably among the best I've ever had. Now let's talk lobsters. More often than not, chefs go the easy route of serving properly cooked lobster with clarified butter and a variety of classic accompaniments. That's all good. Sometimes, though, chefs get adventurous and prepare their lobsters as dishes and that can become dangerous. With such a delicately flavored meat, lobster is difficult to balance and can easily get lost in other flavors. Not here. My lobster was lobster first, and perfectly textured at that. It was presented in a light corn sauce which flawlessly accented the main ingredient.  At Picasso you never see the lobster shell - they serve the whole lobster, including the claws, already de-shelled.  I was very happy with my choice.   Onto desserts. I had the poached pear and he had the fondant. Skip the fondant, it was nothing special.  The pear tart was nice and crispy.  Too bad they go for fondant and not a fluffier, lighter souffle, a beloved French classic.  Sadly, my husband declared the Picasso's staff doesn't know how to prepare a cappuccino.  The same goes for my tea.  It was beautifully served, but also not good - the tea bag designed for a big teapot was placed in a personal pot and that resulted in a bitter, dark cup fill of unnecessary tannins.  On the way out we received two boxes with mini muffins.  The muffins were not very god.  Chocolate pralines would have been a better choice, ore better yet - nothing.  I thought it might help some to know the prices. Prix-Fixe menu was $118 and Menu Degustation $128.  No other options were available.  Desserts were included.  Hot beverages were priced fairly.  Having had dined at other fine dining establishments I didn't find these prices particularly out of line.",

Not to say the dishes weren't worth every penny. I got the pris fix course.  Everything was great. Really fancy. My date was really impressed. Until the foie gras came out. It was so under cooked that I felt like I was biting into my butt cheek. I've never done that but I can imagine what it would feel like. I gagged and spit it out. The view of the fountain was spectacular. I dressed in a dinner suit but felt way overdressed. Lots of casually dressed tourists. A shame considering how fancy the place is.  I really had a good time. It felt like a special occasion just being there. Oh, and we got a fancy box with the receipt.  I'm not sure how many people would enjoy this kind of experience but I did. It's a winner for me.",

All that and just give me a bag of beef jerky and beer. One important note: the menu is a tasting menu. You pick one of two lists, either a chef's prepared selection (left side) or one each of 3-4 options under each heading (right side: app, salad, main course, dessert, etc). Either way it's like $120.   I did the chef's tasting, and there were no disappointments at all. I will say that the portions were on the small side. If you have a hearty appetite you could use a sack of fries of afterwards. But again, this place is probably operating some hefty margins. The ingredients are top level, but the price is, well, in a league of its own. Amongst the pantheon of high quality Vegas eateries I would not spend my own money here. Just not enough bang for the buck.",

Didn't care much for the slithers of almonds for the crunchy texture.  Rhubarb sauce was a good acidic sour note to balance the fatty richness of the tender juicy foie gras. U-10 Dayboat scallops: potato mousseline, gravy.  Yummy. Lamb loin: cooked perfectly.  Less gamey than the usual lamb flavors.  Good or bad depending on what you like.  I don't mind either way.  I guess when it was less gamey, you forget for second it is lamb.  Great service and ambiance.  Wine guy was very enthusiastic and excited about the wines he presented.  I learned a lot from him.

I'm giving 4 stars & not 5 because there was another diner who was allowed in wearing jeans, tee, track jacket and a baseball cap.

The lamb was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor.  Even the cooked tomato and fried thyme stem was delightful.  The gave us a free starter with smoked salmon, caviar and quail egg on a skewer with a cream of potato soup that was awesome.  Everyone in my party loved the desserts and were priced around $9 but the work they put into these dessets was impressive.  These desserts were very complex but made to enjoy.  I like to disect my meals and everything was difficult to manufacture but the results were awesome. The paired wines were excellent and they served nice Italian and Spanish wines.  The meal cost $1000 with tip for four but I don't mind paying that much as it was worth every penny.",

My husband ordered the Black Truffle Menu and I had the Vegetarian Menu. The service was good, the first couple of courses were great, however when the main courses arrived, we were very disappointed. My husband's filet was under-seasoned and didn't have a crusty sear and the plating was extremely unappealing. My plate of steamed veggies was under-seasoned and boring. We noticed as we were sort of pushing our dinner around our plates, we were being ignored by our waiter for about 30 minutes. Neither one of us finished our dinner. For $450, for two people, WITHOUT ALCOHOL, we were hoping for a much better experience and while we don't regret trying it out, we do wish we had complained IN PERSON, but we had to get to the show. We expected a lot more out of such a well-reviewed restaurant. Maybe they just turn it on for the critics.",

Of course, I am sure the menus will change depending on the season and availability of the food.

Veal from the tasting menu - best veal I had ever had. It was absolutely amazing. The sauce was complex, the texture of the veal was perfect and the taste was sophisticated which is not a word I would usually describe veal.  I can't believe other reviewers are complaining about the \"tiny portions\"...hum...that's what a tasting menu is!  We eat out at expensive fancy places all the time and honestly, I think this is one of the best. I love the fact that they ONLY have the tasting menus so that the chef can focus on perfecting these dishes each evening for his diners.  Whether you frequent fine-dining establishments or if you are up to try something new in Vegas, this is a good choice.  BTW, very romantic ambiance, overlooking the Bellagio's incredible fountain.",

    "text": "This rating is based on a dinner visit.  Atmosphere - 4:  Upscale, quiet, and very comfortable.  The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains.  There is also a nice patio area outside if you want a close up fountain encounter.   And of course, if you love Picasso there are numerous originals occupying the walls.  Menu - 4:  Two fixed menu options that offer optional wine pairings at an extra cost.  Not the place to go if you want a wide variety of food choices.  That said, the menu was very well thought out and offered excellent dishes.   Service - 4: Big time kudos to the sommelier, he knew his stuff way beyond my ability to even evaluate him...he is crazy good at his job.  He spent a great deal of time covering the wines with us, and his selections for the pairing option were over-the-top good.  He was the highlight of the service experience.  We received good service from the rest of the staff as well.  The main reason I didn't give Picasso 5 stars is because after our meals were finished it took a very long time to get the check, even after we asked for it.  Food - 5:  The meals were fantastic and worthy of their high acclaim.  The deserts were fun and creative.  Presentation was very good, but not overly exciting.  Perhaps we expected more presentation flair because, well it's all about Picasso right?  Wine List - 5:  The wine list was the size of my Dad's old law books (the bigger ones!), and just as heavy too!  Fantastic selection of old world wines.    Overall - 4:  Picasso is a Five Diamond, 2 Michelin Star restaurant with a reputation as one of the best dining spots in Las Vegas.  In my opinion, sometimes the highly rated, highly acclaimed places also generate highly elevated expectations.  Those expectations in turn can take a lot of the luster off the experience.   I think this was True in our case.  We expected a lot, and while our experience was very, very good, it just didn't quite deliver the bang-for-the-buck we were expecting.  Frankly, I also think there is just a little too much \"Vegas\" tarnishing an otherwise fantastic establishment.",

We decided to just wear our skimpy outfits to Picasso and save time by heading straight to the club afterwards..I just regret that we both didnt choose something a bit more classier, but it wasnt my choice in the first place to choose the color red which made us look so trampy..=(  Anyways, besides all of that we sat on the patio with the beautiful view of the watershow..It was all so romantic!! There were two prix fix dinner menu options to choose from and there was a great variety in each menu. Everything we ate had a bunch of different flavors that kept exploding in my mouth, and was simply so orgasmic (dont think nethang dirty now)..Everything was so elegantly prepared..Me and my friend just kept on raving about how excellent the service, ambiance, view and food was!..  I indeed intend to go back..You might have to dig a bit in your pocket though..An average dinner for two will cost around 300..I dont gamble when I go to Vegas because I'd rather bet on something that I know I wont lose on, so I'd rather just bet on myself, and boy was it a treat to do!",

I went there with a group of friends for my birthday and was completely impressed with the quality of food and their impeccable service.  The wait staff was so attentive without being invasive. If you go, be prepared to drop a pretty penny (for 8 of us we paid well over $100 per person). However, I can't stress enough that the food, the service, and (I forgot to previously mention) the view of the fountain show is well worth the price. We sat outside on the patio. My suggestion is to either sit inside if you don't want to get mist sprayed on you from the fountains. We didn't care; it was magical having a front row (albeit a little wet) seat.",

    "text": "How appropriate that the half-brilliant food at Picasso should so closely resemble the minor-league paintings, courtesy of the restaurant's namesake, that grace the walls of this mostly adequate fine-dining establishment located \"lakeside\" at the Bellagio Hotel.  You might think that I'd have felt cheated having been presented with such inauspicious works from an artist who's membership in \"The Pantheon\" is so rightfully secure.  You would be wrong, however, to make that assertion.  In my mind, even the least-interesting Picasso still veritably hums with the genius that has conferred upon him the status as a near-consensus choice as the single most important artist of the modern era.  And just as one must, in the course of appreciating the art, ignore the piggish chauvinism that the artist himself exhibited during his reign... one must likewise ignore the missteps that mar the canvas of Chef Julian Serrano's menu if one is to be receptive to the more vivid charms that are in evidence.  The space itself is quite lovely.  Rich and sumptuous, with dim lighting that is punctuated by spotlights shining down on both the tables and the million-dollar canvasses that line 3 of the surrounding walls.  The fourth wall opens up onto the aforementioned \"lake\" and its ever-present circus of projectile choreography.  As cheap a thrill as it is, I must confess an abiding fondness for this brand of contemporary Vegas kitsch.  You would do well to note that the fountains are freakin' LOUD, though... and if you are the skittish type you might ask for a table a little farther away from the sideshow.  Our meal commenced with an amuse of boiled quail egg and smoked salmon on a skewer served with a small cup of leek and potato soup garnished with slivered almonds.  The skewer was rich and silky, with the appropriate notes of salt and smoke, and the soup was earthy and luscious, the almonds providing good textural contrast.  My first course was a bowl of butternut squash soup, (a holdover from the fall/winter menu perhaps?)  Regardless, it was cloying and unremarkable.  It was helped, slightly, by the addition of some tasty bread and butter but on the whole it left me with that arched-eyebrow \"Oh Lord, here-we-go\" look of disappointment that I sometimes get.  Yes, sometimes.  REALLY, it's only SOMETIMES!!  Stop hitting me in the shoulder, dammit!  Second course found me sizing up a dish of langoustine tails with asparagus in a saffron broth.  Sounds delicious, right?  Well in this case everything clicked and I'm happy to report that delicious is exactly what it was.  A brilliant little piece of chamber music on a plate.  A richly satisfying meditation of harmony and balance and if I weren't such a neurotic snob I would have licked my plate clean.  In my shame I must confess that the best I could do was to sop up the remaining broth with more of that tasty bread.  For the main course I selected the veal chop and for the most part was happy I did.  The chop itself was delicate and toothsome.  My only complaint is that the pan jus upon which it rested was lifeless and ordinary.  Pan jus is one of those things that, when done properly, can elevate a simple dish toward unexpected heights.  Such an elixir should be part of every great chef's arsenal but on the night in question it's addition did little more than color the plate.  Pity.  My friends and I decided to supplement our menu with a plate of the night's special meat, an offering of Kobe beef, which we felt necessary to compliment the fine bordeaux and Rioja we had assembled.  When it was presented to the table, however, it was distressingly overdone.  Not even borderline, mind you, but just short of grey-all-the-way-through.  How it even made it out of the kitchen is a puzzle I am sure I will never decode.  To their faint credit, the offending dish was whisked away and replaced with a suitably-cooked replacement.  That said, the beef was only great, falling well short of the magnificence that it should have shown.  What a disappointing, yet somehow fitting metaphor for the overall experience.  One aspect I feel compelled to note is the incredibly gracious treatment shown to us by the Head Sommelier, Robert.  We brought our own wines and he really went the extra mile in creating a superb experience.  If only the restaurant as a whole had manifest such careful attentions I imagine I would have expected nothing less than the Young Ladies of Avignon to grace the walls.  As it was, the wine service was enough to catapult Picasso in my esteem to 4-star status.  And if you hit it really big at the tables, ask Robert to open one of the 1947 Cheval Blancs he has in the cellar.  Just be sure to let me know what time the reservation is.",

    "text": "An exceptional experience.  Ambiance can simply not be beat (surrounded by 50 + million dollars worth of Picasso originals, elegantly appointed space and a clear view of the Bellagio's famous fountain and light show).  You can choose from two menus- the Prix Fixe, which is three courses (I believe), for $105 per person. Or you can choose the 5 course tasting menu. Both FI and I chose the tasting menu and, after perusing the encyclopedia-sized wine list, decided to go with the wine pairing.   Since there are so many reviews, I'm just going to go over the hi lights:  1. Foie Gras and sauteed peaches paired with a deliciously sweet Hungarian wine to balance the richness of the FG.  I've usually had FG in something or as a spread. This was a generously portioned piece \"straight up.\" Presentation was outstanding.   2. Scallop on whipped potatoes with veal reduction. I would have thought that the veal reduction would have overpowered the scallop- not so. Scallop was perfectly caramelized and the potatoes melted in your mouth.  3. Dessert - vanilla bean crepes with cream cheese gelato. Presented as crepe \"purses\" ties with cocoa bean over raspberry puree with a chocolate hoop giving the dish a 3D look.   4. Sommelier and general service:  Sommelier personally explained each wine pairing, answered all questions and selected a diverse and balanced collection to accompany our dishes. Bravo!  Service was attentive and upscale without being intrusive or arrogant.   I will say that there was only one small issue that we had: There was a lot of lag time between the amuse bouche and our first course. Almost an hour. The waiter even brought us a book about the restaurant to pass the time. This was both odd and amusing. Once the courses started, however, all was well.",

    "text": "Dining at Picasso is an experience you will never forget.  At least I won't.  I can honestly say that the dinner I enjoyed at Picasso was the best I have had so far in my life, without question.    I dined at Picasso in October 2006.  I was at the Bellagio for a convention and decided to give it a try.  At that particular time the chef was featuring a five course Alba White Truffle Menu, in which every dish featured these little treasures.  The meal was $300 and I splurged and purchased the wine pairings for an extra $150.  It was well worth it.  It was so memorable that I saved the menu.  The first course was a warm potato Vichyssoise with steamed leeks and potato gnocchi, paired with a 2001 Franz Hirtzberger Pluris Grauburgunder Smaragd.  The second, and my favorite course, was a creamy arborio risotto with jus de veau, paired with a 2003 Jermann Vintage Tunina.  The risotto was just unbelievably creamy and pleasantly pungent.  The third course was butternut squash ravioli with a 2004 Yves Cuilleron, Les Chaillets.  This was my favorite wine of the evening.  The fourth course was a prime filet mignon with a 2001 Bodegas y Vinedos Alion.  Then, the dessert: caramel orange bread pudding with poached Bartlett pears, muscat syrup and pear sorbet, paired with a 2003 Vaickenburg Madonna Eiswein.  Soooooo good!  The ambiance was sophisticated and elegant; I particularly enjoyed admiring the original Picassos that adorn the walls.  The service was impeccable; I particuarly enjoyed our somellier and his vivid descriptions of each region where our wines came from.  I just can't think of a better combination of fantastic food, outstanding wine, and first-rate service.  As you would expect at the Bellagio, Picasso is not for the faint-of-wallet.  But it is worth every penny.",

There is no a la Carte menu, your options are limited to the degustation menu with pre-selected appetizers or pre-fixed dinner. We went with pre-fixed, the food was just good but not exceptional as you expect for Michelin star restaurant.

    "text": "While wandering around the Picasso exhibition at New York's MoMA the other day, I suddenly had a flashback.  It was one of those violent flashbacks... you know, the ones in vibrant technicolor that almost brings you to your knees.  Last time I experienced something like that, I woke up in some back-alley in Saigon covered in peanut oil and bean sprouts... but I digress. Anyway, I'm standing in the middle of this magnificent, world-class museum staring at Picasso's \"The Persistence of Memory\" and the only thing that's on my mind is \"where the hell can I get a wi-fi connection?\"  I rush home and sure enough, I've forgotten to pen down all the gory details of my dinner at Picasso, Las Vegas... shame on me.  _______________________________________________________  When preparing for our Vegas trip, wifey made sure to request a window-side table overlooking the gorgeous techno-fountain at the Bellagio.  After all, if you're gonna eat at this now iconic Vegas landmark, you'd better get an up-close and personal view of it.  The space is quite large and tastefully decorated.  It's elegant, but not stick-up-your-ass stuffy.  Make sure to wander around the restaurant in between courses to check out their Picasso collection.  Service was what you'd expect for a Michelin 2-star establishment... they did a nice job kissing my ass.  We went with the tasting menu for the evening and were not disappointed.  It was an orgasmo multi-course event for the ages.  After about 4 courses, my mind started to warp like those crazy Picasso images you always see.  The clocks began to twist and melt, a bouquet of roses exploded from wifey's chest, the sommelier's face twisted into an almost unrecognizable and amorphous mass of teeth and eyeballs.  If you can't tell yet, we had a lovely dinner. We even saw the Bellagio fountain show exactly 10-1/2 times during our meal!!  Best of all, I woke up next morning in the Nevada desert covered only in peanut butter and cucumber blossoms...",

    "text": "This is the best meal I've ever had.    We went in a party of 9 and took part in the 5 course tasting menu.  There were actually two sides to the menu, and each had a couple choices per course.  Wine pairings were offered for each course.  The selection allowed for each to choose what he really wanted to try out.  The Warm Quail Salad was spectacular.  Each item was perfectly crisp -- including two beautifully cooked drummettes.  A piece of lettuce was a revelation.  I never knew how special attention to every detail can be so important.  The Ragout of Seasonal Vegetables was lovely.  Again, perfectly cooked vegetables, great attention to each piece.  Did we forget to mention the foie gras?  My first experience with the stuff, and I enjoyed it highly.  For the meat course, I had lamb.  It was, again, very good, though possibly over cooked.  Indeed, other party members had overcooked fish during this course.  However, at this point I didn't care.  The au gratin may have been the cheesiest thing I've ever consumed.  It was too powerful!  (I asked the watier what was in there, and he mentioned some spanish cheese similar to manchego.)  Dessert.  Well, I was already stuffed, but we couldn't say no.  I had the chocolate lava cake with cassis ice cream.  Just... wow.  I did not take part in the wine pairing, but everyone else did, and they seemed to enjoy them very much.  Our waiter (who seemed to be our personal waiter even though we knew that not to be the case) could speak about the wines in great detail.   In fact, he could speak to each and every dish, as well.    The service overall was excellent.  You ordered once, and they did everything from there.  No questions asked.  If something came up, the waiter addressed only my friend who had made the reservation in a whisper so as not to distract the rest of us from our meal.   When courses were to be presented, several waiters showed up at the same time with all dishes, and they knew who got which dish without hassle.  It truly was professional, to the point of placing dishes on one side and removing from the other.  They run a tight ship.  It's impossible for me not to recommend Picasso.  There were some problems, yes, but the standard for the food was so high, and the service so excellent, that you owe it to yourself to go.  It was definitely worth it.",

We were promised not a peanut would be in one dish that we ordered. We were in love with our meal, after dessert they brought out a platter of pinafores - which in my opinion is never needed. We were delightfully full and the pinafores always tip you over the edge into \"stuffed\" category. Anyway - although there was supposedly no peanuts in the offending piece of cookie, there could be \"trace amounts\".   Needless to say my husbands system was wrecked for about 24 hours.
