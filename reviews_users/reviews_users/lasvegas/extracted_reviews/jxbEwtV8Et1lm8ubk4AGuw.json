Upon walking to the entrance, a piece of paper notified us that they do not have their liquor license and we can bring our own alcohol, if wanted.   We were greeted and seated almost right away, which was great.   I'm not sure if the lack of decor is because of budget but the walls are really bare & the color scheme does not match at all.   The menu looked and sounded very appetizing but I was slightly disappointed when I received my food. The biscuit was huge (no complaint there) but it was very dense. The gravy lacked flavor and the country fried steak was actually really good! Also, the Mango drink that had yogurt in it, was ok. I felt as if I stuck a straw in a tub of yogurt & started sipping.   Overall, I do not think I will be returning due to a misleading name and over priced mediocre food.",

Much better than any overpriced breakfast spot on the Strip like Mon Ami Gabi and there overpriced eggs Benedict or Hash House and Squeeze. They have better prices too.

    "text": "just now I have been an avid customer of Mimosas since I moved here in August 2018. Made an order via Uber Eats this time. My order was not only incorrect but when I called I was told that's an Uber Eats issue and to call Uber but I can't get my money refunded and then the representative hung up on me. I'm 4 months pregnant and my order was specific to my dietary needs. I told them this by the way. When I called back I told them, I don't want a refund. I just want my order corrected. I even told them that if there will be an additional charge that I have no problem paying the difference. The owner told me \"We don't have time to correct it or no send another Uber driver out because we're busy.\"   What I love about that response is they're never too busy to keep the benefit of my money although I can't eat my own meal. That's no excuse. So I drove down to Mimosas and demanded my order get corrected. They simply refired what was already cooked and hand my back my meal. To be honest, it looks like the food fed to pigs before slaughtered and the hasbrowns are cold; the staff near the kitchen had an attitude.    Sometimes your food can be good but if the treatment is bad its irrelevant. I definitely won't be back again! Vegas is too competitive especially in the food industry to tolerate sub par treatment.    I drove back home and made whatever breakfast I could in my pantry.",

I can strongly agree with the other Yelp reviews on here that this place did not disappoint. We were greeted by the nice hostess who seated us within minutes. Our waiter then came by immediately to introduce himself and took our drink order while we looked over the menu. Considering that it was our first time here, the menu was a bit overwhelming. There were so many choices of omelettes, benedicts, skillets, waffles, French toasts, pancakes, and other breakfast favorites you can imagine. My boyfriend decided on the corned beef skillet and I chose the fried chicken benedict. On the fried chicken benedict, you have the choice of either hollandaise or gravy. Since I wanted to try both, they were nice to offer both sauces and put them on the side. The food came out quick and hot. Everything was extremely delicious and flavorful. I really liked the gravy with the fried chicken benedict. We were also surprised that the portions are humongous! We both ended up getting to-go boxes because we were just so stuffed. In addition, our waiter was very nice and attentive with checking on us frequently and refilling our drinks.   Overall, this is a great brunch spot for good food and excellent service. Although this place is known for their mimosas, we didn't try it at this visit. It'll definitely give us a reason to come back. We we will be back for sure.",

First of all the service was amazing! We had so many people check on us and make sure we were taken care of and the food. ohhhhhh the food! They need to warn people that the portions you get are insane! It's so much food! We ordered the eggs Benedict, the chorizo scramble and the chicken bacon waffle! YES you read that right . Bacon inside the waffle topped with chicken! Such things should be forbidden! I ordered  and would have ordered   if my friends weren't so judgy lol I actually didn't even finish mine and had to get a box. The mimosa flavors are endless and I really enjoyed the prickly pear! At the very end they all came out and sang happy birthday to my friend while they put a sombrero on her head and gave her a birthday shot! Just an amazing place with amazing food and an amazing staff.",

The problem came when they brought our order out, one plate at a time...who does that?!   It took 15 minutes from the first plate of pancakes (which were a side replacement for my toast) until the last plate at our table, my egg white omelet.   Here's problems  2 & 3,  they delivered the wrong burger and my omelette was not egg whites only (which they charge an extra 1.25 for)   My husband ate his burger because he didn't want to wait for the correct one and I did the same with my omelette    The food was good overall, but 2 wrong orders on a table of 4 is unacceptable and serving them one at a time is silly.

Replacing a former restaurant and open now for just over a few weeks, Mimosas Gourmet offers diners a collection of their eponymous beverage in a wide range of shapes and sizes, the bill of fare itself quite sizable while the 2,500 square foot space features relatively typical seating options, the stero overhead playing IHeartRadio at a fairly loud volume, though not loud enough that conversation is impaired.  Sharing one $8.50 Guava Mimosa, a $3.99 Biscuit and a trio of the restaurant's more interesting plates, it was in piecemeal fashion as dishes were prepared that items were sent forth from the kitchen, the bubbly beverage far more bitter than those many in Sin City with sliced Strawberries and Oranges on top for a touch of visual flare.  Receiving the Churro Waffle and one mistaken plate first, the order re-confirmed and very obviously resubmitted to the kitchen given the delivery times to follow, the team could go a long way by promoting this item as a 'signature' with both the interior and top of the dough featuring a generous amount of Cinnamon and Sugar, the faux-Maple Syrup not a personal favorite but really not so bad when paired with a globe of Vanilla Ice Cream that slowly melts and melds the flavors.  Maroon 5 followed by Bruno Mars, the crowd a wide range of ages and ethnicities, it was after some delay that the Bacon-studded Waffle topped with crisp Chicken Fingers arrived with Honey already added, both items well prepared if not particularly memorable while the overpriced biscuit was fluffy and delicious despite being more like a jumbo dinner roll than something with proper buttery layers.  Serving large portions, the biggest and richest yet to come, it was another ten minutes before the three-piece tower of French Toast landed to the right of un-cleared plates and empty Water glasses, this diabolical concoction seeing melted Marshmallow Fluff and at least a tablespoon of Nutella at top, middle and bottom, the Cinnamon and Ginger not entirely lost either thought the center piece of toast was so overly saturated with toppings that it almost ate like Custard.     *** Not exactly \"locally owned,\" but nonetheless doing some interesting spins on Breakfast and Lunch classics in a space that is comfortable and easily accessible to those in Spring Valley or Summerlin, Mimosas Gourmet joins an ever-growing list of places to consider for breakfast when tired of the same ol' same ol' and for those unwilling to go looking for better in the Southeast or on the Strip.",

It's awesome outside they had a little coffee area that said enjoy complimentary coffee while you wait, that was a cute touch I have never seen before.  We were seated and drink order was taken right away. Then about 15 minutes later our food order was taken. There isn't anything for the kiddos to do while you wait so bring something to keep them entertained.  The food took awhile to cook but that's ok, however in a really busy day I can imagine it would be longer.  Food was amazing. Had the steak, avocado sandwich with caramelized onions and fries. Their fries are the best.   Kids meal portions are huge. Daughter had pancakes , with the eggs and bacon. Their pancakes are the bomb.  Husband had skirt steak and eggs and potatoes. Skirt steak was over cooked and a bit rough, toast is also over cooked but potatoes were amazing.  Service and people are nice, birthdays here are nice. The mimosas are mediocre. But will definitely be coming here again.",

I had the smoked salmon skilled for breakfast that was so tasty and filling, so it was already dinner time when I realized that I didn't have lunch today.   The owners come from San Jose, CA, where they have the same concept restaurant. They told me that the real specialties are the Mimosas. The Super Mimosa is poured in a 60 oz glass and contains a full bottle of Champagne, 10 oz of vodka and OJ. However, since they just opened doors in Las Vegas, they have to wait for Clark County to clear their liquor license in a couple of weeks.I'll be back soon to try on the Mimosas.",

The breakfast menu has a wide variety of choices. Our two selections were the short stack of pancakes (2 per order) with a side order of bacon and the Chili Verde with two eggs over easy and hash browns. The Chili Verde breakfast comes with three corn tortillas, refried beans, choice of eggs, choice of potatoes, and choice of toasted bread. The pancakes were very large and had a nice hint of vanilla. The bacon was over cooked, hard to cut and was returned to the kitchen. The pork in the Chili Verde was fork tender and tasty with the green salsa. The two eggs were perfectly cooked. I would have preferred a thicker sauce for the refried beans. Hash browns were nice and crispy but way too much for one person. I passed on the toast.   On this day we choose Mimosas Gourmet because it was convenient  to the places we were going. Since it is not in our neighborhood I would not drive the distance to specifically eat there.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give a higher rating, but this place simply isn't named Pancakes Gourmet.  Mimosas Gourmet is a brunch restaurant that's located clear across town from me. Although I normally wouldn't have to venture beyond Henderson for this type of food, I was meeting up with some friends and they seem to favor this side of town in general.  This spot is next door to La Maison de Maggie, which I'd tried last year, so I knew where I was going. In case you're not as familiar with this plaza on Durango between Spring Mountain and Desert Inn, look for Dunkin Donuts and Arby's and take one of the small side streets, preferably on the Arby's side.  The place was completely packed when I arrived, and fortunately our group was already seated. It did take a while to get to order, but they seemed to prep the food quickly enough once that happened. I won't knock them for any slowness.  However, I didn't really like two of the dishes which I'd tried. The star protein of the Fried Chicken Benedict ($13.50) was boring and dry, not the juicy meat with crispy batter which you'd expect. To add insult to injury, the biscuits (a twist, replacing the standard English muffin) weren't really rich or flaky. Using the Pepper Plant pepper sauce made it a little better, thanks to the savory spices and the moderate kick of heat, but it wasn't enough. The side of country potatoes was pretty enjoyable at least, but not quite addictive.  I also found little to write home about in the Bananas Foster French Toast ($11.95). The caramelized bananas were nice, but I think the heaps of whipped cream weren't enough to cover up boring, overly chewy French toast that was rather bland other than the cinnamon flavor.  What I'd possibly drive back for are the pancakes. Despite my massive food coma afterward, I don't regret going for the carbs. I ordered the Banana Walnut Pancakes ($9.50), which were fluffy and buttery and held up even as leftovers a few hours later. The banana was incorporated into the batter, and the crunchy walnuts were the perfect complement in flavor and texture. You almost don't need the syrup with these pancakes. And lest you think I'm cutting back, I had to get a to-go box because those pancakes are quite literally as big as my head.  Expect huge portions at Mimosas Gourmet, but stick to the pancakes and perhaps look into some of the foods which I didn't try. I'd avoid the French Toast menu, but maybe I was simply unlucky enough to run into the lone dud of the Eggs Benedict selections.",

    "text": "Needed a breakfast spot and all the usuals that came to mind are always super crowded. So I used yelp and found this place.   When you drive up you think...meh...it's in a strip mall...a French crepe place next door almost had me derail to croissants but I stayed on task.   We walked in and there were plenty of seats and he instantly gave us a nice booth. The menu is filled with a lot of scrumptious looking items and it definitely had a southwest flare to it. And let's not Forget to mention there were a lot of alcoholic beverages to choose from. They have a full bar. The mimosas look to be mixed with wine not champagne. I'll have to try it on The next visit.   Happy to see chilaquiles on the menu I'll try that next time. I ordered a Mexican skillet and my daughter ordered an omelette and added steak. We ordered a chocolate chip pancake to share.   Omg the food was sooo good. The steak in the Mexican skillet with the mushrooms...yummy. The chocolate chip pancake was so good and it Had that crunchy crust on the bottom! My daughter said hers was good but I think she liked my steak better they must have used a different meat and they didn't put much in it. We did have to pick apart her omlette and search to see if it was just a mistake. But we found a couple of pieces. So I wouldn't recommend the add on steam unless you're specific about the steak etc.   The waiter was concerned we didn't like the food because we had quite A bit left and we didn't want a doggy bag. Well the portions are huge and we don't typically take breakfast stuff home. But I loved the concern.   Delicious! I recommend it!",

It was definitely too early for customers but heyyy Im here!  I was greeted and sat wherever since I had the whole restaurant to myself, yus!  Their menu has quite the variety. From basic scramblers to eggs benedicts (my fave). I got the irish eggs benedict which consisted corned beef, hash brown, muffins, potaties and a whole lot of hollandaise.   I wanted something small and didnt expect how big their portions are here. This thing was huge!! Bigger than my face, seriously. It was mouthwatering and it was indeed delicious. I loved it! I requested my hash browns to be extra crisp and they did that for me well.  The server was very friendly. I am sure when this place is busy they maintain a fun and upbeat attitude.  Colorful decor; sort of random but hey its homey. Mason jar water cups and looks like they have quite the bar for their mimosas which I didnt get to try buuuut I certainly will sometime.   Coming back for sure.",

We came in with a group of 9 after waiting for over an hour (which we understood and agreed) they told us we could not be sat together. Ok no worries we were sat in different tables. When the bill came they charged us automatic gratuity we asked why? They told us with was for groups of 5 or more. We told them we were in a table with four then they called the \"manager\" which is also the owners daughter. She came and told us the same info we told her we didn't understand because we were not a group since they sat us in different tables, she came back and said well didn't you guys have the same server!!? I asked so what is it the same server or same table? She was so mad she rolled her eyes and just walked away from us. I asked our server who she was and told him to look at her as she approached our table she was storming over shaking, he just smiled and agreed with us and apologized. She brought us the bill shaking and we asked why are you shaking she said because this is ridiculous she dropped the bill and said you guys figure it out and walked away then another guy came and said they are doing us a favor by taking the group and splitting our table. We told him he is not doing us a favor by splitting our table. We told him he wasn't doing us any favors if he wasn't supposed to split our table he shouldn't have done it we couldn't have conversations and we would have ordered a big mimosa flute if we were together. We will never come here again Valeria's attitude was so inappropriate there was not a real conversation with her and she automatically was upset. She is immature and should not be in customer service. Needless to say we won't be back prices and food was something we can get down the street.",

They have giant mimosas that look fun to order, but i wouldn't order unless i was at least a party of 4 because it's a lot to drink for breakfast for just two! They have a full bar, which is a bit odd for a place that closes at 4. I ordered  a crab Benedict and the egg was poached for too long and might as well been hard boiled, but the overall taste of the dish was really good and the hash browns were prepared perfectly. The mimosas are little pricey for the quality sitting at $8.50 a glass. Would definitely try again as they seem to have a good menu and the giant mimosa looks like it'd be fun to drink with a few friends!",

It's nice that you went to the beach but was it really worth it? Not really. We almost had a full hour wait to be seated by the restrooms and a vulgar couple. The ice cream tasted like frozen milk. The bacon had a jalapeno taste w/o the spice. The banana foster sauce was just caramel. Somehow the whole thing felt like drinking almost flat Sprite. My whole party felt like the staff wanted to ignore us but didn't.",

    "text": "The reason this place gets one star is because THEY DON'T HAVE MIMOSAS! Upon sitting down and looking at the menu they have taped a notice over the mimosa portion of their menu saying they don't have a permit to sell mimosas. I don't know how long they have been open, or if they once had them, but they lose all integrity if they don't have the item they are named for.   The reason this place could get two stars is because their food is decent. I tried their biscuits and gravy. They weren't my favorite because they were spicy and had a southwest taste to them, rather than your traditional home-style biscuits and gravy. I did not like that, but I could see other people liking that. I also tried their eggs benedict and their country potatoes. The eggs benedict was unremarkable. Their country potatoes, like the biscuits and gravy, were a little spicy and more southwestern, made with bell peppers and onions. I'm not opposed to this, but it should have been described in the menu better, as that was not the style I expected. I also did not care much for their coffee. I will say that their pancakes were amazing! Even though they were huge, they didn't have the too much like cake feel, and had a perfect crisp to the outside and the perfect consistency on the inside. Maybe the food would have tasted better with a mimosa? I'll never know.    The reason this place doesn't get anymore stars is because the ambiance wasn't amazing. The decor is sunflower yellow colored walls with mediocre paintings of flowers. The service was good and the servers were nice, but nothing that stands out.  There was no line, and I went during weekend prime-time breakfast hours. It is a smaller sized restaurant, but has tables to accommodate larger parties.   But guys, there are NO MIMOSAS!",

My friend got the southern scramble and it was hands down delicious! The biscuits had perfect texture and the gravy was full of flavor. We got a pancake on the side and it was HUGE, super soft and moist.   Totally excited for them to get their liquor license and try their mimosas. I'll definitely be coming here regularly.

The use of real eggs is a huge plus in my book. I had the waffle combo - it comes with eggs, bacon or sausage and a waffle. This place is pretty much on par with other breakfast food places with regard to price. I'm definitely going back to get the huge mimosa. It's a small restaurant but it appears to have a strong following in the community. This is a nice little place tucked away in the corner of a strip mall.

Start with his omelette - perfectly cooked meat, oozing with cheese, eggs were fluffy - so much yum!  Now, the fried chicken benedict - I ordered it with country gravy instead of hollandaise sauce, so it was - 2 biscuits, fried chicken (tenders maybe - breast pieces) topped with cheese, 2 slices of super thick bacon & all covered with gravy. The cheese melted into the bacon and OH MY GOSH heavenly!!! The gravy wasn't too salty, the chicken and as tender & had a crisp outside. The biscuit was fluffy and OH so good! I loved this dish!   The potatoes weren't my fav, but our kids will rat them so they won't go to waste:) staff is still super friendly & hunny tipped very well because I was so super happy with the flavors. We might have to bring the kids next time so we can try some pancakes & waffles!   *****************  Nice atmosphere, friendly waitress.  First time here - the menu is extensive! Lots of diversity and selection. Nice variety of mimosas too.   We ordered corned beef hash with over medium eggs & hash browns and a meat lovers scramble skillet. Unfortunately, our meal came out incorrect with scrambled eggs instead of over medium. The home made corned beef hash had a ton of potatoes in comparison to the amount of beef in the dish. Standard hash browns. Hunny enjoyed his meat lovers skillet but would have enjoyed more without the sour cream drizzle. Again, lots of potatoes in comparison to the meat.   Our waitress was very nice. Apologetic when we pointed out the error. The meal hadn't been touched, so they took it off our bill without any questions. We will try again another day.",

Their waffles are great as well as omelets. I did not care for the country fried steak & eggs. Amazing service by all servers! I'd highly recommend for large portioned breakfast, strong drinks, and REALLY good music vibes!",

They even treat you like family too, can't say enough good things about this fun brunch restaurant. When in Vegas you must come visit.",

Mimosas Gourmet is about 15 minutes from the strip but worth the venture if you like delicious food and the most original mimosas on the planet. Also, if you're down to drink an entire bottle of champagne in the form of a mimosa, that's an option! No juicy juice here, ladies and gents. The giant mimosa *will* get you sauced.  My husband and I ordered one with guava and pineapple and it was ah-ma-zing. We also ordered breakfasts foods (I can't recall precisely what it was and you shouldn't blame me) and they were tasty, huge portions. Don't hesitate to come here and have a ginormous mimosa. Do it for the 'gram! You won't regret it.  (Sidenote: Please share. A giant one for a single person is probably conducive to alcohol poisoning and nobody wants that). Cheers!",

It was a generous serving size and it was pretty strong! My husband ordered the Irish coffee and a regular coffee. They did not charge him for his regular  coffee!  I ordered the diablo skillet with the jalapenos on the side. I enjoyed it! However, I don't know if I would call it a \"skillet\". My husband had the chorizo scramble and said it was tasty but a bit dry. I think it came with salsa and they just forgot to bring it out. We shared an order of French toast and it was ok. I wouldn't necessarily order it again. Big portions sizes. I took half of my skillet home.  Service was fast and the staff were nice and welcoming. I will definitely be returning and trying out other mimosa flavors!",

After looking over the expansive menu she decided upon the Chile verde omelet with a pancake side and I chose the huveos rancheros. We waited for about 15 minutes for them to bring us our food. Oh boy..... let me tell you when they brought out our selections.... we were in foodie heaven. Everything was cooked to perfection!!!   The omelet was full of flavor, had amazing texture, and the pork melted in your mouth. The huveos rancheros was to die for you could tell everything was homemade and seasoned just right. The portions were humongous! I didn't think I could eat the entire thing.......... well here I am with a bowl full of jelly. Haha but seriously my belly is so full. I couldn't help my self.   Did I mention that we forgot about the pancake because our meals were so good? We ate our entire meals, and then had to give that puppy a try. The pancake was heaven on earth. It tasted like a funnel cake in pancake form, but better. I didn't think I had any more room left to eat it. However, it was so light and fluffy that the whole pancake got eaten between the two of us.   I love this spot. Eat here if you want to enjoy your experience through and through. Please don't let the strip mall deter you. It almost stopped us..... but it was well worth it!",

The parking lot was pretty empty and it didn't help that the windows were plastered with cheesy menu photos all over. Like other reviewers, I almost considered trying the French cafe next door since pastries are always a great idea!  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by two friendly servers. The vibe is homey and cozy. It is definitely a locals joint.  I ordered the Herb Chicken skillet which consists of homemade country potatoes, herb chicken (obv), jack cheese, onions, garlic and asparagus. The platter was HUGE. If you have ever been to Hash a Go Go, the serving size is pretty similar. The meal came accompanied with a homemade biscuit. I rate this meal 5/5 since everything was delightful. The potatoes had great seasoning and were nice and crispy. The chicken was juicy and well prepared and the biscuit was one of the best I have ever had.  Our servers did not miss a beat when it came to refilling our water glasses and checking on our table. They were jolly and super friendly.   The reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is due to the water tasting funky. However, the mimosa made up for it! I will be returning, it was worth the drive and money",

    "text": "My husband and I joined friends for brunch at Mimosas recently and loved our brunch. The mimosas were plenty strong too. Christie L. made a good pick on this one.  The menu offers plenty to choose from for brunch, almost too much! They offer scrambles, waffles, salads, benedicts, French Toast, omelets, pancakes, sandwiches, specialty entrees like huevos rancheros, burgers, and skillets. Even the mimosas are offered in about a dozen different flavors. Don't worry if mimosas aren't your thing because they have other drinks like Bloody Mary's too.   We started with mimosas that were strong. They were served in a large round glass and had a nice flavor. The mimosas were a bit different than traditional mimosas, but still good. The flavor was similar to a sparkling soda.   My husband and I shared three dishes, all were great! My husband ordered a sandwich that was tasty, but the homemade fries were the highlight. The Crab, Prawn, and Avocado Benedict was large and delicious. Everything on this dish was perfectly prepared and I loved the side of crispy hashbrowns. As much as we enjoyed these dishes the highlight of brunch had to be the Churro Waffles. These were amazing with such a great flavor. Just to add to the decadence the waffle was served with an entire scoop of ice cream on top.  The service was quick and attentive. Even in a group the service didn't miss a beat. Our food came to the table without much of a wait. We didn't have any issues with getting separate checks at the end.",

Perfectly seasoned and the portions are HUGE  For dessert we had the Churro waffle. This is a very sweet dish, as well as a perfect fit that will definitely feed at least 2 people.  The service was also perfect. Attentive and pays attention to details, my wife has a shelfish allergy and they were more than accommodating to cooking with fresh utensils that did not previously touch their seafood dishes.  All in all, highly recommended!  Pro Tip: We came during the week, and it was not busy at all. But the server said that their peak times are Friday-Sunday between 10am and 1pm  Happy Eating",

The only reason why it isn't a 5 star in my opinion is that it just needs a little refinement (Employees relaxing at tables while people are still dining, eating their lunch while people are still dining, and the overall decor). Although I'm not opposed to this, it's definitely not five star material.   Onto the food... Tasty! Inexpensive! And served in a timely manner, I have nothing bad to say about this place. Corned beef hash that my girlfriend received was stellar corned beef and my pancakes were amazing (still did not surpass my favorite pancake & that is my breakfast of choice).   Again, thank you to the entire team for delivering an overall great experience that sent me into a food coma for the rest of the day.",

They quoted us it would be an 30 min to an hour wait and that was fine with us, but as soon it hit almost two hours and seeing many parties pass us even with big parties it made us wonder if we were skipped. I get that the business is busy, but at least communicate with us that we are coming up. If we didn't communicate with the host, we probably wouldn't have gotten seated. Almost 60+ people got sat before us and there was no communication amongst them about our party.  Typing this is super disappointing because I've heard great things about this place, but after waiting for so long, the experience is ruined and to top it all off it was hot inside the business. AC wasn't on and they kept the door open, we then again had to tell the host and a waitress to turn on the AC for everyone and they finally did after arguing with them. Never coming back here. Really poor customer service.",

It was basically a feel of American/French and heavy handed Mexican cafe but put on cool plates and presented a little nicer. The staff had that I just Rolled out of bed feel , made me feel comfort as we shared that much in common. Very friendly by the way. Allot of Spanish speaking across the room from kitchen to staff and Spanish commercials in between songs made me feel like I was back home in California.. love it!   Best chile verde I've had in a long time. This will be my New favorite Mexican Breakfast Spot. Pfft and the whole time I was looking for a place with salmon,pinched egg covered in beurre Blanc with a glass of fufi champagne lol This place is Solid GOLD!",

    "text": "A mimosa place that can't actually sell mimosas. I know that they are working on their liquor license, but it's odd. You can bring your own bottle of champagne,  and I did on my return visit. They looked genuinely excited that I brought my own and immediately grabbed an extra pitcher and filled it with ice and water to keep it cold. They charged the 2 of us for 1 juice even though we got 2 different flavors to make our mimosas with.   As for the food, everything has been solid.  -Nutella pancakes: There is an absurd about of Nutella on there to me a non-Nutella lover, but I can see how someone would love it. But my boyfriend said that he wished it didn't have marshmallows.   -Corned beef hash: My favorite so far! I love the horseradish sauce on it and the insanely large biscuit.  -Gorgonzola scramble: I love gorgonzola, so this was a no brainer selection, but it wasn't enough food to me. -Bacon waffles: They actually crushed bacon and put in the batter. Bacon in every bite! -Brunch burger: Pretty solid. Also very large.  -Fried chicken benedict: Very large biscuit with above average gravy with rosemary.   Most meals here can easily be split. And they serve breakfast til 4 on the weekends!   My favorite memory is going there close to close and hearing a song by Mystikal that was not sensored. We were crying laughing as was the table behind us. Don't worry parents this has never happened again, but I'm kinda disappointed that I have not witnessed another slip.",

Can I just that the people who work here are some of the nicest people.  They were on top of everything! The food was delicious!  Everyone in our party ordered something different and everyone loved their dish.  The mimosas were soooo good!! They come in a huge cup, so its really like 2 or 3 mimosas!

Their menu has a lot of unique dishes that I have never seen anywhere else. Orders are large and all very delicious. Their hash browns are made so well, I like to ask for mine extra crispy. The Croissant Sandwich is really good and different, it's croissant with broccoli, cheese, ham, eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  DRINK: Coffee is served in a cute large mug. Cold drinks are served in mason jars. They are not serving their mimosas yet but based on the variety of mimosas on their menu, I know it's going to be great. Can't wait to try their lychee mimosa and their guava mimosa!  ATMOSPHERE: Small little restaurant with not much going on. Just a simple breakfast shop. The waiter was nice.",

There was nobody there. we were seated. And asked if we wanted coffee,water,orange juice etc. the lady there is great. Friendly,nice,great service,place is very clean,chairs and seats are comfortable. We asked her for a recommendation. I got the corn beef hash. The corn beef is made in house. Comes with homemade seasoned potato's,eggs, orange slices, and you get a huge homemade biscuit. My  wife got salmon eggs Benedict's.  I tried her breakfast. It was amazing too!  The food is amazing. The portion are huge!!!   HUGE!!  I will be going here again for breakfast very soon. AMAZING PLACE TO EAT AT!!",

The chef came out and greeted us and asked us how the food was as well. Talk about customer service! BY THE WAY, the portions are huge! If dining with a group, I highly suggest sharing the dishes so you can try more of their menu out.   We ordered the short stack pancake, which was so big, we had enough for lunch. The flavor was nutty, buttery, the texture, fluffy and soft...just perfect. I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which tasted HEAVENLY...you can easily pass this place as it is tucked away in a plaza on Durango.   If you're planning to eat at Hash House, might I suggest you ditch that place and head out to Mimosa's? You'll thank me later.",

[Edited] I had the corn beef hash over country fried potatoes. looking at the picture (again) and reading what was in it I was expecting a delicious meal. If it wasn't for the awesome customer service from our waiter Jose and my wife having and excellent meal I would of gave this place a 1 star. BTW my wife gave them a 5 star on yelp. My wife and I agreed my pork was very bland and I hardly had much pork as it was. I had basically a skillet of potatoes my side of pancake was very good but for what I paid I was disappointed to basically only have a skillet of potatoes. It was around 3pm and maybe they where running low on corn beef hash but I would of picked something else over mostly potatoes.  My wife will probable convince me to go back and if I do I will update my yelp review. but a cool place, very noisy and a little cramped but an experience worth trying because of the super mimosa and our waiter Jose.",

I decided to try mango and pineapple while my friend got guava and strawberry. I don't know how much champagne they put into it but let me tell ya, I was feeling a little buzzed, so no complaints there! For the food I decided to try the crab, prawn, and avocado benedict while my friend got the smoked salmon skillet. We both got the side of homemade potatoes. I thought the potatoes were okay. It was seasoned nicely but I do prefer my potatoes to be a bit more on the crispy side. The benedict I got was delicious! It had nice amount of crab, prawn, and avocado. The hollandaise sauce was smooth and completed the dish well. I didn't get to taste my friend's dish bur she did enjoy it. The dish is big though and she had to box the rest home. Later the server told us this dish is the biggest meal they have so if you want to get your money's worth, the smoked salmon skillet is the way to go!",

Instead of going for the super mimosa (which was very tempting), my sister and I decided to try a few of the regular size mimosas. I went with passionfruit the first round and guava the next. My sister started with cranberry and tried prickly pear next. SO good. The atmosphere was very chill and welcoming. Wasn't crowded and service was timely. We both decided to go for the Denver Omelette. (Or what we Easterners call Western Omelette). We also shared a classic waffle. The omelettes were amazing and so cheesy!! Definitely plan to visit here again next time we are in town!",

Or share Mimosa w friend/ loved one/ partner/ etc/ for $34.99 I had the California omelet, bacon, mushrooms, green onions, tomatoes, jack and cheddar cheese, topped with avocado and sour cream. $12.50 Sister had Berry Berry French Toast Blackberries, Strawberries, & Blueberries with whipped cream and raspberry sauce. $11.95. Everyone works together as as team here to make sure everyone is happy. If you haven't tried Mimosa Cafe, what are you waiting for? Check it out for yourself, you'll be glad you did!",

The only two complaints I will say, is that they do not currently have a liquor license, so the mimosas that are advertised are not available. Second being that it seems like the restaurant is a work in progress. It seems that there are a few decor pieces missing from the walls, and it's a little dark in certain areas of the restaurant. I definitely think this place has a lot of potential and did see quite a few UberEATS deliveries being picked up too. Will give a new rating when we can finally try a mimosa.",

    "text": "We loved this place initially, even took friends but last visit was so bad we won't return. Misunderstandings occur but this was pretty bad. We ordered 2 standard breakfasts:  2 eggs with country potatoes and side of toast.  We opted to upgrade to a bagel and I told waitress we'd split the bagel.  The order arrived and seemed skimpy..but we just thought it was the cook that day.  I decided to go ahead and get the English muffin that came w meal and asked another waiter to bring it.  Bill arrived and we were charged for the English muffin so I questioned it because waitress had said it came w mesl. At that point we didn't know waitress had misunderstood and split our entire breakfast.  So the mgr came over and started arguing with us saying we weren't entitled to another order of bread free.  It was baffling. Then she got mad and voided the charge for the whole meal.  We were still trying to figure out what she was talking about and why she was angry when the waitress said \"you don't get two breads when you split a meal\".  Case solved.  She split our entire breakfast.  On top of the meal being skimpy dye to her misunderstanding, the potatoes were cold as they left them sitting up on the pick up shelf while cook made the eggs..ridiculous and we got our breads after the meal.  It was all pretty bad.  From the loud blasting rap music to an argumentative mgr to a waitress that doesn't comprehend English.  It left us with a bad taste in more than one way.",

We went here for the first time on Sunday and we ordered the big mimosas drink. At first sip we all tasted bleach which was weird so we asked the server why is there bleach in our drink his response it's the straws. They are sanitized in bleached and rinsed to be reused. I was completely shocked as to why they would bleach straws instead of giving new straws. Well come Monday night I got sore throat and Tuesday morning my tonsils were swollen along with high fever of 102-103. I finally got time to go to Urgent Care and I was told I might have mono or strep. I am currently on medication but still in a lot of pain. Please be hygienic and clean the straws the right way or give us new straws. Keep in mind I don't eat out much and mostly eat at home. For me to get sick is very rare. I won't be coming back to this place again. Just for their hygienic reasons.",

I also called to have them look up my order and repeat my special notes just to make sure they got it right. When my order arrived NONE of the items where in my bag. Not even syrup for my waffles and that's crazy. Two of the waffles come with powder sugar and I even called and asked to make sure it was some on the waffle and on the side! So I called back once I realized my stuff was missing and they came back to redeliver what was missing and there was still no POWDER SUGAR!!! lol how can they be that dumbbbbbbb?!

It was good, nothing special, its huge so i took half home along with like 75% of the giant pancake! (Pancake is still fantastic the next day. ) My party ordered a meaty skillet and that was also nothing special. Potatoes are a little bland, but everything was fixed with the nice hot sauce they had there. Really enjoyed this place (basically just the pancakes) lol",

I love this place the food is so good, I know they just opened but I feel like this place should be bursting at the seams with people.   I initially tried this place bc of Groupon ...  and trust me I'm so happy that I did.  I love the service the chefs, owners ...  but the food is 5 stars, my friend said the chilaquilles were as good as his moms (I'll have to take his word for it this is the first time I have ever had it) but the crab and prawn Benedict...  it's delicious best I have ever had, I have had a lot of bennies in my life but this is a memorable one.  The seasoned potatoes are a must.  Perfect executed the hollandaise is fresh and not too thin or thick, the English muffin is perfectly toasted and the crab and prawn patty is all meat, everything well seasoned with a perfectly poached egg and some avocado to tie it all, well this is a dish that will bring you back.",

The homemade orange juice and biscuit are so delicious.  The biscuit is huge and soft. The rest of my family enjoyed their Huevos Rancheros, steak omelette, double cheeseburger. I definitely recommend this place. I can't wait until they start serving their famous mimosas. The service was great, little wait time, the food was served warm and we continued to receive round the clock service. This is one satisfied customer!!!",

The omelettes were good but standard fare. The home potatoes with onion and peppers were very good. They are cutting cost by keeping it too warm in the dining room. Not good sweating while eating. Will we be back.... Maybe.",

Serving sizes are big and their potatoes are AMAZING!!! My mimosa was good although I couldn't really taste much mango, mostly champagne hahaha That's not really a bad thing though! They even have massive ones for I believe $35 so your whole table can share (or just you lol). I put us on the wait list through the Yelp app and when we got there, we checked in and were almost instantly sat. So cool! If the restaurant you're looking at has a wait list option, do it! It'll make your life so much easier! Definitely recommend this place! It was pretty packed when we came too, which is always a good sign!",

    "text": "Update: the server just messaged me requesting to take down this review and called me a liar. How about \"Sorry for your poor experience, how can we make it better next time?\" Proof of horrible customer service. After trying to go back and forth with me claiming he didn't try to over charge me, he mocked me saying \"haha I have the proof I did not do that\" this is the type of server that is at this establishment. He wrote to me under the name Jose.  Their servers call people who left honest poor reviews \"liars\" and mock people through messages. Calling me a liar after he brought out over charged slips for my bill. He kept calling me \"sir\" in the messages even though it was a table of 3 girls! Doesn't even remember so how can he call me a liar?  The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the food is good. The service and respect just isn't there. They don't take reservations so I called to put my name on the waitlist for a party of 3 prior to getting there. They told me about 45 mins-1 hour. They then text me 30 mins later saying my table is ready even though they told me 45 min-1 hour. I went to the hostess to tell them my friends are not here yet but will be here in about 10, mins. She told me she had to give my table away then. Even tho it wasn't at the 45-1 hour mark. After my friends showed up I told her we are all here and she said we would be next. Then I see her seating people who got there after us and when I asked her how much longer she said \"Well I already had your table ready.\" Then after we ate we asked to have the check split between 3 of us. An $81 bill should come to $27 each. They charged my two girlfriends $27 and then the waiter charged me $60. Doesn't even make sense. So I asked him if he could correct it and he tells me \"don't freak out.\" Ok..... not freaking out! Just pointing that you charged us $60 more.. we then ordered two more drinks after the bill and he kept showing us in our face \"is this right? See the check? This is correct right?\" Mocking us. Not our fault he didn't calculate right the first time. Then after being there about 90 mins the waiter basically comes over and kicks us out because he have been there for 90 mins and there is a 90 min limit. That's fine but if I'm still finishing my drink and we had to take 20 mins out of our brunch time so you can fix our check then that is NOT the customer's fault! We also were all being stared at by everyone until we got up and left at about 95 mins. Will never come here and don't recommend it. AND THERE's NO AIR CONDITIONING! people were literally fanning themselves with the menu. In Vegas when it is 96 degrees that is unacceptable!",

Staff was really friendly and tentative, price point was reasonable, and they spot was definitely better than your average.  :)",

We tried the guava, prickly pear and lychee. Lychee was by far our favorite - not too sweet and really had lychee flavoring you expect. As far as the food goes, it's your basic breakfast place. Lots of Benedict options, omelettes, French toast options. The food was good - probably not the best breakfast food in all of vegas but worth coming in (mimosas or not)!",

    "text": "I can't say enough how much I love Mimosas. I write this review selfishly hoping no one else feels the same so that I don't have to share or wait hours on end to eat.   First of all, the mimosas. So many flavors. I've tried almost all and have yet to dislike one. Standouts for me are guava and kiwi. And if you're feeling extra lush, there's a huge mega mimosa that runs around $30. Which is saying a lot because the individual serving is rather massive. I can normally power through a few rounds of mimosa with brunch and be fine but I always catch a buzz here by the second bowl. Yeah, I said bowl.  They don't serve little skimpy flute here. You got a damn mini punch bowl. And you'll like it. Dammit.   But it's not just the mimosas, the food is great, too. The portions are generous, the flavors are on point, and there is a great selection to choose from. Oh and for $1, you can upgrade your toast to a pancake the size of Cinderella's pumpkin that I think qualifies as one of the best in the valley.   But it's not just the mimosas and the food, the service is fantastic. The servers are genuinely friendly and attentive. It's always great when the staff seems proud of their restaurant. To that end, I probably would have taken longer to try to kiwi mimosa had it not been for our server mentioning it was her personal favorite out of their new flavors.   The location can be a bit tricky, but just look for the Arby's.   Do yourself a favor and grab yourself a mimosa... or two. Or more if you took a rideshare in.  Cheers!",

The orange and watermelon are fresh juices and the rest are concentrated but all looked amazing. They have the jumbo one to share that is an entire bottle of champagne for $35! We had the Irish Benedict and the crab and prawn Benedict. Both are second visit worthy. The home fries are better then the hash browns in my opinion but to each their own on that one. Coffee was good and the bartender was friendly. What more can you ask for?",

The food is well portioned and incredibly fresh. I ordered the crab prawn avocado benedict and I was pleasantly surprised by the generous serving of crab and prawns.

Overall I will return to this spot!  It was great food and drinks!  Just the seating and the spitting of the bill were my issue, nothing to scoff at when I was looking for food!  The food was great and so were the mimosas!  PLEASE GIVE THE SPOT A TRY!  Technically they should have got 4 stars but the splitting of the bill worked out against me and the seating sucked!

We called a head of time to reserve our table since we had a large group, we were told about 20 min wait for our table became over an hour. After finally getting in, we immediately looked at the menu, ordered our drinks and food. Food came out pretty quick and kitchen was busy. Once everyone in our party got their food, we all started to eat, BUT the moment I looked down on my plate, I saw a long hair in my sauce and stretching out on my over easy eggs. Waved down  a server to fix issue and they took my plate away. 3 min later they came back with my re-plated food in a smaller plate and re-cooked eggs. One mistake kitchen did wrong was to send my food in a smaller plate, they should've at least re-plated on a same size plate as the first plate it came in the first time, which already gave the hint that kitchen only made new eggs, took the hair out and added more sauce. Price for the meat lover skillet meal I believe a little pricey for having tons of large diced potatoes and carne asada size cut meat, sausage and bacon, could at least cut the beef a little bigger. Server also explained that my meal would be taken out of the check which I did appreciate for having a hair in it, but when we were done dining and ready to pay, my meal was still on the check, when then we called the server over. They also have a drink special that came in a very large wine glass, which a customer who just turned 21 ordered that sat adjacent to our table. She had 15 minutes to finish it and if she did, she would get it for free, but that wasn't the case, poor birthday girl threw up and made tracks running to the restroom, we were at least done eating before the incident happened. Overall, place is rocking and would probably give them another try.",

And i never even received a text message in the first place and who deleted them selfs from the waiting list and stays around for over 45 minutes hungry?? that makes no sense at all! and instead of the host idk trying to help us out she instead said well it's gonna be more wait time or you can go eat somewhere else? that to me translate \"i don't want your money\" i work in customer services there's always the right way to say i apologize for the inconvenience let me try to get you in as soon as i can..",

Mimosa Gourmet can't serve mimosas??!? Well aside from that my party was happy with the food that was ordered. If you are a fan of hollandaise sauce, you need to go try this place. The sauce is homemade, not from the frozen varieties that most restaurants serve.   I took off a star due to the lack of mimosas and as it took a little long for our food to come out and the stale coffee.",

Shots for the birthday people, joking with everyone, Football game on the screens, food was in large quantity and amazing. Towards the and we didnt finish our mimosa and they even offered to go cups for this. HOW AMAZING! Most places would have yold us to finish it, not them. And Alex was our server from start to end this guy was a jokster. He made us laugh and feel welcomed. Definitly a must visit for anyone looking for a great off the strip BRUNCH place.  We will definilty be coming back again and recommending to everyone.",

Let me tell you. Every component on the dish was prepared and cooked to perfection. Most places have dishes that are too salty or too sweet- not this place. Not only are their dishes super flavorful and high quality, but they are Very generous with portions.   Hats off to the chef because the chicken was well seasoned and breaded, the biscuit  was moist and soft (best biscuits I've ever had), the gravy was super delicious, along with the perfectly cooked hash browns on the side.   Now to the French toast. They make their bread homemade here, and you can tell. Thick cut French toast with delicious toppings. I would say this is the best French toast I've had in years. The service here is super friendly, very quick, and it's a very cozy atomosphere. Next time we will try their mimosas, I'm sure they are to die for!",

Muffin base, tons of salmon, poached egg, add spinach, red onion, and capers, and top it all off with hollandaise. It tastes even better than it looks, and I ate way more than my stomach could comfortably hold just because it was so tasty. The home style potatoes with peppers and onions went really well with this and the excess sauce on the plate. When I come back, it's going to be hard to take a chance ordering anything else!  The Chile Verde Omelet was a less successful dish for us, but I'm eyeing the Chicken Enchilada version for next time. Note that you can substitute pancakes for your side of toast for just a buck- and theirs are made with a sweet cream buttermilk and they're good even eaten plain. I love that their coffee cups are so large, so we didn't need to look around for refills. Service was attentive and genuinely friendly, will be coming back soon for more.",

It's fresh, clean and spacious inside. We were greeted right away and made to feel welcomed. After drink orders, we were left to look over the menu. They serve breakfast and lunch, so it's a rather large menu.  My husband asked to start with the Nutella waffles, they came with bananas, berries and whipped cream. The waffle was crispy around the edges and the mixed berries were fresh.  For my breakfast, I got the chili verde and eggs. It came with choice of eggs, potatoes, re fried beans and corn tortillas.  Everything was tasty and cooked well.   My husband, a big eater, got the chicken fried steak  breakfast, came with mashed-covered in milk gravy. Just a little different flavor, had rosemary in the gravy. He got scrambled eggs and hash browns. Really big meal!   Overall, good service, great food and decent prices. We will come back for breakfast for sure but better yet we'll try lunch.",

Looking  forward to another. Great breakfast  Went to Mimosa again today. Got to say the best pancakes I've had in Vegas bar none.

The mimosa was okay; A little on the sweet side with the puree and champagne combo. The overall experience was great though. I am a fan of customer services and theyvarr at the top of my list.",

I went with the breakfast quesadilla and my boyfriend did the pancake combo. Pancakes were really good! Big size, good flavor, soft and fluffy.  Wasn't thrilled on the mimosa's which is what I was looking forward to the most. I got the prickly pear and took 2 sips. It tasted like cough syrup. I informed the waitress towards the end of our meal that I didn't like it, sure she could tell by how full my glass was and she apologized, took it back and we didn't get charged for it.  Would possibly go back if in the area but not somewhere I would drive out of my way to go too.",

The service was impeccable, warm, friendly and attentive without being intrusive. Everyone was genuinely nice and put their heart into everything they served. And oh my God was the food good! It was unbelievable delicious! The portions are truly enormous (my fluffy, light, heavenly, homemade buttermilk pancakes were bigger than my head!) everything was fresh, homemade and delicious! The chef is definitely creating world class cuisine in this little spot-its like a secret that has yet to be discovered. The Mimosas were made with hand squeezed orange juice and were so light and refreshing.  And they have a wide range of menu options for breakfast and lunch, something sure to please everyone. Mimosas Gourmet offers high end food without break the bank prices. They definitely could be charging more -huge portions and the very best ingredients but the bill was extremely reasonable. When they found out it was my mother's birthday, they made her feel so special and the owner even came over to give her a gift certificate for a free future meal. I can't recommend this restaurant hard enough...I have lived and traveled around the world and know a good thing when I see it...Mimosas Gourmet is a hidden gem and you should definitely check them out before everyone discovers them and you can't get a seat!",

We walked in and pretty much had to seat ourselves. The bench wasn't bolted down nor were the tables which seemed strange. The food took forever to order and was bland when it came out. I ordered a protein scramble and had to cover it in tapatio in order to eat it. The home style potatoes looked like they would be flavorful but they left me disappointed. My friend ordered the corn beef hash and said the same thing. The service was alright but it took forever to get our check and even longer for them to pick it up. Now, if a restaurant is busy I am more patient but when there are only 2 tables that are occupied, there is no excuse for poor service. I will never return to this place and would turn anyone away from here.",

    "text": "Decided to try breakfast one morning around 9:30am, think it was a Monday or Tueday.  I ordered the breakfast quesadilla with home fries while my partner just had toast and jelly with his coffee. Coffee came in huge mug-like coffee cups, and was quite good. Toast came next, along with a good selection of Smuckers jelly pods to choose from, including strawberry, mixed fruit, and orange marmalade, my favorite, even though I wasn't the one eating it today.  If I had known how huge my quesadilla was going to be, I probably would have looked for something smaller, because it was so packed with eggs, cheese, sausage, and bacon in a tortilla sandwich that covered a huge plate, I could barely eat a quarter of it with some potatoes and a little side of chipotle type salsa. No problem. It was tasty and filling the following two days as well after having to take the leftovers home.  Service was good and the management kindly turned down the somewhat loud music for us to better conduct some business after our meal.  I hope to come back for the churro waffle and ice cream soon.",

One of the workers after taking someone's order is standing behind the counter eating what seems like her little sisters food (which is weird to have at your workplace and behind the counter) but she's eating her food then comes out to take an order while chewing.. The inside is not appealing to the eye. Way too many color schemes going on. They seem to care more about the uber eats and postmarks orders than the customers that are right in front of them. Overall I may return but only if I have nothing to do for my day cause the food also took quite some time to get to me. 6/10",

I walk in and im immediately suspicious of: Purple and yellow decor and the lack of people inside. We sit and look at the menu which was pretty big, and I decide on the veggie skillet and proceeded to talk about how these breakfast places never have something for vegetarians, just vegetarian options. I was being petty.. .   The food comes out. I knew at that point that I was so wrong. And should be ashamed of myself. Lol. The portion size was a bit above average which is code for perfect. I've been on the vegetarian spectrum for quite some time and I feel like this was one of the best representations of vegetarian food. (lacto-ovo specifically) the veggies tasted so good. The sauce to veggie ratio was good. Like it felt homemade. I just can't get over it.   My girlfriend had the corned beef and she was gushing over her plate for a while as well. She was a fan of how well cooked the onions were. But the beef was the star for her.   All in all. The prices were decent. The decor is just as goofy as all other breakfast diners and the food is the bomb. Will return many times. Hope they last in that terrible location.",

Today, however, a sign was posted on the front door, and in the menu, that they're waiting for their liquor license. C'mon county, give them their dang license!! Also today, they had a table set up outside with complimentary coffee while you waited for a table. We didn't have a wait but it was a nice touch.   I've had the meat skillet, veggie skillet, Mexican skillet and the eggs benedict. Never have we left disappointed with the food.   Even without the alcohol, I'd highly recommend this place.",

Everything tasted great, the Hollandaise sauce had good flavor, just enough Crab, Shrimp and Avocado on a toasted English Muffin. The grilled potatoes with a touch of onion and peppers was great with a really large portion. Even the coffee was outstanding, it had sort of a European, French Roast flavor.

However, my potatoes were just \"Warm\" like they've been sitting for a few minutes after it was already plated and ready to go. The food didn't really give me a wow factor. But the portions was on point.   I thought this place was cute and the food and portions were good. I'm taking one star away because it took a while for our and the place wasn't that busy. I already finished a cup of coffee and my wife finished her mimosa by the time we finally got our food. Granted I saw a lot of Uber Eats bags being prepared but still. Hungry customers aren't a good thing! Lol.   I would return for their portions and the convenient location. But I was a bit disappointed for that missing \"wow\" factor.",

We came from Chicago, saw this groupon and couldn't pass it up. $26 for $40 worth of food for 4 people is a great deal, drinks were on point and hats off to the chef. Quick tip: If you are not familiar with this spot they give generous portions (lots of food), beware!! 5 stars for sure.. must try. We will be back!  Thank you, Mimosas Gourmet & Las Vegas!",

Bread, potatos, meat, butter (lol) sour cream, good omelet and great service. Being a huge mimosa lover myself, I perused the different mimosa juices. The lovely server suggested lychee, and just one put me in the clouds. I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else in Vegas for brunch except for one place on the strip. Good job guys",

Everything was good up until the food was about to be served, everyone got their food my other friend finished and my food was still not out I literally had to cancel it and eat somewhere else. You suppose to at least bring half of the orders first and proceed to the second half nxt but no they serve the 1st half and did not serve our 2nd part instead they keep serving other tables when we are still waiting for our. Drinks are good portions are decent but I'm not coming back here no more. Kitchen sucks and servers sucks.",

So obviously that's a bummer.   BUUUUUTT, I was very impressed with their quality of food, cooked fast and served with a smile. Let me warn you by saying that MOST MEALS ARE ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE. I had the CHURRO WAFFLE (topped with vanilla bean ice cream, powdered sugar, cinnamon, syrup and butter in the side) it wa so good and made fresh. I also ordered the breakfast TORTA. It was all so delicious!! I loved my breakfast sandwich, they forgot to add the Avocado, but that's ok - the chillies were absolutely tasteful - I warn you though - the sandwich IS SPICEY - it's not overwhelming if you enjoy spicy food - but opt out if you can't handle a kick.   My server was friendly and accommodating. For a Saturday morning it was not crowded or loud inside. I was completely satisfied with this meal! Minus the alcoholic beverages. Definitely coming back!",

This restaurant was great bec they had plenty of breakfast options and lunch options!   One funny drawback? Even though they are called Mimosas, they do not serve alcohol. No alcohol license yet. BUT, they do allow you to bring in alcohol from the grocery store next door, and create your own alcoholic drinks!  The staff was incredible friendly and attentive!  We ordered the burger and huevos rancheros. The meat for the burger was not very good. Pretty dry, and just poor quality. However, the sweet potato fries that come with it were amazing!!!  The huevos rancheros were good. Not amazing, but good.   The decor inside is a bit odd. I think perhaps since they are still new, they are still transitioning into their decor. Seemed a bit unfinished inside.   Overall, we left nice and full and this restaurant satisfied our 1pm breakfast cravings!",

She was very efficient with giving waters but that was it . We sat there watching the server help everyone else but us. I thought maybe they were not getting our food order since our whole group wasn't sat but that was only a guess, because no one else came to talk to us! We never had a server ask if we wanted drinks or even ask when the rest of our group was joining. We were dismissed. A group of 3 were sat about 15 min later and we said if they are helped before us we will leave . Well, they were approached by the server within 2 min so we left.",

I called ahead for reservations BUT I was surprised to know that I didn't need them. Perhaps this is still a hidden gem-- definitely not in an area you would think to have brunch at. Anyway, YES you can make reservations, unlike several other brunch places, is a really nice service.   They have a little set up for coffee outside which is SO nice of them-- free coffee while you wait.  Their menu is vast! So many good things to try. Portions are comparable to Hash House-- shareable and humungo!   I had the crab/shrimp omelette covered in hollandaise with a side of hash browns and a pancake. It was really good. My friend had the fried chicken benedict- our server gave her the option of two sauces which was really cool (gravy and hollandaise).   Service is quick, efficient, and very friendly. If you check in you get a free coffee with refills.   I'll definitely come back and I hope this place picks up momentum because it's definitely a must eat.",

The fried chicken Benedict was amazing and we asked for hollandaise/gravy (you can taste test it before, but I recommend both)! The super mimosas were a lot to handle, but the four of us finished them so I know anyone can! Chilaquiles was DELICIOUS according to my friend, too! They are very accommodating to everything you ask for! I will be back every time I visit Vegas",

The pancakes and the potatoes were great as always but I was very disappointed when I found the hair. That can ruin your whole meal.

Our glasses were never empty and food came out quick and hot. I had the crab Benedict that was absolutely delicious!! My friend had the chicken Benedict with these huge homemade biscuits....yummy.

It was fun watching the birthday boy wearing the Mexican hat and the staff singing happy birthday! We all clapped as well! Staff is very attentive and helpful.  I had 2 sunny side up with home made potato, some French toast (choice of white, sourdough, wheat), we ordered that huge pancake for the little one (size of a dinner plate) and my friend had an omelette with potato The portion was generous (could feed 2)  We had coffee and regular mimosa Great place for breakfast!

I mainly came for the food, but I did order a prickly pear mimosa since you know, that's what you do at a restaurant with Mimosa in the name. I think if you enjoy champagne, then I say go for it. The drink and I weren't really vibing well, so I got a pina colada instead and that was really good, nice and refreshing and not super sweet.   Now the food, I was very excited to try the food because i love breakfast and the menu looked amazing. I order the bananas foster French toast which was pretty much like desert since it came with vanilla ice cream. The French toast was good but the flavor was a little underwhelming. I was expecting a bit more spice.",

It makes it fun and silly to drink this with the squiggly long straws.   Now onto the food: our group always likes to get a little bit of everything and share -the corned beef is homemade and super delicious and tender. The potatoes are perfectly cooked and seasoned. -the nutella french toast was scrumptious and ooey gooey withe melted marshmallow mixed with the nutella and was the perfect sweet to the salty corned beef. I'm definitely getting this combo next time I go.  -the biscuits and gravy were tasty. It is a huge portion. I think I would've liked it more with chunks of sausage in the gravy and a little less sage.   This is a great restaurant. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home and the food comes out super fast. There wasn't a wait on a Sunday either.",

The chili verde was very good and the beans were delicious, but the tortillas looked store bought and for the reviews I saw I expected more effort on their part.    Overall the food was decent for the cost, but not extraordinary as some reviews might insinuate.",

The only issue was that there were no champagne for mimosas, due to these guys not having their liquor license yet. My wife asked could we bring our own liquor in, and the waitress said yes. So a 5 star went down to a 4, and quickly shot back up to a 5. Enjoy!!!",

We will be back to see the growth, changes and mimosas! Only thing we found is the music choice should be more suitable for all and bathrooms need to be cleaned.",

Upon our entrance to the restaurant there was no one to greet us at the door. After waiting nearly 5 minutes we sat ourselves at a booth next to the front door.  We waited another 10 minutes before we were finally greeted by a server who wiped down the table & brought menus. She apologized for the wait, walked a way, and eventually returned to take our orders.  It took nearly 45 mins to receive our food! My order came out incorrect (short stack with a side of hash browns & bacon) so I told the waitress what I actually ordered. She walked away, only to return with the same plate less the eggs. I repeated, once again, what I ordered. She shook her head and proceeded to tell me what the waitress rang in. I let her know I didn't order that and would like the mistake corrected. She walked away & finally came back with the proper sides.  At that point I was no longer interested in the meal. I had a bite to eat off of my husbands plate & was finished with breakfast entirely. The food was pretty descent, but definitely not worth a nearly 2 hour wait start to finish. Needless to say we won't be returning.",

They use pinto beans and they are full of flavor, they really stand out. The hash browns are Dennys type and we all know that is our fave and they do them better than Dennys. My bestie had the French Toast with scrambled and bacon. Bacon crispy and big slices. Absolutely worth the price. Their shining star is the fresh squeezed orange juice, not one pulp in sight!. When they do get their license, their Mimosa's will be out of this world. I'll be back next week to try something else. My only suggestion would be to do the Huevos in a skillet; I like to get the eggs sunny side up on top and let that yolk sink in. Love this place! The service is perfect as well.",

However, that doesn't discount their ranking as a breakfast hot spot. Alcohol aside, I really liked many things while dining here. The atmosphere is good, there was no wait to be seated, the staff is friendly, and the food is decent. I personally wouldn't recommend the breakfast quesadilla - but I think that is because I have been highly spoiled in the Mexican breakfast delicacy department. My boyfriend's Southern Scramble was delicious but I think it should be under the benedict portion of the menu - if only because of the confusion of not getting toast. The part of the menu it is under now states that toast comes with the meal, sub pancakes for some change. However, when you tell them you want either toast or a pancake they will inform you that the item is in the wrong section and that because it comes with a biscuit it doesn't come with any of the sides the other items in the same section do. If I came back here I would try a benedict or a traditional breakfast - I get the feeling that's what they are really good at.",

Kids had the mini pancakes bacon and eggs, which they split cause they get 6 mini pancakes. Food was amazing, so sad to see a place with amazing tasty food but awful service.

We ordered the Chile Verde and egg breakfast and fajita steak Benedict which were served in pretty large portions. And u MUST TRY the Churro waffle!!! It's huge and delicious and it has a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!  We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu and bring people to help us finish the monster mimosa!",

Half of the buildings in this strip mall are vacant, belying the literal amazingness in a glass in this brunch spot. The owner sports a T-shirt that touts brunch was invented so you could have mimosas. She darts about the place all of about 5 feet( even standing on a stool at one point to work the register). But her imprint looms much larger. Her team ( which includes at least one daughter) works within a choreographed efficiency that indicates years of matriarchal deference. And her instincts are spot on. The food was solid. My corned beef hash was not from a can. It was embodied with delicious and tender corned beef, plenty of red potatoes and a smattering of red onions and green peppers. Two eggs perfectly cooked over medium topped this mound of yumminess. A massive house made biscuit accompanied. Hubster had the California Benedict, which he could not finish. The Benedict looked amazing. The Hollandaise was a bit on the cheesier side than I preferred, but Hubster did not seem to mind at all. Can we talk about the Mimosas?  Freshly squeezed orange juice. 'Nuf said. Generally my only requisite for a five-star mimosa.  But when you name something after a drink, you'd better do a good job. The flavors!  So many. Including the benign alternatives like pineapple or mango. This place offers Prickly Pear, Mango, and Watermelon.  Just Go!",

Easy-going, not pretentious, \"brunch\" place with a TV or two to entertain sports fans.   Would be good for families....parents deserve brunch too, darn-it!  Food was yummy enough that I'll definitely go back, but the pancakes and lychee mimosa are REALLY why I'll be back!!!     Large portions and definitely above greasy spoon diner status but not so bougie that you need to throw on full makeup and hair.  Yoga pants will do (plus you'll want the stretch!!).    Prices are reasonable.    I had the Benedict with steak & avocado (can't remember what it was called, but it was waitress-recommended) and it was fabulous & very filling (took home half).  My BFF had the chicken and waffles.  We're from the south, so obvi we've had better, but by Vegas standards, not too shabby.    The pancake tho was out-of-this-world good.  I don't know what you can do to pancake batter to make such a delish disc of carbs, but man, I'll be back for more!!",

Once our party of five was seated our server took our drink orders and they came out quickly. My friend and I sampled mimosas and my husband and another friend had beers. The mimosas were tasty, we had peach and pomegranate. Everyone agreed the pomegranate was more flavorful. Our server was very attentive and came by at the right time for our food order. When the food came out everything was correct, hot, and fresh. I had the herbed chicken skillet. The chicken was actually moist and had a great flavor to compliment the breakfast potatoes. One of my dinning companions let me try the biscuit and gravy, the biscuit was airy but thick and the gravy had the right amount of pepper. It was a great meal, the service was fast and friendly, and the food is well worth the price. Can not wait to go back!",

    "text": "Being enticed by their name and loving Mimosas I thought this place was a must to visit when trying to decide on a Sunday Brunch, extremely disappointed to find that they don't have a liquor license and don't actually serve any mimosas. After reading some of the reviews i became a little curious. A review 5 months ago states they didn't have a liquor license, another review from 2 months ago she reviewed how the mimosa wasnt that great and now they have no license again?! Makes me wonder why they keep losing it. Anyways.   You seat yourself pretty much. They did greet us right away and take our order. Caution the water tastes just like water from a hose so order something else to drink. They do have lots of different juices and they did taste pretty fresh.  We ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and the strawberry waffle. The chocolate chip pancakes are HUGE! Two pancakes serves with strawberries, whipped cream and drizzled chocolate syrup. Definitely large enough to share.  The waffle was a typical size topped with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and served with a side of maple syrup and butter. The food was good. Unfortunately the fact that it took so long for it to come out was a bit of a turn off.   Overall, not a bad experience but nothing out of the ordinary or something that stands out. Maybe if they ever get a liquor license and actually sell what their name says it might be different.",

    "text": "I found Mimosas Gourmet here on Yelp, and decided to try it due to the 4 1/2 star reviews it currently has.  My less than stellar 3-star review was mostly due to service.  Drinks::  we each got a mimosa, which were served in large bowl-like glasses.  They were good...not amazing, but honestly about what I expected for the price.  I think they were almost $9, and the size was equal to at least two typical sized mimosas.  The large shareable mimosas were at almost every table, and looked fun to share if you were with group.  Food::  I got the corned beef hash platter, which really was quite good.  The corned beef tasted fresh and was more like a pulled pork or a tender roast then what one typically gets with corned beef hash.  I had asked for the horseradish sauce to be on the side, and they gave me some on the side, but still put it all over my meal...so that kind of ruined the dish for me.  My boyfriend got the juevos rancheros.  He liked it, but did say it was very spicy.  He also had ordered an iced tea, which we had to ask three different times for before they brought it (at the end of our meal).  He also had ordered a side of toast that he never received.    Service::  as I mentioned above, the change request was not done correctly, and two food items were not brought to us without being repeatedly asked for.  Our waiter also never came to see how our meal was until we were done eating.  Although he was friendly, we just were not happy with the service, and likely won't return because of this.    Atmosphere::  it was a small restaurant with many tables pretty close together.  It had more of a New York crammed feeling, which isn't necessarily bad...just different than what is used to here in Vegas.  The restaurant is pretty loud and busy feeling with most people there drinking large amounts of alcohol.  Again, not bad, just definitely not a quiet place if that's what you're looking for.",

Personal experience we had a few order complications with getting the right dishes and having order issues. Sadly the recovery process was very delayed which is why I provided a lower rating.   If in Vegas and don't mind leaving the strip it's a great little spot to try out.",

    "text": "A few of my friends recommended this place to me for brunch. After watching the video of their giant mimosa, I had to come try!!  First off, if you're coming for weekend brunch prepare to wait at least an hour! Unless you come right at open, there will be a constant line of people. Although they do have the yelp waitlist, we ended up waiting an additional hour after the check in time. I joined the yelp waitlist at 12:15 and arrived around 1:20. Upon checking in, there was 7+ parties ahead of us. While waiting, we were removed from the waitlist for some reason. Not sure if she called our name but we were standing right by the door the entire time, so probably not. Fortunately she placed us back on. We were not seated until 2:15. So long story short: the yelp waitlist will not guarantee 0 wait times.  The food was extremely underwhelming. My friend and I were EXTRA HANGRY. Usually when im super hungry anything tastes good but both our dishes left us disappointed. I got the fried chicken Benedict with hollandaise. Their hollandaise is more of a thicc flour water mixture with yellow coloring. There was no butter flavor. The chicken was cut up in small pieces and the scrambled eggs were extremely tough/hard.  Of course we had to order the giant mimosas, which is probably the one decent part of our experience. They have a variety of flavors you can mix and match to add on to your mimosa. However, I noticed the flavors are just simple syrup. I know it's harsh to judge a mimosas on flavor (I mean it's just champagne and juice..) but this mimosa was MEH. But.. our server poured an entire bottle in one glass! Pretty cool experience, but I'd rather pay $15 for bottomless at literally anywhere else. Also, most of the other brunch spots in summerlin give you fresh juice or concentrate which I find tastier to mix with. I noticed they were handing out shots to birthday people which seemed a lot of fun. They sing, dance, and take a shot with you! The servers were all kind and seemed to be having a good time.   Overall, it's pretty over hyped for brunch. I could list you so many other solid brunch spots that are NOT gimmicky and offer quality food and drink. If you want to experience the giant mimosa then go ahead, personally this is not where I would brunch ESPECIALLY if your visiting Vegas as a tourist.",

Taylor and I tried them out of convenience, but we will be back for sure:)   Mimosas may be their namesake, but they have an amazing jalapeno Bloody Mary that could be on any high end bar menu; superb quality and balanced, but SPICY! They have a full bar for all your other hair o' the dog needs.    They also have a big menu and reasonable prices. We both did the basic breakfast, and everything was tasty. Food came out super quick, even for a diner, and the staff worked as a seamless team to deliver prompt service in a busy, but modest dining room.",

On my visit specifically, there was definitely a younger crowd and to say the least they were all definitely having fun! Personally I don't care, but just Incase you're someone who doesn't like coming to places that can be loud or have elderly family members who don't like it, I'd suggest just coming on a different day where they won't be as busy. The food itself was great! The only reason why I'm taking off a star is because the corned beef skillet was very shy of corned beef. It was definitely good, but for $15 I'd expect more.",

The menu has a lot of options, but I decided on the chicken apple sausage and eggs, with homemade potatoes and a side pancake.  And of course I had to have mimosa!   The food took a bit longer than I would like, but it was busy so that may have been the reason. It was definitely worth the wait.  Everything tasted fresh and flavorful.  The pancake was huge and cooked perfectly.  The only critique of the entire meal was surprisingly the mimosa.  It was ok, nothing special. I ordered the prickly pear mimosa.

Minimal decoration at best.   Service is ok. Often, they're a little slow coming to your table to get your order. They are quick about drinks, but to get your food order is the slow part.   The food is the real shining part of Mimosas. Everything is flavorful and HUGE portions. I can never eat all the food. I can't get over how good it is, which is what keeps me coming back even when the service isn't the fastest.   I do warn: if you come here later in the morning/early afternoon, it is super busy & you'll probably end up waiting a while. The earlier you go, the less busy it is and you can usually get seated pretty quickly.   Overall, definitely recommend! Soooo good!",

Kind of tasted like a green apple cider   There's already water w/ straws at your table when you arrive, as well as cups for coffee. Our service was fast, friendly, and good all day.   I got the BBLT (bacon, lettuce, tomato, extra bacon) & fries. Everything was great! The sauce was very interesting. I couldn't figure out what it was but it tasted delicious.

I didn't get the chance to look much at the menu due to late arrival BUT my super random choice did not disappoint. I ordered the fried chicken Benedict and while it wasn't diet food it sure was some comfort food. A friend got the California Benedict that was super yummy and a lot lighter than my meal. We tried a short stack of pancakes and their pancakes are perfect and fluffy! So good! I'll definitely be taking another visit there because it's so yummy.

    "text": "A pretty great breakfast spot. They're more known for their mimosas I believe, but the food is just as good and HUGE portion sizes.  My boyfriend decided to get the salmon Benedict with hash browns and I chose to order the waffle combo. With the waffle it also came with eggs and a choice of meat but I decided to get hash instead.  Service is really nice and on point. Every time the water was low, it was always refilled. Food came out fast.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his benny, as did I with my waffle!   I would come back to try more things! Especially those mimosas!",

    "text": "Unassuming little corner spot off Durango and Desert Inn. Let me start by saying that the portion sizes are HUGE!! None of our party of 5 finished their meals. You really get a lot of food for the standard brunch prices. The food was well prepared if anything it was under seasoned (which I prefer to over seasoning) nothing a little table salt and pepper couldn't fix.    While the food is well prepared and tasty the star of this menu is the mimosa! Obviously you expect a great mimosa from a place called Mimosas Gourmet! I am happy to report that they did not disappoint!! There are several flavors to choose from and they are rather large glasses filled with more sparkling than juice. I had the Prickly Pear and Lychee and I was also able to sample a friends Pomegranate flavored mimosa. They were all delicious, but I am a sucker for prickly pear anything so that would be my top recommendation. They also have a Super Mimosa for $35 which is huge and can be split between a table of friends (I personally don't like the concept of big straws in drinks for multiple people, I would prefer to ladle out my portion into a separate glass vs swapping spit with my table mates).   I wouldn't necessarily come back just for the food but I would definitely come back to sample more mimosas and have a decent breakfast accompaniment.",

It was leaning on a big mound the size of a softball and all of it was covered in a great white sausage gravy. The mound turned out to a huge biscuit. All of that was on one plate; the second plate had home style potatoes and two eggs. The second plate was absolutely fantastic - I can't believe how good it was. Their seasoning was perfect: I would eat that every day for the rest of my life and be happy. The eggs and potatoes disappeared and the UFO flew home in a take-out container. My dining companion ordered one thing on the menu and his food came on 3 plates! Actually, one of his plates was the size of a small table and the pancakes on it were bigger than a large Frisbee. They ended up flying out alongside the UFO in its own delivery truck. Tons of great tasting food, and it was inexpensive too. What a find!",

Had the Huevos rancheros with the potatoes it was Amazing! Chorizo and eggs, were delicious the kids had pancakes and they were the bomb! Coffee and Hot chocolate were Delish! The only thing is we found this place on our last day in Vegas :(  Sorry forgot to take pics of the food. We found our go-to spot for breakfast when we come to Vegas!  I've already told all my friends about this place...can't wait to come back!",

The gravy was exceptional wth sausage and Rosemary!  We had the biggest biscuit I've seen in awhile.  I wouldn't call it a biscuit as it taste like a cross of a good biscuit and a really good dinner roll.  Need lots of butter and Jam!  Hash browns and eggs cooked perfectly!  We r going back to try other things on the menu.   Clean, friendly and fast service! Right now I say it's a hidden gem for breakfast!  Let's see how my next visit/review goes!

The portions are very large so if you aren't a big eater, you could easily split a meal.  We had the mimosa and the prickly pear mimosa which was delicious.  The prices are very reasonable considering portion size as well.  Also they are very generous with the mimosa as well.  The only reason I am rating a four star is the music is extremely loud.  It is very difficult to have a conversation and our waitress was kind enough to turn it down.  However one of her coworkers turned it back up.  Otherwise, our waitress was very good and overall a nice breakfast and drinks.",

Why does the service take so long if the restaurant isn't packed? Once our order finally arrives to our table I find that it has green onions on my meat lovers skillet which I very specifically did not want and double checked with our server, Alex. After telling him how disappointed we were with the experience, being it was our first time, he apologized and left. Then someone from the kitchen wearing a hairnet comes out to our table attempting to take my plate saying she's gunna remake my order so it's correct. She was extremely argumentative and abrasive. I would stay away from this establishment at all costs. Unless you like being yelled at and intimidated.

It was delicious but I wish they served it with something other than hash browns because there's already potatoes in the hash, but other wise delicious. The Nutella marshmallow French toast was to die for. Bring a tooth brush because this has enough sugar for the entire year. I recommend sharing this one. The steak skillet and the chorizo omelette were also full of flavor.   The service, this is where they lost stars. Our waitress threatened us before we ordered so that was really a damper on our meal. We ordered four mimosas which is the name of the establishment. After 3 came out they told me they couldn't make the watermelon one because it would take too long. I was staring at the watermelon on the counter and just ordered a different one because from the beginning our waitress was rude. This mimosa never came and I decided not to bother. They obviously charged us for it but were really nice and apologized for it. I really wish I had a mimosa though.   All in all an interesting experience, probably won't go back because I don't like to be served by rude people. But the food might tempt me to go back. I really want to try the churro waffle (this is a note to self)",

I was skeptical at first (I've tried my fair share of pancakes in town) but the moment I tasted a sweet bite of crispy, fluffy heaven I was sold! Perfectly crisp, extremely moist, fluffy and not swimming in butter; it's the perfect recipe! (besides our homemade pancakes)   The short stack comes with 2 massive pancakes for only $7 (Rated: 5/5.) That's a great value and could probably feed 3 adults if y'all into sharing and that wild stuff.   We also ordered the crab, prawn and avocado Benedict $14 (Rated: 4/5), which also comes with your choice of hash browns or potatoes. The portion is also larger than 2 adult appetites so we had a lot of leftovers (No one is complaining!) I loved the hollandaise sauce and the flavor of everything combined was great. The perfectly runny yolk and crisp edges of the english muffin were a tasty touch.  BYOB (BRING YOUR OWN BOOZE!) They have been open for 8 months now and still don't have their liquor license yet. I was looking forward to trying their advertised mimosas but was turned down.  Once they get the mimosas show on the road, I'll definitely try it out to see if my 4 stars can be pushed to 5!",

Mind you, these mimosas are strong as hell and will mess you up lol.  Service: 10/10! They were always attentive and the cook obviously takes pride in her skills (i.e. she comes out and asks \"how's my cooking?\"). She is an AMAZING breakfast cook for sure!

I will say that flavor seems to change from time to time - we had a same dish 2 days in a row and it was great on the first day and had good flavor - the second day we had the same dish - I had to throw it away. I will say that the burgers are very good! Service is typically friendly and fast; but the space itself is quite crowded in most cases.",

Great breakfast/brunch food, due to the name was surprised its kind of a little mexi spot. Went on a Sunday morning, no wait at all and they had all the football games playing, they did also have a tv with church on.  Everyone there was super friendly and talkative. It wasn't just our server that would check up on us! Felt very welcoming.  You can also purchased a HUGE mimosa to share comes with funny straws, good for the IG post if you're looking for that.  TIP * anything with the biscuits is going to be HUGE. Both the people i went with got something different but ended up going home with leftovers!",

Quality ingredients, well prepared food, and lots of it! No matter what you order, you'll enjoy the taste and you won't walk away hungry. You can't lose eating here. The name \"Mimosas\" is misleading, but \"what's in a name?\"  For my first experience, I enjoyed a Corned Beef Hash Skillet. There was no sign of that dynamic dual that usually appears on a restaurant Corned Beef Dinner. Both Hormel and Dinty Moore, were not there. Instead it was a well prepared brisket, done up right, and served with two eggs, over easy, and a huge portion of cottage potatoes. Very good.  This is a place that I will take my sons to for lunch. The menu is deverse as it is good, and those two hungry Neanderthals will enjoy a meal that will satisfy them for the day.   Okay, Mr. Jack, why not break down and give them a 5?    Because they are only open for Breakfast and Lunch. Do go there, before you drive out and wait in an hour long line for Cracker Barrel. This place is much better, and more reasonably priced.",

The nutella waffle was amazing. It comes with a side of delicious syrup, although entirely unnecessary as the nutella is enough for flavor and the sweetness (that didn't stop me from dipping a few bites into the sticky goodness).  The chicken fried Benedict is perfection (go with the half and half- gravy/hollandaise sauce, but the hollandaise is perhaps my favorite ever, and I'm a slight snob about the stuff ;) ) The mimosas are worthy of the name for the restaurant.  Large and worth the $8.50 price tag.  We had the prickly pear, pomegranate, watermelon, and mango.  All were fantastic, but the latter 2 were our favorites (mango being the winner).  The staff was phenomenal!  Checked back often enough to be awesome, but not so much that they were over the top.  Friendly, cheerful, and attentive.  Just go.  Trust the reviews, it's worth the drive - although an uber isn't a bad idea if you'll have more than one mimosa!",

Oranges are freshly squeezed there, salsa is made in house. The whole crew feels like a family, and truly is passionate about what they do. We went for breakfast and it was really good, but not just the food; the whole atmosphere was amazing. We would rent a car next time just to go back.",

While we waited there was ice cold water :). They checked in with us every few minutes letting us know they were getting our tables together. We sat down and immediately brought us water and took our orders promptly. Super friendly server. Not only does your server take care of you but everyone else in the restaurant plus the owner comes by and makes sure you are good. The super giant mimosas were great! The food... Oh man... AMAZING!!! We all tried one another plates and each of them was sooooo great from Breakfast to lunch order. Potatoes are the most amazing things I've ever had.  Th staff made everything so much fun as they got involved with getting our party rowdy with hats and pots and pans congratulating the newly weds in our party.   If you want BOMB ASS food and an amazing time with amazing service then you should get your Butt down here! Worth 15 min drive from the strip.",

    "text": "I would not recommend coming here. Me and a friend came to try out the super mimosas and get breakfast. First of all, the server didn't even bother to introduce herself or give any information regarding the menu or drinks. She was extremely rude and mocked us because we didn't know how to drink the super mimosas which are extremely hard to drink because they continuously spill on to the table. You would be better off getting the individual mimosas IF you want to come here. After we ordered, the waitress did not come back to our table once. The busser is the only person who actually bothered to check on us. When it came time to pay, the waitress sent another waitress to come and drop off the bill. We payed half cash and half on card, which should be simple enough. However, when the waitress grabbed the bill off of our table, she accidentally dropped the card on her way back to charge the bill. She came back to the table and told us we were short on the cash for our bill. We let her know that we put cash and card in the server book and she proceeded to tell us that there was nothing there and that we're short. We then got angry and asked if maybe she dropped the card because we were 100% sure we put it in with the cash. She didn't even bother to look for it and said she didn't drop it. One minute later after looking, we found it on the floor. So she did in fact drop it and didn't even bother to help. She didn't even care or offer an apology after we found the card on the floor. Horrible service and waitresses. The place has cobwebs in the corners of the windows which we noticed prior to anything happening. The food was decent, but until they learn to give proper service, don't waste your time.",

    "text": "Very cute lil restaurant! It was our first time there and although it was pretty busy, we were seated almost right away. They have really fun-looking giant shared mimosas in dif flavors along w other mixed drinks. The breakfast menu is extensive including standard American  options, Mexican choices and even sweet treats like flavored pancakes and French toast.  Someone celebrated a birthday and amongst the busy-ness, several of the wait staff made a huge fun raucous for her including a song & a sombrero.  The staff was running around a bit frantically, but I have to praise our server Manuel. He was patient as we changed our minds on orders, noted all of our substitutions properly, and was very knowledgeable about the menu. Also he was friendly and alert despite how busy he was. The homemade corned beef hash, basic breakfast, and protein scramble were all very tasty. The only reason I didn't give this  place 5 stars, is that one of the young female table runners forgot 2 parts of my mom's dish, and seemed annoyed when we asked her to bring the sides we were entitled to and had ordered.  Other than that, I highly recommend this place and if possible, request Manuel!",

    "text": "This is probably my favorite breakfast place in town.  The food is absolutely amazing and reasonably priced. The menu is easy to pick from with plenty of options. Starting off with basic breakfast, skillets, scrambles, Benedict's, waffles, omelette, french toast, pancakes, specialties like chille verde, breakfast burrito... the list goes on but it is such an easy pick.   Service was very prompt and waiter( Alex) was very personable as well as helpful. To be honest Everyone that works here has a very good team chemistry. Great way to give customer service.   On to the mimosa and Michelada...  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!   So let me tell you about a drink that almost had me ask for a bed because I was full and lit lol   They have this really big mimosa that I had to stand up to drink. Granted I'm 5'3 but still. They call it \"super mimosa\"  literally the biggest goblet I have ever seen. It has fresh pineapple juice, a bottle of champagne and some syrup to add flavor, by the time me and my friend left this place, not only were we full but we were lit ! Lol   I recommend the \"super mimosa\" specially if it's a party of 3+.   Absolutely amazing !",

Everyone was so nice and accommodating and well informed. Made you feel like you were at your Tias house!  FOOD was BOMB!!! ordered the chilaquiles anos chile verde. Both were just like your abuela would make.  The chilaquiles were made with chile rojo and chorizo. Crema anos queso fresco on top and 2 eggs made your way underneath or on top as I got them. Must get the country potatoes  they are SOOOO GOOD!!!!!  my meal was so good and authentic would go back again and again.  Hubby ordered chile verde,  which comes with beans, 2 eggs your way and choice of hash browns or potatoes and tortillas. This was also BOMB!! Servings size are just right, at best prices!!  DRINKS of course we had mimosas! You can mix two flavors for the same price,  so I had prickly part and lychee which was just the right amount of sweet (not overly sweet), my hubby got mango and kiwi,  which he said was sweet and sour probably not the best mix,  lol but he drank it. They were more than happy to change it for him but he decided to just finish it. I swear these drinks were 2 mimosas in one,  they were big!   This place is a MUST try if you haven't already,  seriously come here and try you won't regret it, great start to my day!!!",

I was in between the corn beef hash and the chilaquiles and the waiter had said both of those are their top sellers so I went with the corned beef hash.  Yes their portions are huge and the plating was nice. My plate came with country potatoes on the bottom topped with not so tender corned beef and on top of that two eggs drizzled with a horseradish sauce. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the drizzle of horseradish was actually pleasantly good but the rest just had that off-putting taste of grease. It also was accompanied by a biscuit but it was more of a dense dinner roll and some recycled looking orange wedge to finish the presentation.  Just not great at all.  Service was okay, a little rushed. I think the oversized party looking mimosas is what brings people here.",

    "text": "Have been to this place several times.  This was our first visit on the weekend.    We decided that a Saturday afternoon brunch would be a good idea.  Knowing that it would be crowded.    We arrived and were seated pretty quick.  We each ordered fairly quick.  The music was really loud this visit.  We could hardly hear each other across the table.    Our waiter was good at getting us drinks.  It was really hard to hear the waiter and the waiter to hear us.  This may have contributed to several problems with the order.  The food was ok. As always the skillet was great.  Several mistakes on my sons plate and my wife's.  Their plates didn't come out as ordered.  No cheese on the hash browns and to much gravy on chicken fried steak .    The waiter was informed when he return and the chicken fried steak issue was fixed.  The brought out a new side of hash browns.  They weren't cooked well and had two slices of unmelted kraft singles on top.  The manager said they were having problems in the kitchen and offered us a free dessert.  We declined because we were full.  I would have expected a slight adjustment off the 48.00 blll, but the waiter said for us not to tip him because of the service.  Maybe 5.00 off the bill would have been ok.   We did leave a smaller tip than usual, but we walked away with a sour taste that the business that made errors in the kitchen would expect the waiter to not get tipped instead of a couple dollars off the bill.    Truly a little surprised. I have always enjoyed this place, never had a problem, but my visits were during the week in the past.  I will return to this place, because we all have bad days.    I just suggest that waiters not take the hit for the business.  If the service was bad I would agree.  It was clearly the kitchen today.  So live and learn.",

The outside of the venue isn't the nicest area, but inside the restaurant is a lot better and relaxed.   THE FOOD. My friend and I had the chilaquiles, which had chorizo and red sauce. The potatoes were red and cooked to perfection... all topped with quesco fresco, YUM. It was the best chilaquiles ever hands down.   On top of the great food, once again the service. They treated us with the Churro waffle and it was soooooooo good! True hospitality is hard to find, but these guys specialize in it. I will be coming back the next time I'm in Vegas! THANK YOU.",

Came here when it was 110 degrees out and I'm not sure if their AC was out or what but it was so hot in there. I didn't even finish my food, rushed to pay and ended up leaving because I couldn't take how warm it was getting in there. Probably won't come back, and wouldn't recommend that you go during the hot summer months.",

I assumed the chicken would be wings but it was chicken tenders and they were not my idea of fried. The waffle wasn't bad but I've had better.

Maybe they NEED the bacon as flavor?  And what's with these careless places dumping powdered sugar all over the chicken and barely leaving any on the flavorless waffles that needs the sugar?  Chicken strips, country fried steak, biscuits and gravy.   All eh.   Nothing special.  Not good, not bad since we were hungry.     The guava mimosa was really good.    Service felt rushed.  We were ready to order and server wasn't sure whether to take our order or take the order from some other guests.   I can only assume since they were there first that our server expected us to order drinks, than wait until she takes someone else's order and then come back to us to take our food order.   I came to that assumption because we told her we were ready to order and she kept looking at the other table as if she had to be there.",

The establishment was so small and busy, people were literally waiting in line outside. Not to mention it was 100 degrees inside. On top of it being Mother's Day It was my man's birthday they brought shots and made him wear a Sombrero while they sang happy birthday to him, it was great! I came for the mimosas, which were served in a margarita glass instead of a champagne glass, with no ice. Needless to say I was a little disappointed. Nonetheless, I will be back to experience this establishment again, this time on a regular day to get an authentic experience.",

Although I can't drink because I'm pregnant, I thought it would be a hit still since the food looked so good.   After arriving I was pleased be immediately seated & the restaurant wasn't too busy at all for a Friday. I originally wanted to go to a favorite breakfast/brunch spot that has recently closed to get one of the best chorizo Benedict's I've ever had, but decided to opt for the one here instead. I had only water that was immediately brought to the table & my boyfriend ordered a lemonade. I don't think the server appreciated that I only wanted water.   We ordered & a little while after our food came out. My boyfriend ordered chilaquiles which he really enjoyed. I asked for my hash browns to be well done/crispy because I know how sometimes in a hurry things are prepared fast, but they looked like they were barely browned but only on one side with the center undercooked. Truly my plate looked a mess. I do understand when you order eggs Benedict it isn't always the prettiest, however it just looked thrown together. There was barely any chorizo & smothered with so much hollandaise my muffin was soggy first bite. I truly didn't want to complain because I was so hungry, but my boyfriend looked so disgusted.   All in all, I will be sure to try something different if I do ever visit again. After getting home, I realized that there wasn't even any avocado on my Benedict that CAME with my meal, which was even more disappointing. For the place to not have been busy at all I thought there could've been more effort put into my dish.",

The menu is loaded with lots of delicious items, the full breakfast fare plus burgers, sandwiches, and salads. We went with the smoked salmon benedict and the fried chicken benedict.   Both were delicious. Fried chicken benedict was tasty, the sausage gravy very mild so add your own pepper. I enjoyed the smoked salmon as well, maybe more cream cheese. Hollandaise sauce was nice and light, not clumpy or heavy. I would have liked a slice of lemon to add some citrus to it.   I heard the pancakes were great, and the plates that passed by would confirm that. I will be back again to try those.   Overall, I liked the food and presentation very much. Service was on point. Price was fair at under $50 for two plus Bloody Marys. I will return.",

You can't go to a place called Minosas and not order a mimosa! Sampling a few of the flavors, mango was my favorite, although all were good. And strong, they were definitely strong!  The food itself was also very good. Most of the dishes were massive servings, great for saving some for later. Everything tasted great on all the dishes we got. The only downside brought up was all the benedicts lacked that runny yolk you crave.   Kind of a smaller place, so expect a wait if you go during peak hours, but you can also expect good food, fast service, and strong mimosas!",

    "text": "This place is extraordinary. I was searching for a place that had bottomless mimosa's during the week, and stumbled across this place. That being said, they do NOT have bottomless mimosa's, however, they do have about 10 different flavors. My wife loves mimosa's so we drove over a half hour to this place because... Mimosa's. It was worth every mile, as this was a gem. For food, she had the smoked salmon Benedict, and I had the Irish Benedict. Believe me when I tell you, the corned beef was NOT from a can. She said hers was incredible, but I didn't try it as I'm not a fan of salmon.  She tried two different types of mimosa's, the Peach, and prickly pear. She preferred the prickly pear (it was incredible) but seriously loved them both.   I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this place. We will be going back on a regular basis, even if it is clear across town. If ONLY they'd open one on the east side, or downtown",

Our waitress and waiter ensured that all of our needs were being met.  I had the Corn beef hash plate with the red potatoes!  It was \"off the chain\" tasty. I also had a pancake which was the size of the plate!  My son had the Cinnamon French Toast and that was very tasty as well.  Huge thanks and shout out to Carlos and the others that provided excellent service.",

    "text": "There's no better news than hearing that Mimosas Gourmet can finally serve mimosas!! Although I came for the Sunday brunch mimosa, I stayed for the Nutella waffle combo. It's a homemade waffle with Nutella, strawberries, bananas, and whipped cream. If you're not a huge fan of sweets then you can also opt for their skillets, benedicts, or sandwiches. All of the pancakes, French toasts, and waffles have the option of turning it into combo which includes bacon, sausage or ham with two eggs of your choice. The restaurant isn't too big, so to save yourself the wait for a table it's best to get there before 10 or after 1 on the weekends. The service was also very friendly and there wasn't too long of a wait for breakfast. I'd definitely like to come back again.",

They have the super size mimosa for sharing too and it's a gallons worth, definitely will be worth the share next visit. The food was sooooo good, and huge portions!

Environment: The exterior of the restaurant is a little bit underwhelming, with the restaurant being in the middle of a strip mall and with a lackluster banner. Upon entering, the inside is open, however I would not say it is much more impressive than the outside. I think it could use a different color scheme or maybe some more decorating.   Food: The food was good, and the portions were very generous. I ordered the Mexican skillet which came with potatoes mushrooms, avocado, sausage, and salsa. All the flavors went together well and it was very filling. Additionally, it was served which a biscuit which was HUGE. A point I did find interesting is that upon looking at the drink section of the menu it had stated that they did not have their liquor license so they were unable to serve any alcohol, which seemed a little contradictory since the restaurant has the word mimosa in the name yet we were unable to order one. Despite this the list did look extensive so once they do get their license I would be more than happy to try two or three of them haha.  Overall I don't know if I will come here again any time soon due to the location but if you are in the area and are looking for a nice breakfast spot I would recommend trying this place out",

    "text": "I'll admit that most of my 2-Star review is based on the owner/manager not accepting my Groupon that was for 4 people (we had a party of 3).  We spent well over the Groupon amount and I thought, like my other favorite sit-downs (Egg Works in Summerlin and Shabu Shabu on Sahara), this place would honor the Groupon, especially that we had spent at least $40 over the Groupon amount.  To top it off, owner/manager was pretty rude about it by saying bluntly \"should've read the fine print\"... I know, petty.  But you're in the business of customer service!  Wife is an Egg Benedict's connoisseur and she wasn't impressed with their plate.  Again, she actually prefers the more country style version at Egg Works.  I went safe with Eggs and Bacon and fortunately, they didn't mess that up. I don't recall what the third person got but I don't remember her being impressed.  The mimosas were tasty, but at their price point in relation to service quality, food quality, and interior space and design, I'd rather pay double for a better experience on The Strip.  I'm interested in seeing what type champagne they use.  Either way, you can make them yourself with your own quality bottle along with your choice of Sunkist, Tropicana or Minute Maid... OR, WAIT FOR IT... SIMPLY ORANGE!!!  Yeah, not impressed with this place.  You guys saved $30 from not honoring a semi-valid :) Groupon but lost an avid wannabe Elite Yelper for life!!!",

I was poking around on here looking for some breakfast, and thought this place sounded decent. Boy was I wrong! This place is freaking LEGIT! The food is so, so, SO YUMMY! I had the best corned beef hash I have ever had in my 24 years on this earth. The mimosas are really good too! You cannot go wrong with this restaurant. Do yourself a favor, and come get breakfast here. Trust me, you WILL NOT be disappointed. I have come here after dropping my pupper off at the vet several times, and have received the same great food and service each time.",

This place though..didn't have the mimosas yet. Now i know what you're thinking, \"how on earth did this girl enjoy brunch with no liquor?!\" But trust me..they got 5 stars for a reason!  The food!!! <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.My&s=0c1732f819bebed19223f1bdb3ae4f218cc84111fdd04da06fa1c675b8c240d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.My</a>. Goodness...is it legal to have biscuits that big? Like, what giant created those? Why is this pancake so dang good?! Why is my skillet this amazing?   Seriously, They'll have their liquor license soon, so they will be my PB&J. I want to see this business do good, my waitress was amazing! I forgot her name!! But I'll remember her face as i'm sure she will probably remember my party of 4. Such a sweetie, gave great suggestions and checked on us. This feels like a place where if you come enough, everyone will know your name. They were so good, that 5 days later, i ordered delivery! lol.",

Everyone can refill drinks which makes it impossible to ever have an empty glass or cup. The food was delicious from the Nutella French toast which is a mile high, to the homestyle potatoes with onions and peppers. At a time when food quality and customer service are questionable at most places, Mimosas was a wonderful surprise with great food, lots of it, and smiling, helpful staff. We'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for a great breakfast/brunch/lunch location.",

    "text": "Occupying the location formerly know as Pho Vietnam Grille Express off of Durango, behind Arby's, there's plenty to like on their menu. Always opting for sweeter options, my son and I split the churro waffle and nutella s'mores French toast. The former could have used more cinnamon and sugar, but was still a delicious waffle with a light and crispy texture and topped with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. The nutella s'mores French toast was pure sweetness overload. Three thick slices of egg soaked bread were coated in graham crackers with layers of nutella and marshmallows between each. It was so overwhelming that I could only finish a little more than half. A good concept, well executed dishes, and huge portions have turned me into a fan and most likely a repeat customer.",
