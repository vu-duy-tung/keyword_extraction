The staff is very friendly, nice and attentive on giving you a home service. The manager suggested the most delicious food and I can still taste flavors after a few days. They have delicious vegetarian and vegan food, also, they have gluten free options. Try the lamb shawarma wrap with the garlic instead of pita bread and add feta cheese, also, their chicken tikka masala and chicken chili is really good. The mango lassi and chai tea are one of my favorites.",

    "text": "I first walked in and was surprised that this is a self-serve place. I guess I just assumed an Indian Food place would include service. It makes more sense when you get to the menu/ordering area and see half of the menu is comprised of different kinds of burgers. I didn't discount them just for the fusion menu,  but it was my first point of concern. I was looking for some Korma specifically and they don't have that. So, as the pictures I'm gonna upload will show, I got the lamb Shawarma,  chicken samosa,  a mango lassi. My boyfriend got chicken boti, a drink and fries.   Our bill came out to $37 for me and my boyfriend which I think is ridiculous for a self-serve indian/American fusion diner (basically). They call your number and you go to pick up your food.  After you eat you throw away your trash and put your plates away. I don't mind going to self-serve places but the amount you pay for Indian food I think it's silly not to serve us. Especially because the place isn't busy! Why are there signs everywhere trying to get customers to serve themselves and clean up after themselves when it takes 30 seconds for an empty restaurant staff member to walk it over. I'll say right here if this restaurant doesn't succeed it's at least 50% because of their idea to make it self-serve.   I was happy with my lamb Shawarma. The  samosa was really spicy,  would not recommend. The lasse did not have the bubbly texture I'm used to. My boyfriend was pretty upset with his boti - only because for 11 dollars at a place you serve yourself he thought the portions were too small. He had like five chunks of chicken and bunch of rice and lettuce. They call it a salad but it really is just lettuce.   However, the lamb was good and I may be back for a lamb gyro if I'm in the mood one day. The food isn't bad just some execution issues I think. If you serve restaurant priced food, serve your customers. Especially if your portion sizes aren't commendable.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited this location over the weekend. The inside was quite nice, the decor was minimalistic & tasteful. I ordered a chicken gyro & my bf ordered the tandoori chicken. The food was very good, but the service was less than exceptional. We were not offered drinks upon arrival, our waiter just came over and asked us if we were ready to order. He took our order on a tablet, which apparently was an instantaneous system because he seemed very annoyed when I made a change to it. He came back after rushing off to cancel the previous mistake to finish taking the rest of our order. I asked for garlic naan, and he scoffed at the request, I'm assuming because we hadn't ordered a curry dish or anything like that which usually accompanies the naan. Anyway, he told US to remind HIM about the naan when he came back with our food... my boyfriend and I were kind of confused, it was as if he was making it a point that he would forget it? So he brings out the food and leaves.. Moments go by and we realize our naan wasn't coming out anytime soon so we ask another waitress about it. She is very nice and goes to get it right away. Our waiter comes out seemingly irritated and says \"I told you guys to remind me... I have 2-3 other tables...\" and some other stuff I couldn't understand. Literally we were the only people in there besides another couple that had walked in not too long ago. I was in complete awe. Also, the ice in our water was almost completely melted when we got them.. Needless to say we probably won't be coming back. It's a shame because the food was very good and it was a nice location..   P.s. Our receipt revealed that this wonderful staff member's name was Faheem. Thanks for your service Faheem, maybe next time try a little patience and kindness?",

If you plan on dining I recommend the chicken panini sandwich. Besides the food, they have the most enjoyable atmosphere yet. It was very zen. They also have very decent prices for full portioned meals. If you are looking for a place with lots a flavors and spice; Lazeez is the place to be!

The guy was very rude to my wife. My wife has a disease called Diverticulitis and cannot eat seeds. The beef Shawarma had seeds in it. The naan bread was burnt and had no garlic. My chicken chili with gravy was very small and the rice was even smaller. I went back to the place with the food not even touched to get my money back. I was cursed out by a woman employee at the register. They wanted me to talk to the manager about getting my money back basically wanting me to beg. I refused and they didn't give me my money back. My wife could die from those seeds in her food so if they are shut down by a lawsuit don't be surprised. This was the worst customer service I've ever had in Las Vegas do not I repeat do not go to this place",

I just bought my burger and went across the street to mcdonalds and picked up the dollar fries. Besides the price, the food is just ok. In no way shape or form is it worth 11 and 13, which is their general price range. If you go for kabobs you are talking very small quantities for nothing less than 12 and anything decent costing an easy 16. Also every little chutney, sauce or dip is going to cost you between 2- 3 dollars. Pros: Nice and Clean Cons: EXPENSIVE, Small quantities.   Final comment: I only come here when I dont want to go too far for halal. But Vegas is pretty small so I just drive most of the times :)",

I received a discount coupon for doing surveys online and found this place which was right down the street from where we lived and so my husband and I decided to go out for new restaurant experience. I ordered the chicken curry and my husband got the famous chicken masala dish. The chicken curry was superb with turmeric and other Indian spices. I had it at a level five spicy which you can choose between 1-10 on the spice level. It was perfect! The chicken masala was creamy and remanescent to buttered chicken and was so good. I really love this place. They even have a rewards program which is worth getting. We will definitely visit again and bring friends!!!",

The Bihari Kabab came with 2 Parathas, a salad, and raita. The Kabab was cooked to perfection, super soft and easy to eat. The Lazeez Burger, beef patty, was extremely filling and tasted great! It looked like perfection. The Goat Biryani had raita which paired extremely well with it! Chicken fingers and fries were crisp to perfection! The fries were a bit bigger and had a nice Masala on top! Lastly, the Falooda tasted great! it came as a drink and had Strawberry Ice Cream in it. It was great to have after this meal.

Ordered the butter chicken curry with garlic nan as well as a chicken and beef kabob that comes with salad and jasmine rice. From the seasoning to the consistency and flavor..Absolutely delicious! Had to dock a star because we waited almost an hour for our food and there was only 2 of us while people that came after us somehow got their food first. Nonetheless, if you love Mediterranean/Indian food and are in the Las Vegas area.. this place is a must try!",

    "text": "I watched as this restaurant opened after the previous restaurant closed and when I found out it was an Indian/Mediterranean one, I was anxious to give it a try.  I stopped in for a late dinner a few nights ago.  The meal was good.  I was surprised when I saw an Indian restaurant serving a beef curry stew but I realized the Northern Indian cuisine and the Middle Eastern might be the reason for this.  I ordered the Nihari which the menu describes as a ... \"traditional spicy beef curry, another royalty from India.\"  With it, I got an order of garlic naan and some iced tea. On a spiciness level of 1 to 10, I ordered 8.  After ordering, you take a seat and put one of the posts holding your number so they know which table to deliver the food.  While waiting, I got my iced tea from a separate room where the fountain drinks and iced tea were kept.  The wait was no that long and it gave me a chance to get some photos of the interior.  When the dinner came, it was on a school-like lunch tray.  The nihari was in an aluminum foil 'bowl' and the naan was on the side.  In addition, the curry came with some thinly sliced ginger and some jalapeno slices.  The utensils were plastic.  The nihari was very tasty and nicely spiced.  I did dump all the ginger and jalapeno into the stew and it certainly cleared my sinuses before I was finished.  The naan didn't have much of a garlic flavor, but it was fresh and hot and made a good soaker for some of the curry.  A couple of things come to mind when reviewing Lazeez.  I really dislike paying normal restaurant prices to eat as if I'm in a school cafeteria.  Plastic utensils, get your own drinks, aluminum foil bowls--these are all the things that detracted from what was some good food.  If I were to return, it would be for takeout.  At least I'd have proper utensils.    A couple of other things.  I asked what came with the meal and the person at the register said just rice.  There was never any rice.  The online menu shows the dish with naan.  I was charged for naan.  Maybe that was an additional charge because of the garlic naan.    The restaurant is strange.  When you walk in, you have a choice of two ways to go--one through the beverage area which looks like it may be bar seating in the future or you can go to your left and past some tables to get into the place.  Walking straight ahead will take you into a divider which is an odd setup.  There are two distinct eating areas and they're completely different.  I can't figure out who designed the interior but I might have been able to do better.  I'm not sure how much the previous place figures in its current design but it is odd.  Altogether it was good food which was detracted by the way it's served especially that damned, little plastic spoon.  Oh, and spend a little extra and get some decent napkins instead of giving a customer 5 of thin small diner ones.",

We got the beef briyani, chicken tikka masala, veggie samosas, and naan bread. The food was okay - not on par with food from other places with tried before, but we really liked the veggie samosas.. They were big, filled with veggies, and crispy! They were so good with the green and red sauces they come with.  For delivery it was an extra $10 charge and took about an hour, which we didn't mind because we were THAT lazy in the heat. It was good to have the option, especially to come to a busy area of the strip!",

We ordered chicken biryani and beef bihari platter and the taste was superb. Everything was cooked to perfection and had a genuine Pakistani taste. The owner personally took our order and ensured that the spice level is tailored to our preference. The paratha and the garlic naan was freshly baked and made a great combination with the beef bihari. The portion size was great for the price as well. Highly recommended. Really wish we had something similar in east coast. Can totally take a trip to Vegas to just eat here!",

I wanted to try the Tandoori chicken so I opted to get it ala cart instead of the meal. (5.00) and ordered a side of Baba Ganoush. She said that it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the order was still not ready. I was one of two people in the restaurant. The other person that was their asked about his order as well and she said that we ordered the same thing and it takes a little longer as it is made to order - so I decided to order a chi tea and wait it out. 40 minutes and finally got my order. What a waste of money. The baba ganoush was extremely bitter and chunky. No spice to it at all. The piece had maybe a 2 bites that were edible.",

We ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala, Goat Biryani, Goat Curry, all excellent & spiced to order. The Buttered Naan was noteworthy because it was fresh but not too doughy. Priced reasonably for the quality, the restaurant setting was charming & clean. The table next to us ordered the Lazeez Beef Burger, and told us that's their favorite (they frequent this restaurant).

Nigari was very salty, but not as bad as the Paneer Saag. It was so salty, bitter, and fiborus (should be creamy, right?) so it was simply inedible. Chicken Tikka tasted OK, but it was the size of two cornish hen legs. Garlic Naan, not garlicky.Worst Indian food I ever had....Not impressed!",

Instead lamb shawarma wrap fantabu-marvelistically deliciousrama excellent!!!  Firmly recommended.  Of course its spicyy ttsssss... Falafels are okay a tad on the dry side; ordered with tzatziki sauce which helped.  Except the tzatziki was watered down in appearance and texture.   Baba ganoush with pita is great.  I put some BG in my shawarma to make an unforgettable yep!  Ma il mio bel ama il cibo cinese.  Next time my sweetheart. When in doubt, always get baklava.  Only sweet tooths understand this dilemma.  There is no counseling for being a sweet tooth except for silent therapy with sweets.  A lost star in rating though since I weigh on customer service.  At the time of using the Yelp Eat 24 method I had even tipped in advance.  When I picked up my food, I stood waiting cuz I thought I had to sign the receipt.  But only after I asked I learned it's prepaid. I can just take my bag and go.  Users of Yelp Eat 24 get an itemized email which serves as the receipt.  I trusted my order was prepared correctly and I'd forgotten to check the bag before I left.  I get home gladly to see order is correct and still hot.  But no napkins...  For the fact that they serve Indian and Mediterranean cuisines, I'll still order from them, but in person.",

Chilli Chicken was flavorful and the chicken cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The Paneer tikka Masala were better than most restaurants. I loved the Samosas and the Garlic naan, the naan were crispy, fresh and thin.  I have to say that most people would love the level of spice in these dishes.  I do prefer my food on the hot side, and I could stand for more spiciness.  The waitress was very attentive.

    "text": "Lazeez just catered our weekly work lunch and I have to say that it was awesome.  We typically try and get these types of food catered because of the large vegetarian and vegan employees and Lazeez really hits it out of the park with these types of dishes. Their meat containing dishes are awesome too. I grew up a typical meat-and-potatoes American, and things like Indian food was unheard of. I am so glad that places like this exist because it allows those of us that did not grow up exposed to these foods to try them. Lazeez does this food very  well. I would say they're probably the best place of their kind in Las Vegas.",

Upon entering you have a choice to dine in the lunch buffet area or the regular dining room. The food was delicious and my favorite dish was the Chili Chicken.  We were a little bummed they didn't have saag or goat curry as part of the offerings but we were able to order from the menu a la carte.  We also tried the lassi but it came out too icy and watery. Overall, the food was not bad for $12.99 and the service was great.",

This restaurant is my favorite for a quick go to Indian bite and if my kid isn't down for Indian they have some goodies for her too.   So options are great here but the flavors and the foods they give are delish. The staff I love them. I love talking to this one waiter about Bollywood films and actors.    That being said the atmosphere, the pricing it's all great for me. They were closed tonight so I went else where to Mint Indian and I was so disappointed after being used to the flavors of this place.   Great food.  Great staff. Great selection. I wish more people ate here because after reading reviews of other places I'm a bit baffled.  Even my Indian friends don't understand why Lazeez Doesn't have more of a following ... you gotta try this place. I do recommend it.   They do not over cook their meats so when I do want to have a flesh of an animal it's nice to not have to fight the dead meat just chew it.",

I've tried a few other Indian cuisine's around town and they didn't hold up to these standards.  I alway's want to try something new...but tend to get the exact same thing everytime...Shrimp Tikka Masala n Garlic Naan... so im gonna have to come back for the all you can eat buffet to try other items now.

I hadn't had lunch, so I thought I'd try this place, I actually haven't had Indian food since I moved here 6 months ago. Talk about a silver lining to my 2week headache with Vons. The service was great, genuinely nice people! The restaurant was nice. They even had a separate room for people with kids. I think that's nice, the parents didn't have to correct their kids for running around, there was space for them to move from one side to the other without bumping into neighboring tables. And they could be a little louder. Nice for them and for me. But I'm stuffed. I should have stopped eating sooner but the food was so good, and met a longtime craving. I had butter chicken with garlic naan. It was great. So tasty. Plus I found out they deliver up to 11 miles. I already checked, and I live 9 miles away, so that's awesome for me! I spied on other people's plates and it all looked tempting, plus the other customers were also raving about their meals.  One customer came for pick up anf said yhey come from East LV just for this place!",

Found Lazeez  on the internet and was interested to investigate the Indian / Mediterranean angle.  The restaurant was lovely and clean and the staff very friendly and welcoming.  I opted for the chicken vindaloo with rice and garlic naan and it hit the spot perfectly.  Perfectly cooked and very tasty.  Even though I didn't opt for the buffet it looked very good, with an excellent range of dishes.  It's the first time I have ever seen a menu that has a full range of Indian food together with my favourite Mediterranean dishes like falafel and Shawarma (well and truly spoilt for choice).  It certainly doesn't take on the look of the traditional Indian restaurants that I'm used to, but will I be going back?  You bet your a** I will!  Save me a table!!",

Chicken tikka masala with side of rice: I really liked the tender chicken and the sauce which was delicious and creamy. I ordered it 5 out of 10 with spiciness level. I wish I ordered it spicier.   Gulab jamun: the syrup was too sweet and watery. The texture is off, I didn't like it.  The place is spacious but only a couple of tables were occupied when I picked up my order. Decor is confusing, not Indian nor Mediterranean motif. At the cashier area, they have moldy desserts in the display case which was disgusting.",

Nice selection including Tandoori chicken, chili chicken, chicken curry (which was mild so I didn't mind the curry), chicken makhani aka butter chicken (which was my fave!), aloo saag which is potatoes & spinach, okra, vegetable samosas (potato & pea filling), rice, lettuce salad, sauces like tzatziki & rice pudding for dessert. They will bring you a huge serving of plain or garlic naan which was delicious! I started with just a spoonful of each item to try it & that pretty much filled me up. I did go back for extra makhani sauce to scoop up with my naan (which I wasn't about to waste!) & a second little bowl of rice pudding (w/pistachio bits on top) which I was skeptical of at first but it totally grew on me! The only thing I missed was hummus but they probably mix the menu up on different days. If I was headed home I would have ordered an order for later. I bet it's good! Place was nicely decorated, clean & the service was wonderful. I was by myself & didn't feel awkward or anything. There was at least one other solo diner & about half of the customers looked of Indian decent so that's probably a good sign as well. I'm happy I've broadened my tastes!",

It came with the most amazingly falafel. The pita bread was warm and yummy. They basically make you buy more pita bread though bc it barely comes with any to begin with. For 1.50 more you get a serving double the size of what it comes with. Not a bad price, but the appetizer was already $11. Regardless, we ordered Mediterranean salads with chicken added. By far one of the best I had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, and was cooked to perfection.  The dressing was a mix of tzatziki and jalapeno, which was spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy (I can handle spice). Overall the food was outstanding.  We took a look at the lunch buffet. We came near the end so everything had been out for awhile and it looked that way. No hummus, pita bread or much of a selection of veggies. We skipped on that but possibly would have tried had we come earlier. There was still a nice selection on different dishes to try nonetheless.   We will be back for sure:)",

The behari kabab used to be succulent and juicy but they were extremely dry the last 2 times I've gotten them. My previous review was 5 stars because the food used to be of very high quality but they aren't even getting my order (which has never changed) right anymore. My old post is proof that I don't only post negative reviews and that I've been loyal.  On that note, the service has gotten really ridiculous. The wait times are astonishing and the staff is incredibly rude. I've gone to lazeez 20 some times and have ordered all my dishes a la carte. This time around, I called to place my regular order and the girl on the phone told me they don't do the curries a la carte. I replied that that's odd because I've both ordered out and dined in there several times and I've always gotten it a la carte with no issues. She had a very rude tone and basically snapped at me, saying that if I got it that one time (even though I specifically told her I've gotten it several times) it was probably out of the kindness of the owner's heart. I have gotten it this way SEVERAL times and my order has been taken by multiple people. She was extremely condescending.  Furthermore, last visit my mom commented that the raita seeming like less than before and the lady was ridiculously defensive, my mom didn't even use a rude tone, simply surprised. When you pay for raita you want to get a decent amount. So much for the customer always being right.",

    "text": "Lazeez was such a surprise hit! We were in the area and craving Indian food (as is the case with me like 90% of the time) and decided to check this place out. HOLY CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA BATMAN! It was SO good! We ordered the saag chicken and the Bihari kabob roll. Both were excellent. The best part was the saag chicken came with parantha. You need to understand that growing up, getting parantha was a big deal. It was usually only on Sunday morning and mom fed you parantha and then you didn't eat again until dinner. Yes, it's heavy, but it's heavenly too. The ones we got were yummy and flaky and brought back so much nostalgia for me. The serving portions were huge and we had plenty to take home. It was just as yummy the next day reheated. Lazeez (the Indian food part of it) is definitely authentic and maybe not the best for new palates to Indian food. This is definitely for people who LOVE them some Indian food. The dishes are not generic \"Indian restaurant\" food and not for the faint of heart. The weekend lunch buffet is back as well. It's until 3PM on the weekends. I will 100% be frequenting it. If you see me in line, say hi. I apologize now for having food in my mouth when I wave back!",

    "text": "When I go to an ethnic restaurant, I want to see myself surrounded by people OF that ethnicity. That's a sign of how good the food is. So, when I see Indian families crowding in, I know that this place is doing something right.I may be on the pale side, but I know when things are done right.   We were met by a young lady who was very attentive and couldn't have made us more comfortable. The service timing was right on the button, as well.  We had generous and well-done plates of Goat Biryani and Chicken Makhini. For starters, the Falafels were packed with fresh herbs and spices. The Tzatziki wasn't a cream, but a tangy liquid. It soaked into the Falafels and made them little time bombs of bombastic flavor. The Veggie Samosa's were done with a nice, buttery flake and you just knew the peas weren't from a can. The generous plate of Goat Biryani had just enough funk & the Chicken Makhini had just enough fire.   For desert, the Suji Halwa was as decadent as you can get without copious amounts of chocolate. It is a Semolina dish that was infused with a ton of spices, raisins, rose water, topped with pistachios and lightly toasted almonds. I'll go back just for this.  The delicate use of spices, the depth of flavor, the layering of good ingredients make this a place to savor at least once. And hand made Naan bread? Who makes hand made Naan bread? And Mango Lassi done right (no ice, for one). There wasn't a down note to the whole meal. And of course we took it home. The Makhini was twice as hot from sitting (take note).  I will definitely go back.",

    "text": "Came here with my pops today for lunch. We were supposed to go to Mint Leaf Bistro, but we ended up here on accident.   As soon as we walked in around 1 pm, there was literally no one in the restaurant. We were hesitant on whether we should stay or go. I gave them a quick search on yelp, saw their 4 star rating, and decided to give them a shot. Their food looked pretty good from the pictures as well so why not.   We each ordered the chicken curry lunch special (spicy level 6 for my dad and spicy level 8 for me on a scale of 4-10) and split a chicken tandoori and garlic naan. The chicken curry was super flavorful, and the chicken was really juicy and tender. The chicken tandoori was also a hit, and the garlic naan was soft and fluffy. The curry could have been spicier so I'll go with level 10 next time. The lunch specials also include rice and your choice of soda.  The only complaint I have is that the pre-set silverware was dirty (had some kind of food smear on them). I tried to replace them with the ones on the tables next to us, but they were also dirty. I hope they do a better job of washing and polishing their silverware.   Oh and for real though, I straight up had some of the worst gas for a good 4 hours after this meal. I don't know what they put in that curry, but it's some potent stuff.   All in all, it was a pleasant experience, and the food was a lot better than I expected. I'll definitely be back for that chicken curry and to try other items on their menu.",

The worker who helped me along with another worker who completed my payment were not super friendly or talkative.. maybe they're not used to walk in orders.  I ended up ordering the falafel wrap with fries. The portion size was huge which I always love, but the falafel itself was just alright to me. I felt like it needed to be a bit spicer or maybe just a bit more spice in general. I also would have liked more sauce since there was barely any.

That was not the case for us. In fact, one rice dish we ordered was the lowest spice level of 4 and it was much much too spicy for us and we LOVE spicy food. The owner was very kind and removed the dish from our bill since we could not eat it. I just saw another review and I do agree that the falafels were a bit too dry. I like mine a little more moist.

(oh FYI  try there red house sauce... its bomb!) .... me and my friend kept chatting away and she let us try their chai tea.... which love chai tea not that bootleg kind from starbucks.... definitely will come back and try the other dishes...",

This is my first yelp review and it due to the food at Lazeez, it deserves to be my first post.   $40 for bland microwaved food. The food was so hot it was not edible for a good while. The chicken tikka had no spice, but was loaded with cream and tomato sauce. I honestly thought I was eating a vodka sauce. I very well could have been eating a microwaved vodka sauce.   If I wasn't so hungry, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, even though I still threw away 3 plates of food(which I feel terrible about).Waste is waste, but save your money. The staff was very nice, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not to make friends.",

Probably explains why the restaurant was empty when I went there.  To me it seems like the portions have been reduced by a third.  I got suspicious when they served the food in different containers then they made up some excuse that they ran out of the regular containers. If you are on a diet or looking to reduce your calorie intake I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I got the veggie burger and onion rings, the veggie burger seemed like it was house made fresh and very tasty. They even brought out ketchup and ranch for my onion rings without me having to ask. The onion rings did not taste frozen. My husband got a falafel wrap and we both loved it. We also got the baklava but were to full to eat it. But it looks good! :P Overall this place is solid and I would recommend it to anyone.",

(5years) from the last time I remembered it I really enjoyed it and I remember the bread (naan?) was pretty crispy. Anyways this place is really good! The bread is definitely not crispy..but still good! I had chicken samosas, chicken tikka masala, and binyani raita. I loved the tikka masala of course.. because it isn't spicy!! I am unfortunately not in the club for spicy-Ness. It is pretty creamy and it comes with a side of rice! My second fav was the chicken samosas! Some pink sauce is sweet and the green sauce is...green hahaha i can't explain the taste but definitely worth trying! And the last one was the biryani with raita. This one is the some what spicy one. Keep in mind that I don't like spicy food so this might not even be spicy for someone who loves it. The bread (naan) is kind of chewy bread? Still really good! Everyone go try it once!..you might just like it (=  I ordered on the phone for pick up btw.. and the girl asked me the spicy-Ness level for the biryani and I said 0.. she laughed and said the lowest we have is level 4.. hahahhaha! Kind of pricy btw.. but portions are big!",

Best I've ever had at an Indian buffet... actually, better than a LOT of places.  But their Indian food is very bleah. Whyy  Samosas sucked. Greasy. Too moist. No flavored rice. Just regular white rice.  Price-wise, it's 2-3 dollars more than many Indian buffets in California that are much better quality. And i don't even consider them all that great. They're enough to go regularly without financial guilt. But this one is worse than them on both fronts, so I can't even come here as a \"let's just get a meal, and make it indian\" chipotle is too good and cheap, same with input. Even many burrito places. The lunch buffet here is double the price and tastes worse than those other half price options.  From my gut feeling, if I were to come here again, I'd be really pushing myself to, both in terms of the taste and my wallet.  Everything else is fine, if not better them average. Decor, service, etc. This place could easily be a 4 if their food just simply tasted better.",

The chicken was probably the best I've had on an Indian buffet here in Vegas. The food options were a bit limited though. Some of the trays were not really full and it took a while for them to fill it up (if they ever did). I guess they were waiting on more people to show up. I appreciate the fresh, hot food but wish they'd cater a bit more to the patrons that are already there. I think it would be pretty awesome if they actually added on some Mediterranean food in the buffet along with the Indian food. Would I go back? Yes for a change up but I'd probably go to my regular Indian buffet before here.",

Still we thought to give a chance for food so next day we reached by 6 pm. Ordered one appetizer Chana chat . And trust me we felt like we made a good decision by stepping down second time. It was very tasty.. still have that tangy, sweet taste while even writing ...lol  Then we moved for the dinner menu and asked for veg biryani with high hopes. But turned out completely opposite. It was just like pulao and the waitress did not even care to give us a plate for biryani though the restaurant was not running busy at all because we were very early.  They just don't attend the customers properly.  Will never go back to this place though they might have some other good dishes..",

Interesting menu, a mix of Middle-eastern and Sub-continent cuisine. Looking at the menu, I most certainly was confused, I could not figure out what kind of cuisine I should have - Middle-Eastern - Indian - Pakistani - North African  I finally made my choice of Samosa and Chan Chat - I as they seemed to be safe bets   The Samosa is no way close to an Indian samosa, its good but I expected an Indian Samosa, The chana chat, was something weird. I have never tasted this kinda of chana flavor or presentation. Maybe a middle-eastern style. I am not a expert of that cuisine, so will not comment.  Overall its a interesting place, will surely try it again only with middle-eastern cuisines expert/s to truly understand what they are offering here.",

Food-We ordered tandoori chicken, it was undercooked, bland and we ordered the beef kababs and chicken tikka masala these two tasted like it was microwaved and half cooked which made  our stomach bad.Service was too slow which the servers  are supposed to be active.I would say it wasn't  worth it eating there.I personally  wouldn't  recommend this place.And at the end when we paid, the lady who served us said to tip her cash because  the credit card tips goes to the owner.So I would say who is trying to eat here, get cash for tips. We never had this bad experience before.",

It might be too spicy for some, but I really enjoyed the spice level on it. It also comes with a yogurt sauce for that reason but I cannot have dairy. It was still a delicious dish without it. It was a bit pricy but definitely worth it. The portions are a good size and the food is authentic. I can't wait to try out more dishes from here!",

When the hostess brought the food she only brought the curry, and I had to ask for rice, also she brought the food in a metal container and not on a plate. It tasted like there was no spices or curry added. The restaurant was empty and the cashier kept going in the back, so it seemed like a ghost town. I had to ask and get my own water. The whole layout is horrible. I don't know who designed the place but it actually makes your eyes hurt. I really don't think they will be around very long.",

    "text": "I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment.   The food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).  For my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to.   Another suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like \"I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.\"  I'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed.",

    "text": "The food of Lazeez for me and my family is the perfect fusion of flavors. Best of both east and west. I am devoted halal eating individual, so is my family. So for us finding the right place to have the quaint essential american burger but in a halal form was a challenge since we moved to Vegas. But I have to say that Lazeez's special Lazeez beef burger hit the spot for us. It has all the components of a delicious burger; juicy, moist, meaty and fresh. It also have hints of spices that gives it a eastern flair which is amazing. Their portion size is also very reasonable. The burgers come with steak fries and overall it was very filling. However the price is a little on the expensive side but that is understandable since they are offering halal meat and chicken. We still have not tried their other dishes, but we definitely would be going back for some more.  It's decor is also something I have to write about. It has such an unique up scale diner like feel with Mediterranean touches like light fixtures and etc. It is always clean and the red and white color scheme adds a nice brightness to the restaurant which I think adds to the dining experience. So Overall Lazeez was a great experience.  I  made a yelp account to just write how great this place is and for me it being halal is the most amazing aspect. Thank you from all the halal food seeking individuals out there, you fulfilled our craving. :) keep up the good work and just a suggestion if you could possibly bring more Americans but halal dishes to the menu then it would be great ;)",

The falafel was a nice size & texture was amazing. Possibly the best falafel in Vegas. Samosas were just the right size & absolutely delicious. Curry & masala were perfect.   This was my picky sons intro to Indian food. He ate 1 falafel, 2 samosas & the whole bowl of chicken curry with rice (15 y/o) & actually was full so portion size is perfect.

I got the pakoras which were really good and I liked the chutneys that came with them. The chicken tikka masala and chicken makhani were both really good. I ordered them mild cause I was hoping my toddler would eat some but it was too spicy for him. I preferred the flavor of the chicken tikka masala and liked that it was white meat, however the chicken makhani was the best I've had in town and the dark meat was really tender. It came with rice which I didn't know so I also ordered a side of rice. The garlic naan was good too and would definitely order that again. I got it delivered from a site called online restaurants which I accessed through their website because I was out of the range for GrubHub and Postmates.",

The salad and rice that accompanied this dish was perfect! I highly recommend this entree. The atmosphere is calming and the service is prompt and courteous.",

We typically do not do this to restaurants but we were so hungry!!  The staff was very friendly; she greeted us and seated us immediately; waters came out within my 1-2minute mark. She was very charismatic and personable. We glanced at the menu and it was definitely a great selection.   The restaurant itself is nicely decorated; it was very clean and bright. The restrooms were also well taken care of.   We ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken tindoori, rice biryani and nihari. The food came out fairly fast. I was worried that the food would not be as good due it being almost closing time. However, to my surprise everything was delicious.  We ordered 4 things that was enough to share among our group.   The flavors were both aromatic and addicting. Portions were perfect for our group as well. The tikka masala was creamy and had a flavorful punch. Chicken tandoori we all basically fought for.   My friends were mainly all from out of town. One is enjoys indian food and is familiar with the spices of the cuisine. He mentioned that this has to be one of the best indian food places he has been to.   We exchanged friendly conversation with the lady at the end and paid our bill. She didn't rush it at all despite closing time.   I know that I will be back to Lazeez to continue to try their other entrees. They also have buffet lunches during the week day! Maybe I'll indulge in that as well.",

He said he would call me back.  When he called back he said he would only replace the kabobs, stating that I did not specify gluten free on that item.  I told him the menu said it was gluten free.  He told me that I did not specify so he won't replace it. I again stated that the menu says gluten free I shouldn't have to specify. He argued with me.

I would say that the interior is not cohesive, and did not work too well for the setting.  Looking at the menu, it was definitely a little bit all over the place--there were Indian dishes, Greek dishes, salads, burgers... It was a little overwhelming. I do commend them for having vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. I always think it's important for restaurants to acknowledge these, because there are so many people with allergies and/or dietary restrictions.  Let's get right to the food--I wanted to try their veggie burger, because it was described as a popular Indian street food. This menu item was good! And it was probably my favorite out of everything I had ordered. It was at a good price, and a perfect handheld \"on-the-go\" type of food.  Another dish I tried was their paneer tikka masala, which is my favorite Indian dish, and one that I have ordered at numerous restaurants. Unfortunately, I found theirs to taste very different from the ones I've had and did not enjoy it very much. The samosas were decent! I liked the texture. I also had some naan at this restaurant and those were alright as well.  I've driven by the place numerous times and always think about coming back to try something else, but I just never got around to it and kept finding reasons not to. So, for now, this is it! If you're there, try it out!",

    "text": "If you've had a taste of authentic Indian food and Mediterranean food this spot will do no justice for your taste buds!   I came here with my family for a late lunch. We were the only customers here. One young lady was serving us and did a decent job. She made sure she greeted us, promptly sat us down and took our drink order. She needed a reminder to refill our empty drinks but hey that happens.   Anyways back to the food; it was like anticipating a Coca Cola but getting a flat store brand soda. That's the best analogy at the moment. You can't offer Indian and Mediterranean food and have it lack flavor. Of course I order the chicken tikka masala and it was almost like I could've made it better. Mind you, I hardly cook. I am willing to give it another shot dothe road since I do know they recently opened and I know this specific spot had had multiple unsuccessful restaurant. This restaurant could have a lot of potential. They could start by add serving their chicken bryani and chicken tikka masala with a serving spoon. It was a family size portion. We had to use the same forks and spoons from our meal. Also, I order a Tzatziki on the side because the waitress informed me it didn't come with the sampler. Of course it did though, as stated on the menu. So we had two but I mean the more Tzatziki the better but that's not the point. Regardless we paid $110 for our late lunch. It was nice to try but I would need my fellow yelpers to keep me updated before I ever stop by again. I'll definitely try the \"Mediterranean\" side of the menu.   I asked my family what they rated their meal so check out the pictures!   1st star for serving Halal 2nd star for the over tasty Chicken Tikka Tandoori 3rd star cleanliness and average service",

Chicken samosas were tasty especially with the sweet red sauce, they reminded me a little of chicken nuggets. Chicken tikka was disappointing. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the actual sauce was nothing special. Paneer was cut in really tiny cubes and had more sauce than actual cheese. Overall a bit expensive for being average Indian food, but they give pretty decent sized portions. Entrees also came with free rice. The inside is decorated really nice and the cashier was friendly. Probably wont be back as theres so many other Indian places in town.",

This place is quality food in a take out/fast food style. You order with the cashier and pay. Then the food is delivered to your table in disposable containers. When you're done, you throw away your trash and out your tray away. Easy peezy.   We ordered a chicken tikka masala (of course.. our main go-to for Indian). But instead if ordering one each, we shared it and also ordered a Paneer chili and garlic naan. The paneer chili was good, with onions and peppers, but I'm sorry, the tikka masala just can't be beat. Esp with the garlic naan to compliment it!   The prices are more than fair. Only downfall is their service is a bit slow. I remember thinking we waited a long time for our food. Which I don't mind if I'm not in a hurry. Since that first time, we have also ordered it again about 3 days later for take out. And now that I've talked about it, I kind if feel like it again.. Maybe for tonight!  Go try it for yourself. I loved it..",

I ordered a goat curry dish which was rather pricey but was hopeful it would be just as great as everything else.  I got my dish and noticed small bone fragments.  I kept pulling the sharp pieces from my curry and asked the waiter if this is how it should be.  He was unsure because it was his first day. Another member of the waitstaff checked with the chef and confirmed it should have bones in it. I asked for a replacement because there were just way too many for my comfort/saftey and showed the many many pieces to the waitress. As if someone took a hammer and whacked the bone.  The experienced waitress told me that they would not replace my dish because I already touched it with my fingers.  She said I was the first person to complain and that is how all their curries come. I have eaten curry there and many other places and never experienced this once. When asked she couldn't even tell me how i was supposed to eat this dish safely.  She returned from the kitchen and advised that they would replace the dish this time. I have never been made to feel as if I was the absurd person until last night.  My meal replaced with a chicken curry and surprise NO BONES . I say surprise because they had just finished telling me that ALL their curries have bones. I was charged for the goat curry that i did not get to eat even though my replacement was 2.00 cheaper. I was done arguing and just wanted to hurry out of there.  I paid the tab with tip turning it into a bill over 82.00 because the new waiter didnt deserve to be jipped. This experience will keep me from frequenting the establishment.",

We tried 8 first time but quite hot enough for our palate. We also asked for a side of fresh raw chili and onions which complemented our meal. We tried aloo saag, chicken curry, nihari, chicken gyro, tandoori roti and paratha. All fabulous. One suggestion to owners is to add lamb gosht and a beef curry would be fabulous.

I walked in with zero expectations, what can one expect from an Indian place tucked away in a quiet Las Vegas suburb? Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. This is not your quintessential Indian restaurant, it serves Indian/Mediterranean food, so you expect some kind of fusion food. I was suffering from an upset tummy that day and so decided to play it safe and ordered the dal soup with some rice. The dal and rice combination was so uplifting that I started feeling better almost instantly. I started trying other dishes that our group ordered including the chicken biryani. It is not an authentic biryani from any angle but tasted amazing. We also tried the sheekh kebab, boti kebab and palak chicken. Every dish was great and looked as if it was crafted with great care. The service was slow though the restaurant was empty.",

My husband and I each ordered the chicken masala and we had enough left over for dinner as well.  We were thinking of ordering the chicken curry instead with white meat, but decided on the masala.  A very nice woman (who I'm assuming was the owner) sent over a small plate of the curry at no charge so we could taste it.  The service is excellent, the food is excellent and the location is perfect as it's five min. away from our house.  We will definitely be back very soon!",

This place serves up lots of flavor, fresh spices and ingredients, I ordered a chicken curry dish to go it had large delicious beautifully cooked tender chunks of chicken breast and fresh veggies I ate it for lunch and then dinner it was that much!  I ordered it a 6 and it was just right. I see that other reviewers commented on the prices and gave them less stars, it takes money and effort to deliver a freshly made quality meal and I appreciate that some people are still out there trying to do just that so I'll pay a tad more for that any day, the entree was so big I ran out of rice (so ask for extra rice for your next meal) one of their entrees can feed two people so long as one of them is not Fat Bastard! By the way this place is spotlessly clean! Keep up the good work- I will be back tomorrow.",

The service is terrible and I had to wait about 2 minutes before I was acknowledged at the door even though the place was mostly empty.

I also want to point out that I've been waiting for about 20 minutes and they managed to bring out my naan and rice, but no chicken Tikka. I asked one of the wait staff why would they bring my rice before the chicken and she told me her collegue gave my order to another table so they have to remake everything. So now I'm sitting here with cold naan and cold rice. Still  no main course. Nice right? Will never come here again.",

I read some of the bad reviews and have to say its unfortunate but I understand you can please all the people some of the time, or some of the people all of the time but you cannot please all of the people all of the time.  For me - I am crazy about Aloo Matter.  Lazees has a very unique recipe that is nothing like any Aloo Matter I have ever had.  Even in Delhi where I work on occasion, it is not this good.  Seriously.  The Naan is addictive - beware.  Once you taste it, you are ruined for life, it is that good.  Other Naan will simply not live up to it.  Even though I do not eat much meat, I like the Chicken Tikka Masala (honestly, I only eat the sauce over rice and give the chicken to my daughter).  I would say it is a standard recipe - quite good, but I think its similar at other restaurants (still - that is a good thing).  The only complaint I have is the falafel was simply not good.  It was dry and lacked taste.  Could be they baked it?  I don't know but I have become accustomed to the falafel from the Halal carts in NYC (another addiction of mine) and Lazeez falafel simple does not measure up.  Otherwise, definitely add this restaurant to your must try list.",

We came here based on the good ratings in Yelp aand wanted to try the Buffet. First of all, the buffet was very limited, with only Chicken items from meat. I was expecting to find atleast lamb or goat. Nevertheless, the chicken items all tasted the same. Food color was too much. There were dahl, veggie korma, pakora. They were average. The rice was simple plain rice. Did not expect. The naans were okay. And they only had 1 desert. That's it!!! I have eaten indian buffet in many states and this one goes to the bottom of the list. Service was okay. We were so upset with the food that we finished our food within minutes. 2 of our group members have only tried 2 things from thw buffet. I would not recommend the place.",

There was no appetizer, no freshly made bread, the salad (if it can be called that) was a joke, just two Veg entrees both of which was pathetic. The Aloo Channa was tasted as if the chef started doing a Sambhar but changed his mind midway and made a mess eventually. As if this much Chickpea wasnt enough, the chat was also Chickpea. The eggplant curry was ok at best.  And over on top of it, this one was called the 'Eid buffet' with no Biryani ! It was also ridiculously priced at $14.99 plus taxes.",

    "text": "Surprisingly upscale interior and a relatively traditional menu- apps, wraps, plates, and even Halal desserts round out the menu here, featuring currys and other Indian specialties on weekends. They also have several vegetarian and vegan options.  Interior is very nice- in fact, that walk-up counter is kind of odd (and there are two of them?). Not sure why that layout was chosen over offering table service. Pricing is fair on most items, but some need to come down: $8-10 for a wrap without a side is a little steep considering the fast-casual setup they chose to implement. But they have adjusted their pricing on some items, like doubling the (originally) 2-piece falafel app to 4 pieces for the same $5 price tag. But for $10/wrap, there should be a side.  Falafel is good here- but falafel wrap is dry, highly suggest adding hummus or babaghanouj for moisture and added flavor. Unfortunately the drizzle of tzatziki sauce doesn't quite cut it.  Veggie samosa was tasty- sided with the red Lazeez's sauce is a surprisingly balanced combo, the fruit-based sauce balances out the heat of the filling. But I don't understand why 1 smallish veggie samosa is $2.50 while an order of 4 chicken samosas is $5.  Tip to management: even if you don't offer table service, do away with the red plastic baskets for serving your meals, they're cheap-looking. Invest in real dishes and silverware. And remove the \"Bus your own tables!\" note above the trash, it's tacky.",

The food was awesomely delicious - especially Biryani with Raita and Chicken Curry. Also, the food portion is good and the price is reasonable. The delivery was made on time, which is very important to us.   The staff was friendly and helpful when I was placing an order.

I didn't realized they have 2 different kinds of raita so if you're like me and love that stuff, make sure you get the right one! Again, not their fault. I ordered delivery and it came in the time they said it would so points for that also! I'll definitely be ordering again :)",

He hangs up and a few minutes later he pulls up and says \"this place is f**king confusing.\" Gave me my bags of food and turned back to his car. No, 'hey sorry about the mix up' or any kind of apology just another \"F**K!\" as he got into his car, I'm guessing because his phone started ringing? The food was cold, horrible customer service and over an hour and a half for food so I called the manager to explain the situation. She asked what would I like to do and I asked for a refund. She said that would not be a problem. I spoke to the Eat24 rep she said she was unable to start the refund because the manager told her she didn't have time to talk to her or give her permission for the refund and to call back tomorrow. Food was subpar, customer service was horrendous and communication was garbage. Will never eat here or order from here again and will tell everyone I know to stay FAR away from this place...",

There was absolutely NO flavor- like literally tasted like nothing- and the chicken had a gooey and extra chewy texture; no one touched the order.

Not being familiar with their menu it took awhile to work through the descriptions. The food was good overall. They offered 'hotness' from 4-10 depending on your preference for the chicken curry. We asked for 4. We are used to spicy food and didn't think it would be too hot for our taste. When we tasted the dishes it appeared they offered the choice but it came the way it was prepared - too hot, too spicy, more like an 8+. I asked for chutney which they did not offer, nor did they offer yoghurt to cool it down. I got a chili sauce which did nothing to reduce the heat. Honestly, the prices are a bit high. $12 for spinach is not in line w/what it is. We might try a lunch special another time but wasn't too pleased with this experience & most likely another 'one & done'!",

    "text": "We got ours to go. The food was salty and nothing special. The goat curry which was a \"must try\" on the menu had three small pieces of goat meat and nothing else. For the price, the portion was also really small. It came with a small styrofoam bowl of jasmine rice. The other two orders were nothing special and overpriced for what we got. There were no napkins or plasticware in the bag either. The service was nonchalant to cold from the two people who helped us. There are better middle eastern places than this.",

I had planned on taking my food home but wanted to try a quick bite when I got into the car... well, I ate the whole thing in the parking lot (I'm not proud). It was so tasty! My birthday is next week and now I know where my husband will be taking me for dinner :)",
