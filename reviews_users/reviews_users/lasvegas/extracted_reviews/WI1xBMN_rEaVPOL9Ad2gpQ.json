The pork belly appetizer was bland. The bone in rib eye was really dry and had no taste. Onion rings were cool. I don't remember if they had a bread basket. If they did, it certainly was forgettable. Overall, I would pick Tom Colicchio Craftsteak and a ton of other Vegas steakhouses over this place. Only slightly better than Sugar Factory (and that place really sucks)",

The Pork Belly was undercooked and the oysters were massive and undercooked.  I was hoping for a comeback with the ribeye for two, but again lacked flavor and was just cut in half and thrown on a plate, most places will slice it nicely for you.  Overall I would try other established steakhouses in Vegas skip this one. Tom should pack up his knives and go!",

The onion soup is excellent and almost bisque like, the char-grilled octopus may be the best we have had, and the lamb was excellent. We were very happy with the service, and the extensive wine list is very drinkable and within reason for pricing.",

Everything was incredible. For main courses we shared ribeye, New York strip and duck breast.  Again all were perfectly prepared and amazing.

    "text": "I was able to experience The Heritage during my short Vegas trip; admittedly being late- the hostesses where polite. Decor can do so much for a setting, and I absolutely enjoyed the nice deep settings, dark tones throughout the restaurant where the logs of wood on a wall gave a rustic and simultaneously soothing touch in its entire simplicity giving it a bit of an edge. The repetitiveness of the rods/panels are subtle in its complexity- very pleasing and calming for the audience.  The waiters themselves where incredibly polite, informative and tentative. I order the filet mignon- I'm not much of a meat eater and was thoroughly pleased with its hormone free (and all that other great stuff all meat should be) slab of joy. The risotto has me salivating at its thought and their puree potatoes were great as well. Though the mint and blueberry bourbon drink won me over...love at first sip, anyone? Lovely atmosphere, close in sitting proximity but politeness in ones table and in others can diminish any 'too close,' of a bother. I give it a four and a half mint & blueberry bourbon drinks, out of five....so five by default of the rating system.",

We had the NY sirloin and braised short ribs along with the creamless creamed corn and spicy onion rings. Everything was amazing!!! We finished with two desserts that couldn't have been any better.

We were immediately warmly greeted by the bartender, Justin, and even though the place was slammed, he patiently took the time to answer all of our questions about the menu and cocktails and was entertaining and making us laugh the entire time.

The decor of the restaurant modern and sets the mood for the great food.  For appetizers we had the Grilled Octopus, Chicken Wings, and Hamachi. The fish was amazing in texture and taste while the octopus was grilled to tender perfection. The chicken wings while moist I didn't care for too much because they didn't knock my socks off.   I had the rib eye steak cooked to medium and it came out perfect. I loved the caramelized onions that paired perfectly with the steak. While the steak itself was nothing to right home about I appreciate the fact it was seasoned right. Not too salty as some steak houses tend to do.  The sides are a la carte and we tried the whipped potatoes, sauteed broccoli, and roasted carrots. The carrots and potatoes were divine, while the broccoli was very spicy that left an odd taste for me. That was what kept me from giving 5 stars.   I'd recommend this place for the ambiance, service and food.",

He was attentive, polite, very personable, and made the overall experience unforgettable.   On to the food   - Octopus: tender and had the perfect amount of char. The leek puree paired beautifully with the peppers.   - Tartare: we have never seen this type of preparation before and I of all people always say, \"never judge a book by its cover\", but we were a little skeptical when it first came out. As soon as I took the first bite, all skepticism flew out the window. It was like driving a finely tuned car for the first time. It was an extremely well balanced dish.  -A5 wagyu: not much to say other than I feel bad for all of the future steaks I will consume. Everything will be compared to this. We requested it medium rare and it literally melted in our mouths. We were going to order the foie as a side, but I'm glad we didn't. The wagyu provided plenty of richness on it's own.  - Truffle Risotto: decided on this (still very rich) instead of the foie. I needed to know what a legitimate risotto tasted like. It was creamy, velvety, earthy and was unlike any risotto we've had before.  Service at Heritage was excellent and the food was second to none. After this dining experience, life will never be the same.",

FOOD: --------- As our group asked for my opinion on appetizers, I knew I had to select the **Smoked Pork Terrine** because it offered the sublime foie gras, of which I have been deprived for ages, being a Californian and all. Combined with delicious pickled figs and pepper jelly atop a piece of bread, this appetizer was everything I wanted and more.  I was a little worried that choosing the **Roasted Market Fish** would be a total mistake, but it was delicious! It turned out to be Sea Bass with a tomato paste and zucchini relish. The bass was prepared perfectly, being sufficiently firm while also smoothly melting in the mouth. This would rival any bass from an acclaimed seafood restaurant. I sampled a piece of Anna's **Porterhouse** and it was divine. I would definitely order it on my next visit.  For side dishes we got the roasted mushrooms, asparagus, creamless sweet creamed corn. We all thought the asparagus could have used some more flavoring or some sort of creative twist, but the corn was a huge hit with its buttery smoothness.  SERVICE / AMBIANCE: ------------------------------- Absolutely outstanding. Every member of the staff we encountered was on point, very warm and helpful, and extremely professional. Our server had an entertaining sense of humor. Even the busser impressed us with his refined gestures.  The decor is mod and clean with beautiful wood accents everywhere. The open kitchen in the back is a nice touch.  Of course you get what you pay for, so be ready to lay down some cash. For four people (3 steaks, 1 fish, 3 sides, 4 drinks), we each fronted about $100.  DATE TIP: With swankified dining at its best, How could your date not be impressed?",

    "text": "As an east coast NY food snob and fan of Tom Colicchio's Craft in the city, I wasn't all that jazzed about grabbing a bite to eat at this steak house nestled in the middle of the make shift rain forest in the Mirage hotel. But I was sure glad that I did. We sat at the bar and were greeted by one of the most personable and handsome young bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He hailed from Poland but has been in the US and in Las Vegas now for many years and could converse about anything from mixology to golf! And he was an absolute flawless mixologist all the while preparing drinks for the main restaurant, inputting food orders, serving us and keeping us entertained.   I ordered the 19th on Fab and my husband sipped on the Tom's Collins which were savory and herbacious and completely refreshing and delicious. These rank among some of the best cocktails we have ever had.  We snacked on the gazpacho, the grilled romaine caesar, the charred octopus appetizer and a scallop skewer. The food was very tasty and nicely plated. Gazpacho had perfect texture, which is really not a slam dunk if you're like us and order gazpacho wherever we go! Octopus was supple and cooked perfectly. The only misstep was the scallop skewer. Although the two sizeable scallops were accompanied by some fresh greens and seared nicely with good caramelization, they were just a tad overcooked which made them just a bit chewy to the bite. Other than that, we were very pleased.   The vibe is nice, the food and drinks quite stellar and the service absolutely on point. Definitely a nice option in the Mirage Hotel or even as a destination if you're staying elsewhere.",

The steak I had here was prime sirloin. I've had better steak at Outback OR a greasy spoon diner. Pretentious service, overpriced sides, led to a $400 bill for 4 people and we only had one glass of wine each, $25 for Frank Family Cab, good, but $25 per glass? Really? Never again. My wife's salmon was $38 and tiny. We make better at home. Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak is an epic fail. I won't be back!",

    "text": "Nice evening with friends.  But make no mistake this restaurant is typical Vegas pricing so don't be shy when you walk in! Steaks are in the 50 plus and the drinks are 15-17.....The service is attentive and the staff is very polite but their beverages are a bit slow. So we ordered a couple of filet's, a New York,fois gras and a salmon entree. So everything comes al carte so let's start there. We also ordered a few beet salads and a chop salad or two and the lobster bisque. Well the beet salads were not exactly cooked al denote. They were more like raw so super crispy and bitter. The chopped butter lettuce salad was delicious and light. Very nice. The salmon was sent back due to flavor but the restaurant still charged for the meal... then the NY steak was a bit tough. Now the filets were super and well cooked and nice cuts!! The fois was well seasoned and loved the pomegranate seeds and sauce on this appetizer($24). The sides we ordered were French fries, pass on those as they are nothing special, the Brussels sprouts. Which were a little to under dome for my taste but still good, the kale (which was ok) and the mushrooms which were very good!",

It's right in the middle of the garden area next to the front desk area. When you walk into the restaurant you will first see the lounge area, which you can still dine in but to get to the dining room you still have to keep walking towards the back.   I had ordered the rack of lamb, best i've ever tried. So juicy and so soft, of course depending how you want it cooked, mine was medium rare. The only thing i do regret is the drink ordered whih was the Blackberry Bourbon Smash, dont get me wrong the drink was delicious but it definitely did not go well with the lamb, it was too sweet for my entree.  My friend ordered the bone marrow as his entree. It was very good and it has chunks of lobster on the top, again very delicious but i dont recommend you order as your main entree because it will not fill you up, i would order it more as a side order.",

There was an additional fun touch of complimentary jerky brought to the table.  A nice subtle difference you won't find anywhere else.  All in all, a great experience.",

Located close to the front of the Mirage casino, it has a open spacing to the casino with dimmed lighting for an intimate atmosphere.  We sat at the bar/lounge area.  Staffs are attentive and courteous.  Table service is just like if we were in the fine dining area.      We got the grilled caesar, yellowtail tartar, aged steak (to share) and truffle risotto side.  Everything tasted delicious.  I wished that there were more of the yellowtail and it was a great way to start the meal.  Price is approximately 100 per person.  A bit pricey for a meal but it was really good.  I would recommend (maybe not as often) but definitely worth a try.",

I had the Filet, medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  I started with a caesar salad and enjoyed some red wine with the people I came to dinner with.

On Wednesday we went to see the Cirque du Soleil show Love and then had dinner at Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. While making our reservation Harold mentioned that we were going out as a late birthday present and that Top Chef was something my late husband Aaron and I loved to share together so we chose Heritage to make the evening extra special.  I cannot even begin to tell you what an amazing evening the staff at Heritage set up for us. From the private table ready and waiting. To the extra starters, sides and birthday desserts they brought for us. I could not have felt more special. The service was the best we've ever experienced. The executive sous chef told our servers that they were \"taking care of us tonight\". They absolutely did. I cannot recommend Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak enough. They didn't know me, or my story. They didn't have to do anything at all for us. But they did. They truly made the evening so so memorable. To Amy and the rest of the staff from the bottom of my heart, I want to say, Thank you.",

    "text": "Over the past 8 years of marriage my wife and I have tried to go to a new steakhouse for our anniversary dinner. We almost broke that trend this year when we planned to return to Del Frisco's in Las Vegas. The day before our anniversary we changed our mind and went with the suggestion of the box office employee for Terry Fator making a reservation with Heritage Steakhouse inside the Mirage.   I placed the reservation via Opentable and in the notes mentioned it was for our 8th anniversary. That was it until the night of our anniversary. I stopped by to confirm our reservation on our way to the Terry Fator show and the hostess asked if we were going to any shows. I said we were and she asked if I wanted to move my reservation up from 930 to 9 because the show would be done around 9 and they would hold my reservation until I arrived so we did not have to wait the extra half hour. I agreed which is great because we were starving by the time the show was done.   After the show we went back to Heritage. Almost immediately a hostess greeted us with Happy Anniversary and led us to our table. We were sitting for maybe 30 seconds to a minute before our server Farzad came up and greeted us with \"Happy Anniversary! Welcome to Heritage and I am excited I get to make your night memorable\". He asked if we were in a rush, which we were not, so he took his time going over different nuances of the menu and the restaurant. When asked about drinks my wife said, \"I'm kind of a martini snob...most people cannot make it the way I like it.\" He asked, \"How do you like it? Our bar is the best there is so I know they can make it the way you like it.\" My wife said, \"I like it extra dirty with extra olives.\" Farzad returned shortly with the bar tender who hand delivered one of the best martinis my wife had ever had. I drank a red ale recommended by the server and it was an excellent choice.   We opted to go for dessert after the meal rather than a first course so we started with our entrees and a shared side. My wife go the bone-in Ribeye and I got the grilled Ribeye. We shared a side of creamed Swiss Chard. Man-alive...by far the best steaks we have eaten and we are from South Texas. The side was delicious and certainly large enough to share. It was a delightful meal to say the least.  In order to have room for dessert we did have to take some of the steak back with us but it was worth it. We ordered the S'mores Fritter and when it was brought out so were two mini lemon cakes with candles for us presented with another Happy Anniversary congratulations. The lemon cakes and the S'mores Fritter were delicious. Capped off with a cup of coffee we were completely satisfied.   Well done Heritage. Your staff made us feel special and certainly provided us with a memorable experience. Farzad was one of the best servers we have ever had and I would highly recommend any others try to get him as their server.   Another highly recommended restaurant if you are in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Best filet I've ever tasted.  For appy's, we had the wood-roasted peaches, grilled octopus, grilled shrimp & spicy braised pork belly.  All were very unique (ie heads on the shrimp) and good (solid B+), but the octopus & the pork belly (not spicy at all so don't be afraid to order) stole the show (A+ for both) for this course.  The sommelier was just a tad bit disappointing.   She was given some parameters (max price, red, no particular region, drinkable) and took more time than I would expected to offer her recommendations.  She only gave one recommendation and it was $5 under our max price.   She clearly had the description of the wine down to a T, but when questioned about grape blend, she faltered so it seemed as if she didn't truly \"know\" her wines.  Her selection was not getting great reviews from the table so for the next bottle, the closet wine snob in our group chose.   It was unanimous that the 2nd bottle was much better.  She was about C+....so slightly better than average & really I expected better.  For entrees we had short-rib, lamb and filet.   The short-rib was buttery smooth and very rich and my husband said the tomatoes were the best tomatoes he's ever tasted (A+).  I did not taste the lamb, but the person who ordered it said it was amazing, so I'm going to assume an A+ here as well and the filet (5 people at our table ordered this) was knock-my-socks off good so obviously an A+.  I am not usually a fan of filet but whenever I get a hankering for a faboo hunk of beef, we'll head to Heritage!  Some of our entrees came with a small side on the plate already (filet had baby roast potatoes & the short rib had tomatoes & some baby roast potatoes).  Additional sides were hand-cut fries (solid C...nothing special), brussel sprouts (WOW! A+), roasted mushrooms (assorted types...A) and potato puree (B-nothing special here either so save your carbs).    Deserts - I was not wow'd.  We had pineapple upside down cake, the molten chocolate cake, bacon fritters and peach sorbet.  The molten chocolate cake was the best & the bacon fritters were the biggest disappointment of the entire meal.    A note about the menu...it changes so some of the items may/may not be on there depending on when you go.  A note about the service....our waiter was fabulous.   Some of the other staff not so much (re-read note above about sommelier!) ...my biggest disappointment was the young lady who cleared away & brought plates.  She kept reaching over people instead of reaching between & across the table.  That's a basic any waiter/waitress wannabe should know.  The food was so good though I didn't let it affect my rating.  Plus they've only been open 5 weeks.  I'm sure they'll figure it out.",

It was late I didn't want to have a heavy dinner, so i ordered the duck from the appetizer section.  I've eaten duck at other places and I can taste the duck flavor.  I couldn't even taste the duck flavor, they served it on top of cooked grape leafs which i ate too since i really enjoyed the flavors.  I couldn't really tell what spices they used but if you don't like your food with so many different spices this place isn't for you.  I also had a taste of my friends plate, I don't know what it was called but it was also from the appetizer section, but it was raw meat, they served it with garlic bread that looked like long thin croutons. very delicious.",

Justin knows the pulse of Vegas and was a pleasure to be served by. While the prices may turn off some, a True steak house lover won't mind at all.

The lobster was light and flavorful, the oysters were big and wonderful as well...we continued on to our starters of various salads and the bone marrow all of which were amazing. We then all continued onto our main course with numerous types of steaks and or pork and I cannot speak highly enough of how amazing my medium rare fillet mignon was! Had sides of brussels sprouts, onion rings, the baked potatoes, the mashed potatoes, the mushrooms and the truffle risotto all of which were so complimentary to all of our meals. I will say if I had to choose... I would do the risotto and baked with onions potatoes. Then we ended our meals with an array of desserts, again if I had to choose I would go with the pumpkin donuts! Out of this world. The service was bar non, constantly checked on us, replaced dirty silverware, refilled  our water glasses and were overall very friendly and professional. I am a local and not sure how many times I could come here as the prices are high. But I am extremely glad I was able to try this place, as I am beyond happy with everything I had and the entire dining experience.",

We were all very underwhelmed, and all agreed we would not come back.  Service was spotty at best.  The only thing that was consistent was that our water glasses stayed full, which I actually appreciate more than most people.  But a full water glass is not a good enough reason to spend $100+ per person. Our waiter  kept disappearing for long periods of time.  At one point I actually said to him \"where have you been?\" and he joked about being in back goofing off..  Wtf? My steak was not cooked properly at all, but since no one checked back to see if it was ok, I just ended up eating it, and being disappointed. The general vibe we all got from the employees was that they all thought they were pretty cool, and they didn't really care what we thought. There are way too many quality steakhouses up and down the Strip to have to put up with a mediocre place like this.",

Decent sized portion, full flavor (vadouvan and pickles paired great), well cooked and presented perfectly.   For our main course I had the Duck Breast stuffed with Duck Chorizo on collard greens with smoked peaches and my wife had a Filet.  The Duck was a home run, cooked to perfection with the skin on giving a great contrast in texture. The chorizo gave the dish just enough spice, while the greens offered an earthy taste and the peaches gave it a smokey savory finish.  I took a risk not ordering a prime cut of steak, and in the end I was more than happy with the duck.   My wife ordered the 10oz filet. It was seasoned very well and cooked to perfection. It was served with grilled potatoes.   Service was top notch, ambiance was great considering the place is in the atrium at the center of The Mirage. They've done a fantastic job with the acoustics, you don't hear a peep from the casino floor outside.   Will defiantly be back. Well done Mr. Colicchio!",

The drinks were too strong. At places like this I expect to have a nice craft cocktail that balances the mixers with the alcohol. I ordered a Caesar salad. Not very good. They charr the romain. I usually order my steaks medium rare but from the explanation from the server it sounded like it would actually be rare so I order medium rare. Good cal because my steak was cooked how I like it. The steak was good but not too impressed. Overall I would just recommend going somewhere else if you are out and wanting to enjoy a nice steakhouse.",

We started with their corn chowder with smoked bacon and their baby arugula salad...so delicious! Their filet mingon was cooked to perfection, cut like butter. I ordered their duck breast with the smoked peaches, just divine. Their mashed potatoes were so buttery. The only issue I had was for desert we ordered the double peach pie. My fiance and I were expecting a mile high of peaches... I felt like we ate one peach. We should've gotten desert elsewhere.  Other than that dinner is must here if you want to go for a fancy dinner on the strip.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been searching for a place that combines amazing food and great customer service. Who would have thought we would find it in Las Vegas. Long way to travel for this ultimate dining experience.   Seems like every chef has at least two restaurants in one of the Las Vegas hotels so don't get this mixed up with this other one in MGM, This restaurant is located in the Mirage Hotel. I feel like he made a mistake calling one Heritage Steak and the other Craftsteak as folks might get the two confused if you don't like one of them. Anyways, moving on.  My husband and I were leaving the hotel and passed by this restaurant and decided to just try this one instead of going down south. We approached the hostess station and they were both cheerful and ready to seat us.   As soon as we sat down, one of the assistance of our server came over to explain the menu to us and offer us drinks. Later on our server came by and we were still trying to decide what to get. Wanted to go with the 6oz Japanese Wagyu with the 2lb lobster tail or should we go with the 32oz Ribeye. Hard choice. We couldn't decide as there were American Wagyu, Australian Wagyu, and Japanese Wagyu. Our server was so passionate about the food they served, I decided to make an executive decision myself and ordered for my husband too. Haha  I told our server I wanted to go with American Wagyu Skirt steak and the Australian Wagyu Flatiron steak. Our server next recommended we get the Skirt steak medium rare and the Flatiron medium. We also got roasted mushrooms to go with our meal. Oh yeah and then we got the charred octopus which is one of their most popular dish.   After our server left, we got some cheesy rolls with butter and two good size beef jerky. We seldomget butter that is soft and ready to be spread but this one was. It did not just come out of the fridge cold. The roll wasn't my favorite as it was a little on the hard and dry side. But OMG the beef jerky was a good 3 inch, 1 for me and 1 for my husband. The beef jerky is really good but I don't have words to describe it. It was soft like it was just dried yesterday. It had the smokey, salty flavor. I love beef jerky.   Charred octopus did not sound good to husband who is a steak and potato guy but he was willing to try it. Three pieces of the arms/tentacles with roasted peppers and leeks. Are you kidding me!! This was amazing!!! The octopus perfectly cooked. It was not overcooked and therefore too soft and mushy. It wasn't undercooked where you have to chew and chew like it was bubble gum. Can I say it chews like you're eating a piece of chicken as I alsmost forgot it was octopus. The roasted, pickled peppers added the contrast you needed to go with the octopus. I couldn't believe how much my husband actually liked the octopus as well. I could have eaten it as a meal, if they put a few more pieces on there.   Our steak was juicy and easy to slice. The flatiron was a bit on the grainier side and the skirt was smooth and slightly marbled. Both were easy to cut, do we even need a steak knife? Perfect seasoning, perfectly cooked. What else can I ask for when my steak is cooked perfectly. My one complaint was the roasted mushroom. It was a bit on the saltier side but that was it.   We don't drink alcohol so you'll have to rely on someone else on the wine.   I can definitely overlook the roll and the roasted mushroom as everything else was perfect. Great service, great food, now that is Top Chef worthy experience. This was one of my favorite Las Vegas experience on this trip.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place; I really do, because we had an amazing family meal at Craftsteak previously, and we believe in the Colicchio brand.  However, as all the previous reviewers stated, the steaks are good but not great.   The evening started with the free appetizers. The beef jerky that others have talked about were a nice start, but nothing to write home about. The bread was tasty, reminiscent of the ones at Red Lobster.   Between the four of us, we ordered the beets and the octopus. Although the texture of the octopus was really unique, I did not feel that the flavor was where it should be. The beets were good, but again, not amazing.   I had the Wagyu flatiron, as our guy suggested. In track with the theme, the steak was good, but it did not blow me away. Maybe I am expecting too much, but I don't think it's unfair to compare it to the sister restaurant (the flank steak I had at CraftSteak was amazing). The chimichurri sauce was a nice touch, but it didn't sway me enough. The rest of the table also thought other local steak places had better products also.   The mud ice cream cake was really good. Our friends seemed to like the coconut pie as well.   The biggest highlight was the service. Multiple people other than our server helped us with menu selections, water refills, and even a missing napkin. They were attentive without being intrusive. I tipped a top percentage for the service, but I think only so much premium can be paid for great atmosphere and service without truly excellent food.   Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really think the value is not there, especially when there are many other better values locally. I will almost certainly try another restaurant or go back to Craftsteak before returning.",

But with my experience with his other restaurants, I knew he could do it right.  Started off with their take on onion soup. It really was tasty. The cheese covered crostini in a puree of onion and other goodness. Fantastic.  For the main course I went with the recommended ribeye. Topped it off with the black truffle sauce.  It was very good.   As a side I got the risotto. This was also quite good.  For desert I ordered the Ricotta fritters with \"popcorn ice cream\" and carmel corn. These were awesome! Maybe even the highlight of the meal. I have to tip my hat to the man who came up with popcorn ice cream.   Overall, this was a very solid meal. Tom Colicchio certainly delivers on steak. I wouldnt say it was the best I have ever had. It was certainly top notch. Plus the service was excellent. It was pricey as expected but not over the top pricey. Heritage was a solid choice all around.",

I walked up to the hostess stand and Paula had her head down staring at the computer. About a minute later my friend and I were still not greeted and I said it would be nice to be acknowledged. After I said this she quickly said I will be right with you. I told her we were coming here for dessert and she said we could only sit in the lounge area. My friend and I walked towards the back to check out the setting of the main restaurant before we chose a place to sit in the lounge. Paula chases after us and says I told you the main restaurant is only for people eating a full meal. I felt as though she was speaking to me in a condescending manner and her response lacked any type of refined social behavior.  I told the manager what had happened and that I was going to leave. He really didn't say much and looked at me like it was going in one ear and out the other. I was surprised at the complete lack of customer service skills.",

The mashed potatoes and broccoli were okay but not great, and they forgot to bring my companion's blue cheese. Given the prices ($60 to 150 per steak) I'd expect better. The onion rings were top notch and the shrimp, oysters and crab appetizer was mostly very good - the oysters were not great, but the shrimp and crab were. The staff were polite, friendly and very professional. The setting was fine. Overall a great (if massively expensive) meal. I'm a huge fan of Tom Choliccio and I wish I coulda given it that last star. I'll come back again if somebody else is paying!",

He ordered the filet medium rare- and I ordered the NY strip- medium well- and said, \" I want very little pink\" Our meat came and I cut into mine and it was so red and bloody. I waited for the waiter, and he said, \" we're better than that- that's not the way you ordered it, we are better than that. We will get that fixed.\"  It was sent back. The manager came out and apologized and said I'll check on it make sure it comes as quickly as possible etc.  The 2nd piece of meat came and it was just like the first, in fact, my medium well was rarer than my dates medium rare filet!!  We called over the guy who brought our plate and said this is just like before. ( our waiter never checked back on us).  The manager came over again, apologizing, never offered any comp for our experience, and said it would be fixed.  The 3rd time the meat came out- it was STILL RARE!  My boyfriend is still waiting for me before he eats- so his meal is now cold- the sides are cold- and it's now 9:20.   We stood up - looked at the manager and said, \" we're leaving, this is ridiculous!\"  We left them with the tab for our 2 drinks and ceviche appetizer and a filet that was untouched. I've never had to leave a \"4 star\" restaurant in my life!  I would not recommend this place. Shouldn't the cook at a steakhouse know how the meat should be cooked?",

    "text": "Going to have to go with a solid two star 'Meh' on this one.    - The Background If you're a tourist then feel free to disregard this particular review as i'm writing from a Vegas Local's prospective. I'm unaware of your (yes you the person reading this) current situation but i'm going to assume you're in town for a few days visiting from somewhere either on holiday or business, have limited information on places off the strip that serve close of not the same quality of food catered to locals, and don't have your own method of transportation as well as the thing most precious to us all, Time.  If that assumption is correct please disregard this review and move on to another.   A Tom Colicchio location carries a certain level of prestige as he is a well known Chef. My expectations were high as myself and the fellas decided to dine here. Mainly i avoid Strip restaurants due to the food not having a wow factor to justify the price. Lets face it, it's Vegas and it's a Strip Casino location so everything is going to be marked up regardless. A bad place makes you regret spending money here, a good place you can justify the cost, an excellent place makes you come back for more. So how does Heritage stand up? Well read on and see...  - The Experience From the minute you walk in you're greeted by lovely hostess and either asked to wait or explore the bar or seated to your table. Left of the hostess station (viewer perspective) there's a large interactive touch screen to let you browse the menu along with prices. Pictures would be nice but it's kept short and simple to arouse curiosity and keep passerbyers from loitering that screen too long.   As you're walked to your table, depending on where the table is of course, the area is absolutely gorgeous except for one huge stain i'm still trying to figure out why. All the staff are dressed to impress. They do an excellent job of blending in with the night life crowd but stand out enough to know that they're not here to party they're here for the guests. The servers, wait staff, and busers all do a superb job of setting up and maintaining the dining experience.   - The Food  First Courses   - Heirloom Tomatoes The larger slices were a solid 'meh' as the texture was soggy and not very flavorful. Most of the tomatoes were bland and couldn't hold there own as well as very little balsamic to hold everything together. Every now and then there was a cherry tomato that was just absolutely heavenly but those were few. The cheese had a lovely half melted soft velvety texture but again, not enough balsamic and didnt really stand on it's own or with the help of bland tomatoes.    - Grilled Octopus Absolutely delicious. Tender as hell meat grilled to perfection with enough on the plate to enhance the flavors of the octopus. A must get   - Ash-Roasted Bone Marrow Another absolutely delicious dish. The overly richness of the bone marrow is cut with the lovage and i think granny smith apple salad. The lobster was a refreshing note as well. Added much needed meaty texture.  The Sides Knowing what i know now about the menu and portion sizes i would highly encourage skipping out on the first courses and ordering extra sides. For one the sides are much cheaper at the trade off of not being as complex as the appetizers The portion sizes are MUCH larger as well. One side is enough to cover 2 to 3 diners. 1 if you don't enjoy your company too much.   - Fingerling Potatoes I assumed this would be a savory dish but it turned out to have quite a sweet glaze. If you're into that sort of thing this side would be right up your alley. I prefer it to be roasted with rosemary then drizzled with olive oil and light dash of course sea salt  - Spicy Onion Rings These rings are HUGE. They're deep fried to a well done perfection and aren't that greasy. A bit overly salty but the mustard dipping sauce is perfect. You could put this sauce on a tire and it might just make it edible.   - Grilled Mushrooms Wow...just...WOW. I would come here, get a table for one or maybe at the bar and eat an entire side of this and just this if i could. Lots of different types of mushrooms with none of that white button stuff, tossed in buttery and garlicy sauce grilled to heavenly divinity. Give me two orders to go i'm putting some on everything from instant ramen to waffles!  The Steaks I'm a NY Strip kinda guy. I like lean quality steak medium rare. The strip i was served with attached to a nice hunk of fat rarely found on NY Strips and not being a 'chew the fat' kind of eater that piece was donated to me mates which praised me for the donation. All in all it was a high quality cut that's been VERY well taken care of and prepared but....seriously lacked in the flavor department. With all the fancy wood oak oven/grill our server was talking there wasn't much grilled flavor not even a char grilled fat flavor from the edges. overall...'Meh' (would explain but reached review limit)",

I hosted customers last night and everything was perfect. Sommelier suggested a beautiful, well-priced red blend. The special Manhattan was made like a Manhattan should be made, but rarely is these days. My Wagyu skirt steak was probably one of the best steaks I have had anywhere.  I'm not a huge fan of The Mirage hotel - I stayed because the conference we sponsored was there - but I will absolutely come back to the Heritage steakhouse again.",

We were there at 9pm on a Sunday, and constantly felt like we were inconveniencing them. We were not rushed; however at one point all the servers seemed to disappear at the end of service. Sommelier was friendly; however, he did not get the chance to speak to us about our wine selection before one of the nameless servers almost bullied us into a wine that he \"recommended\" for us. This recommendation was a condescension against us - young dinners. There was a clear assumption by the waiting staff that we didn't know anything about wine or food. That was certainly the attitude of the server who recommended our wine. Would have loved to talk to the sommelier first. The food was just ok compared to other craft steakhouses- NY strip was certainly on the fatty side. However, rissotto was excellent! The dessert we got (cheesecake with funnel cake and brownie) was odd and didn't feel like something Tom Collichio would want his name on. Generally, it was fine, but at this price point ($350+ being conservative), I expect a lot more. Disappointed. Skip this place and go to Craftsteak at the MGM Grand!",

We were welcomed by the gracious hostess who asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or restaurant side, we opted for the restaurant to get the full experience. It took our waiter 20 minutes to greet us with the whole restaurant being pretty much dead. I'm not sure if they were short staffed that night or what but the amount of time we had to wait was ridiculous. The bussers were the ones that really saved the tip at the end of the night. They brought us water and bread and were very prompt with clearing our plates. They even made conversation and were hilarious. One of the bussers noticed that we didn't really touch our salads and asked if we didn't care for it. We answered honestly and said that it had way too much dressing, so one of the bussers tried to get it taken off of our bill and notified our server. Our server returned to our table and never even asked about it. When we received our bill, the salads were still on it. The food was pretty good especially our steaks and the onion rings BUT I probably will never return here again.",

We made reservations, but arrived a little early and were seated promptly. The entire staff was wonderful, very professional and welcoming. We started with the pork belly. Neither of us had ever eaten it before but we weren't disappointed. It was absolutely delicious. For our entrees I had the Tabasco marinated skirt steak and hubby had the ribeye. We also had the mushrooms and the truffle risotto. Our meals were fantastic. I was so excited about eating at Tom Colicchio's restaurant because I love Top Chef, and it totally lived up to the hype. After our meals the staff presented us with small cupcakes to celebrate our anniversary. The whipped topping was to die for. I was so full from dinner but I could have eaten like 10 of those!! The only thing I regret is that I couldn't eat more!!  If you're looking for a delicious steakhouse on the strip then please, go here. You won't be disappointed!",

I started with the shrimp cocktail appetizer because the server recommended it over the ceviche. The flavor was good, but the shrimp was definitely overcooked.  I ordered the flatiron steak rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The flavor was very good.  My wife had the Tabasco skirt steak cooked medium, and it came out good. She will probably order it medium rare next time because it came out a little overcooked. The flavor was good though. Be cautious if you can't take too much heat.  We had mushrooms and potato puree for sides, and they were pretty standard.  Overall, it's a good place, and I would come here again. Not for anything in particular though.",

    "text": "Go for the Steak!  We chose Heritage Steaks because we were going to a show and wanted an upscale dining experience at the Mirage. We made reservations on OpenTable and requested a quiet, romantic table. We got a table on the far Left outer edge of the dining room. My husband has to have his back to a wall or be facing the the front door, so he got to sit on the cushion side and I got to sit in a chair facing him and the wall. I didn't mind the view of him, but it was somewhat disappointing only seeing a wall. He also noted that we seemed to have been sat in the \"family & tourist\" section, despite being locals and OpenTable members. On to the food! We ordered the Shrimp Cocktail to start and I have to say it was Delicious!! The shrimp were Huge and the sauce was delectable! I wanted to order another one as my entree but decided to try other things. Next, Hubby got a Caesar Salad that was perfectly satisfying and I got the Crab fondue. The fondue was weird...plenty of crab but it was sitting on top of mashed potatoes and needed more salt and pepper. I wouldn't order it again. We ordered a Barolo from the Somolier and he decanted it for us. We split the Bone-in Ribeye and it was cooked perfectely medium-rare, gorgeous flavor and cut like butter! We also added King Crab on the side - Wonderful!! We also got a side of Onion Rings but could only eat a couple of them because we were full!! We would love to go back for dessert. All in all, it was a great experience and the food was worth going back for!!",

We had reservations for 9:30, and our bus was late, so we arrived a few minutes after 10, thinking that we'd still be able to dine in the lounge, which is advertised as being open until 11.   Here's the thing: our lateness was totally our fault, but the hostess was not only ungracious about it, she was downright rude. She made us feel chastised when we were already contrite, and didn't offer to seat us for drinks or whatever else was happening in the clearly open lounge , or offer to make reservations for a future date. She pointed out the time and just started at us, stony-faced, even after we said thank you and turned to leave.  I'm heartbroken. My first visit here in 2013 rated among my top 5 dining experiences. I won't return to a place that makes me feel unwelcome, and I will be sure to tell all my friends.",

So we downed our beverages while they sat the rest of our party.   The menu is not very large and not many choices when it comes to salads and sides. The prices were too high for what we felt the quality of the food was. The potatoes were great and the steak skewers were enjoyed. When we compared the bone in rib eye to mastros or Ruth's Chris, this steak was not as good.   Troy, our server was awesome and everyone else was very attentive. They did not acknowledge the birthdays either and that bummed me out. I would not want to come back to this steak house. Was just sub par in our opinion.

For being a Tom Colicchio restaurant, I was very disappointed with the sanitation (or lack thereof) I observed from behind the bar.  I never once saw the bartender wash his hands.  He handled the straws by their tips when he placed them in their drinks, and he handled the fruit with his bare hands when adding them to the brim of a cocktail.  He collected money with those same hands, and then used the touchscreen computer to add it all up.  God knows what germs are being spread around that place, as it appeared like some very basic food handling rules are being ignored.  I think Subway Sandwiches has a better sanitation practices.",

It was perfectly cooked to medium rare and spicy enough to let me know it's there without singeing my mouth.  Good cocktails...I knocked back a couple of dirty martinis and they were well mixed. I don't drink wine but there was a nice selection according to my companion.  We had the ice cream sampler for dessert and it was outstanding. Milk and Cookies was our favorite...a mix of cookies n cream and cookie dough. Yum.  We had excellent service, possibly because we were one of only two parties eating. We had a 5pm meal because we were leaving on the red eye that night. But our waiter was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  Definitely worth a visit.",

First, we tried to go in the bar about 20 minutes before our reservation to have a cocktail before dinner.  The hostesses told us the bar was too busy, which there were tons of seats, even at the bar.  That is just weird to me.   The service was just so so,.  We ordered the 10 oz. filet & we each ordered the $14 house salad which was an ENORMOUS bowl of  spring mix with some cucumbers & a few nice cherry tomatoes. Bigger is not always  better.  If you get the salad, split it. Our waiter should have informed us,  so we each ate about a quarter of it.  We had a side of their mushrooms with our steak which was just okay also.  The only green vegetable was Brussels sprouts....no asparagus or green beans.  Many people just don't like Brussels sprouts! However I guess if I could have forced down the huge salad, i guess I would have had all the greens I needed.  Not saying I would never go back, but nothing made me look forward to another visit.",

Had to send our order back because they were really raw in the middle. They were graciously replaced with some fresh, well-done ones. Just wish the heat was turned down a bit on these.

    "text": "I have eaten at many of the Las Vegas steakhouses and have to say I was impressed with Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak.  I did come in with slightly tempered expectations having eaten at CraftSteak at the MGM hotel previously, but am glad to report that this dining experience was far superior to that at Craftsteak.  We arrived at the restaurant a little past our reservation and with an additional guest, but the hostess quickly adjusted our reservation and directed us to the neatly decorated bar area, while she prepared our table.  Within 5 minutes we were sat and I will say that the dining area was very well designed with a cool mix of contemporary fixtures and furniture with the Mirage outdoor feel.    We started with a bottle of Prisoner Zinfendel blend, which was pretty impressive, and the Yellowtail and Pork Belly appetizers.  The yellowtail was tasty but small portioned,  as was the pork belly, which is slightly disappointing compared to other starters at major steakhouses in Vegas.   Several indivudals ordered the pork and individual steaks as their main entree (all looked delictable), but myself and another enjoyed the 28 Day Dry aged Rib Eye.  Nothing too unique or special about the sear or cook, which is how I like my steak.  The taste was fantastic and very flavorful.  As most rib eyes are, it was a little fatty, but the portion filled myself and partner in crime up.  We shared several sides, favorite of which was the burssel sprouts and mushrooms.    The desert ordered was the gingerbread pudding which looked great, but I did not attempt to have another bite following the steak.    Service overall was great. Everyone was very attentive and several waitors/waitresses were happy to come over and check in on us while the main order taker was busy.    Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would recommend eating here if you have a chance.  While it is not in the upper echelon of steak houses in Vegas, the atmosphere is great and makes up for perhaps the lack in flavor and wow factor of the food.",

I brought my own bottle of wine and found the corkage fee a bit excessive, but not objectionable so. And the sommelier, Larry, was knowledgeable and attentive. That went along way to easing negative feelings.  The salad: Bib lettuce with crumbled Blue cheese, pickled baby red onion, wood bacon, and pumpernickel...Fantastic.  But the star of the show... the steak, a 12 oz prime Filet Mignon. I've some bad luck getting a steak done just the way I like, so I told them how I like it - charred with a warm red center. It was perfect, absolutely sublime.  This was a great meal and hands down, the best steak I've had in Las Vegas in nearly 3 decades. Thank you Tom Colicchio and the entire crew at Heritage Steak.",

    "text": "Tom Colicchio's Heritage Restaurant provided the worst dinner of those I had during my 5 day visit to Vegas. The beet salad was absent any trace of salt- so very bland. The first steak served by Tom Colicchio's staff was overcooked. It was returned. The second steak served by Tom Colicchio's staff was nearly raw. Tom Colicchio's staff started over on the 3rd steak which was also served nearly raw. See the photo I posted. The baked potato served by Tom Colicchio's staff was small ($12) and featured damp/limp skin despite my request that the potato be grilled and served with crisp/charred skin. And really, I know this is Vegas, but $12 for a 75 cent potato with butter and sour cream!!?! For that much money at least they could deliver it as ordered. See the photo I posted. If Tom Colicchio's staff can't properly cook a ribeye on any one of 3 attempts, it paints a rather dark cloud over Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak Restaurant. At least Tom Colicchio's manager had the sense to remove the steak from the bill. Now it's upon Rebecca Wisbey, Assistant General Manager, Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak to reply with a request for more detail. Well, Rebecca, if you have a question, post it. I will reply with an addendum to my original review.  Rebecca, as I posted, ask your question and I will reply.  10/25/18 update: Rebecca Wisbey, Assistant General Manager, Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak, I'm still waiting for you to ask specific questions about our visit to Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak.",

We didn't send it back as everyone else was satisfied with their food, no one else got steaks. The lobster bisque was the star of the night. The bib lettuce salad was really good as well. The biscuits were not tasty and a little over cooked. The risotto was SO CHEESE it was more like cheesy truffle rice. Pretty disappointing overall. Vegas hotels all have steak houses and this one was not what it should be for the price.",

    "text": "I'm a Big fan of Steak and I'm a Big Fan of Tom Colicchio (I watch Top Chef and I own all 3 Cookbooks) but for some Reason my experience here was not that Great. After doing a lot of walking around the Strip, Mostly goofing around and gambling in Caesar's Palace, were both a bit Hungry. Such a classy atmosphere they have and we were sat near Kitchen where they do the expediting. we were waited on by a guy named Mark, told us the specials and we ordered.  I started off with an Appetizer of Berkshire Pork Belly with Cheddar Cheese Crumble and topped with an Apple Butter (this was the only good thing about this Meal) Pork was crispy on the Outside while it was Melt in your Mouth Tender inside, Pork and Apples go so well together and that Rich, Sweet Apple Butter complimented the Pork, my only critique is that I did not taste any Cheddar in the Crumble (maybe they sprinkled some on before it went out). I also had a Cocktail, I made a mistake of ordering a Manhattan. As I've said before me & Bourbon will never get along, the only good thing about that Drink was the Mesquite Hickory Smoked Cherries that were floating in the glass (Sweet & Smoky) but not worth $17.  For our Entrees, since the Halibut was not available I got the Scallops with Golden Raisins and Cauliflower (although the Scallops were perfectly cooked it was way overpriced, $42 for just 4 Scallops). I think it'd be better if there were 6 or 7 Scallops on the plate, too much sauce on top, your not supposed to drown them, Less golden Raisins. But I loved the Cauliflower they prepped it like you would Potato Salad (had a nice Creaminess to it).  Nathan got the Grass Fed Ribeye topped with Cabrales Blue Cheese accompanied with sauces of Sour Cream and Chimichurri. Although that steak was nicely Seasoned and the Blue Cheese wasn't overpowering (I'd prefer a little less) 60% of it was cooked Medium, the other 40% was pink and Bloody so Nathan gave it to me (since I'm the only one in my Family that likes Pink Steak, I squeezed out the Blood though) Nathan ate what he could, he lost his Appetite after that he didn't even eat his freshly made Onion Rings.  Our waiter Mark didn't talk to us that much, me and Nathan felt like he just wanted us to eat and get out. This was my least favorite Dining Experience in Las Vegas, there are so many other places in Vegas to eat: Bouchon Bistro at the Venetian, Sage at Aria, Carnevino at Palazzo, Yellowtail at the Bellagio etc. I'm never dining here again, Don't get me wrong I'm still a fan of Tom Colicchio and what he does, its just this meal didn't fare well with me. Maybe when I go to NYC and go to Craft. I'll have a much better Experience.",

The manager did not offer to take the steak off of our bill and simply apologized - as if this was not the 1st time. What a jerk!

    "text": "Came here with 3 girlfriends before heading to a show on Friday night.  We set up reservations through open table for 8 PM.  Arrived at about 757 PM and were told our table would be ready in 10-15 minutes, which for having dined at Craft last year and had the best meal and best service of my life, I thought waiting past the reservation was strange, but we decided to roll with it and sat in the bar and had a drink.  Ten to fifteen minutes go by, we ask the hostess who refuses to make eye contact with us until we basically have to jump up and down like children, she tells us it will be 10-15 minutes, we explain we were already told that, she says \"I don't know what to tell you.\"  Baffled for a Tom Colicchio establishment to have this rude of a hostess.  Baffled.  It is now 830, our show starts at 10 at Caesar's.  We go looking for the hostess, no where to be found, wait, still no where.  Who leaves the hostess stand empty when there are 5-6 other groups waiting to be seated as well....oh she's at the bar flirting with the bartender.    I finally see a man in a suit, hallelujah a manager who can offer some kind of assistance.  Nope.  He says he'll check and be right back, gone, gone forever.  We decide that #1 we are not eating here, #2 I am not paying for this drink and #3 I want an apology.  I tell stuffy hostess McGee that she can bag our reservation, and have the manager meet us at the bar.  Different suit guy comes, says the table is now ready, we told him we are done.  He offers no apology or reasoning for the fact that it is now 855, only that 55 minutes later we finally have our table and he would like to seat us.  We told him we aren't paying for our drinks and went on our way.    Worst customer service ever.  Just confused and baffled.  Heritage was going to be our big meal out, went to Costa on the other side and the service was amazing and they even comped a round because they felt bad we had to go through so much over at Heritage.    Hey TOM, pay a little more attention to this one, Craft is a well oiled machine, Heritage is a pile of garbage.",

    "text": "Well this is my 3rd year coming to Tom Colicchio's  Heritage Steak House and probably my last. I looked forward so badly to come back here for a wonderful Wagyu Steak. Never again!!  I just couldn't believe I could get this let down.   My husband and I made reservations for 2 nights, Wednesday and Thursday. We cancelled our Thursday reservations due to our Wednesday night experience.   I do want to point out that Amy was our waitress and she's awesome!  Great waitress.   My husband I both ordered the Wagyu steak. You'd think that spending $500 for a meal it would be great. Well.... it wasn't. The Steak was too fatty, burned outside, and way too salty. We kept eating it because we thought it would get better. It was nothing like it was last year. I was so disappointed. That's a lot of money to pay for a crappy Steak. The cheaper one we had at Stacks the night before was much better.   After we ate the steak, my husband and I both felt sick. My husband was up all night sick. The next day he went to talk to the manager. They called in security and had a report written up. .... I guess they assumed we were wanting a freebie meal. Nope... we just wanted to let other patrons know and maybe an apology?  The manager didn't seem to care. He's had our information and hasn't offered an apology or anything.   I was so disappointed. The Wagyu was excellent last year. Nothing like this year. It was heartbreaking. And so disappointing.    I hate to do this, but I'm reducing my 5 stars down to 1. It's amazing how far an apology would have been. I don't even know if I can ever eat steak again. It was such a bad steak. And all that money went down the drain.....   My advice is if you want Wagyu, is to go elsewhere. Not here!  .... maybe we had an old steak?  All I know is that it was too fatty, too salty, and burned areas on it. I'm so disappointed.  I'm surprised that the manager didn't even bother to try to keep our Thursday reservations. NOTHING!  I guess he didn't care if we were happy or not. Or feeling better. If you look at my Yelp Reviews, I think you'll find that it takes A LOT, to get one star. There's very few on my list.",

Nice atmosphere for a dinner to catch up with my parents before a show. Server and wait staff were attentive and friendly...now for the food. Appetizers were all great! Mixed green salad and the endive salad were fantastic. My dad had some of the biggest oysters we have ever seen and delicious! For the entree My parents both ordered the lobster, husband ordered the halibut and I ordered the ny strip. All three said their food was great however I ordered my steak medium and WOW...it came out still mooing blue cold center. After sending it back it was no better so we tried again and man...seems like whoever is on the grill cannot cook a steak...for a steak house that's pretty bad and I was disappointed ...other reviews have said the same thing so hopefully they get this under control because they are a steakhouse and when the fish/seafood dishes are better than the steak...that's an issue. I ended up getting the prime rib that was meh at best. Manager was apologetic but seemed nervous about having to come over and talk to me. By the time my food came out everyone else was done so I felt like I had to rush to eat. I did pick at the sides and the truffle risotto, Brussels sprouts, onion rings and Mac and cheese were all wonderful! We did not have time for desserts. There are so many choices in Vegas when it comes to restaurants. Maybe in the future as a local if I venture back into The Mirage I'll try again but when I'm in the mood for a good steak, I'll go somewhere that can cook a steak...",

Staff from the moment we entered were friendly and attentive! I wish they had more romantic seating options, like booths or larger tables, so couples could sit on the same side, but no big deal. We were seated at a half booth half chair situation.  Now to the food.  Bread and butter: very delicious, I loved the large grains of salt on the butter. Wish butter was not so cold so it would spread a bit nicer  quail skewers: good, but wouldn't order it again. We hadn't tried quail so now we have. Tastes like dark meat chicken, nice flavor from the fire, but nothing I'd rave about  Bone in ribeye: Best steak I've ever had! Cooked and seasoned simply, letting the meat be the real star. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and rested perfectly!! No blood or juice running out all over the plate. Amazing flavor and tenderness!  Potatoes: the ones it comes with, good little potatoes  Onion rings: Best I've ever had!!! Great flavor, seasoned to perfection, maybe a bit on the spicy side for non spicy eaters. Served hot out of the frier. Very crispy (they do lose some crunch as they get cooler, but I didn't mind) and the dipping sauce was phenomenal too.  Banana bread pudding, so good! The sauce on the bottom and bruleed banana slices were fantastic.  Overall: A phenomenal meal, pretty reasonable prices by Vegas famous chef standards. I'm now very excited to try craft steak next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "We had a great experience at Heritage Steak and will be back the next time we're in Vegas.  My husband and I started with the smoked pork terrine and the grilled octopus.  We didn't love the terrine, as it was very \"crumbly\" and hard to spread--not what we were expecting. The grilled octopus was very good and well-prepared. For the main course, we split the filet, since it was 10 oz (we are used to each having a 6 oz portion). We also ordered a side of the spicy onion rings.  The steak was very well prepared and the onion rings were absolutely delicious--I couldn't stop eating them.  I subtracted one star for the terrine and for some service hiccups (which are somewhat understandable given that the restaurant opened less than a month ago).  I ordered a club soda and lime (my go-to drink because I don't drink alcohol).  I got the club soda pretty quickly, but I had to flag down our server to ask for the lime, and I still did't get it until after the appetizers were served. I had nearly finished my club soda by then (and club soda doesn't taste that great without a lime). When a restaurant charges by the glass (club soda, like diet coke, comes in separate bottles and you're charged for each one), making the exact drink that the customer wants is especially important.",

Our appetizers, bone marrow with lobster and corn and the pork/foie gras terrine was spectacular. Our heritage steaks and sides (particularly the creamless cream corn) were fantastic. Amazing cocktails and an excellent wine list. Our dessert of peach gillette with peach ice cream was heavenly.  Our biggest complaint? The acoustics.  The restaurant is in the \"jungle\" dome in the entry of The Mirage and the noise, sound intrusion, echoey background music really ruined an atmosphere that was practically perfect.",

Look, this place is fine/good in the general way that you are going to get a premium cut of meat cooked very well at nearly any nice steak house in Vegas, but there's nothing that special here.  The problem with being a steakhouse by Colicchio at the same price point more or less as Craftsteak is that you are going to get compared to Craft.  This restaurant doesn't have the highlights and secrets that Craft has.  24 hour short-rib for $39 at Craft and kobe skirt at $79 are both fantastic deals at Craft this place doesn't have a lot of competition there, nor does it have the A5 wagyu highlights, amazing monkey bread, lobster pots, and the bartending/cocktails are pretty much strictly worse also.   In the end, this place measures up fine compared to other strip steak joints, but Craft is essentially the same price and executes pretty much everything better.",

    "text": "I have to tell you all, I picked a horrible year to quit eating beef.  Last Saturday night found me and my BGE in Vegas for UFC 196 Nate versus Connor. I had given up watching MMA years ago but duty called because I was hosting some VIP customers to the fights, and so it was back to the bloody octagon again for me .   I left dinner up to the VIPs and of course, what do they always pick?   That's right, Steak, every time. :)  But if one must eat beef, Heritage is the place to fall off the wagon. And if you're going to go beef, you better go big.   I wound up going with the 14oz New York cut and it was all that I wanted from a steak.  I ordered it medium and it came out exactly that--perfect grill lines, soft and juicy. The only reason I'm deducting a star here is because I went with the octopus appetizer on recommendation by our waiter, and I could barely stomach it--and I like octopus. It was bitter, fishy, and just all-around nasty. In fact I was so put off by that appetizer, that it nearly ruined my perfect steak afterwards.  It literally left a horrible flavor in my mouth.  The side dishes were decent, but the caramelized onions were a bit over the top on the baked potatoes.  But unlike Connor who tapped out to Nate, I definitely will be back again, but next time I'm absolutely avoiding the octopus. i think the safest bet is just order a steak and fries and you should be fine...",

It's not cheap, but it's quality above and beyond.  Our waiter, Kim, was off the chart great with his knowledge and personal attention.  He explained everything very well, which is important when you're making a Wagyu choice.  When I asked what wine he would suggest, he poured me two samples so I could pick what I liked, nice touch.  The food was outstanding all around.  From the homemade beef jerky they provide as a starter, cheddar biscuits, pork belly appetizer with spring onion kimchee, the wagyu beef that thinking about it still makes my mouth water with shishito peppers, prime rib for DH with an outstanding horseradish sauce, and a scoop of strawberry ginger sorbet to end the meal, wow, it was worth every penny to me.  Thank you Kim and everyone else.  I can't wait to come back.",

First I arrived for my reservation 15 minutes early and was told they were seating on time and to come back in 15 minutes. I arrived back at 6:45 for my reservation of 2. I was told it would be a few minutes. I was seated at 7:00. We were seated in the side bar area right next to the bar with TVs. We ordered right after the couple next to us. They had finished eating and we still hadn't received our meal. My wife and I both ordered The 10 oz filet medium. When we did get our meal hers was rare in the middle.

They grill over open flame and use different types of wood for different cuts and types of meat.  The steak was grilled perfectly and the smokey flavour was really delicious and not like anything I've tasted elsewhere.  We selected a number of sides, all of which were good but nothing really special.  Overall it was a really good experience.  Just wish the ambiance was a little more intimate.",

But, they are two completely different menus, so it's not a fair comparison.   The bone marrow with lobster appetizer was fantastic. The chilled shrimp and charred octopus were also fine.   We each had different cuts of steak: ribeye, filet, and Tabasco rubbed skirt steak, which is very very spicy!! All were cooked perfectly but my ribeye had so much excessive fat than most (especially at $52).    The service and ambiance was just fine as well. For $500 for three people with no dessert, I was expecting wow, but just got very good. It's just missing something. Could be the vibe and festive mood that you get at craftsteak, whereas Heritage Steak is more subdued. I think.   Now their lounge bar and new lounge food menu was lots of fun. Thank you Trevor, for being a great and friendly bartender. Appreciate your service!",

The ambiance was perfect, the staff super friendly. Our server was James and he was wonderful.   We started with the seafood tower for 4, while the presentation & quality were very good-the portion didn't seem to be for 4, but no complaints otherwise.  Side dish-onion rings are fantastic, hand cut fries were dry & flavorless.   The main courses: steak dish was of course amazing, salmon dish was quoted as \"the best they ever had\", two ducks: one was perfect, the second undercooked & extremely fatty, Swordfish was over cooked & appeared more like a smashed chicken breast piece, and lastly speaking of the farm fresh chicken that was ordered-it wasn't rubbery but that is the best I can stay -flavorless, overcooked, pathetically small piece of chicken with no root vegetables served. A cafeteria serves better chicken than at Heritage Steak.   We paid over $700 for 3 great dishes. We were really expecting so much more. Our advice would be to only order steak at this steak restaurant. For non-steak eaters you truly are gambling. We crapped out on this one.",

I thought both of them were a tad salty! The beef tartare was very well-seasoned and the kimchi was a surprisingly nice touch, but I still prefer the more traditional spin at Craftsteak. I also liked the octopus, especially the jalapeno and roasted peppers. Beware that this dish is a little spicy!  Our server explained the difference between the main course and heritage steaks, since both are similar. The main course dishes are composed dishes meant to stand alone as an entree, while the heritage steak is just the steak. If you wanted sides, you could order them and share family style. We got one of each: the grilled ribeye and the kobe skirt. The skirt was my favorite of the two (probably could have guessed that...).   The food here is good, I just think the Chef's other restaurant is better!",

This is simply an experience that must be handed down and shared with others. It is not sinful. It is not overindulgence. It is simply greatness that needs to be experienced.

They are so in touch with their food, exude the epitome of knowledgeable hospitality........ hell.... they simply know their shit.  I've had their wonderfully delectable seafood platter (to be shared with the table), sampled almost all of their top steaks (even though I'm not generally a fan of wagyu), the amazing sides (you simply MUST get the mushrooms, whipped/mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts), and if you have room for it...... anything they recommend for dessert.

    "text": "My thoughts about Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak are about how good the appetizer was and how ordinary the rest of the meal was.  I wanted to try one of the heritage steaks but when I didn't want the bone in 18 ounce ribeye--just too much food--and my server suggested I go with the regular ribeye, a smaller cut.  For a starter I ordered the charred octopus that's so highly recommended by the reviews.  For dessert, I had to try the S'mores Fritters.  I was brought a bottle of still water in a Heritage Steak labeled bottle.  There was no charge for bottled water as I feared.  I also ordered an iced tea.  Both drinks were a bit slow in being brought but it was OK_I was in no hurry.  A runner also brought me a bread basked of two rolls and a small plate with a round of butter with cracked salt on half of the round.  The appetizer was superb!  The appetizer size was just right and the octopus was perfectly cooked.  It had a nice zing to it from the red peppers that were on top.  It was a grand way to start the meal.  My steak came next and I was taken aback by the way it looked.  Here was a nice piece of beef that had a glop of something on it.  As it turned out, it onion-balsamic relish and roasted onions, but it looked so odd.  I wondered who came up with this plating idea.  I had asked for the steak to be cooked blue.  The server asked if I wanted it charred on each side blue or just blue and not charred.  I wanted just blue.  It was cooked beyond this and it soon went to a medium rare rather than even rare.    For dessert I had the S'mores fritters.  This was an OK dessert but there was nothing special about the deconstructed S'more.  It's a cute idea, but what it turns out to be are three doughnut hole-like chocolate rounds, several dots of marshmallow that are flamed brownish, and some gelato on Graham cracker crumbs.  The gelato was supposed to be Graham cracker flavor, but it really had little flavor of its own.  The taste of Graham came from the crumbs beneath the gelato.    Service was generally very good.  Someone was around to refill my water glass with the bottled water and dirty plates were removed quickly.  The only hiccup was a wait for a second iced tea.  I was underwhelmed by the meal.  It was OK and the appetizer was more than that.  It just wasn't up to the highest standards I would expect of this celebrity chef.  End of review and beginning of side story:  After I took a photo of something during the early part of my meal, I noticed a flash go off in my direction and a woman had snapped my photo with her iPhone.  She was with a party of four and she said she wanted a photo of someone really enjoying their job.  Later when my meal was complete, she came over and sat across from me and asked if I was a food critic or a \"Yelpie.\"  I proudly stated that I was a Yelpie.  She then went on to talk about the meal and ask my thoughts.  When I pretty much said what I wrote here, she talked about her steak which was supposed to medium rare came out raw.  She sent it back and the second one was correct.  I had noticed that she was eating while her husband and the other couple had finished and their plates were cleared.  She suggested that I try the Cowboy Steak at another restaurant, one very close to Heritage Steak.  The four of them thought it was a great steak.  End of side story.",

The first steak was worth about $10.00 and the flat iron about $15.00. Very disappointed. Denny's probably has better steaks. We paid $573.00 for four of us (including a bottle of The Prisoner wine for $105. It cost $35 in the store and the night before we paid $85.00 in another restaurant) and it may have been worth about half. This is not a steakhouse at all.  Tom should be ashamed to have his name on this restaurant.  What a disappointment. Stay away from this place if you are looking for a great steak (Ribeye). The onion rings were good. Wedge salad was horrible and they didn't even offer fresh pepper. I asked and they gave me a small mill to do it myself. Too many great restaurants in Las Vegas to choose from and this is not on of them. Not Top Chef :(",

Fortunately we spent that with a fabulous bartender (gal with red hair - forgot name but AWESOME) and then off to the table. This is a very (very) loud restaurant, very tight seating. We sat next to a large expense account table and the primary form of communication seemed to be shouting. Obviously, it's Vegas and this is no fault of the restaurant, but if you are looking for date experience - look elsewhere. The table staff were quite nice and engaging. Bread was kind of a cornbread muffin, I didn't care for it, but others might. This is a \"steak on a plate\" type of joint, everything costs extra. My date got the Filet and it was perfect - steakhouses always seem to under cook by one temp grade, but the waiter can talk you through it. I went Prime Rib, and it was fine but surprisingly flavor free on the outside. Perhaps that's the chef's style but I am used to Rib encrusted with rock salt and pepper. We did try the side of Risotto and Twice Baked - both were a waste of money. All in all, this is an average and Vegas priced steak house but I have to call out the wonderful staff.",

    "text": "Big fans of Colicchio restaurants. Been very much looking forward to trying out Heritage at Mirage. Good/mediocre/bad news.   Good first:  Steak. Our group of 3 each selected a different cut of meat. Each steak was perfectly prepared and delicious. Not overly done, rare where we wanted it. 14oz NY Strip, 18oz ribeye, and 4oz Wagyu were all perfect. Grade A.   The room is beautiful and tastefully modern without being overdone. Reminiscent of Craft Steak. Beautiful architecture and design touches that successfully remove you from the casino setting. A.   Sides fine. Nothing remarkable but ok. Desserts: tasty if not terribly interesting ice creams. Toasted marshmallow was a standout.   Mediocre: Apps: beef tartare was ok: B. Hamachi ceviche overly watery and too much citrus: C. Grilled romaine: B-  Bad:  Wine list completely inaccessible and over-priced. Going into a fine dining experience like a Colicchio restaurant, one must expect an expensive meal. We're fine with that. But there were exactly 3 bottles of either Pinot Noir or Cabernet under $100. That's insane. A good wine program should include the big ticket items, sure... But should also offer affordable, quality bottles in a reasonable price range. Big disappointment.   The bottle we settled on was a nice Russian River Pinot at $80, which was ok. B+  Service was fine. Nothing bad. Nothing remarkable: B  Overall:  The mix of good, bad, and indifferent food & wine all rather didn't matter when the tab was presented. A $500+ meal for 3 with a single bottle of wine and no cocktails should be mind-blowing. We should have been thrilled to spend the money on an extraordinary experience. The opposite happened. The high ticket made us question the value of what we had just eaten, and like it less than we should have. A let down.   Grade C.  Doubtful we'll return.",

It had the right dressing, and the cherry tomatoes, but Romaine lettuce instead of baby greens.  The steak was excellent and was definitely the high point of the meal. The sauteed mushrooms were extremely salty, and the apple ricotta fritter dessert was extremely bland.  I felt bad for the staff, because clearly they were understaffed. It took a long time to get service and to get my food. But that's when the staff, and especially the manager, should go out of their way to make up for the deficiency.",

My wife and daughter were over half way done with their dinner by the time the second steak was on the table. The hostess apologized as well as the manager, however no compensation was offered. I  would not spend the money to eat there again. There is no way I could comprehend spending over $200 for a meal that was lack-luster. Btw, per my wife, the lobster thermidor was a little bland. If they would like to respond to this post, I would be happy to hear from them.",

    "text": "Am wondering after reading the other reviews if we went on an off night or perhaps I ate at a different place but I expected better from a restaurant that is owned by a famous chef.  while the staff was friendly and since we had reservations we were seated immediately, it sort of went down hill from there.  We were there on CHristmas day which might have meant they were short staffed but our server seemed flustered and there wasn't a lot of personal attention that you expect in a four or five star establishment.  The menu isn't huge and of course runs primarily to red meat but they do have a couple of fish dishes.  I asked about the lobster dish only to be told that the chef only ordered a couple of lobsters so they were out.  Sorry, that's insane on a busy holiday.  Ended up ordering the special of the day which was goose.  It was nicely cooked and served on a bed of sauteed red cabbage with a side of brussel sprouts.  I adore spouts, these weren't good.  My hubbie ordered a steak medium, it's an old argument we have about over cooking, and he said it was very dry.  This is one of the place that you have to order sides separately and they are for sharing.  So he got fries which were enough for four people.  Had they been a little hotter they would have been amazing, as it was they were just ok.   I watch the chef owner on Top Chef making comments about the contestants  Would love to be able to comment to him about his dishes but guess that won't happen.  Since we go to Vegas a lot and always stay at the Mirage, we'll probably give it another try to see if the holiday was a contributing factor.",

I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the decor with all the wood.  How fitting for the theme of it all with the natural ingredients and way of cooking.  The service was superb as to be expected.  We started with the beef tartare and I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was and the nice pairing with mushrooms and veggies.  It only comes with two pieces of bread which if didn't think was enough to distribute evenly while allowing you to savor the actual appetizer.  You could always use the complimentary bread but it's just never the same.  I had the Kobe beef and WOW, I'm speechless... Cutting it was like slicing butter and the beef just burst with tenderness and juicy goodness.  I had one of the specialty cocktails with strawberry and it ended up being very disappointing.  The waiter noticed I barely drank it and went ahead and took it off the bill which was super sweet!  Overall, awesome, not as good as craft but still holds it own!",

Our group of 4 ordered the french onion soup and pork belly to start, both awesome, get the pork belly if you are a fan.  The steaks and chicken we ordered were cooked to perfection over the wood fired grill.  Mushrooms, brocoli and carrots were super delicious sides.  I loved the flavors and service.

I was truly expecting to be served by career servers with in depth knowledge of the menu. Our server was nice but missed a few things here and there.   As a table we ordered a little bit of everything. Started with the chilled seafood platter (amazing) also tried the fried oysters and pork belly. This dish was outstanding. Perfectly composed and prepared. Not a drip or crumb left on the plate.   I had the ribeye cooked medium. Again perfectly prepared. Simple preparation with some roasted potatoes.   A friend had the Kobe skirt steak, never expecting much from a skirt steak but holy crap! Amazing. Perfectly cooked again. So much flavor. They use a tobasco and pepper dry rub on it. Outstanding. All in all it was truly one of the best meals we've had in Vegas.   Price point is a bit high but I did like that it drove away a lot of rif-raf and really the people eating here were all foodies looking to see what Chef Colicchio had done differently than Craftsteak.",

I ordered the Beer Salad and my husband ordered Oysters. There was a couple who was seated after us and they already got their entrees! The waitress came by with the manager before we even said anything. The manager came and apologized and said we have them working on your food ASAP! The waitress DEFINITELY forgot to put our order in. She didn't even come by to acknowledge her mistake. She had to send her manager right away. I'm giving this place 3 stars because of this. You're a \"high-end\" restaurant. You should never make that mistake of forgetting to put in an order. Anyway, I ordered the Scallops with a side of Brussels Sprouts and my husband ordered a Ribeye with mashed potatoes. My scallops were delicious! So we're the Brussels sprouts and the mashed potatoes. I tried some of the steak and eh, it was okay. SAM, the gentleman that brought our food over was terrific! He explained all the sauces for the oysters thoroughly and was just amazing! He deserves 50 stars!!! The waitress, 0 stars! I didn't get her name unfortunately. Bad experience, good food (pricey). I won't be back again because of this experience.",

I let my friends choose the place, but with Tom Colicchio on the sign, I knew i'd be getting quality. I didn't veer too far away from my comfort zone. Having the Heirloom Tomato Salad with a subtle Lemon Basil Vinaigrette, the Corn Chowder (with bacon of course) and the Prime Rib.  Simple dishes made to taste divine! It's harder to impress people with a few simple ingredients than to overwhelm the tastebuds with too many flavors. A great steak house like this understands food cooked perfectly will always taste better than dishes that taste more like the seasoning than the main ingredient.   A friend of mine had some crazy Lobster dish that I was envious of...but normally i don't get seafood when i travel inland. Maybe next time i'll make an exception.   The server was great helping us with wine pairing and pre-dinner cocktail choices. Everything was just as it should be for a good vacation night out...we did pay Vegas prices for it, but it was worth the cost.",

We were created by the hostess and seated promptly. The tables are a little tight for the 2 tops so if you are wanting an intimate dining experience this will not be your place.   The wait staff were simply amazing. Our water was always full. They started with a basket of amazing biscuits that melted in your mouth.   Our menu consisted of the following: Wedge salads- yummy. Blue cheese dressing was perfect with the pickled onions. Great flavor.   Filet Mignon-one of the best steaks I have ever had.   Side of mushrooms- perfect pairing with the steak plenty to share.   Baked potato-a little lack luster in flavor but still good. Big enough to share.   We added the side of shrimp. My husband loved it.   I added the side of crab legs and I have to say these were my favorite by far. Already cracked. Melted in your mouth. Delicious.   Then since it is our honeymoon they brought us out some ice cream. We were so full but this was so sweet of them and it was Soo good.   We loved our dining experience here.",

I think everyone was sharing our table. I swear we were checked on atleast 10 times during the meal, so that was a little annoying. Still, very nice. I have a family member that lives in Japan.

We ordered the filet and the flat iron chimichurri steaks and sides were wild mushrooms and also truffle risotto. All was cooked really, really well to our liking and personal asking. My grandmother was given the full treatment for her birthday as well....no extra charges...but that's not why I'm kissing a*hole. Not sure what the complaints were and what's crazy is...I was about to switch my reservation based on the reviews as of late. I am so grateful I stuck with my reservation here. In my personal experience, give it a shot ladies and gents. This place was knocking us out of the park with flavor, service and originality.   Will be returning for sure. Maybe others went on an off night, and not sure how they easily spend $500 and were sooo not happy on two peeps; my Gma and I splurged on fancy steaks and two sides and a bottle of wine and with tip for an amazing experience restaurant and we were at $240. Give it a shot for a splurge event. I'm gnawing on my leftovers over my sink as I write this....sauce dripping down my elbow like the fancy lady I am!",

My girl had the duck it was super fatty which sometimes is norm with duck but it tasted sour . Manager did take it off our bill which was cool. I had the rack of lamb , which was tough and ridiculously over priced @ $68 for 2 pieces of charred lamb.. wouldn't be rushing back here in a hurry. There's much better options in Vegas",

It got busier as the night progressed but impressively, the wait staff got even more attentive. The sommelier was welcoming and not snooty (big pet peeve, those snooty sommeliers) and helped us pick some great wine and nice glasses of champagne.  And their portions are humongous. We shared that prime rib and a couple of sides and neither of us could finish our portions (that NEVER happens). Overall, a fun night at a good steakhouse. DJ Tommy C doesn't disappoint!",

Unfortunately, we were not famished but in the mood for a light meal or snack. The ladies, however, had the taste for steak.  Tom Colicchio's was there and we seized the day and grabbed a table.  Service was top notch and the Dirty Martinis were superb.  That Lady had the filet and baked potato.  I tried the Duck breast with chorizo and it was delicious. Our friends went for scallops and the bone in ribeye.  Overall the room, service, food and wine list are delightful.  As a steakhouse this place deserves a second visit when everyone is really hungry.  By the way they make a great espresso.",

    "text": "This upscale steakhouse has a nice, candlelit ambience for a romance dinner right before being blown away by the Beatles LOVE show. I really appreciate how promptly they were at seating us and changing out our used utensils and plates.  It was strange to see beef jerky on the table but it wasn't too hard and it tasted good. Love how freshly served the poblano cheese biscuits were. The server gave us a nice fresh new batch when our basket was empty.  I wanted something healthy and fresh for my starter so I got the baby beet and I love how tangy and refreshing it was. It's an acquired taste to like beets. If you haven't had beets or beet juice before, you probably won't like this dish.  I got the prime rib medium rare and it was delicious. For how expensive it was, the portion was pretty darn big. My boyfriend had the fillet mignon and I hated it when I tried it. It tasted a bit burnt and the cumcuirri sauce tasted like armpits to me. Yea, not a fan of that sauce. Luckily for my boyfriend, he thought it tasted good.  For dessert, I settled for a scoop of Yuzu grapefruit sorbet, which tasted like a True grapefruit - nice and citrusy but kind of unpleasantly bitter.",

    "text": "Not a bad place for a meal; it was all really just A-OK for me.  Nothing spectacular, but they served our large party with friendly and expeditious service.  That fact alone makes up half of the dining equation.  As for the food ...  We started with the Shellfish Tower and split it all along the table.  I think we had maybe 17 people, and we all devoured it.  Standard fare - lobster, shrimp, oysters.  Everyone seemed to love it.  Some appetizers made the rounds:  charred octopus (nice), pork belly (also nice).  I only had a bite of each as I didn't want to go overboard - because a STEAK was coming, that's why.  Hubby chose the Wagyu flatiron with chimichurri, which he said was cooked very well.  I had the filet, and I thought it was great.  We split a bunch of sides and there were differing opinions on the truffle risotto - I loved it more than anyone, but I love truffle AND risotto, so I knew this would be no exception.  It did need a touch more seasoning, but I was still okay with it for the most part.  The creamy kale had excellent flavor, but I guess some people tasted burnt parts.  I never did, but maybe they got the edges or something?  The brussel sprouts were super good - excellent color and char.  The free rolls were nothing special, but they did give you a piece of house made jerky which was a nice touch.  Anyway, we all had a nice time.  Food was good, but not mind-blowing amazing.  We probably won't go back considering all the food options LV has to offer.  However, if you are a steakhouse fan, it might be worth looking into at least once.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner since my friend and I were going to catch the Cirque du Soleil Beatles later in the evening. It's the July 4th weekend so everywhere seemed to be packed full, but I managed to make a reservation here for 2 at 7pm. I was a bit nervous reading some of the reviews here and had several bouts of second thoughts, and almost canceled our reservation to go elsewhere. However, we're very glad we stuck to it and came here after all.  Located near the Mirage Hotel entrance, right below the atrium, we were met by a lone hostess out front....we were actually 15 minutes early for our reservation, but not a problem.....we were seated right away. You don't get a good view of the restaurant itself as the front portion is hidden by the bar and a few tables right by the casino. As we were led to the back where the actual restaurant is, we were very impressed as to how spacious, cool, and classy the decor was.....very upscale casual dining atmosphere, and good enough for a pleasant business, group, or romantic dinner.  We were told by the hostess who our server would be, but there seemed to be 2 or 3 others who attended to us.....everybody being very friendly and helpful, and not rude and snobbish at all. Our server took our drink orders.....since I didn't want to get too buzzed during the show, I decided not to drink tonight....my friend ordered a glass of wine....some complimentary snacks were also brought out shortly after.....hot and fresh Cheesy Bun and some beef jerky.....the bread was really yummy and my friend said the jerky was very good.   I had already taken a quick look at the menu online and had an idea what I was going to order. I noticed that many of the negative reviews on here were about the steaks....well, thank goodness I don't eat beef! ....my friend does, but she decided on something different for once. And, based on other yelpers' recommendations we had to order the spicy onion rings!  For mains, I ordered the Wood Fired Farm Chicken and my friend ordered the half order Lobster Thermidor. I didn't know how large the portion sizes of sides were going to be, but I had to try as many as I could as I didn't know when I'd ever get to try them again. So, I went ahead and ordered the Mixed Baby Greens Salad, Heritage Crab and Corn Chowder, Roasted Mushrooms, Spicy Onion Rings, and Creamed Tuscan Kale.  Everything was absolutely delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the chowder....so full and flavor and perfect consistency. My chicken was perfectly roasted......so tender and juicy, and that sauce that it came with was oh so good! As you can probably guess by now, we ordered too much and couldn't finish the sides. All of it was oh so good and delicious, but the creamed kale was pretty heavy and hard to eat a lot of when we had already ordered so much food. Those onion rings were excellent!......we had to push ourselves to make sure we didn't waste it. I honestly couldn't stand up after all this.....but my friend and I decided that it may be a good idea to walk around the casino floor a few times before the show....so we did.   As for the prices.....are people really complaining about high prices of famous celebrity chef restaurants....on the strip in Vegas...in 2017?!?!? I think it was worth every cent of the $210 I forked out for this dinner, and I'd come back for more. If you think this place is expensive then I would be more than happy to give you directions to the nearest Taco Bell.....perhaps you can find better value there?",

    "text": "Sooooo.....  I have waited 7 months to write this review.  I really needed to cool off.  My wife and I both had the Wagyu Ribeye last year and it was phenomenal!  This year, not so much.  First, Amy was our waitress last year and we were lucky to have her again this year.  She was awesome.  The Steak:  When you drop $500 on a meal, you expect awesomeness; you don't expect to spend the evening trying to determine which way you need to face the porcelain throne.  Having eaten the best meal of my here life last year, I tried to push through what was an ill prepared steak.  It was black and crispy on the outside and way too salty.  I kept thinking it would get better.  It never did and I should have complained on the spot.  My wife says I'm too nice.  The next day, having cleansed my system, I called the steak house and complained.  I was asked to come downstairs to talk to someone.  That someone was a member of the hotel's security.  He was a gentleman and seemed to understand I was there with a real complaint.  What I got from the manager was \"no body else has reported an issue\" attitude.  Well, I had an issue and I was not there trying to get a free meal.  I had reservations that night at this same restaurant planning to spend another $500 for another Wagyu Steak.  FAT CHANCE!  My treatment was so bad, I canceled my reservation on the way out.  They could have cared less.  I am deeply disappointed in the manager's handling of my complaint.  Do yourself a favor, find some place else to have a Wagyu.  Even if you are planning to have a dry aged steak, go somewhere else!",

FOOD: *Beef Tartare ($19) - Though not prepared the traditional way, the dish was deliciously different.  The beef tartare was tender and creamy and topped with bok choy kimchi and pickled beech mushrooms.  Though it had bok choy kimchi, the dish wasn't spicy, not even the slightest kick.  My only complaint that it was served with only two pieces of toasted bread.  *Kobe Skirt ($45) - Delicious!  The 10 oz steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I could definitely taste the wooden charcoal taste.  Do note that the steaks are served with a side of potatoes.  If we knew, we wouldn't have ordered a side of fries.  SERVICE: Great.  Our waiter was well knowledgeable on the menu and went into detail explaining everything.

I went 30 mins early because my husband was tied up with some work and I was starving and needed to get an appetizer.   They seated me early but the service was off from the get go. The waiter kept asking if I wanted a cocktail (I'm pregnant so I declined) and he seemed disappointed with that answer. Then I explained that I was waiting for my husband but was starving and wanted to get an appetizer now and he'd join me in a bit. He seemed again confused and said that the appetizers can take 30 mins but that if I needed to be fed, he was there to help. Um...ok. So I ordered a cold dish (Shrimp Cocktail for $27!) and got it within 5 mins. It was ok- nothing special at all- especially not for $27. I was expecting something a bit more exciting but no.  Then my husband arrived and we split:  Pork Belly appetizer: I admit I'm not a pork belly fan but this was particularly uninspired and just pure fat.  10 oz. Filet Mignon: perfectly cooked- excellent  Lobster Hushpuppy side: Nothing special at all- even a little dry. Wouldn't recommend  Onion Ring side: Amazing. I only ordered these because of the Yelp reviews and I'm glad i did. Highly recommend!  Manhattan Cocktail: My husband said his Manhattan was a bit sweet but great overall  Desert Tasting: small bites of 3 appetizers- yummy and the perfect 3-6 bites per person of desert",

I respect Chef Colicchio, but I don't think this represents great food. It was OK food at an OK price.  The ambiance in the middle of the Mirage was nice. Most people felt like it was too casual with all of the tourists surrounding the area, but it had a unique feeling to be eating in the glass dome. We were seated and presented with the menu. I ordered the tri tip and my bf ordered a steak. We also ordered a side of the Spicy Onion Rings (it was highly recommended on Yelp) and the soup that came with a bread pudding of some sort.  The appetizer was bone marrow and this was probably the best dish overall. Bone marrow with apple, I would have never imagined that this combination would be so good.  Next was the onion rings...very..meh. They were tempura deep fried onion rings with a spicy dipping sauce. I could have ordered this anywhere and it was very underwhelming.   The bread pudding was odd. It wasn't good...it wasn't terrible...it just tasted weird and had a weird texture. We both took a bite out of this souffle-bread pudding thing and that was it. Enough of that stuff.  My tri tip was good and came with a dollop of mustard. It was cooked well and very tender. The flavors didn't dazzle my taste buds but it was a decent piece of meat.  I want to try other Tom Collichio's joints but I probably won't go back here. It is overpriced for some mediocre food inside of a casino. It sounds like just any other restaurant on the strip.",

I ordered the NY Strip, medium and risotto and it was cooked just right (pretty pink middle, crisp/perfectly charred exterior) and was very flavorful and juicy.   The risotto was fantastic. Very rich though. I usually don't use a sauce on my steak, but they give you a small plate with three sauces and thought I'd try the horse radish based sauce.  Wow!  Delicious!!!     It was pricey. And it could be that service and good quality is spotty (based on reviews), but I must've caught them on a good night.  It was great!",

    "text": "For the price this place is a complete waste of time and money, there are so many other amazing restaurants in Las Vegas, including fabulous steak houses, save your multiple hundred dollars and don't go here.   After watching every season of Top Chef I thought that from Tom Colicchio's restaurant I could expect 2 things 1. perfectly seasoned food 2. great service, neither of which we got. Its ironic how he is so stern on the contestants about just a hair too much or too little salt when all of our veggie came out triple salted. It was so salty no on could eat more than 1 bite.   Our server never came around to ever ask if the food was okay or not, or we would have told him nothing was good. But he was happy to show up 1 hour later after we flagged 3 people down trying to get our waiters attention and just pick up our full plates and not even bother asking why we hadn't eaten a thing.   The drinks took over 45 minutes to show up (that is just the first round, needless to say no one ordered another). For all of us to get our entrees out it took 30 minutes, so we were all waiting around staring at each other while our server was never to be found to ask where the rest of the entrees were. Our server completely forgot about us and our food! We had to keep on asking him where certain dishes were and then they would show up 20-25 minutes later, clearly he never put it in to begin with.   The only good thing was the $100 ($25/oz; 4oz minimum order) wagyu that my husband got, but if you can't get a $100 dish right - close down now.   Overall, the drinks were bad, the food (other than the steak) was bad and the service was terrible. We would have had a much better experience eating at the Mirage food court rather than coming here, and we wouldn't have wasted over $100 per person. After spending so much we all left hungry and frustrated.   Sorry Tom, I thought you were amazing and your restaurant would show us how food is meant to be cooked and eaten, but I guess there is a reason why we got last minute reservations on a Saturday night at 8pm while there were 2 tradeshows in town. Clearly we aren't the only ones who feel this way.",

I started with the bone marrow, which was served topped with lobster claw meat and apple shreds...also amazing.  Everything was perfectly cooked, and I couldn't imagine a more perfect pairing.  Eating solo, I took a seat at the bar and ordered a Speakeasy Prohibition Ale, while paired very well with my meal.  The bartender was a cute girl with dyed red hair, a cute butt in her tight black pants.  They keep it classy here, with all servers wearing white button-ups, but there was no hiding the huge rack on the bartender who served me for the night.  She looked subtly great, knowing that she was only being conservative for the venue.  She did a great job... my glass was never empty for more than a few moments.  The girls serving the floor wear more revealing outfits, and they are absolute knockouts.  If you are going out with your wife or someone special, you better not get caught looking!",

    "text": "Please save your money and do not go here. This place is a very mediocre steakhouse. If you are staying at the Mirage obviously it is convenient if you wanted a piece of steak however it is not for those with exquisite culinary tastes.   I was staying at Mirage during EDC weekend - which by the way was not my idea to be staying at the lowly Mirage. I'm usually a Cosmo kind of guy. But I had let my friends planned the trip. Also it was not my idea to dined here either - it was my friend's last minute decision. Never in a million years would I be going here on my own volition.  The food was simply bad for Vegas steakhouse standard. Service was even worse. We were a party of 11 --8 adults and 3 children so needless to say the 20% gratuity was added to the bill. In my eyes the wait staff and our main waiter deserved nothing... And since they knew that we were a large group they did not care because they would  earn their tip automatically.   Here were some of the issues...  When they first brought  out the house bread  it was all very cold. We asked for the bread  to be warmed up. Our waiter went away, appeared to check with another employee and then came back...the waiter's response? \"Oh sorry we don't  have a microwave....\" I was thinking is this guy  for real? News flash: You don't warm up bread using a microwave. You use either a conventional oven or a convection oven like a toaster oven. SMFH. Being a party of 11 we had to sit in a long horizonal table and of course they only brought out two baskets of bread and...three sets of butter. It would have made more sense for three baskets?  Another sticking point that I have - our waiter sold us on the Onion soup. He had mentioned that it took about 8 hours to cook and was one of their most popular items on the menu. So of course we ordered five of these and they arrived tasting horrendous..it was like something that came from Progresso.   For the most part,  folks in my party order filets, ribeyes, lambs, seabasses, etc. Everything was just very salty.  You know you're in for service nightmare when you ask one waiter for A1 and they come back saying \"we don't have it\" and then you ask another waiter and they actually bring it out for you. Ridiculous!!!  Mirage please close this place down and open a real steakhouse. Hell maybe partner up with Capital Grille or Flemings or something  - we would  have had a much more pleasant  experience at those places.",

While none of the food was horrible, none of it was excellent. The steak was decent, but slightly overcooked, the meat quality was just OK, it wasn't as good as craftsteak.  Great waiters, good wine selection. The port selection was decent, but not as good as other locations. The Mirage is a bit beat up, and thankfully you didn't have to venture too deep considering it's right at the front door.  I will stick to craftsteak, but this is a decent choice.",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant;  we had never eaten here, nor did we know anything about it, prior to our visit.  It is located in the same hotel/casino as the Beatles \"Love\" show (another recommendation if you like the Beatles!), so we decided to have a steak dinner prior to the show.  Boy, was that ever a great decision!!  We surveyed the wine menu first - I will warn you, most of their wines are very expensive (one I saw was five figures - most are three and four figures), but they DO have a smattering of under-$100 bottles to choose from, so don't be put off by that.  Their on-site sommelier was knowledgeable, charming, and sociable - we had a great discussion before settling on a red wine.  Then to the menu... Oh, the menu.  The menu alone will make you drool - multiple cuts of steak available, as well as a great sampling of seafood, or surf-and-turf if that's your preference.  The side dishes are a la carte, which (frankly) we expected.  Our waiter (Farzad) was attentive, polite, and downright funny - the three of us hit it off smashingly well, and he struck just the right balance between attentive and smothering.  We both wanted the bone-in ribeye;  he suggested that, since we both wanted the same cut of meat cooked the same way, that we simply order the 32-ounce bone-in, dry-aged, and they would split it for us.  He mentioned that was his favorite thing to get when he visits the restaurant with his wife or his friend - that was a rousing recommendation, in our opinion - to have a waiter who voluntarily visits his place of employment for a meal!  He also recommended that the steak be cooked medium - as both of us prefer medium-rare, that gave us brief pause for thought, but we decided to abide by the recommendation.  I am glad we did!  That steak was cooked to sublime perfection - juicy, tender - like butter, cutting it.  The flavor was outstanding, the sear perfect, and the side dishes we chose (smoked Gouda scalloped potatoes, and mushrooms) were simply ideal.  All steaks are served with three dipping sauces, so to speak - creamed horseradish, chimichurri, and tamarind sauce (think A1, but more tangy).  We did sample the three sauces to see what they tasted like, but honestly, the steak needed no help - the juices on the plate were the perfect \"dip\"!  Backing up a bit, we tried the oysters for an appetizer - they have a sort of grapefruit sauce on them, are served with grilled avocado slices, and were marvelous!  We did also each have a salad - both salads were very good, too.  I wish I could speak to the dessert quality, but after salad, oysters, steak, mushrooms, and potatoes, plus red wine, we had NO room left!!  We did survey the dessert menu, and they have a very quirky and unique range of options, including some traditional standbys (chocolate cheesecake, for example).  I'm quite sure, given the quality of the dinner we had, that the desserts would be excellent as well.  Surprisingly, even though we were next to the casino on a Sunday night at 1700, the restaurant somehow managed to be intimate and much quieter than I would have expected.  Seating is very cozy, and very comfortable.  Bottom line?  Waitstaff is excellent, sommelier is charming, atmosphere is marvelous, and the food is worth every penny.  It is not an inexpensive restaurant, but quite frankly, the best steak we have ever had.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas - it was smashingly delicious!  Three days after the meal, we're still talking about it!  Try it - you won't be disappointed!  (And if anyone tries the $11,000 bottle of wine on the menu, please let me know what it tastes like!  :) )",

    "text": "My wife and I watch a lot of Top Chef, so when we booked a weekend at the Mirage it was a no brainer to try Tom Colicchhio's steak house. It was disappointing to the point of being comical. My wife summed it up perfectly when she said, \"If a contestant on Top Chef had put this food in front of him, Collichio would have torn him a new one.\"  I ordered the New York strip. Good, but nothing special. I actually thought the New York strip I had at Elway's at the Denver airport was better. I also got the fries, because I love a good steak-frites. The plate of fries I got looked like a plate you'd get at Denny's. Very dry, over salty, with no flavor. I sent them back, which is the first time I've ever sent food back at a restaurant, but for $13 a plate, those fries should have tickled my gonads. I even asked them if the fries were frozen. They assured me they make them by hand daily. I guess I'll take them on their word, but I have my doubts. So for $75 I got a decent steak and terrible fries. Oh yeah, and the cheapeast glass of red was 17 bucks. Again, good but nothing special. The next tier up was in the high 20s and mid 30s. That's asking a heck of a lot for a glass of wine.  My wife ordered the brisket which was good. However, the mustard dressing on the brisket was the same sauce they put on the vegetables, so everything on her plate tasted the same. My wife is also gluten and dairy free and asked if she could substitute the creamy polenta that came with the brisket for something else. The waitress said she would check, but we never saw her again until they brought our food with the creamy polenta. Then it got funny. To the manager's credit she didn't charge us for the fries and comped us two free desserts. Three different people assured my wife that she was getting dairy-free sorbet including the manager. One of the flavors was fromage-blanc which tasted great. I asked the manager how they got such an authentic cheese flavor without using dairy. She actually got the dessert chef who explained that they used goat cheese. We all paused for an awkward silence. My wife was too embarassed to say anything and I was on the verge of cracking up. Finally the chef asked if my wife was okay with goat cheese. My wife allowed the chef to save face and said yes, but when she left we lost it. Memo to Tom Collichio and his staff: CHEESE IS DAIRY! Even if it comes from a goat.   I will say the desserts were excellent and by far the best part of the meal. But if you go to a steak house and the best thing is dessert, it's not a good steak house. I'm sure this place will be successful simply because it's Tom Collichio, but if it was anyone else's name on the door people would say it's so-so and ridiculously over priced.",

But he  does know how to pour a bourbon.....   165.00$$$$  Also the Italian resturaunt is WONDERFUL  and they also know how to take care of the customer experience .So leave the steaks for the pro's and enjoy the Italian instead",

    "text": "I have no idea why anyone could review this less than 4 stars. We eat out often, and at many nice steakhouses. Last year, I had the worst steak of my life at a famous NY place that cost double this meal. Heritage Steak did NOT disappoint me....  I don't eat shellfish or $150 cuts of meat, so I cannot comment on the Wagyu or lobster, but... my filet was excellent. The other filet at our table was devoured. My guess is the Wagyu would not disappoint. Sea bass was amazing. Ceviche perfect. Nice salads with tomatoes that have actual flavor! Fantastic creamy onion soup. Asparagus special was light and well-liked. Grilled potatoes with caramelized onion cream seriously to die for. Only thing that wasn't a hit was one shrimp cocktail, and the complaint was they were too big... Three of us had toasted marshmallow ice cream (one with the blueberry cobbler) and I need to go home and try to make it. So good. The restaurant is quiet and relaxing, and we could not smell any cigarette smoke, despite being near the casino floor.  Wines by glass we ordered were delicious. Sommelier surprised us with two dessert tastings, and he was spot on. Service overall was excellent and attentive. Best meal we have had in a long time. I say, if you are in Vegas and want a steakhouse, run to Heritage Steak.",

I double checked that is how their medium steaks are prepared, and received a snarky response from the waiter, something like \"I think we know how to cook a steak.\" Mine came pink and juicy, bordering rare, not a single person inquired about my meal. I was left to eat around the edges. I saw many employees notice my picking my steak apart. They didn't care to ask if everything was okay, they could clearly already tell it wasn't it. Fellow diners at my table received over done steaks, so no, I'm sorry, it appears that they do not know how to consistently prepare steaks. The sides were just okay. Fingerling potatoes that I could have made much better and less bland at home. Too thick and greasy of onion rings.Sauteed mushrooms were the best side, perfect flavor. The desserts, however, were absolutely delicious, but not so memorable that I can recall what they actually were. I do recall  however, that they were much better than the rest if the meal.",

We had a hard time finding a light starter and settled for the grilled romaine. With the dressing it was a bit heavy. Lamb ribs were really fatty, although the cucumber sauce was nice. Dinner came. Brisket for me, filet for my wife, medium rare. It came medium well, should have took a picture. Then came the redo, not even a warm steak. It almost seemed spiteful. My wife sent it back. 3rd steak came the same as the second. Each steak came with a new delivery person, each one treating us as if we were just being difficult or like we were trying to get a free steak. Waiter didn't apologize until number 3 and then acted all magnanimous about given it for free when I was done with my meal a while ago. They insisted on bringing a fourth which was finally right. By this time both of us just want to leave. I feel sick after this meal and it was the service and not the food.",

I've eaten at Craft at the MGM Grand a few years ago and that was a great experience.  First of  all the place is super classy in a steak house kind of way, it s a little noisy but its in the middle of the Mirage.  The service was top notched, our waiter was super helpful and chatty but in a good way.  My wife had the wagyu, super tender and delicious and very expensive, that cow must have lived large to have commanded a 160 dollar price, so I told my wife to chew slowly.  I had the duck breast, int was in some kind of sauce.  The sides were great except the french fires were cut a little too large (McDonald's you still rule, keep working on the fires Colicchio). One of our friend drowned her steak with truffles, some crazy price like 10 dollars a slice and 1 dollar just to look.  Good eats at Heritage, a little pricey and would have gotten 5 stars if the fries were better.",

Walked all the way to The Mirage to try the other restaurant of his, which is the Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak. In yelp it says it closes at 10:30pm. We called the mirage and she confirmed it closes at 10:30pm. When we got there at 10pm, they said they're closed. Very disappointed.  If the dining area closes at 10:00, they should convey this on their website and when customers call.",

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the cooking style and the current menu offerings. I ordered the Spice-Roasted Lobster, and was very happy with the taste and preparation. The white polenta it was served on was full of flavor and complemented the spices of the lobster nicely. The entree was also accompanied by fennel and dark mixed salad greens. They remove the lobster tail and claw meat from the shell, you are not served the legs. My friend ordered the 14oz Grilled Ribeye, medium-rare, and there was plenty there for me to have a taste. The steak cut like a filet, and was one of the most tender and juiciest steaks I've ever tasted. For desert I ordered the Peanut Butter Semifreddo and my friend had 2 scoops of ice cream. The deserts are portioned for one, so there's not much there to share. Mine arrived as light, soft peanut butter bars on top of chocolate ice cream. I was happy with my desert choice, and it didn't leave me feeling guilty like I just had a huge piece of peanut butter pie. If your a fan of Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at MGM and want to try something different, a wood grilled alternative style, then I recommend this restaurant. For the record, Craftsteak is my all-around favorite steakhouse on the Strip.",

Second, the terrible ambiance of this restaurant. It was cold and I felt like I was sitting on a sofa. The tables are so tightly packed, you get bumped by waiters and other guests (not even one waiter apologized). Third, the food - the Cesar salads were wilted and the steaks were subpar at best. It took over 45 minutes and the portions were tiny. The restaurant was not busy. Fourth, while waiting you would think we would be given a piece of bread. Every other steakhouse and restaurants on the strip provides this. Fifth, why were all the numerous servers and manager hovering just standing and looking around the perimeter of the restaurant. Last, the only reason this restaurant is managing to stay open is due to the placement in the Mirage hotel - it's certainly not due to the service or food.",

The service was fantastic and the food was incredible. Our waiter was incredibly attentive and deserves kudos! We ate dinner there to celebrate our dual birthdays. We ordered two appetizers- the grilled octopus and the grilled gulf shrimp. The octopus was fantastic. (I'm not a big octopus fan, but this was delish!)  The grilled shrimp was just ok in my book, but my date loved them.   We each ordered a glass of the Rose which was crisp & light.  For our main entrees, I had the NY Strip & my date had the bone in porterhouse (32oz).  My NY Strip was 3 big slices of steak (cooked to a perfect medium well), with wilted greens side, and potatoes (they were boiled, fried, & smashed and brushed with butter). Major yum!  My date loved his porterhouse that came with pee-wee potatoes.  We also ordered two sides- roasted mushrooms & puree potatoes.  OMG, I LOVED the mushrooms & mixing them with the puree was to-die-for. The mushrooms was a mix of multiple types of shrooms (i think 3 types).   My date is a big fine-diner and said the my NY Strip was the best he had ever had (and he has had quite a few). :)  Major compliment to the chefs!   The restaurant was super sweet and brought us each out a wonderful dessert with a birthday candle.  Not sure what the dessert was, it was kind of like a little bundt bread cake with warm flavors and a dollop of cream on the side. (again YUM!) I had a cappuccino to finish off my meal and my date had an espresso.  The cappuccino was one of the best I've had in quite a long while and was similar to what I've found in Italy.   I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant.  Thank you for a fabulous dining experience and for making our birthdays special!",

    "text": "These poor reviews are way off.  My husband and I travel and dine as a religion.  We've had it all and we enjoy eating well at home, too.  We were (sadly) staying at the Mirage, and thought we'd pop in here as we are both steak lovers and didn't have much time between events to eat.  We didn't have a reservation, and happily just sat in the bar/lounge area, which was fine.  We started with onion rings which HAND TO GOD, amazing.  To. die. for.  Quite simple in a beer batter, with a yummy orange-y sauce, but truly perfectly prepared and the onion did not pull out on the first bite.  Just a nice, crunchy, tasty onion ring that you can actually eat without embarrassing yourself.  I will be back for this!  Even if you just have a glass of wine and onion rings in the bar, you will be quite happy!  Secondly, we each had a steak.  I think we both had a ribeye, but mine may have been a filet.  Bottom line: perfect.  Quite delicious, cooked as requested: rare plus.  But what I really loved was the little bit of oil and herbs across the top.  I believe it was finely chopped rosemary, garlic if I recall, not heavy, just a touch.  It was a very nice touch.  We usually just like our steaks plain with a nice course salt on our rare bites.  I loved this and vowed to prepare it at home like that next time.  My opinion: yes, it's a bit pricey for most, particularly if you have to sit in the lounge and smell the stinky Mirage air, but it's excellent, solid and even \"elegant\" food, well prepared with lovely staff, and it will be my first reservation next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow. I've eaten at most of the celebrity steakhouses in Vegas and this, by far, has been my favorite. There is an obvious love and appreciation for the ingredients. Our table of four shared five appetizers that were all amazing. I especially enjoyed the octopus and the quail skewer. For dinner our table either had the filet or the ribeye. My filet was perfectly cooked over a real charcoal fire and was so tender I could have cut it with a fork. The seasoning was enough to give it some extra flavor but not cover the meat. The ribeye received the same reviews. The brussell sprouts had good flavor and I even had seconds! The service was professional, helpful, and very knowledgeable. I guarantee that I will be back. Colicchio and crew have figured it out, I just hope that everyone else recognizes it too.",

We were seated immediately, but when my boyfriend asked for a beer that was not on the special drink menu, our waiter disappeared.  Left for over 10 minutes, we were noticed by another waiter, Anthony. We, again, explained that we were going to the 9:30 show and he said we would have plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  He made sure my boyfriend got his beer immediately, then answered our menu questions.  I had the Braised Short Ribs (which I'd never had) and BF had the 8 oz. Filet.  We also ordered the Spicy Onion Rings and Brussels Sprouts (also my first time).  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was PERFECT!  Yes, it was pricey, but we expected it.  After Anthony took over, our service was impeccable. I highly recommend Heritage and, if possible, ask to be seated in Anthony's section!",

The steak was tasty, the quail tiny, and the octopus very bitter.   For my main, I had the rib-eye, cooked medium rare. I ate about half of it. Imagine a cut that is held together by 5 large pieces of fat - the outside was cooked perfectly, but the inside was raw and a web of fat. Not a quality piece of meat.   Service was excellent and the beer list varied. But, for a $100 check, I was left disappointed.",

When we asked the waiter if \"Chef\" came regularly we were told he had been there \"a couple of months ago.\"  It showed. The atmosphere and wait staff was great, very attentive.  The food, well if Tom was being judged on Top Chef he would have been one of the first to pack his knives.  $12 for five, soggy with grease onion rings (I could actually squeeze the breading and oil dripped onto my plate).  The white dipping sauce was similar to an Alabama bbq sauce and the best part of the plate. I ordered the foie gras, but I couldn't tell if that was really what it was from either the texture or the taste which was masked with a flavor that I'm still not sure about.  Lots of overly brown/grilled ersatz vegetables. I know; I could have complained, but with the high stature of the Mirage and the owner I shouldn't have had to. The other four diners at the table didn't really have any complaints except that the steak my 89 yr old MIL shared with my SIL looked very small and BARE on the large white plate it was served on with absolutely nothing else on it.  Not even a sprig of parsley.",

    "text": "For anyone who thinks this will be the same food and experience as Craftsteak, Tom Colicchio's other Steakhouse in Vegas at the MGM Grand, I want to warn you that it is most certainly NOT.  I have been dining at Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak at the MGM for almost 15 years and have had an exceptional experience every time.  A few years ago, Colicchio opened another steakhouse at the Mirage, Heritage Steak.  While one would assume these 2 high end restaurants would serve the same quality food and provide the same level of service being they are both owned by the same chef, I can tell you that Heritage falls whoefully short on virtually every level.  Not only is the top notch service that is synonomys with Craftsteak missing, but the food quality and presentation is beyond disappointing.  Took several friends here for a NYE dinner, promising them the same exceptional experience I've come to expect from Craftsteak, only to be embarassed beyond belief.  The service was subpar and underwhelming at best, and every course we ordered was below average and grossly overpriced.  I wish I could find one thing that Heritage did right, unfortunately there was none.  I am shocked that Mr. Colicchio could put his name on such a disappointing restaurant and I can't understand how the management at his 2 Vegas establishments could be so vastly different.  My recommendation is to avoid Heritage at all costs and if you can't get a reservation at Craftsteak, check out Gordon Ramsey Steak, Prime at Bellagio or SW at Wynn.",

If you like King crab and chunks of lobster in your hush puppy, and let's face it, who doesn't? Then I highly suggest you pop in. Not to mention the service is incredibly friendly and professional.  The King crab roll was not too rich and it was surprisingly delicate with a good clump to shredded meat ratio. The sliced pickle and chive were a nice touch.  When the hushpuppies were delivered the aroma of the lobster and corn meal wafted majestically over us, and that is the part of an eating experience that is not talked about enough. The smell. It is such an important part of the dining experience and this dish reminded me of that fact.  It smelled almost better than it tasted.  Down these little bad boys fast though as the moisture/heat dies down quickly and when it does, then so does a lot of its flavor. And BTW, awesome tartar sauce!  I can't give four stars though as I did not order very much and I can't speak to it's dinner menu.",

    "text": "I was in town for a convention was going to see a show at the Mirage with clients.  They wanted steak, but I was hesitant to go to Heritage since it had mediocre reviews and there are so many other great steak houses in Vegas.  My clients wanted to give it a try since they knew who Tom Colicchio is and it was conveniently located in the same hotel as the stage show we were going to see.  We got there early to ensure we would make the show, but I was still surprised at how empty it was.  That should have been a warning, but we had to stay at that point.   We ordered the Seafood Tower and Oysters on the Half shell to start.  Seafood was okay, good ceviche.  But the crab was still icy.  Oysters were pretty bland and flavorless.  I'd expect these kinds of oysters at a buffet.    We ordered a few different steaks to share among us.  Dry Aged NY Strip was cooked well, but didn't really have any deep flavor that I expect from being dry aged.  Filet Mignon was nice and tender.  I'm not really a filet fan, so I didn't eat much of this steak.  We also ordered a Wagyu steak.  This was pretty disappointing as it had several thick pieces of fat running through it.  Not the nicely marbled fat meat as is more typical of a wagyu meat.   Sides were fine: Mushrooms, Fries, and Asparagus.   Best thing about the night were the drinks.  Good amount of alochol and nicely mixed.    Overall I would not come back to this place, even if I was staying at the hotel.",

    "text": "*Thumbs up* I've been eyeing this restaurant ever since it was announced last year. I stay at Mirage quite a bit, and to see the transformation from the old Kokomo's restaurant to Heritage Steak has been pretty cool. I've been a fan of Tom Colicchio ever since his early days at Gramercy Tavern in NYC. Now because of Top Chef, he's been slapping his name in front his restaurants in Vegas.  I've dined at Craftsteak at MGM Grand several times, which has some great steaks -- so I was looking forward to the open wood-fired steaks. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to try the bone-in ribeye, and it did not disappoint. Nice, charred flavor on the outside -- not burnt -- and a juicy, tender, pink center in the middle.   The steak comes with small side of fingerling potatoes, so if you're thinking of ordering an extra side of starch to go along with the protein, I say hold off -- unless you're starving, of course. The chargrilled octopus and bone marrow were okay, nothing memorable. For dessert, the smore's fritters with graham cracker ice cream was excellent and a great way to end the meal.  *Thumbs down* My wife ordered the soy-chili glazed skewers, with a choice of either chicken wings, skirt steak, quail, or sea scallops. The scallops were overcooked. There was also a bitter and acrid taste from the glaze that \"over-caramelized\" on the grill. It happens all the time at restaurants, and I've done the same thing cooking at home.  Long story short, when we brought this up to the waiter, he said that the chef said that the bitter flavor was intended on the scallops. Really? Please, don't insult us. They finally came to their senses and gave us another order of just simple salt and pepper on the scallops (which I told them to). For the second go-around, the scallops were perfectly cooked.  If you're a fan of Chopped on Food Network, you know how Scott Conant despises raw red onion? Well, I'm the same way with flat leaf parsley. I can't stand the stuff when it's overused. It leaves such a bitter and overpowering flavor that shatters my taste buds. Both the octopus and bone marrow appetizers were covered in so much flat leaf parsley that I had to scrape all of it off. Blech.  5 stars for the steak, 3 stars for everything else.",

The bread was like butter and sliced that way on arrival. Service was beyond spectacular. Multiple people who were absolutely thrilled to have you at the establishment would help you in any way they could. Started with the Dogfish Head IPA. Excellent choice. I hope it stays like this for next time. I showed up in very much business casual, baseball cap, and converse shoes. I might as well have been wearing my three piece the way I was treated by every person on staff. Thank you so much!",

The atmosphere is really good, quite and appropriate for a dinner and a date.  Food didn't take a long time to come out, however, when I bit into my steak, it was very chewy and tasted a little bloody. It was dark, so I pulled a flashlight on my phone, and, instead of the steak being \"medium\" it was almost rare. But you know, I took it home and decided to cook the microwave the next day. I wasn't going to wait another 20 mins for another one to come . My friend, on the other hand, ordered a second beer before the food arrived and didn't get it until we were getting ready to pay the bill...the waiter was nowhere to be found for a while and everyone was so busy dancing around some important chef that was in dinning. But the server was nice enough to take the beer off the bill.  In conclusion, I have to say that I have eaten a better food at a less expensive restaurant! No wonder that they have 3.5 stars overall. Will not be visiting this place again!",

The wait for places like CPK were long, so we decided to go to this place instead.  We knew it would be more expensive, but we didn't think it would be THAT expensive.  The most expensive item I noticed on the menu was the 8-oz Wagyu Striploin for about $160.  None of  us were feeling that ballerific that night.  Reservations aren't necessary unless you wish to be seated deeper inside.  We found plenty of tables at that front lounge area without having to wait.  I ate the braised pork belly.  It ended up including some delicious fried oysters, horseradish, and tomato molasses.  So, I surely enjoyed my meal that night.  My glass of scotch was $12.  That'll give you an idea how much they charge for alcohol.  I've been to places that charge $20 for the same thing, so at least it's reasonable for the place.  If you can afford it, this would be a great place for a meal.  You'd be a complete moron if your meal here ended up tasting bad, you scum.",

The waitress seemed to think that since she worked at a moderately expensive restaurant that by default she would receive a comparable tip, however in the hour or so we were there we saw her twice and she clearly ignored us at other times. I am not a rich man but I would have left a nice tip for good service had she merited it.  Damn good New York Strip Steak I must say though!!!",

I had the NY Strip Steak ($45) which was 3 big slices of steak (cooked to a perfect medium rare), a wilted greens side, and also some New Potatoes (they were boiled, then fried, then smashed and brushed with butter and were FREAKING AMAZING).   The table shared the Spicy Onion Rings (good but not $12 Good), Creamless Cream Corn (not sure how it's made, but it was really damn good), and both Steak and Duck Skewers (the duck was my favorite but both were good and decent sized).  The prices are on point with most steak houses, and the entrees actually come with sides not just a la cart like most places.  There was a ton of staff, our water glasses were constantly filled and questions were answered immediately.  My only complaint and what is preventing them from 5 stars was their bread basket. It was 4 very hard, very dry basic dinner rolls, which was kind of a let down, but then again if the bread basket is the only complaint I have with a steak house, the place isn't all that bad!",

The restaurant is tucked back in a corner and has quite nice ambience with the modern darkish (not old english library or smoking lounge) wood and the blazing fires.  The deal here is that the meat is cooked \"heritage\" style ... meaning not seared or broied but over a roaring flame.    The baby lettuce salad with avocado, cherry tomatoes and fried shallots with balsamic buttermilk dressing was out of this world -- it's the shallots that did it for me.  Although, there could have been a few more tomatoes for my liking.  My husband loved his filet. He didn't care for the bernaise sauce -- he found it too lemony -- I thought it was great (many bernaise sauces are too tarragony for me).  It was cooked to a perfect medium and lots of flavor.  He still prefers the filets at Daniel's in Seattle ... finds the quality of the meat and the seasoning superior.  I had the 18 ounce bone-in rib eye cooked medium-rare.  Perfectly cooked.  Well seasoned.  Nice marbling.  Way too much food ... could have fed 3 with my steak alone.  Spicy onion rings are thick cut with a medium texture batter, not greasy, and topped with a red pepper spice blend powder.  I prefer thinner cut onion rings, but these were pretty good.  They are served with no sauce owing to the pepper powder.  They don't really need a sauce.  Nice experience.",

The Seafood Tower for two is a lot of food. The marinated shrimp were firm & delicious. I didn't try the octopus salad but he liked it enough to take a second bite. Came with a handful of tasty sauces. Only recommendation would be to swap out a couple king crab legs for the other lobster half.   Overly smokey steaks usually ruin a meal for me, but the smoke that had permeated my 10 oz. filet mignon wasn't offensive in the least. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed the flavor. He ordered 6 oz. of A5 wagyu steak & said it was very similar to the ones he tasted in Japan. ($25/oz, 4 oz. minimum.)   Sides of creamed corn & baked potato were average. Sometimes simple & traditional is best; we would've liked regular butter & sour cream instead of the chef's inventive concoction topping the spud that fell somewhat short.   As if our meal wasn't enormously decadent enough, we ended with an Ice Cream Social. Dry ice rolling in smoky swirls surrounded two ice cream bars. A \"bar\" containing melted chocolate, sprinkles, peanuts, cookie crumbles, & funnel cake were the accompaniments & the dipping fun began. Completely over the top!   Our damage was a few bucks shy of $450 with tax & tip. We weren't celebrating anything in particular, but any meal with him is a special occasion *insert winky face here*",

Here's the problem, if you are going to charge $60 for a steak and $13 for a small bowl of mushrooms and green beans, you should make it the best steak and sides a person could ask for.

Friend and I were seated on the patio and we ordered pretty quickly. She ordered a medium rare Filet Mignon while I ordered a medium rare Bone-In Ribeye.  Steaks came out pretty quick, or maybe time just flies when you're in Vegas.   Anyways, both steaks looked good from the outside until I started eating more of my ribeye. I started with the thinner parts and it was about medium, which is fine, but it got worst as I got to the thicker parts. Unfortunately we were checked if everything was alright before I started getting to my now well done ribeye.   Somehow the chef was able to cook my steak medium on the thinner parts of the steak and well down on the thicker side. I pretty much lost my appetite after eating half the steak and just wanted to leave. I mean it was so well done that there was almost no blood on the bone. If I'm paying $60 for a ribyeye here, I'd rather go to The Prime and get their dry-aged ribeye for ~$20 more and get a nice view of the fountain. (Although the ribeye there was also pretty bad, but hey, at least I'd get a awesome view!)  My friend's 10oz filet was great though, cooked just right, no complaints about that.",

Since I'm still in my first trimester of pregnancy most food and drinks are off limits which sucks. Luckily my body has adapted and turned me off to the smell and taste of alcohol which I once highly desired (especially in Vegas). That being said, my husband ordered a glass of the pinot noir and I took a couple sips. It tasted like heaven in the middle of Sin City!   Service was prompt and waters kept refilled at a good pace (I'm drinking like a camel these days). Great way to start our first night of this Vegas trip.",

We've dined here twice before a year ago and both visits were phenomenal.  We were so excited to be dining here again, but this last visit in February 2018 was uncomfortable and was definitely not worth the money.  It's not like we ordered anything different, we ordered the same things - the seafood platter and the A5 Japanese wagyu at $25/oz.  In our previous experiences the A5 wagyu was better than anything we had ever had and we ranted about it to all our friends.  Now we'll have to warn them not to go.    On our most recent visit, the seafood platter was not fresh.  The oysters looked like they could get you sick and the crab legs looked like the worst pickings from a buffet.  The 6 oz. A5 wagyu they served us was mostly fat and very uncomfortable to eat.  I left at least 2 oz ($50!!!) untouched because I couldn't stomach it anymore.  I was close to throwing up.  I think the server knew they were serving not the best quality meat too because he took the dish away without asking any questions to why there was $50 worth of steak untouched.  The sides we ordered were alright, but I came here to eat A5 wagyu steak, not fat.",

This restaurant is located in the jungle area of the Mirage.  For being in the middle of a giant casino it is pretty quiet and intimate.  We started with the grilled octopus.  This generous portion had a smokey flavor and was cooked perfectly.  The 10oz filet was one of the better pieces of meat I have had.  The wood oven gives it a distinct earthy flavor. The lobster thermador was also delicious - we were able to share and make our own surf and turf.    Our server was super attentive and literally ran around the restaurant.  Looking back, there was about 5 people waiting on us seamlessly.  The whole meal and presentation of food was first class! Prices were on par with other steakhouses in Vegas.  I look forward to future trips backs here!",

    "text": "We were incredibly excited to try out Heritage Steak.  We were looking for something similar to our other favorite Tom Colicchio restaurant, Craftsteak. Sadly, this did not impress us even in the slightest.  Our dinner was pretty simple and straight forward classics: Wedge salad, Shrimp cocktail, 18oz ribeye w/foie gras accompaniment, and a half lobster thermidor.    The wedge was good and mostly what you would expect, big chunks of Bleu Cheese, crispy bacon, and the right amount of house made dressing.   The shrimp cocktail was borderline \"return to sender\" as the shrimp were a bit on the soft side of being cooked as well as being a bit colder than room temperature which meant that they smelled fishy and were not enjoyable as a result.  Pair that with the soft texture and it was just a letdown.  The ribeye was your average prime ribeye and I would have preferred to order the dry aged 32oz prime ribeye but that's just plain too much for my wife and I to share. Disappointing for $60 when I could have made it better at home. I added a piece of foie gras that arrived with some chewy bits and was falling apart in its own little cassoulet.  Yet another disappointment when you're beginning to look for something to bring your dinner back on course.   The lobster thermidor was okay.  Nothing to report.   Lastly, let's talk about service.  My wife thought they were okay.  I disagree whole heartedly.  Service in a nutshell was bad.  For any dinner you expect decent timing of everything... our drinks arrived at the same time as our appetizers.  My iced tea was refilled 4-5x but once our complimentary semi fredo arrived (for our anniversary) they disappeared never to be seen again. Furthermore, looking for redemption, when they brought out our complimentary dessert I wanted to order a cappuccino and another dessert.  Our waiter did not return to our table for 10 minutes at which point he finally offered us a dessert menu and/or aperitif. We declined.  At $207 before tip, the cost was similar to craft steak but no where near the quality.  We will not return to Heritage Steak and I would suggest you spend your money elsewhere as well.",

Steak was so tender and delicious  I also ordered the Caesar salad which was as fresh as could be. This was the first time I had eaten an actual anchovy but it really enhances the flavor of the salad.  Place is pricey as you order your sides a la carte, but worth the price. The truffle macaroni and cheese was delicious as was the Yukon gold pureed potatoes. The jalepeno bread served with meal was good, but not my favorite as I enjoy a different variety of bread and rolls and also prefer butter with!  Service was exceptional!  Ambiance- would've rather had a little more quiet and privacy to enjoy my meal with my husband. There was a lot going on at the table beside ours which was a little distracting.  This place would be fit for any high level judge to eat at",

Tonite we decided to have some food on the lounge side.  Wow, what a different experience.  We sat for 39 minutes between drinks, waited forever for a salad, then forever for a seafood tower.

Unforgivable when everyone the kitchen has a meat thermometer.  We asked them to fix it and it came back 15 minutes later, past well-done and barely edible.  This is a $75 steak.  I asked for med-rare and got rare.  The brussel sprouts were good, but the yukon mash was liquid.  They over crowded it.  Too many tables.  You can't even talk across the table without shouting.  The expediter had a huge beard and no covering on it.  We felt like we had to search through our dinner to make sure there were no hairs in it.  They tried to make it up by overselling desert.  We said no, so the manager brought over a bottle of port to apologize for what had happened with the steak.  My wife likes port and recognized the bottle.  This bottle costs $15 at Trader Joes.  Nice offer but $5 of port doesn't balance out what they did to the steak.  We spent the same amount here we usually spend at Prime in the Bellagio.  They don't compare at all.  Try somewhere else if you want a good experience.",

Upon arrival, fifteen minutes early, our hostess seated us immediately without any problem.    There were a few individuals that assisted our table but our main server was James.  I don't remember him introducing himself upon his arrival to our table as he gave us the menus. What gets irritating is he did not come back to our table for over ten minutes - not even to ask what we would like to drink.    For appetizers we ordered Poached Gulf Shrimp and Spanish Salad which we shared, \"family style.\"  Both appetizers were delicious and seasoned perfectly.    For our main course, we ordered Bone-In Rib Eye, Braised Brisket and Roasted Sea Bass.  All three were delicious and each one of is enjoyed the meal.  For sides, we ordered spicy onion rings and risotto.  The Braised Brisket was a favorite and will be ordered again if it's in the menu at the New York restaurant.   Yes, we will visit Tom Colicchio's restaurant in New York this coming December for a birthday weekend.   The meal was delicious but our server, James, lacked service etiquette.  During our meal, he came twice and not once asked if anyone wanted another wine.  The rest of the servers were more helpful than James and one server stands out ( I don't know he's name but he was older who wore glasses). This individual actually came over and ask how our meal was and handed us a copy of the receipt to our meal AND thanked us for coming.    I wished I could give this place more than three stars but service is very important especially in restaurants under a name of someone famous.",

    "text": "What a disappointing steak experience. The meats were not the freshest in Vegas, you could definitely find better steakhouses nearby for the same price. I expected much higher quality steak. I got the Japanese wagyu which should be marbled perfection. I've had quality Kobe beef before, this was not it.   The sides were much better than the steak itself, which is disappointing especially when the restaurant is a steakhouse. The mushrooms were amazingly juicy and flavored well. The bone marrow and lobster were a perfect odd couple--I've never seen the two together before. You can never go wrong with risotto and truffles. The lobster hush puppies were a disappointment; they wet more batter than lobster. Colicchio may benefit from tasting his own menu and spend less time judging others. He definitely has let the quality of this restaurant go. Go for the sides, not the actual steak.",

I went with the bone in ribeye  and it had perfect fat to meat ratio. Ceaser salad was great but big, i would split it. Our sides were potatoes au gratin (amazing but rich,) onion rings (spicy), and risotto my least favorite.  Everything on the menu looked great. I can't wait to go back and order the seafood tower and other cuts of meat and sides. There is a lounge area that looks into the casino and the main dining room was sectioned off. Very modern and sleek. Dim and dark with a blazing fire coming out the open kitchen.  Definitely a 5 star experience.",

First off we sat down for a 8:00pm reservation and was pleased to be seated 5mins earlier. We were greeted quickly and asked for our drink order. We waited about 10mins before we received all of our drinks. And we order our meal apps and entrees together. I noticed a bit of informality with the buss and runners. Just flapping plates on the table. Splashing water into glasses. I also had to ask the buss for bread and butter. He looked at me like \"oh you want bread??? I can order it if you want it?\" I was like oh you have to order it? He said \"it's free don't worry\". Like I may not want it if there's a charge. The steaks come out and it's not a $50 steak. I'd eat here if the steaks were $32 with sides. Don't get me wrong... the quality was fine. But I think they're better steakhouses with better service than this. Try Prime at Bellagio. The steaks are great and the lobster is the best I've ever had.   Server was nice  Food was sub par for price.  Buss and runner was sub par",

They helped me figure out the best glass of wine for my taste and were so helpful.   We were then seated and were greeted by our fabulous server, Fazhad (I am sure I am not spelling this correctly, and I apologize for that). He talked us through the menu and helped us make some decisions. The shrimp and buttery salad were delicious. Then we received our entrees. I ordered the lobster and my husband ordered the filet. Both were absolutely fantastic. The steak was so delicious (my husband let me try it) and my lobster was phenomenal. We also ordered the Truffle Risotto which was so good we ate all of it! I have to also mention Sam. He assisted our server and was so nice! He conversed with us and made our experience that much enjoyable.   I honestly cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We went to a few other restaurants while we have been to Vegas but Heritage, by far, was the best. We have been to Colicchio's Craft restaurant in NY which was also fabulous.   I would always go to one of Tom Colicchio's restaurants if it was an option! He is top notch! Thank you!",

The decor is nice and modern.  Open air restaurant with no walls.    Service was excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  We were suggested a nice Pinot Noir and  everyone was quite happy with the selection, too bad I forgot the name.    We ended up ordering a spice-roasted lobster and the 28 day dry aged Cote de Boeuf 32oz.  The lobster was forgettable.  Nothing really special.  The polenta that accompanied the lobster was pretty good though.    The Cote de Boeuf, however, was a masterpiece.  Cooked perfectly mid-rare, the steak was juicy, full of flavor, and very tender.  Best steak I've had in recent memory.  I have dreams of this steak.  I want one right now!!  The cut of beef is ribeye.  This steak is meant to be shared, but I guess one hungry person can finish the entire steak.    I would recommend this place to anyone who loves steak.  I will be back to try the other cuts of beef, or that is the plan.  I'm not sure if I can pass up on ordering the Cote de Boeuf though.  It was just that good.  If I didn't have that lobster, I may have given this place the full 5 stars on the Cote de Boeuf alone!!",

    "text": "I went here with my boyfriend last night, and we both loved it. Was it pricey? Of course...it's a steakhouse in the most over-indulgent city in the country. To be surprised by the prices seems a little crazy to me. Plus, you get what you pay for. We had the grilled oysters as our first course; I'm not a huge oyster fan, but even I'll admit that they were pretty awesome. For my entree, I got the 14oz NY strip with a very large side of Brussels sprouts braised with apple cider vinegar and bacon (seasonal market vegetable) and I couldn't decide which part of the meal I enjoyed more. The steak was well-seasoned, tender, and textbook medium rare. The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly (i.e., not mushy) and were so flavorful. He got the 18oz bone-in ribeye and roasted mushrooms, which he enjoyed immensely.   The only thing that was kind of odd was the service. It took our waiter a while to get to us initially, and he was very apologetic, promising that he was going to focus solely on us the rest of the night. We knew that obviously wasn't possible because he had other tables, but at least he was nice about it. But after he took our order, he only came by our table one other time before bringing us our check. We had mixed feelings about this, because on the one hand, we felt a little neglected, but on the other hand, we were able to enjoy our food and each other's company without constantly being asked how our meal was while we had mouths full of food. I think what was off putting was just that it's not what we're used to. That being said, I highly recommend this place.",

Still awesome. Service was a little sketch at times. Sometime we'd have 3 servers surrounding them others couldn't buy a glance from a white coat. Gotta say THE thing that gave this place the 4th star was the Goose Bourbon County on tap and the availability of the 10yr Pappy.  We partook in both.

I was in awe at how amazing of an experience I had and how delicious the food was. So I wanted to bring my husband here as a treat, after our wedding. Since my initial visit, I've been to other steakhouses but Heritage seems to be my most memorable one. It may be because it was my first experience at a steakhouse so I am partial to it or because the food is really that amazing... or maybe both!   The service was exceptional. This is definitely someplace you want to go to celebrate an anniversary or a Valentine dinner *hint hint*. Even though the ambiance may seem a little more luxurious, it really is not too, too fancy. We're not fancy schmancy ourselves and we felt comfortable there.   To top it off, the waitress surprised us with a chocolate cake on the house! As she greeted us we briefly mentioned we were celebrating our recent wedding, and how excited we are to eat here. She remembered and wrote \"Congratulations\" on the! That really was a WOW moment!",

We went in with a group of foodies and people appreciate good food. We had steaks and the steaks are very $$$ cuts and well worth it. I had a 14 oz New York Steak . Fat trim off and cooked perfectly. All the sides are $$$ but we'll worth it with size and taste and quality.   Nice place with a good wine list with a professional wine expert whom there job is to educate wine.   The price is scary but we'll worth it. Special place if your pallete came eat and taste flavour you have never  knew that you have.",

I wish there was a better way to separate the main restaurant from the casino as it would add to the ambience considerably.

    "text": "Dined last night at Heritage Steak. We had an early dinner before the Beatles Love show. Started with a lot of promise and went downhill. We loved the decor, table was ready at the time of our reservation. While the restaurant was just off the casino floor we were pleasantly surprised at how it wasn't too Smokey. The decor was great, simple but intriguing. I also loved the oversized round 4 tops. Love the bundles of wood around the kitchen. Our server Kim was great he was attentive but not invasive. Water glasses never went empty and we were constantly draining them. Appetizer course was delicious. I enjoyed the wedge salad and my wife enjoyed the arugula salad. My mother loved the cold Lobster salad. They also served some delicious warm cheddar biscuits. Then things took a turn. Entree's were not cooked well. Would we have not been in a hurry to make the Beatles show we would have sent it back. My wife and I split the double cut ribeye and it was over cooked. Bone marrow side saved the day as that was so good. My mother ordered the duck and many parts were tender and delicious but several parts were almost rubbery. Mashed potatoes were very bland. We did enjoy the corn, had a great spicy flavor.  We were surprised at the end with a chocolate/vanilla ice cream treat with sprinkles. That was also good and on the house for our birthday. In this day and age with the variety of options out there I'm not sure you can excuse not preparing the meat to the proper temperature or the rubbery issue with the duck. I can see how this place can get a bad rap on Yelp at that price point and those cooking mistakes.",

On other visits the bar was a great spot for excellent cocktails and service, but timing and other plans kept me from enjoying what I was anticipating for several months now.  I know Celebrity restaurants, I have been to a dozen, a few stand out (Nola & K Pauls, Mesa Grill), and a few fell far short of the mark of my expectations (Mora), one was a disaster if it was an Applebee's (Guy Fieri's).  Not Heritage, it lines up with the best in service and taste. Every bite of my steak was delightful, and when it was gone I was sad. I loved the Caesar Salad and didn't mind one bit of the little extra work you get to do composing it on your own plate. anchovies and perfectly cooked soft eggs under a magnificent bet of finely dressed romaine and not too creamy dressing, the perfect grind of parmesan cheese and bread crumbs.   Service was on point and just right for this solo diner. My server was sweet and kind and wanted to make sure I was treated right so I could relax and enjoy my time at Heritage. In short she was wonderful.  With a glass of wine it was just over 100.00 dollars out the door, (there is no door here) its about average for a great meal in Vegas.",

It is prepared when you order it with a great dressing, toasted bread crumbs, anchovy fillets on the side for flavor and, wait for it, a soft boiled egg!  Next up, a simply perfect shrimp cocktail. Five jumbo shrimp, perfectly cooked and simple cocktail sauce.  Finally the new item (for me), the pork belly. Braised pork belly which is then DEEP FRIED!!! Served with a little veg. Awesome.

The biscuits were hard crackers, the \"strawberry jam\" was 1-2day old macerated strawberries NOT jam, the pork belly was poorly cooked. The top meat layer was severely overcooked to the point is was dry, hard and nearly unchewable. The skin layer (cracklins) was soggy and offered no texture (because cracklings are damn good). For dinner I had the Wagu flat iron steak. This was a very nice steak, tender, and well seasoned. Problem is I asked for medium rare, which I expect bright pink/red center. I got light pink/brown center warm all the way through that was much closer to medium well-well. If you are steak house please know how to cook to appropriate temperature if your charging over $50 for a steak.",

I ordered dry aged, bone in NY on the rare side of MR. Flavor profile was outstanding but it was cooked medium. They comped $68 steak off bill for my guest but we still paid over $300 for 3 people.

We went to dinner before the Cirque Beatles show. Our server on our journey I believe was Suzanne (I'm sure you can deduct who this was). From the start we had the tools and a guide to get us through our journey here. Great recommendations and friendly service. Even Thomas, the server assistant was 5 star quality. He made sure that our waters were filled and our plates were cleared the moment the last morsel was consumed.   I can talk about the service all day, but let's talk about Tom and George's food (George also came to our table and was very friendly).  The steaks we ordered were picture perfect rare steaks. I have never in my life seen a steak as beautiful as this (NY Strip). I have been to many steakhouses around the country, around the world even, and nothing could honestly compare to the precision that George and his staff delivered to our table.  In conclusion, as a member of the service industry myself, the performance of every staff member that we encountered, from the efficient host to our lovey server, gave us a 5 star show. Thank you so much.",

It is like an atrium and every clink of the slots and drunken twenty-something hooting at the craps table can be heard clearly.  Service is TOP NOTCH. The staff is well versed and skilled and the sommelier was knowledgeable.  The food is good. But it is NOT worth $500 for two apps, steak for two and dessert.  Wine is the usual 3x.  The grilled romaine was woefully over dressed and one third of my plate was inedible lettuce core. The yellowtail app was unique but shockingly small. The steak was ordered medium rare but was medium plus (almost no pink left).  It was tasty, but while marbled is good, grisly fat is not. I love the taste a bit of fat lends a steak, but this could not be chewed.  The brussel sprouts were very good.  Dessert (corn fritters with pineapple chutney) was a bright spot.  . This place is just not special enough to justify the pricing.",

    "text": "we are die hard craft steak fans. every trip to vegas is not complete without us going to that restaurant. we were told colicchio's new restaurant, heritage steak, had just opened at the Mirage about a week ago. I really put a lot of time into deciding to go with the old reliable craft steak or trying the new restaurant. Should have gone to craft.  first impression: The place is not as big or up scale as craft. They had plenty of staff but the service was not fluent, ok its a new restaurant and they are working out the kinks. Ordered drinks, took a while, ok we werent there to get drunk so no biggie. ordered the lamb ribs, hamachi, and the ash bone marrow. the hamachi and the ribs were phenomenal, the bone marrow (to my disappointment) was undercooked and didnt come with any toast so eating it was a bit weird. Ordered the tabasco peppered kobe skirt and my wife had the spice roasted lobster. The steak was ok at best, definitely not the same kobe skirt that they have at craft. The lobster was overcooked in my opinion and a bit tough to chew. For desert, we had mascarpone panna cotta which was very nice and tasty. oh yeah, and they were so nice to bring us a small bunt cake looking thing since I had notated in my reservation that we are celebrating our wedding anniversary. I am sorry, but if spending $300 per couple for dinner doesnt constitute a decent desert, then dont bother bringing me a dry little cake with a candle on it. overall, did not measure to the expectations, thought the menu wasnt impressive, lacked raw seafood and not a huge selection of steaks to choose from, etc. There are too many better steak houses in vegas for me to try heritage again, sorry Tom.",

    "text": "When coming to a higher end steakhouse, the one thing I expect the most is a great steak.  I had the New York strip at $56, which in Vegas is not that bad.  It was good size as well.  The problem was that I ordered medium and the steak was definitely medium rare.  Now I didn't send it back because I can eat medium rare and the steak was good, not great.  With the steak, I ordered the risotto and the onion rings.  Got to admit, probably the best onion rings I've had.  Risotto was good too, maybe a little too much garlic.  I will probably give it another shot and give the chef another crack at cooking my steak how I want it since everything else was really good.  But with so many other steakhouses in the valley, probably be best if they knew how long to keep the steak on the grill.  Just a note, the couple next to us sent back one of their steaks because it wasn't cooked enough.  Maybe order medium well to get a True medium?  I will be going to Old Homestead steakhouse this weekend.  So far either Ramsey's Steak or Carnevino is the best I've had in Vegas.",

The astounding beef quality really shines through with this simple preparation.  The carrots were roasted with a honey glaze - and a variety of colors.  I cannot wait to recreate this gem of a recipe at home.  The desserts were excellent.  Whilst the chai semifreddo was very small, I didn't manage to finish it, even though it was decadent and delicious.  The wine list was extensive, as was the tea menu for dessert.  The husband loved his ribeye with roasted onions, and the apple tart.  I was very glad to find the same impeccable level of service as Craft and Craftsteak in a new setting.  The linear architecture is both elegant and slightly more casual.  I was perfectly sated without the temptation of Craftsteak's tasting menu.",

There were no signs pointing to its direction and a few bartenders on the casino floor had no idea what place we were talking about.  Thankfully an authoritative-looking man was able to point us in the right direction.  The place is a modern, clean, crisp upscale looking bbq joint with an open kitchen with cooks wearing trucker hats.  I ordered the grilled peach salad with arugula and Serrano ham for a starter.  It came out with 2 grilled peach wedges, hardly enough to call it a peach salad.  However, the serving of Serrano ham was impressive.  For dinner I ordered the $58 rib eye.  At first bite, I was in heaven.  Towards the middle of my steak, my jaw became tired from chewing.  My meat had too many tendons and fat on it and I even had to spit out a huge bite since it wasn't chewable.  Side dishes were delicious green beans and firm and flavorless eggplant.  The dessert was good but forgettable.  This place seems to have an overabundance of servers.  I believe we had about 6 different gentlemen waiters at our table at some point.  The servers were a bit too eager and just too much for an intimate meal.",

    "text": "There are some restaurants that are great and there are some restaurants that are made greater by the people they employ.  My husband and my experience at Heritage Steak was made greatER by two specific employees. My husband and I decided to go here Christmas Eve.   We have dined at Colicchio & Sons in NYC so we knew the food would be awesome.  What we didn't know, however, was how much of more pleasant experience we had in dining due to our two attentive bartenders Travis and Justin. Right off the bat, they were friendly, served us water, asked us what we wanted to drink, and they set us up right away. After asking if we were going to eat, they set up the place mats.  We inquired as to the amount of the food we ordered (we didn't want too much food but we also wanted to make sure we covered our bases in terms of the restaurant's hits).  Justin told us to get the octopus as an addition.  We did. The food came out quickly but both of us were able to enjoy light conversation with both bartenders.  They conversed easily in a way that didn't seem contrived.  Everything flowed well.  I even overheard a woman exclaim that Travis was her favorite bartender on her visit to Vegas.  Not hard to believe. The two, though they have never worked together before, were a seamless pair.  They tended to the bar in tandem, never skipping a beat, all the while, I never saw them not clean glasses, not refill water, not make sure all the patrons were alright.  Those two were effortless and well trained.  They were always doing something.  It was great to see them both in action and to meet them. Justin shared his favorite hangover cure with my husband and we all discussed fernet and its wondrous properties. We had a great experience here and it was definitely heightened by our encounter with Travis and Justin. Our octopus was flavorful and tender, the bone marrow was divine!  The steak was done perfectly but man, oh man, those mushrooms were to die for.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our last meal in Vegas.",

We started with the grilled octopus and crispy pork belly. Both were amazing. Octopus was very fresh and very tender. The pork belly was very very tender as well. Both portions were large compared to what I was expecting. We then shared the bone in ribeye with truffle (they had a special to add on fresh truffle). The steak was cooked perfectly, and they knew we were sharing and actually pre cut it and brought it out on 2 separate plates which was very thoughtful and convenient. The truffle was decadent and the steak was delicious. Another successful Colicchio restaurant.",

    "text": "There are so many amazing Steakhouses in Las Vegas, and sadly this was a wrong choice. What a bummer!  Such little time in town, choosing \"that big night out for that big night food experience\" took some research and I couldn't have made a worse choice. Everything was over-seasoned...from the Broccoli Cicco to whatever they drowned my brother-in-law's Filet with..there must have been a Pepper Monkey in the kitchen.  And $17 for a glass of Cabernet that was at best 2nd shelf up at the Walgreen's Liquor Store? Geesh.  It went from lame to worse upon using a Restroom... I'm OK with a unisex restroom, if it's necessary, but not really necessary here.   When I'm dropping $400 on a dinner for 3, I expect NOT to visit a restroom with a toilet surrounded by the previous person's extremely bad aim.  Really??? It was pretty disgusting.  Meanwhile there was an overstaff standing around the restaurant doing nothing but look very pretty.  One of them should have been cleaning the nasty bathroom.  I could have had a better steak at Outback, and pretty much wished I would have.   My steak was ordered MR, and it arrived on my plate cut in 2...half was almost MR, the other ha  lf M.  I was wondering where that promised woodfired traditional \"Heritage\" flavor was...there was none.  A Line Cook in a diner with a George Forman could have accomplished better woodfired flavor.  In closing, I suggest Chef Collichio spend more time in his restaurants and less time on TV.",

We were seated promptly for our reservation, very convenient after seeing Love across the casino!  Our server was friendly and knowledgable but we were left wondering where he was on a couple of occasions, the biggest gap being between getting our cocktails and him returning for our order.  I ordered the American Wagyu Skirt Steak and the server made a big deal about the chef suggesting medium rare.  It came quite rare, which was fine... I prefer rare anyway but it wasn't what was ordered. Either way it was a good steak, and I had no need to send it back  My wife had the duck which was a tad dry but flavourful.  Sides were very good with the risotto being a stand out.  Dessert was also very good.  Wine list was up there in price but both of our selections (by the glass) were very nice.  One unique feature was the craft beer list.  Normally I don't order a beer at a nice steakhouse but the list intrigued me and I had a really nice local IPA.  Overall, Heritage Steak was indeed A-OK but fell short of my other Vegas steakhouse experiences (Cut and The Former Nero's) and short of my experience at Craft and Collicchio & Sons in NYC.  Good concept but I think Tom needs to pay a visit and sharpen things up a bit.",

    "text": "We're sorry to report that Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak at the Mirage Hotel would receive subpar points if judged during restaurant wars on Top Chef.  Our initial encounter with the hostess was very disappointing.  We arrived 30 minutes early, hoping to have a drink at the table, and were told that we could either order drinks at the bar or walk around for half an hour but we could not be seated early because the restaurant was very busy.  We opted for the bar.  When our table was ready, the bartender said we should close our tab before the hostess would seat us.  We paid our bill and the hostess told us to grab our drinks and she would show us to our table.  We were surprised that she didn't offer to help carry the drinks.  This poor service and bad attitude was consistent.  When we were shown our table, it was unacceptable because it blocked the pathway in and out of the area.  The hostess claimed she had few tables available because the restaurant was sold out.  We pointed to two other empty tables and she told us to take either one, then she left abruptly without a menu or a goodbye.  We sat empty handed except for the drinks, hoping someone would bring a menu.  Soon Albert the waiter, who was friendly and gracious, brought us a menu and was quick to share his thoughts and recommendations.  The rest of the staff pampered us and provided excellent service.  The food was very good and we enjoyed our meal.  We do have one suggestion for the restaurant:  have at least one green vegetable on the menu as a side dish.  The side dish for the evening was some delicious corn, but spinach or asparagus would have been preferred (it makes us believe we are healthy meat eaters from California).  The front staff rates a \"D-\" because of the poor customer service and bad attitudes.  On the other hand, the wait staff was excellent and deserves an \"A+\" for a job well done.",

    "text": "Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak is a wonderful new addition to the Mirage hotel.  Located where Kokomo's used to be near the front of the hotel, the dining room seems to be tucked away from the slot machines and tourists meandering about out front.  Inside is a nicely designed 200+ seating area, where steaks are flame broiled in plain view.  The appetizer list makes for a tough decision, with so many great choices to choose from.  The Hamachi with beet and caviar is a wonderful combination of sea and greens, refreshing and flavorful.  The grilled peaches with jamon iberico and pepper arugula salad is a MUST!  Best grilled peaches I have ever tasted.  The octopus was a bit lackluster.  Could not really find the main focus of the dish.  A bit mush and the flavors did not blend well.  The steaks are great.  Prime cuts, beautiful look, and extremely flavorful.  The desert menu makes for a hard choice, but I tried the corn fritters (which I think were more like corn beignets or doughnuts) with blueberries and corn ice cream.  Wish I could have gotten a pint of the corn ice cream to take home.  Overall, this place is great!  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the staff will bring your plate and drop it off and then leave.  No explanation of the food (so keep a menu nearby during the meal!).  Other than that, this a must go-to for any foodie and should become a regular spot for any local fan of good food!",

We had the charred ceasar - ok only - a bit too vinegary for my liking.  Then we each had the rib-eye - ok but certainly not the best I've had in Vegas.  They brought us the wrong potato order and promptly replaced once we could find a waiter.  The next potato - a \"grilled\" potato with caramelized onion - was awful.  They weren't grilled; more like baked and sliced and the onion was entirely too overpowering.  The worst part of the experience was our service.  Once the food was delivered we never saw our waiter again - not once.  We had to ask another waiter to assist with the wrong potato order and we had to ask management for our check.  These prices do not allow for poor service - it's simply not acceptable.  We won't be returning.",

    "text": "We are Las Vegas locals and have tried nearly every steak house in the valley.  We were excited to try Heritage Steak due its convenient location as we were seeing a show that night at the Mirage.  We were greeted cordially by three female greeters that were dressed professionally and were promptly seated.  The section we were in was moderately busy but not bustling.  The visual ambience was very nice architecturally and was warm and inviting.  The background music was too loud and it was difficult to have a conversation over it.  The cooks/chefs were wearing baseball caps, which really detracted from the elegance of the restaurant.  Once we were seated, we were given the choice of bottle water or house water.  The water was served promptly.  Unfortunately we were not greeted by our waiter for over 15 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar.  As we were getting up, our waiter swooped in and laid on numerous excuses as to why we were not greeted by him shortly after we were seated.  He assured us that we would have a fine dining experience and there was no reason for us to go sit at the bar.  We acquiesced and elected to allow him to serve us.  We ordered the surf and turf with a medium rare filet and onions rings.  The king crab was well prepared and the onion rings were very flavorful.  Our steak was overcooked to medium well and charred externally.  We informed the waiter that the steak was overcook and again he patronized us with excuses for the chefs.  He brought us a new steak that was prepared rare instead of medium rare but edible.  The seasonings on the steak were very well blended and flavorful and the texture and cut of the steak was average for a prime filet.  The waiter was quite transparent with his banter with us and it was somewhat awkward.  The manager never came and apologized for poorly cooked steak.  Overall, it is highly unlikely that we will be dining at this establishment again.",

We had purchased tickets to see The Beatles Love Show the night before and so I googled best steak house near the Mirage, and Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak popped up. HUGE fan of Top Chef and Tom Colicchio and us women in the group were super excited to find out we could get a reservation prior to our show. Dressed to the nine's we arrived with empty stomach's knowing we would have a fabulous dinner. We were seated right away and greeted by our server Kim. Kim was very accommodating and went over the menu in detail for us. Jose then greeted us and took our drink order. Soon enough a basket of poblano pepper cheese biscuits and smoked beef jerky arrived at our able for a pre-dinner appetizer; we thought it to be a little strange but amazing non the less (especially the jerky!) The martini's and wine we ordered were right on and Jose checked on us to make sure everything was good. I ordered the Lobster bisque and the rest of the table ordered the Boston Bibb Salad and the Beet Salad. The Lobster bisque came with this amazing puff pastry on top - presentation was very nice! The bisque its self could have been a meal. Had a little different taste then I imagined, almost with a curry taste - but very tasty! The salads all looked fabulous and all at the table gave a thumbs up. Immediately the servers replaced our place settings with fresh ones - this happened throughout the night, AMAZING house service. The main course arrived, along with our sides that are served family style for the table. The 10 oz Filet's were cooked to perfection, but the NY was under cooked and had to be sent back sadly. The onion rings were very good and came with a unique dipping sauce. The potato puree was fabulous, but we were hoping for a larger portion. I ordered the scallops with pickled fig and vanilla sauce. I was disappointed that there were only 4 scallops on the plate for the price....the sauce was amazing! The first two scallops were seared to perfection and unfortunately the other two were under cooked. The NY steak that had to be sent back was still under cooked, but was eaten at any rate since the taste was so good. The ambiance is wonderful, the men at the table complained they could not see.... but us ladies thought it to be romantic. Since there were a couple of birthdays at the table, Kim our server brought out two salty caramel macaroons with a lit candle - very nice gesture. We are still fans of Tom, but slightly disappointed with the two main courses under cooked as you do pay for dinning at its finest.",

    "text": "Ok the quality of the food we ordered was good. Not amazing, but good. However: we reserved a table for Christmas dinner a good month prior to our visit. At 6:45 the restaurant wasn't too busy and we were seated promptly. All 4 of us were looking forward to the $75 prime rib special that included salad, main course and dessert. Well, as soon as we sat down, the waiter told us they were sold out of THREE main courses on the menu, including the prime rib. THREE items. Couldn't believe it. Well, could they substitute the prime rib for another cut of meat?  Well, no they couldn't. Seriously?  They blew it by running out of 3 dishes including the heavily advertised Prix Fixe Christmas dinner by 6:45pm even though they knew had reserved tables for the evening and they couldn't substitute as a gesture of good will?  Nope. Stupid move actually as we would have spent more that way than we ended up spending. Anyway, 3 of us got steak, and the 4th person ordered the $42 scallop dish. From the For the Table section we ordered mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. Then it got laughable. The $42 scallop dish was literally 4 scallops with a little sauce on a big dinner plate. More than $10 per scallop. So ridiculous. Then came the $12 For the Table potatoes. Even funnier. Served in a tiny little dish which was really a healthy serving for 1, possibly 2. Really just a dollop for each of the 4 of us. We couldn't stop laughing. (The spinach was a True For The Table dish).   Add the over-the-top phony waiter and we really couldn't wait to leave. We eat out every Christmas and this meal will definitely be the most memorable as the all time worst. We'll be at the off-strip restaurant eating great prime rib for $16.99 tonight!  Our favorite secret restaurant in Vegas!",

    "text": "Friends wanted to have steak, and they were staying at the Mirage, so we decided to give Heritage a try.  I saw that they only had 3.5 stars on Yelp, but we were already at the hotel and I saw that Tom Colicchio's other steakhouse had 4 stars, so they must use good quality meat.  Overall I was hugely disappointed with the food.   Started with seafood tower, grilled octopus, and oysters.  Seafood tower was pretty basic.  Everything on it tasted reasonably fresh, nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about.  Grilled octopus was one of the best dishes of the night.  Really well grilled and slightly charred on the outside, while also tender on the inside.  The oysters were HORRIBLE.  And some of the worst that I have ever had.  Even they all came out with sauce already added, there was no flavor and each oyster felt thin and dry.    For the main course, my table shared the Japanese wagyu and the 28 Day dry aged bone in Rib Eye.  Both were disappointing.  I'm used to wagyu being thinly sliced with complex flavors and almost melting in your mouth.  What I got tasted like a fatty piece of sirloin.  We asked for the Rib Eye to be cooked medium.  It came out medium well, with almost no red or pink color remaining.  So the meat was tough and had very little flavor.  Even though we were all hungry, we didn't finish it since the steak was so unpalatable.    Service was good and attentive.  We did let them know about our feelings in regards to the food, and they were apologetic.  They didn't do anything about it, but they seemed genuinely concerned.    Perhaps because it is in the Mirage, they can get away with lower quality food.  But I would expect better food from a decent Vegas buffet than from Tom Colicchio's Heritage steakhouse.",

As soon as we walked in it felt like they were giving us the bums rush;   the waiter wanted to take our order before he even asked if we wanted something from the bar!   I ordered a filet medium rare, and my girlfriend ordered a NY Strip medium well, almost no pink.   When the food came out her steak was rarer than mine!   They had 3 shots at it to make it right, while everything else on the table got cold.   They didn't even offer to heat anything else up until we demanded.   On the 3rd attempt at the steak and still being served a red steak, we just left.  A terrible experience.   As a Las Vegas resident,  and frequent patron of the fine dining establishments this town has to offer, you can be sure all my friends will know about this, and I won't be back.   There's just to many great steakhouses in this town to trouble with this one.  The highlight was the complimentary beef jerky!",

With a few friends on Sunday, October 5th, I tried to visit this restaurant and unfortunately didn't even get to try the food. Not because the restaurant was busy, in fact we could have been seated right away, but because the hostess that night around 9:30pm was such a snot. She had more eyeliner than hospitality. Just an awful girl. Bad facial expressions. Really ugly tone to her voice. Rude demeanor. She acted like we weren't good enough to eat there, so we took our money to another, just as expensive celebrity chef restaurant. I'm bummed that I didn't get to eat here though, maybe I'll try one of his other locations on my next vacation.",

So for us, that's a special occasion place.   Now, know that I'm gluten free, dairy free and they were extremely nice, and fun, and attentive, if not totally accurate. Our delightful waitstaff (Farzad and Miguel) were awesome. I'd go back just to hang with them. The restaurant is beautiful and quiet. You can see some of the kitchen/prep, which is fun. And the food was pretty quick, but we were certainly never rushed (mid-week dinner). Now, I did say that I was dairy free, and the small amount in the dressing would be OK, but then my salad came covered in cheese. But it only took a few minutes of me looking around for one of the manager-types to come over and switch it for me quickly. And for dessert, when I asked for a little more sauce, she brought that and more chocolate balls (tiny balls. I can't explain.) And I want to point out for all the other restaurants out there, that when I asked if it was possible to fix, or remove, etc, she could NOT have been more gracious about it. There was no discussion, no attitude, no hesitancy about making things as perfect for us as possible. THAT is what service should be, and I wish all other restaurants would learn that THAT is what brings people back to you.   And that chocolate dessert was pretty amazing. Thank you Chef Tom.",

The hostess brought us to the smallest 2 seat table on a corner that I couldn't sit at. We asked for another table. There was at least four empty 4-tops available but not cleaned. We sat at the bar for over 40 minutes waiting. I was steaming mad but my wife helped me to not blow my top. Once seated we had the whole restaurant to ourselves because everyone was done with dinner. The manager came over and I told him about the wait and he didn't do anything for us. Brutal! When the steaks came, mine was not seasoned at all! Tom is the the first to point this out and will chop anyone who makes a mistake like that. So my one star should be a zero. I would tell anyone to find another restaurant. Don't be fooled, Tom's name is being used, but that must be the only connection to him.",

Due to lack of time (had to go to rock in rio), we didn't say anything and just ate it and left, but we don't plan on coming back even though it's convenient (in the mirage).",

Not necessarily improving them, but certainly twisting them. I cannot fault the food preparation itself, which was skillful and with ingredients of great quality. Slight service issues like forgetting the side foie gras to go on the steak were more or less promptly rectified, but not beyond an apology and delayed, separate serving. The oysters were good quality, but served raw with the option to add the flavors to taste would have probably enhanced the experience. The bone marrow mousse was a bit \"eh\", most of the flavor disappeared, the chips were an interesting, albeit distracting addition. The steaks were of good quality, the wood grill taste maybe a bit overdone/overpowering. The desert (bruleed cheesecake) was an absolute disappointment. Cocktails were ok, if a tad pricy, wine list fairly restricted for by-the-glass options and too ridiculously priced for bottles. All in all not worth the money, we won't be back.",

Second, I tried to order truffle risotto as a side and the waiter said \"no...your table has enough of that.\"  I explained that I wasn't sharing with them, but he was adamant.  Then, my brother in laws $70 steak was bloody rare (bluish-purple), despite ordering a medium.  Unacceptable for a steakhouse in my opinion.

Friday night dinner reservations via OpenTable provided not only good options but an easy change when we were running late.   From the initial greeting to the final goodbye from the GM we had a spectacular experience. One of the best dining experiences ever.   Steaks were tender, juicy, and flavorful. Interestingly, asking for a med-rare rib eye indeed resulted in a suggestion that medium is how they serve it. I was a bit skeptical until I tasted it. It was perfect. Smokey and wood-fire charred perfection. I wanted to chew the bone but since this is fine dining I refrained from doing so. All other steaks were really good... Even the filet requested well-done.   Three sides were tried: onion rings, pomme puree, and broccoli.  Excellent, excellent, excellence.   I don't know what to say about the desserts other than to repeat myself: excellent excellent excellent excellence!!!!  Only regret was not having appetizers. We were ensuring that we'd be able to eat a sweet. I think we missed a part of the great experience. But that was self-inflicted so only I am to blame. Go ahead... Call me a dope  Maybe my judgement was slightly impaired. I had a fantastic drink - the Heritage Manhattan.  All of the staff was fantastic but our waiter, Farzad and team 4, really ensured that all of our needs were satisfied.... Generally before we realized we had a need.  It ain't cheap folks, in fact it's expensive... But money well spent for a fine dining experience.",

One of the best things I had were the Onion Rings. Yes, Onion Rings. They were crispy, had a nice spice on it and not oily.   Finally, what made this place over the top for me is how they treated me as a solo diner in the main dining room. Usually when I dine solo I would sit at the bar. This time I opted for a seat in the main dining room. When I have dined at fine restaurants solo before, they are not as attentive to solo diners. The staff here made me feel welcome and not ignored.

Duck breast- very good Prime 10 oz Filet- good but nothing special Brussel Sprouts, very good but served at the very end of the dinner Fries - normal but ours were cold. Service very slow and everything came out at different times and the wrong order. four glasses of wine - good tab: $350.00 Will we go back ?  NO  Tom: I suggest you visit this \"steakhouse\" more often, it does have your name on it. Atmosphere: very inviting",

Our starter was indeed the octopus plate and we enjoyed every bit - it was a bit on the spicier side for those of you who do not prefer an extra kick. However, I did not mind whatsoever. Last bit qas thay our service was excellent and added to the luster.",

The tables in the dining room are very close together where you feel like you are sharing a table with your neighbor and can hear all of their conversations. The waiter was not helpful with the dinner choice when we asked him as he pushed us to over order.   We ended up ordering the pork belly with fried oysters which was fabulous, bone marrow which was very salty, skewers, and charred octopus. The food was average as I expected a lot more.",

We paired them with Brussel sprouts finished in bacon and apple jam and fries. The sprouts were beyond awesome. The fries were a bit of a disappointment as someone was very heavy handed with the salt. Service was good, every sip of water prompted a refill! It was actually comical. A pretty good experience.",

When we were ready to be sat, the hostess and servers were extremely helpful and offered to transfer our open tabs to the table.   Our group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good.  Everyone's favorite was the octopus though... we liked it so much that we had to order a second order.   For dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag...yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it...  As far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor.  The restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when you're looking for the restrooms. I accidentally almost walked into the kitchen twice trying to find the restrooms...but everything happens for a reason...I ended up getting a tour of the back and front kitchen from one of the GMs. They really knew how to make a girl feel special  ^*^  The service was perfect. The servers not only gave us great suggestions but also brought everything out in a timely manner. I was in and out of a full service meal in less than 2 hours and made it to work with time to spare.   The tour of the kitchen really gave me a sense of how things were done here at Heritage and how seriously they take their craft. I guarantee that I will be back.",

    "text": "I would have loved giving this place five stars, but their prices and the markup on their wine list were negatives to me.  I know this is Vegas and it's on the Strip, but $78 for a bottle of wine I can buy at the grocery store for $15 is a little ridiculous.  That being said, I have to compliment Colicchio for focusing on natural ingredients and the idea of cooking with wood, the way meat should be prepared!  The server, Larry, was excellent. He explained the concepts of the restaurant very well and let us know that the menu is printed every day, so  the specials are included and not called out.   I started with the grilled baby artichoke, and my husband had the garden salad. The artichokes were amazing. They were accompanied by sliced pears, cashews, and a tart dressing that pulled it all together.  For our main course, hubby had the duck, but requested they not add the chorizo.  They accommodated his request and he very much enjoyed the grilled peaches, chili & mint flavors.  I chose the short ribs, which Larry told me had been cooked for over 12 hours.  This was a simply prepared Fall meal with a large chunk of beef accented by roasted heirloom tomatoes and pickled chilis alongside \"pee wee\" potatoes.  I have to say this was probably the best short rib meal I have ever enjoyed.   One more thing to note here......I complained to Larry about the prices of the wines, and he suggested I speak to the sommelier for advice on ordering a good value wine that would suit our taste.  Imagine my surprise when a young woman approached and introduced herself as Kate, the resident Sommelier.  After telling her how disappointed I was that I had to pay so much for a grocery store bottle of Zinfandel, she suggested we try a Syrah from Argentina.  Wow! She nailed it!!!  We very much enjoyed the wine she suggested with both of our meals.  All in all this was a great experience.  The atmosphere, the service, and the menu were all top notch.  Despite the high prices, I'd definitely go back!",

    "text": "I'm never gonna look back Woah, never gonna give it up No, please don't wake me now  This is gonna be the best day of my life at...HERITAGE! - American Authors (best day of my life)  Before I blog about my milestone 300th yelp review, I'll write an actual food review first so people don't have to scroll down (especially on their phones). Keep in mind I've been eagerly waiting a long time for Heritage to open, so we ordered more than we normally would.  Appetizers: (btw they came out incredibly fast, very impressive) 1. Spicy braised pork belly: BEST PORK BELLY I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! You can literally cut through the pork belly with a butter knife, it was so soft. Combined with fried oysters and a nice simple salad, it was a match made in heaven. Honestly, I wanted to order another one right on the spot because it was so good, but I knew that I ordered too much food as it was already!! 2. Wood roasted peaches: sweet + savory combo with the ham and green onions = nice balance of flavors 3. Beef tartare: I had my first beef tartare at his other restaurant and although I liked the other one more, this one wasn't bad (could've been more visually appealing) - eat it with bread and I give it a thumbs up  Main course: 1. Heritage natural prime filet: you definitely taste the difference in the heritage steaks, aged and scrumptious. I would say it was cooked slightly unevenly, with some parts being much more rare than others but it could be because of their open flame grills that they use to cook the steaks 2. Grilled ribeye with wood roasted onions: oh man no complaints here, cooked perfectly and those onions, makes me wanna cry (since they were so good LOL zing!)  Sides: 1. potato puree 2. creamless creamed sweet corn: haha I love corn   Dessert: 1. white chocolate semifreddo: I love white chocolate as well yay  2. peach sorbet: a great palate cleanser  Chef Colicchio has said this on multiple occasions throughout the seasons of Top Chef reminding the contestants that while it's important to serve good food, people come back to restaurants based on the service. He clearly adapted this philosophy at Heritage because service here was impeccable. They had so many staff on hand that it literally seemed like everyone had their own personal server (and the place was around 80% capacity as well). Seeing as how this is Vegas, I can safely say that you can 'bet' I will be back on my next visit :)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  to my dear yelp friends that follow my reviews (or personal blogs as i call them):  My 300th yelp review coincides with my favorite celebrity chef at his newest restaurant in Vegas...couldn't have been more appropriate! I came in June and they were under construction, aiming for a late July open. I came back in late July and it still wasn't open, with a new target date of August. Two weeks later, I couldn't believe it but it still wasn't ready, although they dropped the construction wall and you could see it was almost ready to debut. Fast forward to now, and the dream became a reality...FINALLY! There's so many well-known chefs in Las Vegas, with some having multiple restaurants at different hotels. But Chef Colicchio was the one that made me immerse myself in the culinary world. Top Chef was the reason I started yelping and thus, the reason I love trying different cuisines and restaurants everywhere. Craft (his other restaurant at MGM) was my first fine dining experience in Vegas. I went there ages ago with my older brother and I remember he joked to me saying \"well you already lose a lot playing blackjack, might as well get some good food out of it\" LOL! I laughed really hard but I knew he was right...and the rest is history. Cheers!",

    "text": "Great service! I really wish I remembered our servers name (bald, tan, male)- HE WAS AMAZING! Hope he gets a proper compliment from management. We were immediately greeted with drink menus as well as food. Server was very knowledgeable and able to answer any questions. We had trouble picking between two sides for the steak and went with the Truffle Risotto. You had to REALLY like Parmesan to enjoy it (which luckily my boyfriend and I do). Just a note: the sides are pretty big! You only need to order one if you have two people. We both ordered the filet mignon which were both cooked to temperature. Dessert looked amazing but we were so full from the fillets and risotto! The complimentary bread and beef jerky (yes, beef jerky) were DELICIOUS.   Any member of the staff we encountered was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will recommend and hope to go back during our next trip in Vegas!",

They were cooked perfectly and the reduction on them was tasty. - The octopus app was pretty good (but I've had better). - The collards and pears that came with the duck were flavorful and probably the best part of my meal.  Cons: - The prices for what you get are NOT worth it. - They warned us that they tend to undercooked steaks but then brought out a requested medium rare steak at a perfect medium.  - The duck breast was under seasoned and the fat was chewy and unrendered. - The salads (stupid me for ordering) were under dressed and boring. - No one EVER asked how our meal was. We never saw the server after ordering. While others brought us water, etc., it still was strange for fine dining.  Tom Colicchio, please pack your knives and go!",

This restaurant proved me wrong in every way, I really can't see why they have any 1 or 2 stars. Everything was perfect from start to finish , I recommend the grilled Cesar , Australian wagu and the truffle risotto. Also had a fabulous cabernet to go with our meal and everything was amazing.

    "text": "My partner and I consider ourselves \"foodies,\" addicted to watching all those T.V. cooking competition shows, and always enjoy trying one of the celebrity chef's Las Vegas venues when we're in town.  We were really looking forward to dining at Tom Colicchio's newest entry on this trip.  Sadly, we were a bit disappointed but . . . to be honest . . . it is difficult to say exactly why.  The room is beautifully done - modern yet warm - with an open kitchen that really entertains.  The service was top notch, with good explanations of the dishes and preparation methods, a personable and attentive waiter, and a well-paced meal.  The food was delicious: The bone marrow appetizer was a treat.  The steak was perfectly done, tender and delicious.  The fish was wonderful.  And, the sides were great, with a particular shout-out for the crispy onion rings.  The only criticism I can muster, and it's a personal one, is that the portion sizes seemed a bit large, but I suppose that appeals to most people.  So, everything at Heritage was great.  But, it just didn't seem \"special.\"  Perhaps it's because, at this price point, we expected a more intimate and formal dining room, maybe with table cloths.  Or, perhaps it's because we didn't expect to see fellow diners in jeans, flip-flops and tacky t-shirts.  Whatever the case, we enjoyed our meal but it will probably not be a memorable evening.",

    "text": "Great service and great food/drink.  Place is clean and trendy but do not have the pretentious feel that you can sometimes find around restaurants. Sometimes I would encounter rude staff here and there but this place have a great staff.  All very friendly and personable.  We first grabbed a drink at the bar area.  I got what was something similar to the Moscow mule. I'm a fan of ginger beer and this one was good.  The Dark IPA was nice too. I would recommend it to people that are more of an IPA fan.  For dinner we shared various appetizers and entrees.   Appetizers: Ash-Roasted Bone Marrow, Grilled Octopus and the Smoked Pork Terrine.  The bone marrow was to die for. You would sometimes assume that just putting lobster on top of something does not make it delicious but in this case it was a beautiful way to add on texture to the marrow. When you are done you would want to order more.  Grilled Octopus: Nice, tender and juicy. The sauces that came with it was paired nicely.  I would definitely order this again.  Pork terrine.  This one is served cold.  The flavor is nice by itself and i like it with the pepper jelly. Out of all 3 of the appetizers we ordered I will have to say this is the one is my least favorite but it is still very good.  Dinner:  Duck breast, Braised Short Ribs, Wagyu Ribeye and Oven Roasted Tomatoes.  I can't even pick a favorite because they were all great and there's nothing that I can nitpick about it.  The steak was cooked perfectly to my friend's preference.  The duck breasts were nice and juicy and the short ribs just melts in your mouth.  The tomatoes were fantastic too.  Dessert:  Panna cotta and sorbet   Panna cotta: Beautiful.  Rich and creamy yet not heavy at all.    Sorbet: IMO you can never go wrong with ending a night with a scoop of sorbet to clean your pallet.  You can really flavor of the fruit and smooth texture.  I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu.",

The steak is also aged and marinated for some time before it is offered as an entree. All these details make the steak very, VERY YUMMY :))",

The octopus appetizer was the best octopus I have ever had (and I order it every time I see it on the menu!).  I had the lamb chops and my dining companion had the wagyu skirt steak.  Both were perfectly cooked.  The wagyu could have been a much smaller portion, as it is so rich and buttery that 6-8 ounces is more than enough.  The sides, potato puree and truffle risotto were outstanding.  The potatoes were creamy and buttery, perfect consistency.  And of course we had to get the risotto after seeing Tom Colicchio toss so many people off of \"Top Chef\" for bad risotto! But he clearly has Chef Matt walking the walk, the risotto was perfect!  The best part of the entire experience was the service.  Professional servers who care about the hospitality they provide make all the difference in how I feel about a restaurant.  Caesar and the entire team made us feel like VIPs.  They were warm and personable and funny.  At the end of the dinner, while we enjoyed coffee, Chef Matt came out to thank us and ask for feedback.    All in all a wonderful dinner, will be back next time I am in LV.

It came with roasted asparagus and a creamy potato puree.  For dessert, I got the Blueberry Cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream.  I was extremely pleased with all three courses!

    "text": "I am so disappointed. My husband and I tediously planned our first trip to Vegas (in August 2017) including putting in hours of research on where we would eat. We are big foodies and big Tom Colicchio fans so we knew we wanted to go to one of his LV restaurants.   We opted for Heritage versus Craft because we wanted to have a nice dinner before the LOVE show at the Mirage so this made sense and the menu looked fabulous!  I will start with the good: The hostess was very sweet and the staff seemed attentive enough. The ambience was extremely intimate and romantic. It felt like we were transported to Bali and the dim lighting was very romantic.   Now with the bad: We started with some wine and the cheddar biscuits and in house beef jerky that they served. The biscuits were so bad, hard, cold and stale tasting that I literally asked them to bring us another kind of bread ANY KIND I would have been happy with a slice of white sandwich bread the biscuits were inedible, they came back with some foccacia bread.... it too was inedible. Not a good start to our dining experience.   OK so the beef jerky. What? It was awful, dry, tasteless, crumbly - I mean? I was so confused by the biscuits and jerky as our pre appetizer selection. I love beef jerky - suffice it to say both the bread(s) and the jerky were left untouched.   We had amazing steaks DELICIOUS! The filet melted in your mouth and the wagyu beef steak definitely lived up to it's reputation. Worth every penny..... and there were LOTS of pennies.   The sides were meh - standard cream corn, nothing special.  We were so disappointed with the experience as a whole we opted to skip dessert and save our money for the tables.   We would not consider returning to Heritage Steaks... we may give Craft a chance but one thing we learned is there are SO many amazing dining opportunities in Vegas that when you have a bad experience at one place there are literally hundreds of other places you can get an amazing and memorable meal.",

    "text": "We went here for my early birthday dinner. We didn't catch our scheduled reservation on time but they kept our table despite being 15 minutes late. The hostesses were pleasant and walked us to our table. Our server, Anthony was so fabulous and cute like a teddy bear with a beard. He addressed me by my first name and he was very attentive. I almost ordered a cocktail because of him. \"It's my birthday. I deserve it. It's only going to be one drink\" but self-control took over. I was already going to have red meat and dessert.  Our server gave us some good suggestions and I wanted to try the octopus but nobody wanted to listen to us. We ordered an appetizer, steaks and dessert. Our food came out quickly since we notified Anthony that we were catching a show after dinner.  Braised Pork Belly: Came with fried oysters, horseradish and tomato molasses. Fatty, tender and juicy chunk of pork. The sweet yet tangy tomato molasses cut out some of that fatty feel. The oysters were perfectly executed. 4/5  Grilled Ribeye: With onion balsamic relish and wood-roasted onions. Don't be a princess and expect aged beef. There's more to life than aged anything. 4/5  Tabasco-Pepper Kobe Skirt: 10oz of spicy Kobe beef...and I mean, SPICY. Keep your drinks filled and, bread and sides within reach - you will need them! 3.5/5  Natural Prime Filet: Came with new potatoes. My favorite cut of meat since I'm not a fan of fat unless it's on a pig. If a steakhouse has good filet, then I'm a fan because without the help of fat making a piece of meat tasty, what else do you have to offer to make it taste good? Mine was beautiful, tender, juicy, perfectly medium-rare and lightly seasoned with its natural juices on the plate. They use organic/natural beef meaning: no hormones, no antibiotics - a cow that isn't a freak show 4.5/5  For our sides, we got asparagus and roasted mushrooms. I read about the Brussels sprouts on Vicky Q's review and I wanted to try it but they took it off the menu. The asparagus was very tasty. Some places give you a plate of boring blanched and unseasoned asparagus. This was not the case at Heritage. The mushrooms had variety: enoki, chantrelle, etc. and had a very good garlic flavor.  Lemon Cupcake with Vanilla Bean Frosting: This was complimentary since I was celebrating my birthday. The cupcake was not dry and had a strong lemon flavor. The frosting had specks of vanilla bean.  Sweet Corn Ricotta Fritters: With corn ice cream, blackberries and sweet n smokey creme fraiche. They were sweet and savory at the same time. The creme fraiche made it savory and mildly spicy while the ice cream and blackberries made it sweet. I loved how it's a somewhat unique dessert 4.5/5  I liked this place. They made my early celebration special.",

    "text": "So for our weekend in Vegas, other than the usual shenanigans, we wanted to have one nice meal at a respectable establishment. Doing some initial yelp research, I literally threw up my hands in trying to make sense of all the steak houses and fine dining places that are available in Vegas now. It seems as if almost every celebrity chef has a place on the strip.   That being said, most of them were all tightly lumped together ratings-wise as well, making the choice a bit more difficult. So after spending the afternoon at the Mirage, playing pai gow poker and watching college football at their sportsbook, we decided a decision needed to be made.   After a few exploratory calls around, we noticed that the Heritage looked like a cool place, so we decided to give it a try. Yes, proximity and the most endearing human trait, sloth, carried the day.   That being said, we all really liked Heritage. We opted for a table in their bar area so we didn't have to wait long. Like all the other steakhouses and fine dining options, the restaurant is sleek and shiny, with a pretty badass wood-fired grill in the kitchen (seeing the flames from inside the casino was what initially piqued my interest).  We had just gorged ourselves at Rollin' Smoke for lunch, I was a bit full on meats so I went with something different, two smaller dishes: the Charred Octopus and the Skirt Steak Soy Glazed Skewers.   The charred octopus was aptly named as it had a delicious charred aftertaste from that wood-fired grill and the Steak skewers were on point as well. To go along with my unique choices, I chose to polish it off with a nice Old Rasputin Stout. A fifty dollar meal, which isn't bad (for the strip).   So all in all, a pretty good dining option if you are in the area and like us, a bit too lazy and exhausted to go gallivanting around in search of a steakhouse amidst the largely homogenous selection now on the strip. Everyone else was pleased with their food and they have a pretty cool beer selection as well.",

We arrived about five mins early and it was pretty packed but hey we have a reservation. Waited for about 15-20 mins to be seated which was annoying because other groups with no reservation were seated before us. We ended up being in the bar area which is ok except we made a reservation for the Resturant part as well as who wants a date night where you can't talk. Fast forward to our server being too busy to speak and can't get drinks or orders waited about 15 mins for her to finally ask if we wanted drinks so mention of specials or any suggestions on the menu finally we order duck was dry and had a cold side not sure why that is but ok. Wasn't the worst dinner but wasn't close to being a good dinner we will most likely be back maybe it was just a bad night for them. Hopefully next time we are here it will be a better experience.",

At the start of our experience, it was great, everyone was super nice and accommodating.  We ordered the seafood tower and a couple of appetizers to start.  They were all good. Our glasses became empty and all our starters were cleared awhile ago, we were sitting there staring at one other waiting for  the main courses.   Main course: Filet mignon: it was cooked well, nothing special. ribeye: if I ever go back, I'd rather get the ribeye. mushrooms: yum corn: okay potato puree: yum  Here's why I'm giving them 2 stars.  After the main courses were delivered, we did not see the waiter again.  We actually ended up taking pitchers of water from the counters to fill our own water glasses.  Oh that's not the end of it, there were food runners and other employees who were busing our plates watching us fill our glasses.  I'm sorry to sound snobby, but if I'm at a higher end establishment, I expect great service.",

    "text": "Probably one of the best filets ever.  And free of hormones and antibiotics.  10 ounces of hunky, perfectly seasoned meat, with gorgeous potatoes on the side, simple, delicious, unadorned for $52.  Not bad Chef Tom.  Meat as it was meant to be.  Your house filtered water, however, is fine, but should be FREE.    Service was perfect: from the hostess who obliged when we asked for a more private corner table to our server, who was excited about the food and peppered semi-corny jokes throughout the evening.  He tried.  The sommelier could be a little more refined and knowledgeable about her craft.   The portions are REALLY big here, so order accordingly and share: -Grilled romaine salad, loved soft cooked egg and the medley of greens -Beef tartare, a little creamy and spicy from the kimchi, interesting, not my favorite -Roasted Salmon, nicely crispy skin, like BLISTERED, like a kettle chip, loved, sides are big and can get a bit vinegary and repetitive -BBQ Foie Gras, rich fatty goodness, paired with blueberries and peanuts -Blueberry Pie, great crystalized crust, topped with lemon thyme ic and not too sweet -Strawberry Sticky Cake, really good, must order, on the sweeter side  We also ordered a scoop of the lemon thyme ice cream, but wouldn't have if we knew it came on the pie, server should have mentioned.    Trendy beans, Stumptown, our espressos were just okay.    One of the better steakhouses on the strip.  More relaxed then Craftsteak and more variety in the menu.  Mirage is finally upping their game in the dining scene.",

Since they charged $58 for a 10oz Fillet I would have thought they'd go the extra step & actually get our orders right. The server seemed less then interested in service us & it reflected in her quality of service. It just seems like since my last visit to Las Vegas the service quality & friendliness of the wait staff has suffered. I would not go to this place again.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner on our last night in Vegas with family. The salads we got as starters were pretty good but then we got to the main course. To start , the steaks some wanted to order they were out of for the day so we made different selections. I had a 10oz filet that my first bite was a bit dry and chewy and seemed over cooked (I had asked for medium rare). Tried another bite, still not great so I had my husband try a bite and he was not impressed either. My mom has the same and hers was dry. Definitely NOT a $60 steak! Took our waiter forever to come back and check on how our meals were. We told him how disappointed we were and he went and got a manger who pretty much said \"we'll take care of the steaks, don't give up on us\".  We figured we would be paying for our salads and drinks but the waiter has taken forever to come back. I do NOT recommend ever patronizing this establishment.  I have had a better steak for 1/3 the price at a chain.",

The other steaks at the table looked good, mine was over cooked (ordered rare warm in the middle). We showed the waiter the steak and he said \"nothing I can do... ribeyes are fatty.  What do you want us to do throw out the meat\".  Ummm... YES!  Throw it out, feed it to a dog!  Later the waiter was in the restroom. After using the toilet he quickly ran his hands under the water.

The blend of the wine with the food just lingered.  As it mellowed it just got better. It smoothed out as you drank it. Some may like it some may not but with our dinner it was a perfect match.

    "text": "From powerhouse chef Tom Colicchio comes a fine dining backyard cook out.    Huh?  Simple, everything is cooked in or over natural burning wood.  The menu has changed over the years, making it more approachable to the everyday carnivore.  Instead of focusing on specific breeds of cattle, simply think of heritage beef as naturally reared, hormone and antibiotic free that may be grass fed or grass finished.  It includes the requisite American, Australian, and Japanese Wagyu.  Topping the starters, the beef tartare.  Topped with pickled mushrooms and kimchee and drizzled with chili oil, the non classic preparation is truly mouthwatering and awakens the palate.  Sadly the charred octopus suffers from TMS (too much stuff) syndrome.  The octopus is tender with a nice bitterness but the overabundance of roasted peppers and leeks drowns its flavor.  To the beef.  Steaks are very well trimmed, USDA prime or higher, heavily seared, and cooked to temp.  The catch, all are cooked over wood burning grills that imparts a smoky bitterness.  The cooking technique works best with dry aged cuts as the bitterness of the smoke heighten the umame finish.  Grass fed cuts also work as the mineral taste of the meat becomes more complex with the smoke.  That said, top props to the dry aged ribeye and grass fed ribeye.  Ballin out of control?  The dry aged A5 wagyu (brand unknown) is truly an indulgence.  At $20/oz, 4oz minimum it's one of the best priced examples on the Strip.  Dry aging imparts a slight umame finish to the sweet beef.  Very high heat grilling seals in the melting fatty goodness.  The resulting steak, juicy, tender, and rich with clean tasting, non cloying fat.  Excellent and something I've only had in Tokyo.  For non beef lovers, the duck breast is king.  Marinated in a sweetened soy, fermented black garlic, ginger, and chili sauce then grilled rare over an open fire.  Juicy, earthy, charred bitterness, with just the right amount of gamey, mineral complexity.  Outstanding.  Excellent wine list.  Good sampling of old and new world wines with some vintage depth.  Typical resort pricing.  The Heritage Manhattan is a must for any brown libation lover.  Mesquite smoked cherry juice.  Need I say more?  Service is steakhouse friendly and efficient.    All this raving, why not five stars?  Personal preference.  The palate tires from all the grilled flavors, leaving a one dimensional background of smoky bitterness.  Dishes with acidic zing could break the monotony but I don't eat my vinaigrette dressed salad with my steak.",

    "text": "Well, sadly, I never thought I'd be giving this place 1 star.  I was a fan.  BIG TIME.  Gave it 5 stars before, and we came here every single time we come to Vegas (about 2x a year), and consistently great.   This was just bad enough to not go back and give it another chance..  We had reservations - we were on time (right after Beatles Love).  We were greeted and shown to our seats, which was the corner table for 2, along the bench, along the hallway/passway that connects the front of the restaurant to the back.  Ok, not my first preference, especially when they had over 1/2 the restaurant open, but it wasn't near a bathroom, so it was ok.  As I was trying to work my way back to the bench, between 2 tables, (I'm not a size 0), a waiter came buy, was giving me the menu, as I'm trying to maneuver a table and cushions on the couch, so I can sit.  I had to grab the menu's put it on the table, since he kept them held out.  Then he asked for our drinks (still not seated).  I always LOVED the Tom's Collins, so I asked for that, and he seemed surprised, then he repeated, a tom collins?  I said, no, the signature drink, Tom Colicchio's drink?  He still seemed confused, and I asked for more time.  He came back again, and I remembered the name right, Tom's Collins.  Now, I KNOW THIS DRINK.  I order it at the bar, when I am gambling, that is how much I like it, this is what I drink when I am at the Mirage.   A bit later - my drink comes.  It's not my drink, first there is no cucumber - and it has a Luxardo Cherry (never have I seen any cherry in a gin drink, but ok.. So I don't drink from it, cause I'm waiting for waiter to come back and say, this isn't the Tom's Collins.  (ok, I know this sounds SOO snooty and picky, but it's an $18 drink, I want what I want.)    So he never comes back, and I was thirsty and took a sip.  I can't even say it was Hendricks, which is one of my faves..    Eventually, I flag down the main waiter, and ask him if the Tom's Collins has been changed - he says no, and I explain, how it usually has a cucumber, fever tree tonic, and his reply is maybe they didn't cut cucumbers today..  He wasn't joking though..    Later the right drink came to my table, and they did not charge me for the first one, which, I didn't finish, but it was the right thing to do.  Ok, back to other reasons on why we won't go back.   When we decided to come to Mirage for the weekend, since it was an average of 111 every day, we decided never to leave the building.  Ok, perfect, plenty to eat & do at Mirage.  So we decided either Stax or Heritage.  It was a no brainer - Heritage, especially since I saw a few appetizers that intrigued me, the Whiskey Onion Dip (bone marrow) and Steak Tartare.    So that is what we ordered for started.   Well, these 2 were the most gimmicky meals I have had in ages.  The dip was in a bone, and it was an onion dip.  I didn't think the flavor stood out other than toasted onion dip I get in the powder form & mix with sour cream, to accompany that was home made potato chips.   You couldn't dip the chip into the bone for 2 reasons.   1. The chips were beyond soggy, soft and in desperate need of salt.  They stuck to your molars cause of the soft/chewiness - and not in a good way.   Either the oil wasn't hot enough when they were fried, or they were left out for a day or so.  So you had to dig into the hollow of the bone for your dip.      Now for the steak tartare.  Obviously, whoever made this just got a smoking gun, cause it was OVER saturated with smoke.  No where in the description was it listed as a 'smokey' flavor, and even if it did, it was SO heavy handed.   My husband uses a smoking gun in foods, this was NOT the same.  It was almost fake tasting, like liquid smoke.  I didn't return it, but I didn't eat it.     The steaks came.  Prior to the steaks coming, a waiter dropped of 3 sauces.  We didn't know what they were.  I have food allergies, so I didn't want to taste to see what it was.  When they brought the meat, waiter just put plates in front of us, and was walking away, when I stopped him to ask what they were..  Sauces for the steak, and he walked away.  No explanation what they were.  We figured out it was a chimichurri, horseradish and like an A1.  My filet was perfect.  The only good part of my meal, and my husband's bone in rib eye also perfect.  Again, the only 2 good things. (He did like his drink).   Side dishes were roasted cream corn & onion rings.    The roasted cream corn was like it was in okra.  It wasn't cream.  It was a gelatinous substance (clear) and canned corn.  This was CANNED.  No question.   We didn't finish that.  The onion rings are signature, but also had a heavy hand with the paprika.  We left the sides, but finished the meat.  Didn't even want to bother with dessert.  Or a 2nd drink.   If you want a steak, and a steak only - this is your place.   But, there is too much competition, to just order 1 thing here.    Sorry, but we won't be going back.",

I had the 16 oz Bone in Rib Eye, done medium and I have to say that the smokey flavor from the wood grilling is simply amazing a MUST TRY!! all steaks are served with a tamarind, chimichurri and horseradish sauces for you to dip.  Tamarind is the best flavor yet.  My wife ordered the Wagyu 10 oz Flat Iron Steak and she loved it. We ordered sides as well but the steaks over power everything else. When you see my pics you will notice that I always have a cut into my steaks, I always check the temperature and texture to make sure it was done to my liking. Staff that I would like to give a shout to would be Miguel who was very attentive with us and very knowledgeable with the menu and Victor the nicest and best bartender his suggestions were right on.",

    "text": "My friend is a huge fan of cooking shows, top chef, and Tom Colicchio... last year we stayed at the Mirage and decided to have our final last dinner at Stack.  Stack was good, but definitely not a memorable meal like this place provided.  This year we stayed at the Flamingo but I came across a $30 coupon (when you spend $75) playing MyVegas slots on Facebook so my friend and I came back this year to have dinner on our first night in Vegas.  This place absolutely sits on my top 5 list of all my meals in Vegas.  Expensive...Yes, but you get what you pay for here.  This is top notch quality food.  The cheapest glass of wine on the menu is $18 but in all honesty, this cab was the smoothest among cabs I've ever had to pair with my steak.  I was so excited about how great the wine was, I couldn't wait for dinner!  Before my steak, my friend and I shared a salad which was the perfect size for two.  He ordered the brisket which was one of the highlighted features of the menu, and I got a steak...both were amazing!!! Our server answered all our questions and gave excellent recommendations.  And...for dessert, I'm still talking about this blueberry cobbler over a week later!  Again, suggested by our server, the blueberry cobbler is paired nicely with toasted marshmallow flavored ice cream.  The cobbler isn't too sweet and pairs so well with the ice cream!!!   I was amazed by my experience here! If you're looking for a top notch quality excellent meal...this is your place!!!",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of Craftsteak at the MGM for many years, I was looking forward to trying Heritage Steak at Mirage. It made total sense as we were going to see Cirque's Beatle show \"Love\" (BTW don't waste your money - we walked out).  The service was great, but let's talk about the food.  My wife ordered the pork belly.  She liked it, but the forkful I tried was dry and tasteless, however, the fried oysters served on the plate was excellent.  I ordered the onion soup... not your usual one from the 60's.  This soup was made from char roasted onions, roasted garlic and escargot.  Very good for a change, but I doubt I would order it again.  We split the Tabasco Kobe skirt steak.  We ordered it medium. 1/3 of it was medium 2/3 well done.  It was also over rubbed so that the Tabasco overpowered the flavor of the steak.  Don't get me wrong, I love hot food, but this had me sweating.  This would have been great on a taco... but that would be a sin.  The side of asparagus was tasteless and so woody, that it was inedible.  The bit of fingerling potatoes on the steak plate were cooked perfectly, but too greasy to eat.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, as we saw some great looking onion rings and other dishes going to other tables.  The bottom line is that I am at Mirage and hungry, I would go back to their large bar which has sports going on their TV's and order some appetizers, but this will not be a repeat destination... I'll head to Craftsteak!",

    "text": "We have eaten at Craft Steak several times and we love it.  We decided to try Heritage and we were completely underwhelmed. We live in Las Vegas and enjoy trying all the great restaurants in town.  We started with the grilled romaine and upon first bite it was so sour that none of us could eat it.  The waiter noticed we weren't eating it and we advised that the dressing tasted sour. He brought out the grilled octopus, which was tough but had a good flavor.  Because of the sour taste in my mouth nothing really tasted good. The french onion soup was the best thing we ordered.  The porterhouse was tough, quite a bit of grizzle. Completely sub-standard for a top steak house.  The braised brisket was tasty, but way too much fat.  I understand brisket needs to be fatty for flavor but the chef should have trimmed some off before serving. The pudding served with it had no taste, not even sure what it was.  The sides were standard, nothing outstanding. Brussle sprouts were ok but cauliflower was under seasoned. The onion rings were touted as being the best in town, not.  They were greasy.  I love dessert, we ordered the s'mores, they were ok.  Apple tartin was so tasteless we left the entire pie. Was not worth the calories. It was my son's birthday and they serve a mini cupcake as their dessert. Really, just say happy birthday.  Before I wrote a review I called a manager the next day to discuss my concerns.  She basically said all their food is made from scratch daily and is always consistent. She advised she would discuss with the chef our issues and get back to me.  She never returned my call. I feel like I was blown off. Locals keep these restaurants busy all year long, not just during convention season. I am shocked that Tom Colicchio would have this kind of management. I feel like Craft Steak and Heritage are completely different owners. Different food, service even ambience.  TWO thumbs down.",

Prefecture\".....  Needless to say, but I will: I didn't order the steak.  The menu changed slightly from the last time I was here; Overall it was an OK experience, but rounding out at about 100-120/pp it just wasnt up to par with other options on the strip at that price.  For example, they had a roasted bone marrow with sweet corn slaw and lobster, which is now updated to an apple slaw - but the apple slaw just doesnt work.  I loved the cut of beef with the Tabasco rubbed kobe skirt, but this time it was overpowering.",

I ordered the Heritage Bone-in Rib eye and although it was cooked well, just didnt have any real memorable moments and actually bored me quite a bit.   I love simplicity when it comes to steaks, salt and pepper. My brother in law got the brisket and it was topped off with all these strange foreign material that it looked like an alien barfed all over it. It looked like wet chia seed gelatin and swiss chard greens.   My wife got the filet mignon and it was \"meh\" in her words.   My sister in law got the regular rib-eye which was topped off with baby onions and she didnt finish much of it, just like she didnt finish a majority of her baby salad ($17).  Service was good, waterboy was on it though.  Bone-in ribeye $61, filet $59... $120 plus tax and tip... way over priced  I still enjoy Vic and Anthony's at the Golden Nugget... now their rib eye is outstanding",

Sure, the waitress deserved every penny of the shiny dime I left her for being such a perky junior-high school student but not much else (\"oh, sorry for the 20 minute wait, I didn't see you\") but the bartender who poured the dregs of a $20 house wine with a \"take it or leave it\" smirk on his face and a chef who lazily thawed out a $60 steak (cold & under-cooked) you'd think would have learned more at their apprentice stint at MacDonalds.

So...I went along, despite the fact that \"medium\" is a temperature generally reserved for fat tourists from Kansas who are trying to get crazy and deviate from their usual \"well done... plus 10 minutes\" style of steak.  The steak came and it was medium. Most of it was dry and terrible, though several bites were tasty. In other words: it was a steak cooked at medium.... It was the worst steak i've ever tasted that came from a \"steakhouse\", because it was cooked to shoe leather consistency.   Here's my recommendation for this restaurant: if you're serving morons who are terrified of even a sliver of pink, then you might as well just quit.",

When we were ready to be sat, the hostess and servers were extremely helpful and offered to transfer our open tabs to the table.   Our group shared a few appetizers that were pretty good.  Everyone's favorite was the octopus though... we liked it so much that we had to order a second order.   For dinner our table decided to stick to only ordering from the heritage steaks. We got the skirt, wagyu, and the filet. The wagyu was obviously the best but that pricetag...yikes. Regardless the piece of meat was a work of art. It was incredibly tender and pretty much just melted in your mouth. There was very little chewing that had to be done. Probably the most rich and flavorful piece of cow I've ever consumed. Puts a smile on my face thinking about it...  As far as sides go, nothing stood out but the brussell sprouts. Very good flavor.  The restaurant is modern and clean with dark wood accents. Lighting sets the mood for a nice dinner out. Overall I loved the layout, however it's a bit confusing when youre looking for the restrooms. I accidentally almost walked into the kitchen twice trying to find the restrooms...but everything happens for a reason...I ended up getting a tour of the back and front kitchen from one of the GMs. They really knew how to make a girl feel special  ^*^  The service was perfect. The servers not only gave us great suggestions but also brought everything out in a timely manner. I was in and out of a full service meal in less than 2 hours and made it to work with time to spare.   The tour of the kitchen really gave me a sense of how things were done here at Heritage and how seriously they take their craft. I guarantee that I will be back.",

And every staffer watched out for us. Turns out that most of the menu was naturally gluten free.  We started with heirloom tomatoes, micro basil, balsamic and a perfectly delicious cheese that melted in our mouths.  We split the bone in rib eye medium rare for our main course. We also split fire roasted asparagus and the best fries I've eaten outside of my own. Everything was absolutely fabulous and worth every dime.  The dessert menu was lengthy, and when we were informed that they make all the ice creams, sorbets and sherbets fresh the only question was what flavor. We finally settled on sharing a serving of Strawberry Hibiscus Sherbet which was topped with a little flavored sugar-I think it was hibiscus. A great ending to our yummy meal.   I had a Shirley Temple with dinner. The cherries were dark red. Another supper tasty detail. And that's were these Heritage Steak sets a pretty high bar. I enjoyed my meal here more than The meal I ate at  Ruth Chris New York.   We very much enjoyed the design and open kitchen concept. The decaf coffee was the only thing that wasn't perfect, and it was so out of character compared to everything else that I had to drop off a half star-I give 4.5 stars.",

I play My Vegas and used my 30k points for $30 off Dinner at the heritage steakhouse. The hostesses were both extremely rude, took us to a dirty table in the bar after we had told her we wanted dinner. She left us standing at the dirty table for a while, smiled and sarcastically said 'you can stand there until someone cleans it for you\" then I saw the hostess go to the server and direct him to a table in the bar that had been sat after us. I was upset and immediately went to him and said we needed to be acknowledged, our table cleaned, and we should provided a menu. He grabbed a menu and threw it down on the dirty table at us. It landed next to the check from the previous table. The three of us immediately got up and went to the Concierge who directed us to the front desk manager. The front desk manager offered us a $75 credit at the Stack Steakhouse in the hotel. He sent us each a delicious complimentary shot from the bar, and personally came to check on us. I cannot say enough about how badly Heritage treated us.  SKIP TOM COLICCHIO\"S HERITAGE STEAKHOUSE!!!! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!",

We also had the saute mushrooms as well.  In addition the Chef sent out some homemade beef jerky before our meal, which was an added treat.

We were there at approx 8pm and there was ample seating in the lounge/bar area (on 12/30).   Location/Restaurant:  Located in the middle of Mirage's casino floor.  It is a nice set up with a modern twist.  I really liked how the main restaurant was decorated.  The kitchen is open for full viewing of the chef and the steaks cooking.  Another cool thing is that the restrooms are all private (3 I believe).   Service:  Fair.  Our waitress in the lounge was friendly and prompt.  However, she didn't bring or offer bread to us.  We stopped another server in the main restaurant and asked him about the restaurant's concept and he took the time to really explain things to us.  So if you want better service, I would def suggest eating in the main restaurant.  The lounge was definitely less formal. Food:  There was 4 of us and we ended up splitting the 35oz Heritage rib eye (aged 28 days) and 4 sides (brussels sprouts, mushrooms, onion rings, and fries).  They ran out of the porterhouse (???).  They did not charge a splitting fee and even cut the steaks up for us.  The steak was really really good and juicy and I would def get it again.  The star of the side dishes was the brussel sprouts and onion rings.  The brussel sprouts had nice big pieces of bacon and was really really good.  The onion rings had a really nice and light batter and was delicious.  Dessert was also pretty good.  They recommended the fig dessert and that was good.  The steaks were good but I would still prefer CUT over this place.",

    "text": "Had an AMAZING meal with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday last weekend on May 3. This was my first visit to a restaurant by Tom Colicchio. The restaurant is located right in the Atrium of the Mirage. It looks a little exposed from the casino, but that's just the bar--the actual restaurant is deeper in and mostly hidden from view from the casino, providing a nice romantic atmosphere. We had a few drinks at the bar before being taken to our table, and the bartenders were friendly and chatty and made us laugh a lot. The restaurant itself is decorated in a modern, chic but cozy style with huge stacks of wood lining the entire back wall by the kitchen in an impressive display, and wine racks lining the other wall on the back side near a private dining room. Lots of dark wood and dim lighting complete the experience. Our server (her name escapes me) was just fantastic! We were a rowdy group and she took our energy and matched it, bantering wittily with the smart-asses we brought along, providing great suggestions, and also leaving us alone when we were relaxing and chatting. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered a great wine selection. The wines by the glass selection is small but I really enjoyed my chardonnay recommended by the waitress, as did my dining companions. We shared a seafood platter for an appetizer, and my husband ordered the quail skewer as well. The seafood was delectable and fresh, and while this was marketed on the menu for two people, the six of us enjoyed it without getting stuffed for the entrees. Hubby said the quail was phenomenal and wished he had ordered more  (me too, I didn't get to try it!) For dinner, I had the 10 oz. heritage filet, and I can honestly say it was the best steak I've ever had. A friend had the lobster, another friend had the skirt steak and scallop skewers, hubby had the tabasco pepper strip steak, and the other boys split the gigantic 32 oz cote de bofe (dry-aged bone-in ribeye). Everyone was extremely impressed with their entrees and we gladly shared bites, oohing and aahing over how delicious everything was.  We shared a few sides, but I had filled up and didn't get to the them. The rest of my party raved over the asparagus and roasted mushrooms. The birthday girl got a free mini-cake that was yummy, and our companions enjoyed the panna cotta and ice cream desserts. It wasn't a cheap meal,  but we had an amazing time both due to the food and our server. She really made the meal a special experience I'm sure we will all remember, and I would definitely return (if my budget allows) to Heritage Steak next time I visit Vegas. Truly five stars!!!",

I ordered tomato burrata flatbread, hubby had brisket sliders, friend had the burger. When the food came they brought me a tomato salad instead of the flatbread...apologized then it took awhile to get my correct order. Wish I never got it! It was awful....smaller than a lean cuisine pizza ($18)...tomatoes tasted like roasted red peppers, tons of oil & salt.... Did not eat it. I did eat some of the tomato salad they brought by mistake because they said they couldn't take it back. Looked better than it tasted. Brisket sliders were not warm & buns on the salty side. Weren't sure if it was meant to be like that so he just ate them. The burger was good. When the bill came we were charged for the salad I didn't order. They did however take it off the bill along with the flatbread. Needless to say it did not meet my expectations.",

Reservations worked well and we were promptly seated - right in front of the 500 steak grilling area.   The radiating heat and the scent of burning steaks was not exactly the best seat in the house.   I asked to be moved; to their credit, we were relocated to another part of the restaurant.  We both started with Chopped Endive salads.  Fresh and crisp, but a bit light on the dressing.   Main course was the 10 oz Fillet for my wife and the 10 oz Australian Wagyu Flatiron for me.   Both steaks were well prepared and served medium rare, as ordered.  No complaints about quality.  Both steaks were tender, juicy, well seasons and both were at least the listed 10 oz.  After exchanging sample bites, we decided that my Magyu was the winner.  For sides, we ordered Grilled Potatoes and Market Vegetables which turned out to be asparagus.  The potatoes have a caramelized onion cream topping that was surprisingly sweet.  The grilled asparagus was excellent.  Both sides were plenty big for sharing.    The staff was helpful, friendly and attentive.  The dining area is a bit dated in this age of flashy Las Vegas resort dining and it was a bit too close to the casino for my liking.  The din from the casino floor constantly reminded me that I was paying $200+ for a casino restaurant.",

Our waiter was not only friendly but also very enthusiastic in describing what was on the menu. Our only disappointment was in the food itself. I had a ribeye steak that was all fat, no meat. What meat there was, was soft but tasteless. It was under seasoned. It was only made decent by adding steak sauce and a lot of salt. My friend's filet was tender but again under seasoned and flavorless. A third friend had the pork which was described as \"amazing \" by the waiter but was dry and not to his liking. The deserts were sort of childish. They were more like candy than the sophisticated deserts one would expect in a restaurant of this supposed caliber. Over priced and under whelmed. Stay away!",

    "text": "we went down to Heritage Steakhouse at 10pm on Oct 2, because the front desk told us they close at 10:30. However, the restaurant host said they were already closed and then proceeded to put up some ropes. It was 10pm. I called Mirage management, but nothing was done. Unfortunately we had another problem at Heritage on Saturday Oct 4 around Noon. We politely asked that 1 tv be tuned to a football game. Nobody else was in the bar. The bartender said he did not know how to change the channel. He was an asian guy, somewhat tall. I found this unacceptable. Worse was his rude attitude and the way he handled it. I spoke to the manager, but she did not seem to do anything other than take 30 minutes to finally figure out how to change the channel.",

Prices are ridiculous--minimum $18 for a glass of wine or cocktail.  No bread unless you request it!!!  (And they don't tell you that). My Kobe brisket was flavorful but dry. My wife's lobster was overcooked and chewy and the polenta had no flavor.  This was not what we expected from him.  I guess he figures his name alone carries enough weight.  When we went to Emerils (at MGM) here in Vegas, it was almost half the price the many times better!   If this meal was on Top Chef, he would be told to pack his knives.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love your place Tom because I love your show but it was awful. I had just ate at Gordon Ramsey's steak the night before and it was so good I almost cried;). So I thought well surely Tom can top Gordon...nope.  I had the onion soup to start, it was like the greasy drippings left over from a chargrilled roast put in a bowl and then served. The taste was so peppery that my lips were on fire! The chunks of meat were so chargrilled it was like licking a grill. Weird too because I didn't see or taste any onion! Ok so after a few bites of that mess I said ok let's hope steak is better. I ordered 10 oz filet which is always too much but since I barely ate soup I had room. Steak was cooked perfectly but had that peppery taste!! I am not huge pepper fan i use it to cook with but it just overwhelmed that steak. I ate both rolls trying to put out fire on my lips!!  I also had the strawberry stout which was awesome.  I didn't bother with dessert because I was afraid it might be drenched in pepper! My server was great but she never took away a plate so she didn't notice that I wasn't eating the food and I am not a complainer unless something is dangerous so I paid my huge bill and left.  There are too many awesome steak places in Vegas to go here. Cut, 9ine, gr are excellent if you are in steak mood.",

I had a Wagyu Strip that was perfectly cooked and had a richness and simple deliciousness that I'll remember for a long time. All our courses were awesome and perfect service to boot. Special thanks to James our server. And the venue is built into the Mirage jungle so it's a super unique view and vibe. Very very well done.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited The Heritage just before Labor Day weekend 2014.    Overall assessment: The Heritage yielded a great dining experience with an intimate setting, but the food was just GOOD not AMAZING. I would recommend The Heritage, but take it with a grain of salt.  The food tasted like what you would expect from the contestants on Top Chef, not the expert judging panel!  Pros - Atmosphere is calm and inviting. Nestled behind a screen of trees in the atrium of the Mirage--you hardly know you're in a casino! - Staff is super friendly, respectful and extremely attentive.  My water glass was never less than half full.  You can tell you're in a fancy restaurant by how professional the staff is, and they knocked it out of the park. - Portions were perfect.  Some entrees come with sides, others do not. - Wood fire theme made the food taste simple yet delicious. - The dinner rolls...honestly one of the BEST parts of the meal.   - The arugula salad was perfect--peppery greens, creamy goat cheese and spiced pecans made for a classic rendition executed perfectly. - My boyfriend's steak was beautifully plated.  You could really taste the natural flavors of the beef (local) with the wood fire cooking method.  The side of mushrooms he ordered were some of the best mushrooms I've ever ate. - The Sauvignon blanc and Sauvignon red were some of the best wines we've had, and just $17 a glass.  Highly recommend those two.  Cons - Lobster dish was a little dry, and needed some acidity.  When you pay $56 for a plate of lobster, you hope it would be perfectly seasoned.  However, needed a twist of lemon and a minute or two less in the oven. - Steak entree was good, but again, not spectacular as you would expect for a high price.  Hope this helps!",

I ordered the halibut that was said to come with fingerling potatoes and the pile of potatoes was about the size of 5 small grapes. We spent well over $100 and left hungry.

The asparagus was too lemony and the onion rings too hot, duck breast too much cumin and the filet was better with ketchup, just to round out the flavor profiles that didn't work or needed help.  VG wine list (worth one of the stars).  Expected high price and mediocre service.",

    "text": "RUN.  Don't walk.  Don't waste your time with other restaurants.  This is the experience you want when you visit Las Vegas.  I had an incredible time at Heritage this past weekend; you'd never know that it just opened a week ago.    The food at Heritage Steak was impeccable.  We ordered the onion soup and octopus to start--loved the octopus and the accompanying sauce and had ordered it per our servers recommendation, and it was excellent, and the soup had a really great smoke to it, and the presenation was clever--they brought you the dish and meat in which the soup was eventually poured.  We also tasted the squab skewers (very delicate taste), the hamachi, and the ham with peaches.  The presentation of the hamachi was really impressive.  I never take pictures of food, and get annoyed when people do, but for the first time, I felt moved to take a picture because the presentation of the hamachi was really beautiful.  Its taste lived up to its presentation.  The Iberico ham was incredible, so tasty.    For our main courses, we ordrered the short ribs and and the porterhouse.  The short ribs in combination with the heirloom tomatoes really takes Colicchio's traditional recipe that he's well known for to a new level.  To me, that was the stand out dish of the night--it's combination was unusual and perfect.  We had the sweet corn as our side and it was really bursting with sweetness.   For dessert, we had peach galette with ice cream, the sweet corn fritters, a spice Bundt cake, and the panna cotta.  I loved the panna cotta.  Not too sweet and light and filled with taste.  The sweet corn fritters reminds you how sweet corn is.  The galette was warm and smoky from being cooked in the wood fire.    The sommelier had us covered, from champagne to cocktails back to champagne.  The general manager was ever present, warm and welcoming to all of his guests.  Service was excellent, everyone was so friendly, helpful, courteous, positive, and knowledgeable. Never once did our water go past 14 cup empty, never did our empty plate linger on the table.  Everyone had a great smile.   Highly, highly recommended.",

    "text": "Fire. Good.   You would never know this place is just getting its feet under it; the service and food were on par with Craft. Clearly chef Colicchio has this \"opening restaurants\" thing down.   Started with the roasted peach appetizer, featuring iberico ham and fresh arugula. The peaches and ham were terrific, but surprisingly the arugula was the star of the show. Super fresh, and it had that great peppery burst. Perfect size to share and still have room for dinner.   Our entrees were the grilled ribeye and the braised short ribs. Both were amazing, with the ribeye being the big winner. A nice, thick piece of steak, cooked and seasoned perfectly, the onion relish adding flavor without distracting from the steak. I would never think to have roasted onions as the side dish, but they were delicious on their own. Who knew?  The short ribs were fall apart tender, they don't give you a steak knife and you don't need one. Again, beautifully prepared and presented, the tomatoes and potatoes were great compliments.   We paired our steaks with an Old Rasputin stout, I recommend you do the same.  Ricotta fritters and white chocolate semifreddo for dessert, both were appropriately sized, not overly sweet, and we enjoyed sharing. Worth noting that the coffee they serve is terrific, too.   The service was fantastic, they knew the menu inside and out, were attentive and fun to talk to without being overbearing, and we never felt rushed.   One tiny complaint is that they really jammed a lot of tables in the space (which is beautiful) and when it fills up it's a bit asses to elbows. Overall the prices were reasonable for this quality of food & service, so perhaps that's the tradeoff.   Highly recommended.",

The sea bass was delicious, different than the normal Chilean sea bass typically served. It was masterfully paired by Anthony with a crisp, African Sauvignon blanc. The filet was soft and flavorful, don't recommend anything more than medium well. We added mushrooms as a side and they were a little disappointing, but the potato puree and asparagus were amazing. (If you like butter). To top it all off, the blueberry cobbler was to die for!!!  I don't even prefer to eat dessert, so it takes a lot for me to eat a whole dessert by myself. It was delicious!   Ambiance of this restaurant is nice, the open air, wood design is relaxing and pretty, but can be noisy as it is located in the main lobby atrium of the hotel.  Overall good experience!",
