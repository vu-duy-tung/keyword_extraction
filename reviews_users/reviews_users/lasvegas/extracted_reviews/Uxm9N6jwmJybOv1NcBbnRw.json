    "text": "UPDATE!!   Returning after 4 months, and I am very pleased to inform all my fellow Yelpers that my original review stays True on all subjects.   The Wagyu Beef (any item) is out of this world! Both the seared and the skewers! Cooked to perfection; basically melts in your mouth   Sashimi is sliced spectacularly. Everything about the sashimi- temperature, thickness, texture, and flavor- made me want to just keep ordering more! Despite the fact that an order is only one piece, but it's well worth it for the quality that you get for it.   Just to note again, the vibe here is a great place to bring your friends and chill/enjoy quality food and 2 for 1 SAKE DEAL AND A SHOT BAR!   ORIGINAL REVIEW:   Very unique and colorful plating; overall very pleasant experience.   Ambience: Good vibes, tranquil music in the background, minimal unnecessary noise from staff/kitchen. (5/5)  Food: lightly portioned; however due to the reasonable pricing, it allows you to eat more/try different items WITHOUT getting bloated. Quality of the food is excellent, but if you want buffet size portions, you might want to reconsider. If you want to actually taste the food and enjoy what you are consuming, this spot is ideal for just that. (5/5)   Price: Affordable; considering that it is located on The Strip and it is Japanese Cuisine, it is considered quite reasonable. (5/5)   Service: Spectacular! All servers are very pleasant and are constantly walking around to see if assistance is needed. They are all very friendly :) the best aspect of their service is that they always check for finished plates and clear your table; which is a big one up because no body likes to eat on a crowded table. (5/5)   Overall: Definitely would return and would recommend as a great spot to chill and munch that is affordable and convenient since it's on The Strip.",

However the service and food were both disappointment. The service was so inattentive: first we waited for more than 10 min to even get water; no one came to ask for our orders even though we sat right across from the register and the waitresses/waiters came by us several times; we had to wave several times and eventually ask \"loudly\" to get someone to come over; then later I had to ask twice several minutes apart to get a fork; then my udon didn't even come when my husband almost finished his bibimbap dish; finally they never gave us changes for our payment (luckily we had some changes so we could cover the rest of the tips but what if we didn't have the exact changes with us?) About the food: The beef skewer was undercooked and hard to chew. The udon was nothing special and on the salty side. The only good thing is my daughter finished her Japanese potstickers so that should be decent enough. We would not recommend this place and would not come back.",

I wanted to just eat in my hotel room and due to confusing line, I asked the waitress inside if they take to go orders and if they do, where I can place an order. She said they take to go orders and told me to go back to the hostess desk. I waited in line again for more than 10 minutes only to be told that they are not taking to go orders \"per her manager\". I informed her that the waitress inside told me I can and was told \"my manager said no\". I wasted my time because the waitress inside doesn't know any better which is extremely frustrating. I get that you need to make necessary decisions based on business demand but make sure you communicate well amongst your staff so customers are not given wrong info. I was honestly looking forward to trying the food because I have only heard great things but I am not sure if I will every try this place after this interaction.",

    "text": "My friends and I decided to go to this restaurant based on the many positive reviews, the decent price point, and its vicinity to our hotel. But the minute we arrived, we all felt concerns about eating raw fish from a place that seemed a little...off. But, we figured it was in a big hotel on the strip -- so maybe it wouldn't be the best sushi of our lives, but it would be acceptable. How wrong we were! I became violently ill within hours of ordering the 7-piece nigiri + hana roll. My suspicions tell me that a questionable piece of mackerel is what likely gave me the severe food poisoning. I had to cancel my plans on Saturday night, instead having to hang out by my hotel room's toilet all night, feeling more sick than I have in years. It's the next afternoon, and I still can't seem to keep anything in. I reported the issue to the restaurant, and they seemed concerned but ultimately didn't do anything for me, and didn't even refund me for the horrific experience. My three friends who ate with me escaped without getting sick -- but my experience has been so terrible that I wanted to warn other potential customers.",

The extensive menu offers a wide variety of fancy and simple rolls, perfect for any sushi lover! E = Excellent Korean dishes! my husband chose to nosh on a few different kabob's to introduce me to the flavors of Korea! K = Killer staff. We had a tough time navigating the menu, but the hostess was so sweet, friendly and gave us great suggestions to accompany our meal.  U = Unbelievable vibes/atmosphere! Although we got our food to go, the space exudes a cool/trendy/environment that feels as though you've stepped into a little shop in Korea or Japan! S = Seaweed salad! OM NOM NOM! Literally full of flavor and so delicious! The hostess talked me into adding this menu item to my cart, and so glad she did! SO GOOD! H = Hidden in a corner of the Paris hotel, it's quaint and small, and yet, you can't miss it!  I - Incredible prices! After ordering sushi, seaweed salad, 4 different kinds of kabob's, sushitio peppers, eggrolls and more - our total was a mere $50!   I find myself craving this place since leaving Vegas and will make a point to stop back in! MMMM!",

We also only received one menu to share (2of us), and no happy hour menu. We had to ask for one later. After we ordered food no one came to check on us once, and they didn't refill our empty drinks. We had to ask a busboy to find a waiter later to give us a refill. The noodles I ordered were alright. I ordered the spicy tonkatsu. It was not spicy to me and lacked flavor. The California roll was all right and the sashimi sizes were very variant. The California roll was mediocre as well. For these high prices, mediuflld, and poor service, we will not return. One of the biggest pluses for this spot was the good old school hip hop music playing however.",

This place is located inside of the Paris Hotel and Casino. That should have been my first clue. It's literally located on the side of this wanna be alley way mimicking Paris streets. Huh....  The inside was not appealing at all. Very tiny. Small little booths with a center sushi bar. The walls were covered in some weird graffiti type of art. The vibe here is not a sexy one. Very casual and unromantic.   Service was pretty good. Food came out fast. Very attentive.  As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:  Edamame - Way too salty!  Seaweed salad - tiny portion....  Sliders - Not bad...needed to add ketchup because it was very bland.   Steak in a Bao bun - This was delicious!! Pretty much Bulgogi Beef in a Bao bun. Soooo good!!  Yellowtail Taco - Way too much Spicy Mayo!!   6 different speciality sushi rolls - All of them were pretty good. But very tiny rolls, and each cost around $25 a roll. Way too expensive for what you got.  Creamy Udon Seafood Soup - This was really good. Tasted like mac and cheese.   Overall - this place was way too expensive for lack luster ambiance and small portioned food. There are way better places out there.",

We ordered the King Cali Roll, Aria O, and the Kimono and they were perrrfect for our late night cravings! The ambiance was relaxing inside. It was around 11pm and there were lots of tables open. Their specials were awesome, too. Two-for-one House Sake and Oyster specials were enough to make us say yasssss! They're located directly across a cute shop called Le Journal, so it's nice that the foot traffic isn't too busy either. Highly recommend this place if you're searching for awesome sushi in the area!",

We were sat down immediately by the sushi bar and it wasn't too packed. We were given a \"Late Night Menu\" that was only available from 10pm-1am The prices for the sushi were around $18-25.   For starters we had the Kumamoto Oysters ($4 Each) which were already prepared for us and they were so good! We ended up ordering more. Now for sushi, I decided to try the Hot Spring Roll ($18) which had the baked scallop, crab meat, cream cheese, masago, and spicy mayo. It was a good sushi roll but I didn't think it was excellent.  At the bar you're able to see the sushi being made right in front of you with fresh ingredients. We were talking to one of the chefs and he was really nice and had us try different types of sauces. Now don't forget to check into yelp to get a free cheesecake or devil's pie. They didn't have any of those available so they offered me a Mochi which was nice. So I got the mango mochi and it was good!",

Two weeks ago, as we were walking from the casino side; we decided to stop by for lunch.  All we saw was the bar and sat down.  I found it weird that we sat there for 10 minutes and the two guys behind the bar kept looking at us but wouldn't talk.  I wasn't sure if they speak English so decided to go look for a waitress.  As I got up, a lady approached me to tell me that unless I see a hostess, no one will be helping me.  Mind you, you can't see a hostess when you're coming from the casino floor.  I told her that I never saw a hostess, she told me 'good luck getting service'.  Really?  The restaurant was empty and this is how you treat a person?  I was so irritated that I came back after I ate elsewhere to speak to the manager.  The same girl says that the manager isn't in and that I have no reason to complain.  This was so rude!  I took a business card to call in the complaint.  Called couple of times and got hung up on when I asked for the manager.  I didn't raise my voice or tell them that it was regarding a complaint.      This was such a terrible customer service spot that I wouldn't waste my money here.  If a manager reads this review, you have to manage your staff better.  Your staff is rude!!!",

And when something is not available, you further expect to be told when presented with the menus before you make your selections. This is largely why I can never, ever recommend this place.  Our neighboring table had the same problem and simply left.  Good decision!!  You also expect your server to get your order right, especially when any confusion stemmed from them not having things on the menu. So would I eat there again based on the food they actually did have?  No.  And you probably shouldn't either.  Salty miso soup; Greasy and tasteless \"egg rolls\".  The main courses our party ordered included tempura shrimp, Korean beef bulgogi and pork katsu.  All were all well below average except for the price which was well above.  They also feature sushi, which we didn't order or try, or try to order!  Face it, Las Vegas is full of food options.  This place in the Paris Casino is not one of them.",

Also had the edemame and Green Tea cheesecake. I would recommend this place and the staff was great especially the host and my server, Tien.

We chose this restaurant based on yelp reviews and were not disappointed!  We ordered a sashimi sampler and 4 rolls in total. When you first sit down they bring you steamed and lightly salted edamame. Once my husband showed me how to eat it, I fell in love! We got the combo first. Each piece of fish was better than the next and all melts in your mouth!  When our rolls came we realized that our eyes were bigger than our stomachs!  But, it was so amazing we ate it all!  Everything was very fresh!    The coup de Gras was the cheesecake. We told them we were posting a review on Yelp and they brought us the best tasting cheesecake I've ever had. It was creamy and not overly sweet and absolutely perfect.   Overall, the food is amazing, the prices are competitive and the decor is fun and lively.   If you are looking for amazing sushi in a really cool little Japanese pop culture inspired atmosphere, this is the place for you. You will not be disappointed!",

Watching the two communicate and work together to perfect each dish was like watching two angels guide me to food heaven. I wouldn't be surprised if Nikko and Dorien could walk on water. I'm deeply considering moving to Las Vegas because of them. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to visit Sekushi and you'd be a fool if you don't ask for Nikko and Dorien.

    "text": "It was definitely a surprise to see this while walking around the Paris Hotel and Casino. While strolling around the hotel, I came across Sekushi while looking for restroom. Checked on yelp to see what the rating was. It was on-par, if I could do half stars, I feel like this would be 3.5 stars. Way better than what I was expecting!   I was lucky that I went in between major mealtimes, and I was seated immediately.  There was free edamaeI ordered the Gyoza and Diced Teriyaki Chicken [Rice] Skillet, with a fried egg on top, from the Japanese Grill menu. The gyoza was good, I just felt like I wanted more from it.  The teriyaki sauce wasn't too sweet and the chicken was cooked well. Most placed with hot skillets, with rice or noodles, tend to over-cook the protein to compensate for the heat from the skillet.  The restaurant itself is toward the back past the casino. The restaurant shares in dining area with the ramen restaurant next door and has a little sushi bar in the middle of the floor. Seemingly one of the harder restaurants to miss while walking around. The walkway shows a neon lighted sign for Sekushi, which provided a modern feel to the restaurant. There wasn't a lot of seating, but there was enough to handle wandering hotel guests. The server who was waiting on me was kind and checked on me a few times during the meal.   Definitely recommend if you're stating at the hotel or just wandering around the Paris hotel.",

I had the pork dumplings, the California hand roll, the shrimp tempura roll, the wagyu sushi, and my friend had the pork dumplings with me, she also ordered her own shrimp tempura roll and she ordered another roll for herself. It was cool that the edamame was complimentary so that was a good starter. I think the customer service could've been a lot better, we waited a while before we were asked what we wanted to eat. Also, the rolls were amazing but one thing that stood out was the wagyu sushi, as good and tasty as it was, I don't think it's worth the price for just one piece. The bill at the end was not as bad as we thought because we did order a bunch of things.",

We tried wagyu beef with green tea salt, miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, chirashi, teriyaki chicken with rice and noodle. The only thing that was decent is the wagyu beef, but even that is heavily salted.   Chirashi is of course not salted, if it is then I would have probably flipped. But the sashimi was warm, and were sliced into such huge pieces, I had to pick between eating the sashimi first or rice first.  I would much appreciate it if they would slice them into 3 smaller slices. That way you would be able to eat a slice of sashimi with rice in every bite.",

We had an early dinner here and were seated at the sushi bar. You receive complimentary edamame with your meal. They have a large variety of sushi as well as small and large plates. We both ordered bento boxes, salmon for me and bulgogi for my boyfriend. He also ordered kirin draft beer and said it was good. The bento boxes include your choice of meat (they also have teriyaki chicken and panko shrimp), salad with peanut dressing, a chicken egg roll, and white rice. You also receive miso soup as an appetizer. The soup was really good but the SALMON was the star. It was perfectly crispy on the outside with the skin on and the salmon itself was so fresh! It reminded me of what my mom makes for me at home. I sampled my boyfriend's bulgogi and it was also yummy. We also ordered pork gyoza and those were good as well. The egg roll and salad were just okay. For dessert we shared the mango and red bean mochi and they were a sweet and refreshing ending to our meal. In short, the food and service were very good! I'm a fan!",

They cleared dishes quickly (for the most part) but some items took a very long time to arrive. -A couple of the oysters were a little weird...they were fresh, but a few of them had some inedible portions (that were not pieces of shell). -Chirashi was mostly rice and very little fish; not the ratio that one expects for the price. -Again - the quality of the fish was fresh, but nothing about the food screamed extraordinary.

This is a cute little sushi bar located across from the guests' elevators in Paris Hotel.   The wagyu skewer was my favorite thing on the menu, the meat melted in your mouth.  We ended placing another order of it because it was so delicious. Some of my other favorites were the Kumamoto oysters and the NegiToro roll, the latter was super soft and absolutely delicious.   On the downside, the grilled butter scallops was overcooked and a bit tough. The sashimi sampler was average, the presentation was beautiful, but the fish themselves were hit or miss, i.e. loved the mackerel but disliked the snapper.   Overall, a great option to have a casual sushi dinner, service was attentive (our waitress was Yui) and efficient.",

For the main course I ordered the vegetarian noodles, and they were okay. Probably not something I would order again. However my partner ordered the ginger chicken and I ate half of his plate. That is definitely something you would want to order if you're there.  Service was good and timely, and I would definitely eat there again the next time I stay at the Paris.

So, when I see from the front door, I think this is just ok place. Once we get sit it around 4 of us, Novi was our server that time, I saw her name tag. And also she was greeting us with welcome and warm smile. She show us the menu both I think have so many pages, or with 3 pages sushi menu and the other big with picture, explain each detail, and also bring out one of the daily special menu to our table.   Wow, she's excellent , great, friendly, patient, lovely, her service was fast, her speed is so fast, she knew what we need, keep on eye. Ask us if our dining food was ok or not? She pay attention in every single detail, we love it.. she work hard , nicest server ever in whole strip I think.. I mean sincere not fake coz we know server job base on tips. Looks like they all share same tips, but none of other server was care about our table.   Overall, we so happy.. she deserve much better high end restaurant in big 5 stars hotel with her attitude , professionalism. I hope this company treat her well and give her what she deserve. Will come back again if we coming back to vegas. Great . Very satisfied.",

We ordered the salmon skin, shrimp panko, and the spicy tuna rolls. All were good and on par with most sushi that we eat. The star of the show was the creamy seafood udon. Amazing! I could not stop eating this. It's made with shrimp, scallops, mussels, crab meat, fish cake, mushrooms, and vegetables. This is a must try at Sekushi. I need another bowl of it.",

We came here on our last night in town for something convenient to our hotel before heading to the airport. Check in on Yelp got us a free house sake which was a nice touch.   My boyfriend ordered the Sekushi 7 dinner that came with a special chef's choice roll. The platter had shrimp, tuna, salmon, yellowtail, squid, mackerel, and fatty tuna. The chef's roll was a simple roll with mixed fish (I watched them cut up fresh tuna, salmon, and a white fish (?) and dump into a container to make these rolls), avocado, and cucumber. He liked everything on the platter and thought it was all very fresh.   I was in the mood to try a few different menu items, so I ordered an oyster shooter, butter scallop skewer, yellowtail taco, and the Aria O roll. I was a big fan of everything, especially the roll - I had hoped to taste the mango more, but the salmon on top was so melt in your mouth I wanted more. The a la carte sushi is overpriced here per piece in my opinion, so it was more worthwhile for me to just get another roll. I got a roll that was super salmon focused, both inside and out (I can't remember the name, but it isn't on their website). This was the only thing I wasn't as big of a fan of; it wasn't worth the extra money spent as it somehow it didn't let the salmon shine as much as the Aria O roll despite having MORE salmon in the roll.",

We stopped by Sekushi in the Paris Las Vegas Hotel, and ordered a few things: Tofu Bibimbap, Vegetable Ramen, and a Miso Glazed Sea Bass Skewer. The food was incredible! The sea bass was so tasty that it left us wanting more! The bibimbap had an array of vegetarian delights; crispy tofu, kimchi, corn, broccoli, asparagus, and rice. The vegetables were very well-seasoned, especially the asparagus which was really delicious! Last, but not least, the ramen did not disappoint! I have been craving ramen for a while, and this one was packed with shiitake mushrooms and noodles! I have to say that I was a little apprehensive trying this place because of some of the Yelp reviews. Our dining experience proves that everyone has differing opinions, or that sometimes establishments use constructive criticism to improve their food and service. I don't know which prevailed in this case, but I hope this encourages someone to try this restaurant and others despite negative reviews! Maybe you haven't heard the best things about it, but if you're still curious enough to experience it for yourself--go for it!!!",

The restaurant was fairly busy, but we were able to get seated fairly quickly at the bar in front of Chef Min. I did my normal inspection of the case and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fish (I worked as a Sushi Chef for 9 years).  My wife and daughter ordered the Ramen from next door and the broth was an amazing, well balanced beef flavor explosion with some some equally delicious char siu (bbq pork).  No grilling or torching of the meat needed (horrible techniques for thin meat).  Back to my meal...   I started with a few of some great, meaty half shell oysters, followed by some sweet kumamotos... I was hooked, and from there, I asked Min for an Omakase, and let him work his magic.   Seared A5 wagyu - no teeth needed Seared Foie Gras with Russian Caviar and 24k gold flakes - sure, why not. Chu-Toro with freshly grated wasabi and I'm calling it a day.  Chef Min definitely earned my respect and I'll be seeing him soon in the future.",

Time and Time again, they always fail to surpass my favorite. But tonight they got themselves some competition in Las Vegas.  When it comes to sushi in Vegas, you're paying 3-5x what you'd pay back home. So it better be worth it.. here at Sekushi, the prices are reasonable for Vegas, AND the food is wonderful.  The chefs work very fast behind the sushi bar, and spare no time for mistakes. It's obvious they love what they do, and they're very good at it.    I ordered the Alaskan salmon roll, Japanese gyoza, Baked mussels, and panko shrimp.  The roll was out in about 5 minutes, when the place was pretty busy. Very impressive! It had wonderful flavor, and the balance of all the ingredients was wonderful.. letting each thing shine through.  The baked mussels were cooked perfectly, and the sauce with them was great. Warning though; if you're a baby like me when it comes to spice.. maybe ask them to hold the spicy aioli.   Japanese gyoza was super hot, fresh off the fire.  And filled with delectable flavor.    I would come here again!",

    "text": "I was not impressed by any of the dishes, especially given the steep price here for fast-casual Japanese food.  We only stopped at Sekushi for the convenient location in Paris, and the artfully decorated, modern space captured our eyes. Sekushi offers two menus featuring a raw sushi bar and cooked Japanese food, like skewers. We ordered:  Aria-O Roll: very average roll with salmon and shrimp with a pop of texture from masago arare and a pop of flavor from a honey truffle aioli; didn't hate it and didn't love it Wagyu Beef Skewers: best of the bunch; warm and tender beef that's well-seasoned with a sprinkle of green tea salt (didn't taste the green tea) Shrimp Skewers: pretty raw for a cooked skewer and had a bad charred taste Sea Bass Skewers: pretty good / a little sweet from the miso glaze Spicy Pork Kimchi Skillet: the skillet was sizzling hot but why was the food lukewarm? The meat was tough in consistency and the kimchi tasted pretty meh. Hard pass Chirashi Don: just pretty awful. The bowl consisted of 6 pieces of sashimi over rice, and each piece of fish tasted (and looked) less appealing that the prior - lacked any flavor and freshness. Another hard pass Negitoro Roll: overwhelming rice to fish proportion; not worth it  I'd say we tried a good portion of the menu in terms of variety, chosen with the help of our waitress (great service btw). None of the dishes felt standout. Will not be returning as there's too many better Japanese places on the Strip!",

The wagyu and pork belly skewers are probably the worst tasting pieces of meat I have ever consumed. My girlfriend and I both spit out our \"pork belly.\" It tasted more like shoe leather and should not be called pork belly because pork belly is incredibly tender and juicy. The salmon nigiri was amazing. The rolls were over-priced and unremarkable. $24.00 for a small, mediocre roll is agregious.  There are several better sushi locations on the strip.",

The menu featured your typically Japanese fare mixed in with Egg Rolls (Chinese), Bugolli (Korean), and Sushi rolls which are more Asian Fusion than traditional Japanese food.  i.e. if you go to Japan you would typically get a nigiri sushi but not likely a deep fired roll with sauce smothering it.  The Miso soup was pretty authentic.  My son and I ordered a bento each as well as a few side dishes.  The salmon was fresh and tasty.  The chicken teriyaki was great according to my son.  Free sake if you check in.  Would consider coming back the next time in Vegas and craving Japanese food.",

The nigiri sushi is only one piece so I felt disappointed when I got it as I am used to getting two pieces at other restaurants. The manager was very accommodating.",

The food was delicious- yes even the sushi which I was a little skeptical about since its raw fish and Vegas is a desert. \"It can't be that fresh right?\" But I was pleasantly surprised and decided to try it after speaking to the Hostess Jada as she raved about it. She was incredibly friendly and helpful and seated me right away after walking me through the menu. If you are on the strip and have time to pop into Paris, I would recommend coming to Sekushi for a meal.",

We said we'd wait for the bar seating and they said they had a table open for us if we wanted to sit right away. So sweet. We waited for about 20 minutes then we were promptly seated but during those 20 minutes the waiter, waitress and the hostess asked if we still wanted the table. Again, so sweet of them for checking in on us and seeing if we changed our minds.   We ordered the Waygu beef tataki and boy was it flavorful. I liked having the lava salt on it. The Creamy seafood udon was extra creamy. Reminded me of seafood pasta in Alfredo sauce. The Aria O roll was delicious. I love the crunch on the outside of the roll. My boyfriend ordered the chef's choice sushi and the fresh wasabi. It was a generous portion for an extra $3.   Note: if you check in you'll receive a free desert. We were so full so they kindly packed it to go.",

After a fun night at the tables, I was told the sushi bar close at 3:00am, boy were they wrong. I arrived around 12:52, and a party just was just seated. Miss Garcia worked with me to ask the chefs if they could do one more order; but as they agreed, she was overridden by the manager. So I was not able to enjoy what looked like a wonderful menu. Since I was not able to eat I'm not sure how the food actually is, but Miss Garcia is the cream of the crop when it comes to customer service and taking care of the customer... Hats off to her and her pride in her work!",

The flavor profile was very unique and combined with very fresh tuna that melts in your mouth made this our favorite roll of the lunch! We would come back just for this. . The kimono roll was a very close second, as the combo of he spicy tuna and nice crunch added to a change in pace of texture from the sekushi roll that led for a debate of which was our favorite.  Again, the cuts of fish were very fresh. . We tried two pieces of the Otoro, $15 each, but worth it with all its melt in your mouth goodness. . Service was great.  Very friendly, prompt and courteous.  Thank you Weethara for a very pleasant lunch experience.  We will definitely come back to try some more rolls!",

Unfortunately, since it was already late and I didn't want my daughter to ruin everyone's meal, I opted to just stay in my room.  My aunties felt bad because they said that the sashimi was really good and they wanted to get me something so I asked for the sashimi salad.  My auntie brought my order to my room around 10:15 PM & I ate the whole thing in less than 2 minutes.  Maybe it was due to the small portions, but also the fact that the fish was super fresh and their salad dressing was so good made me want to go downstairs for another order.  If I ever decide to stay on The Strip, I'll be sure to stay at Paris since my aunties's room was much nicer than my room at Bally's--just so I can come back here for their sashimi salad.",

But the salmon and yellowtail in particular were my favorite.   Service was fast and efficient. Our sashimi and rolls came out like 15 minutes later. It's very convenient as a to-go or quick stop kind of place. The restaurant is quite small. Not really meant for romantic dates.",

Indeed, their happy hour specials (which I took advantage of) were some of the best options I could have had for a meal in this hotel at the time. I was able to have a reasonably decent meal, especially a filling one that was reasonably healthful. Service was a bit uneven -- I didn't get more tea very quickly or anything, but I did have a decent meal alone. It doesn't feel very authentically Japanese, but this is the Las Vegas Strip so what did I expect, really? It suited my purposes and that was enough for me.",

I'm a frequent sushi eater, their fish is EXTREMELY FRESH! I've been in Vegas the past 3 days, and I've come 3 times already! I'll be back again for sure!

The fish did not melt in my mouth, seemed kind of tough, and didn't seem too fresh. Prices weren't that great either. Sucks that this was our last dinner in Las Vegas. Regrets.",

I mean you have to pull the table out to get into the booth without having your ass knock over a drink on the table next to you.    The service is even worse.   With a tiny table the severs bring out your courses with no where to put the dishes. They just stand there and look at you, like you have to grab the plates from them and figure out how to fit everything on the table.  They run food without knowing what table ordered it.   Several times a runner brought a dish to our area and just yelled out its name...\"spicy tuna roll\" ...3 of the 6 tables that ordered it now have to figure out who gets it.    What is it with Asians and horrible serving/customer service?",

The food came out before the drinks and I had to remind the waitress about the beer. I ordered the six piece sashimi which came with yellowtail, tuna and salmon, typical but fresh and delicious! I ordered one piece of $15.00 Otoro sushi which was delicious and fatty. I also ordered the Wagyu beef skewers tapas style which was delicious as well. I recommend this place for convenience.",

Nigiri sushi is priced by the piece ($5-$8 depending on the fish), instead of by the pair as in normal sushi establishments, and as a result you end up paying 2x for your nigiri. Rolls are $15+, and are \"slimmer\" than normal.  Fish quality is as one would expect in LV:  not straight from Tsukiji in Tokyo, but not spoiled either.  Service is friendly and efficient for the most part.  Although the waitress did forget to put in the order for one of our rolls, she remedied the situation quickly.  One drawback is there is only a limited selection of premium sakes and a few types of beer.  Locals would surely know of better sushi destinations in LV, but for visitors with a sushi craving Sekushi fits the bill.",

Im not sure how they got two dollar signs on yelp because one piece of uni was $8 before taxes... where in most places its usually about $6-$8 for two pieces. I went ahead and ordered it anyway because I love uni but as soon as I tasted it, it wasn't as good as the other places I normally go to.. you'd think for the price it would at least be comparable but it was far from it... and I dont remember seeing on the menu where they source their uni. I also ordered the Aria O - which was recommended by our original server, it's one of their more popular rolls... unfortunately, after almost waiting for two hours, it never came. The manager and our main server were very nice and kept on apologizing about the mishap - where half of our orders never came out even after almost two hours of waiting.  Me and my friends were hungry, upset and to add insult to injury - one of their male servers that handed us the tuna tartare gave us attitude. Im not sure if he was having a bad day or maybe he thought we were just a bunch of complainers but he should've seen/ known that his manager is already trying to do service recovery and he just made the whole experience from bad to worse after almost slamming that bowl of tuna tartare on our table and giving us so much attitude - we were a group of 6 girls and everyone saw and felt the attitude he gave us.  The manager ended up not charging us for the food that 3 of my friends got and offered to take care of us if we came back but most of us were traumatized with the experience and just opted out.",

We saw this sushi place and decided to try it out. We were greeted right away and shown to our table. It looked busy but was suprised on how fast we were seated.   When we sat at our table, we had gotten our drinks right away. Our server then greeted us. Her name was CHIKA and she was really professional about her job. Greeted us and asked if we had any questions. She helped us on explaining the menu. Even though it was busy, she took time to make sure we had our questions answered. She explained the different types of sushi and her recommendation. We decided to order the avocado with salmon and cream cheese. IT WAS AMAZING. The flavors all complimented each other without over powering the taste of the sushi. We then orderd the  Cheese cake with green tea sauce, which was to die for.   While eating, our amazing and attractive waitress Chika made sure we had everything we ordered and was taken care of. If I was single, I would have asked her for her number. But I hope my girlfriend doesn't find this posting or I will have to go back and eat sushi while getting her number   Anyways, best service great tasting food. Will recommend others to try this place. Make sure you ask for Chika.",

    "text": "This was my least favorite Japanese restaurant ever. My husband is half Japanese and we live in Orange County and visit Diamond Bar often so we have a very good selection of Asian restaurants nearby.  We were seated quickly, the restaurant was not busy, but once we were seated a few groups walked in after us, and the server went to these groups first before checking with us. They don't seem to be assigned to tables so we were forgotten for several minutes, and about a minute away from walking out before the server came by.  We ordered a bento each and the tempura green beans. She brought us our waters and some Edamame a few minutes later, then the fun started.  I watched the tables adjacent to where we were sitting be brought dishes and the runner ask both tables if they ordered the thing he was holding. This didn't just happen once, it happened 4 times.   My bento was brought out before the starter, then after several minutes where we were sure they had forgotten we'd order it the starter showed up, and then a few more minutes for my husband's bento to be delivered to the wrong table before finding its way to him. By this point, my salmon was cold. The Miso soup that comes with the bento was served when my husband's bento arrived because they had to make it, and that was probably the best thing we were served. He also didn't receive his roll when the bento was delivered, that came another several minutes later.  The rolls included were very small, I'd assumed they were half but these were tiny compared to a normal piece from a roll, and the entire place is over priced. Don't order the green beans, they were very soft and needed at least a little salt. At $19 per bento, and considering they charge $20 and up per roll, this place could not be more overpriced for mediocre food and service.   Some of these issues I could understand if the restaurant has been busy when we came in, but it was not. To the point where several of the workers were standing by the bar while we were waiting for any one of them to just bring us water.  I don't think I've ever been to a place that was this bad at just getting the food to the right table. Don't come here, there are better places eat inside Paris.",

We made reservations on open table, came on Friday at lunch.  The menu is pretty broad, as it seems to share the restaurant with the ramen restaurant next door?  We got  Salmon Skin Maki - the rice was really mushy here, and the rolls were cut very thin.  It's clearly a 6 piece maki forcefully cut into 8 pieces.  Wasn't impressed with this one. $9.00  Aria Premium Roll - This roll was better with texture.  The little rice puffs on the outside of the roll gave it a nice crunch.  The jalapeno gave it a nice kick, and saucy enough for a single bite.   $19.00  Sashimi 12 pieces - The presentation for this was quite nice.  We got 6 different types of fish (2 pieces each).  The chef brought it over, and nobody explained what type of fish we got.  Just put it down and walked away.  So I'm just going to guess.  Salmon, Hamachi, Bluefin Tuna, Halibut, Some scaley white fish, Mackeral.  The cuts of fish were really thick and a great size, no complains there.  But the type of fish offered were not unique.   $39.00  Salmon Collar - This came fried and not grilled, which is weird, since they serve skewers??  The size of the salmon collar was pretty big.  It didn't come with any sauce like other Japanese restaurants would offer.  Just a fried salmon and a slice of lemon.  We asked for ponzu sauce, and they happily gave it, but this should come without someone asking.  It was meaty, and although it was fried and didn't have the smokey flavor, it wasn't too bad for the price  $5.00  Negihama Hand Roll - The handrolls came with a lot of filling and not too much rice, the nori is nice and crispy! MUCH better than their maki rolls!  $7.00  Negitoro Hand Roll - Buttery fatty tuna in a handroll with crispy nori.  This one was probably the best of all the dishes, although a little pricey for just a handroll, but you're eating in a hotel, I guess it sorta justifies $10.00  Total came out to about $60.00/person for lunch, it was pretty steep considering I didn't have anything special. They do give you a bowl of edamame on the house when you first sit down They also take total reward credits.  One of the reasons why I came, but didn't really feel like I ate anything special.  Maybe I need to sit at the bar and have the sushi chef make me something special.  The service was okay, always topping our water cups.    2.5 stars rounded up to 3.",

Although we did order other things at our table, only the creamy seafood udon stood out. 5 stars for the creamy udon, and 3 stars for everything else we ordered.   Make sure you get the creamy seafood udon, not the non creamy version. They really pile on the seafood and the soup is absolutely delicious. If you like clam chowder and udon noodles.. this is the dish for you! Unique and filling, I'd get this again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "I have been here three times over a few Las Vegas trips and keep forgetting to review! This restaurant is kind of split into two, and this review is for the left/sushi side. It's nestled in the Asian \"aisle\" of restaurants in the Paris hotel casino.   We've ordered lots of different sushi, and a few beers. We tend to always get a crunchy/spicy tuna type roll, salmon rolls, gyoza, edamame, and some tamago nigiri.  Their fish is always fresh, the rice is cooked properly, the rolls are substantial and (considering Vegas casino restaurant) affordable for what and where it is. You can pay a lot more for much lower quality food in Vegas so this place is a win for a satisfying (and fast) sit down meal that feels fresh and healthy. It really helps cut through the hangover and heaviness that Vegas vacations and buffets bring.   The service is great and attentive, and the rolls arrive fast. It's usually not crazy busy but my assumption is that the average American tourist doesn't gravitate to sushi, and we generally eat our meals on vacation in between peak hours to avoid lines.  Must try! And we'll be back for sure.",

Do you have questions?\" And I kept saying \"no I just need some time to look over the menu\" I've been to a lot of sushi spots before so I understand the menu. After getting asked 4 times in such a small time span I just choose the rainbow roll and a salmon lover (not sure if it's called that but it was salmon on top and inside) along with some sashimi.   The fish is very fresh, that's what I like about this place. And I enjoyed the salmon lover roll as well but the rainbow roll I was not able to even finish it! It was VERY DRY! The crab that they used for the inside of the roll made it not have a good taste, it was very plain.   Once they hand you your order they just leave you alone, no water refills no nothing. Once I got the check I saw that the premium rolls (the salmon and rainbow roll) were more than $20+ PER ROLL!! I wasn't even able to read the menu so great because I was rushed by the employees. The rolls are not THAT great, I've had better for a lot cheaper and having better service.",

The surf and turf roll, which was tasty since I love truffle salt on top of the roll. I enjoyed this roll, and never had one like it before. The meat was cooked nicely.   After those two items I was still hungry so I added the negitoro roll. This was about as bland as the tuna tartar. So I closed out this meal which came in at $60.

    "text": "Wasn't sure about this place at first. I have high expectations for sushi/Japanese restaurants and especially in Vegas, which is overly commercialize, I wasn't sure if this place was good.   Order the omakase sushi (18 different sashimi course meal) and to my surprise, the fish was excellent. Not fishy at all.   My job takes me to a lot of places where the sushi is \"fresh\" so really didn't think this would live up to other places I've been too. Granted you can't get a live caught fish, but the fish served here makes it seem like it was just caught.   The omakase is $90 which for some may seem high, but you get the  cuts and types of fish that would normally cost a lot more. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas and the Paris Casino.   Nikko, who prepared the dish prepared it with precision and upmost care. It looked amazing. Not sure if my picture does it justice since I took one picture and then just dug into the food.  Not only was the food great but the service was excellent as well. No I was a great server. Never needed to ask for anything. She was there and brought things before I even had to ask!   Check this place out!",

My family and I were pretty starving by then.  Aria O Roll ($19) - Mango inside was an interesting choice. I rarely eat sushi with sweet/fruity ingredients. The crunchy outer layer is definitely unique!  Chirashi Don ($22) - Yummy assortment of fish and fish eggs over rice. Too much rice, not enough fish!  (not creamy) Seafood Udon ($19) - My mom initially ordered the creamy seafood udon, but it turns out that the soup was super dense and cheesy. We sent it back asking for a seafood udon in a normal soup base (not on the menu), and they were super nice about.  Food is good but not amazing. And the price tag--yikes.",

Since we assumed this place mostly served sushi, we thought the sashimi salmon and rice picture shown would be what we get.  Nope.  The salmon is actually grilled and not the raw sashimi salmon and white rice bowl we thought we had ordered.  I think the menu is so confusing and should be redone to reflect what the entree really is.  For example, show the grilled salmon with the rice instead of picturing it raw.  The whole salmon entree was not very good.  Skip the clear broth Seafood Udon bowl also.  It is very bland.  The scallop skewer appetizer was so tiny, I could not even tell they were scallops.  The Chirashi bowl (small) was very underwhelming as well.  There were barely any sashimi pieces with a bunch of rice underneath.  Overall, all of the items were extremely overpriced for small portions of mediocre taste.  Our group walked out of there disappointed and still hungry.",

The rolls are a fair size, but pretty sure the jalapeno was just green pepper and it was big chunks with zero flavor or spice. The skewers were SUCH a waste! The scallop was 3 little halves; basically 1 1/4 of an actual scallop and nothing great. The wagyu beef was also quite lame. The bulgogi was barely cooked, super fatty and just not that great. It was sitting on top of a huge pile of shredded cabbage in some juice. Like when you don't fully cook the meat all the way through and it's still watery in the pan. I also didn't care for the ginger dressing on the salad which I normally love.    If you're looking to treat yourself on a nice dinner out in Vegas, go someplace else.",

Next we ate the Surf and Turf rolls ($26) with seared wagyu beef, panko shrimp, avocado, black lava salt and truffle oil. The beef was warm and so yummy!  We finished off our meal with the Kimono rolls ($19) with spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, crispy onion, and balsamic sesame. I enjoyed the crispness of the onion and panko shrimp inside the rolls.  All of these rolls were colorful, fresh, tasty and very easy to eat. The ratio of rice versus filling was perfect. The mix of different flavors and textures were amazing! These rolls looked as good as they tasted!  Overall, I found the rolls a bit pricey but I did recognize that these were high quality sushi rolls. They were refreshingly different! I definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Really great sushi place! Here's what we ordered and my comments:  Wakame Salad - probably the best I've ever had and I order it everywhere! Aria O roll - absolutely amazing. The masago is crunchy, the cilantro is amazing, the spice is just right! Oyster Shooter - probably the best I've ever had and I order it everywhere Spicy Garlic Edamame - this is seriously spicy!  (Too spicy for us) Surf N Turf roll - very, very good! Green Mussels - good, a little on the spicy side.  One constructive criticism...the servers should be mindful about reaching across in front of a patron...we had 3 different people reach across in front of us during our meal.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here to get our sushi fix for our Vegas trip and we were unfortunately extremely disappointed. We ourselves work at a pretty well known sushi place in LA and for a sushi restaurant in Vegas with such high pricing and mediocre sushi, we had high hopes.   To be honest, the good probably outweighs the bad, but for a place that sells sushi, it leaned more toward bad for me. I'll start with the bad and end with the good.  CONS: If you want SUSHI, and I mean NIGIRI, do NOT come here. It would be a waste of a penny. It costs $5+ for just ONE piece where at most other sushi places, they charge you that much for 2 pieces.  Sushi had no presentation what-so-ever. No toppings. No options for toppings. Halibut was extremely plain without lemon and salt or ponzu or something. I received a scallop that was falling apart halfway.  Half the waiters looked like they were just there without really knowing the menu or really offering service. They took your order once and bye. They won't even pick up your plates without you asking them too. Really poor at sushi bar. Out of 4 waiters, 1 was attentive enough. Sorry I don't remember the name.  PROS: If you want satisfying ROLLS, give this place a shot. Their signature rolls were up to par and decently priced for being based in Vegas. I tried the Sakura roll and it was saucy and tasty all over.  (We also tried to Negitoro Cut Roll and it was average.)  Come here for the small plates and the cooked food. Judging from the menu, this place really likes its Wagyu, so plenty of Wagyu items here. Not easy on the wallet though. - Gyoza - was tasty and tasted how gyoza should taste. You can probably skip it though. - Sirloin Steak Steamed Bun - DELICIOUS. No more words for this but that. - Wagyu Sliders - Good but not all that.  Complimentary edamame when you start. Not bad.  Overall, this place is worth a shot but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. I'd rather go to Katsuya or try another sushi place out. But if you're looking for some rolls or tapas, make your way here. Sushi? Nah.",

    "text": "For someone that doesn't eat sushi, I really liked this place.  I'm always looking for sushi places with good non-sushi items so that I look forward to going and my wife can enjoy sushi.  Sekushi's Chicken Teriyaki Bento was great and filling.  It came with steamed rice, ginger dressing salad, miso soup and spicy tuna roll (or panko shrimp roll) and chicken teriyaki (of course).  Portions were surprisingly large and was a filling meal (something I'm not used to at Japanese restaurants).  Ordered: Edamame (complementary) Chicken Teriyaki Bento (miso soup, steamed white rice, ginger dressing salad, spicy tuna roll and chicken teriyaki) Aria O Roll (salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, masago arare jalapeno, micro cilantro, honey truffle aioli)  Summary: I would recommend this place.  Just keep in mind that I'm not a sushi expert :)",

We order eight sushi roll items and our table was small they brought out all the sushi at once and of course no place to put them. We didn't have any soy sauce had to flag down the waiter to get us some. We had to wait about 5 minutes for our soy sauce way too long. We should have grab it off the other table. Not worth the money.",

I ordered yellow tail which is something I use as a benchmark for a sushi restaurant because the taste degrades really fast if it's not fresh... and they're yellow tail was very mediocre, Super fishy and bitter. Fresh yellow tail tastes like butter.  The rest of the food was good, but the fact that they charge double the price, for mediocre nigiri sushi really turned me off.  Their specialty roles were $20+ this place should be classified as \"$$$\", not \"$$\" with these prices, if that was the case and I wasn't caught off guard on a night I wasn't tying to drop a bill on dinner, I wouldn't be so upset.",

Loved the crunch on the outside of the rice  2) surf and turf roll - nice mix of seafood with wagyu beef pieces   Even on a Friday night we were able to get seats immediatly and all the food came out quickly and was fresh.   Service was quick and everything we needed was provided.   Will come back!",

Their staff is extremely friendly and sushi knowledgeable, the service is dead on, the sushi is as fresh as it comes, the presentation is to die for and the flavors will blow your mind!!!  Also, reasonably priced for it's remarkable quality. I've been to many \"fine\" sushi restaurants in Las Vegas that tripled the cost and didn't come anywhere close to this! So if you, like me, are a sushi fanatic and you find yourself in Vegas. Take a trip to Paris! LOL.",

We sat at the sushi bar after 2 pm and after a wave of conference attendees had left. The bar had five seated at the most including the two of us. Our drink order took over five minutes to be delivered and it didn't come with water. When we asked, the server came with one cup of water. I ordered a bento box, and they ended up bringing it separate from my wife's chirashi bowl, and giving it to the guy seated next to us. (He didn't realize it was not his until they delivered me his five minutes later with Bulgogi (I ordered Salmon).   Overall, the food was just okay. Quality is just as good as buffet sushi. So with the poor service, it's not worth returning.   (I don't know how it has 4.5 stars!)",

Yes, there can be improvements (miso soup was a tad bit salty, but mostly because they use a high quality miso or that the edamame was over blanched and lost vibrancy) but for Vegas, a city filled with profit-driven businesses, it's rare to find a business that is passion-centered, and certainly in my experience sekushi is a passion driven restaurant with quality sushi in a convenient location in the Paris hotel! Worth coming out to!  The foie gras sushi was foie-king great. The surf and turf was a textural delight, with different flavors noticeably exploding in a perfect linear sequence.  The nigiri was good. The Uni was Santa Barbara Uni of the highest quality. Perfectly shucked oysters with no sand, super fresh oceanic bursts of flavor, and topped with an umami-laced citrus ponzu.   Overall, stellar meal. Would love to dine again.",

Being that is is my wife's first time in Vegas, every detail of our three night stay was planned. After finding out there was a 45 minute wait at 9 pm on a Saturday night, we decided to \"settle\" for sushi. Staying at the Paris, you plan on eating French or Italian food, be thought we'd give it a try as we enjoy some good seafood from time to time.   The seating was immediate, the drinks came quick. We wanted a table, but instead were reluctantly offered a seat at the sushi bar. What an experience! Nikko was preparing meat in front of us. To say the knife skills we a form of artwork would be an understatement. The level of conviction he had for every dish he made was outstanding. As we began to eat, he very respectfully began engaging in conversation. By the end of the meal, it felt we were friends. He was extremely personable yet remained professional and timely on his artwork of making 5 star sushi.   I simply cannot wait to eat here again. Mostly because of the time we had sitting at the bar and meeting Nikko! Make sure to take care of him because I happened  to offer him a job in Oregon. He kindly thanked me for the offer but said he was happy with the 6 years of being on the team.   I've eaten great food all over the country, and it takes the right experience to make that food taste great. You will not regret going out of your way to eat at the Sekushi.",

None of them are standout in such a high price. those are the worse sushi i hv even saw in my life.....they are badly decorated,small and not fresh tasting.

He amazed me with his food presentation and everything I ate was amazingly good. The service was quick and beautifully done. I sat on the outside of the sushi bar which is close to the main walkway of Paris and as people were passing by they saw the plates that was being handed to me and many people were turned on to eating here because of it. I definitely recommend this place not only because of the great sushi chef but even the hostess and other workers were very accommodating and refilled our drinks before i could look and ask for one. The staff is very friendly. I'll be back here again for sure!!!!  PS. I had to add this last part because I like how the management took the time to respond and thank me for my comment. It shows that they really have great customer care and appreciate the feedback. Again great staff, place and food!",

We were seated at the sushi bar. It's a bit overpriced but what do you expect...it's at the middle of the Las Vegas strip.  I ordered the Japanese miso ramen ($18) and my friend ordered the Chirashi don ($22). We were given edamame to start off. The ramen broth was on the bland side and it didn't have that nice rich miso broth. I eat a lot of ramen in the Bay Area and had the best ramen in Japan, so you can say I'm a ramen snob. There were a few slices of chashu and half an egg, topped with bean sprouts and two pieces of seaweed. It was a decent size bowl size of ramen but the flavor just wasn't there.  The Chirashi don was a piece of art! There was a variety of raw fish on the bed of rice. The rice was a bit dry but the fish was fresh.   I also checked in on Yelp and I asked for the cheesecake. Unfortunately, they were out of the cheesecake but they had the green tea mochi. The mochi was filled with green tea ice cream and topped with some whipped cream. So remember to check in guys!",

We were wowed. Sushi from gas stations is bigger. 10+ dollars for the smallest rolls I have ever seen. The quality of the fish was hit and miss. I understand Vegas is expensive, but I went thinking I'd gladly pay 75+ dollars for amazing sushi. The reviews are from people that know not what good sushi tastes like. Never again.

    "text": "Sekushi is by far one of the absolute best Sushi restaurants I have eaten at. I am giving this wonderful place a 5 star rating for the reasons listed as follows.   1. Ambiance. When you walk into Sekushi, you know immediately that you are in a well managed establishment and will receive only the best treatment. You are welcomed in by all members of the Sekushi team, seated in an area that best suits your personal needs, and the atmosphere around you can only be described as aesthetic. The restaurant is well lit, and far from dull as it is decorated with everything from neon lights to retro Japanese movie posters and kawaii anime eyes. Overall, a very trendy dining experience for people of any age.   2. Staff. The people are enthusiastic about what they do here. Not only do they greet you, but they say farewell and thank you on your way out. They staff is quick to deliver the food as well as make it, yet the food and service do not seemed rushed in the slightest. Every server seems to be well polished in their profession as they are light on their toes, friendly, bubbly and well mannered. The bussers are quick to clean the place up as well as they are kind to offer cleaning up anything that may be of hindrance on your table. The chefs are skilled in their stations as well, always ensuring that the food is well prepared and that their station is always sanitary.   3. The food. Everything in this establishment is extremely well prepared, and let me just say that you get what you pay for. My first time ever eating uni I tried here. The color was just as it is supposed to be; a bright light orange. In comparison to the other restaurant I ate it at afterwards, I was astounded to discover that this other place had given me the worst tasting food I had ever eaten in my life. After eating at Sekushi I  have learned what good sushi is supposed to taste like. The fish is fresh and colorful, the food is far from bland, and is a symphony for the taste buds. Everything from the appetizers, to the entrees, rolls, deserts and alcoholic beverages are up to par,  delectable and full of flavor.   Oh, and one more thing, Nevada locals park for free inside the Paris parking garage, which is a huge added bonus. No worrying about rushing your food down to get that cheaper parking ticket. :)",

The portions are small and expensive for what you get but it's expected since it's Vegas but I wouldn't mind if he quality of the food we're good. This was not the case. They did have a good buy one get one free sake special. Maybe the other two sections were better but I didn't get a chance to try it.",

    "text": "First sushi restaurant I've been to in Vegas and was left wanting more. Without coming off as too pretentious here, both my fiance and I spent over a decade combined working in restaurants so we understand the workings of the service industry. We get that sometimes servers are overwhelmed or in the weeds with too many tables, etc... I felt that our server had plenty of time to talk with the fellow co-workers but never once checked on our table once the food was dropped off. This means that by the time she finally did come back and dropped the bill off we hadn't received two of the items we ordered. Unfortunately we never had time to communicate this with her prior to the bill arriving because she never stopped back. Of course once this was addressed they were then taken off our bill but no additional service recovery was taken. I'm not asking for hand outs, but if you forget not only 1 but 2 of the menu items a table has ordered you should probably make an effort to do something to prevent a review like this from happening. All of this being said, the fish was fantastic, albeit slightly overpriced but what isn't in Vegas. We were very pleased with our food but the service, or lack thereof, will drive people away from this place. The only thing saving this from being a 1 star review was the Uni sushi. Some of the best I've ever had and I'm a huge sucker for Uni",

Lobster roll was beautiful and tasted even better the sauce was DE-vine -- just the right amount of kick. Wish I took a pic but I ate it too quick!  If you're on the strip and craving Japanese give this place a try. Definitely will be back when I'm in Vegas again.  Thank you to Yuri who was attentive and sweet. Thanks for a great meal.",

They have a late night that is different from their regular menu starting at 10pm. I was too lazy to go elsewhere so we stayed.   Located in Paris Hotel we sat near the front entrance. It was pretty quiet at 11pm. I guess everyone is out and about clubbing while I'm just hungry. I wanted something not too greasy so I opt to order their Rainbow Roll called Sekushi Rainbow. In this roll it's actually real crab, came with alaskan crab, tuna, salmon, and yellowtail as the protein. I order fresh wasabi on the side. To my surprise it didn't look like fresh wasabi. As wasbi is a root and if grated it would look like garlic consistency more than what we got. Maybe they mix it with other stuff? It was different and good.   It's hard to say I'm a fan here as I only ate one dish. For $22 I think it's priced pretty high for a roll. I rather have imitation crab meat lol.   Need a place that opens until 1am that is not fast food? This might be it.",

I had to go to urgent care (and spend 4.5 hours and $200) to get an iv to due not being able to keep any water down. It has been absolute HELL. I am beyond disappointed in this establishment.

After we were seated, it took awhile for our server to come back to take our order.

Now this review is directed at the hostess and the 2 Asian girls working on the pan fried section of the restaurant. NOT the sushi part. They do however both fall under the Sekushi brand.  Any ways, I came down from my hotel room the other night and walked up to the hostess. She looked at me with a confused look as if she was wondering why I was standing in front of a restaurant.... I'm trying to eat, DUH???! Maybe she was judging me cuz I was alone idk.  She finally brought me to a seat and said the servers will be with me shortly. I kid you not, after sitting there for 10 minutes, not a single server came up to greet or offer me water. IT WAS LATE NIGHT AND THE RESTAURANT WAS NOT BUSY.   I saw the two Asian girl servers helping others and one of them disappeared after a while. The other one was busy counting some papers at the kitchen window (maybe her tips?) and basically I wasn't attended to.  After another 5 mins, I was fed up. I got up and told the hostess: nobody's helping me so I'm just going to leave. She did not make an attempt to stop me.  During that time, I did not know the sushi and pan fried section both fell under the same restaurant. I walked over to the sushi part and asked a server if I could just sit any where? She points at the same rude hostess in the front and said; ask her.   By then I was fed up and didn't bother giving this restaurant a single penny of my money. Disappointing service. I could care less if your food is beyond amazing... BAD service = BAD food.  I would highly recommend AVOIDING this restaurant. Go try YONG KANG ST next door- they are amazing and served me immediately. Y'all should change ur name to SH*TSUSHI.",

When your drink would get low, they were on top of making sure to refill it. Everyone worked well together to make sure customers were treated great!   The food...YUM! Let's see in total during both trips we ordered the following: Miso Soup: probably the best miso soup I've had! We ordered seconds on this. So fresh, delicious and perfect start to a perfect meal!   King Cali roll & shrimp roll: didn't love the Cali roll but the shrimp roll didn't stand a chance! FYI they are super tiny rolls, so use this as an appetizer.   Beef bulgogi bento box: very very good! Well cooked beef slices, with large amounts! Flavor on point! Bento box comes with soup, salad, chicken egg roll and rice. I enjoyed this way too much!   Salmon bento box: Salmon had great flavor and was cooked well. My mom loved it!   Ebi don bowl: this is a rice bowl, with an over easy (extremely easy) egg, onions and shoyu sauce with 2 fried shrimp. I came on a Friday and couldn't eat meat, so I got this. Looking at it, I was disgusted because of the runny egg, but I mixed it up and gave it a try...and glad I did because I loved it. Had a perfect sweet flavor because of the sauce, extremely good and worth it! Just wish it had more shrimp.   Gyoza: the sauce made these soooo amazing! I let them soak up the juice before eating them and I still crave the wonderful flavor!",

    "text": "OK, so I was in Sin City for a weekend R&R getaway and didn't want to load up on heavy buffet food. So I stopped in Sekushi at the Paris Hotel.   Short version: a very friendly and intimate Japanese restaurant with some of the best sushi I've ever eaten. However, have some patience with the kitchen - and a few of the dishes really need to be fixed because of their salt content, so be wary.   Long version: After winning a nice amount of money at the 21 table, I decided to splurge on my last afternoon in Las Vegas and enjoy some delicate Japanese food. So I parked myself at the sushi bar at Sekushi.  Sekushi reminds me of a \"Shokudo\"-style eatery: it's intimate, with about 10 tables or so, and a big sushi bar. Quite aesthetically pleasing to the eyes, it is located right off the elevators of the Paris Hotel.    Besides, I like the name of the place, even if John B. didn't in his review. Yeah, the name translates to \"Sexy\" - so what? It's catchy and fits in with the entire decadent concept of Las Vegas. If you have a problem with it, then it sounds like a personal issue to me. But I digress.   NOTE: If you check in on Yelp, you get a free flask of house sake, served either hot or cold according to your taste. That in itself was a big draw for me.   When you sit down, you are offered a complimentary bowl of edamame, or soybeans. They made a delicious and nutritious start to the lunch which was to come.   I decided to start out with sushi. I ordered a la carte-style servings of eel, octopus and shrimp. It came out in a reasonable amount of time (given the fact that the place was a bit packed), and the servings were nice and thick. Definitely A+ in my book! (Pic attached to show you the proof.)   Then I decided on a lunch bento box of chicken teriyaki. I had to wait a bit for it, which wasn't a big problem - I had loads of time until I had to leave. The staff was nice enough to tell me that it was on its way. Nice.   The bento box was HUGE - and I'm from Houston, where we specialize in big portions of food. Besides the entree and the rice, there were gyoza (fried dumplings), a salad and some tempura. WOW.   The breast of chicken teriyaki was succulent and rich, and the tempura was plentiful, delicate and tasty. So far, so good.   The salad, however, was a BIG disappointment. I don't know who made the salad dressing, but it tasted as if they dumped a cup of salt into it. I could only eat a few bites before I had to just give it up. YEEECH!!   The price was right for location and overhead - I paid about $30 for lunch, which was all of the above and two flasks of sake. Given the fact that you are in cost-conscious Las Vegas, it was definitely a better deal than the $30 prix-fixe lunch you would get at the hotel restaurant.   So - would I return? Definitely - if I had an hour or so to kill, because it is not a place where the food comes out quickly. However, I hope that the chef and the management look into the sodium content of some of these dishes, because this place just missed getting a Peter Hughes Five-Star Review. Sayonara!",

We were seated at the bar immediately. Tables and banquettes are also available.   The resto was loud due in part to the proximity to the hallway and due in part to the lack of decorum and good etiquette demonstrated by the table of boors behind us. It's Vegas, and we've all tippled a bit over the line and been a bit too boisterous in the result. This was not that; it was extended shouting and cackling. I was surprised that neither the hostess nor the servers asked them to reign it in a bit.  The sashimi salad is a bargain at $14. Many big pieces of sashimi and plenty of tasty greens. The spider roll was delicious; $16 isn't unreasonable, but it's not the deal that the salad is. Large beer is $8.  A great spontaneous pick on this last-minute vacation! Maybe that's the secret to choosing restos - if you've been planning the trip awhile then carefully select a destination meal. If you fly away on the spur of the moment then dine on a whim!",

It was basically lettuce, fish and 3 tomatoes that weren't very ripe. It could have just used some sesame seeds or even edamame or some crunch to spice it up. They do give you some edamame to start and those even needed some salt.

My water was refilled without me having to ask, and she came to check up on us multiple times.   The spicy tuna roll and cucumber avocado roll were fresh and delicious. The teriyaki salmon bento was so good. The salmon was soft and flaky with a crispy skin. I loved that it came with a side salad, rice, and an egg roll.

    "text": "If you're in the mood for some solid Japanese food but can't decide on what to eat, Sekushi is the perfect place for you. This place has everything from sushi and robata to bento and ramen, and everything is done surprisingly well.  I've read through some of the recent bad reviews of this pace and I think it comes down to one thing. Expectations. Sekushi is located in Paris Paris, next to the casino. Which basically means that it's not gonna be the most amazing sushi you've ever had, and it's gonna be a bit expensive.  What it does offer though, is a trendy little Japanese spot that delivers a variety of menu items, all executed pretty darn well. I wasn't blown away by the chirashi or any particular nigiri we ordered, but the fish quality was high and the cuts we're very satisfying. Even more satisfying was the fact that we could order a few sticks of yakitori as well as other small dishes, that were equally well prepared. The butter scallop skewers were as smokey and tender as any yakitori shop I've been to.  If you've been to an izakaya before, you know how hard it is to find a place that does everything well. Sekushi is like a trendy izakaya on steroids, because they have literally every Japanese dish you can imagine. Even some weird rice and noodle skillets that seem as authentic as that fake steak in their display.  Only in Vegas can you get a Japanese restaurant that caters to everyone and still does everything pretty well. I'd say that's worth paying a little extra for. If you want some great sushi, go to China Town. Come here if you just want to have a good time and enjoy some good eats.",

You can eat in one of the many restaurants locate on the strip, one of the many located off of the strip, or you can eat at a tiny restaurant located deep within the casinos and mini malls with some truly amazing food. We walked by Sekushi very early in the morning and thought it looked really good, so when lunch time came a little later we decided to head back over and give them a try. What caught my eye? The bulgogi beef with white rice and corn, it looked incredible in the picture and I was praying it would like equally as good when it was in front of me, and boy oh boy, IT DID! We were sitting at the little bar right in front of the grill so we we're able to basically watch them prepare our food and it truly looked amazing being made and when it was served to us. The meat was so flavourful and tender that it practically fell apart in my mouth, so good. The rice and corn was great as well and tasted very good mixed in with the juice from the bulgogi beef.   Overall, this little restaurant may of been the sleeper hit of my trip to Las Vegas. The food was amazing, the setting was wonderful, and the staff was friendly as well.

On average, we each probably spent around $25/person. The problem? After finishing our meals, almost none of us were actually full.  I had the chirashi bowl. The presentation was super cute and the sushi itself was good, but they only give you only one piece of each fish. At other places, I could get double the quantity and the same quality of fish for the same price or less. Proportionally, they also give way too much rice.  One of my friends did the skewer deal (I believe 5 for $25) and that was *especially* not filling for him.  We did appreciate the free house sake obtained via Yelp check-in -- they give a LOT per person. But unfortunately, it doesn't the negate the overall mediocre experience.

    "text": "I came here for a snack (quite an expensive snack) when I wasn't too hungry but wanted something delicious to eat. They serve Foie gras relatively plainly here similar to just a piece of nigri sushi.   I give it 3 stars for having Foie gras at all and for the beautiful plating. The actual Foie gras wasn't the best I've had in that it wasn't the most flavorful. As I'm writing this, I remember the flavor being relatively bland and unseasoned. While foie gras is definitely able to stand on its own, sans excessive accoutrement, I do think that an Asian or Asian inspired sauce would've improved both dishes which are otherwise overwhelmingly tasteless and fatty.   Essentially, I got a few pieces of high end tuna nigri with small pieces of Foie gras on top, and then a plain piece of Foie gras. These are not shareable sizes if you're a fan of Foie gras, though you'll wish you had someone to share the cost of such plain dishes. In my opinion, more of a salty miso based sauce would've been appropriate for both dishes (not just plain soy sauce). My favorite combination at another local sushi restaurant, Sushi Roku, is the seared Foie gras with truffle miso sauce.   Absolutely beautiful plating, poor seating/atmosphere, and poor service.",

I was craving just protein post gym and went with the 12 piece sashimi $39. For this price I expected good sashimi, not great, but good. I got fridge sashimi. Sashimi that was too cold and tasteless. I was very disappointed.  The only good thing about this was the soy sauce.  Krissy K. got the skewers plate (also going for protein alone) and she got to choose any 5 skewers for $25: -Wagyu Steak, Butter scallop, grilled shrimp, JFC chicken and Korean Kalbi. I only tried the JFC chicken and it was good with a nice crispy sweet outer layer. The rest were not good where she even had to dip the beef in my soy sauce for taste; you will have to read her review.",

    "text": "I think this restaurant is a worthwhile stop if you are in the mood for some late night sushi.  There are MANY sushi restaurants along the Las Vegas strip so it took my husband and I a while to figure out which one we wanted to go to before the rest of our busy night.  We knew we wanted to be safe and make reservations and that we wanted to be close to the show we were going to afterwards.  After comparing reviews and prices of the many sushi joints we finally decided Sekushi was the winner.  Big PRO: the price.  Majority of the other sushi restaurants on the strip are $$$ and not that much better with reviews.  We figured we could save a couple bucks by heading here instead of another place that probably has the same quality of fish.  I would recommend getting reservations if you are on a fixed schedule like we were because they do not have a ton of seating at this location in Paris.  Sekushi gives off a \"outdoor market/restaurant\" vibe with limited seating and some oddly shaped chairs/tables.  When we first arrived there was not many people there but about halfway through our dinner the place filled up quick.    We ordered: -pork belly appetizer -King Cali Roll  -Salmon skin roll -Yakuza special roll -Sekushi sashimi 6 piece entree  The pork belly appetizer was very BLAH but I loved the other choices we ordered.  The sashimi was extremely fresh; some of the freshest sashimi pieces I have ever had.  The salmon skin was interesting because it was the first time I have seen a chef actually leave a very small amount of cooked salmon on the skin.  Usually it is all crunch but it was a very nice added flavor having some of the smoked salmon still attached.  The king cali roll was very large but not too much that it annoyed me when shoving it in my mouth.  I love eel so the Yakuza was delish but I could have done without the panko on the shrimp.  Definitely give this place a try especially if you are staying in Paris.",

We split our group into two since they couldn't accommodate to such a large party, which was fine with us. For my table we ordered an assortment of skewers to try, such as the beef, pork belly, shrimp, and some other items I can't remember at the moment. I ordered the pork belly kimchi sizzling plate & a negitoro cut roll to share with the table. My bf ordered the Kimono roll for us to share as well.  The Kimchi sizzling plate was good in my opinion, it came with a generous portion of pork and a free topping, which I choose the fried egg. It was filling and piping hot throughout my meal. The negitoro was also very good. The skewers were just okay, not sure I would order them again for that price. The Kimono roll was standard, nothing too special. Definitely had a kick to it though. Overall this place was good & I would eat here again.",

If you are one of those people that like carpaccios or tiraditos with thinly sliced pieces of sashimi, I wouldn't recommend this place to you. They give you your money's worth, especially if you're eating on the strip. The only thing I didn't really enjoy were the Robata grill skewers, a bit on the dry side, especially the scallops or clams (maybe they were clams).   Sushi isn't all that they have. It's a corporate restaurant, if you're strolling through Paris and want Asian food, stop here. There's Chinese and Japanese. The staff and chefs are very, I mean very non-robotic, they have personality.",

The hostess was very nice and took my order for a Rainbow Roll ($22) and a green salad.  Being gluten-free, she told me that the chef could make me a GF salad dressing for my salad.  She also told me that the Rainbow Roll was a large roll, which I was happy to hear given the $22 price tag.  When I got my food, I carried it over to the the table where my daughter was and upon opening it, could not believe how tiny the Rainbow Roll was!  6 tiny pieces in a tiny container.  It also lacked much flavor.  The salad was just spinach & lettuce leaves, nothing else, and the dressing that the chef made for me was pretty much just GF soy sauce with a little ginger in it.  Such a disappointing & expensive meal, for what I got!!!",

Every single item was amazing. We even had their chocolate cake for dessert which was given to us complimentary by the most gracious host. The staff was so attentive. The host was receptive and personable and didn't mind the questions we asked about the locations the food came from. We would definitely come back when we return!!!!",

We stayed  at Paris hotel a couple of weeks ago , and just happened to walk by this awesome place  before going to see Jennifer Lopez at Planet Hollywood.  We didn't have dinner reservations so we found 3 seats at the sushi bar.  Everything was incredible ! We ordered the salmon rolls , the crab roll and the spicy tuna rolls and the volcano roll which is hot and deep fried on the outside. I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and I have to admit this was the very best I have ever had . Not only is the food awesome but the service was outstanding . Our server was excellent , her name was Chika .  She was so attentive and nice . We had a great time watching  Tuan, our sushi chef in front of us making the most amazing sushi just like he was making a work of art . What more can I say . We loved that place and will definitely go there again the next time we are in Vegas . Thanks to Chika and Tuan for giving us a great experience and a delicious dinner!!!!!!!!",

We sat at the sushi bar and were given menus from this restaurant and the Chinese place next door.  So we had wine and a lobster roll and then shared a Chinese dish.  We absolutely LOVED the freshly made lobster roll -- best we have EVER had.  It was pricey ($20) but definitely worth it.  Nice, generous size roll.  The service was outstanding and quick, even though they were busy.  This will likely be our new favorite stop.",

I absolutley loved the decor and music choice - it felt more like a club or a local joint, than a restaurant inside a casino.  We made reservations for 730 and enjoyed a variety of food. I ordered: - Pork Gyoza: delicious! and beautifully presented with a flower - Salmon Nigiri: incredible, fresh and delicious. The salmon was so tender it melted in my mouth - Kimono Roll (spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, cucumber, balsamic sesame and crispy onion straw) - I didnt really enjoy this roll. The crispy onion on top was almost like hard oatmeal flakes? - it tasted flavorless and was TOO crunchy - to the point of being annoying/painful. It completely brought down the meal for me.  My friend ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box. I had her Miso Soup and some of the fried rice - tasty staples.  I also used the Yelp Check-In offer for the free Cheescake or Devil's Pie -- but recieved Mango Mochi instead (they were out of the other two options). Yum! Cool and refreshing.  Also, I'd rank this as more of a $$$ than a  $$ establishment, as most of the options are $10-20 EACH. And unless you only have one sushi roll or two pieces (pieces, not orders), your tab is going to be higher. My final bill was $52.  I don't know that given all of the other Sushi options in Vegas, that I would return, but I can't say I had a bad experience, so I will give this 4 stars.",

Chirashi don ($22.00): my sashimi had 3 little bones. Not one. Not two. Three tiny bones! I found the first bone inside my sashimi and showed it to my waitress. One minute later I found another one. The slices were very stringy too.  Salmon bento ($19.00): better than my chirashi don. It's sad when you get better cooked food than raw fish at a sushi bar.   FREE CHEESECAKE OR DEVILS PIE WITH YELP CHECK-IN.   Our waitress was very nice, apologetic and comped our meal. That was the first time I was speechless when someone apologized to me. I couldn't even say it's ok. I felt bad for her, but I was very upset.   2 stars!!  Sekushi Japanese Restaurant is not yummylicious!!",

They laid out the skewers with a flower and designed it so nicely. All of them were really good. The scallops were my favorite. The only complaint I have is how small they were. The shrimp were the size of popcorn shrimp. Each portion was super tiny. Otherwise, I would say this is a great deal for the price and location.",

The ramen has more value than the actual sushi   My friends and I stopped by to grab a quick light bite to eat before heading out to clubs for the night. We all used our yelp check in to get free sake which was super worth it by the way.  I ordered the chirashi bowl which came with fresh slices of fish, sushi rice and some fish eggs! My bowl was absolutely delightful and priced at $26! I would say that the value was there because I left the restaurant feeling super satisfied and full.   My friends ordered the spicy tonkotsu ramen and they told me that it was super flavorful with a creamy broth. However I noticed that the ramen did not have any actual thick pieces of pork meat. The ramen only had ground pork which made it a little lacking for me.  We also ordered a salmon roll which I honestly thought wasn't too worth it. The roll only came with 8 pieces and it was super pricy. I think if you come here, you should be ready to splurge a bit due to it being a hotel restaurant.   Overall, my experience here was super satisfying and the service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress came by to check on us often and made sure that we were always having a great time!",

    "text": "Situated along one of the hallways of the Paris hotel, it is a small restaurant with a very modern feel to it: purple/white neon lighting, a neon sign, and modern, wooden decor. I believe there are two sides to the restaurant (or that's what the host told us) and you don't really get a choice of where to be seated. You can tell that the two sides have different vibes; one side of the restaurant, the side we were seated, had very modern vibes with neon lights and top 40 music playing while the other had a more contemporary Japanese restaurant feel to it with chill EDM playing. Nonetheless, the food is the same so don't let the differences fool you.   Service was okay. Our server didn't come check on us at all during our meal. We only saw her when she took our order and when we asked for the check. None of our waters were refilled as well.   I ordered the sliced salmon sizzling plate with noodles, house sauce, and buttered corn. It came to the table on a sizzling plate, so the salmon basically cooked the more it was in contact with the plate. It was really good! The noodles were not soggy, the house sauce enhanced the flavor of the whole plate, and the corn added a nice, buttery touch for the whole meal. I also tried the bulgogi sizzling plate and the meat was juicy and tender.  Overall, this is a good place to give a try. I would definitely come back again to try their sushi.",

There's a really good value.   I just came to meet someone. I didn't want to spend a lot so it was a better choice instead of the fancy French themed restaurants in the casino. This place holds plenty of seating even though it's small. At the front is the menu. We looked it over and found some very affordable items amid the more costly ones. Each of us ordered a sushi roll since they were cheaper. The avocado cucumber roll is about $6, which is one of the cheapest things you can get in any casino on the Strip. It tastes like it was pretty fresh. This was accompanied by more items that increased the value. All the rolls come with edamame. That was a pleasant surprise. I didn't think there would be complimentary anything. This wasn't anything that amazing but it was still good.   The Paris casino has some expensive places to eat. At Sekushi you can eat for cheaper. They still have some high end stuff if you still want to throw away money.",

I can not thank sushi chef Nikko for making my date an unforgettable experience. Everything was seasoned and flavored to our liking and above. I took photos, but they don't do justice to the taste of the meal. I strongly suggest if you are in Paris hotel or in Las Vegas and looking for a sushi restaurant to try Sekushi. Also ask for chef Nikko.",

There are bar and table seatings; I recommend sitting at the bar so you can enjoy the chefs cooking and prepping the food in front of you.  The food is reasonably priced for sushi. There's a lot of variety to choose from: from ramen to sushi, to other cooked dishes. The portions are big so it's definitely worth it. The foie gras is delicious and cheap compared to Nobu in Caesar's. I ate both and the taste is comparable but the price difference is huge.  The chefs can also make whatever dish you can think of as long as the ingredients are available. We wanted something that's not on the menu: uni on baby oyster with a quail egg.  Service is a little slow so order some sake and beer and cheers. We had a large group of 12 so it's understandable. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise and we will definitely be back.",

Even though all tables were filled the service and food preparation was quick for our party of four. If you check in on Yelp they will provide a container of house sake that is enough for four small glasses (see picture). Others in my party elected for the sushi rolls and sashimi, which were on the whole positive. One person did try the Tonkotsu Ramen but was disappointed by the bland soup base. I selected the Shrimp Sizzlin Skillet with noodles in place of rice and broccoli and corn as the two vegetables. The House sauce was similar to a teriyaki but was thin like water (did thicken slightly as some water boiled off in the skillet). Very flavorful and also healthy, not on be less expensive side for Vegas.",

The salad had just the right amount of ginger dressing and the dressing wasn't over powering. The roll was thick with vegetables and the sweet chili sauce accompanied it perfectly. The other dishes ordered were the shrimp skillet with mushrooms and mushroom sauce, the salmon skillet and the vegetable ramen with egg, chicken and pork added. The shrimp dish was good. While I didn't eat it, I did try the mushrooms and they were wonderful. The restaurant had some seasoning on top which really brought out the flavor of the mushrooms. The salmon and ramen dishes were good too. The only dish which I was not totally happy with was the gyoza. It tasted like it came out of the freezer and then cooked.   Overall I totally recommend this place if you're in Vegas, you won't be disappointed in this little gem.",

The sushi is fresh - they give you the option to order with or without rice (sashimi style). The rolls have good / generous cuts of fresh fish, and the staff are all very friendly.   Also, if it's your thing, get the yellowtail collar. Very tasty.",

I also tried the salmon avocado roll which was very fresh and tasty. The food is very reasonably price, especially compared  to the expensive food on the strip!",

Though the rolls are a few dollars more than some of the smaller sushi restaurants, they offered real crab instead of the imitation crab that many restaurants use. We started with the Wagyu skewers as an appetizer, though they didn't bring it out until after our rolls were served. I ordered a rainbow roll and an avocado and eel roll, my husband ordered the sashimi entree. All were very fresh and well prepared and presented.I will definitely come back again.",

Came across this place and decided to try. There's lots of exposure and foot traffic here. It was moderately busy. Lighting and ambience had a hipster feel. Service was below par. They all just wanted to stand around and talk to each other. They have one side that's sushi and one side that's skewers and bowls. We order sushi and skewers. Had the shrimp ceviche, surf and turf roll, king crab roll, pork belly, bass skewer, and the salmon collar. The shrimp ceviche was horrible. The shrimps texture was rubbery. I tried to eat it...I really did, but it had no flavor. The surf and turf and king crab rolls weren't very much better. Rice was dry and fell apart. The pork belly had a good flavor, but the meat was over cooked, so it was dry. The bass skewer was quite tasty. It had a citrus miso glaze that was good. The best part was the salmon collar. It was cooked perfect. The flavor was slightly salty but sweet. If it weren't for the salmon, I'd probably give this place one star for what I got for the price I paid.",

The cuisine quality is at a high bar and definitely at par or even better than New York City. That all changed once we ate at Sekushi in Paris hotel and casino. Started off with the hot sake which was pretty good sake for the price. Nice and smooth. Got the complimentary edamame and went with the safe gyoza appetizer and satisfying till that point. The uni scallop nigi was ok but not as great as i hoped. Ceviche taco again nothing mind blowing. Then our entrees came and went all down hill. My girlfriends chirashi don is cover with thinly sliced sashimi that looks nothing like their pictures i saw on yelp. The yellowtail is all mushy and has a weird stanch while the mackerel definitely got too warm and spoiled a bit. My unagi don was un editable. The whole eel has exceptionally sharp and hard bones in it, all over. I ve never had unagi where it was prep beforehand and deboned. The rice from both our entree is off too. I am puzzles how this place got a 4 star. Definitely one of the most over priced fake japanese food joint i ve ever had. So bad that i had to write my comments on the merchant copy of the receipt i left then and create my first Yelp review to warn others. Will be posting on other food review sites to steer people from wasting money and time  at the place.",

I asked the server what she would suggest for their signature rolls, and she said the Aria O.  Considering that I just wanted a quick meal, one roll was enough.  The Aria O has salmon, shrimp, avocado, mango, jalapeno, micro cilantro and honey truffle aioli. Since I am not a big fan of cilantro, I asked if it would be very pungent in the roll, and she assured me that it would not be overpowering the other elements of the roll. Good!  Out comes the food! Beautiful! Presentation's great!  And this roll had a bold immense flavor. It's a good thing I listened to Sandra's suggestion, she was right, the cilantro was not overpowering. I loved the honey truffle aioli, it made the roll come together harmoniously! Ingredients were fresh, and the jalapeno was just the right amount to make it spicy but not burn your tongue.  I would definitely come back; food, price and service are great!   I had a wonderful experience, and I would certainly come back to taste more of their signature rolls, and I would for sure recommend it to all my friends.",

All other restaurants will offer you a plate of say, 3 or 6 or even 7 pieces. Just Terrible.  The menu needs to change.  Now for the cut rolls. Oh the rolls are just super dinky.   They look like shrunken rolls. What the heck.. They really need to beef their rolls up.  I'd say the only good thing about this place that's good is the service, that's it!",

Definitely one of the best restaurants at Paris.",

I don't usually sushi in landlocked states, but the quality and flavor of Sekushi definitely warranted an exception.  I had:  The beef bao--never had beef before, but this was definitely a little different and very rich. It was messy and the dough fell apart, but I wouldn't change a thing about the flavor.  The Aria O roll was definitely my favorite. It's very spicy, so be forewarned.   We also had the hot spring roll, which was great but served warm, which isn't my preference.  Food great, service slow, but good if you want to take a long time to chat.",

IMHO, the real test of sushi is a chirashi (nothing but raw meat to assess the quality); that's what I bought and it was very underwhelming. Low quality meat, the rice was good but who cares about rice?  House sake had a good flavor. I think the strip is often overrated like this.",

I was dining alone so had a seat at the sushi bar without any problems and was immediately served some warm edamame to get me started and some green iced tea. By the time I was finished I think the staff were a little concerned about how much sushi I managed to shove down my throat- I spent $83 at this place BY MYSELF!  If you're a sake fan I suggest you try a bottle of the Lychee Sake. For $23 it is worth the price and goes down a little too well! For food I ordered the Pork Gyoza, the Wagyu Beef Bun (so tasty and tender), the Yellowtail Ceviche Wonton Taco (super fresh!) plus the Spicy Tuna Hand cut rolls and the Salmon and Avocado Rolls. I definitely could not pick a favourite out of all these dishes as they were all so fresh and so tasty! Highly recommend for some fresh food on the strip. Hopefully will come back before I leave.",

However, what made this place a one star experience was the service. The server Sandra was extremely rude and didn't treat us like guest in the restaurant. She didn't smile, didn't greet us, didn't ask us if we needed anything, didn't offer us water, and didn't check up on us. Basically, a lot didn'ts. Would never come back here again based on the service.",

The sushi is comparable to some of the upscale sushi restaurants at a lower price, but I still think it's pricey...and I'm comparing this to Chicago and NYC standards. I love how we received complementary edamame. We had the Sekushi lobster, Kimono, and Aria O. The kimono is my least favorite. Still good, but I think it's the sauce. I prefer a creamier sauce rather than the balsamic. The Aria O is one of the best rolls I have ever had. There is a crunch component which is really unique. Don't know what it is, but it's fantastic. Wait service is good here too. Since it's a small place, they were all attentive to everyone's needs.",

Both rolls were small, dry and lacking flavor. I think the sushi buffet on the strip is way better than this and that's where'd you'd actually expect it to be not so great.

Our servers were terrific but that is where it all ended.  The edamame they brought us before dinner was very sad looking. I also ordered a glass of Merlot and was brought out a tiny, tiny glass of very mediocre wine.  I figured for the price I paid it should have been much better.  My family ordered sushimi and got one small piece of fish for $12.  I decided to try something different and ordered the wagyu beef and the seared foie gras.  They were absolutely the smallest dishes I have ever been served in my life.  The wagyu was around $15 and only 3 tiny strips of meat.  I had to fold them over just to get a taste of the meat. The foie gras was $36 and 4 tiny slices probably the size of a penny. I was starving and broke by the time I left the restaurant. Would have rather gone to the Dim Sum place next door.  At least I would have been full when I left. With all the great restaurants in Vegas, I will never go back to Sekushi again!!",

We did not specify but assumed everything would come out together but the sushi was brought out one roll at a time all before my bento box. My miso soup came out before the rest of the bento box.  My husband enjoyed the sushi. My bento box was good. It included miso soup, a chicken egg roll, a nice sized piece of salmon, steamed white rice, and a mixed green salad. It was the perfect amount of food for lunch. Our bill was 55 dollars before tip.",

You can go on the cheap with a 7 pc plus roll dinner and buy one get one house sake, or you can go all out with Omakasa, fancy rolls, expensive sake.  The booths are comfortable for a small group.  The sushi bar is good for singles but beware of the somewhat uncomfortable bar seats.  There were a number of sushi restaurants that I considered, and based on price, decor, and authenticity, this was the right pick for me.",

    "text": "Came here last weekend with a craving for sushi while in Vegas. Having eaten a lot of fancy meals in the past week, my boyfriend and I were looking for something more low key. We stumbled upon this place and I was taken in by the awesome authentic looking decor. We were seated with no wait. The service was on point. We each had a sushi roll, a ceviche tuna taco and spicy edamame. Never had edamame served any other way than with sea salt. It was great! I recommend it. And it's ACTUALLY spicy. We were happy with everything. I'm surprised I remembered the name of this place to review it after this weekend!",

The roll was okay, but the nigiri were some of the best cuts of fish I have had in Vegas. My wife got the creamy udon soup which was very well balanced and had several interesting ingredients. Service was prompt and fast and the decor was well done, if a little cheesy with the sample food displayed. Edamame at the table was a nice touch.   During our visit, it was very warm inside the restaurant to the point of almost being uncomfortable but I am not sure if that is a common feature.   Overall we had a great time and will visit again on future trips.",

My favorite was the sekushi rainbow roll. The tempura batter on the shrimp was also excellent, not too much and just the right temperature and texture. We picked up a 20% off coupon at the check in station as well, so look for it! Sorry no pictures, I was too hungry.",

You can tell from the traffics of crowds. I sensed it but still gave a try and I was right about it.  Don't give me wrong, the services are great like the most of restaurants in Vegas. If you believe that the taste of food is your ultimately choices by the end day, this place is not what you would like to go. It does Not taste what what it is worthy based on the location as well as the price. I understand the portion may be varied...  Imaging you can taste raw salts in the sushi rolls. The rice is cheap ones, certainly not the authentic Japanese rice. Shrimp tempura is the typical low-end deep fry style. It was not even well done and worse than Safeway sushi!

It was a good portion and the food was delicious. We both particularly enjoyed the egg roll which was crispy and flavorful. All of the food was served at a desired temperature. The cheesecake stole the chose. Incredibly creamy and just all around delightful!  SERVICE: We visited on a Saturday at noon. We were greeted and seated within minutes. The service was fast and efficient. The servers work as a team to execute orders with high quality and speed. Our server Weethara was friendly and helpful. We waited a minimal amount for our food and had our drinks and complementary edamame to hold us over.   AMBIANCE: They have an upbeat fun vibe. It's noisy because it's near the shops but manageable. Casual. QUALITY/VALUE: This place is designated $$; I agree. It's reasonable. Good value if you're looking for something quick on the strip and craving Japanese.",

Umi shooter - $8 Oyster shooter - $7 Sashim - 12 pieces - $39 Aria  roll - $18 Rainbow roll - $18 Hamachi Kama - $18 Hot sake - $15 Hot tea -$4.5  Is it worth it?  Let's just say, its the experience.  The presentation of the sashim was nice.  Fish were thinly sliced with two pieces that were questionable whether they were the natural color of the fish or whether they were turning into different stages.  Not daring to try.   The aria roll was nicely rolled up in a skinny roll. The texture of the rice is mixed well, the filling is made with real fresh crab meat with maybe lightly salted, as you can taste the freshness of the crab meat.  Topping was salmon cerviche with a creamy sriracha aioli that added the heat to the roll along with the sesame coating on the outside of the roll.  That was my favorite dish. The fish and shrimp on the rainbow roll again thinly strategically placed on the roll perfectly fresh.  The shooters were interesting shots with heavy sake, soy sauce, raw quail egg, and chopped green onion.  Need to chute it down as fast as you can . Hamachi Kama is ok, it would have been better if it has more grilled mark that brings out the chard taste.  Again, it's all about the experience.",

The place is nice and clean, the wait staff was ok.  They do give you free edamame but it was super dry.  I don't think I have ever tasted edamame that was just, blah.  Here is what we had for lunch:  Miso soup:  so salty, like they gave me the bottom of the batch, i had to send it back  King Cali Roll: the first order we got had hair in it so we sent it back.  When they brought the new one, it was not tight at all, the insides just fell out, and it was really dry  Sekusushi sashimi: this was probably the only thing that was good.  At least the fish was fresh.  I really do not like to give bad reviews but I would've given it a 2 if it weren't for the sashimi.  The wait staff did not even apologize for the hair or salty soup.  I do not recommend this place...sorry",

After grabbing Happy Hour drinks and snacks at Alexxa's Bar, we decided to head back through the walkway to take a peek at their menu. They give you a lot of choices, between ramen, sushi rolls, bento boxes, etc., which is good, in my opinion. The vibe of the restaurant totally makes you forget that you're in the Paris Hotel in the middle of Las Vegas, which was probably my favorite part!   We ordered the spicy garlic edamame (amazing), the California roll (safe, but also a boring choice, we should have picked something else), and the Spider roll (delicious!). However, if I could choose again, I would have ordered their diced teriyaki chicken hot noodle skillet! The people sitting right next to us ordered one and it looked soooo good; it also comes out sizzling. Would definitely come back and try something different during our trip, perhaps after some drinking and walking around a lot :)",

The only good thing about this visit was we were seated immediately. After we placed our orders, it took quite a while for our food to arrive even though the restaurant had a few other diners.  The temperature in the restaurant was really warm and very uncomfortable to say the least. A couple next to us even asked to sit \"outside\" of the sushi bar area.  After taking a few bites of my meal, we decided to leave because the heat was becoming unbearable. We had to flag down another server because no one ever came to check on us the entire time. The new server brought us boxes and the check. I was a bit irritated because she stood right at our table and watched me box my leftovers and quickly took the plate out of my hands.  I really like the food here but the entire experience I had that Friday night was horrible.",

For Vegas , the Paris hotel at that - the pricing was awesome. I would eat again next time i stay here!",

Service was good from Yui. Sashimi very fresh and AriaO roll was amazing. Edamame was complimentary and standard. Pass on miso soup - very salty. Chocolate mousse cake - pass also. Overall 5 stars.   Lunch- sat at a table on Sunday afternoon. Service was non-existent that even the hostess came by to see if a server had come by. Unfortunately, never got the young lady's name who was my server.  It wasn't even busy, but she didn't seem to know what she was doing. Sashimi still excellent, but AriaO roll left much to be desired. How was it amazing one night and not a few days later? Portions were much smaller despite its one size for ~$20!!! Should of went with my gut and get a bento box for lunch. Service - 1 star. Food - 3 stars.   Debatable if I will come again, and I frequent Vegas often.",

We arrived to Vegas a little earlier than check in, so we decided to finally try this place out.  We were planning on buffet for dinner, so we ordered 2 rolls here to try: Spicy Tuna cut roll ($9) and Sakura Roll ($24). First impressions, rolls were very small, more like 1/2 size bites or maki rolls. The Spicy Tuna cut roll was not what I expected: chopped up tuna with spicy mayo ON TOP of each piece. The Sakura Roll was very salty, without any soy sauce, which masked the flavors of tuna and whatever else was inside.  The table seating is very underwhelming, doesn't feel like you're in Vegas at all. Try sitting at the sushi bar instead for hopefully better ambiance.  Unfortunately, we will not be coming back for the sushi. I can imagine the bill to grow quite fast if you want to leave feeling full. Almost $50 for a snack and drink before dinner is quite scary even by Vegas standards  I would love to see more noodle options as it's hard to find on the strip, particularly other udon or soba dishes. Hopefully we can give this restaurant another chance somewhere down the road.",

The rice tastes as though it was made a few days previously, cooled and microwaved. The seaweed was so rubbery, because it was old, that it was almost impossible to chew. Speaking of impossible to chew, the actual fish was cut very thick and again, was NOT fresh. Do not eat here. I rarely leave reviews for this but I am afraid someone will get ill. This was really, really terrible.",

I enjoyed the wagyu beef skewer a lot. Beef was cooked to perfection. Mussels were good as well but a little spice to it. We also had the oyster shooter shots. My first time trying it and it was good but strong. We ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner and the sushi combo. Sushi was fresh and good. Size of the fish was cut big so it will definitely fill you up. We had so much food we had no room for dessert.",

This fish was not fresh, nothing was raw and the rolls had so many \"extras\" on them, you could barely see or taste anything. They loooove spicy mayo here too. Do not order the Hot Spring if you don't like mayo. The presentation was horrifying and I sent it back because it was beyond hideous and disgusting.",

I ordered a lobster roll that had avocado and jalapenos, but what really set it apart was it was topped with coriander threads and wrapped in pink soy papper.
