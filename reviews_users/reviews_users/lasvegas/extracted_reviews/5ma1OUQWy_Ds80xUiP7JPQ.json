I love how much more convenient this location is. The interior is super cute with local art on the walls. I'm pretty glad I came in around 11pm because I could only imagine this tiny place getting super packed during lunch/dinner rush. We ordered the Buta and Kinoko burgers and they were yummy as usual, plus the Jazz fries! Like I said in my other review, if you're into sauceyyyyy flavorful burgers, you'll love it!!",

I ordered the chicken katsu burger and jazz fries. The burger was mediocre. They use dark meat in their chicken patties, which tasted like it hadn't been marinated for very long before getting fried. But the sauces were good, it just wasn't enough to save the chicken. The fries were really good. They had special sauce all over and gravy. If I came back here, I would only order their fries so I can try all the flavors.",

    "text": "Burger crew meeting called to order on Saturday, May 21, 2016 at 4:50pm (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash).   Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Between the 5 of us, we ordered 2 Buta Burgers. It's #3: Buta burger (\"Pig\" burger): Fuku patty with miso glazed apple-wood smoked bacon, American cheese, onions and pickled ginger (which we asked for on the side). Finished with Japanese BBQ sauce ($7.99). For $2 you can make it a combo with an order of garlic fries and a medium drink (they upcharge more for the jazz fries). We were not asked how we wanted our burgers cooked, but Trevor said he wanted it medium rare and the cashier said that was how their burgers are cooked. We also got togarashi Garlic fries with banana ketchup and crack sauce ($3.99 normally) and jazz fries - togarashi garlic fries with homemade, brown gravy and crack sauce (normally $4.99).  II. The burgers The consensus was that this burger does not taste like a burger. Dennis said it tastes more like a bao. Sumana has been to Japan and she said that this burger reminded her of a lot of the burgers there. So we asked the cashier and she said that the patties are marinated (which is how a lot of places in Japan do it). The burger had a little sweetness to it and was nice and moist. However, the patty was not cooked to order properly; we ordered medium rare but it was cooked medium to medium well. It was cooked on a grill and had a nice sear, but not a ton of meat flavor. The bacon didn't really have a strong flavor and was kind of lost among the other flavors in the burger. I really liked the pickled ginger, which is not something you typically see in a burger. Maybe that's why we didn't feel like it tasted like a burger. The bun was dusted with flour and was not really gooey like I like my buns to be. It held up and did its job but didn't really stand out.  III. The fries The fries are a little too potatoey and seemed to be single fried. The crack sauce was really good and everyone seemed to like the jazz fries more than the garlic fries.  IV. Miscellaneous Fuku Burger is in a strip mall way off the strip. They are in a building that looks like it used to be a Taco Bell. There is plenty of parking. It is counter service. They call your order by a nickname, which is fun. Trevor got a jelly ice bar thing when he tipped. They have a cool Japanese vibe in here. They have board games to play while you wait. Their music was awesome! It was mostly 90s, early 2000s R&B. One pet peeve was that the menus are inconsistent. The descriptions of the burgers are different when you compare the menu on the wall with the printed menu. This place reminds me of the Humble Potato in LA. They have a very similar vibe and similar menus, but Humble Potato has much better fries!  V. Value Pretty good value!  VI. The verdict The crew had a hard time rating this because it was unlike any other burger we've had. Typically fusion burgers still taste like burgers, but these did not. I really enjoyed it, but it doesn't quite fit into the burger genre. The ratings: 3.3, 3.5, 3.5, 3.7, 3.8.  Next burger crew meeting: Bobby's Burger Palace after we take a little nap! EAT ALL THE BURGERS!!!",

    "text": "Fukuburger is the spot for quality burgers. I've tried the Tamago (which is their most popular), the Buta, and the Katsu, and they are all excellent. The thing I enjoy the most is that each kind of burger (and the sandwich) has a distinction in taste so each burger is different from one another. Their burger meat is definitely the highlight. It's juicy, full of flavor, and the perfect size.  They are somewhat more on the pricey side (close to restaurant prices), but you are also paying for quality. This isn't McDonalds with a factory spitting 100 meat patties out of a machine every 5 seconds.  The fries are very tasty. The only thing is that they are kind of thick, but that's just my preference for thinner fries.   The atmosphere is very laidback as the employees are very welcoming and friendly. The walls are painted nicely with a great design (major props to the artist). The TVs are always playing sports, Power Rangers, and Anime (usually it was Naruto). They even have board games you can play.  Definitely a spot to check out, especially if you and your friends want a new spot to hang out at.  Once you try Fukuburger, every other burger place will not be the same again.",

Also the overall size of the hamburger broke my heart a lil bit lol but I get it..gotta make $$. What I don't understand is the -meal upcharge- $5 to add fries and a drink? I'm no expert but that doesn't make sense?   Everyone seem to have a problem w there service but on my visits everyone was friendly and personable.",

Noise level was moderate and overall a inviting atmosphere.  I waited for about 10 minutes for a katsu burger, when the cook finished with the katsu, I was standing next to the counter and saw that he asked another worker to examine it. The second person looked at the overcooked chicken katsu, nodded and proceeded to make the burger.   He must have thought I wouldn't be able to tell with the excessive amount of sauce he put on there, but the burger was messy, tough to chew and super greasy.   For 8 bucks I'm not expecting some high quality gourmet sandwich but it is should be better than chain restaurant burgers that cost half as much.",

The menu options are limited, however it's bound to please anyone looking to satisfy that burger fix.  Staff was attentive and welcoming, made us feel at ease for being \"Fuku virgins\".  The decor is quite reminiscent of my younger days being into anime and cartoons, with a modern twist.  They have a few board games to appeal to big groups and families dining in.  Very cool concept.    As for the food, I decided on conquering their \"TAMAGO\" burger accompanied by their Togarashi fries and LEGENDARY banana ketchup and crack sauce.  I was glad I did.  The burger was juicy and the egg was delectable.  Definitely legit burger joint.  Thank you, FB gang!  Will be back for more the next time we're in Sin City!",

They provided meals to the police force in the wake of the horrible shooting on the LV strip. This is a small but powerful gesture that was greatly appreciated!   Now, as for the restaurant itself, think 50's burger joint meets anime. It's a cool place with anime art on the walls and ceilings. The menu is just the right size with selections that don't overwhelm you, but all look delicious and will have you scheduling regular returns to try everything. After you place your order you are asked to provide a funny name rather than your own. This catches some off guard so prepare early!   The food itself was great, the burger patties were formed as if they were patted together by hand rather than press and grilled on a flat skillet rather than a grill, charring the flavor and juices into the meat.   The staff was friendly and attentive and the cost was very reasonable.   Likelihood of my return, let's just say imminent!",

The burger patty was juicy and flavorful. Their bread buns are soft and slightly sweet kind of reminded me of those kings hawaiin rolls. I also got to try the chicken katsu burger and it was fried to a nice crispy bite. The food here is great and you can't go wrong with their burgers will definitely want to come back to try their other burgers",

I also ordered the jazz fries, which were tasty and smothered with crack sauce (mayo-based) and gravy. The fries were a bit salty though, since they were salted, then covered in sauce, and I'm not sure that I really tasted the garlic aspect of the garlic fries. I was pretty full after my burger and fries, given how heavy/rich the food was (in a good way).  Service was friendly and there are a few tables inside if you choose to dine in. The decor is very modern with lots of colorful drawings. There is also a stack of board games in the corner if you want to come here and hangout with friends. They also have a loyalty program that you sign up for with your phone number.  Come check out these unique, fairly-priced burgers!",

I may have found the burger of my dreams.   I stumbled upon Fuku Burger past midnight on a Friday night and didn't expect much. I was hungry and they had burgers, end of story. Little did I know, I was about to go on a roller coaster of umami.   I ordered the #4 - Kinoko, and upon first bite, I felt my body transcend into another dimension and I actually watched myself eating the amazing burger I had ordered.   But on a more serious note, the amazing blend of Shitake Mushrooms, Teriyaki and Pickled Ginger complimented the meat extremely well. I also could tell immediately that the patty they used came from high quality beef source, which shows that the owner really cares about the product that he or she is putting out to the public.   As a band manager, I travel a lot, and you better believe anytime I'm in Vegas, Fuku Burger will be a definite stop for me. Bar none, the best burger I've had in my life until this point.   I URGE EVERYONE TO GO HERE.",

I had a hard time stopping so I could snap the picture... it was very tasty, not too spicy, and full of flavor. The fries were also good and it came with some ki nd of dipping sauce. My daughter had the Fuku moco. I sisnt fet input from her yet, but there were no complaints lol. All in all, I would love to come back next time I'm here !!",

    "text": "As you bite through a Fuku Burger, you'll notice quite a few things:  The bun isn't a dry, lifeless ball of sprung dough simply made to act as a vehicle that a slab of beef hitches a ride with -- this is a bun that has actual flavor, and care put into it. It's airy and light, yet has just enough crisp to contribute towards the overall mouth-feel.   The veggies are actually cold. Texturally, they've got the crunch & snap that you only get when the product is fresh. These haven't been sitting, nor have they been kept out in the hot kitchen.   This isn't just a mayo & mustard trope-burger. Instead, you've got a nicely balanced wasabi-mayo (call it an aioli if you want) along with a bit of Fuku Sauce, which has a smoky, Asian-BBQ teriyaki inspired taste that pairs well with the mayo.  This would probably be enough to inspire a return visit. After all, it's more of an accomplishment to somehow manage screwing up a classic like the cheeseburger than it is to do it properly. Yet there's another detail that really makes the difference between \"Sure, I'll come back,\" and \"Wow, this place isn't like the others -- somehow I need an excuse to go back sooner than should be allowed ...\"   BEEF. I can actually taste the beef. Clara Peller can stop searching; I've found the beef, and it's at Fuku Burger, where it's not just a listless, humdrum prose-protein -- here, the beef manages to shine as the bright main character despite a seriously solid, fresh ensemble cast of ingredients. The thick patties aren't gimmicks meant to satisfy your hunger well enough for you to not complain -- they're the star. \"Fuku\" means lucky, which is apt, to put it mildly.   I could stop here. You can now go try for yourself with full confidence, knowing you won't regret it. That, however, would be a mistake. The staff certainly deserves mention, as they've been tremendously warm, friendly and helpful every single visit I've made. That illustrates itself in True fashion when (not if) you tip them, when you're rewarded with a tasty take-home treat to show their appreciation.   Yes, it's anything but roomy inside - but they still offer board games and TV's with anime going from open 'till close; surrounded by hip, cutesy Japanese-style art adorning the walls. Bringing a large crowd here with intentions of eating in may be difficult during peak hours, and no -- there is no drive-thru. That's remedied by extended dining hours, and a meal that's certainly worth the trip, even if it's taken back home to enjoy. You'll know when your order is up, because they'll ask you for a unique nickname to call out when the time comes ... and when the time comes, you'll truly understand why it's the customer who is the \"Lucky\" one.",

There are other fast food joints, restaurants and boba/dessert places nearby as well as Chinatown I believe.   Parking - lots of free parking in this shopping center. Way better than having to pay for strip parking.   Food - I really like this small compact menu as it would be harder to pick a delicious burger then! I ordered a tamago burger, which was delicious. Add the Sriracha and it was perfect!! The egg was nice and juicy, I wish I got a money shot of it as I cut it though! :( the crispy onion pieces on top definitely added texture and flavor to the burger.   Jazz fries - gravy with another sauce on the fries.. Reminds me of poutine fries haha. It was ok for me, I rather have had the garlic fries. The adding of Sriracha made it better.  The only downside for me was that I smelt pretty bad coming out of the place and didn't notice it at the time inside. :(",

The burgers themselves are delicious. I love the Fuku Burger (their #1). As a burger lover, one issue with a lot of burgers is their monotonous, heavy feel. However, almost every burger at Fuku Burger has a pickled element, which cuts through the burger meat and fills your mouth with some added flavor.  Don't miss out on their fries. Their fries are crazy delicious. The crack sauce they come with is also pretty fantastic.  Fuku Burger also lets you choose how to cook your burger and uses nice irregular patties (unlike the perfect McDonald's circles). Overall Fuku Burger has been consistently delicious with new twists on some regular classics.",

My husband and I came in for lunch and I wasn't super hungry, so we split a combo meal - a burger with garlic fries. When it came out and I saw the fries, I told him I didn't want any of the burger. The fries were gorgeous and were cooked perfectly, but didn't have enough garlic flavor. They seemed a little overpriced, but if they had more seasoning I probably wouldn't mind. I love a well cooked fry.  The interior of the restaurant is very cute and has a well-defined aesthetic. I love that they had tvs showing a range of different things (including a gaming feed - that was cool). This place is small - don't bring a huge group. The service was fast and the servers were friendly.   My husband told me that there was no way I was allowed to rate this place less than a four, though, because he is in love with their burgers. He tried this place two weeks ago and every time I bring up burgers he tries to drag me here so he can try another one. That has to say something about how good they are, right? I'll update this review when I try their burgers.",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of Fuku Burger since they had their food truck. So, imagine my pleasant surprise to drive past an actual brick and mortar location!   The decor inside is very pop art, hip and happening type of scene with a street art meets k-pop feel. The menu is pretty simple and they do serve alcohol.  My favorite is the fukuburger that comes with the egg in it. I forgot the name of it but there's only one with the egg so you can't miss it. The sauce that goes with the fries is also ah-mazing!!   Super friendly atmosphere. And when you order, they ask you what you want your \"order name\" to be. If you let the cashier choose it for you, don't be surprised to hear things like, \"B-Money your order is ready.\" Or even, \"Snap Crackle Pop, order up!\" It adds to the fun and hip atmosphere of the place so it's not your typical burger joint.  The patties are handmade and the flavor gives the burgers a distinct yumminess that you cannot go without trying.  Not your average American burger joint though, that should definitely be noted. This place is more of a Japanese cuisine fusion burger joint.   You gotta try it though. Definitely unique but will leave you craving for more!",

Honestly I'm stoked they open a one in China Town besides the truck and the one in Las Vegas blvd. One beacuse tracking fown the truck is hard since it's no where near where I live and two driving in LV blvd is just asking for a never ending migrain. So today had the pleasure having fuku burger for lunch with my sis. Had to warn you though you will not find parking closer to the restaurant. I had to park way on the other side of the parking lot on 168 Market. But its worth it!   Ordered Tomago burger, Katsu burger and Togarashi garlic fries to go and glad I did beacuse the restaurant was packed! What can I say they except were bomb! Chicken katsu was so big my sis had to cut it in half. But hey no complain here. Tomago burger is exactly the way I like it! Crunchy fried onions, slightly runner egg and well done patty. Had to say I am still full and this would be my go to burger place from now on.",

I realized the Sierra Mist lacked the sweet syrup taste and it tasted like club soda instead. The woman came by and informed me they just changed the Sierra Mist machine and Offered to replace my soda. The food was good. I rated at as a 3 because I guess I was expecting it to be much better. I will probably go back but it would not be my first choice.",

Definitely upgrade to jazz fries. It's like the garlic fries but with additional gravy. Definitely  reminds me of poutine but replace the curd cheese with fuku Crack sauce. Tamago burger is more special (but a little sweet) than buta which only adds bacon, not Japanese braised pork. My friend ordered Kinoko with mushroom and he said it's pretty unique & delicious. Fuku burger is just ordinary. If you tip them, they'll shout tipping jelly & you'll get a jelly stick *lol*",

It turned out to be a wonder Meal experience with awesome art work on the wall with its hip atmosphere.

You walk in to an active atmosphere of happy music, chill vibes and a hypnotic smell of deliciousness coming from the kitchen. The space is perfect for this cute burger joint. You walk by a wall of vibrant stickers asking for attention. As you look up, you see several TV screens one that includes anime, gamers corner and other entertainment for everyone.   The first screen shows the food selections. They also have little pamphlets with the menu items. The six burgers they have are Fuku, Tamago, Buta, Kinoko, Karai and Chicken Katsu.   I have tried both the Tamago and Katsu. They are both incredibly delicious. The tamago has quite the flavor; you bite into it while the egg coats the inside fuku patty. This burger is packed with crispy onion strings and packed with a wasabi teryaki sauce. And OMG what a party for my taste buds. If you are looking for an adventurous burger to try, it's time. You have no excuse this is your push to try it.  The Chicken Katsu,  was also a delicious choice. This crispy chicken is drizzled with katsu and crack sauces (whatever crack sauce is it's addicting, maybe thats why).   The jazz fries were a little salty for me, maybe I'll stick with the garlic fries next time. I've ordered from the same gal twice and she's pretty amazing. She's always upbeat, friendly and charismatic, go you girl!  They ask for a silly nickname to be called out when your order. I have used Yolo Frodo and Jin Kazuya the times I've been. They definitely say it out loud for everyone to hear, which I love. There's always a sense of community when it comes to silly humor.   They do have board games at fukuburger. However, be careful of getting your greasy fingers on those board games. Please be mindful that other people will be using the games.   I always comment on bathrooms too. Their bathrooms were super clean!!! It was well maintained so kudos guys!.   Needless to say, I'll be dragging unsuspecting friends to this heavenly burger place. Thank you for your wonderful service, vibrant atmosphere and mouthwatering food. :)",

Pleaaaase get their crack sauce it's magical it's been months and I still think about it with some fries.   The spot isn't small but it's not crazy big. They have booze yasss and games so enjoy your food a drink and a game",

I always get the #2 combo with the tamago burger (fried egg). A little messy when the egg yolk gets crushed, but overall a great burger! Always consistent flavor and the crack sauce for the fries is special. Cool peeps behind the counter and they yell out something when you leave them a tip. #2 combo is a monthly \"must have\". Solid burger stop A++++!",

The burger didnt dissapoint it was really good and the fries was perfect. It was also cool of them asking an anime nickname while they are preparing your order. The only small complain i have is that the fries came with a tiny catsup serving, for anyone who likes their fries with lot of catsup ask for extra catsup :)",

This review is for the #1 Fuku Burger and the Jazz Fries. When we ordered, the cashier was clearly tired and was ready to go home. Regardless, customer first, right? When someone in our party asked for recommendations, the cashier said she doesn't eat meat. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Maybe I can overlook the service if the burgers are a home run.  The patty in the burger was thick and cooked well. It was juicy and flavorful. Everything else about the burger wanted me to crave In-N-Out. The sauce was underwhelming. I didn't taste much of the wasabi in the mayo. Tasted like simple mayo. What they call the Fuku Sauce was not much of a sauce.  The Jazz Fries were boring. Basically, it's a bunch of frozen fries fried then drizzled with what Fuku calls a \"crack sauce\" and some gravy. Again, the gravy and sauce didn't really make an impact to the fries other than some \"liquid\" texture. What really brought the fries downhill was it was too salty - too much of that Japanese red pepper forced me to not even finish my fries.  Cranky service, decent burger, and salty fries round up to **.",

And at ~$8 a burger vs $16, I consider these burgers excllent value.  I got to try the #1 Fukuburger and the #5 Karai and between the two, I preferred the Karai.  It was more unique and the slight kick made the whole thing more tasty.  I'm a spice lightweight and I didn't find the habenero kabayaki too spicy at all.  We also got the jazz fries and the garlic fries.  Not bad, not standouts though.  The only caveat I'd say about Fuku burgers is that they do feel quite greasy and heavy after the fact.  Something to keep in mind if you're going to be on the road for a while after or plan to go on amusement rides or something :p  That said, this is definitely a place I will be keeping in rotation :)",

    "text": "Always Always been Huge fan of FuKu Burger. My memories all started with the original food truck. I would go online and see the revolving spots around town get my Fuku Burger on. The  truck (one that could never miss with the bright red colors and so much personality in the logo) still to this day badass the whole look and truly stands out from other food trucks. Anyway it been years since the last time had Fuku Burger. I am always happy seeing small business owners succeed in Vegas. Think they went from food truck to two sit down locations. WELL DONE. So one day post workout had urge for good old fashion burger and fries. I like perfect time cross off another bookmark.   Fried Egg on just about anything is heaven on earth. On top of burger or sandwich no way can go wrong. In my mind. Tamago burger. I think Tamago burger was the first time had fried egg on burger. Lasting memories......Honest years later those same memories were on point! The bun nice fresh, toasted perfect, the fried egg was nice and runny (the golden sauce truly brings the whole burger together with the fried onions, and the burger sauce), the burger cooked perfect, and the best part is still finger licking messy. I went through troll of napkins. I usually get regular fries. I tried the jazz fries. I love all the stuff on top. Basically loaded fries with cheese and not sure rest but all made for awesome side of fries.   Not just only the food but Fuku Burger it the whole experience. I know food truck to restaurant might lose some of that vibe. I was impressed really felt like hitting the food truck all over again. The people work at Fuku Burger got high energy, positive vibes, always smiling, and awesome come into restaurant place order feel that excitement. The whole ask you for name (I never had courage make something up cool) still the same. Once food done they call out whatever name you tell them. Still get jello stick when leave tip for the cooks/staff.  The simplicity of the menu six different burgers and couple sides. I enjoy because see chain restaurant with novel menus you lose sight of quality and doing food right. The food at Fuku Burger has always been on point for me. Nice is there place that can sit down instead of food truck. Another thing nice is they have few different board games that anyone can play at the restaurant. Just make sure put it back cause community board games. They play current pop music. Inside it is small but love the decor. All the asian theme from on of the television on asian station, teddy bear asian artwork, and definitely lot of asian influence.   If want different kind of burger (they also have chicken katsu sandwich not just burgers) and cool vibe someplace chill with friends. Fuku Burger is great spot off the strip. One that plan on coming more often since on my side of town.",

I had already tracked down a bubble tea a few blocks away, so I just ordered the Kinoko burger, with shiitake mushrooms, ginger and a wasabi mayo.  The meat was beautifully done, and the mushrooms were sauteed in a sauce that was delicious.  This was a messy, but outstanding burger.",

If you want a standard burger, don't come here. Although, my very \"vanilla\" son was able to order a plain cheeseburger, the burgers here are interesting and out of the ordinary for a fast service burger place.   The decor is fun and colorful, with screens playing Anime and video games. They also have many different board games to play while you wait.   I've had the Kinoko, Tamago and the Buta. My favorite of these was the Kinoko. I am still excited to try the others, as well. Whatever you do, make sure you upgrade to Jazz fries. Those things are the sh*t! I do end up with quite the stomach ache every time I eat them, but it's totally worth it, and it's probably because I devour them quickly.   Oh, and guess what else! They have a happy hour with half-off beers!!!! What more could you ask for?",

Then they had another location, then a location at Linq, and now Chinatown. Actually, it's around the corner from the dirt lot they used to have their truck at. Cool! I wasn't sure if it would hold up in a new environment, but I'm happy to say the burger is almost as good as I remember. The price is now up to $8 + tax, but it's still not a terrible price. My burger is the tamago burger, and as the owner once told me, the meat is high quality and it wouldn't be the same without great quality meat. So True. Good stuff, and I'm happy they're still going with the same funky spirit they always had. Good job, guys!",

Unfortunately, I was extremely hungry the day I came, so I wasn't in the mood to be adventurous. I got the safest thing on the menu that I knew I would eat a lot of--the katsu burger. Little did I know how massive each burger is... Despite my hunger, I was unable to finish my food. The burger was pretty flavorful, though the slaw wasn't, and the fries were actually pretty good for looking so average (maybe the crack sauce helped). Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, and though I don't see myself returning whenever I return to Las Vegas.  My boyfriend ordered the sandwich with fried onion, beef, and an egg, however we aren't sure of the name. He described it as \"disgustingly good\", and I don't know what that means but he ate it all and I didn't get to try it.  Don't forget to tip them! Free jellies abound!",

Burger that comes with a sunny side up egg. So bomb and satisfies cravings so well. And you have to get it with the jazz fries. Don't miss out on JAZZ FRIES.

What brings me back is their number #2 Tamago burger. I love how thick their burgers and the juiciness and perfectly medium cooked patty. I have tried everything on their menu and their specialties.   My favorite is their Tamago and their Loco Moco. It's just something about that fried egg that makes my meal taste great.   Their burgers are really unique and probably my 3rd favorite is the Katsu burger. Burgers always go well with fries and I love their special \"crack\" sauce. I always ask for a couple extra on the side because it's that good.  By far this is my favorite location in Chinatown because their other mortal spots they had the parking was so far and it is always hard to get around on the strip.   This restaurant feels I guess you can say a comfortable atmosphere and while you're waiting for your food or eating they have classic board games to play. Friends and I were playing UNO and oh this location serves alcohol!   The servers and cooks are really cool and I've became friends with a few of them. After you order they ask for a funny nickname and it's always fun to use unique silly names so when your order is ready you will definitely know it's yours instead of a boring number.  Thanks Colin and workers! Keep up the awesome work",

Oh and be prepared to give a \"hero's name\" to be called by when your food is ready (optional but fun if you want to be creative). I am already a regular since I'm lucky enough to live nearby...",

    "text": "We came during our Vegas trip after seeing them on multiple television shows. Happy to say that they have earned their reputation. We ordered the tamago and buta burger combos. Everything was incredibly delicious. Many people have tried to make Asian burgers, but Fuku Burger succeeds with great flavors and balance. You can taste every element; the beef, pickles, cheese, fried onions, and sauces. Fries could have had more togarashi, but not a big deal. Staff are friendly and there are fun works of art on the walls. Space is smaller than what is seen on TV with about 7-8 tables plus some counter seating. Also was not as busy as expected. Will definitely come back every visit.",

Update: Since speaking with their owner Collin about the issue, he was not aware and has since taken action to fix the premature closings. I still believe there are a few unenthusiastic employees who should not be working there, or at the very least not in the front of the house, but as long as the food is good and the service is acceptable, I will continue coming.  I have a lot of respect for Collin for reaching out to unhappy customers. I'm a business major and what he did is how a proper manager should act and care for their business. Thank you again.",

    "text": "I was always curious about Fuku Burger, but never found myself making the trek to their original food truck or their brick and mortar location on the strip. When they're Chinatown location opened up in the short-lived White Rabbit space, I had to see what the hype was about. Sometimes, I don't want a good ol' fashioned American burger. Sometimes, I'd rather have a burger that reminds me of the Amazing Aloha from Jollibee in its meat quality and sweetness factor haha. We will usually get the Kinoko (mushroom) burger or their Fuku burger (which is just a normal cheeseburger). We jazz it up with jazz fries on the side, which they pour a bunch of sauce into. Is it the most flavorful burger and fries you're ever going to have? Probably not, but there is something about it that is comforting to me. I think it's the Jollibee reminders though, since the gravy is a bit watered down too and growing up I've always dipped my Jollibee fries in the ChickenJoy gravy.   I've read good and bad reviews from their different locations, but it's definitely a place you should try at least once. Have a nickname ready! They'll use that nickname to call our your order. One of the guys here does a particularly perfect and hilarious announcement of any name he's given. They also have two TVs, so good place to eat and catch any games. I would say the cashiers could be a bit more informative about the menu and engaging, but they're also cleaning up tables so I can see why they might not always have the time to interact. The tap water here also had a bad metallic taste, so I always bring a water bottle or order soda here.",

Even though I love Asian flavors and there are some sweet burgers out there that I dig, I'm more for the savory aspect.  I decided to give Fukuburger another shot. This time, I got the Buta burger.  Honestly, the flavors were great. But the burger was a cooked to a medium well, which is not my cup of tea.  All and all it's a decent burger just wanted more savory in it. But Good bun, and their fries are especially good!  More reviews at foodingwithbobo -instagram",

However I took advantage of an out of town guest and we came for some late night grub.  I ordered the tamago burger. It was tasty. I liked the flavor profile that the sauces brought. Although there's wasabi mayo which likely added to the flavor profile but didn't seem to add spice. I did see a recent review complaining of a raw or bright pink burger. Mine was at the other end of the spectrum, definitely over done. The fries were crispy and tasty, I agree that they are not bursting in garlic flavor. I liked the crack sauce, which I think is mayo based.    My eating partner had the chicken burger, she didn't finish it. It was also over cooked. The outside of the chicken was past golden brown to a dark brown and apparently very dry.   Good burger joint, worth a stop,  but I'm still looking for the best burger in vegas.",

But I'm in Vegas, right?  Take a risk. Time for a gamble. VEGAS!  Well let's just say this is the only gamble I won that weekend.  I had the Buta  and jazz fries, just the way they came, without special requests. They were fantastic!  The flavors!  The textures!  It's was all good!  When my wife couldn't finish her fukumoco, I ate a few bites of that. OMG!  Delicious!  When my sister in law couldn't finish her naga dog, I ate a few bites of that.  Are you kidding me!  When my aunt couldn't finish her chicken katsu...you get the point. I had a few bites of half the menu and each one was like Asian/American heaven. If it weren't for my cousin's wedding, I would proclaim that Fuku Burger was the highlight of the weekend!  But believe me when I say, I was hoping the ceremony would end early enough for me to grab another buta burger. It didn't.",

If you dont drink beer, no worries, they serve coconut juice, thai tea, and soft drinks. Make sure to ask for extra crack sauce to dip your burger and fries. I love that they support people in the service, and offer a military discount. 10/10 would come back for more",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Fuku ever since the first time I stopped by the Foodtruck at a Westside Wednesday event years ago. Since then I've stalked their truck on numerous occasion and various events. It honestly feels a little weird to be able to sit down at a table and enjoy a Fuku meal.I think that they should put a set of Home Depot buckets in the restaurant somewhere.  I can proudly say that the quality and taste is the same as you would have found on the Fuku truck that made its brand famous.   My default order here is: Karai (Spicy) Burger: topped cucumbers, peppers and avocado cream (I think)   Jazzy Fries  The Lady Tamago Burger: fuku burger with nori, fried onions and egg Regular fries w/ crack sauce on the side.   The burgers here have an asian flare to them but are not obnoxiously off the wall in any way that would detract from the burger or turn off the burger purist. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Bachi but t's unfair to compare Bachi to Fuku as they are very distinct and different with their creations. I think Fuku creations are delicious because of their subtleness with asian flair which results in well balanced flavors. Take for instance the wasabi mayo and the avocado cream sauces don't overpower the burger but rather accentuate the burger and its toppings.   I know that this sounds like fancy food snob talk but it's the truth. If you don't believe me then go and try Fuku for yourself. If you don';t trust me then go Fuku yourself but add a c and subtract u.   Eat with confidence.  -P",

    "text": "well, coming from Los Angeles, i am already familiar with this DELICIOUS establishment. You can read my review about the location in Hollywood that closed down here: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/fuku-burger-los-angeles?hrid=RF-w9YK0wH7RBFtM1G-D_Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\">yelp.com/biz/fuku-burger...</a>  After recently moving to Las Vegas, I found myself not wandering the strip for some commercialized BS burger like you can get @ Gordan Ramsay crap restaurant at the PFF (ph, get it?) but driving around the outskirts looking for some good, local spots. Craving a burger we just searched for burger and boom, there Fuku was. While driving i was a little skeptic that it was from the original owner and the same as the location in Hollywood. Well, a few days later I stopped by and was very happy about the results.  The spot is in a small, stand alone burger stand on Jones Blvd. completely opposite to what was over in Hollywood. That place was pretty massive. So this new spot is decked out with Mr Fuku's wise cracking, in-your-face-oh-well style and charisma at a much smaller, personal feel kind of space. There are punch lines and attention grabbers from the entrance to the bathroom.  I walked up to the counter and literally started to salivate enough to the point that it might have looked disgusting when i opened my mouth to request the #5 Karai burger (which if you read my review from the Hollywood location, it is the same burger!)  as I ordered it, i realized that i can't choose the \"hotness\" of my burger! Well that was a little bit of a let down, because over the course of numerous trips to the Hollywood location that is one of the draws i loved was telling the server to hit me with a 10 on the spicy scale.  so i ordered the #5 combo, took my pepsi and sat down waiting, kind of bouncing my leg hoping i was going to get what i had been missing once i realized the closure in Hollywood to now. a few minutes past by, just the right amount of time and my food was up.  the presentation doesn't do the foods quality and taste justice. it comes in a basket with the same paper it sat on in the Hollywood location. the fries i got were the standard seasoned fries, and those were delicious. i had extra hot sauce added to my burger so i could see it dripping off the side. honestly i just dove right in with a fork because i knew it was going to get messy, and i was right.  the first taste to the end had nothing but complete satisfactory with each bite.  The burger and fries were delicious. I went back today and had the sauce on the side, that way i can add the sauce to the burger as i need to.  No complaints at all. Mr Fuku, you got a fan back!",

The whole place is decked out in the finest of Otaku decor, from comics, to anime, to video games.  It's the perfect backdrop to some really tasty burgers and excellent service.  While I missed their food truck, I was pleasantly surprised by their fun attitudes.  The burgers are great, with a lot of unique ingredients and very flavorful.  My burger had (among other things) an egg on top of it, resulting in this delightfully messy meal.  And the service was fast, providing a hot and very large order of tasty burger goodness right in front of me.  I absolutely felt full after my meal, which usually makes me want to hide out for a nap.  At the end of the meal, they gave these fun jelly treats in a little tube.  Nice little alternative to the standard mint experience.  I loved the vibe, the service, and the food.  Definitely a great place to get your unique hamburger on, and a place that I would gladly revisit again.  Recommended.",

They both were okay, but really needed sauce to give them flavor. The price seems a bit higher as well which I understand that being in a store vs a truck.  Update: It's great to see that the owner of a restaurant is so willing to make things right. I have to say that for me changes my mind about the whole situation. I'll have to give it another try !",

It had sweet crunchy onions, very similar to french onions. Maybe they were French onions? Not sure but it was full of flavor. I have not had a burger that good in a while. The bun was a bit too greasy but I don't mind it once in awhile. My friend got their pork burger (bacon) and she was amazed with her choice as well. The garlic fries were also really good! Like the ones you buy at ball games. I wish that there was a location closer to the south west area. I'll definitely try this place again.",

I got the chicken sandwich which I felt was dry and the taste was a little weird.  I don't know if it's because it had too much special sauce on it or what.  We also got the gravy fries which is essentially poutine and those were actually really good!

This location was a quirky little fast food restaurant which was clean and had a good amount of customers. We ordered the Mushroom Burger and Pork \"Bata\" Burger. Both were tasty. I like the gingery fusion of flavors in the Mushroom Burger. The prices for the burgers are ok. I would have probably tried the Katsu Burger also if the individual Burgers were cheap enough rather than buying combos. The Garlic fries were ok - not much Garlic there. The jazzy fries were more tastier with the gravy/mustard mix. I would come back if I'm in the area to try some other items.",

The bun was toasted nicely to give a slight crunch before sinking your teeth into the burger combo. The sauce smothered every inch of the burger and it was truly memorable. The fries were ok. Even with the sauce, it was still ok. The price of a burger, drink, and jazz fries were slightly less than $15. Typical of food truck pricing but high for a brick and mortar burger restaurant. The environment here is chill. The staff were friendly and when you order you come up with a unique/funny nickname for them to call your order. The trash area has the tiniest hole for those that want to origami their burger wrapper into the trash bin. There are games to enjoy while you wait, and it does seem to get busy fairly quick. Overall a decent burger to splurge on for those craving this medley of flavor.",

I'm happy to see fuku has done well for itself and has an establishment!   I ordered a #2 - the one with the egg - with some jazz fries. I was pretty excited to have this burger since I haven't had it in years! This thing is huge and super packed with ingredients lol. I finished half of the burger and was pretty full. It was okay. I felt like it was too salty and really greasy. I mean obviously it's a burger and it's not healthy lol but a little too much salt and grease for me. The jazz fries though... that's where the money's at!! The crack sauce is just that - crack! Really tasty. I wish the fries were more crispy though but the sauce made up for it.",

The burger came out in less than 10 minutes and was cooked perfectly. After finishing my meal I decided on another beer in which the keg had blown, as I have frequented establishments with kegs I do know this can be a process. I simply asked if the can beer was the same price and was told it was more expensive. However the employee did not hesitate to offer me one of the can beers in place of the draft and yes I obliged. Visiting this restaurant was a wonderful experience and I will definitely recommend and return!",

So far I've had a 100% success rate with eateries like Hash House a Go Go, Shake Shack, and BURGR so the pressure was on to impress!   Judging by the looks of the exterior, I was a little weary. I mean clearly it was an old Taco Bell building. They didn't change anything about that.  The interior had the bones of a Taco Bell, but with an Asian anime and cartoon feel. Just like the pictures!   We ordered and got two beers since it was happy hour.  The Jazz fries were delicious. Crack sauce (which I believe is some sort of Sriracha aoli) and gravy. Mmmm! Our burgers were cooked perfectly and my egg yolk bursted when I cut into my burger *yaasssss!!!*  The strip mall Fuku Burger is in is definitely Asian, lots of pho eateries and Chinese restaurants. So much to look at!!! It's out of the way for tourists and a great find off the beaten path for locals but given the opportunity we will definitely be back!!!",

Come to find out that this dude owns a burger joint here in Vegas. It's called Fukuburger. I let him know that I always wanted to stop in and grab a burger, but for some reason or another I haven't. He said \"let me ask you this, what kind of food do you like?\" I was like hello! Everything except seafood. He was like ok, cool! \"You need to stop by and get you one\" them you handed me a biz card and said \"your first burger is on me\" super cool! So here I am at the Fukuburger spot. Dude the burgers are amazing! Fries are cooked just right! Colin fukunaga this place is the new burger spot! Thank you bro!",

I ate it quicker than I've eaten anything in a long while. My BF ordered the Tamago burger which was still good but not nearly as good as the Karai burger... ( we cut off a piece of each others and tried each one)  We also tried the Jazz fries which were amazingly good! I will be back as much as I can to this place.  I recommend it highly to burger lovers out there!!!  I also love the decor with the anime paintings and the fighting game in the background.  Make sure you tip and get a tip jelly too!",

The tamago burger is excellent.  The egg, the fine onion strings, great patty, delicious sauces and soft bun worked really well together.  It was love at first bite.  I took a bite of the Kinoko burger which had shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, and the same sauce as tamago (terikyaki and wasabi mayo) it's okay.  The realy winner here is the Tamago.  Note that the burger is pretty big and if you are not a big eater you can share it.  If you are a group not everyone need to order the combo as the serving of fries is huge and can be shared.  They ask you for a fun unique nickname for your order...how cute it that? The decor is very hip with art for sale but an incredible artist.  See the photos I posted.",

    "text": "I had my doubts about this joint, but overall I'm gonna say that I really like it here. I walked in and I had to take a moment to comprehend what was going on inside. Today was my first time here and I guess it clearly showed. I was helped out by Elise who gave me a good rundown of all the menu items and gave me some personal recommendations as well. She was helpful, patient, and cute too. ;) You can even choose a nickname for your order and they don't care if you swear. I used 'Kyouchan' because that's what my Japanese family and friends call me. Nothing funny or interesting. Just the first thing that popped into my mind. So I ended up getting a Tamago (egg) Burger and it turned out very well. The garlic fries were tasty and I liked the dipping sauces that they provided as well. The portions were bigger than those at Shake Shack for about the same price.  My dining experience was pretty trippy. The two TVs that were on had some old-school Sentai () and Ultraman () episodes going on, complete with monsters crushing Tokyo city, five characters combining into one gestalt hero and the whole deal. The music playing was some 90s rap too which provided an interesting contrast. And last but not least, as I was eating, I noticed that the paper used to line the basket says \"!\" which more or less means \"Die you fucking asshole!\" So obviously being politically polite isn't on the top of this place's priority list which is very refreshing in my opinion. I had a mild chuckle out of everything here and an overall pretty good experience. It's close to my work too, so I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the items on the menu.",

I've had much better tasting burgers that were half the price. I'd rather go to In-N-Out than eat here, honestly.   Second, the flavors were too overpowering. There was too much teriyaki/soy sauce based sauce dripping all over. Then there was kimchi slaw. Then there was like a spicy mayo on there. It was just too many flavors clashing with each other. Also, it was too salty. In terms of the fries, you have to pay extra for them. It doesn't come with the burger. It's just some crinkle cut fries with seasoning on them. I think I can make them from ingredients from my local Von's.   Lastly, this place was nothing special. The interior was kind of cool and cute, but it's just a small little restaurant where you order, they call your number, and then you pick up your food. Food was blah, and the price did not match the food I ordered. Sounds like I'm being salty cuz I am, and the food was too. Probably won't be back again...",

I especially liked that you can give a funny name and they actually call it out . Super cute place would definitely come back .   I got the #3 Buta burger sooooooo savory and juicy .  My wife got #2 the popular tamago burger . It comes with egg and a different kind of savory sauce .   The Jazz fries are pretty good but not to my taste buds . The mayonnaise they use is too sweet for my liking . Other than that really great",

I was having a really rough day, but this place just beams happiness. The plaza where it is located is really busy but Fuku has some parking spots for their customers (Yay!). The costumer service is fantastic... I really felt like I was welcomed. The cashier was very helpful in explaining my choices and she was fun. When we ordered our food and they wanted me to use a \"funny\" name... so I chose Primrose Everdeen, and of course, I yelled \"I volunteer!\" Got a few laughs.   They also have free WiFi and some board games to play. When you tip they yell, \"Tip Jelly\" and they give you a jelly thingy. lol   They are open late too... so I'll probably will be back during one of those late night cravings.   The mushroom burger",

    "text": "After sampling some food from the food truck location (near the commonwealth) and feeling very impressed, we decided we had to try more once we were in a less inebriated state. The very next day.  The burgers are unique and very juicy; I can't imagine anyone would ever complain of dryness to their food. The sauces and spices that are infused in the burgers make for a very different burger experience, and in this case different is good. Crack sauce is great too, goes with everything.  Their portions aren't huge but it's definitely enough to hit the spot. However, Prices are a little high for the atmosphere and cuisine. A combo will run you $13.50 which are sit-down restaurant prices, so that may be enough to turn some people off. The location  is quite small as well so be prepared to push some tables together if you're in a group.  Also, come with a \"funny name\" to give them when you order your food--they'll ask you for one to call when your order is ready. Some to try:  Tits McGee Boner James ManWaffles Justice Beaver.  Happy Burgers!",

But my first time wasn't what I hoped for. I took the cashiers suggestion of the naga dog over the crispy chicken sandwich and garlic fries over the other options. Fries were great and the white sauce was nice.  The naga dog was expensive $13 dollars for the meal. The size was pretty large and difficult to eat.  Pretty spicy which I'm not a fan of and wasn't warned. Would I go back? Yea I rather spend my money with small business and help them grow even ifs it's not a lot. But the price is high and that will limit me going there and recommending it I can't maybe next time. Thanks for the amazing fries.",

After always seeing the fuku burger trucks at foodie fest and so forth usually with a big line I had held off due to not wanting to wait. On a Sunday night a while back while driving by the area with my wife we noticed they had a restaurant and decided to give it a try. Now we have had burgers from BURGR, Samy's LA pastrami, Bachi burger and a couple other staples in the Vegas valley and I've got to say for the price, it's really hard to beat Fuku burger. I had the Jazz fries and the Tamago burger while my wife had the regular fuku burger plain as she is a picky eater. Let me tell you that it's difficult to find a place my wife likes with her picky food taste and with the exception of not having mustard they won her over with the quality of the food. I would put this burger up to the challenge with those above mentioned restaurants and this would still probably win and it won't necessarily hurt your wallet. You can taste the quality of the food and the flavor combos are awesome. Definitely going to be coming back here whenever we are in the area and will be giving this as a recommendation to people who want to know a good place to eat. Service also was very friendly and down to earth which was icing on the cake. Keep it up fuku burger you guys are doing great work!",

Another was their fries with their speciality sauce and gravy. I like to ask them to have the sauces on the sides separately so I can dip the fries into them, but it usually comes to you with the fries covered in the sauces.  Another thing I like is how they ask for a nickname to call you when your order is ready. So try to come up with a funny and cool name!",

The wall decoration are like Japanese graffiti characters. I would love to check out the other locations. Definitely will be back and will try other burgers with the bun next time.",

    "text": "While staying in Vegas for a work conference, I really wanted to get out of the hotel/conference center at least once during my week-long stay. I hadn't originally planned to leave the strip, but thanks to an Internet recommendation and after confirming with my Lyft driver that I wasn't going into a neighborhood where I'd be shot or mugged, I was on my way to find out what this place was about.  The staff was more than happy to help me figure out what would be the best bet based on my tastes, but I kind of ignored the advice and went with a #1 because it was the, \"original.\" Of course, I added their miso-glazed applewood smoked bacon, because bacon makes everything better. Their combo meals include garlic fries or their \"jazz\" fries and whatever drink you want, including a beer. I went with the garlic fries because I figured that after the burger, the jazz fries might be a bit heavy.  The burger was great! I actually totally devoured the thing much faster than I thought I would, but about halfway through I regretted not going with the #2 or #3 burgers as I was recommended. Not that the #1 was bad, but, as the staff indicated, it was a conservative Japanese twist on the traditional American cheeseburger. #2 and #3 get a bit more out there and I wish I would've been able to make it back for another try.  Also, crack sauce is crack.  The restaurant interior and overall vibe are super casual, kinda asian/manga, kind of video game heaven. Bright artwork everywhere, TVs on every wall showing anime, Family Guy, or \"watch me play\" sessions of video games. Very laid back, but service was incredibly quick.",

The best tasting of those were the fries and katsu, but I disagree with the brown gravy on the fries.  It doesn't work in my opinion.  I was really hungry, so I didn't snap a photo of my food.

I ordered the tamago burger meal, with the wasabi mayo on the side to dip my garlic fries in. I was a little thrown off by it, but they ask for a funny nickname to call out when your food is ready. Anyway, everything tasted so good! The patty was seasoned well, the egg wasn't too runny, and I loved the crispy onion strings. I think that by having a small menu, it really lets the restaurant focus on making burgers with ingredients that just mix so well together. I actually can't wait to go back and try some of their other items. Thankfully, too, they're open really late.   It may not have the biggest space, but there is ample parking, board games, 3 TV screens that play anime and gaming streams, as well as amazing artwork that adorn the walls all over the restaurant. Fuku Burger is for sure a good place for some late night eats.",

I got the original Fuku burger. It was good, but not as flavorful as other chain plaves such as Smash Burger. The fries were decent and well-seasoned. I thought the fuku sauce was great for fry-dipping. I like that I could order a can of Thai tea as my drink--thai iced tea is my favorite! The interior decor was very urban and artsy. They have a small featured artist gallery inside and board games avaialble to play. In my opinion, it was a little too overdone. The waitress and cashier were friendly. My biggest concern was that my burger was too rare. I didn't think I'd have to specify \"well done\" at a chain place like this, but if my boyfriend wants to go back, I will next time.",

Flavorful is an understatement with the entire burger roster, and we always order our usual Kinoko (all-beef medium-cooked patty with grilled shitake mushrooms, pickled red ginger, teriyaki, and drizzled with wasabi mayo), Karai (medium beef patty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and finished with habenero kabayaki) and a side of Jazz Fries (crispy garlic salt fries topped with brown gravy and Fuku's crack sauce). There was a time when Fuku Burger was hard to track down being that it started life as an agile food truck (and the truck saga still lives!), but all that changed when the Fukufam decided to create its homebase at the heart of Chinatown's food row. What didn't change is the great food!",

Their side of fries were well seasoned and goes well with the burgers. However, it's definitely not the star of the show.  The Karai \"spicy\" burger trumps everything on the menu. The beef itself was deliciously juicy and the shredded cabbage added a nice crunchiness to the burger. Even the pickles were good! And I'm usually indifferent about pickles. The habanero kabayaki adds a hint of spice, although I could go a bit spicier. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of that burger!  Foodwise, Fuku deserves five stars but loses one for me because of the long wait for the food to cook. I mean, if you're willing to wait, which after tasting their quality food I definitely am, by all means is this place a must while in Vegas. They also have some pretty fun board games and lots of TVs with nerdy channels playing to combat the wait time. Parking is also very ample for it is located next to a strip mall.   I will definitely be coming back (more than once) the next time I'm in Sin City as I am now a Fuku convert.",

Image the scene from the movie \"Half Baked\" where one employee conveys the order to the cook sitting 3 feet away via loud microphone- that just happened. I don't think this was coincidence.  My burger actually mirrored the picture in the menu (mouth watering). The photo attached to this review does not do it justice. Back to the cow I was indulging. It was as if it was alive but instead of blood- egg oozed out from each side. The teriyaki blended with the egg & fried onion was divine.   In a nutshell: delicious, unique, cheap. Trifecta!",

    "text": "Fuku Burger is probably one of my top 5 favorite burger places at this time.  The wife and I were yelping places to try while in Vegas and this one popped up because it was relatively close to our hotel, and it caught our attention immediately!  If you think the pictures of the food you are seeing look amazing, just wait until you actually take your first bite!  It is amazing.  Everything on the burger is done right, from the bun to the perfect sear of the patty, right down to the tasty sauces (holla' for that crack sauce!)  If I could, I would open up a Fuku Burger where I live.  I think this place would be insanely popular in Southern California, especially right next to UC Riverside in my hometown.  This place was so good, my wife and I ended up coming back here again during our vacation, and then we seriously considered coming back a 3rd time, but resisted the temptation.  My favorite burger was the Buta burger with bacon, cheese and pickled deliriousness on top (for real- pickled ginger was revolutionary!).  My wife's fave was the Tamago with a delicious egg and crispy onion straws on top for a classic delicious taste with the Fuku twist.  I don't want to seem like I'm begging, but I really want you to come to this place and try what I tried.  I promise you that you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "Well I see what all the Hype was all about and it's all True...I think this place has one of the best burgers in town, mind you I haven't been to a lot but I've had all the main ones...in &out, 5 guys, ass...I mean smash burger, steak and shake, basic( not even close to basic) and boca burger(overly priced burgers and overly pretension). The main difference here is their burgers are THICK not mushed up like all the rest, I didn't need to order a 3 by3 or 4 by 4 or blah-blah-blah, it was  juice which is what they're suppose to be. I didn't know you can ask on how to cook my burger but I got one a little more than medium which was fine.  I order the Tamago burger, the only thing I would say bad about it was the teriyaki sauce which sooo sweet and hid the burger meat flavor.  I got the combo meal with jazz fries and they were probably the best fries I've had in a long time. They came with just enough brown gravy and crack sauce. The crack sauce is awesome, I never tasted something soooo delicious before, my tongue was dancing uncontrollably, not like DJ Khaled's cause he don't go down on his woman...Lol. Maybe if he had some of this crack sauce he would. Fuku Burger's decor was very hipster Kool and Anime Chic, they had big screens showing anime and old classic Japanese cartoons and live action shows like ultra man and speed racer. They also featured art work by local artist. I notice they also had board games too. The place is not huge in the least but I went there at around 1-2pm on a Saturday so not too busy. There was a group of 6-7 people already sitting and 2 couples who just order ahead of me. I noticed the group were waiting for there food they didn't wait too long cause the cook started calling them to pick up their food, i wondered how long they waited and how long my food would take. But to my surprise I think my order came out faster than at in&out. One surprising thing was the cashiers who was also the buser and she asked us all if we wanted refills on our drinks which she brought back to us, I give her five star service for that. All in all I had a good experience at Fuku Burger and will came back again. I just wonder if I can custom make a burger.",

Next month will make it a year that we've been in Vegas and I can honestly say that this is the best burger I've had in town, or ever.   One might make the argument that typically I'm not even a burger person, but it's for a reason! I've been consistently dissapointed by the burgers I've experienced here- I even contemplated eating the tonkatsu burger instead (I'm sure it's probably delicious though) but instead took a risk with the burger and WOWIE WAS IT IMPRESSIVE! The flavors all worked amazing together, which wasn't suprising because we are both big fans of Asian food but the most amazing part of it all was the BURGER!!    Juicy juicy juicy and just with one bite you could tell the meat was quality- I COULD TASTE THE MEAT, I know it shouldn't be such an accomplishment but it's one of the hardest things to find here in Vegas. Service was fast and everyone was really friendly. The vibes were chill, the music was nice and the atmosphere is awesome. It was so fun in here, they have games, art, and funny anime up on the TVs- plenty of charging spots too! Gotta give props, they know just what we like.   A perfect lunch / dinner spot, I would recommend it over and over again, you'll love it.",

We got a Kinoko and Chicken Katsu burger as well as garlic fries and jazz fries. My chicken katsu was good flavor-wise, but the chicken had so much breading and was really tough. I tried a bit of the Kinoko burger and I think the flavor and concept are good, but the sauce had already soaked through the bottom of the bun when we got it. I didn't like the jazz fries - just not a lot of flavor. Definitely preferred the garlic fries as the togarashi makes for a nice kick.  The service didn't help. The girl taking our order kept talking to one of the other staff even while she was taking our order. She made me repeat my whole order three times and she still got it wrong. Just incredibly rude. She acted like getting a refill on my soda was such a big deal, too. Definitely did not make me feel like my business is appreciated.",

Had the basic Fuku-burger with the agarashi fries.  The burger was really juicy and cooked with bacon fat so pretty healthy and tasty!  The best part was the fries though.  Not really thin fries like In n Out but really crispy and hot - which was nice since it was slow.    They also make a vegetarian burger out of egg and some veggies.  Didn't really think that qualified as vegetarian but ah well, don't ask don't tell is the way to go.  Ha.  It's tasty too.  The place also had a pretty cool vibe with DragonballZ playing alongside Harry Potter and Transformers on four TV screens.  I like the Tokidoki style Comic book art too.

Im hoping they add new things to their menu. The chef and the young lady at the counter were very pleasant. We also got \"Tip Jelly\" lol Our nickname was \"Ali-Mish\". I love that they make the place fun! The paintings were really nice and it was cool that they had anime playing in the background on tvs. Cozy, relaxing place. Thank you!",

    "text": "I went to Fuku Burger on Spring Mountain and Jones. I had the Kinoko Burger , Jazz Fries and a soda. All six types of Asian fusion burgers are all priced at $7.99 the Jazz Fries were $3.99 And the soda (with free refill) was $2.10 Staff was friendly, there are about 8 sit down tables and plenty of parking. You have to give the person who is taking your order a Nickname for your order which they will call out when your order is ready , so be prepared. Mine was \"Squeaky\". It's all I could come up with. The burger was good but the star of the show was the Jazz Fries.  They are garlic fries with gravy and something they called \"crack sauce \" it was so good I ended up sopping up my burger in the left over fry sauce when I was done with the fries. If you don't want to try Asian fusion burgers , they offer one burger which looks pretty standard American style drizzled with Fuku Sauce... But the remaining five styles of Burger are DEFINATELY more Asian inspired. I can't say that the burger alone would bring me back here, but those fries would. Especially if I was in the area, I would stop by again .",

    "text": "I was so glad this location opened up since the one on the strip is a hassle to get to and I can never hunt down the truck. I was also happy to see that business wasn't too slow on the weekday night that we went for dinner. It's the perfect size. The music wasn't too loud either.  Food-wise, these burgers are the most juicy, greasy, delectable splurge that I can possibly get for those times I just want to ruin myself in the best possible way! They are a little expensive, but not so crazy that I could never stop by every now and then.   The fresh vegetables they have in some of the burgers do make me feel responsible for my health and balance it out though. I found the tamago burger was lovely in its sweetness but just too much protein/grease overall. The karai burger is a favorite if you like spicy and I've had the mushroom and original lucky burger which are both good. I'll try the rest once I get the craving back for a good burger!  Their fries and sauces on the fries, I'm not really crazy for, but it makes a nice complement to the meal overall.   When my burger was under cooked at my last visit they replaced it for me without any question and apologized. The replacement was cooked perfectly, not overdone or underdone, and hot and juicy! This moves me to give them 5 stars when its all said and done.   My only suggestion for the place would be to add subtitles/captions to the programs that are run on the televisions. Though I understand it could just simply be a part of the aesthetic decor to have colorful animations playing on the screens.",

Then today they didn't open at 11:30 because they were cooking for a catering event. We waited for 30 minutes to open the door. If you can't open on time, just change your hours so we don't waste our lunch break. Only saving grace is good food.",

My boyfriend and I left really disappointed, especially after spending $30 here (2 burgers, fries, and a drink). Definitely not worth the money. It took forever to get our food, and when we did get it, my burger came out wet and soggy? Literally there was water at the bottom of my plate and it was just so unappetizing I couldn't get past three bites (coming from someone who doesn't lose their appetite easily). On top of that, the cashier who was taking my order was giving me dirty looks when I was nothing but polite. Not really sure how I offended her but ok.....   Bottom line - I don't get annoyed easily but this place is the one exception. Please don't waste your hard earned cash here when there are about a billion other burger joints in this town. So not worth it!!!!!",

They say that the combo saves $2.00, and when a small drink costs $2.55, that's not the bargain it might seem.  My chicken seemed to be slightly overcooked, and the advertised katsu sauce was not the type to which I am accustomed.  That being said. It was still tasty.  The fries were excellent, well cooked and seasoned.  So, why 4* when my sandwich was just good, not great?  Well, several things.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  The decor was very cool.  Heck, having Ultraman on the ceiling is virtually worth 1* by itself.  They have WiFi.  And, I'll definitely go back again.  We'll see if the rating changes at that point.",

    "text": "When I'm in Vegas, I will get an inexplicable craving for a really good burger. It probably has to do with the fact that I've had so many bad steak experiences in high end places. Maybe it's just a bang for the buck thing. If a burger's disappointing, I'll only be out $10-$15 tops, right?  So, we start searching the web for the best burger joints in Vegas, and a lot of them that come up are kinda sketchy or, are exactly the same options I have in SoCal. Fukuburger had some decent reviews, and it looked like it'd offer up something different.  It seems like most of the stuff that would make this place stand out in terms of flavor profile just sort of get lost in the shuffle. To me, furikake adds less to the flavor of something dense and meaty like a burger patty than adding black pepper would. It just doesn't have a strong enough flavor. My tamago burger was prepared well, but it was just a standard \"fried egg on a burger\" burger. The buns may as well have come from a giant Wonder bread bakery, (I mean seriously, look at the pictures on their website. Is that not the exact same cafeteria burger bun you remember from elementary school?) and honestly, I didn't even remember that the burger had teriyaki sauce on it until I went back and checked the menu.  Service was fine, the TVs playing youtube playlists of Power Rangers and Naruto were an interesting and unique touch, and the fries were good, and fried well. All in all, this just seems like an average joint to me. It's fine, but I'm not going out of my way to eat here. If I came back, I'd probably get the FukuMoco and the Disco fries, but my quest to find a Vegas spot that has a really good burger is still ongoing.",

I had the kinoko burger, and am still undecided on this one I enjoy mushroom burgers, but not sure if the shitake mushrooms are better than a good mushroom swiss burger!  It was decent, I liked the amount of pickled red ginger on it as well. Not too much, just enough to accent the burger.  will be back for a visit again soon, definitely worth it, especially since the location doesn't require an awful visit to the Hawaiian marketplace! enough said!!!!",

It seems to be a good location for what they are. I was surprised to find out they have a loyalty card. It's a really cool idea to keep people coming back. I also like that they send out random text about offers or discounts on combos. The space is small but cool. They have some really dope art hanging and it they are for purchase. They have random movies/shows playing on the tv and even games you can grab and play. I like that they make it comfy. They also do the funny name thing like they do with the truck. I really like it. It gets people laughing and in a good mood. I just wish the Ronald McFuku was always on the menu. It's so bomb and delicious and donut yummm. Overall been a couple time and still impressed. They are always friendly and quick to help. I need to actually take advantage of the beer specials they have late night sometime. Nice job Fuku!",

Well, I'm happy to say Fukuburger doesn't disappoint and I will go so far as to say this is the best burger in Vegas!  As a big burger fan, I've tried most of the well known burgers offered in town, Umami, Holstein's, Shake Shack and Ramseys, etc.  For the price, I think this is the best by far.  The beef, the cheese, all of the ingredients play together perfectly and really make for an incredible dining experience.    Since this was my first visit, I had the base model Fukuburger and agarashi fries.  Both were top of the line.  The beef is perfection, locally sourced, marinated and cooked with bacon fat while the other ingredient are super high quality including the wasabi mayo and Fuku sauce .   The spot is really cool and the staff is hip by the way but go for the food.  You won't regret it.",

    "text": "All right burger lovers if you're looking for the best hamburger in Las Vegas then this is the place for you. Seriously this place has set the bar for hamburgers all across the country. I have had  everything on the menu and my favorite hamburger by far is the #2 Tamago Burger. I have had it at least 50 times and can tell you I'm nowhere even close to being tired of it. I'm here now with the menu in front of me and this is what's in it. All-beef Fuku patty topped with a fried runny egg, furikake, crispy onion strings, and finished with teriyaki and wasabi mayo. It's amazing. Secondly are the Jazz fries let me tell you there are nothing short of amazing order them extra extra crispy with extra crack sauce and you will be hooked. Whether you're visiting from out of state or you're local you have to stop by and try this place. Lastly for all the night owls it's open late especially on Friday and Saturday, ok people that's all for now I'm out of here",

I like to look at the cleanliness and the customer service as well as the food by appearance and taste.  To start, the restaurant was very clean when we walked in the music was a little bit loud but that's bearable. The customer service was average, with the cashier being friendly and smiling.     My husband and I each ordered a hamburger and garlic fries to share. I don't remember the names of the burgers but he had the one with the egg on it and I had the one with the mushrooms and teriyaki.  We each agreed that the flavor of our burgers was exceptional my husband noted that next time he might get one Patty instead of two so that he can enjoy the proper balance of flavors. I noted that the shiitake mushrooms were very rubbery on my burger and that texture was not appealing to me.    Overall they were good burgers with a great marriage or flavors and OK customer service in a clean environment.",

The last time we wanted a delicious burger, we polled our friends and went to Bachi Burger (also ridiculously delicious) and this time around, the survey returned Fuku Burger.  I got the Fuku burger and my BF got the Buta burger. Although my burger was really well done, it will still super delicious. I couldn't finish it, because I was very much into the jazz fries I got on the side but he finished mine. His burger was cooked to more of a pink, my preferred level of doneness on a burger, but as I said, mine was still good. I liked the fun decor and it was cute when the cashier asked us to give a funny name to call when our order was ready. We used our celebrity power couple name (haha)!  The only reason I am not giving five stars is that I feel like all together our meal was pretty expensive for two burgers, fries, and two beers; our total was $35 and change. Of course, if we hadn't ordered alcohol it would have been significantly cheaper, but I just felt that $35 was a little steep for this style of dining. BUT it was very satisfying and we will definitely be back.",

I do wish that they ask how you like your burger patties cooked, cause I always get mines medium rare.  The burger has good flavor, but overall, its too dry. Needs a lot more sauce. The burger was tasty, but not amazing.  Fries were okay as well. Slightly thicker cut with some slight seasoning. The mayo like dipping sauce was a nice touch.  P.S.

I wish Fuku burger comes with pickled red ginger because the ginger gave a bit different, kinda refreshing taste on the burger.  Well, I admit I was misunderstood that Fuku burger too with pickled red ginger. Oh, I was a bit uncomfortable as I could not find price of the menu.   I understand the burger basket liner with many Japanese F-words is fashionable, funky and fun. Still, it is a bit surprising as a Native.",

    "text": "Fuku has been a local food truck favorite- and I've enjoyed their food. One of the perks to their new brick in mortar location (besides being convenient to me!) is that their food quality is consistent and their service has improved. The location also offers free wifi, as well as fun music and videos playing for entertainment while you wait.  While their Buta Burger is still my favorite- always juicy, plenty of flavor!- the Naga dog is also a solid option. However, a flaw I've noticed with both is the bread. The burger buns are bulk-purchase and don't stand out, and tend to fall apart. I'd prefer a sturdier version (maybe an onion bun?), the King's Hawaiian buns would be a really great option, especially for the hotdog.  I'm a little disappointed to see that the pricing is still a bit high- $8 for a burger is fair, adding $5 for a drink and fries is steep, and $9 for the (admittedly generously-sized) Naga dog is higher than several local specialty hotdog spots price theirs. I guess I expect slightly inflated pricing for food trucks, but to see the same prices here as at their Strip location was unexpected.",

I ordered the #5 KARAI (All-beef Fukupatty with pickled cucumbers, avocado cream, and finished with habenero kabayaki).  It was amazing!!  They are generous with their cream sauce.  The burger melted in my mouth. The meat tasted really fresh too. Definitely get extra napkins!  My friend and I split the decadent jazz fries, and couldn't even finish them.  The fries were addictive like crack!  Wow!    It's their crack sauce that just makes everything better!  I think it's a mix of that Japanese mayo and sweet and sour sauce. Plus probably another ingredient or two. Wow, what a combo!",

    "text": "My favorite Japanese-American burger joint in Vegas! I've tried all 6 combos on their menu and I can say the Chicken Katsu Burger is #1 (maybe it's the crack sauce?)  Quality: The burgers are cooked and prepared nicely along with a choice of Garlic or Jazz Fries for the side. (I suggest having napkins handy). I've not once had a burger looked sloppy or tasted under cooked.  Service: I usually stop by to eat during lunch or evening hours as service is quick and not too long of a wait. It's great to see they just started a rewards program for dining in recently but I didn't get offered that on my last dine in. (I'm not sure if they stopped?)  Pricing: I would say you do get what you pay for and that is the quality of food that is being served. Usually it's about $14 for a combo after taxes. It is a small business and they do have to make a profit versus a franchise.  You'll leave here with a smile, a full stomach and some left overs to take home with you.",

Their fuku fries to me have always been over hyped but the jazz fries are better so go for that.   Place is small so large groups will struggle and parking is a bit odd since it shares with an Asian grocery story and strip mall. Still roomy so parking won't kill you and it's free.

We sat at the bar by the windows, lots of charging outlets there for those than need to refuel their electronics as well as their belly.  The Thai Tea is tasty, but it is a deceptively heavy drink that will fill you fast. The burgers were ready in about 5 minutes. When they called our funny name we grabbed them and dove in. Soooo good. Cooked perfectly on a soft bun, with a perfect compliment of toppings. Asian fusion burgers can often be overbearing on the flavors, these were a beautiful balance that other burger places only dream of achieving. I had the Kinoko and the mushrooms were delicious!  I am looking forward to getting back, I have so many burgers left to try. I'm going spicy next time!",

Food was rich full of flavor, and the burger patty was notably a fusion of Japanese flavors. Coming back to Vegas this year.. I decided to hunt them down again, unaware that they now have two physical locations.   Well, truck hunting was obviously unneeded at that point, and Chinatown was not a far drive away.. thus, it was going to be an easy trip to satisfy my long wanted craving of having Fuku again. After inhaling my Karai burger and Jazz fries... my belly was happy and much smiles were had. It was nice to have their food again after so many years.  It's good to know they've grown and that their food can leave a lasting impression enough for someone like myself to remember to seek them out when I'm in town. Wonderful all around!",

    "text": "I wasn't much of a fan a few years ago when they were just a food truck. I was skeptical about coming to their brick and mortar location but my friends were visiting from New Jersey, they were in the mood for burgers and figured to get them something that's unique to Las Vegas.  I am surprised that the burger was much larger than before and the fries were hot and crispy. I really enjoyed the food here. Either my taste buds have changed or they've upped their game. My friends from New Jersey loved this place so much, they came back one more time before flying back.  The staff here is friendly and the decor is fun and engaging. If you're visiting Las Vegas and looking for something local, this is a good spot. If you're local and want to try a new type of burger and tired of the same ole In and Out, give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!",

Walked in and it's like a anime/comic book theme, pretty neat.   Jenny took our order, she was very pleasant, I enjoyed how she was able to answer questions pretty honestly. After the order is taken you're asked for a nickname for them to call when you're order is ready. I liked this because it creates a lively environment hearing the names people give. Also if you leave a tip they yell \"tip jelly!\" And give you a little jelly straw thing. Again super cute.   I ordered the katsu, a chicken sandwich, pretty good. My friend ordered the tamago, has a friend egg on it. Was a little over cooked but Jenny while doing her rounds came over and asked how everything was, when she was told it was cooked a little extra she insisted we remake whatever needed to be remade.   I was so impressed when this young lady did this. Thank you so much Jenny!",

    "text": "Fuku Burger has been on my radar for quite some time. Today is the day I act upon indulging here.  The reviews from prior individuals and past experiences made me want to eat here. The Fuku menu is the simplest piece of literature that I have ever encountered. Plus it comes color coded for authenticity.  First off I wanted to give my taste buds a ride Fuku style. Saving my appetite all day for this moment, the order went as this:  Had the number 1 Fuku Lucky Burger. I am not a fan of onion or tomato so opted to withhold these. It left this burger with the meat, cheese, and Fuku sauce. The meat is flavored with a balance of spices that give it a kick. The burger is moist and is held between a fresh, heated, bun that fits perfectly in ones hand.   Exploring the menu more I had the number 2, which is the Tamago Egg Burger. Again I had the onion strings withheld. This meat patty was the same amazing quality as the first one, but comes with no cheese. It does however have a fried egg. The egg was cooked perfectly. The yolk broke over the hamburger patty provided more moistness and delicious flavor to the burger in that same bun as the number 1.  The Fuku sauce is sweet like a sweet and sour sauce . It is not hot at all and gives the burger a rich sweetness glaze fire flavor mix.  The number two has a sweet taste since teriyaki sauce is lightly drizzled over it. The Furikake and wasabi mayo that are mixed together in the bun with the egg give the burger an edgy and rich flavor.   Out of the two burger I would recommend the Number 2 \"Egg Burger\" it's edgy taste fill the old factory senses but do not set them on fire. It's a delicate balance of sauces that mesh nicely together.   There are no sides to the burgers but one can make it a combo and save $2. The garlic fries sounded the best so making one a combo brought down the cost of the burgers. The restaurant serves alcohol mostly beer. Beer and burgers are always a win win. The soda fountains are Pepsi products on tap.   The service here is impeccable and amazing. The cook is a genuine marvel. The time between when the order is placed to the table is less than ten minutes. The food is cooked to order as well.   The decor of the restaurant is fun fabulous, since there are four televisions all going with different channels. The closed caption is on if you want to watch and read the words. They offers board games in a wide selection such as family favorites like Monopoly or Jenga.  Now should you eat here of course, if you have schedule conflicts the staff here takes care of that by being open to 3 am Friday and Saturday. Sunday to Thursday they can Fuku you till 1 am.",

    "text": "Fuku Burger is a fine establishment. With a fun Japanese anime type ish atmosphere friendly staff and good food. What really impresses me though is that they stand by their product and they listen to their customers which is a breath of fresh air in today's society. When I had a problem with my order I was contacted shortly thereafter by the manager who went out of their way to make it right. Which shows a lot of respect for the customers and deep pride in their work that is rare nowadays. The only caveat that I can say about them now is that if you get their Jazz fries to go you need to specify that you want the gravy and the sauce on the fries otherwise they will give you the gravy in the sauce separate. This was a problem for me the first time however after having been explained the context as to why they do that it makes more sense. They explained to me that they had gotten complaints that the gravy in the sauce made the fries too soggy which I can understand. So if that's your biggest concern then I wouldn't mention anything otherwise if you want the gravy and a sauce to be on the fries on a to-go order you would need to tell them which is not too much of an imposition as they are happy to make any reasonable changes to your order. Overall though it was a very nice experience. I like the fact they take responsibility and the day show respect and care for their customers. Initially I had thought their prices were a bit High but given the customer care that you receive at this place I'd say it's pretty fair I think it's safe to assume I will be returning in the future at some point in time as I already did like this place due to its fun atmosphere and friendly staff even before they showed how much they care for their customers.",

The hamburgers were out of this WORLD!!!!  In and Out is a basic staple of a good burger, and we thought Bachi Burger was good, but this is above and beyond.  I had the Buta Burger, which is a burger with bacon.  The hamburger was so moist and they topped it off with red ginger which made the burger unbelievable. The french fries are sprinkled with togarashi red pepper.  Everytime we go to Las Veags, this will be a \"for sure\" stop on our list of places to eat.",

I had always wanted to visit this place, I was hyped up because of seeing them on TV and seeing them list themselves as Vegas's best burger.  I had higher expectations and was disappointed.  I want to be clear, nothing was WRONG with my sandwich, it just lacked flavor (to me).  I don't think I'll go back to try anything else there are sooooo many burger places to choose from I'll find one. The girl at the counter was SUPER helpful and that was nice too.",

Its got cool artwork on the interior, with an easy to read digital menu, but the dining space kinda is cramped.  We shared a Fukuburger with Jazz Fries, and luckily we just ordered one burger to test it out. Everything sounds and looks great, but the taste and composition of our items just didn't impress me...not a fan of whatever additional seasoning/marinade is used in the patty, and the patty has an odd firm texture to it. The bun is supposed to keep everything in between in tact, but liquid from the patty and additional ingredients were soaked up from the bottom, and it was a soggy mess. Jazz Fries were not all that jazzy...more like a generic poutine without the cheese curds and mayo instead. Um....no.  Fukuburger already has a loyal following, so I wish them nothing but the best...maybe the timing of my visit wasn't good (Team Fukuburger was catering at an Atlanta Falcons game in the ATL) so maybe quality and cosistency slipped a bit, who knows? I just hope that this place isn't jinxed from formerly being White Rabbit, and Fresh Cup before that.  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  2",

    "text": "There seems to be a bit of a hate train rolling through this reviews section. While I'd agree that criticism is somewhat warranted, I still see more positives than negatives.  Fukuburger has long been one of my favorite Las Vegas food trucks, and this third shot at brick-and-mortar success is their first positioned outside of the Strip. They've taken over the former location of Fresh Cup and most recently White Rabbit. Customer traffic was steady if somewhat slow at around dinner time on a surprisingly nippy Monday night.  The menu is mostly the same as the truck's menu, although I'm not sure how often they carried all of those fries options. They also seem to offer specials every so often, as seen on their Instagram, but tonight's Kennedy didn't sound that exciting to me. The employee described it as a Katsu Burger (chicken) with mac and cheese inside. I'll try to come back when they're serving up something more intriguing.  I went for the Kinoko (Mushroom) Burger, a somewhat ill-advised choice in hindsight. I hadn't had the Tamago (Egg) Burger that recently, but I went instead with a different burger that I'd previously experienced. That said, I don't remember the mushrooms being so tough to chew. Mushrooms in burgers need to be tender, period, and these were thick but not easy to bite through.  Let's get back to the basics though. The bun was solid and held up to the onslaught of sauces both inside and out. The beef patty was a gigantic oversized portion that met the challenge of the $8 price in a brick-and-mortar context (food trucks are generally overpriced, believe it or not). It was cooked to medium, although it did seem slightly underseasoned and boring in and of itself. But you're not getting these burgers because you're a purist anyway, and the pickled ginger, teriyaki sauce, and wasabi mayo make it an enjoyable burger overall.  Also, the $4 jazz fries (served on the same tray as the burger) were pretty dynamite. While there isn't any sort of cheese in here, I'm pretty sure they're better seasoned overall than the poutine that I tried at a certain shop not too long ago. The fries were crunchy, the brown gravy was hot and rich, and the crack sauce was some mildly addictive mayo-based goodness.  The dining area is fairly small, as fans of the former inhabitants White Rabbit and Fresh Cup may know. However, they go above and beyond by offering free Wi-Fi for all, as well as power strips at the high counters for charging your devices.   Even though I'd eaten not long before this Fukuburger visit, I definitely enjoyed my meal. Despite my own doubts, they've transitioned their truck's menu into a casual burger experience that has its own niche among other similarly priced casual burger joints. Just remember to have a funny nickname ready because they've kept that aspect of the Fukuburger truck too.",

Once you sink your teeth into one of  these burgers, everything leaves your mind as the flavors explode in your mouth.  Yeah we've been to all the superstar chef burger joints and yes they are very very good except for Guy's burger place...but I seriously believe Fuku takes first place in burgers for all of Las Vegas.  They have a food truck too so check out where it might be while visiting Las Vegas.     Don't forget the fries...again they hit it out of the park.  Crack sauce?!  That is a very appropriate name.  Once you taste this, your hooked and crave more instantly.  This is one of these places it is so hard to describe because everything was so good.  The staff were very friendly, were eager to meet your needs and seemed very satisfied at doing so.  Great people there!     MANGA!!  I cannot wait to visit Las Vegas again to go to Fuku!",

Vacant tables were not clean but again they were busy. Games available for you to play while you wait.... I thought that was cute. The food was good. Our favorite was the jazz fries. Burger was fine but not great. Fried Chicken sandwich was good. They have a couple of good craft beer choices... I liked that. All in all, glad we had the experience but won't be running back anytime soon.",

    "text": "Fuku otakus!   Having just arrived in Las Vegas with no plans on where to go to lunch, I took a quick peek at my bookmarks and saw this place. Did I want some kawaii and colorful food? Ya darn right I do!  We ordered a Fuku Burger, Naga Dog, Jazz Fries, and two drinks. With tip, it came out to be around $30. Not bad for a lunch for two. The #1 Fuku Burger is an all-beef \"Fukupatty\" with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and topped with wasabi mayo and Fuku sauce. It was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. I mainly had the Naga Dog which is a 1/3lb. hot link topped with grilled kimchi, daikon relish, wasabi mayo, spicy kabayaki sauce, and topped harinori strips. Minus the kimchi being in huge awkward slices [I think I would have preferred it to be chopped up], it was really good! All the buns for the burger and the hot dog were toasted so props! As for the Jazz Fries, don't skip on these! They're crispy garlic salt fries topped with brown gravy and crack sauce. It's like a poutine but without cheese.   Our server was Sophonary and she was super nice! The place is clean, there was Overwatch AND Dragon Ball Z on tv, the artwork is cool, and the food is good and looks like it came out of an anime. So what are you waiting for? Fuku! That was a darn good burger and hot dog!",

Ordered the number #2 with a fried egg with jazz fries and ordered the number 5, which came with habanero sauce.  For drink we decided to try the Thai tea.  They ask for a goofy name when they call your order so be prepared to be a little creative.   The number #2 was cooked to perfection at medium, the meat taste like it is marinade in hoisin or some kind of sweet Asian concoction.  The fried egg on top complimented the burger nicely sweet juicy and savory.  The #5 also has a little sweetness, but than you get the kick of the habanero along with the fried onions that go so nicely with the burger.  The jazz fries where great never had anything like them, they look like a poutine but the gravy is quite sweet probably the same sauce they use on the burgers reminded me of the sweet sauce you would get in a eel roll.  The dipping sauce comes with standard ketchup, siracha, and a spicy mayo.  All were fairly good, if, I lived here would frequent quite often.",

The 1st time I had it was at the Buffalo location and that Burger was delicious. For this meal we were not disappointed everything we had was awesome.  For a second time I order the Buta Burger that comes with bacon and you get the option for a dollars the fries they put gravy and their secret sauce  oh my gosh it is so good. The burger was cooked thoroughly and oh my gosh so tender.    The restaurant was really clean and kept very well.  When we got there it was crowded but I mean we did get there around dinner time but we were able to grab a table and eat.   They decked out the whole restaurant with a bunch of anime and Marvel stuff which was really cool I liked that admiring all the stuff on the walls.   The staff was super friendly and the help this out and answered all of my friends questions when it came to the menu. Next time I go there they sell stickers I'm definitely gonna grab one they only cost a dollar. But absolutely up definitely coming back to this place. Definitely without a doubt the best Burger in Las Vegas!!",

The pickled ginger and the teriyake sauce is dripping awesomeness!  I never had both flavors on a burger but it works so well!  My 2nd favorite is the Naga Dog.  Its spicy and I love the kimchee in there.  For french fries get the Jazz Fries with the gravy and crack sauce.  I didnt but next time Im asking for extra gravy. The perfect flavors and uniqueness is why it deserves the extra star.  Place:  We went to the Chinatown location.  Its kinda small.  Looks like a former taco bell.  But its kept very clean!    Service:  The counter girl was very friendly and patient as we were new to this place.  The owner also talked to us. We are from Houston and he said they catered and had a food truck in Htown during the Super Bowl.  I live in Katy TX west of Houston and this guy would make a killing down here in Katy Asian Town!  Very friendly guy!  Value:  Every sandwich was about $8.  Super great deal!  Hard to beat!  Recommendation:  just GO!",

It was amazing; perfect balance between sweet and savory with a kick of spicy. I had with the togarashi fries and their sauces just complimented everything.

You order at the counter, they give you your drink, and then you sit and wait for them to call your name.  The person taking my order was quite friendly.  The wait at the table was not very long.  Make sure you get plastic ware from the counter area so you have for eating.  There is a napkin dispenser on each table.  My favorite part of the meal were the jazz fries.  It's like getting poutine without the cheese curds--I know my Canadian friends--that's not poutine, eh?  The burger, on the other hand, was a letdown from my expectations.  It was cooked well done--the cow died--and there was little to no juice from the burger.  If it was smaller in diameter and thicker, the Knights could have used it for a puck.  The burger gets its juice from what they put on it.  The menu says:  All-beef Fukupatty topped with a fried runny egg, furikake, crispy onion strings, and finished with teriyaki and wasabi mayo.  You will need napkins but it won't be from juicy beef, it will be from the egg and mayos.  I judge the meal as OK not A-OK as the Yelp three stars indicates.  I doubt I'll garner any points in their frequent diner program.",

The asian fusion take on the burgers also adds to the burger without taking away from the basic taste and concept of what a burger is. I enjoyed getting the classic, but even having the pickled onions on top of the burger rather than raw onions changed the taste of the burger to make it a unique dining experience. Fuku Burger was a staple for me when I lived in Las Vegas. The atmosphere of the restaurant is also very cool and inviting. All the cashiers and employees were always friendly. Can't recommend this place enough, its better than any other burger place!",

I am gluten free so it was without bun and was supposed to be a lettuce wrap but basically it was placed between 2 pieces of lettuce. Being that the toppings are all cold my burger actually didn't taste that hot and I was left with a pile Of liquids under my burger.  My children say that they were not as happy this time either. Bummer!  The interior is clean and the staff is friendly so that makes up for the subpar food.",

That doesn't mean I loathe this place but I was iffy about coming back.   Oh man, the Jazz fries are too good to pass up though. The crack sauce on top is something else.  My feelings about the burgers have positively changed because I actually tried something else. As of recent, I've had the Buta (pork) Burger and the Katsu Burger. Both are great options and they seriously hit the spot. They're a nice size as well. Oh and if you ever dip your burger into the crack sauce, tastes even better.  The employees are so friendly and there's a female employee who has long, blonde hair. She is absolutely nice and always makes my visits worthwhile.  If you do tip, they all shout \"Tip jelly!\" and you get a jelly stick for free. It's so cute!  The food comes out quick along with the funny name they ask you for.  Fuku Burger is such a solid place and I'm glad I gave them another go.",

    "text": "Going in, you know that Tamago Burger's gonna be messy because it's a teriyaki sauce laden, fried egg topped patty with furikake. Then onion strings are heaped onto the egg and Fuku sauce is drizzled thereon.  In concept the mix of ingredients sound good. But in execution, it wasn't.  I couldn't taste the furikake. The teriyaki sauce was insipid. The onion strings get soggy quickly from the Fuku sauce and the texture wasn't working for me. But all in all, anything topped with a fried egg increases elevation. French fries were decent. Sprinkled with zingy flavor.  Sean thought the wait time was long but I didn't think it was any longer than, at say, Teddy's. There were 4 parties ahead of us ordering at the counter but I thought the line moved pretty quickly.  The decor is manga anime and would appeal mostly to gamers, who were represented well in a group of six. There were a few singles and couples, as well as another group of six in two families enjoying an after-Church lunch.  Prices are reasonable, with any burger at $8, a soda at $2 and $3 for fries. But as a combo, it's only $11 total.  This location is in a strip mall but is in a free-standing building with easy access and plentiful parking.  Young woman at counter was friendly and helpful.  I would go back to try other burgers, or a hot dog.",

I had #4 bacon burger which was delicious, but next time I will tell them to hold the BBQ sauce or put it on the side. We went with the crack sauce fries and they were good.

Nope, my eyes were set on the Chicken sandwich combo with garlic fries.  She asked for a funny name to be called when order was ready . I said Joe.  She said come on, I need a funny name.  I replied okay , Joe Momma. I like the fun chill atmosphere there. They have peer pong and some other board games you can play and a happy hour on Asahi Beer but I didn't get the details. When they called Joe Momma I retrieved my meal and it was delicious . Panko crusted chicken probably 8 oz with a cabbage and sauce topping.  Garlic fries  needs more garlic just my preference . $12 for the combo & soda ..well worth it. Will return and recommend",

I liked the panko breading but the chicken wasn't what im accustomed to in a restaurant. It was a huge portion though. Also had the Naga dog which was super spicy. Good, but spicy. Had the buta burger which was good but could have used more sauce. Patty was well done and would have preferred medium. Had the jazz fries and loved the gravy and crack sauce. Not too keen on the bbq sauce that was on it as well. Wife had the tamayo burger which was really good and liked the egg.  Came with the garlic fries which had almost no seasoning on them. Son had the lucky burger and loved it. Fun atmosphere playing quality 90s and early 2000s hip hop. Nice option to eat out with the family.",

I've been throwing up every few hours it's currently 3am and can't keep anything but water down. I knew something was off with that breaded chicken. I shouldn't of ate here. The worst mistake ever. I knew this gave me food poisoning because all I had for breakfast was toast peanut butter. And my throw up showed me what was wrong.... let me tell you it was chicken chunks and pieces of fries.

This burger had fried onion strings, furikake (Japanese rice seasoning), pickled ginger, fried egg, and wasabi mayo. I thought the wasabi would be spicy, but I couldn't even taste it--it was one cohesive delicious flavor. Not spicy at all--which is good. The buns were soft, toasted on the edges, delicious and really kept the burger together. I've had other Japanese burgers before (Bachi Burger) and i can't say one is better than the other--they are different. Bachi uses more sauce and toppings--definitely a two hand, sit down burger (poss knife & fork). Fuku packs more flavor into the meat, so it's less messy, but still flavorful. You could eat a Fuku burger with one hand. The jazz fries with crack sauce and gravy were delicious, too!",

I had the Chicken Katsu burger meal.  The chicken katsu was breaded just right, but the garlic fries didn't taste very \"garlicy\" to me.  They tasted like regular fries.

I wasn't expecting to pay $13 for a combo...to me that was way over priced for the quality of food. Also on the menu it says 7.99 make it a combo and save $2.00 which is mis leading and leads you to believe you're going to pay 7.99 for a combo not $13...My order was correct and my food wasn't bad just not worth the money. I am not sure I would suggest this place to friends...for the price they should go to Bachi Burger. Also the menu needs to be revised and more clear on pricing because basically I paid $8 for my fries and small drink while my burger was $5...not cool at all.",

The girl who took our orders seemed very lazy, and even though there was no one else to serve, she didn't bother cleaning up the dirty tables and ice and some water on the floor that someone could slip on. The wait for our food was a little better, there were some board games that we could play to pass the time. Unfortunately, when our food arrived, we went to wash our hands in one of the worst bathrooms I have seen. The paper towel dispenser was either broken and empty, and the air dryer didn't work either. The floors were flooded with dirty water. The food itself tasted good, but it was very messy. We got the pork (buta) burger, the egg (tamago) burger, the mushroom burger (which I forgot the other name of), and the Jazz fries. The pork burger tasted nice, meaty. The egg burger was good, the egg made the bun soggy though. The mushroom burger was burnt, but still rather flavorful. I especially liked the Jazz fries, though I think that they would've been better without the gravy. The decorations were cartoon and anime inspired, and they gave off groovy vibes. Those groovy vibes, however, were not enough to make up for the unpleasant aura radiating from the rest of the place. I give fuku burger three stars and a disappointed look.",

From the time of my order to the time I got my food was over 40 minutes - hard to accept on a one hour lunch break, especially given their limited menu. I ordered the Mushroom Burger - the mushrooms were rubbery - and the burger had the taste of old grease - like the grill wasn't properly cleaned and seasoned. The garlic fries were limp and really didn't have much of a taste other than maybe a little garlic salt/powder. The cost was $11.99. I expected a fresh and tasty burger with crispy garlic fries. I got neither. I can go to Carl's Jr and get the same quality burger and fries for 2-3 bucks less - and much faster. Very disappointing.",

My bf and I went to the actual restaurant today and again the food was not as good as the first time I had it, but it wasn't horrible either.    My bf got the tomago and it was good but not worth the $$.  I got the katsu and it literally had 3 chicken patties on it so that one seemed like it was worth what I was paying but there was barely any crack sauce on it and not a lot of cabbage either for the amount of meat!   The garlic fries were good at the beginning but by the time we were eating the last ones they were pretty crunchy and dry.   The crack sauce was also rly lacking flavor today!   Lastly, this doesn't have to do with the food but we overheard and saw, who we assumed to be the manager get really upset with a chef and was yelling at him.. don't get me wrong we understand if ur worker screws up its ok to say something but be aware of the fact the kitchen is open to the entire restaurant, and that doesn't look good for u or the restaurant!",

I hate mayo or thousand island dressings on my burgers. That whole furake business is over rated according to me BUT others love the flavor. You just have To try it. To me it's nothing more than seasoning on fried chicken breast usually. Had it when I visited Hawaii. The better half said I HAD to try it. Yeah I did and that's it. It's sort of like Carl's Jr and that damn secret sauce. The secret is they they just use Thousand Island. Ta da. If you order a combo it gets pricey. You can prob go to In N Out and get the same quality burger for half the price. But if you are tired of the regular chain burger joints, support your local burger joint. Support these guys. I know they work hard even if I am not really a big fan of their burgers. But if I am buying groceries next door, I stop by once in a while. The Taiwan restaurant across is not bad either but sometimes you just want a dang greasy burger.",

The food was ok, not worth the hype, the burger was under cooked & the prices are too steep for the qualities food they put out. The wait time was insane as well.

The fuku burger didn't wow me as I expected it too only because of all my buddies hyping the place. Maybe it was the choice of burger? I'm hoping to come back and try other menu items because for some odd reason the smell of the joint kinda got me hooked. The Garlic fries were the right amount of chunky and crisp. I love how they packaged the sauces.  Appearance wise A+++++++ love the art that was plastered around the place. I was on a time crunch so I had my food to go. I wanted to appreciate the more of it. They had a couple of wall flat screen TVs some played anime and I think another played a Kpop music video. It was very versatile.   Customer service was good. The cute girl at the counter reminded me of an anime character who's sweet, reserved, & just fast paced. No time to waste. I literally watched her take 5 orders in under 4 min I really don't know why I'm so impressed by that.  All in all my opinion will most likely change when I order a different and unique burger. But it was good! Will be coming back",

I went a different route, had the deep fried panko coated chicken sandwich which was a huge perfectly fried sandwich.

    "text": "When you add crack to the name of a sauce, that is what you get exactly. Whether you're dipping it on your garlic fries or even on your burger this stuff is legit.  Size and seating : fairly small for your quick grab and go, but also can seat 15-20 pls max.   Restaurant atmosphere: low key, with some art of Audrey Kawasaki and tv that features anime to Cartoon Network.  Food: the tamago: if you're looking for a burger that changes the game on what a burger should be then this is the way to go. Not only is your meat juicy, it's it constantly hydrated with a sunny side up egg that is just an amazing combination to this burger. The onions and the wasabi sauce are not too over baring and compliment each other really well.   Garlic fries: over all good mixture and seasoning on the fries. Potatoes were fried just enough to have that crispy initial bite while getting an elegant rush of salty, garlic and furikake. I suggest having this with the crack sauce to help mellow out the salty bits.   Conclusion: only reason I didn't fulfill all 5 stars was it's cleanliness. But in terms of food and taste it definitely hits the spot.",

The egg was cooked so that once you grasped the bun, the yolk split open. Perfect! The fries were delicious but got soggy after sitting in all the sauce for too long, so eat them fast it you want them crispy. The hot dog was pretty good too, had some kick to it. The bbq burger was good, but not something I will probably get again as the egg burger was much tastier. Overall the place was clean, fun, and food was delicious.",

    "text": "May 26, 2016 @ 3:56 PM.  This restaurant is owned by a Virginia high school classmate of mine, Colin, class of 1989.  Go RAMS!  I had been threatening to visit him at his food truck for the past ten years every time I visited Vegas, but it never happened.  Finally, on this visit the family and I made it there, ate his food, but he wasn't there.  Well, maybe next time.  The decor was casual, and they had a good selection of board games and puzzles to play if you are in the mood.  I enjoyed the posters and paintings on the walls including some anime and some local street artists.  It is in the Chinatown section of town and under ten minutes from the strip.    The cashier, Chelsea, was very nice and told us that #2 and #3 are their most popular dishes.  It was happy hour.  We ordered a Fukuburger, Buta burger, and Tamago burger, Togarashi garlic fries, Sprite, Kirin can and Asahi draft.   The total cost for our food was $34.40, with the beers being $2.50 and $2.25, respectively.  Chelsea called out our silly nickname, \"Jasper\", when the order was ready.  Our food was ready in about ten minutes, very fast service.    We all agreed, these were some of the best burgers we have ever had.  The fusion of Asian sauces and the egg on my Tamago Burger made for a truly wonderful combination.  It was a bit messy but I didn't care at all since it tasted so good. The patties were juicy and marinated nicely.  The fries were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the garlic wasn't overpowering but a nice hint.  We all agreed we will be visiting again.  If you are ever in Vegas make the drive to this restaurant, you WON'T be disappointed.    See you next time Colin.  Great job on a wonderful fusion of Asian and American.",

My complain is mainly for their food and service.   For my second visit. I came here late at night. Service was alright on this visit. I ordered Katsu Burger but meat was definitely under cooked. I got to try my friend's Jazz Fries which was tasty and somewhat redeemed my inedible burger.  My most recent visit was what blew me off. I was deciding between their Kinoko Burger or Naga Dog.   Cashier: \"I like Naga dog. It's a hot dog with kimchi, relish, seaweed, etc. It's my favorite, you will love it!\" Me: \"Ok I will get one\"  Paid for it, tipped but didn't get the tip jelly which kinda sucks. My food was ready in 10 mins and while other customers were getting called by their funny nickname, the cashier just says \"YOUR NAGA DOG IS READY. NAGA DOG\" Yeah..that's fine.  Well...I did not like it. Weiner used is way too salty and overpowering that I could not taste any other flavor on this hot dog. Not to mention, it was completely burnt on both ends. Then the same cashier comes to the table  Cashier: \"How is your food?\" Me: \"Meh..it's alright. I enjoy your burger more than the hot dog. I don't think this was for me\" Cashier: \"Yeah I agree. Naga dog is just alright. It's not my favorite\"  EXCUSE ME???? You told me minutes ago that it was one of your favorite item? It's also questionable that an employee is not prideful of their product. Why not do something to improve then? Get your shit together.  Adios and sayonara Fuku, I won't see you again.",

We ordered the #6 chicken katsu burger, #3 buta burger (pork), and the jazz fries (fries with gravy and crack sauce). The chicken katsu was crispy and great but I thought it was too doughy between the batter and bread. The buta was very rich-- too rich-- and leaking with grease mixed with mayo and a few bites were enough for me. The fries tasted great but again, too much mayo, and they weren't crispy. In addition to the mayo overload, with the exception of the katsu burger, everything was very soggy and greasy which made the texture gummy in my mouth.  Due to the density of the burgers and the cream sauce, I'd recommend ordering one burger for two people and splitting an order of jazz fries if this is your first time here.",

The tables were spaced far enough apart to have a private conversation but close enough to make friends with all of the other crazies in Las Vegas in August.   Food: Excellent. I had the kinoko burger and it was everything I had imagined it would be from the pictures here on Yelp. Juicy, savory, deliciousness. Partner had the tamago. They were equally impressed with the runny egg and crunch of the burger. Very good. The jazz fries were fun and addicting, but I think I will just get the togarashi fries next time and enjoy how perfectly cooked they are.

My burger was a little spicy not too much. the meat was nice and fresh juicy. bun was nice and soft and the sauce was a little sweet very delicious my wife's Moco was filling and very large. It stayed hot through the last bite which is a good sign!  I would recommend this place and will definitely be back it's a good quick relatively inexpensive lunch.",

Yes, I will return to try the other six sandwiches as this first experience was very good but as a burger goes, this was not particularly special. Deserving still, the four stars even if only for the uniqueness ..a good experience!  Give it a try!",

It is by far not the best feature of this place but it sure does make it that much more appealing. The smells coming from the kitchen are intoxicating and the food looks delicious once you see it. The fries were on point and now I have to try the Jazzy fries cuz the garlic fries were absolutely amazing. The crispy chicken sandwich was just that crispy and delicious. I do wish there was more chicken to the sandwich but I do like two portions. I absolutely think this is a great place to take someone on a first date as they have games you can even play and they ask you to make a funny name for your order when you order in. Please don't disappoint yourself and take the food to go, sit down and enjoy the atmosphere. The music is something you can tap your foot to it is very family-friendly and the prices are the only downside but other than that definitely a place I will go again",

    "text": "I have to say I USED to love Fuku burger back when they only had a good truck. I made sure to look at their schedule online and went to their location. After years of not having it because they opened a restaurant at the Hawaiian Market Place and the Linq, my Husband and I finally went tonight. We have been craving it since we saw that the restaurant on Jones was opening.   We arrived around 6:40pm and they had a total of 3 other tables. Two of which already had their food. As I was ordering 2 guys came up and stated to one of the cooks that their sodas didn't taste right. Apparently the female cashier knew and said, \"yea I know we need to change the co2.\"  Um...if she knew why did she fill the cups and give them drinks? Anyhow, we didn't get our food until 7:22pm! Really, 42 minutes for 2 burgers and an order of garlic fries?! That's crazy! As I went to get our food (mind you the two cups from the 2 guys before were still on the counter, untouched) I asked what is going on with our drinks. One of the cooks said we are having trouble with the co2 and we are currently working on it. I said ok what are we going to drink since we have our food now? He gave me a blank look as the female cashier said I'll refund you the price of the drink and give you another non-fountain drink. As she was refunding me and giving me drinks (less than 2 mins) I returned to the table and started eating. Can I say really? The food was cold. Cold as if it had been sitting in the open. My burger was soggy on the bottom from the oil, the burger patty was hard as if it has been sitting out for hours and the fries? Let's not go there. I don't understand why it took so long for 1 and to be served cold food after we waited so long is beyond me.   I have to say we won't be back. It was a waste of our time and money. Oh, it was freezing inside! It was so cold you wouldn't enjoy being there either.",

Customers don't feel welcome here and is ashamed becouse the burgers are one of the best in Las Vegas",

It was great to see the brick-n-mortar location come about instead of having to deal with moving locations, driving across town, and/or the idiots of the different car clubs who can't keep it together.   The location is decent with plenty of parking nearby. It's definitely not been as busy as I would have thought given how popular the truck has been - but after having been there a few times I can see why.   Cost is higher, portions are not. The food also isn't as flavorful as from the truck. Half the time, half the fries are too soft/mushy. Aside from the crack sauce, I didn't really find that the sit-down location was as good as the truck. I'd much rather go find the truck than hit up the restaurant, honestly.",

I try not to look into stuff like this because its borderline paranoia, AND IM NOT accusing the restaurant of anything, but my friend and I walk in and theres a guy in front of us, he orders, then I order, then my friend, then a family of 6.  I ordered the easiest item...#1 w/o the wasabi/mayo.  For some reason i got my order last.  After my friend, the family of 6, etc.  I just didn't get why.  The place itself is nice.    Theres anime playing on the tv and also the football game was on as well.  I love that they tell you to pick a funny nickname for when they call you.  There is trap/hiphop playing in the background.  Pretty sure this place is ran by a young entrepreneur.  The woman behind the counter was nice.  She said they have a truck still on Fremont usually during the weekends.  If I wouldn't have gotten sick I would have given this place 5 stars but I'm still trying to recover from this food!  It crazy too because this location used to be a taco bell and I got sick from that food as well.  Maybe is just a bad omen on that location.",

The interior here reminds me of a gloomy teenager's room during his experimental phase. There are three or four TVs spread around the room; the walls feature Japanese-themed posters and paintings that are apparently on sale. Fuku's red and black color scheme makes this already small building seem even smaller and made me feel like the restaurant was cramped, even when it was not.    The cashier was friendly and was more than willing to let us know which burgers are the most popular and that the combo is worth much more than the burgers by themselves. She was great.   The food was unfortunately not that amazing. I ordered the #3 combo, which is the Buta Burger, I believe. The buns were very small compared to the burger patty, and my patty was too salty and a bit overcooked. I've had better. The one thing I enjoyed here were the Jazz fries, but they alone are not worth the price of over $10 for a combo.   Fuku Burger is a place I'd go back to if my friends want to go here, but not much more than that.",

It was a mouth-gasm to say the least. Everything about the experience was great! I brought an expired Groupon and they accepted it because as we all know the value of it never expires. I ordered the Katsu Chicken and Togahashi fries and they were enough to feed two ppl and so flavorful.  The Katsu looks like one chicken cutlet on the menu but i somehow got two and half pieces. It was all hot and fresh without the gimmicks of the chain restaurants.   Even though they shuttered their Strip location im glad to now see them in Chinatown.

It didn't fit.  So of course as I'm walking to the table the basket slides off my tray and all over the table and floor.  Of course in this age of the customer is always wrong the reply was they thought it fit. It's my fault.  What a customer service oriented business. I told them I would have preferred to carry 2 trays instead of one that was over loaded. So back to McDonalds, PTs, Burger King, Subway, Jersey Mike's and a host of other real restaurants. Regardless of the problem,  this food is over rated to begin with. Never cross their doors again.",

Ok so I've paid over $20 for a just burger before in a fancier place but to grab lunch and spend $20 on a burger combo in a fast food kind of place is kinda stupid.  Don't get me wrong, their burgers are very tasty and I will return. But I have to be really craving a burger with yummy mushrooms!  The staff is ok, not welcoming but they do what they get paid for.  The look of the place is hip and cute. If you want a yummy burger and don't mind spending the extra cash then try it!",

Their menu is the same ol Fuku Burger I've come to know and love since back in the food truck days during Westside Wednesdays.   I took my hubby here for his first time and we both got the spicy tamago (egg) burger and jazz fries.  Still loved the tamago burger but I'm not too fond of the jazz fries anymore. I think I liked it better back then and I think it'd be better with skinny fries instead.   Anywho, whether you're an old fan of Fuku Burger or never even heard of it before, check out this spot.   PS. I was told to give the cashier a funny name for when my food was ready and that totally caught me off guard and I failed. Lol so think of something beforehand if you suck at things like that such as myself.",

Fuku was outstanding.  I got the Tamago (w/ garlic fries and drink), and my wife and kids shared the FukuMoco. Everything was so good. The burger was messy and delicious, and the crack sauce was amazing; it was one of those sauces that I could eat with anything.  I liked that the menu was simple. Based on what we ate, I think it's safe to say they've mastered those handful of items and you're safe going with any of them.   This place is way better than Bachi and Burger Bar, IMO. Come here if you're in Vegas and craving a burger.",

Because of Thursday evening traffic, it did take a solid 28 minutes to get here, but it was worth it!   The menu is small, but so unique! My friend Mr. Y got the Chicken Katsu - Panko-encrusted chicken with shredded cabbage, finished with \"crack sauce\" and katsu sauce. This piece of chicken was huge! Probably about 9 inches long! Although this was a solid choice, we all agreed that some of the other choices were even better.   Hubby got the Fukumoco - Steamed white rice topped with all-beef Fukupatty, fried egg, brown gravy and bonito flakes. The gravy had a nice, mild flavor.   Ms. L and I both ordered the Buta - All-beef Fukupatty, applewood-smoked bacon, American cheese, pickled red onions and red ginger, Japanese BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. I got both sauces on the side, not knowing how crazy I'd be for them. But they were great! The BBQ was sweet and the mayo wasn't too spicy. This burger was definitely awesome!  I also got a side of Jazz Fries - Crispy garlic fries topped with brown gravy and crack sauce. That crack sauce was awesome! The gravy was nice, too. But next time I'd probably just go for the regular Fries with crack sauce.   I can't wait to go back and try something different! Maybe that burger with crispy onion strings and teriyaki....",

Menu is straight forward, went with the Chicken Katsu burger combo which comes with fries + drink (yes, refills are free)  The customer service is chill and the place is clean overall. They have some board games/cards if you want to stay longer than the meal :)  Eating area is pretty small, so you'll be close to everyone around you.  The food was SO GOOD. I'm usually not the type to get chicken for a burger....but it was chicken katsu. And it was amazing. Garlic fries are what come standard with the meals, I'd recommend the jazz fries if you want something new (you're welcome)   The food was made quickly and worth what I paid.   If you find yourself visiting often, get yourself the reward card to get them points. And don't forget to tip so you can get some tip jelly :))",

An employee at Luke's Lobster mentioned this place and we were glad we decided to give it a shot. How did this come into conversation? A women who ordered in front of us gave the name \"Beyonce\" for her order. When she walked away, the employee giggled and told us Fuku burger asks you to give them a funny name to say on their loud speaker when your food was ready for pick-up. He claimed it to be different than Bachi Burger and we humbly agree. It's located in a strip mall and was once an old T-bell (looks to be anyway) Flavorful burgers. The patty itself is ample. Thicker than In&Out. Messy, like... You'll get sauce on your hands kind of messy. I ordered the #4 Kinoko and gobbled that beast up. I personally wished there was a little more mayo vs teriyaki, but that's just me! We ordered garlic fries, but I didn't really taste garlic. It was either super light or maybe a style I'm not accustomed to. Thick cut fries (in between shoe string and steak fries).  Pepsi products.  The price is perfect. You're paying for a semi fancy burger, but you're not paying for wait staff at a gastropub. Get in, get out. Fast and painless.",

I had the Kinoko burger the mushroom were perfect not too salty I loved the sauce mixed with the crispy pickled ginger. It was such an awesome flavor combination. Staff was friendly and service was quick. The only negative is that I wish they had unflavored plain ice tea.",

I ordered the #1 Fuku and my boyfriend ordered the #2 Tamago (fried egg). We ordered them as a combo that included a drink and garlic fries. We brought the food home and devoured everything! The burgers were huge and extremely flavorful. It was a bit messy to eat but we didn't care. In addition, we loved the crack sauce that came with the meal. It went so well with the garlic fries.   Overall, this is a great place if you're wanting good quality burgers. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well. We will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Unique Japanese-fusion (maybe Japanese-Hawaiian) burger place.  I'd driven by about 20 times going to other places in the area, and decided to stop in. Definitely worth it.  The burgers include \"regular\" beef burgers, an egg  topping option, pork, chicken katsu, and specials.  It's a tiny bit more expensive than fast food, but still not expensive ($11 for a burger, drink, and fries).  I tried the \"fuku burger\" which is pretty close to a normal burger, with a spicy wasabi sauce.  The other options are far more adventurous.  This is clearly a business which is trying hard to be unique and which does a great job on their concept.",

You can read the description on their menu but let's just say it will be the best dang flavor explosion you have put in your mouth this week. Maybe this month. How about this year?  My first bite caused the perfectly cooked sunny side up egg yolk to burst open running all over my plate. My initial reaction was disappointment and I felt myself slipping from heaven until I quickly realized I could dip my fantastic burger into the golden egg yolk remains on my plate.  Now securely back in burger heaven bliss, I enjoyed every bite of my Tamago burger.  Now a question for you. What the heck are you doing still reading this? You should be finding your way to Fuku Burger. NOW!",

I tried the Tamago (egg) burger with side of garlic fries with some Chicago to wash it all down. Being a burger lover I have to admit it hit the spot. The patty they use is high quality and you can just taste it. I will return again to try all of the selections .  It's no surprise now to me why fuku deserves the recognition here in Las Vegas.

They mainly offer burgers obviously but also have a hot dog on the menu. I settled for the pork burger (burger with bacon)and was very happy, 4.5 - 5 star on the burger. Fries were just okay with many over burnt pieces and too much seasoning but the burger was great.   They didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked but didn't mind trying it how they serve it which seemed like medium rare. Very juicy (without dripping though) and great flavors and unique toppings.   They didn't have ice tea. Ugh. Had to spend extra for a can of coconut water which was good they had.   I'll be back one of these days when I'm craving a late night burger, which is fairly often. Don't wait years to ceck them out like I did, enjoy!",

The only noticeable flavor on my burger was overly sweet teriyaki sauce. The sauce drowned out the taste of the egg, the crispy onions, and the wasabi mayo. The burger itself was over cooked and only seasoned with very sweet teriyaki.   The fries were even more bland. The brown gravy had no flavor, the crack sauce only had a mild mayo flavor, and the fries had very little garlic on them.  This place is a very cool concept, but so poorly executed. I couldn't even finish my food.   It's amazing that the burger and fries could be piled with so many toppings, yet taste so bland and unseasoned.  I was hoping to make this place a new favorite, but I unfortunately will not be back.  2 stars because the food was at least somewhat edible and the staff is very nice.",

My burger had an egg on it, with a teriyaki sauce, I believe it was a #2. My honey burger had bacon on it, I think #3, and my son's had cabbage and hint of spice #5 I think.  Regardless of what number they were the burgers were all moist and were created with a special twist of garnish that just made each burger pop in your mouth with sensation!!!!!  The fries have a special seasoning as well which made them yummy!  If you go be sure to tip at the register and receive a special treat",

I ordered the mushroom burger and my friend order the classic cheeseburger. I honestly enjoyed hers a lot more. I thought mine was way to salty. The mushrooms were overpowered by the potent teriyaki sauce they smother the patty in. I didn't really enjoy it.  Their fries were good though!  Crispy and crunchy and you can tell its freshly made. If I come here again, I think I'll just stick to their traditional burger with cheese, lettuce and tomato.",

The cashier was so sweet and helpful with making a decision on what my first burger should be! Followed by the infamous jazz fried! Make it a meal? Why not add my Diet Coke on there please! $13 and some change later I left pleasantly pleased! Next day I went for the #6 Chicken Katsu burger and even more amazing! Great burgers and even better customer service I would recommend this place to anybody that's ready to indulge in a great burger or two!",

I'm so happy I can finally shove your burgers in my mouth without having to deal with the strip or the disappointment of your truck never being out when I have a craving!  The quality standards set by the food truck are clearly carried over to this location, with the added bonus of having an actual table to eat at. A little pricy, but no more than any other premium burger joint.. And honestly, you can spend just as much or more at Carl's Jr, if you aren't careful.   Several tvs hang on the wall, NOT playing sports from what I can, thank god. One appeared to be looping a power rangers episode, another cartoon network, another playing anime. Games like Jenga were set up along the wall for play. Very clean restaurant, with stellar service. I can tell this is going to be a long lasting relationship.",

Very good, correct seasoning on the patty with bit of Unami from the sauces.   Jazz fries-fried correctly, not over done and \"jazzed up\" with garlic seasoning. The gravy was hot and the \"crack\" sauce cool and spicy.   Job well done.",

I have to say it's more of a kickback and chill kind of place. More for people who just left a party and want to just grab a bite to eat. This is the go to place for that.  The only thing is it's really small and I'm sure if a group of people go it'll get crowded real quick.  But overall the food is great",

I've always raved about it but always felt discouraged by finding the truck and the crowd that pools around. But finally! An actual restaurant and within my area. One that's relatively clean and decorative. Good vibes. I'm all about good vibes.   However... I've gotta say I'm becoming more and more disappointed each time I come and sometimes it's due to lack of service and others the food tastes a little more bland. This time though two for of the four burgers were extremely undercooked. Like full on MUSHY. I'm not even sorry just because we hate well done patties but really? We were even going to overlook it by taking it home and reheating it... Until I went back to the counter. I got one of the cooks attention after a few minutes of standing there. I was asking for some boxes but I brought up one of the burger to show him how undercooked it was so he's aware. He says oh ok, and walks away. Just maybe I was looking for a little customer service and acknowledgement.. but now you have an uncertain customer with a pissed off boyfriend and an unimpressed brother. I'm just praying they don't get sick after reading another's review.   Sorry Colin. I'm still willing to give it a shot in the future but this is probably going to be one of the last times I do.",

I've known about Fuku for a long time now, back to when it use to just be the truck. Now that there is a location that it close to my house, I am there about once or twice a week. The service is always friendly and the atmosphere is fitting for people in my age group. There are games to play and lots of shows to watch inside.  Whenever I go to Fuku I always get a Tamago burger. The Tamago burger is basically their burger with an egg and friend onions, but I like to ask for mushrooms in it as well. This is my favorite item on the menu and it's been my go-to choice ever since their days as just being the truck. Their fries are also great, but I like to have my sauces on the side so the fries stay crispy! Also, if you choose to tip, the whole staff says \"tip jelly!\" out loud and you receive a fruit jelly stick as a thank you.  The only thing I have to say about Fuku is that it's a little pricey for a medium sized burger, and sometimes they can also be overcooked. Overall it's still a great place to hang out and eat at.",

The last four or five times, every single time, my burger has been absolutely gross. It looks cooked mostly through (and I'm certainly not scared of a little pink) but the inside is cold and mushy and a horrible texture, like semi raw I guess. I kept giving this place a chance thinking oh it's really busy right now, oh maybe they have new staff tonight and it used to be so amazing but I'm fed up.   I think I'll try the other location on the strip, hopefully they are better. The jazz fries have always been amazing here, so there's that. Sad to say I won't be back after almost a year (and my boyfriend even longer!) of going here.  Update: their strip location has closed. Says a lot.

When I say small, it's pretty small. The decorations inside are pretty cool, it's like a Japanese anime setting kinda place, lol.   Anywho, let's get to the food. So, they only have 6 burgers to choose from. I got the Fuku Bugrer #1, my boyfriend got the Buta burger #3, and my brother got the Tomago burger #2. Out of the 3 burgers we got my brothers burger was the best. He had a burger with grilled onions, a fried egg and furikake sprinkled on top. Oh my goodness, so bomb. My burger was alittle sweet and salty didn't really like it. And my boyfriend had bacon in his, which he liked. Each burger cost $7.99, but you can do a combo which has fries and a drink that adds up to $13-$14. Not bad.   In all, it was pretty good. I don't think I could eat here on the daily, probably because when we picked up our burgers you could see how oily it was. But, it's good if you want to try something different. The way they set up the good in the tray is photo worthy, lol. I didn't for the photo honestly. Anyways, try this place out :)",

It's always impressive when such a successful business still has the owner on location making sure everything is at the highest standard. The restaurant itself embodies the Fuku Fam image and supports local artists. It's nice that ever since the Fuku food truck the food has always been spot on! My favorite is the Naga dog, it's a unique hot link dressed with Kimchi and Fuku sauces. I'm really pleased they have a permanent location for me to satisfy those cravings.",

Also be on the look out for their food truck as it makes random spots throughout the valley.",

    "text": "\"Order for Asshole...Asshole??\" I LOL'd as the guy behind me went to the counter to pick up his food. The cashier told us to give a funny name for our order, I chose Pinkie. I thought Asshole was very unoriginal, but still funny to hear them call it out.  The food is Japanese fusion. The menu is small and consists mainly of burgers, a hot dog and a chicken sandwich, as well some french fry options. You can order ala carte or upgrade to a combo for $13.99 which is what I decided to do. That got me the tamago burger, (fuku patty with furikake, teriyaki, fried egg and crispy onion strings) garlic fries, and a soft drink. The burger was realllly tasty. It was juicy and flavorful, with the egg and the crispy fried onion strings adding extra flavor and crunch. The fries, meh. I appreciate that they were crispy, but I didn't taste too much garlic and the crack sauce was just okay. It's a mayo-based sauce, and it's not horrible, but I didn't think it was crack-like, meaning I wouldn't go back for more.   I will definitely be back to try some other items. I hope this place stays afloat. The last few businesses that occupied this space went under fairly quickly, and I hope that was due to the product and not the location.",

The toppings and seasonings are bold and very flavorful. They really know how to dress up a burger here. The reason I'm giving Fuku 4 stars instead of 5 is the fries. I had the garlic fries and they weren't seasoned evenly. They were cooked well, but the seasoning was great on some fries and on others it was missing. The burgers are seasoned with such bold flavors, but the fries don't live up to the same standard. The burgers are great, the fries are good.",

What a great success story! 2 days of car dealership haggling for in-laws deserves a  guilty pleasure so we headed south of Sahara to indulge. The location is anime splashed with cool super hero artwork catering to a demographic mix of saggy jeans, gamers, hipsters and AnimAsians. The menu is simple yet overpriced for a burger and extra for choice of fries & drink (medium or large). I saw Katsu on the menu & knew it's usually dark meat but the cashier girl said it was white when I asked. I don't like dark meat but ordered it on her word as an employee who should know the menu. Fukume, it was dark meat. The Jazz Fries with gravy & crack sauce sounded good but were not. It didn't taste close to anything like gravy...more like a strange sweet sauce. The crack sauce tasted like a spicy mayo and fries were swimming in this stuff. I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. Not what I hoped for. Gravy & fries should taste like real gravy. I wanted to eat like a fat man here but didn't enjoy it enough to spend the calories and I don't think a good value at $7.99 for a burger plus $5.50 extra for fries & drink. I'd hope for a recipe revamp but the other Fukers probably wouldn't like it.",

I've tried all of their burgers and they have something for everybody, from traditional to spicy. The jazz fries steal the show, though. The crack sauce is exactly that. It's addicting and leaves you wanting more. Overall a great atmosphere, it goes well with the theme of the food. Their only downfall is the change in their hours. I wish they were still open late, like they used to be.   Overall a great place. And if you're visiting Las Vegas, a Must try.",
