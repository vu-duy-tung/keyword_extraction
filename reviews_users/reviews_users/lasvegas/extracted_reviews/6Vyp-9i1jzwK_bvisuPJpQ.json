I ordered the batter fried Lobsicle- lobster tail on a stick ($14). When it came out, I was disappointed by how small it was. Lobster is expensive, but still. Aside from that, I enjoyed it. It was lightly battered and tender. I also tried my friend's Cajun lobster roll. It was small and bland. I wouldn't come here again, but am glad I tried them.",

    "text": "Lobster ME has beckoned me to visit every single time I've walked past it en route to Earl of Sandwich from the Planet Hollywood parking garage. Today, I finally answered the call.  Back in December, I was fortunate enough to win a $10 credit for Lobster ME at a Yelp event (see Yelp Helps: NPO-Yeah! for more info). This made any expenditure at this place a much more tolerable option, although I still anticipated having to shell out something for a Strip location that happened to serve the arguably already overpriced treat known as lobster.  I pretty much went straight to the Original \"Maine Style\" lobster roll. I limited myself to the medium size at $17, rather than go for the large size at $23, the difference being $7 vs. $13 out of pocket for me. This is described as Maine lobster with a touch of mayo, lemon, and a secret spice blend. I didn't taste too much mayo and I am reasonably sure that there's turmeric in the spice mix, but I can't be too sure beyond that.  This roll is pretty good! I definitely enjoyed the buttery, soft roll that still had a nice crunch, the ample chunks of lobster meat and claw, and the aforementioned mayo and spices. I probably would have given them four stars on the spot, but during the drive home I realized that it just didn't strike a memorable enough chord with me. Flavor aside, I'm pretty sure I'm barely over half full from that \"medium' roll, if that.  Overall, I can see this being a convenient luxury food option for somebody with money to burn or for a tourist who feels trapped in Planet Hollywood / the Miracle Mile Shops, but I just wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. There's just so many great places around Vegas that aren't so pricey.",

I'm a fan of lobster, especially when I don't have to crack the shell and get messy eating it. This place is pricey for a quick lunch, but it was delicious nonetheless. You'll spend about $20 bucks plus for lunch for one. I don't regret my purchase, I only regret eating it so fast because it was soo good.  I ordered the Cajun Lobster roll, fries, and a drink. The roll comes toasty/grilled and buttery with good chucks of lobster meat stuffed on hotdog style. I could eat 4 of these easily because each bite was so juicy, buttery with a hint of crisp from the roll. The lobster had a nice cajun spice to it which added another dimension to the flavor.   Punch line: Come here for delicious hassle free lobster!",

Lobster rolls became an addiction for me and it all started at this joint that's always jam packed with a line of people trying to fulfill their drunchies or simply trying to start their day after a long night of unce unce unce-ing.  I have to have a lobster roll (the Conneticut; steamed lobster) with fries and a Coke. It's a little pricey but worth every bite, especially when you have a few drinks in you. I love the toasted bun and the generous serving of lobster you can taste in each bite. There are several options but I enjoy the plain ol' Connecticut lobster roll here so much that I refuse to try anything else. They offer promotions here and there, and during my last stay it was buy a lobster roll, get chowder fries for the free. Best day ever!? Chowder fries.. Just yes. They're melt in your mouth good and they don't skimp out on the chunky goodness.  The service is fast and friendly. Which makes the lines go by quickly. Definitely one of the better options within Miracle Mile if you're ever hunting down something filling.",

Also, if you check in on FourSquare they will give you a discount on your tab! Since I forgot to show them my check-in until after we had paid, they offered to give us something for free, which is how we ended up with the bisque. We tried-  -Lobster Mac n Cheese- Really creamy and rich tasting, but could have used more salt. The lobster pieces are on the smaller side and are sprinkled on top of the mac n cheese. -Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche- Good, but not the best ceviche you'll have. A decent amount of lobster was in the ceviche, overall the dish is very pricey. -Lobster Bisque- The best dish that we ordered! The bisque was creamy and delicious, and you can taste the buttery goodness. -Lobster Ice Cream- We just tried a free sample but wow! It wasn't delicious.. but way better than I expected. The person working there explained that it was a Butter Maple based ice cream (or was it Vanilla Maple.. something along those lines) and they added chunks of lobster to the ice cream. I don't think I would order this, but it was definitely worth trying!  Overall, come to Lobster Me if you're craving lobster. I think we would have been more satisfied if we went with the standard lobster roll. However, this place is on the pricey side for what you get, and there are plenty of other places to eat at in Sin City.",

Think the decent thing to eat here is the Lobster Roll ($20 for large combo, fries and a drink).    The Mac n Cheese lobster took 20 minutes to make and it wasn't that great at all. It was simply just mac n cheese and they put lobster on top.  Lobster was cold and didn't seem fresh at all.  Lobster Bisque- (soup) was okay.  Lobster salad - I can make this dish better at home.  Pass on this one. Just salad and topped of with lobster. Nothing crazy.  Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche - The only thing that was decent (along with the Lobster roll), it was fresh and tasty, but TINY.  Lobsicle (battered lobster on a stick) - Tiny and nothing great.   All this was around $100.... expensive. Expected way more...

Lobster roll, lobster bisque, shrimp tacos, shrimp salad... All delicious! Last time I was in Vegas I made one A.M. visits two days in a row... The greatest drunken sustenance EVER!   Only thing was the place wasn't incredibly clean but I'll chalk that up to being in the middle of the mall and at the whim of random passerbyers.  Also, the famed lobster roll was served  chilled.  Tasted slightly odd to me because of this, but I guess I'm no lobster roll connosieur...",

It's a cute little shop that does lobster rolls, lobster fish and chips and varietys of other lobster things. I chose the lobster fish and chips with Cajun fries that comes with a complimentary coleslaw. YUMMY IN MY TUMMY. My friends were eating their chilli dogs and watching  me with envy. I devoured my meal. The lobster was tender not overcooked, the fries lightly seasoned to perfection and the coleslaw was sweet and cream just the way I liked it. My only complaint if the portion size was small. I know lobster is expensive but they could give your more fries and more slaw bump it up from 13 to 15. I was still a bit hungry afterwards. I regret not trying their lobster rolls they have hot and cold ones. They look like the real deal and Ronnie told me it's a full lobster in every roll.",

I shared the lobster roll and ceviche with my friend . The roll was nice and buttery with huge chunks of lobster.... i finished it to quick :( . ... I wanted more!!!. The ceviche came in a mango salsa thing with shrimp . And these crispy flour tortilla chips. Soooooo good!! It is a bit sweet so if you do not like sweet mango salsa dont get it...  But honestly everything was epic in my book.   Ooo and of coarse I had to have a lobster shooter. Imagine a little shooter with bloody mary Mix.  Little bit of lobster and vodka for 5 dollars!!!! Uhhhh so good!. That I did not share ;).   I recommend this place 100 %",

Seating is limited in front of the little restaurant but there is some large ottoman seating behind the tables if you're lucky. Ordered a lobsicle (lobster deep fried on a stick) and lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. The lobsicle is a pretty big portion than I was expecting. It is a little bit rubbery since it's deep fried. I do like that they give you liquid butter to dip it in. The lobster Mac 'n' Cheese is a better menu selection. There were small pieces of lobster that were more tender and I enjoyed the panko crumbs they added on top. I say this place is good for a quick bite while you're doing your shopping.",

The lobster was tender and meaty and tasted really fresh! The sourdough bread bowl full of bisque was awesome. Scraping the sides with each bite made me happy. Pro tip: if you're a local you get 20% off!!! I was almost going to get their special. It was chowder fries. French fries topped with cheese sauce, bacon, clam chowder, and parsley. It sounded great, maybe next time :) the lobsicle looked delish too!! Think corn dog but with a lobster tail and thinner batter. We sat at the little bar top and enjoyed every bite of our meal. We will for sure return!!!!!",

I have to disagree, and this is based on taste, type of meat, and possibly luck.    Maybe I was unlucky to get an off-night lobster roll.  It was filled with claw meat, didn't get too much tail in my roll.  It's very lightly dressed, and while that may be a ploy to say,\"we're not going to hide our fresh lobster taste!\" what it ended up doing was make it painfully obvious that the roll was drenched in butter.  Lobster rolls I'm used to are more like lobster salad on bread.  And when I said filled, I didn't mean filled like bursting at the seams, I just meant that's what thye filled my sandwich with.  The bread to lobster meat ratio was something like 3:1, and it was tourist priced as heck, actually everything is here.  My wife got the lobsicle and the lobster ice cream.  I would describe the lobsicle as a split lobster tail tempura skewered and fried.  And the lobster ice cream was just a mild vanilla-ish ice cream with lobster meat.  It was ridiculous, like $5 for a small.  Don't get me wrong, I like weird Filipino ice cream, with corn and with cheese, but this just wasn't for me.    I'll eat here again maybe, but I probably won't get the lobster roll.  I'd probably just get the lobster and chips, but more likely, I'd save my appetite and my skrilla for Boiling Crab or Hot n Juicy.",

This is the location I frequent the most here in Las Vegas, ok so I was out with a group for dinner and a show, there were five of us at the time. The Staff had no issues getting our big ass order together. (Dan was super cool and patient with us)  We ordered a lot, no holds barred this night.  Lobster Roll Fish and Chips Lobster mac and cheese Lobster grilled cheese sandwich something, it was Amazing!!!  Chowder bread bowl Big basket of crunchy fried chips/fries Slaw   This visit was crazy but fun, I wish I could eat here every day but I know is not practical. I don't think I could ever get tired of their menu seriously.  I highly encourage ordering my three favorite items, lobster mac and cheese, fish and chips and lobster roll/sandwich.  In my opinion the prices are standard, I mean you get what you pay for, I think the quality is high and worth what you get. This is a specialty meal menu, you can't find Maine style lobster rolls or lobster mac and cheese on every corner.",

This time there was a few of us so we got a couple of items: The Frenchy (brie/lobster panini), the Lobster Grilled Cheese, the Lobster Cheese Fries, the Beltway (lobster sandwich with old bay seasoning) and last but not least, the Lobster Mac and Cheese! We went lobster crazy!   The Frenchy (is the sandwich I had myself) is very light breading if you want something lighter than the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was bomb too! All of it was bomb. The lobster mac and cheese was pretty much the best one for me though.  Definitely hit up this spot of you have a hankering for some lobster everything.",

All lobster rolls (especially Connecticut style) are subject to being compared to the gold standard of all Connecticut style lobster rolls...Neptune Oyster House in Boston's North End.    I visit Planet Hollywood a few times a year for work and/or fun.  I have stopped by Lobster Me for a hot lobster roll twice.  Service was fine.  The roll is a little small.  It is really more of a big snack versus a meal, but that is fair considering the price of lobster.   I'm sure I will stop by for a late afternoon snack or something again.  Just won't go out of my way for it.",

We opted for the chowder to come in a bread bowl and we devoured every piece of it! I loved that it wasn't too salty, not too thick or too runny... it was just right! The Crab fries were on a special menu and we felt although this place screams 'lobster', we just had to try the crab! I'm very glad we did because it was probably better than the chowder! I honestly was full from the two but couldn't stop shoving these fries in my mouth! I was addicted!   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the lack of seating and how overpriced the food was. But I still enjoyed our meal here!",

This place is located inside the Miracle Mile Shops, in Planet Hollywood.  I didn't opt for the lobster roll like mainly everyone was doing, but instead got the crab cake burger, and was glad I did because it's a bigger portion than the roll, for about $14 and it comes these seasoned waffle fries which made for a perfectly delicious and filling dinner under $20 bucks.",

The seating is very limited and at the time, it was very crowded but luckily we got a table.    I decided on the lobster roll which comes with fries, coleslaw and a drink.  I also ordered a lobster Bloody Mary cause I could not resist that it came with a lobster in the drink plus I love Bloody Mary's! My bf ordered the lobster mac & cheese and a beer.  Our total came out to I think about $60 or maybe it was more, I can't remember.  But all I know is I thought that it was ridiculously overpriced yes even though it was lobster.  For that price, I could of eaten a nice meal at a fancy pantsy restaurant.    The food itself was good but nothing that made me say wow. The lobster mac & cheese almost tasted like they just mixed in lobster to Velveeta mac & cheese. I did enjoy sipping on my lobster Bloody Mary and loved that I could walk around the mall with it!  The perks of Vegas!    Like someone said, the portions seemed a bit small for the price you pay.  Would I go back here? Probably not.  But at least I fulfilled my lobster cravings.",

I was skeptical, because my previous experience with Lobster Rolls was with Luke's Lobster Rolls down the street (see my review) and LOVED IT. But my boss and his coworker were convinced this place was delicious and worth it..and who would say no to free lobster? ...well, let's just say I wish I had.   I ordered their New England Lobster Roll. I tend to be rather traditional when it comes to lobster and I'm not much for spicy, I like to taste the meat! But the roll was behind disappointing, I felt nauseous after eating it and immediately regretted my decision. This roll was little more than lobster stuffed on hot dog bun. The bun was not buttered or toasted and the meat was not seasoned. It was all just so bland and the price was higher than Luke's (although coleslaw and fries are included, whereas with Luke's they are additional) for a fraction of the quality.   I did like that you had options for you roll \"style\" (Cajun, The Connecticut, The Beltway etc) should you feel like getting creative and you can swap regular waffle fries for crab fries (which I did.) They weren't bad, but the sauce and the meat makes them soggy almost immediately.   Again, save your money and go to Luke's, you can thank me later. I swear to you the extra travel time is worth it!!",

The Lobster Bisque was creamy and warming. I have to come back to try the Lobsicle (fried lobster tail...on a stick!).  Service: The cashier was very nice and helpful as he gave us some suggestions on which comedy shows are good in Vegas.  Value: I feel like the food was a little over priced. $17 for the roll and $9 for the soup. It's kind of what you expect with any food inside a casino on the strip though.   Ambiance: Seating area was a little dark, but I think that's on Miracle Mile Shops not Lobster Me. :)",

Saturday, I was at the Miracle Mile shops doing some shopping for my wedding, and was STARVING by the time I'd found what I needed.    We had walked by Lobster ME on the way to the store, and I decided that I wanted to eat here.   I was a little overwhelmed with the choices...Lobster rolls, Lobster Mac n cheese, Lobster bisque, Grilled cheese with lobster...Its not a huge menu, but all of the options looked great!  I decided to go with the Original Maine Lobster Roll with soup and a drink.   The clam chowder was delicious.  Thick, hearty, and seasoned well.    I'd never had a lobster roll before, but this was really good.  The bread was like a Texas toast consistency, with a little bit of mayo and a HUGE helping of cold lobster meat, seasoned with Old Bay.    De.Licious.   The lobster was amazing, and flavorful. There was a ton of it, too!  The bread had a great consistency.    I'd gladly come back here the next time I'm on the strip.  It was really great.",

I had a traditional lobster roll while my husband opted for the lobster mac n cheese. My roll was perfect: the bread was well toasted, there was plenty of succulent lobster, and the overall flavor was great. Of course I had to try my husbands, and his was delicious too. My only critique of the mac n cheese was the container it was in; it could've been in the same container as the other items to get a better bite of all of the ingredients together (if that makes any sense). Of course it's a couple dollars more than I would want to spend normally, but let's be real: it's The Strip. What do you expect? And for this quality of seafood it's honestly a good deal.",

This place pales in comparison to even 3 Buoys, the least good lobster I've ever had in all of Maine. It scratched an itch for lobster when we weren't able to get rezos for the Sterling Buffet, but from now on I'll stick to Red Lobster when I'm not in the northeast.  The Connecticut lobster roll isn't on the board anymore but they took our order for it without batting an eyelash. The online menu says the lobsicle is tempura'd, but it's just lightly battered and fried. The lobsicle was better than the roll, but as the county fair will teach you, anything is tastier deep fried on a stick. Made me think of the Will It Deep Fry? series on YouTube.",

We just visited Vegas again, and my entire plan consisted of drinking, gambling, laying out by the pool and eating at Lobster Me.  I stayed at a casino way too far away from my beloved Lobster roll (won't make that mistake again next time), so I literally took a cab just to go get it.  Then, I texted my husband a picture of my lobster roll as seen here, and the words \"mmmmm.....Lobster Me\".  To avoid a very bitter husband, I had to agree to deliver one to him at the poker table a few blocks away.  My only complaint is that we really really need one of these places in Colorado.",

Lobster ME Signature Roll The bread they use is excellent for the lobster but there was a great lack of care when it came to how they cut the roll.  It was cut at a diagonal and nowhere near down the center.  Having the roll cut at a diagonal meant way too little lobster for the amount paid.  The table next to us in the open seating area had the same roll, but appeared to have a better hand dealt to them in terms of amount of lobster in the roll.  I've had about 15 different lobster po-boys in my life and this place takes last (in terms of price and amount of lobster).  Maryland Blue Crab  The mixture (similar to a tuna salad mix), was decent.  The Blue Crab was definitely present in the mix, but it has a strong fishy smell you get when crab has sat  for a while.   We came here after going to Jaburrito the night before and used the 10% off coupon they gave us.   Jaburrito was excellent compared to Lobster Me (different type of food but I'd expect the same quality as Jaburrito).",

The lobster??? on the lobster roll was very stingy, and unidentifiable as lobster as opposed to shrimp or crawfish or even sirimi, in some cases.  It was mostly bread. I just tried them again, and after twenty minutes (with three other customers...so they were SLOW), my lobster mac n cheese came out cool.  Not cold, but not even room temperature.  And this was after they stressed how hot it was.  I took one taste of a noodle (very metallic flavour) and took it back to them, stating it was cool.  15 minutes later the \"night shift supervisor\" came out and informed me that it still wasn't ready.  Did I want to purchase something else?  Were they nuts?  Over 35 minutes wasted waiting on food that never appeared.  They claim that they voided the sale, but I can see the charge on my credit card; we'll see if it goes away. Do yourself a favour, don't bother with this place!!!!!",

I saw Lobster Mac N' Cheese on the menu and my heart jumped out of my chest. Ever since I saw/heard about lobster mac n' cheese on one of my favorite television shows Royal Pains, I've been wanting to have it. Honestly though, I had no idea it actually existed! It wasn't horribly priced for lobster I guess, but 10 bucks is still a little too much to drop for this dish, even though it was really good. The mac n' cheese was delicious. Made with what you could tell to be real cheese, flavorful, and the perfect texture (that mix of smooth and finely grated cheese). The lobster was only okay, which is why Lobster Me I don't think warrants any better than three stars for this dish. It was good, friendly service, but the food just didn't match up to my dreams and expectations of what it was going to be like. I don't regret trying it and if I'm ever back in Vegas someday soon I want to go back to try the lobster roll.",

My friend got the original; I got the El Diablo rolls with fries, and they were both amazing. The bread was great because it was almost like a garlic toast, and it just made the lobster roll that much better.   A bit on the pricey side, but considering that it's on the strip, it's actually not too bad.   And locals get a 20% off!! :D I deducted one star because even though my friend's also from Vegas, she didn't get the discount... we think the cashier might be new.",

I thought it was a little expensive but then soon realized that we were in the middle of the dessert which is why its a few more dollars. The roll was warm, and lightly toasted. What kind of puzzled me was that the lobster was cold. I automatically assumed it was going to be warm and drenched with butter. i was not dissappointed just a little surprised by the combination of the warm roll and cold lobster. Nonetheless, it was good especially if you are a seafood lover like me.  Big chunks of lobster cold or warm will always make me happy!!!",

Besides that, you can tell the lobster is good quality and fresh. Very meaty. I found the large a little small, I can't imagine how small the small is for the price they charge.

No flavor and it didn't even taste like Mac and Cheese. I only came back here because Gordon Ramsay Burger was too busy to take carry out orders and I was in a rush to get back to the hotel.   Lobster ME is located inside of Miracle Shops Mall in the little food area next to Fat Tuesday's. I stood in line for a good 15 minutes before my order was taken and there were nothing but about 4-5 people ahead of me. That is ridiculous! Then I waited another 10 minutes for my food to arrive. So not worth the wait. One star knocked off.   Instead of the Mac and Cheese, I got a lobster roll which wasn't bad. It was seasoned well and they used big pieces of meat. The problem? The roll was 80% bread and 20% lobster. Lobster rolls are already small, but they cut the tiniest slit into the bread and pretty much just plopped a little lobster on top. Every time I picked it up, all the lobster fell out. Another star gone.   I would come back here as a last resort if I couldn't get to Luke's Lobster on the other side of the strip outside of Fashion Mall. WAY BETTER service and quality.",

I ordered the New England Signature Lobster Roll which costed a whooping $24 bucks.... I was actually surprised it came with fries so I guess that made it a bit more worth it. If it was just the roll alone..yeah that's pretty expensive. (I can go to slapfish and get a roll for 16 and it tastes better then this). I wasn't too impressed with the taste and I wouldn't say its worth what I paid for. I still can't find the hype in the roll. Maybe I should have ordered the lobster mac?

    "text": "After spending a couple hours at a nearby pool, it was time for lunch, and for some reason I was thinking LOBSTA. Yes, just like that with the Boston accent.  On our way to getting Fat Tuesdays, we checked out Lobster ME (for Maine duh); I had passed by this spot countless of times but it's mostly been closed. For the weekend we went, we separated our team into two lines: one for the booze, and one for the seafood.  Lobster ME offers plenty of great wholesome foods infused with lobster meat. They've got it all from classic Lobster Rolls to more creative fare such as the Lobster Mac N' Cheese, Crab Nachos, and Lobster Fries. Our group grabbed a bunch of these starchy goodness and everything was pretty good. The mac n' cheese was by far my favorite.  As for me, I ordered the Mexican Cobb Salad ($16) which was topped with lobster meat, black beans, and corn. It was my attempt at being a bit healthy during the weekend, and I felt I succeeded very well in that department. The salad was refreshing and the bits of lobster meat sprinkled on top added a lot to the dish.  However good the salad was, I probably would go for the fries or mac n' cheese as my favorite of the dishes we tried. The spot is definitely worth a visit so grab a bite and sip on some Fat Tuesdays to enjoy your Vegas trip.",

(Or eating anything on the strip for that matter) all of the lobster rolls I've tried have been amazing. Just make sure that if you get the fries that you get them chowda style! Loaded with New England clam chowder. So delicious. It's expensive and there aren't a lot of places to sit but it is good quality food with large pieces of claw meat. They do offer a military discount. (Possibly a locals discount but I can't remember for sure) I will continue to eat here when I'm back in town!",

    "text": "We were looking for a quick and inexpensive lunch. I was really craving a lobster roll - but most of the ones in Vegas are over $30! Lobster ME is located inside the planet Hollywood shopping plaza near the Fat Tuesday drink stand.   They sell lobster rolls, other seafood rolls, lobster mac, and many other lobster dishes. For the rolls, you can customize your \"style\" like New England or siraccha. We got the signature lobster roll New England style for $24. Good thing is that each sandwich comes with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle. The pictures on yelp and their stand are definitely deceiving! For $24, you would think it would be overflowing with lobster....  I would give the sandwich a 3.5/5 for taste - I've had better lobster rolls that were very juicy and buttery. This one was okay....the lobster was good but not amazing and for $24 not worth the large price tag! I would opt for chipotle or some other fast food joint for a more filling meal. However, if you are in the mood for lobster rolls, I would try this place out because it is probably cheaper than other nicer restaurants on the strip. It's also fast so you can grab and go without worrying about time constraints.",

The food tasted great but the ordering process is slowwww. If a customer orders a drink, the cashier stopped and made it herself. With her being the only cashier at lunch, the line moved at a snails pace. The tacos were cute, but at this price point, I wouldn't rush to come back.",

The Lobster Mac n Cheese was good, however the best part of it was the Mac n cheese. The lobster tacos I ordered without tortillas were just so-so. I think the downfall of this place is that the lobster is just not that fresh.  If it's over 100 degrees outside, it's going to be hard to keep seafood super fresh. When in doubt, stick to non-seafood items in the summer on the strip! The presentation looked great and service was very good here - I think if I visited here in the fall, winter, or spring, I would have felt differently about the product.",

I've had lobster rolls before and this was on the smaller side. The bread was buttered and greasy and the lobster was buttery. Who wouldn't enjoy that? $17 for a roll.   The lobster Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite. The cheese had a fake taste like instant Mac and cheese type taste. $12  I'm guessing if you're on the strip and drunk willing to blow some money or you just happen to be there and you were hungry, you would probably enjoy your meal. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",

When I saw that gold sign I swear I squealed like a little piglet!    lobster grilled cheese $11- so damn good. Right amount of cheese with the right around of lobster! It had different cheeses inside & not just american.   Lobster Mac & Cheese $12- this was the highlight of my day! I've been wanting to try lobster Mac & Cheese forever. It was so delicious with so much lobster meat. It wasn't dry or overcooked which was perfect! It is a little portion but I think it was a good amount to be shared by 2 little girls like us.   I want to come back and try everything on the menu. So, see you soon lobster me!",

The restaurant is located in a mall connected to Planet Hollywood hotel and it does not offer any table service. Customers order at the counter and then pick up at the registry when called.   The menu of lobster roll is simple but offers good varieties. My favorites are the Maine Lobster and Cajun lobster roll. There are generous portion of lobster meat inside each roll and the bun is super soft and served warm. Standard lobster rolls come with coleslaw as well.  As for prices, lobster roll is around $19 each, which is OK considering it is Vegas. I find one lobster roll may not be filling enough for dinner and you may need to supplement the meal with fruits/salad/soup to feel full.   Overall, a decent place for Lobster roll.",

It's located in the Miracle Mile shops, which is a great place to shop, eat/drink off the strip, or just people watch.  The manager, was very nice I'll add, and offered my man and I, a sampling of the New England Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque Soups. The NYCC, was OVER salty. My gosh. A tad too overpowering, for the basic taste that soup can offer. The Lobster Bisque was good, but not comparable to seafood restaurant quality of course. Both were at the right temperature.  We decided to split a sandwich and chowder fries. The sandwich had about 5 large pieces of lobster chunks on it and the bread was toasted and seasoned. It just didn't have enough sauce, the lobster could have had some flavoring or be butter-dipped and the fries were just okay, with the sauce/dip kind of thrown atop, but mainly coating just a few of them on top.  We left somewhat bummed, especially at the price and despite the long line, but I did hear the Lobsicle and Lobster Grilled Cheese Melt, are pretty tasty.  I just don't foresee returning, at this point.",

Must say the presentation looked delicious, and the staff was very friendly. I ordered the main lobster, the surf n' turf philly, and the lobster Mac and Cheese. All were just ok, but ended up spending over sixty five bucks. Quite pricey for food that I was not too crazy about.  Huge let down. Waffle fries were okay, but as soon as they get warm, it loses its crisp which is the best part. I also went late at night right before it closed which is convenient that it opens late on Saturdays (midnight), but again, totally not worth it. Maybe my expectations were too high. Brought it back to hotel to eat in the room. Walked about 8 minutes before I actually ate it. Maybe would've been better if I ate it there while hot. Can't say for sure.",

I've actually had some off the food trucks in Cali and really enjoyed them.  So I was eager to try the one's here.   Combo Lobster roll with Garlic Tater Tots ~ <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#2Lng3Y1DRRiTZgwO36aW_A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lobs...</a>  They offer 2 sizes medium or large.  I went with a medium and I have to say it had a decent amount of lobster meat in it.  The roll was buttered and grilled up on both sides.  It was perfect meat to bread ratio.  I went with the original flavor with a touch of mayo and lemon.  The menu only listed garlic fries but I like tots so I asked for switch-a-roo and asked for my tots to be married with garlic.  Here is my close up of the lobster seconds before it was consumed <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-las-vegas#yWfRR2jZGPrkV1wMVUNebQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lobs...</a>  Ladies there is no pretty way of eating these so just shove it in your mouth and enjoy!  Worry about the mess later LOL!  It can get pretty pricey depending on what you order.  In the end it is lobster meat that your getting.   Eyes ~ Oh Lobster Meeeeeee! Nose ~ I smell a hint of garlic from my tots!. Ear ~ Peeps walking by. Mouth ~ So very very good!. Tummy ~ Satisfied!",

The succulent mighty of crustaceans!  Browsing in the Miracle Mile Shops inside Planet Hollywood for the shopping adventure, this little eatery called \"Lobster Me\" got me intrigued to stop by and dine for my northeastern hunger for lobster, which is one seafood I favor. To lobster lovers, this may just be the place to dine ala fast food. A cozy group of tables and chairs are set up in front of this eatery, where I may add is a good place to just take a slow and easy time to eat and watch people, er shoppers, as they go passing by.   A variety of 'World's Best Lobster Rolls' to choose from ranging from spicy, cajun, BLT, lobster with seafood, or the southwestern shrimp roll. The Lobster choices range from 'Large' to 'XL' ( Extra Large). Dish out less than twenty dollars for the 'Large' roll size of more than a pound of lobster meat while dish out over twenty dollars for about two pounds of lobster meat in the 'XL'. The \"Original ME Style Lobster Roll\" is the traditional Maine, New England sandwich. It looked mighty enticing as seen as a sample roll displayed behind the glass-walled food cubicle and so, it beckoned for an order of it. It's about a large lobster claw meat and chunks of lobster meat dressed with a dollop of mayonnaise and lemon in a spicy mixture on a slightly crunchy bread roll. Tasty! hmm,soar to New England! Should try \"The Diablo\" for the spicier tasty roll. aaah, dream of dripping in warm sea water! For soup cravings, there's the \"New England Clam Chowder\" or the \"Lobster Bisque\" soup. Ha, could be listening to ocean waves in the distance. Glancing up to the menu, find a cocktail 'Lobster Shooter' or 'Lobster Shooter with Vodka' or opt for the beer. Okay, so get that little seasick effect. If you are a late morning riser, fret not, because a Breakfast Menu is served as well...lobster with eggs, with waffle, with MEmuffin, with tater tots. That is coool! eat breakfast any time. There's lobster grilled cheese, lobster mac and cheese, lobster and chips, and 'The Lobsicle', that is lobster tail on a stick. Feeling like caught a lobster by a stick spear. Oh, there's salads and, and, ice cream. Yes, ice cream, I scream for it (in my mind, only, as you should know it, can't scare diners away, so can't really scream out aloud), the Lobster Ice Cream is a light creamy, slighlty salty tasting lobster chunkiness swathed in finely iced, milky tasting ice cream. That's it? Must I say any more, what else? but lobster in ice cream!    As landlocked is Vegas, so it is as seafaring into deep waters for a lobster dish which was just served as fast food. It didn't take me to a breezy, oceany lobster trap...aah, at least just for that moment.",

The lobster mac and cheese was alright, but void of any real lobster meat, although it was garnished here and there with some of the same lobster pieces they used in the bisque.     I ordered a long island iced tea and the cashier kept trying to push this fishbowl vessel on me.  I'm a local and I will not be seen walking around holding and drinking out of a fishbowl.

Is it the best lobster roll in the world as proclaimed on the sign? No, for that you need to literally pull a lobster out of the frigid Maine ocean and cook it immediately. Is it pretty outstanding considering it's in a mall in Vegas? Absolutely.   I've had the lobster roll and the lobster grilled cheese and both are just wonderful. In my opinion, there's too much lemon and spices on the roll, but otherwise it's perfect-big chunks of lobster tossed in mayonnaise on a hot buttered bun. The lobster grilled cheese is also excellent-hot, steamy lobster in gooey melted cheese between two buttery, toasty slices of white bread. Yum!  Food in Vegas isn't cheap, period, but if you want something relatively inexpensive that is different and not fast-food, I highly suggest you check out Lobster, ME.",

Yelp never (Ehhh.. maybe seldom.. maybe sometimes) got me wrong, this was the first few times. So me and my friend shared a soup. We waited for about 5 minutes for the soup and I was excited for the whole time and the first thing we saw in the soup was - A HAIR. It was really gross but we got over that.

I thought the portions were okay.  Would have liked two of those lobster rolls but that would have been too much.  This place is pretty special and should be given a serious look by anyone in the mood for quick and easy lobster.  My friend had the lobster grilled cheese and didn't thrill over it the way i did the truffle lobster roll.",

    "text": "I went here because a friend of mine posted some pics on Facebook and I wanted to check it out. This location is located inside the Planet Hollywood. We went on a friday night which was probably a bad idea. The place was pretty packed. We actually didn't have any place to sit when we first put in our order. We got lucky though and snagged two tables later on. Just so everyone is aware this place has very little seating. What is frustrating is you'll see one person sitting at a table not even eating and the only thing you're thinking about is where the fuck am I gonna eat this lol. I gave two stars for the food which isn't bad. I ordered the lobster and chips and I got the lobsicle. I didnt return the food because I was so hungry I just ate it. I was pretty disappointed that they screwed up my order. They don't give you many french fries so if you order anything with fries they really skimp on them. I ate my meal and I was still hungry. Luckily my sister inlaw gave me some of her lobster mac and cheese which was just ok. This place isn't cheap. The meal's dont come with drinks. I ordered a Sprite and they charged me $3.00 plus tax and it was a small cup. It's not a bad place if you happen to be at Planet Hollywood and you want to get your Lobster on but I would'nt make a special trip. One more thing, they're suppose to give you a 20% locals discount but this location didn't do that. I think it's fucking bullshit because I know they honor this at the other location at the Venetian.",

I came here because I was definitely hungry, wanted something quick , easy to eat, and most importantly something DELICIOUS!. Can you go wrong with Lobster??? Yes of course you can. But for me, I shared the LOBSTER bisque and Mac and Cheese. The Lobster Bisque in the bowl was good. I especially love the bread bowl with it. The bowl was fully edible, soft but crispy. On the other hand the Mac and Cheese was a bit of a disappointment. They totally trick you in the container they put it in! Lift it up and you'll notice that its only half the size of the container!!! WTFF!!! It wasn't even cheesy! The Cheese wasn't melty either and was pretty dry. But I won't complain, I still ate it because macaroni and cheese is still a good combination. I definitely want to try the Rolls next time ;)",

I ordered the grilled cheese... it took much longer than it should in my opinion.  My friends got all their food before me, and I ordered first.... does that make sense?  Grilled cheese for $10 is not worth it.. even if there is lobster in it.  It didn't satisfy me and the combination of fishy + cheesey did not work here.  I tried a little of my friend's lobster mac and cheese... it did not work in any favor.  It was an interesting concept, but I'd rather walk a little further to Earl's.",

(e.g. shrimp/tofu ice-cream) My mom and I happened to be walking along the Miracle Mile Shops when she saw a big sign that said 'Lobster ice-cream, free samples' so I went up to the cashier and asked for some to which she handed me a spoonful. Not bad, I say. I was expecting something bland and downright icky but surprisingly, it was pretty flavorful. The ice-cream could've passed off as vanilla, then there were the strings of lobster meat that came with it. Was a fun try. If only an order wasn't fixed to $8 and they had sizes, it would've been great company for a walk under the sun.",

The tacos are the reason I couldn't give it 5 stars.  The mac and the grilled cheese were right on the money. So good.

The lobster roll doesn't seem that big when it comes out, but it's more than enough to fill up one person, especially if you order fries as well.  My friend ordered the lobster fries and I have to say that was disappointing.  The sauce was ok and overall the fries were just soggy and not that great.

    "text": "Came here for brunch after a nice night out in the city. Have to say the food was great, but not for the price. Bought myself a Lobster Mac and Cheese for $12 and gave the Bloody Mary, spicy, for $5.  Let's start with the Lobster Mac and Cheese, although it was a small portion, it was quite delicious. However, there was not that much lobster and it didn't really add to the food itself. For that price, I was hoping for a much larger portion of food, didn't really quench my appetite.  The Bloody Mary was great, if you're a fan of Bloody Marys. It wasn't a cocktail made from scratch as I expected, but rather made with store-bought Bloody Mary mix. But hey, it was great! Can't complain about that. For $5, that's a reasonably good price. Again, wish there was a larger portion of it.",

I came here with a bunch of friends and it's basically a fast food joint where you order and they bring you the food.  I had the lobster roll with truffle oil and a side order of clam chowder fries.  Lobster roll was probably one of the better ones I've had and for $19, the price was fair and portion was generous.  The clam chowder fries were tasty.  This is something you think of doing as a kid and as an adult and the chowder making the fries soggy with bites of clam is a winner.  I was a bit disappointed that my friend who ordered the same thing got more fries than me.  Other than that I'll be looking for Lobster Me wherever I go.",

I have nothing against a change in selection, but the food quality drops with each change.  The seafood is very bland.  I have tried both shrimp (sliders) and lobster (tacos, fries, mac n' cheese, rolls).  The rolls all come seasoned so those are normally okay.  The same can't be said for the rest.  The clam chowder is the only dish that has remained the same, which I will continue to purchase.  If the clam chowder has an off day, a little salt and pepper will fix that easily!

    "text": "In a city dominated by corporate chain restaurants and celebrity-starred restaurants, restaurants like Lobster Me are a dying breed. With no Gordon Ramsay or Joel Robuchon advertising for it, its only star is... The Lobster!  Lobster Me's entire menu revolved around the wonderful crustacean that is the Lobster.  Spanning from the original Lobster Rolls to the Lobster Banh Me Sandwich to the Lobster Mac & Cheese, you can't avoid the main star of the restaurant.  My friend and I found Lobster Me after coming tru the parking garage @ Planet Hollywood. Being the Lobster lover I am, I begged my friend to try Lobster Me as well. I ordered the Lobster Mac & Cheese with the french fries (covered with lobster seasoning powder) and a fresh lemonade. My buddy tried the Lobsicle (a stick of grilled lobster meat) with the homemade potato chips.  There was plenty of lobster in my Mac & Cheese. Even though the mac & cheese wasn't one of those gourmet mac & cheeses you would usually expect at a high end restaurant, it gets the job done. I loved it, even though I would probably not get the fries in the future because it wasn't that good. My buddy raved about the Lobsicle, deeming it a masterpiece and the lobster flesh succulent.   Service was good. The employees consistently came around our tables to ask if we needed anything and offered us refills on our sodas. (no refills on that delicious lemonade). The only negative thing I could say about Lobster Me are the high prices of their food fare, considering it's \"fast food\". A meal per guest will come out to average almost $20 for lobster entree + drink + fries/chips.  You could definitely spend more money at a worse place ( I am talking to you, Serependity 3). But hey, leasing a place inside the Miracle Mile Shops doesn't come cheap!",

It was Taco Tuesday so the shrimp tacos were only $3.50 which was a steal for how big the shrimp was. It didn't say that they were on the spicy side, so beware if you're sensitive. I ordered this for kids and they weren't able to get them down. So I had to switch with the $24 lobster roll that I got. The bread bowl was soft and there was sufficient amount of soup. I hate it when there's not a lot of soup in those bread bowls.  The lobster roll was great as well. Soft sweet roll type of bread and a lot of lobster. However, not worth the price tag. Probably more like an $18 cost would've been better. I paid an extra $2 to upgrade to the lobster bisque. It was good. The broth was not thick, more of a lighter texture. Big chunks of lobster was a bonus.   The beers on tap were not really cold. I think I would've taken the cans if I had to order again. They charge $0.54 for tap water cups. But she gave us 2 for free. The food came out fairly quickly. We were in a rush to get something in our bellies before a show. And managed to order, eat and get out within 25 minutes. That was with a small line.   The tables are like mall food tables. So they're not the cleanest. But it's fast food, so you get a few extra napkins and have to wipe it down yourself.   Overall food was tasty and it served it's purpose. I'd definitely eat again.",

I especially enjoyed the homemade chips accompanying the sandwich.   The only turn-off was the fact that they'd charge for water! And be prepared to wait a little for your food. The place looks like a fast food counter but everything seems to be made to order. With patience comes good food!",

For $18, you get a 3-4 inch bread roll stuffed with lobster. For one, I was expecting the bread to have a nice toast to it because it appeared to look that way. The semi soggy texture of the bread already killed it from the first bite. Maybe it was left sitting for awhile. Who knows...

Lobster is good bc nature made a bug stuffed with delicious meat, which makes it even more egregious that it couldn't save the sad, soupy Mac and cheese it topped. An insult to the lobster that gave its life for this!  Maybe it was an off day but the sauce was thin and gritty bc the cheese wasn't fully incorporated into the sauce, nor was there adequate roux, if at all, to start the sauce.   The result was a mass of bland noodles with the occasional sad speck of coagulated cheese stuff, topped with crunchies and lobster meat. All the flavor ended up in the soup at the bottom of the container.   For $16, you can do better elsewhere.  Service isn't the greatest, either. It seems like the staff was too busy with what they were doing to be personable or upbeat.",

The rolls look filled with lobster and nicely garnished with butter and other sauce toppings of your choice. No one wants a dry roll. My lobster bisque was very delicious and had a great amount of lobster mixed in. The only thing I can't understand is why soup is so expensive in Vegas. Literally everywhere you go. The lobster bisque from Cousins Maine is $6 for a cup and $8 for a bowl. I paid $10 for a cup and it was $12 for the bread bowl.   My friend did get a lobster roll and said she enjoyed it more than the roll from cousins Maine. They are a little pricer with the option to style up the lobster roll. But I wouldn't be opposed to paying a little more knowing there are more options. The Cajun, Sriracha and Baja options are free, but you do have to pay $2 more if you want the Cali and BLT option. I also loved that they have the lobster Mac and cheese on the menu! This place is quick and easy if you are shopping your way through the miracle mile shops.",

Get ready to open your wallets up wide because it's not exactly cheap, but hey, you get what you pay for. Seafood isn't exactly inexpensive, after all!  I was in awe when I saw the menu because everything made my mouth water. My fiance couldn't talk at the time because he had lost his voice, so he went simple and got the lobster bisque ($10 for 12 oz). He loved it and when I tried it (first time EVER having lobster bisque by the way) I fell in love. So creamy and delicious. I ordered a lobster roll, Cajun style ($23) which meant there was Cajun aioli, green onions and lemon. YUM. I made that a combo and got crab loaded waffle cut fries with it.

My wife ordered already so when it came my turn I found out the onions are already mixed in and I can't have onions. Strike one. Got the lobster grilled cheese and clam chowder. Clam chowder is more potatoe soup then anything. The lobster roll my wife got the roll was stale so she just ate the lobster out of it. Strike 2. My lobster grilled cheese was literally tasteless.

It's a small location with just sitting tables outside the restaurant. Nice people servicing you. They have good recommendations.  Now for the food, I needed up with their main food item the lobster roll. Definitely pricey for the amount of food. Don't really know if the lobster really comes from Maine either. The fries, unlike other posts, tasted ok to me. My roll ended being the Cajun style. I gotta say, it was, one... pretty salty, and two... not that well stacked. Half of my sandwich was mainly bread. Taste wise, it's decent but definitely not worth the $24 that I paid for it. There was a lobster roll I got in Newport Beach, CA that was about 17-18 and that seemed still a little high, but quality was a bit better.   Overall I'd give this place a 3/5 stars as the food is way overpriced. Service is ok, the sides are fairly typical but the main seller isn't that great that I'd pay 24 again for a simple sandwich. For you to try at your own risk, I was hungry and thought lobster sounded like a good idea but it turned out to be ok at best. So for you to try and let us know. Cheers.",

We decided to try to this place for lunch one day and the food was just ok in my opinion.  We got a couple platters of the taco trio which consisted of 1 lobster, 1 shrimp and 1 fish taco with a side of chips and cheese. The food was lukewarm at its best and didn't even taste fresh. I've had better fish and shrimp tacos for a fraction of what we paid here. The chips and cheese were ok too, nothing to write home about. Maybe we caught them in a off day.",

I am now a lobster roll lover. No mayo or celery, just garlic butter and Old Bay. I think I'm in love. The Old Bay fries are also very yummy. The draw back? Customer service and employees always eating. The one who brought our food out was not only eating but speaking to us with her mouth crammed full. GROSS!!! Not only that, she always had a scowl on her face and acted like she would rather be anywhere else. Plus, a prep cook who we could see from our table through the pass through was also eating and doing so WHILE WEARING GLOVES AND PREPPING ORDERS!!  I really almost left but  my friend convinced me to stay. That grossness needs to be fixed. Also, he said the Venetian location is better all around. We will go there from now on.",

There really isn't too much to say about the food. Its Lobster done a few ways. I have tried the Conneticutt Lobster Roll, the Lobsicle and Lobster Mac & Cheese. This was my favorite of all the menu items I have tried. CT style is my favorite because it is a warm protein as opposed to cold protein with mayo in the Maine version. Butter and chives round out the seasoning. very, very yummy.  What is a Lobsicle you ask? its basically a lobster tail on a stick. You can order it deep fried or grilled. Neither was as appetizing as it sounded. Think greasy vs bland.  The Mac & Cheese I had a few bits of lobster and a soupy consistency of cheese to mushy mac. I always prefer a more al dente noodle and cheesier and drier with a nice crust. This wasn't it.  Staff, for the most part the cashiers and expediters have been very pleasant and reassuring when ordering. They will recommend things if you are undecided.  Location ambiance, well...its a food court. So,that says it all. If you are looking for upscale fast dining, this is it.",

Now for those of us who have pulled our cars over in Maine and ordered a lobster roll from the many roadside eateries, we will understand how WONDERFUL it is to find one that is so spot on and in Western US.  Let alone in the desert.  LOL  The first and foremost thing you need for one of these rolls is the bread.  I promise you, you will not find it out here.  You have to bring it in from the East Coast.  Then you need Maine lobster and Lobster ME has it ALL.  If only I could smell the Atlantic I would have been transported back to beautiful Maine and all the lovely ways they know to prepare lobster.  I have had the traditional roll and the bacon lobster roll, both were excellent.  To be honest I was not crazy about the lobster mac n cheese, but as I have said in other reviews, I make THE best lobster mac n cheese so I am biased.  Having said that, no lobster mac n cheese was left in the dish.  Lobster ME will also give you the option of having your lobster heated up before being placed on your roll.  I prefer mine cold, but if you do not like cold protein go ahead and have them heat it up for you.  Now grab a beer and savor your sandwich.  I know I will every time I'm in Vegas.  NOTE:  There is free valet parking in the garage, all you have to do is tip them.  So getting in and out of here is a breeze and won't cost you much.",

My last visit was in 2016, and alas... although they improved on the serving portion of the lobster roll, it's a little bit bigger now, the quality is still questionable. The lobster was underseasoned, rubbery, and didn't taste like anything. It had no flavor. It didn't even taste like lobster. I got the \"BLT\".. very minimal bacon crumbles. It was just so lacking all around. The lobster bisque on the other hand.. Overly salty! It was just another disappointing experience. I'll definitely won't visit for a 3rd time.",

The Maine style roll comes with chives and mayo on a warm soft delicious roll.  The roll is loaded with a good amount of lobster for what you pay for in Vegas so that's a good deal.  The chips that come with the roll unfortunately are a different story... they don't have any flavor and they're very dry.  It honestly tasted like cardboard box! I had a couple bites and just couldn't with the chips.  If you're looking for a quick bite on the strip and something different from burgers and slices of pizza you can give Lobster ME a try.",

    "text": "Lobster ME was a total surprise and I'm glad I was taken here since I was so hungry in Las Vegas!  I told my friend, \"I'm hungry.\" (This is a common scenario...) He said, \"There's Lobster!\"  I said, \"WHAT?!!#!@$#@! Take me there now!\"  We show up and I'm staring at the menu trying to figure out what to do with my life and what to feed my life with.   FOOD - 3.5 Stars: With much anticipation, I ended up choosing a lobster roll and lobsicle.  Lobster Roll - I was really excited to get this, but kind of let down. Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious. However, I was had higher expectations. The bread was toasted really well and buttery. The lobster was good, but instead of having pieces of lobsters, it had what I would call shredded lobster. There was plenty of meat, but shredded meat. *sad face*  Lobsicle - This was a surprising item. You have a choice of getting the Lobsicle either grilled or fried in a tempura batter. I decided to get it fried like the healthy person that I am. When I first got it, I was a bit underwhelmed because 4 ounces of lobster looks relatively small. After the first bite, I was like WHOA! It was so damn good and full of flavor! it was crispy on the outside and meaty on the inside. No shredded lobster pieces here. ;) LOL. I'd definitely get this again. Maybe next time I'll get one grilled and one fried so I can enjoy the goodness of both!  SERVICE - 4 Stars: The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions. Yes, I asked a bunch of questions because I wasn't quite sure what to get. I was finally able to narrow it down and place my order. I grabbed a number and waited for my food to be delivered to our table. The worker even brought us some Tabasco when we asked for some. Overall, really great service.  ATMOSPHERE - 3.5 Stars: There's not really enough seating. It's right next to a Fat Tuesday's, which always has a long line. There's only a few tables unless you want to sit at the counter at Lobster ME. So, it's hard to really enjoy your food. My group was lucky enough to swoop in and grab a table.  RECOMMENDATION: Lobster ME was a surprising find here in Las Vegas. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since it is Las Vegas. I will come back and try other items on the menu. I'd think twice about the Lobster Roll though... I'm hooked on the Lobsicle though... like madly in love. So, check them out!",

The lobster rolls came with a side of coleslaw and house-made chips. For drinks, we ordered a lemonade from here.  I was just want to say the Cajun style is a lot more flavorful than the original. The original was a tad bland. The Coleslaw was really good, I'm not a big fan of coleslaw but this didn't even taste like coleslaw! It just tasted like a regular salad with dressing. Lemonade was really good, you can never really go wrong wth lemonade.  The pricing is pretty expensive for the portion you are given, which was really small in my opinion.",

    "text": "QUICK AND TASTY SEAFOOD   I like how it's a \"fast-food\" seafood joint. Here's the goods and bads:  Lobster grilled cheese was bomb. Totally worth the price it was cheaper than lobster roll.   Lobster Roll Connecticut style: really good! The lobster meat was chunky and abundant. Heads up this roll is pretty small. Much smaller than the pictures but it's still filling. But if you're a big dude order two.   Difference between Maine and Connecticut is the Maine is cold lobster and Cont. is warm lobster in butter sauce.  Lobster Mac and Cheese: thick shell pasta, cheesy and delicious! A good amount of lobster meat.   PASS:  Lobster Bisque: more like Lobster WATER!!! Bisque is usually thicker and have chunks of lobster and veggies but this one here was the opposite. It was straight watery lobster soup. Skip it.  Blueberry lemonade was sweet and yummy!  Tip: if you add a combo you can substitute the drink for a beer for $2 more!  PS. As you can see by  my picture the lobster rolls are pretty small.  But what I'm confused about is why our rolls didn't come with the huge claw meat on top like all the other pictures show???  Manager should be alerted that this place isn't consistent.",

I did not feel the glutoney of eating at a seafood buffet and still had some leftover.   The roll was buttered and the lobster was adequately seasoned. Despite being a little soggy, the chowder fries were good. My friend ordered the lobster grilled cheese and the lobster bisque. The grilled cheese did not look as pictured, but the lobster bisque was amazing.    Want a lobster roll? Go here.   P.S. Check-in on Yelp to get a free lemonade when you order a lobster roll =)",

I ordered a lobster roll that came with fries and coleslaw. Service was pretty slow considering there was one other table of two sitting there waiting. The fries were just ok, coleslaw wasn't very good, and the lobster roll was very bland. Looking back, the guy taking the order asked what sauce I wanted on it and I said I'd just do the butter sauce to keep it traditional and let the lobster shine. Maybe this place's specialty is the fun sauce they top the rolls with because I felt like the roll was lacking in flavor. The lobster tasted fresh, but it really needed the squeeze of lemon to make me want to bother to eat it. Later both my boyfriend and I didn't feel so hot and this was the only thing we ate....so I'm left to assume it was this lobster roll.",

    "text": "Given the mixed reviews about Lobster Me, I had low expectations, but I really liked it! Yes, it is a few dollars overpriced, but given that it is lobster, I wouldn't necessarily expect fast food prices.  I ordered the combo meal, which came with your choice of lobster roll (I got the Connecticut, so the lobster was warm, mmm), fries, cole slaw, and clam chowder, as well as a drink with free refills.   The lobster roll was delicious, lots of meat on a slice of buttery Texas toast. Wow, that was delicious! Yes, I wished it was bigger, but I savored every bite. The fries were good, nothing special, but I found it interesting that the chowder was served right in the same container as the fries, which made for a messy chowder sauce. I didn't mind it, I just found it odd. The chowder was good, but I didn't taste any meat in it. The cole slaw was unremarkable, but fine.  Lobster Me offers a locals' discount, so that took a few dollars off of the total. I would definitely return!",

    "text": "After my initial review, management reached out to me to address my concerns, asking me to give the location another shot. I did not think much of it at the time, but, fast forward to a year later, my husband and I were going to be in town again and I decided to take them up on the offer. Why not?   Okay, so I think the new menu is awesome and the changes that they have made in the past year are great! The prices have increased, however the rolls are slightly larger, a little more toasted (yum), and there is more lobster !!! The potato chips are gone and the standard fries have been replaced with seasoned waffle fries and they are delicious.   The lobster mac and cheese was very decadent.  You can probably check my reviews on Yelp and OpenTable to verify that I don't really hand out five star reviews lightly, but not for nothing, I was super impressed with our meal at Lobster Me today.   My only suggestion would be to serve the lobster mac and cheese in a more shallow dish as the current serving dish is a little deep and makes it a little awkward to effectively eat the dish, although we easily solved this by pouring it all out into the larger boxy serving container that the mac and cheese came in.   I often wonder if reviews left on review sites or blogs even make a difference to the companies or if they even bother to read them. I thought it was pretty awesome to see that some of the things that I initially griped about were fixed over the past year and management actually seemed to care that a guest that spent money at their establishment was unhappy and reached out to discuss concerns. That pretty much never happens, anymore. Great to see a company with an open ear for criticism and feedback.   The changes to the menu are great and I look forward to coming back here next time we are in Vegas!!",

I realize the hefty price for \"a sandwich\" turns some folks off as soon as they walk up, but this IS lobster. Just prior to stopping in, we stop at one of the ABC stores in the Miracle Mile shops for champagne; that elevates the experience nicely every time.

Not super large, but it was fried to perfection. Their batter is crispy and not too bready. Very good! Pretty greasy though, especially if they already give you a side of butter.   Cajun Fries- Absolutely the best Cajun fries I've ever had in my life. I will come back here next time and skip the lobster and order the fries. Soo good!  Lobster and Chips - not worth it. in total, there was probably like 4 bite sized pieces of fried lobster with some fries. Pass on this and get something else on the menu that's more worth it.",

Overall, if you're willing to shell out some cash, hopefully you've been lucky at the casinos, the roll is definitely worth the money for pure lobster decadence. Fries are just mehhhhh, so maybe the tots are better.  If you're trying to take it easy on the pocket, there's also lobster mac-n-cheese, shrimp tacos, lobster grilled cheese sandwich, and ceviche.  Service is friendly and there's some seating right in front of the Lobster Me window/stand. A bonus that Fat Tuesday is literally 5 steps away from Lobster Me.",

Granted its a bit pricey, but really its lobster.  Lobster Ice Cream:  A I'll give an A because it tasted great, had real chunks of lobster in it, and was incredibly innovative.  Lobster Mac & Cheese:  A- A little too cheesy; not as much lobster.  Fries:  C Mediocre at best.  Great filler  I'll be back here.

They were not out as they were the last three times.  I am persistent if nothing else.  Since the place opened, I've been intrigued by the idea of lobster ice cream so I had to give it a try.  There is one serving size, a dish with vanilla ice cream with mixed in lobster pieces and a larger frozen piece of lobster as a topper.  The ice cream was not very creamy.  It had a crumbly texture.  The lobster flavor was not evident until it warmed a bit--they opened a new 5 gallon container--so it was quite frozen.  Now and then, you get a piece of lobster that has a salty taste.    In the end, I rate this as just OK.  It's certainly worth a try once.  The prices here are high with the lobster ice cream being just under $10 including tax.  That's a lot of froyo at other places around town.  Considering that the cheapest lobster sandwich is $17, this is the least expensive lobster treat at this place.  There are some round tables and I was able to people watch--one of my favorite hobbies on a Saturday night in Las Vegas.  The number of people buying their frozen yard and 1/2 yard drinks was funny.  I'm sure I won't be back.  This was a one time try.  I'm just glad I was there once when they weren't out.",

I'd say it's higher end fast food -- you order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table. It's more expensive then your usual fast food but is much cheaper than a sit down restaurant on the Strip. I had a lobster roll for about $13 and a Lobster Mary for $14. We shared a lobster bisque for $9.   The lobster roll was so so, the bread seemed like a folded piece of Texas toast rather than an actual roll. The lobster meat also didn't have a lot of flavor. The Lobster Mary was fun because it's served with a piece of claw meat as garnish. The lobster bisque was blah. It was too salty and oily for my taste.

I didn't opt for the lobster roll, but it looked pretty good.  RANDOM but this place showed the best customer service I had in Vegas this time around. The 2 cashiers we came across were nice and chatty (not invasive and awkward at all!) They must like working here :) =======  We got: Lobster bisque ($9) - comes in a sourdoughbread bowl and serves 2. Comes piping hot. Wish there was more lobster flavor, but hey, can't complain for the price. It was a'ight.  Lobster tacos ($14) - meh. I was trying to be a taaaaaaad healthier but regretted it right away. The lobster was kinda dry (I mean, I wasn't expecting it to be fresh.. but still - again, fair for the price) and the tortilla/salsa was pretty whatever. The salsa came in a small serving cup and was probably canned. It comes with chips so it makes it seem like it's a better deal, I didn't have any though. The portion was pretty satisfying.  Chowder fries ($7) - THIS WAS MY FAVORITE THING! It's just chunky fries with cheese and clam chowder, simple but oh, so good (not good FOR you of course..). The fries were big and seemed double-fried so it held up to the chowda and cheese. The flavor was spot-on. I would return just for this.. and MAYBE to try the lobster roll.",

    "text": "\"High prices, even high for Vegas.\"  This couldn't be more on point.  The sandwiches we ordered, The Beltway and the Connecticut, were both roughly $20 each.  Yup, each.  While this isn't totally unheard of (this is a lobster roll right) you usually get a decently sized sammie.  This was more like half a sandwich.  It was tiny! Did it taste good? It was decent.  Toasted bread, lobster and butter, just appetizer sized portions.    What was even worse were the stupid chips served with the roll.  They were completely stale.  Some tough, some were soggy, but all were downright wrong.  Just give me a freaking bag of Lays already.  At least those would be crispy.    Service was also a big downer.  The guy at the register was polite, but he kept getting corrected by the rude gal behind him.  The food took forever to come out, even though this was pretty much a pick up, fast food type counter.  There is a decent amount of food court type seating also serving Fat Tuesday, but if it's all taken, you're SOL.  You better be prepared to walk and eat, but then again, the sandwich is so small, you'll be done in about 2 bites anyway.    Yeah, we won't be back.",

A $4 upcharge for a coke and a couple of fries is good evidence of being overpriced though. I'm wishing now I would've gotten The Melt or Cajun roll. The Connecticut kind of made me wish I just went and got an actual tail somewhere. I can dip the tail in butter at least. It's important to note, I've never actually had a lobster roll before. I've been wanting one since \"Lobster Day\" last year, and I'm seriously on a mission to find another place.... Hopefully, Atlanta will do it justice.",

Not that I could anyway - we live in San Diego, where good lobster rolls are hard to come by.  That's why I googled away - I had some time, and, having spent some time in Northern New England, I love a good lobster roll.    I tried \"The Original 'Maine Style\" lobster roll, which the menu describes as \"Maine Lobster served with a touch of mayo and lemon and topped with our secret spice blend.\"  Additionally, the menu notes that \"all rolls [are] served on our toasted, New England-style, split-top bun.\"   Big chilled chunks of lobster meat, perfect claw pieces on top, the mayo, the aroma of butter, the bun itself - it was great and it really hit the spot.  Was this the best lobster roll I'd ever had?  No, but I'm in Las Vegas a lot more often that I'm in Maine, and this roll was exactly what I wanted.  This roll was also powers of ten better than what I can find in my home city.  I'm already looking forward to going back again the next time I'm in town.  Other items on the Lobster Me menu sounded great, including the other varieties of lobster rolls and especially the breakfast options, but I will probably get the classic Maine Style roll next time too.",

There are other flavors, but I had \"The Original.\"  My husband had the Lobster Grilled Cheese ($10).  He said it was pretty good.  It didn't look particularly big - about the same size as a regular grilled cheese sandwich - maybe a little thicker since the cheese inside was mixed with lobster.  It was good, and while I understand the price a little since we're talking lobster, but it was still pricey in general.  I wouldn't say this sandwich would necessarily be a future craving for me.",

I don't know if Lobster Me was using this promotional deal to get people to try their $12 lobster melt sandwich... but I took the plunge and did just that. My lobster bisque did not have any lobster in it. It was literally just seafood flavor cream soup. My lobster melt and all of the ooey gooey goodness of a melt with maybe an ounce of lobster meat in it. While the melt tasted good, it lacked the meaty lobster the pictures on the menu and website promised. The Lobster Mary, total delicious. You get a whole lobster claw in your bloody mary, but it was a weak drink. Overall, if you want an expensive 2 star quick meal, this is the place. I'd say save your $30 and pay the extra $20 and go to a buffet where you get all you can eat seafood.",

It just wasn't as plain as the Connecticut, although if you squeeze the lemon they give you on the Connecticut, it's a lot better. The Beltway had old bay seasoning, mayo and toasted breadcrumbs, and it was served warm. Delicious! The bun was toasted perfectly and there was plenty of lobster meat inside.

I'm taking off a half a star because while the food is very tasty, the portions are small and even for Las Vegas, I thought $17 for the size lobster roll was steep.  For an additional $4 you can have a drink and fries instead of home made chips.  The fries were good, obviously home made and not out of a package, but again, small portions.  Potatoes are cheap folks.  If you aren't going to fill the guest up with a huge sandwich and a very tiny portion of cole slaw, then at least pile on the fries.    It's very casual, in a food court in the Venetian which is fine when you just want a quick bite.  Young people waiting on the customers were very pleasant and plenty of tables around to sit or you can take the sandwich out.  Plenty of folks partaking of the sandwiches.  Didn't hear any conversation so have no idea what others thought.  Again, my only complaint, small portion and pretty expensive.",

One star for the crushed ice in my Pepsi. As I mentioned above, I only took one bite and pushed it away. Had been by myself, I wouldn't asked for a refund.

NOT because of the lobster flavored ice cream but the idea that they were serving everything-lobster.   We were so desperate to figure out something to eat really quickly that wasn't fast food so this place was going to do the job. EH. Honestly BIG BIG waste of money! I got a Lobster Salad which was $15...I expected something bomb. When the salad came out it was literally the size of a fast food salad you can get from like Carl's Jr or something. The only good thing about it was, yes, their big pieces of lobster. Other than that this was not worth it!   The people working were nice though. Their lobster rolls sounded good but after looking at the photos....all they do is drench mayo all over the lobster? gross.   Never eating here again! Not worth it.",

Your lobster comes in a roll ($19), or with fries, or my personal favourite, the lobsticle (lobster tail on a stick). The lobsticle is small but there's deceptively quite a lot of meat on the stick.  This is my new favourite takeaways!",

I'm not a huge fan of fish or lobster, but the thing about lobster is, it's not supposed to be fishy.   The lobster in the sandwich was really fishy and just didn't taste fresh. I had about 4 bites of the first half of the sandwich and my husband had the other 3 or 4 bites. When I offered him the other half...well...he declined LOL.  I gave the other half to my friend and she ate it...and seemed to moderately enjoy it I guess.  The wait was also SUPER LONG...like perhaps they had a nice lagoon in the back to actively catch the lobster...of course, they should have tasted fresher if that was the case.   I won't return.",

It tastes good but the portion size was the same length as one of the french fries so it's basically less of a meal than getting an ice cream cone.

Either they lack decency to give all customers similar portion sizes or   it's insanely overcharging in comparison to other establishments.  Fries in the combo was less portion than Mcdonald Dollar Menu so don't  expect that to help.  Would not go back.",

Since I was a first timer, I took up the recommendations of the cashier and got the lobster mac & cheese and lobster Maine-style sandwich with fries to share. Unfortunately, it was alright and did not satisfy my starving belly.   The lobster mac and cheese definitely needed a lot more lobster and the mac and cheese was too greasy and the cheese was too watery. There weren't even enough macaroni noodles to compensate for the cheese-like soup that was in the bowl. I would not recommend getting it.  The lobster Maine-style sandwich tasted like the ocean...enough said. I did enjoy the fries though! Would I come back? Maybe- but definitely not to get these two dishes.",

Not much seating in the Miracle Mile location, just a few tables that seem to be shared with the Fat Tuesday next door. Service was fine (not super friendly, but not rude either). $19 is pretty much what I would expect to pay for a lobster roll, enough meat, not the \"best\" pieces of lobster, but enough to fill me up. Flavor was fine, butter roll was tastier than the lobster. Chowder was also ok.  As you can tell from this review, everything was (ok), but not the (best). So you have to decide how hungry you are to try Lobster ME or not.",

FOOD --------------------  - Cajun Lobster Roll (cajun spices, lemon, butter, and seasoned mayo) - I ordered this one because I wanted something spicy! I made a great  choice because I really liked the spice and the seasoned mayo, but the lobster meat was a bit dry... The size of the lobster roll isn't something to rave about!  - Original Lobster Roll (Mayo and lemon with their house spice blend) - My friend ordered this. I tried and it was just OKAY!  - Garlic Fries - VERY GOOD AND TASTY! It's really worth it!  - Lobster Bisque - We ordered this for our friend, and she said it was good!  Overall, Lobster ME is GOOD. I don't think it's worth $18/roll but I'm just glad I crossed it off my list. It's not something I'd eat every time I'm in Vegas! I must say though that the customer service is great here!

Customer service here is friendly and they bring out orders in a timely manner.   Nadine C ordered a Lobsicle for $16. It's a lobster tail on a skewer. The tail was very small and we felt that it was rather expensive for what it was. She gave me a taste of it and it was SALTY! Maybe if you dunk it in the butter, it'll help with the saltiness but it shouldn't be that salty. I think I'll pass on Lobster ME in the future. Thanks for sharing and for the experience Nadine!",

Price little pricey for $24 for the lobster roll but it was delicious. The soup was great. The size of the lobster roll did not match the size advertised on the board. They got my order incorrect, missing fries. However m, the manager who was walking around asked if everything was okay. When I explained my order was incorrect, she gave me fries at no charge. Great customer service. Will Return again.",

I mean, i have nothing to compare it to, but if I had imagined the goodness of a meaty, buttery, lobster roll, this place definitely met my expectations. I wanted to try the Clam Chowder, but they sadly didn't have it ready by the time that they opened.. went for the lobster bisque, it was GREAT.",

I had some modifications to my order and the cashier was so nice and friendly to make them for me aside from free refills! My party and I visited on a Friday night and sat up at the bar area.  It was my first time eating there and I definitely plan on coming back and sharing the experience with my boyfriend who loves seafood! Keep it up lobster me!  Attention management your male cashier with the bleach blonde hair is amazing! Love him! Love him! Love him it's workers like that that create amazing experiences for tourists like me!",

However, it was a big disappointment this year. I don't know if they changed their recipe or cook but the taste is not the same. The lobster in the sandwich that I ordered was very dry and the taste was bland. The Mac and cheese that I have always loved now tasted watered down and bland. I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the past two years.",

The lobster tail was on the salty side and I finished it in about four bites!  However, it was fresh and I didn't have to peel it.  I chose the grilled lobsicle over the fried version.  It was a novelty item and I'm glad that I satisfied my curiosity.  (It was served on a bed of shredded lettuce, with a lemon wedge and a small container of melted butter.)  Next time we're at the Miracle Mile Shops, I might get a Lobster Roll. I had the lobster mac and cheese in the past and it wasn't bad.    I realize that this is a shopping mall with possibly higher prices.  That's why I really appreciate the free parking!",

Got the Old Bay lobster roll and the lobster bloody.  A-OK.  Got more bread than loster in the roll and the chips were stale.  The lobster bloody was really good. Of course they had the lobster claw as garnish (that's how they justify the hefty price tag) and I did have someone stop me as I was walking through the mall asking about it.  It had good spice and was pretty good sized.  I tried a bit of my boyfriend's chowder--really good.  This has always been a spot that I've walked by and thought--I really need to try this place out--and I finally have.  I probably won't ever buy the lobster bloody again (it was good for the gram, though!), but I will def try other things on the menu.   Eyeing that lobster mac n cheese or grilled chZ.  Not sure.

Lobster Rolls,Lobster Mac'n cheese, Lobster grilled cheese sammie,   Lobster Bisque, Lobster Tacos, Lobster deep fried, Lobster salad and what ?  Lobster ice cream( oh yes that too).    To be clear even though it's a walk up order counter, don't expect cheap prices. The 2 Lobster taco combo will set you back $17 but the are well worth the splurge for fast casual dining. Large and fluffy chunks of freshly steamed lobster meat fill the taco.  These are not \"langostinos\" or left over rubbery stuff often passed off as lobster, this is bona fide lobby goodness. Squeeze that lime onto the sweet spot of the taco with the cabbage, pico, and some of their chipotle cream sauce and oh my.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-miracle-mile-shops-las-vegas#XGE7RtVxumyCtrmgyAxwhw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lobs...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lobster-me-miracle-mile-shops-las-vegas#9yhob1WCQSRGkIa5x2RWjg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lobs...</a>  Surprising to say the least. I wish I had a bigger appetite when I was there but this was mid afternoon, pre-dinner snack that two of us shared and it was perfect.   I will go back and try the other goodies next time I am in town. Wonder when these are gonna make their Cali debut?",

    "text": "We ordered the lobster roll. It was delicious. The toasted bread is flavorful. Cole slaw was meh, not good or bad. I am not a slaw eater so can't tell either way. It wasn't soggy or overwhelming. The fries were delicious. I didn't even use ketchup. It's fried golden crisp and had a nice flavor of salt and other ingredients. There are chunks of lobster in there. The sandwich is kind of small for what they are charging. Maybe they can make he roll bigger and add some other filler in it like zucchini or something. It's $21 for the sandwich so it's not cheap when Chipotle is $7.50 for their bowl. Soda will run you a couple bucks but they have free refills. They are busy so you have to wait for them.  I think they should just place it in the front counter and let customers help themselves.  Service is friendly. They bring the food and drink to you even. It's 5 foot away so we could just as well do it ourselves really. The better half was waiting for their food truck last year and they never came. Unfortunately, I was with her that time and we ended up ordering some other trucks meh sandwich.  I managed to snap some pics of the menu if you want to see pricing. There's a locals discount too btw. But I would not come back just to eat here again. The strip is busy and it's a bit pricey.",

This lobster was pretty bomb though and there were pretty decently sized chunks of meat within the fried pieces of lobster.   The main thing I disliked was the location.

I've tried some of there other menu items but nothing is as good as that lobster roll. It also gets bonus points for being right next to Fat Tuesday. You really can't lose with this one.",

The lobster chunks were good but for $17 I would expect more than 3 bites folded in 1 slice of regular bread.  Pros Convenient location  Cons Size Portions Size Portions Cost Cost  Do NOT recommend.

It is an interesting location for a restaurant such as this, but whatever works. It was close to 10pm and I expected a moody employee who was done for the day, but when we got to the counter we got just the opposite. The girl working the counter was very friendly and sweet.; we joked, made small talk about Yelp and she offered some suggestions. Kudos for great service! We opted for the Lobster Bisque and a Lobster Roll to share. The bisque was served in a bread bowl and was nothing short of absolutely delicious. The lobster roll was very good as well - they did not skimp on lobster at all! The price with tip for those two items came to be around $31 which was not bad for the quality and quantity of the food there. but it is still relativley pricey. And of course, can't forget the great service.",

    "text": "Firstly I would like to start out by apologizing to the lobsters that have died an unworthy death in vain for this place. The lobster meat here just does NO justice at all. God where do I start? The meat is dry and tastes like it has been frozen for months, and i dont mean the good frozen with Idina Menzel, the only thing this place \"let go\" of is their quality.. And for their stingy portions, I would rather get better quality at a fine dining restaurant for cheaper. We ordered the Connecticut lobster roll which was $17 and 5\" long.. Roll was dry and stale, not buttery fluffy or light like it should be. Soup was average and served cold instead of warm not like it was supposed to be, and the bread bowl?...yes you guessed it, stale and hard! I understand escalation for being near the strip but $17 for 5\" of trash given in worse portions than the meals handed out during the holocaust is just cold.. Sorry, was that joke in bad taste? Not as bad taste as lobsterme. This was the most expensive lobster roll and at the same time the worst I ever had, I'm heart broken at this. Dont be fooled by the yelp pictures, most are a year or older before portions were $6 for costco free sample sizes (literally that is the equivalency if you size it down). I wish i could give 0 stars.. RIP lobsters who died in vain for lobsterme, may heaven grant you a better roll with fresh ingredients to rest upon..",

    "text": "This will go down as one of the best splurges ever in our many years of food exploits. I was so curious about trying the lobster roll ever since we noticed this place opening last year (never had one! seen them on the food channel on DDD though, so was familiar). Enter last friday when I was entertaining the idea of places to check out this weekend. I had my mind set on this place. I kept talking to my husband about it and we had a nice build up. I was hoping to have it yesterday, except we had spent some time on the east side with my in-laws (translation: we were out all day), that we decided it would be today. Yes, finally, today. Can you feel my anticipation?   Lunch was relatively empty for a sunday though there were lots of characters passing by (the people watching). There are about 16 tables about five feet away from the restaurant. You order and pay at the window. Ok, a short feeling of sticker shock, over $50 for two combos, the XL Lobster Roll, fries, and a drink. I inquired about the Lobster Ice Cream and the cashier gave us each a sample. Nice surprise, because we didn't ask, but that was nice of her. It was different (not that bad, actually, though my husband made a face suggesting he didn't like it), and now we can say we've tried it! A short wait later, another nice lady delivers the food to us, and what a picture! The nice server brought us lots of ketchup, napkins, and plastic utensils. She also cleaned up when we were leaving.    The lobster meat (claws and knuckles) on both sandwiches was very generous, and the mayo was light and the seasonings were just right. The bread was lightly buttered and was toasted enough for a light amount of crustiness. (I hate when the bread is soft and gets squashed up.) Also, the bread was not heavy, making the lobster the main attraction (as it should be!). It was the perfect balance. The lobster meat was sweet and fresh tasting (no smelly fish smells here), there wasn't a whole lot of mayo (hate when it's mayo overload, gross), it was delicious!!! Usually, I eat pretty fast, but I went really slow, because I wanted to savor it. In fact, my husband finished his sandwich before I did. I got a few small pieces of shell, but it really wasn't a big deal. The fries were skin-on, thinly sliced steak fries, seasoned, and crisp. The fries were flavorful, but the portion was very generous, so I didn't finish it. Drinks are free refills until 11 pm.   We both really enjoyed it. It's such a nice thing when a place lives up to your expectations. Yes, it's not cheap, but it's lobster from Maine, people! And yes, people passing by will stop and stare at your food, but who cares, I was so into the food, I wasn't even noticing them. I was so happy to have finally had a Lobster Roll, it was food bliss. It is worth the $$$. Take a to-go menu (no prices) and plan the next meal here. Afterward, some walking around the mall was in order, as we were both satisfied, and fully nourished.",

The mac and cheese with lobster on top was delicious and a huge portion for $11.  The service was polite and friendly, but the preparation time was a little slow, and I had to fight for a seat in this mall atrium. They could use a few more tables if the mall will let them have it. Especially since people buy buckets of beer there and sit in place for a few hours.  I'd say though, spring for the lobster roll. It is worth the extra 5 bucks over the other things on the menu.   I just like saying the word lobsicle. Can you blame me?",

It tasted like the ff and the fish had both been deep fried in the same oil. After eating two of the triangle fish nuggets I gave up and stared at my girlfriends roll. -1 star  Next time I will stick with what they do best  The boards were easy to read above the walk up and order counter but they have limited seating. If you stick to just ordering a roll you can forgo a table and sit on nearby benches.   Overall pretty good, I will be back and can recommend this as a good spot to fix a lobster roll craving in a hurry!",

It comes with a side of fries and a drink, but we also got the mac-n-cheese and clam chowder. All of which was over $40!!!   We couldn't finish it all, it's heavy in the stomach! Ohhhh, FYI: one thing that sucks is you have to fight for a spot to sit at cause it's in the middle of the miracle mile and they don't have enough tables and chairs for all their customers.",

    "text": "I'm a lobster fan, just lobster in general.  When I had found out that this place existed, I knew it was over.  Could there be a little more lobster ?! Yes, but then again, I want it all.  It's at a good price point for what is offered on the strip.  Staying on the Strip or eating on the Strip, it will cost a few nickels more as opposed as to eating from some location elsewhere.   I'll admit, I have been going here everyday since I've arrived.  The lobster is fresh and service is pretty decent.  There's a little wait depending on the time of day, but it's well worth it.  Their fries are deliciously twice cooked so you get that extra crunch in each bite.  I liked the lobster rolls, but since there are many-few options on the menu, I'm trying to try them all.  It's a small feat indeed.  Their lobster mac and cheese is simply delectably delicious as well as their lobster mac and cheese fries!  Service is friendly, great product.  If you're on the Strip, stop in for a bite.  It hasn't failed to please.",

I ordered The Original Maine Style (chilled lobster meat) and my friend ordered the Connecticut (warm lobster meat tossed in melted butter).   The bun was warm and toasted but not too crispy (and not burned!) and the lobster tasted fresh. The spices they used added to the roll, the perfect touch!   My only complaint would be the price, but I was expecting to be paying a little more because it is lobster after all!",

It may be a little expensive but for it's price of $19 the roll already comes with coleslaw and chips, but this was before. Now the menu still has the same price of $19 but this time no chips, only lobster roll and coleslaw - for the same price of $19. Really? It did said on the menu board though that the roll is served with pickle and coleslaw, but when we got our order there was no pickle - only the roll and coleslaw. But even with the pickle replacing the chips, it's still not worth it's price anymore. BRING BACK THE CHIPS!!!",

    "text": "gf and I hit Lobster Me post-Meatloaf concert.  I was kinda surprised it was a \"fast food\" styled place where you order at a counter, sit in an open table area and then they bring the food to you.  We ordered the lobster roll ( medium - $18), Lobster Grilled cheese ( I believe it was $13 ) and lobster mac n cheese ( dang, I was tired - I forget the price but I'm guessing $15 )  Glad I bought a large can of Corona ( $10 )  - I just about killed the can before the food showed up.  The verdict - not bad.  The roll was very basic - grilled roll and chunks of lobster saturated in butter.  Decent serving size.  Lobster was tender.  Lobster mac n cheese - I liked it;  gf didn't.  She felt the lobster should have been cooked into the mac n cheese.  my response, \" Why?\"  I've commented on other reviews I question the combination of mac n cheese and lobster ( I feel the lobster gets \" lost \" in the cheese ) but I felt this serving was decent.  I do agree with the gf that the mac n cheese probably would have been better with a sharp cheese, but again, this will probably result in the lobster getting lost in the shuffle.  The lobster grilled cheese , well.... same principles as the lobster mac n cheese - too much cheese means less lobster flavor so why bother.  Still, not a bad sammie.  Not sure I will eat there again if so, i'll stick with the lobster roll.  pics included",

I would say it was a very good grilled cheese sandwich! It's located in the middle of the Miracle Mile Shops and is more of a food court type of establishment. The service was good but what really kind of confused me is that all the condiments are kept behind the counter. I was like, can I have some ketchup, can I have a napkin, and can you refill my water? I got up like 5 times for my requests. When I finished my sandwich I wasn't sure what to do with my trash. Do I bring back or put it in the little trash can? They eventually came and picked it up for me. I sought this place out and with parking and the walk; I probably walked off the calories I ate. Lol.. Is it a fine dining experience?  No!  Good value for what you get? Pretty close. Would I come again? I suppose if happened to be walking by. Definitely not worth the hunting I did to seek them out, so I'm going with a mid-grade review.

We ended up ordering a lobster grilled cheese sandwich and a lobster roll (photos are included).  The lobster roll was small but was very good.  The grilled cheese sandwich was also good but was a little bland.  They had tapatio sauce to help spice it up.  Over all for a lobster roll, and lobster grilled cheese, and 1 drink, the total was a little over $30.  It was a good place to munch while you are shopping.  Other items on the menu included lobster mac n cheese and lobster soup in a bread bowl.  What I did not like about this place was the wait literally took forever.  I also did not like that it did not provide enough places to sit down.  This was a good place to grab something good and go.",

In any other city in American the price would make the fast food comparison laughed but in Vegas its not bad.  I wish it stayed open later but I dig the idea.  They have a couple of different styles of lobster rolls.  It comes down to what you get it tossed in.  I got the cajun so it was tossed with some cayenne/lawryish type dust and was really good.  I know with seafood the closer to the coast the fresher and all that but as a semi late night snack after gambling, this did the trick.",

How do the rolls compare to the ones I've tried in Boston/Maine recently?  Here's what I ordered : \"Maine Style\" Lobster Roll ($17): Touch of Mayo, Lemon, and Secret Spice Blend. This is very good! More seasoned than the ones I've had on the East Coast, but very flavorful with sweet and tender Lobster!   The others I have tried are all pretty simple and plain...just butter and maybe a touch of mayo.  You don't need much more than this to have a great roll!  But Lob ME does a nice spice/rub on their lobster, that adds a great taste to it, without being too distracting.    I saw they also have a cajun rub, which might be good...gives me a reason to come back and try it!  It might feel a little expensive at first, but these are actually cheaper than most places on the coast (avg was $20-25), even during lobster season!!  The fact that it is located in the center of the strip as well, makes the price seem very fair IMO!  Check it out and see for yourself :)  Pic :",

A small sandwich, for sure, packed full of sweet and salty lobster, and guess what? I don't even like lobster. (crab legs for the win!) But this sandwich I love and I would eat it again in a heart beat (if I was rich).   Now as much as I promote their rolls (specially their Maine roll?) their lobster mac and cheese is left to be desired. Tasty and cheesy mac and cheese with the tiniest bits of lobster.

Its located in the middle of the Miracle Mile Shops. The staff was friendly and helpful. The prices were high to me, in relation to how you could pay the same amount and go to a buffet with tons of seafood.   I must say I was disappointed with my meal. I chose a large original lobster roll with fries and a drink which was $21.62.   I love fries but not these.  The fries tasted more like fried batter than anything else. I opted for the original Maine style lobster roll  which is lobster served with a touch of mayo, lemon and secret spice blend on a 6 in New England style split top bun. The lobster was tasteless to me. I couldn't taste any flavor, not even the mayo. It just tasted like lumps of cold lobster and to me, lobster has to have some sauce or of course butter to enhance the flavor.   Maybe I just didn't try the right dish, who knows. Unfortunately for this place, service doesn't keep me going back to a place (it does help of course) but the product itself does.   I satisfied my curiosity but not my tummy.",

I expected a smaller portion after being warned but was assured that $19 for a lobster roll,  chips, and slaw was worth it. I added the $4 to make it a meal which includes fries and a drink. The fries were the best part of the meal. I ordered the Cape Cod and I was expecting the lobster to be sweet, juicy, and buttery, but instead tasted just like heated artificial crab. The garlic roll was good but the lobster lacked flavor and was rubbery. The saving grace of our meal were the fries, and the lobster Mac & cheese which was reasonably priced. Overall, spent nearly $40 on a lackluster meal. Would never recommend this joint to someone. Save your money and eat somewhere else. :(",

My fiancee chose the Cajun style and I chose Classic Maine style.. I didn't get to try his (by the time I thought to ask he was finished) but mine hearkened back to camping near Bar Harbor as a little girl. So freaking good. Perfect amount of mayo, fresh lemon wedge, just a tiny bit of salt pepper and minced parsley. OMG. It even came on a toasty buttered split top bun!  The only thing I was not so jazzed about was the price. We had the two medium sized rolls and two fountain Cokes.. it came to $43. That is just insane, but I am a sucker for snacks!",

Lobster ME is due to open in Santa Monica sometime.  i had a discount from the miracle mile coupon book.  buy one large lobster roll and get a 16 oz draft beer free.  the lobster roll that was in the window was an extra large.  it didn't look that big.  so we tried the large lobster roll thinking that we would only get one bite since hubby and i were sharing.   we were wrong.  there are actually big pieces of lobster tail in the sandwich.  the buttered bread was slightly toasted; lobster was added afterwards.  the lobster was actually not one piece but more like two layers lightly salted and spiced.  you get roughly 1/3 lb of lobster in your large roll.  we enjoyed it very much.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6Vyp-9i1jzwK_bvisuPJpQ?select=GAo7jQGmJkSkVBQyGX72tA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/6Vyp...</a>  it was pricey but worth the try.  $16 + tax = 1 large lobster roll + draft beer(which is $4)  also sampled lobster ice cream which i disliked.  tasted like heavy, sweet vanilla ice cream with pieces of lobster mixed in.  i was disappointed that they didn't try to incorporate the lobster taste into the actual ice cream.  felt like they could have tried to infuse flavors.",

I've tried the Maine and Connecticut I liked those the best. It's Simple; a little mayo, melted butter, special seasonings, and a squeeze of lemon. The truffle roll is good, but the truffle aioli overpowers all that lobster goodness. Lobster grilled cheese had too much cream cheese. The soups here are ok, doesn't really taste fresh, but it comes with a bread bowl and its the cheapest thing here ($7), they have clam chowder and lobster bisque. Place gets pretty pack and there are only a few tables so get it to go.",

We shared a lobster roll and it was worth the $23, except that they need to drizzle some hot drawn butter because it was a bit on the dry side.  If you're feeling a bit bold, feel free to try their lobster ice cream!  I really wished that I had the chance to try their lobster bisque in a bread bowl.  Highly recommend this place whenever you happen to be in town!",

They put so much crap on the lobster that it made the taste of lobster go away.  I literally rubbed the crap off of my meat so that I could eat my sandwich.    The lobster mac & cheese was watery and lacked any real flavor.  I didn't like any of the flavors here.  The lobster was super tiny and didn't add much to the dish.  The only saving grace was the lobster shooter, which wasn't horrible.  It consisted of a chunk of lobster meat, some ketal one, and some pepper sauce or something (lol, I don't know the exacts... it tasted like a bloody mary to me).  I thought that was pretty good (and not too pricey at about $8/shot).    Over all, not the best lobster roll, but whatever is clever.",

They apologized and gave a full refund but it was a little disappointing.  My lobster roll was very meaty but definitely not worth the $$.  I'm sure this place will do fine either way though due to the uniqueness/ concept and the location.  I usually try to avoid the strip restaurants for the exact reason of being overpriced for mediocre food but its so convenient if your at the MM shops or PH.  If I'm on property again I'll probably go to Earl of Sandwich instead.",

I've tried the lobster mac and cheese and the lobsicle, but it's truly the lobster roll that I come for. For under $20 bucks I leave full but not sickeningly stuffed. Expensive, especially for a counter in the mall, but it is fresh, made-to-order lobster in a Vegas tourist trap after all. Locals do get a 10% discount with ID. Go when you're hungry, as lobster doesn't travel well--although a cold lobster is just about better than any other sandwich anyway.",

I got the large as I was sharing with the wife. The bread was nice and toasted and the lobster was great. I liked the lobster because it wasn't mayo based as people say alot of them are. it kept it light and from being too fatty and bloated.  There was plenty of meat in it to make it a meaty roll so with that I am pleased.  We also got the lobster bisque in the bread bowl $9..this was good but I had definitely had better bisque all over the east and west coast. It lacked....some serious flavor.  So final report...will I go again? maybe but definitely not going to hunt it down again.",

As others have said, it was a bit pricey but again we're talking about Lobster here folks! The place is located in the Mile of shops next to the Planet Hollywood hotel/casino. Suite #435.   I had the Lobsicle. Which was basically an amazing huge chunk of lobster fried on a stick. I also upgraded to the cajun fries, which honestly I don't remember how they were because I was in Lobster Heaven. The husband ordered the Maine Lobster Roll which was a toasted buttery roll with huge Maine Lobster claws in it. The lobster was cold, which was a bit unexpected, but who knows maybe that's how it's supposed to be? He also had the garlic fries but I believe he didn't eat them because that huge Maine Lobster roll filled him up! We also ordered a bucket of beer, because well, it's Las Vegas! All together our total was $56 and worth every cent.   I can't wait until our next annual trip back to Vegas. Lobster Me is going to be one of the first stops, perhaps before even checking in! Yeah, it's that good.",

When we passed \"Lobster Me\" in the Miracle Mile, we actually joked about the billboard advertising the \"lobsicle\". A lobster tail on a stick battered and deep fried sounded strange and intriguing all at once. On our way back through I decided to go for it adding a new tally to my fried food on a stick resume. Let me tell you how happy this experience made me. I know I know. It's just food but OH MY!!!!! The food gods have showered us with an amazing concept that has blown me away.        The \"lobsicle\" is the perfect size lobster tail speared on a wooden stick, battered and fried to perfection. It's served with a lemon wedge and cup of melted butter. My lobsicle was cooked perfectly and so tender. I couldn't believe the frying process didn't turn it to unedible rubber. The only negative I can come up with is that Lobster Me closes at 11pm and I can't go get more RIGHT NOW!!!

My son had the fish and chips, fish was cod and fries were fresh. I had the lobster/ shrimp cheveche it was okay but they mix it with mango and it made it a little to fruity. Overall the meals was good but a little pricy for a food court type meal. Good lunch spot or quick snack!",

I had the lobsicle, lobster mac and cheese, lobster bisque, Conneticut lobster roll and some tea. The Mac and cheese needed more lobster and cheese as the shells were left dry. The roll was good. The lobsicle's batter coulda used more flavor. All in all not too bad",

Since we hit the tables non stop the entire weekend, food was just a secondary thought.  However, I did want to try this joint the last time I was in Vegas so we went there for an afternoon snack.  Be prepared to spend about $20 for a lobster roll and if you have a big appetite the lobster roll will not fill you up.  But you do get a pretty generous portion of lobster on your roll and it is quite tasty.  Since this was my first time there, I went with the original lobster roll but my friend got the cajun lobster roll.  He said it was very good.    Next time I think I'll try the lobster mac and cheese..... hhhhmmmmm......cheeeeeesseeee.",

When we came, we ended up just ordering 3 things: lobster mac & cheese, lobster grilled cheese and lobster & chips. Right when took our first bite of the lobster mac & cheese, we were SO sad! The cheese had no flavor and there was very few chunks of lobster. Then we tried the lobster grilled cheese and it tasted so plain. The lobster & chips had only ONE piece of lobster but the few bites we took from that piece was good. We've tried many lobster meals and this was honestly one of the worst experiences we've had. We thought maybe we didn't experience the True \"Lobster Me\" experience because we didn't order a roll but we agreed we wouldn't even try any because we already spent $40+ on a meal that made us full but not satisfied.",

    "text": "Took the family out to check this place out after a good review in a local magazine. I have to say without a doubt this is now one of two reasons for me to hit the strip. The service we got from the staff was pleasant and they answered all of our questions. The wife had the grilled cheese and our soon had the Mac and cheese. As mentioned in previous reviews the Mac and cheese isn't out of a box. It was fresh, hot, and they didn't skimp on the lobster. The grilled cheese was warm and plenty gooey with plenty of lobster as well. I went with the regular size lobster roll combo that included fries and a drink. I most say I was a little surprised at the size of the roll for the price, but the amount of lobster in the salad and the claw meat on top more than made up for it. It was so good that I ordered a second roll.   For me the only negatives is that you share a common area with the bar next door selling those touristy size drinks in those goofy cups. The music that they had on in that bar wasn't something I wanted to listen to. Also the restrooms are a far away and the distance is off putting for us dining with a younger child who needed to use it.",

This roll was worth the $20 (or maybe it was $17). They gives generous amounts of lobster and the spice is just fantastic. So much flavor bursting in my mouth, and it didn't overpower the lobster. Every bite was much too perfect with the buttery bun it comes on... wow. If you think $20 is too expensive for a roll, please keep in mind that IT IS LOBSTER... in a desert :P Lobster Salad - Nothing to special about this salad. I wanted something healthy, but still try the lobster here. I ended up eating just the lobster and a few bites of salad, ha. Nothing too special about this one.  Service was good and very friendly. A verity of beverages to choose from. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed :)",

I dream about anything and everything with lobster in it so stopping by here was a must on my last trip to Vegas.   Too bad this place definitely didn't live up to my high expectations. It seemed extremely overpriced for what we got. And we were still hungry after.. So I somehow paid $28 for a small amount of food and I got to go back to my hotel hungry.   I'll come back to try the lobster ice cream though. That sounds super interesting..",

The Connecticut and the Cajun is a lobster sandwich which we found tasty. The Cajun was seasoned but not spicy. Definitely a different take on lobster fast food lol Now my hubby  did NOT like his fish and chips. He said it was more like fish strips cause it was chewy, tough and not what you think of as fish n chips. Def not worth the $16. Upon our leaving, the cashier asked him how he liked his food, he was honest and she gave us our money back for his food. The rest of us LOVED our food!",

    "text": "For what it's worth, Lobster Me is a decent fast-casual place to eat. I've had the experience of having fresh seafood on the East Coast, and nothing on the West will ever compare to what you get in cities like Boston. But, I believe Lobster Me tries hard to make their seafood tasty, and what they do with their seafood works for them.   Conveniently located in Miracle Mile, I was able to walk here from my hotel room in about 5 minutes. Lobster Me is an order and pay at the counter type place, which worked for me!  All three people in my party who ate here ordered the Original Lobster Roll. This was their no frills roll -- filled only with lobster, a couple of their \"house\" spices and stuffed in a delicious piece of bread. Each roll was $24. Pricey, but you're in Vegas!  Our food came out in about 5 minutes. I really enjoyed my Lobster Roll and thought the lobster was fresh for Western standards and very tasty with all the spices they threw on the meat. But, the two other people that were eating with me were born and raised on the East Coast, and both of them said the lobster was only \"ok\". One of them didn't like the spices that they put on the lobster and she even picked some of the lobster pieces off and didn't eat them. We all agreed that the bread was delicious though.  We also ordered a side of fries and we all really liked the fries as well.  Overall, just your average seafood place. Nothing special, but nothing horrible either. Check it out when you're in Vegas since it's worth at least one visit!  Cheers!",

I asked the lady if that was how big they normally were and she said yes they shrink when they get cooked .  I was mad and still hungry .

    "text": "It always bothers me when people give a place less stars just based on the price.   First of all you're in Las Vegas. They don't call it Lost Wages for nothing. Second of all it's $&@?ing lobster, in what world is lobster ever cheap? Please tell me. I'd like to live in that world.   Rant over. Now let's get to the nitty gritty. Lobster me's food. I had the lobsicle and the lobster bisque. The jury is still out on battered and fried lobster tail on a stick. Maybe I'm partial to grilled or broiled lobster but it was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The bisque however hit the spot. The flavor was great and there were nice little chunks of lobster throughout and it came in a bread bowl. I love bowls you can eat. Who doesn't? The only bad thing about this place is there's not enough seating. Even though it was very mall-food-esque the service was incredible. The people that work there are grade A, I don't think I had better service my entire trip. You go Lobster Me, you go!",

    "text": "I don't know what kind of food these other reviewers are used to eating, but I found no substance to any of the claims being made about poor taste, quality, or quantity. My wife and I ordered the lobster mac 'n cheese, a traditional lobster roll, salt and vinegar fries, and a drink. With a $4 online coupon, we got all that for $32. And after a solid afternoon of dodging drunk idiots on the Strip, we found our previously empty stomachs delightfully filled.  Both the roll and the mac had a good amount of lobster chunks. Again, I say that these were CHUNKS. It was not flaky, or fakey. Straight up lobster chunks from a real lobster. The mac was not huge, but it would definitely satisfy your average hunger strike if supplemented with a small side (like fries) and a drink. The roll was smaller (as lobster rolls are supposed to be), but still on the larger side of ones I've eaten in the past. The roll itself was like a buttered and grilled Texas Toast. It was probably about 5\" long and completely stuffed with lobster meat.  The fries were only lightly drizzled with vinegar to avoid an overpowering taste. The salt level was good.   Look, if you want lobster without the buffet price and/or pretentious ambience, go to this place. I think it's a worthy substitute for excavating a lobster's exoskeleton yourself while paying a very reasonable (at least by Vegas standards) price.",

I just remembered why I dont write reviews, so I apologize for wasting your time.  Pros:  Good food Entertaining atmosphere Dank mad nasty awesome seafood  Cons: Poor value Awkward seating I feel it would be better if it were hot lobster  All in all nothing special just the only place I know to get a delicious lobster roll",

They also offer free sample of lobster ice cream which I cannot resist. the ice cream wasn't too bad but when I spotted a big chunk of lobster meat in my ice cream I was kind of freaked out lol. so none the less, I threw out the ice cream. my lobsicle was absolutely delicious comes w a slice of lemon and sauce it was heavenly sent. Next time, I wanted to try the lobster spring roll and probably the whole menu! ;)",

Second, the wait for the food was probably about 20-30 minutes. Kitchen seemed to be a bit unorganized, as I noticed like 10 or so tickets at the window! Now for the important part, the lobster... We ordered an original lobster roll, lobster mac and lobster grilled cheese. Unfortunately, we weren't really impressed! The lobster roll was inconsistent in flavor. Some bites were pretty good, others were eh. It was also pretty small! (should not be called \"large\"). The lobster mac was, sad to say... Bland and runny. Couldn't really taste the lobster and it looked like Mac and cheese, but the flavor of the cheese was almost nonexistent. Definitely would like it to be more creamy and rich. Finally, the lobster grilled cheese was actually the best of the three, but was far from phenomenal. The grilled bread was good but was mushy. It didn't have that crisp you expect from a grilled sammy. I told my girl, the best part of my meal was my beer.   I read an earlier post about this place... It stated \"if you don't like your money, eat here.\" I wanted to find out for myself, but about $40+ poorer, I definitely should have taken that yelper's advice! Don't say we didn't warn you!",

I ordered Cajun while my hubby wanted to stick to the traditional one and we must say...we finished it in about 5 mins. The fries are okay and the service was great. The cashier Cathy was friendly and attentive even after we received our order. The location is located inside the miracle mile mall next to Fat Tuesday. There's not really an exclusive eating area but we were in and out for a quick bite within 10-15 mins. Looking forward to trying their lobster bisque and lobster mac and cheese. Definitely will be coming again.",

    "text": "Located next to Fat Tuesday in the Miracle Mile I was excited to go lobster crazy. Everything on the menu looked delicious so I gave in and decided to give this place a try...eh...I was a bit disappointed. I ordered the lobster grilled cheese and the lobster wontons. I really envisioned the grilled cheese to be made with regular melted gooey cheese just filled with lobster chunks...not the case. It was cold, they used cream cheese and it was not melted. The wontons surprised me as well because all I tasted was curry, I didn't even finish half of them. I got to sample the lobster Mac and cheese and that was pretty good, I would definitely eat a bowl of that. I also sampled the lobster ice cream, a spoonful is enough. It was very rich and buttery with lobster chunks, not sure if I could handle an entire scoop.   Next time I would go with their breakfast items because the lobster eggs and lobster and waffles looked yummy...but then again so did that grilled cheese :/ Oh, they give free refills on drinks.",

We got our number from the young girl who was helpful in assisting us since it was our first time ordering.  A few minutes later our food arrived. The  man who served it was nice but, you could tell was overwhelmed. The lobster Mac and cheese had huge chunks of lobster on top of what looked like boxed Mac and cheese with toasted bread crumbs thrown on top. It was good for the first two or three bites....after that I ate just the lobster, which was delicious! My husband's lobster roll, well he ordered the Connecticut and received the Original. I took the first bite and noticed it was cold, since both can come cold we didn't think much of it. He thought maybe they mistaking gave him the cold Connecticut. After bite two, he realised it was not the Connecticut but, the Original. By then a line had formed , I was almost done, and he had eaten a 1/3 of the sandwich. So, since it was good also he enjoyed the rest of it!  Overall the food is good and I think staff just needs to slow down a bit or hire more.",

The quality of food was relatively the same but I realized the portion of food was just roughly the size of a fist. It tasted great but I'm not sure if it was really worth it for the amount of food you got.  If you're ever craving lobster to-go as a sandwich, I'd stop by Lobster ME. If not, it's a good place to visit once, but other than that, you'd best give some other places a try on the strip.",

We went lobster crazy! The Frenchy (is the sandwich I had myself) is very light breading if you want something lighter than the grilled cheese. The grilled cheese was good too! All of it was good. Between the cheese fries and the mac and cheese, I preferred the mac and cheese. It just seemed like the lesser of two evils! Haha.

The shop is located in the Miracle Mile Shops, just a little bit up from Earl of Sandwich and right next to Fat Tuesday. My friend and I came here right after a show which ended around 11:30PM on Saturday night. The place is opened until 12. The cashier was a pretty chill and enthusiastic dude, not something I was expecting near store closing. My friend and I both ordered the plain lobster roll. I didn't even read the note on top, but it comes with a side of criss cross fries, small cup of cole slaw and half a pickle. It is sort of pricey for fast food, but it's lobster we're talking about. Presentation of the lobster was very nice, and it came with a small piece of lemon. It's not the freshest or tastiest lobster I've had, but it satisfied my craving. Next time I'm going to give the crab roll a try!",

I decided on the lobster mac and cheese partnered with the chowder fries..As I did like the mac and cheese with both tender pasta and delectable cheese sauce the lobster was scarce overall (hence the comments above)..The chowder fries were a roller coaster for me..I did find the fries the perfect consistency (not too hard not too soft), but the tomatoes that were partnered with the chowder I felt caused it to be soggy overall  All in all it was a good find, but not a great find..I will most likely give it another shot as there was their lobsicle which was calling my name, but trial and error has shown me what to omit for sure from my palette.",

    "text": "So this lobster shack/counter is located in a part of Miracle Mile Mall. This little gem is full of magical goodness for your mouth. The fried lobsicle is a fried lobster tail on a stick, served with a side of drawn butter. When you pour the butter over the tail it melts in your mouth. I had to eat and run the first night, but it was so delicious that we had to come back on our last night. I ordered the crab loaded fries, which come with waffle fries, crab meat, lobster meat, green onions, and drizzled with ranch. Smh. I can't describe how great these combinations of flavors made my heart sing!! Aaaaaahhhhhhh. We were a party of 11 and everyone ordered different things on the menu. EVERYTHING was great. I wish they would open a location in NYC!!! (Hint, hint)! The staff is amazing and very hospitable. Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "Lobster me please.  Lobster me good but please don't steal my wallet once I drift off into a coma.  It's my favorite crustacean and always more expensive than my Casio watch.  Even when I do find lobster rolls, they are without an abundance of lovely lobster meat. This place gives you a nice heaping of lobster meat at a great price, ~$12.  The quality of the lobster meat is questionable though, but it's enough for me to eat and not barf.  The lobster rolls come with a bit of coleslaw and potato chips too, so you don't need to order fries unless you really want to soak up some giggle water.  The roll is buttery and delicious by itself.  I'm sure it will be a good enough to devour in-between Fat Tuesday sips.  My only lobster-y wish is that the lobster mac and cheese had more meat in it.  Am I asking too much?!  How can you give me an awesome lobster roll and then send me a lazy lobster mac and cheese?  Okay, I'm a brat, but I still recommend this place when it comes to snorting anything with lobster in it.",

They have a lot of different things on their menu you can't find in Boston!  They have a few different styles of lobster rolls, but since I've had a few of those already, I went for the lobster mac and cheese, and Pearl T. got the lobster on a stick grilllled.   We were a little disappointed at the size of the lobster on a stick. Pretty small for ~$14 but I think it tasted good?  Lobster mac n cheeze is huuge for $12. A little too cheezy for me, but I liked the amount of lobster on top. Just couldn't finish it with all the oil and cheese at the bottom. I think this is a pretty good deal for the amount of food you get. I'd LOVE to try the lobster & waffles, but I didn't see it on the menu when we were there!   We also forgot to try the lobster ice cream, so there must be a next time! Overall, it was an a-ok experience! I'd come back if other people want to try it, but read the reviews and be selective about your choices!",

I've eaten here several times and I rant and rave about the place but now I'm stuck with my foot in my mouth. Starting with this soft and soggy grilled cheese that smells like gross ocean, and tastes like a \"old tuna sandwich\" you better not unless you want to be sick. How could you treat your local resi like this.. :(  I kind of felt like I was sold the left overs!  The mac and cheese was horrific! Watery, no cheese, \"fishy smelling\" lobster. I was in shock that I was given this CRAP! The macaroni shells and cheese is different. Also there use to be a breaded crust like topping Lobster roll also had fishy smelling meat on it. In case anyone was wondering, sea food should NOT smell fishy! Weird, yes, but very True. Shame, Shame, SHAME Lobster me NOT! \"LUCY, Some body got some splaning to do!\"  Entire staff is starving now....   2 Stars because one should mean, \"please, throw the whole business away!\"  Never returning...",

    "text": "On a trip a few years back I discovered Lobster Me, which I quickly fell in love with. I tried it again during this trip, and I'm not sure if it was me or if the chain has changed because my love for this place has turned into a like.  Now don't get me wrong, nothing was bad per se, but it just wasn't as good as I remember my first interaction. So, if you haven't guessed by the name, Lobster Me specializes in lobster rolls, but also sells lobster mac & cheese, fish tacos and other things so just because you may not be in the mood for a roll, doesn't mean you shouldn't stop by.  This location is inside the Mall at Planet Hollywood and it quickly became quite busy after I made my order.  This trip I wanted to try something(s) I hadn't had on previous visits.  This time I went with their Atlantic Blue crab roll ($15) which is wild Atlantic lump and claw with mayo and celery (this is served chilled). Now you can, \"style it up\" meaning, you can add certain toppings to it. This time I chose their baja which is chipotle aioli & pico de gallo. They have other styling's like Cajun, which is aioli & scallions. I do remember my last visit, I got the Maine Lobster, which is served with that warm butter and is always a good choice in my opinion. All the rolls are served with waffle fries and coleslaw. In addition because I just really wanted to try it, I got their mac & cheese.   The mac & cheese is what I started with first. At first look I was a little underwhelmed because I thought I'd get something truly special or loaded with cheese, but after my first bite I have to say I liked it a lot. The fried onion straws on the top were a different, but nice touch. I ate the entire thing which I also was surprised about. And as a FYI, you can add lobster to your mac too if you'd like.  Pass on the coleslaw, it was not good at all. Too dry in my opinion.  The fries were okay, but I felt like they weren't that hot. I still ate them, don't get me wrong, but they weren't the freshest.  The roll was good, not great, but good. The bread was fresh and dense and there was a ton of crab and lobster meat, but I don't think I chose the right add on for me. I didn't love the salsa and aioli mixture. I think for me, it's just better to leave well enough alone and not put anything else on top of it as these flavors overpowered the seafood. I picked off what I could and finished my meal that way.  Next time I come by I'm getting my Maine Lobster roll again. Stick to what you know, right? Overall the service was great. Everyone was super friendly. This wasn't the best meal, but I think it was a combination of my choices and previous experiences at their other location. I'll be back, I just know what to order and what I don't like now.",

It's great that we waited to because otherwise we would not have met Jean.  On top of experiencing some amazing say that we had such an amazing customer service experience with Jean. The meaning is very simple there are so many options for customizing your lobster roll and/or upgrading your side is that it can be a bit overwhelming. Jean was funny, cool and down to earth and he took the time to explain all of the options as well as give us a few recommendations. In the end everything turned out amazing!  My wife and I knew that we both wanted lobster rolls we just didn't know what toppings we wanted. We both landed on Cali Style which because we both love avocado. My wife upgraded her side to the loaded crab fries and I upgrading mind to the Mexican street corn.  The fries were as amazing as they found which was to be expected I was truly Blown Away by how good the Mexican street corn was. More on that later. The loaded fries four tops with crab meat, bacon, chives, cheese and came with a ranch dipping sauce. Oh my gosh!  I honestly would not have tried to Mexican street corn if it were not for Jean because most of the times we have had it it has been hit or miss. I'm so glad that we trusted Jean though because this was by far the best Mexican street corn that we have ever had. They use Chipotle mayo instead of regular mail and it gives it a little kick and it's so delicious.  This will definitely be one of our first stops next time we're in Vegas!",

    "text": "Lobster Me is located in the Miracle Mile shopping mall area attached to the Planet Hollywood resort. It's counter service seafood with sit down restaurant taste! I did end up getting the crab cake which felt like cheating a little since it was a lobster restaurant but I have trouble passing up a crab cake. The sauce they put on it was a little spicier than I expected, but I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to that and it was still perfectly cooked and very filling. One of my friends tried the lobster grilled cheese, which sounded and looked intriguing. I thought the waffle fries were good and still regret not trying their version of Elote (Mexican Street corn) but I had plenty to eat with just the sandwich and fries. Worth checking out, as they put an interesting spin on some of their dishes.",

We ordered the lobster roll and upgraded it BLT style ($26) and crab fries, but the real star of the show wasn't the lobster. The lobster roll was good with the crunchiness of the bread, lobster chunks, and bacon, but the fish taco ($4) was absolute perfection. It was fried perfectly and the batter wasn't thick with some apple citrus slaw, pico de gallo, and the secret must be the sauce- that chipotle aioli sauce gave it the right amount of flavor and kick. I'll take 10 please!  There is also limited seating in front of the restaurant, but it's a quick turnaround time. We ordered our food and all the seats were full, but we waited about 10 minutes and a table cleared up.",

If you can, you should upgrade your fries to the lobster bisque, it was delicious and creamy.  Don't forget to tip",

To my luck, I found it one night as my boyfriend and I were returning back to our suite and, at a distance, I excitedly screamed \"I found it!!!\".  To my horror, the price of \"those lobster-dogs\" was $20-25!!  I was horrified at how expensive it was but got it anyways.  The lobster rolls comes in 5-6 dressings and we chose Baja.  Upon ordering, we were given a small plaque that had a number and the server would hand deliver the meal to your table.   The lobster roll, although a bit small, was filled to the brim with lobster meat and dressings.  The meat was juicy and had freshness from the sea. It came with sides of waffle fries (very crispy and delicious), small pickle slices and (probably) the best coleslaw in the world (I usually do not care for coleslaw but this one was beyond amazing).  I think I was more amazed by the sides than the actual lobster roll.    Overall the food was very good but, for the price of $25, I found it too expensive and did not justify its value.",

At $ 17 for the 4\" lobster roll and $ 23 for the 6\" roll, this place isn't cheap but it is comfort food at it's near best.  Only thing that could improve is the setting.  You are literally sitting at a table just off the main aisle of the often noisy Miracle Mile Mall that encircles the Planet Hollywood Casino.  Trust me, this is not a picnic table on the coast of Maine.  The rolls are filled generously with only lobster meat - non of those celery or breading fillers...just a touch of butter and mayo to add to the flavor.  You always get the meat from two claws on top every 4\" roll and three or more on the 6\".  The roll is classic New England - cut on the sides unlike a standard hot dog bun and toasty warm from the grill.  It contrasts nicely with the cold lobster meat.  When in Vegas, Lobster Me will definitely fill the bill and put a smile on your face.",

    "text": "Always a little wary of these \"fast food\" places among malls... in this case, among the 'Miracle Mile' of shops at Planet Hollywood. But I knew I wasn't going to have time to visit the Seafood Buffet at the Rio (which is quite good), so grabbed a \"Connecticut Lobster Roll\" here.  Let me say, it was extremely underwhelming. The lobster seemed -- literally -- like they were scrapping the bottom of the barrel for lobster pieces. And it was dry, not moist & tender as it should be. I probably should be giving this place one star, not two, but am trying to be generous. And the woman who took my order was nice.  But for $17, I expect good tasting lobster. This was just incredibly meh. And I'd swear there were absolutely no pieces of lobster tail in this sandwich, it all seemed to be from the claws and elsewhere (if that's possible). Which leads me to think, this is one of those places that buys the dregs from restaurants that serve lobster tails and have no use for the other parts. I will never eat here again, I promise.",

The cashier was friendly and they have plenty of options. However, considering that it is Vegas, they have a huge price tag for their menu items. Something that cost me $12 here in Austin cost roughly $23 and change at this location. Depending on what kind of budget you head to Vegas with should really answer if you'll be eating here or not.   The food was great but for the price, you could find a decent sit down restaurant with dedicated seating somewhere else. I'll probably visit again if I'm in Vegas again but that's only because I love lobster and theirs did taste pretty great - the real reason anyone chooses to eat at any restaurant.",

I asked several people about my order who appeared flustered and clueless when I asked. Finally a girl stated, \"the cook  is making it now.\" I think they had misplaced my order until then!

Unfortunately, the food itself wasn't super impressive and it's hard to justify spending spending $15-$20 here when you can get a sandwich at Earl's for $7 without having to leave Planet Hollywood.  I ended up getting the lobster grilled cheese since I didn't really want to shell out $17 for a small lobster roll and shared an order of chowder fries.   -LOBSTER GRILLED CHEESE ($11) - 3.5/5 Contrary to some other Yelpers, I thought there was a reasonable amount of lobster in my grilled cheese. And there were actual chunks of lobster instead of just all shredded. The bread was buttery but lacked the crispness from perfectly toasted bread. The cheese was warm and melted for the most part, but the texture was a lot creamier than I expected (like mayo or cream cheese) rather than gooey.  -CHOWDER FRIES ($7) - 4/5 Thick fries with a generous topping of chowder, tomato, bacon, cheese and parsley. Fork needed though because the fries get kind of soggy and aren't sturdy enough to hold up the chowder and toppings.",

Lobsicle, Maine roll, cajun roll, lobster mac & cheese, lobster & chips, and a couple others I don't recall. (Clam strips were on the board, crossed out.)  I had a lobsicle and lobster & chips. The dishes are very similar--both come with fries. Lobster & chips has lobster nuggets, while the lobsicle is a solid piece of meat on a skewer (a small whole tail?). The amount of meat is about the same in each dish.  The nuggets were a bit chewy but tasted good. The lobsicle was the clear winner, and came with a tub of melted butter.  I enjoyed the fries--nice crisp outside and fluffy interior, with skin on.  I'd call the portion and price reasonable for lobster. I'd eat there again.  Just wish they had salad on the truck.",

BF said his roll was okay, nothing extraordinary, but the size was disappointing for a XL. He said he'd probably need two or three to be full. I think i'd need a XL next time to be somewhat full.  They should really post up the sizes og the rolls so people know how much to order.  I was also disappointed that they didn't have the Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche. I really wanted to try that but the worker just said, \"we don't have that today.\" If you don't have it everyday maybe you should specify that on the menu! Just sayin...",

The best part is that it is right besides Fat Tuesday so while they are making your food you can grab a drink.  I visited here twice during my weekend trip, it was that food.  The lobster roll is really amazing.  For $16 its a small portion, but its delicious, and generally lobster rolls are not cheap!  The lobster mac n cheese was my least favorite.  The cheese they use is way too sharp.  It completely contrasts the delicate flavor of the lobster.  I was really disappointed in that.  I also tried the lobster grilled cheese which was good as well.  Their lobster bisque is extremely rich.  I would recommend taking a sample before buying, it was not for everyone.  They also had some fun things on the menu like lobster and waffles, lobster lollipops, lobster and tator tots...all kinds of stuff.  I will definitely be back the next time I am in Vegas!",

I honestly was expecting more, but I really shouldn't have from what is basically mall food lol.  The lobsicle was kinda small and a little chewy and fishy. And SUPER greasy. Not worth the 14 bucks imo... (I wouldn't have been able to tell if it was a giant prawn honestly)   The classic lobster roll however was SO yummy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The roll was toasty and buttery, and it was heaping full with lobster (I had to pick some pieces out before i could even pick it up and eat it) However, I have never had a lobster roll before so I have nothing to really compare it to haha.   The green salad with lemon pepper vinaigrette was expensive and a waste of my money. 8 bucks for some lettuce a few cherry tomatoes and some oil to pour on top. Pass.  My sister said the fish and chips were delicious, but nothing like we get out here in California on the coast. She said it was Vegas-good (ha!)  It was yummy, but expensive. Almost 60 bucks for our meal. We will probably not go back.",

They had all sorts of lobster! Mac n cheese lobster, grilled cheese lobster, lobster roll, lobster bisque. Love all the selections! The Mac n cheese is good but I kind of got sick of eating it after a while. However, the lobster roll was really good! For $20, it included a large size lobster roll, fries and a drink. The lobster roll did not look big at all, but it was enough for 2 people to share.   Anyway, I can't wait to go back again!",

I dont think its freshly made, so couldnt understand why it took so long. Overall this will be a must go everytime I visit vegas!",

Unfortunately we were starving when I decided to overlook prices. $18 for two lobster tacos and I think fish tacos were $12 or $14 with only a few chips. I was hoping to have the best lobster and fish tacos of my life at that price. Well, I was definitely disappointed. Go to Baja Fresh or rubios and get better quality,beans,and rice cheaper. Just way over priced for so so taste.",

I had to try it, even for $14 - heck, that's less than the cost of one hand of Blackjack and seemed like a sure bet to me.  I had to wait a few minutes - a good sign they were cooking it up fresh - and then they called my name and I picked it up.  So it's a small lobster tail, lightly battered, fried, and served on a stick.  4 bites in all, but super delicious, nicely cooked, tender and juicy.   Next time I might have to double down on that one.",

I was afraid they would be skimpy with the lobster, but there was plenty of it on the two dishes. Yes it can be pricey but it was well worth it. They have a lot of other things on the menu that I would love to try next time I'm in town: Lobster & Waffles, Lobsticle (lol) and maybe even the lobster ice cream! :D Definitely yummy food.

Mind you, I'm not going to eat anything like sour cream and onion flavored crickets (which are quite horrifyingly real, and I saw a pack of some this week), but I'm pretty open.  Cue Lobster Me.  I love seafood quite a bit, and have been wanting to try this for months, but I started normally with their lobster bisque.  Served in a bread bowl, and chock full of yummy lobster meat, I devoured it, and quickly.  It was quite good.  Then came the \"weird\".  Lobster ice cream.  I know.  Fish and ice cream.  It doesn't sound like it would be a good combo.  But it was actually very sweet with just a hint of a salty aftertaste.  And there are decently sized chunks of lobster in the ice cream, but they aren't \"fishy\" or overwhelming in flavor.  Meal selections seem to be about $8-10 an item, so select a choice or two and go (sharing works, too).  I want to try their lobster mac 'n' cheese next, and a few other menu choices.  Not a regular dining selection, but a returnable venue for me.  The concept may not work for everyone, but I had fun trying something that made more than a few friends raise their eyebrows at me.",

I have always had nothing but a great experience here until last weekend. The employees should really wear name tags so we know who it is that was rude. They were clearly understaffed and overwhelmed. And the young girl with the dark hair just could not handle it.

They share seating with Fat Tuesday and other places, so we kind of had to wait around to get a table. Also the tables were dirty... But I expect nothing less from a mall restaurant in Vegas haha.

The mac & chz itself wasn't all that great either. It tastes like the premed Bob Evans mac & chz you buy at the grocery store that you just pop in the microwave.  My friend got the lobster roll, I forgot which one It was. The roll was literally like 3 inches long. & about 2 oz of lobster chunks.

Ate here twice in one week as I was staying at Planet Hollywood for work and LobsterMe was a short and convenient walk. After an underwhelming experience on Day One, I figured I'd give it another try later in the week.  I ordered the crab roll the 2nd time around and it was \"okay.\"  At least it didn't taste like old seafood.  The one thing I did enjoy from here was the fries. So, they've got that working in their favor, right?  Also, employees are nice so that counts for something.",

On one of my many weekday business trips to Vegas, where I usually stay at Elara (formerly PH Westgate), I was searching for someplace close to get some dinner to take back to my hotel room (where yes, I would be working, picking up where I left off when I left the client office). While wandering around the Miracle Mile, I found Lobster ME and tried their Original Maine Style lobster roll to go. OMG, so filling and so good. Definitely a nice change from the sandwiches and other quick style food to go. A little pricey at $22, but luckily it came reasonably close to my per diem for dinner. =D",

At first glance I was unhappy with how small the roll was, but all that seemed to go away after my first bite. The spice and flavor hits you right away and all you realize is that you just took a bite of heaven. The buttery roll just made each bite flavorful and juicy.  Lobster Cheese Fries: Fries covered in lobster bisque, then topped with lobster meat and cheese curds. The bisque wasn't as flavorful as the roll. The lobster meat was limited, and the cheese curds didn't have much taste. However, it's quite a unique dish and I'm still happy I got it. If you really want some good fries, go and get the Chowder Fries. My friend ordered them and I would definitely order that next time.",

    "text": "A friend of mine recently moved to Maine and has been torturing me via social media with constant pictures of lobster rolls. Did you know, out by Bangor, they have vending machines that sell lobster dirt-cheap that are restocked daily?! That's crazy!  Lobster ME doesn't have vending machines, but they do have lobster rolls- stick to the classic Original Maine style with a touch of mayo and spices, or dare to try the new Beltway version with Old Bay, shallots, chives, and breadcrumbs. Anything else is blasphemous.   If you're really feeling daring, add on the chowder fries and a drink for an extra $6- they're like chili cheese fries, but with chowder instead of chili, plus green onions and bacon bits. They're downright intoxicating, if you have the calories to spare.  Bonus star for quick service and 20% off local discount- it's a smallish (hot-dog sized) but meaty roll for $17, which is actually on par with pricing in other landlocked states (so minimal Strip markup?), but the discount makes it especially nice. A $20 lunch, which is pretty much the minimum for the Strip, and the quality is actually really good for a food court-style setting.",

Its super buttery and flavorful. I wish it came on a bigger bread because I felt like I was eating 2 bites of lobster and 1 bite of sandwich. I need that balance....They definitely don't skimp on the lobster since you're paying $19 for each lobster roll. But when you have that lobster craving...$19 is totally worth it! Each lobster roll comes with some cole slaw and some chips. I have also had the fries and clam chowder. I think the lobster roll is good already. The fries and the clam chowder was just a side dish that isn't all that great.  Next time I will definitely try the lobsticle (fried lobster on a stick)",

I wanted to give this place more stars because I like their menu and their food was good, but it just took too long all three times I have eaten at its various locations.  During my last trip, I ordered their basic lobster roll and soup because I was in a hurry and I figured that by ordering their main items would be quicker.  Nevertheless, that didn't help.  I waited for probably 20 minutes for the food.  They could have brought the soup over early to make the wait seem shorter, but they waited and brought both items over together.  What really got me though was that the single runner they had working was busy eating his own food while about 3 other groups and I were waiting on our food.    Don't get me wrong, the food is good!  The 2 star is simply because they are 0 for 3 when it comes to service.",

It wasn't a big meal to feed two people but the lobster flavors was disappointing. My husband was like \"this is it?

I was so anticipating my Connecticut lobster roll with warm butter. But the lobster was chewy and didn't smell completely fresh.  The fries it came with were no longer the thick-cut beauties I'd had before, which were the best french fries ever. Now they were obviously frozen waffle fries, which were served practically cold to me. To her credit, when I asked for hot ones, the gal at the counter brought some to me.  Then, there was a little cup of coleslaw with it. Absolutely the worst cole slaw I've ever experienced. ZERO flavor.  In short, a complete bust for a $25 lunch. This has killed my craving for Lobster ME completely now. I mourn its' loss.",

I have not been here in at least 7 years or more and Lobster ME was delicious back then. I remember it like it was yesterday. The last time my hubby and I were here, I was not a seafood eater at all!!! He bought the Connecticut and dared me to take a bite so I did. And I loved it! He loved it too and the lobster rolls were fairly small so we ordered 2 more. One for me and we split the other. Yes, that's how yummy it was. Hot and fresh lobster, buttery, and on a real fresh and warmed up roll. Today it was horrible!!!! So bad that I literally had to force myself to at least eat the $24 lobster roll. First, they changed the roll to a Texas toast type of bread so that's a huge disappointment. Next disappointment was that the lobster was lukewarm to cold on the outside and totally cold on the inside of every chunk so I'm guessing they microwave the lobster now. It did not tastes buttery until the 2nd to the last bite, which upset my tastebuds and my tummy bec it was like eating all butter. The waffle fries were over cooked so I did not eat them. I use to beg Lobster ME to come to downtown Long Beach (until today)....I no longer will. And I will not be recommending them anymore. And obviously, I will not be returning here with so many other options in Vegas. Yuck!",

If you do order it, be sure to order a side if you want to feel even remotely satisfied. I wouldn't go back, but maybe I'm just spoiled since I live on the east coast where good seafood is everywhere.",

If you are looking for something quick to eat and do not want to have a sit down meal, Lobster ME is a great option. It is a bit pricey for counter service but it is The Strip and you get what you pay for. I am a definite believer of quality over quantity and this place is what I recommend if you want a quality quick bite.   I had the Lobster Bisque and the Lobster tail on a stick with clarified butter. Both are good but the Lobster on a stick with that butter was bomb! I would definitely swing by and pick up another one if I ever get hungry in PH.  Quality of over quantity people!!",

The lobster bisque was also very salty.   I feel like they need more mayo and seasoning in their cole slaw also. The street corn was ok kind of lacked some flavor too.   This could be because I had Cousin Maine Lobster which made my standards high for lobster rolls. So for the quality I received, the food here at lobster me was not worth the price tag.",

Lobster me was across the street from our hotel so we grabbed a bite before heading off to EDC for the night. We got togo and the 8 minute walk didn't really effect how the food tasted.  I LOOOOVEEEEEE lobster bisque so I wanted to try that with the bread bowl but I'm just not a fan of sourdough bread but I do realize everywhere uses sourdough as their bread bowl lol. They didn't skimp on lobster in the bisque !!! Really surprised honestly being on the strip and all. The bisque was more on the saltier side for my liking but don't get me wrong, it was still really tasty. I think I'd still get it again.  I didn't get to view yelp before ordering so when seeing what the rolls looked like, I was a little surprised they looked how they looked. I'm not sure how my boyfriend and his friend got full off that but they were satisfied so I can't complain. We upgraded our side to get Mexican corn and I'm not so sure that was the best decision I made. I would settled for the waffle fries but atleast I know next time !  I'd still recommend Lobster Me if someone had a strong seafood craving (:",

    "text": "Lobser ME is a Godsend if you're hungover and craving comfort food to soak up all the bad decisions you drank the night before while out on the town in Vegas.  I came across this place on my last Vegas trip after my friends and I had just finished eating at Earl's. The lobster ice cream sample sort of lured us in, but they didn't have any at the time, so we figured we'd try it next time we were here. So on my most recent Vegas trip this past weekend, my best friend's boyfriend suggested we try this place out.  Lobster ME is located right next to the Fat Tuesday place, so a bit towards the middle of Miracle Mile. There are tables located in front of it, but keep in mind, this area can get packed so be prepared to fight for a table.   While looking at the menu, I was pretty much drooling - lobster mac and cheese, lobster grilled cheese, lobsticle, different kinds of lobster rolls, and more. No joke, the lobster mac and cheese was pretty much calling out my name and saying \"eat me nowwwwwww.\" Couldn't pass that up. I ended up ordering that, along with a side order of tater tots (if you've read my other reviews, you'd know that I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tater tots) and a drink. My total came out to be $17.   My meal came out about 10 minutes or so later, freshly made, steaming with goodness. The bowl of mac and cheese itself doesn't look like much, since you pay the price of $10, but seeing that it is made with lobster, it's somewhat understandable. The mac and cheese was a bit bland in my opinion - like they should have added more milk or something to it since it tasted a bit watered down. The lobster was good though! No doubt about it. And since I was pretty much starving, I didn't really mind TOO much that it was a bit bland. Tater tots were awesomeeee. Crispy and hot - just the way I like them.   Service was okay I guess. I mean, you just order and they call you up when your order is ready. Prices are a bit much, but it IS lobster. I was already expecting the prices to be around that much anyways. Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. I probably would come back and try something else. I honestly would have ordered a lot, but I was saving my money for more debauchery.",

The roll however was haphazardly made and the filling was already spilling out of the bun when I got it. The portions are very small for the price (almost $20 with tax) - possibly the smallest lobster roll I've gotten. Yes size does matter in this case. The chips were ok - not very fresh and too crunchy  Overall ok place to grab a quick bite if you're really craving an overpriced lobster roll",

I do have to say that the salad was VERY fresh!  I'm usually skeptical about getting take out salads and ending up with old and wilted lettuce, but the lettuce was very crisp and had no signs of just sitting around in the back somewhere.  The lobster was great, too!  The lobscicles... Absolutely fabulous!  Seriously, my mouth is watering just writing about them!

While walking around the mall in Planet Hollywood, we decided to pop by Lobster Me and try out the Cajun lobster roll. We got a combo with French fries and a drink.   The lobster roll was only okay -- the bun was toasted, which was good, and there wasn't too much mayonnaise but there was a heavy dusting of some Cajun spices and scallions on top of the lobster roll. The meat went from very bland to overspiced from all the spices in two different bites. It was weird.   The fries were also only okay, but nothing to write home about.   The drink machine ran out of ice, which happens, but it didn't improve my impressions of this place, because we desperately needed something cool to drink after inhaling all the spices on our lobster roll.   I'm not sure if we'll have the Cajun roll again, but I wouldn't be averse to trying some other items on the menu.  TIP: Free samples of lobster ice cream?? I didn't get any, since they were closing up, but maybe...",

Unfortunately, I must have ordered the wrong thing because their basic lobster roll was just not up to par.  The split roll contained lots of lobster meat piled high but the flavor was just salt water from frozen lobster meat being quickly dethawed.  The lobster roll didn't taste fresh and didn't justify the price.  I may have to check out the lobster fries and the lobster on a stick the next time I'm around, but if you are ever on the east coast, try Luke's Lobster - they do lobster rolls right!",

I was saving the lobster mac and cheese for my actual birthday, but I had to eat something the night before and since I was staying at the Elara (which is attached) I thought, \"Well, I can have the lobster grilled cheese instead, so it's totally not cheating.\" The lady serving was super nice and we chatted for a couple of minutes, then my order was ready so I grabbed the container and headed up to my room to get ready for Chippendales (if you haven't been, GO.)  I sprawl all of my crap all over my room and jump up on the bed and open the container- IT WAS LOBSTER EFFING MAC AND CHEESE BY MISTAKE.  Best. Mistake. Ever. I wasn't even mad- trust.  I inhaled it. And then I went back and got it again the next day on my actual birthday and inhaled it all over again.  No regrets.  It's a little bit pricey - $13 or $14+ per entre, but DAMN, I'm still thinking about it. None of the others I have tried have even compared, honestly.  Thank you thank you thank you.",

Soft rolls and a heaping serving of shredded lobster and a large chunk of a whole single claw I believe. I also ordered the lobster bisque which was to-die-for. Creamy and warm and not too spicy.  My last visit to this spot was just the other day to meet a family member. So I ordered the Maine Roll once again. My boyfriend ordered the Lobster and Chips. We got our order and were SO DISAPPOINTED! I'd received a sad little sandwich. The meat was at least filling. BUT, I advise my average meals are child-size servings, so this was okay for ME but definitely not for the average person. The food was good but I honestly was still starving. My boyfriend Lobster and Chips WERE PATHETIC. I'd never seen a serving of fries look this sad. It looked like they threw 10 fries into the box and maybe 4 SMALL pieces of lobster tots. SUCH a waste of money. I've seen tapas plates more plentiful than this.  Overall, I will NEVER re-order again. The food was good but I spent $32 on 2 items and was not satisfied. I am always willing to spend on quality over quantity, but these items did not make rank.",

    "text": "This place will satisfy the need if you're absolutely craving lobster, however for the price I can't justify the purchase or a return visit. It's 19 dollars for what seems like a 5 inch roll which is basically lobster in toasted bread.   Most people will want a combo which will tack on another $4 which includes a small drink and a side of vinegar fries. That brings the total to about $25.00 for a standard meal. Now I know this is lobster and the location is on the strip, but for the portion and amount of flavor you are getting your money is better spent at a sit down.  On our visit we sprung for the Connecticut roll which is supposed to be buttered version of the standard roll however I could hardly tell the difference. After what seemed like 3 bites we were finished with our rolls and still had an appetite which is quite disappointing so we shared a lobsicle ($15).   It may be because it was deep fried and piping hot but this is the one thing I would recommend if you HAVE to eat here. It has some flavor and the temperature keeps the meat soft. Again, the portion is small but I'm assuming the reason you're here is because you're craving lobster right?  The overall establishment is clean, very casual, the staff members were very polite. The seating area is pretty much like a food court so you're sharing seating with Fat Tuesday customers. We went on a Saturday and there was plenty of seating available so that shouldn't be an issue.",

(Lobster and seafood salad with mayo, cucumber, celery and green onion).  I like how the roll is buttered and toasted, but I wish there was more lobster in the roll!

They liked the toasty, but soft in the middle, buttered bread, and the generous amounts of lobster meat in the center. It's not cheap -- about $18 per roll with a side of chips and cole slaw, but honestly you could probably find a lot of places charging this much for a regular sandwich WITHOUT lobster.

I ordered a roll plus soup and drink. When she asked my order, I said, Cajun with bisque and Dr pepper. I had to repeat myself 3 times and it wasn't because I wasn't clear or loud enough. Not to mention that only 2 customers in front of me took an agonizingly long time to stand in line while people are weaving in and out around me. Annoying and then to have the cashier not even able to take an order. Then the roll was only about 3 bites. Half of it was bread. For $25, I could've sat down at a restaurant. Soda had so much ice that a few long sips and it was gone. Soup is advertised being in a bread bowl but upon getting my soup, I asked and the girl said they changed the menu just today. Lucky me. Not really. Quality was ok but portion ratio to price was ridiculous and added that employees are not the brightest bulb on the tree, will not be back.  I also found out that being a local, I'm supposed to get 20% off plus I checked in and I'm supposed to get free combo upgrade. I believe that's what the hold up was with the guy in front. They didn't know how to use the yelp coupon which seems to me to be an easy cop out because so many places do the same thing.

Ordered the lobster and chips... 4oz grilled lobster was delicious... chips were cold and greasy. Hubby ordered the lobster melt... said it was great. Yelp offer of free bisque with the melt was expired but they honored it anyway... classy... except they were out of bisque so we go Clam chowder for free. Clam chowder was ok. Old fashioned lemonade was delicious. Over all, under whelming. Probably won't be back but giving high score for the honoring of the Yelp deal.",

Came with fries. The lobster roll itself came with lobster meat, with cajun mayo and spices. It was better than expected, very good for the first lobster roll I had ever had. But Still just giving it 3 stars, since the price was so high. Not sure if it was because of the lobster, but still expensive to me for a quick bite, roughly $20 for my combo. Try it if you have never had it before though, really good! :)",

The cashier was super friendly, I had a couple of questions and he didn't hesitate to answer - well no one was behind me in line. Last night, I searched Yelp for a good lunch spot here at Planet Hollywood and I swear I went to bed craving their Bloody Mary, Lobster Mac n Cheese and of course their famous Maine Lobster Roll ! Bloody Mary isn't on the menu but you just gotta ask , I got it a tiny bit spicy and it's perfect! Currently grubbing right now - and everything is amazing ! I wish I had gotten their Lobster Bisque to dip my roll in, but it's hot outside and I'm about to layout poolside . There are a bunch of mixed reviews about this place, and I don't get it. Unfortunately, there aren't any Tater Tots anymore. The quality of the lobster is great! I'm getting full off the Lobster Mac N Cheese, it's really delicious. The Lobster on the roll isn't frozen at all, kinda warm, but I like my seafood a bit on the colder side anyway. Kinda still hungover from this weekend , but that doesn't take away from the fact that this place is bomb! sober or not! Next time I come , I'm gonna have their Chowder Fries and Lobster Bisque with my Crab Roll. I love crab more than lobster - but I'd rather spend that money on a dinner buffet and get endless legs! I love seafood, and I had high expectations coming here for lunch - and they were all met! Delicious food! And extremely delicious Bloody Mary, which I'm saving and bringing with me to the pool! I paid $50.83 for these 3 items , but what do u expect to pay in Vegas for seafood?!",

I have actually been to this place 2x (I know 1 review for 2 visits = yelp suicide) but sorry it's been lost in my que for a while now..  I digress...  This place is one of the better quick dining options in the Miracle Mile. I hate to call this place fast food but it does Flt the category for a quick lunch.  I have done both the original an Cajun rolls here. My personal favorite is the Cajun. It is just the right amount of spice yin to the sweet lobster meats yang! The original is your basic lobster roll: chilled lobster meat tossed in secret sauce.   There is a third version on the menu that i am too much of a coward try; it goes by the name of diablo. Call me silly but I want to enjoy the lobster roll and not have it blowtorch my tongue while I'm eating it.   Lobster rolls are one of my favorite sandwiches but there are not many places in town that do them. So being that said I get my fix here..",

Anywho, the lobster fries were out of this world especially after I squeezed some lemon on those puppies. And the lobster rolls with some mayo packets was TO DIE FOR ...

That totally describes someone I don't know at all.   The sandwich was on a warm toast, with room temperature lobster... which is a good thing. I didn't want it chilled. I got the original which was topped off with curry seasoning. I wished the cut their lemons a different way so that more juice comes out. The lemon makes a difference! It makes the sandwich a little lighter since of course the bun us smothered in butter.   The roll came with a side of cole slaw and home-made chips, which were also yummy with a squeeze of lemon.

    "text": "Within a month, I go to Vegas twice. And within these two times, I go to Lobster Me every time. It's like the place to go for a quick lobster fix. For the price, you get your lobster's worth!   First time I went with my bf and a couple friends. My bf orders the Lobsticle (Fried whole lobster tail). It was GOOD. Like, straight up lobster. Especially with the butter, oh man... As for myself, I order the Lobster and chips. It's basically similar to the Lobsticle except smaller pieces. One thing I really enjoyed with both the order was the batter. It was really fresh and wasn't too greasy.   My second experience was my 3rd day before EDC. I order the Lobster salad because I was craving something fresh and light. I think I made an excellent choice. The lobster and salad worked really well together. On the other hand, my bf orders the Lobster Grilled Cheese. Although I did not take a bite out of his, according to him, he was full after the first half of the sandwich. He was also pretty sick of the taste (too cheesy especially with lobster together). My other friend orders the Lobster and Shrimp Ceviche. The ceviche was pretty small, but for the chips they gave a lot ...   In conclusion: I really like this place. I was not expecting an actual lobster place in the mall of Planet Hollywood. The price isn't bad considering it's Vegas. The amount of lobster they gave you is enough to compensate for the price. Also, props for this place being right next to Fat Tuesday. I will come here again and again every time I'm at Vegas :) ***Sunday special: Bloody Mary $2 for any Lobster purchase. Bf says it was one of the best Bloody Mary he's had.",

There are lots of tables in front of the shop so you can sit there and eat or take it to-go.  Food: Had the lobster grilled cheese. It was pretty good and was pretty packed with lobster, but the only downside was that it was pricey. It's expected though because it's, well, lobster. And, couldn't resist the lobster ice cream sample.. free is always awesome (: The ice cream just tasted like vanilla ice cream though.",

    "text": "I wasn't hungry.  Not at all.  I had just eaten at a buffet.  But I had to have a lobster roll... at all costs.  I stood in line and waited to order.  It's right next to the place that serves up the obnoxiously large purple plastic yard glass of alcohol slushy.  You know the drink I'm talking about?  You have to have a lanyard around your neck to hold it because it's too big and they drink out of a fat plastic straw that is never the same color as the plastic yard glass.  Well, we had to stand next to that lot of half-drunk, half-hopped-up on a sugar-high crowd.  I ordered The Cajun lobster roll and I sat down to wait some more.  By the time I got my food, I was hungry again.  The lobster roll was good, but there's some kind of optical illusion going on where there's not as much lobster goodness as it looks. The lobster roll is mostly the bun that is split open at the top, but isn't open enough for the lobster goodness to be inside the bun.  So the lobster goodness just sits on top of the bun.  So you think you have this deep bun full of lobster goodness, when really you better watch how you're holding that bun otherwise your lobster goodness is going to fall on the floor.  As I had seen some on the floor already.  The seating could be nicer.  They need to send someone out from around the counter every once in a while to clean up the tables and the floor.  Someone's gonna slip on some lobster goodness.",

The sauce had some kick and it had big, meaty chunks of lobster.  It's very buttery and basically is a sandwich made with garlic bread.  - Lobster Mac n Cheese.  This was okay.  There wasn't much lobster on it, and it was a little bland.  - Lobster Ceviche.  I'm sorry, I thought this was terrible.  The ceviche had no flavor at all; it was thoroughly bland.  I literally tried one little piece and then didn't touch it the rest of the meal.  In the end, it's kind of a fun idea, and is conveniently located by Fat Tuesday's, so it's an easy place to stop for a snack and a frosty beverage if you're wandering through the mall.  But, I would not seek it out on my own.",

I ordered their classic lobster roll, which was $17 including chips and cole slaw. Expensive by New England standards, but hey, it's Vegas and lobsters don't exactly grow on trees around here. :-)  The sandwich was very tasty, albeit a bit on the small side, again by New England standards, but it was adequate for a meal. The lobster was sweet and tender, and there was quite a lot of meat and just the right amount of seasoning. The chips tasted home made, as did the slaw. Service was fast.  I didn't try the lobsicle, which is one of their featured items (think lobster tail on a stick that you dip in butter) but some people sitting next to me ordered one and it looked yummy. Be aware, however, that it's a really little lobster tail...like 2 or 3 ounces tops.   All in all, Lobster ME delivered a very tasty, above average fast casual meal. Definitely give it a try if you're hankering for lobster and don't want to spend $50++ for it at a fine dining establishment.",

They left me on a quest to discover other places that may be serving these decadent sandwiches.  About a pound of lobster goes into each roll and yes, the prices can be daunting for some. A meal is easily $45+ for 2, but it's so worth it IMO.   Look out for coupons if you are staying in surrounding hotels or coupon books u can pick up at the Miracle Miles guest services.  The venetian location had a 20 or 25% off a sandwich and the coupon at Miracle miles included a 16 oz beer with the purchase of a lobster roll ;)",

She said it was the same price as the combo so I took the fries even though I wasn't that hungry. Came out to almost $20 after tax. It was like eating at a mall food court, but next to a long line of people looking to get really drunk.  I got the last portion of Lobster Mac around 11 pm on Saturday it seems, because people ordering after me said they were out. I thought about the lobster stick or a roll, but this seemed like the safer choice since I knew little about the place. The lemonade is much too small for the saltiness of the meal. The mac n cheese was alright, it was cheesy shell pasta with lobster chunks throughout. I'm not a big mac n cheese fan, but this wasn't bad.  The food was alright, I actually couldn't even finish it all. I ate most of it and the lobster chunks, but left a few bites left. I feel bad about wasting food, but I feel like finishing it would've made me more regretful.",

Got word from Yelp that this was a must try, so I came to try.  Tested and Approved: -Lobster Roll Original:  Had the XL Lobster Original Roll.  Delicious, but expensive for what you get. But what are you to expect for lobster?  Thick pieces of lobster inside a buttery roll.  Perfect lobster claw to top it off.  This is a must try if it's your first time here.  -Lobster Mac N Cheese:  I actually liked this better than their lobster roll.  Not too cheesy with a perfect blend of lobster pieces.   -Tator Tots:  Mixes well with the Lobster Mac N Cheese.   -Lobster Ice Cream:  To be honest, doesn't sound pleasing at all.  But not too bad, I just didn't taste any lobster since the pices are frozen.    I plan on trying other items on their menu.  Once I do, I'm sure to update my review.   Cons: -It can be a hassle to come here.  I don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.  But if I'm in Planet Hollywood, Paris, or the Miracle Mile Shops, then it's on.   -Seating: Tables are litterally the size of the serving trays.    -Price:  Lobster Roll, Lobster Mac, and Tator Tots.  Bill came to over $40.    Pros: -Lobster!!!    You have to try at least once then determine if it's for you or not.",

However, the foods in fact tasted just A-OK and prices were sorta steep.  $23 for a 6\" lobster roll was pricey, I think.  The lobster salad came with lots of small chunks of lobster meat and was good for the price.  Lobster bisque was just standard.  Lobster-n-chips was cool though! Beer-battered and fried lobster huh? Yummmmm~  Last but not least, the lobster ice cream that sounded out of the ordinary was actually vanilla ice cream with itsy-bitsy lobster meat.  The ice cream tasted alright but was worth a try!  Just ask for a free sample before you buy, so as to make sure that you would like some savory ice cream that tastes like seafood. *wink*",

I had the similar experience when I opened the box to the $19 lobster roll. I guess lobster is that expensive and more of a luxury treat.

To make things worse, I waited 45 minutes for my order--even those who were in line behind me received their food before me. This Lobster ME branch is located inside Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  $19 for a Cajun Lobster Roll. Here's my issue: Most of the lobster meat was dry, and tasted as if it was merely re-hydrated. Second, it's underwhelming because the \"cajun\" flavor was nothing more than an excessive amount of cayenne, paprika, and/or pepper. There's nothing that stands out. The bun was okay, and the house-made salt and vinegar chips were crispy.  The employees, who were probably a bit flustered from the longer than expected line, ended up giving my order to someone named \"Sarah,\" yet continued to call her name out for her actual order until I finally walked up and told them that I still didn't have mine after 30 minutes. Oh, yeah--I waited another 15 minutes for them to re-make my sandwich. In the end, the cashier apologized, and offered to throw in an extra lobster roll for free, but I kindly declined. It wasn't his fault, but my advice to them is to double-check the orders. My lobster roll sucked, but hopefully those of you reading this have a better experience than I did.",

Oh well, turns out I was not missing anything.   So, I ordered 2 different Lobster sandwich's.  Total with tax came to ~ $21  Pros: None.  Cons: Forgettable meal. I did not even taste much Lobster in the sandwich(-1) 2 Sandwich's were not enough. Not filling at all (-1) Expensive. Probably $2.00-$3.00 more than what I would pay for, even at Vegas. (-1) Employee yelled my name, and I proceeded to the counter for pick up. At that point, she was too busy counting her tips for the night instead of turning around and handing me the packaged order. Not good. (-1)",

The seasoning gave the lobster a good kick if you like your seafood a little on the salty side.  The lobster meat didn't fill the whole sandwich so there were bites of plain bread. Although I didn't try the Baja style lobster roll he claimed that the sauce masked the taste of the lobster.  The restaurant was out of the clam chowder so we ended getting the lobster bisque which was too salty.   It was a positive experience and we enjoyed the food. It felt a little on the pricy side even for lobster roll.",

We tried the lobster mac and cheese last time and it was a testament to how if you add lobster to anything it's passable.  The mac itself was pretty cafeteria style, it's been baked and left in a pan forever.  But then they top it was a heaping handful of lobster so you almost forgive them.  Almost.   However, the lobster roll is out of this world, perfectly buttered toasted parker roll piled high with a ridiculous amount of huge chunks o' lobster meat that just lightly tossed in lemon and some spices.  If you like a creamy lobster salad with smaller pieces this is not for you but for the lobster-vores out there, you gotta try it.",

The lobsicle was small considering the price, but then again it IS lobster. The lobster ice cream was surprisingly not bad, but I have absolutely nothing to compare it to.

It distracted us enough to get us lost on the way to Earls. =P About 20 minutes later, with our sandwiches in hand, we come to Lobster Me to find something we can share. The menu is of course pricey. This is Vegas and can they ship fresh lobster to the desert?  The menu consists of your classic rolls, soups, fried lobster and even breakfast items. I was tempted to try the lobster waffles. Unfortunately it isn't baked in, but covering the top. I like my sweet and savory combos though. My friends and I decide on the lobster mac and cheese ($9). It comes out, relatively fresh, creamy and definitely very rich. The cheese taste sharp and not too salty. The lobster is lathered on top. And I do find little chunks of lobster spread into the pasta on the bottom. Verdict: okay. I wouldn't have it just by itself because it is way too rich. And I probably wouldn't order it again because I think the ice cream caught my eye. =)  Lobster Me is good to try once, or twice if you really like something. But it's definitely a lot of $$$ if you want to order a lot. Why not just go to a buffet and pay a little more for an unlimited amount of lobster? =P",

    "text": "Lobster in a food court? Paint me red and call me skeptical.  That's what I first said when I noticed the Lobster ME counter in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. But I don't mind being proven wrong, as the missus (who is always right) will attest.  Lobster ME serves what they bill as the \"world's best\" lobster roll, and having eaten my way through New England with a single-minded focus on that region's delectable seafood, I would say they're pretty darn close.  Their Original Maine Style roll is served on a toasted brioche-style split-top bun packed full of delicious crustacean that is seasoned with just a hint of mayo and lemon, and their mix of spices. The missus had the Cajun version that was seasoned with a blend of Cajun spices and spicy butter. Both made the perfect lunch and were rife with savory but sweet lobster meat, with mammoth claws topping each sandwich.  We elected for the combo that cost just under $20 each and was served with tater tots (or fries) and a soft drink. The tater tots were not spectacular, and were akin to what you might buy in a bag in your grocer's freezer aisle, but they were crisped to crunchy perfection.  I would have tried the lobster ice cream that was also on the menu, but they were unfortunately out of it. I will, however, definitely stop by in the future when I am in need of a quick bite in this area: I would like to sample their lobster mac and cheese, and am somewhat tempted by the \"lobsicle\" (a fried lobster tail on a stick), but their breakfast menu and a promise of lobster and waffles really intrigues me.  Lobster ME is located down the corridor from the Halo Bar towards the mall's south entrance, or just head straight down the south entrance past Earl of Sandwich and the PBR Rock Bar & Grill.  They also offer free wi-fi: just ask them for the password, which they will print out for you on a register receipt.",

If you're not eating at another buffet or dropping serious money on a $$$$ foodie restaurant then you might be tempted to just eat a quick bite at some junk food place.  But why would you do that if you can get a lobster roll that is pretty damn good for a 10 minute wait.  We really enjoyed the Original and the Cajun.  The lobster Mac & cheese and fish tacos were also pretty decent.  The staff there pushed this from a 4-star to a 5-star.  Genuinely nice and friendly.  I would stop here anytime I'm back in Vegas and looking for a good quick bite.",

The lobster bisque hardly had one bit of lobster in it. the bread bowl was about the normal size but without any lobster in it, it was just plain soup, heavy on the butter taste. The Lobster Mac and Cheese was exceptional and had a plentiful amount of lobster in it and it was not overwhelmed with cheese. Perhaps it could have used a bit more cheese, but overall the taste was really good. Why three stars? Mainly it comes down to price. You can get the same things at other establishments for perhaps $2 or more less per item. It seemed you are paying for the name.   There are very little places to sit as they have these leather chairs that make it really difficult to eat there unless you hold your food. the shop next door has two tiny tables but they do the trick if they don't harrass you for not buying a drink. Simply adding some tables would help but I think they intend everyone to just leave. That is not so easy with a breadbowl of soup.   The location is not too difficult to find in the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood. Make sure you stop by the thunderstorm pond nearby. The staff was fine and seemed friendly.",

What really made me give it a 3 was the poor costumer service. When I went up to get the food I just asked if there was lemon and the guy handing it over had such a bad attitude about it. He then listed off everything he put inside the bag. It was a simple question that didn't need to rude remark.  Really though if you want decent priced food I guess this is an ok place to go to.",

The lobster and chips were pretty good and I recommend it if you want something fried and greasy.  My least favorite had to be the mac n cheese.  Maybe I'm biased since I'm not a big mac n cheese fan but they didn't load it up with lobster at all.  After about 2 bites I was basically just eating plain mac n cheese from the kraft box.

I kinda chuckled when I opened the container for the cevice, and there was the cevice in a small soup container with a few lonesome chips. I probably can safely say this was my least favorite cevice I've ever had... Didn't taste that great, the chunks were too big to pick up with their flaky chip, and it just looked un-appetizing.   Oh, and I tried a sample of their lobster ice cream.. Just tastes like vanilla icecream with random chunks in it. Probably wouldn't actually purchase it ever.",

    "text": "I spotted this place while buying my big ass drink at Fat Tuesday in the Miracle Mile shopping at Planet Hollywood.  Everything on the menu looked tasty, so I was excited when my friends and I came back the next day to grab food.  I ordered the lobster grilled cheese, expecting a regular grilled cheese with lobster in it.  Instead, I got slightly toasted bread with 1 slice of not melted cheese, and a lobster/cream cheese mix.  I was not impressed.  I did have a taste of the lobster mac and cheese, which was good.  I would get that if I ever end up at this place again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.   Bonus: they give free refills on soda  Tip: get your free sample of lobster ice cream",

The lobster was a bit chewy & it lacked enough mayo to bring the flavored together on the Maine style lobster roll. Plus when you get the fries & drink combo only expect like 15 fries. Not bad for lobster in a Nevada, but there is better for the same price in Vegas.",

    "text": "My girlfriend's and I were walking around Planet Hollywood waiting for our table at BurGR, and we were starving, so we decided to grab a snack at this place. I loved that they had a lot of different lobster dishes, and so we decided to try the lobster & chips.   As I was waiting in line, the girl at the counter didn't call me over to tell me it was my turn, instead, just gave me a look, like, are you ready yet? Um, yeah, I'm waiting in line. The register tape ran out of paper, so she went to get some more, acting very obviously annoyed with it and slamming it down. We decided to wait at the bar adjacent to the register, since all the smaller tables were taken.   The bartender brought out my beer, with the cap on, placed it in front of me and walked away. Excuse me, the cap is still on. She says, oh, it's a twist cap. So I ask her for a napkin so I can twist the cap, and she says never mind, and proceeds to twist the cap for me with an attitude. I'm sorry, don't bartenders typically twist the cap off your beer for you when they serve it?   The lobster and chips was good. I liked the light batter around the lobster, but would have definitely liked more than 7 pieces for $13. We also sampled the lobster ice cream, not sure what to make of it, but I didn't really get it.   I was so disappointed with the service that I don't think I'll be back.",

We also got crab loaded waffle fries topped with bacon and green onions which was sinful and amazingly delicious ! A Must visit if in the area !",

I was surprised at the tenderness of the lobster and the subtle sweetness it had. The clam chowder was just aiet. I used to live on the East coast so no clam chowder compares, but it was nice and warm, which really hit the spot.  Yeah, it's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get, but what do you expect?

I'm used to the rolls in the Boston and Maine area. I was very surprised to find such an amazing Lobster roll right here in Vegas. Starting with the bread it was warm, not too toasted and buttery. They give you a good amount of lobster on your roll and it is very fresh. I usually order the original or cajun lobster roll. The lobster mac and cheese is to die for!  The price doesn't bother me at all I'm used to paying sometimes up to $30 for a decent lobster roll back east. So around $17 for a roll here was worth it.

The food was decent albeit slightly expensive (but it is Vegas I suppose) and service was okay.   For food, I tried: - The Beltway lobster roll (lobster, shallots, chives, panko bread crumbs), 4/5: at first I was sad by how small it was compared to the picture on the menu board but it actually ended up being quite filling/rich. Decent amount of lobster but needed slightly more seasoning. Side chips and coleslaw were meh.  - Chowder fries (fries covered with clam chowder, cheese sauce, and bacon), 3/5: FYI this was not advertised as having bacon in it, so my vegetarian friend ordered it but then wasn't able to eat it because there were bacon bits mixed in everywhere. Tasted good but nothing extraordinary, although adding Cajun seasoning (you can ask for some) did enhance the flavor. - Lobster grilled cheese, 3/5: mostly a grilled cheese with tiny-small amount of lobster. As far as grilled cheese goes, it was quite delicious but then again, I wouldn't pay $10 for just a normal grilled cheese.   Overall, the lobster roll is probably the best thing to try here but it is rather small and $17. Not sure I would come back again.",

LOBSTER!!!!!!!!! It's supposed to be expensive- duh. Also, a few extra bucks for being on the strip in LV and you have a completely reasonable price.  The chowder fries are incredible. Good lobster rolls and mac and cheese. Grilled cheese was eh",

(But then again it's Vegas) For that price my expectations were somewhat high.  I encountered a pretty long waiting time for ordering and getting my food. The roll was really good! Not salty and doused in butter like I expected and the toasted bread was perfect. The size disappointed me, wasn't even the size of a 6 inch subway sandwich.  Worth my money?   Not quite. Not enough to fill you up, not mouth-watering enough to make you feel like your money was worth it. With Earl of Sandwich just around the corner I'd rather go there and get an entire meal for less than one sandwich at this spot.  Definitely not a bang for buck spot but if money is not an issue I would come back.  If I do come back I want to try the Mac N Cheese and lobster on a stick.",

They had many different lobster rolls to choose from but we got the original. There was def a good amount of lobster and not much fillers which I loved!   I wanted to feel healthy so opted for a side of lobster salad. It seemed a bit plain to me, but made me feel less guilty about wanting to try everything on the menu.   Also tried Lobster bisque and clam chowder-lobster bisque was not good, it seemed too runny for me. However the clam chowder was really good!  I really want to go back and try the Mac n cheese and grilled cheese sandwich. Aghhhh..but Lobster Me got the thumbs up from the hubby, so that's always a good sign, and that's coming from a really hard to please kinda guy!",

    "text": "Really good fast food, but at a high price.  While on vacation, my sisters boyfriend was tasked with showing me some of the local eats, at least something that you can find during late hours. I haven't been to the Miracle Mile Shops, but essentially, it's a mall that includes night life and eating places.  After traveling towards the center of the place, you can find Lobster Me, located right next to a Fat Tuesday, if you want one of those big margarita drinks that everyone walks around with. The place itself is only a usual mall-foodcourt type of storefront, so it's a free-for-all on seating, which isn't much in the direct area. It might be hard to find seating, especially if you're with a group, because there are a lot of people bumbling around, especially at night.  There were a lot of things that I wanted to try on the menu, but there lies a small endeavor, everything is crazy expensive. I know that it's seafood, lobster to be specific, but it was a bit expensive in my opinion. Expect to spend around $8-15 for most stuff on the menu.  I had the Lobster & Chips (you know, fish and chips, but lobster). I also upgraded my fries to calamari fries. I originally was just aiming for the regular clam chowder fries as my only dish, but I had some leeway on my budget, so I spent a little more. The lobster nuggets were pretty good, and the cam chowder fries helped round off the meal. I've had calamari fries at other places, but this one is just as good.  Definitely worth a try, check it out, but I wouldn't come here that often, simply because of the price.",

KRISTEN Marketing manager YOU Ask me to come back just to make me sick  of you're seafood. After tasting your food it made me sick. To My stomach, you made me assume the second time the food would've been at least eatable if I could have given this my opinion they should close it down this food is unhealthy on safe to eat. The quality of their seafood is probably a very low-grade lobster you shouldn't even say your seafood comes from Maine I no what is good fresh seafood taste like but this was just not acceptable at all.",

The best is still at the Lobster Roll (Lunch) out in Amagansett, NY. Here the toasted roll is just barely brushed with mayo, there's some Old Bay seasoning and the lobster. The lobster itself was good, not great.They serve it with cole slaw on the side which it added to the roll. It needed something more with some crunch and the cole slaw helped. They really need to punch up their lobster roll, it's pretty bland. Fries were very good and the chowder was also good. It's going to set you back some bucks, but it was just ok.",

The lobster mac and cheese was a very cheesy dish where you could barely distinguish the lobster on top because the cheese sauce was so sharp.    the lobster and chips had deep fried lobster pieces that were completely dry and chewy from being overcooked.  I did not try their lobster roll but based on the \"specialties\" I can't imagine it being anything special.  according to my car mates the lobster grilled cheese was pretty good and their fries were alright.  For lobster the prices were ok so I guess this is what happens when you try to take a high end food ingredient to the fast food arena where precision and expert preparation are hard to achieve.",

HOWEVER, my major issue was sanitation training.  Shortly after receiving my order,  which granted is the not so busy time of day at 3pm. The back kitchen preparer came out front and started tossing around some plastic thing, and dropping it several times on the floor, and his hands with food prep gloves subsequently touched the floor,  he also touched his face and back of head a few times, while going back and then preparing someone elses order.

My lobster roll didn't use mayo and celery like Mary's, I think it may have been lemon and celery salt, but it was fresh and there was plenty of meat. He had a lobster BLT and wolfed it down without offering me a bite.

But never fear we still had a great meal!  My husband had the clam chowder and the fish tacos and I had the Lobster and Fries.  I never imagined doing lobster tempura style, it was great, the meat was sweet and tender and the batter lite and krispy after the first bite I had forgotten about the lobster roll.  The fries were hot and crispy no grease and they served them with Malt vinegar, just the right touch.  My husband really liked the chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl (tasty bread), our adventure cost about $40. It was worth it!  We will be back!",

Yeah, it seems so weird that I had to try it. I got the lobster bisque in a bread bowl with a side of hash browns. The bisque was a nice creamy texture...but I didn't get too much lobster meat in it. Actually, I don't know that I found any lobster in it. The hash browns were crispy golden deliciousness though.",

    "text": "Honestly, all we wanted was to get a piece of lobster that wouldn't cost us an arm and a leg and that didn't require us to dress up .... that's how we like to roll sometimes.  Lobster ME seemed like a place that would fit our need and requirements perfectly, and I must say, after having experienced it. that it certainly did.  It's an odd concept, to have a Fast Food lobster place.  Fast food and lobster doesn't seem like it should be in the same sentence, but these guys made it work.  After peeking around at the menu and at other people's choice of foods, I decided to try the Lobsicle (lobster tail on a stick) and my husband went for the Lobster Mac and Cheese.  We also ordered a side of cajun garlic fries, just because they sounded exciting .... :)   The price was somewhere around $12 for each lobster dish and $4 for the fries.  Slightly above average when you consider the fact that it's fast food, BUT .... there's lobster involved, so even though it's cheaper than going to a lobster type restaurant, it will still be pricier than your average hot dog stand.  The food came out quickly.  My lobster tail on a stick was battered and deep fried and was served with a cup of butter,  The batter was very tasty, on the sweet side and it complimented the lobster very well.   The lobster mac and cheese was DA BOMB! I never knew lobster and mac and cheese belonged together in the same bowl, but obviously I'm terribly mistaken because it was a pairing made in heaven!  The sweet lobster, the macaroni and the creamy cheese sauce ..... It was just a very, very good idea!  The cajun garlic fries were tasty BUT ... do not eat if you're looking for a date or looking to score at some point that same day.  Just a word of fair warning.  The cajun spices provided a welcome kick, so we both enjoyed this side dish.    We'll definitely be back here for more lobster in the future.  It's a convenient and quick lobster fix that can fit in to anybody's budget, and so for what it is, I think it's a great idea and a great place to stop for food.  We didn't get to try the lobster ice cream, but it's on the agenda for next time ;-)",

New menu items! The freezer in front where they house their lobster ice cream is now in the back. That ice cream was the reason I fell out of love for this place.  Price-wise, it's inexpensive for the amount and quality of lobster you get on their lobster rolls...and you're saving money for not having to take a trip to New England! They'll charge you the same price for a lobster roll in New England anyway. $17 for a regular Maine-style lobster roll or $23 for large. But wait, if you're local, you get 20% off!   The bun on the lobster roll is buttery and toasted. Generous amounts of lobster with large claws on top. From their new menu, I tried garlic fries. It was very garlicky, yum!   And now the Benadryl is kicking in...can't write anymore. Zzz...",

    "text": "First time having Lobster Me was in April of 2016 while staying at PH. Indulged in the Lobster Bloody Mary two days in a row. Sure it's a little pricey but it was worth it. They were strong (they use Smirnoff, though) and tasty and the woman working there gave us both large claws each time.   Was just there with a bigger group that I dragged along. We wanted the Bloody Mary's (obviously) and figured we would give the food a try. In total we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, lobster roll, and chicken fingers and fries (I know but I wasn't in a Lobster mood). The mac and cheese was tasty but a small portion for the price and the lobster roll same thing. The chicken fingers were gross but the fries were good. I asked for ranch when I ordered but they didn't give it to me so I asked again for it and she told me it was a $1.50! Ok..... so she brings it to me and my change (they charge tax so it was $1.63) and it was a tiny cup of bland ranch. Really??? Seems stupid but that totally turned me off.   Also, I guess they are told to make the bloody Mary's weak now because we watched her pour less than a shot in it. If I wrote this in April I would have given 4/5 stars but the ranch and the weak expensive Bloody Mary annoyed me.",

This place, inside the mircle mile shops, has a small but strong menu with a really good lobster roll.   I tried the lobster blt, applewood smoke bacon stips, lobster, mayo, lettuce and tomato. Very good!  My husband got the original lobster roll with secret spice blend, both came on toasted split top bun.  We also got a bowl of clam chowder, served in sourdough bread bowl, yummy, a large amount of clams, small chunks potato, very good.   Limited table sitting, very busy area, free refills but gotta ask and very good food, just a little pricey!",

    "text": "Lobster \"M E\" = Manipulated Expectation. First off, I will say, I give this place 2 stars vs. 1 since the food was not of poor quality and the service was fine. The value however, was way off. Looking back I have only myself to blame, but I hope my post will dissuade other big hungry guys or perhaps their wife will read and warn them. DO NOT expect a sandwich from this. Despite the fact you are paying more than a filet minion, the sandwich is not a sandwich as many lobster roll joints have come to be known for providing over the past few years, but in fact an old school 5\" bread roll.   Here is where you \"Lobster-Lost Me\" folks:   If you were charging $5 to $7 for a 4 to 5 inch old school lobster roll (or even $10 to $12 in Vegas), that would be OK. However, when you charge $27 bucks, you better damn well slap that sucker in a hoagie bun and fill it up as I and every real American man expects it!   The giant \"sandwich\" photos at the booth at first glance look like normal sandwich rolls (AKA Hoagie Rolls for our East Coast Friends). Here is where I goofed. If you look closely at one photo, you can see wedges of avocado on the top. If I were smart and not hungry, I would have realized the roll was only slightly larger than these wedges. What these are is in fact, a bread roll and not a sandwich roll. At the price charged, the roll needs to be at LEAST 8 inches long and still contain sufficient lobster to spill out of the edges to the point of being nearly impossible to consume. Alternatively, Lobster ME may cut their prices down to $6 per roll.   I am doubtful either will happen. As such, hungry men everywhere, unite! Demand value and say \"NO!\" with me to this cruel and unusual punishment of our wallets and our appetites!",

That being said, it is lobster, which is not a cheap ingredient, and it is the Las Vegas strip, which has fewer and fewer bargains these days.  On my last trip to Lobster ME, I had the Cajun lobster roll with tater tots.  It's a decent size roll (the large) with the requisite buttery split top crust.  But, the lobster was overcooked, it wasn't tough, but it was getting close.  It certainly wasn't succulent, which properly prepared lobster is.  I liked the spice on the roll, and it's stuff full, so the amount is not an issue.  The tater tots are okay, better than say, Sonic, but just okay.  The entire meal is $27, which again, I don't think it's worth.  However, as noted above, I understand that lobster is not cheap and I don't expect to find value in a mall on the Las Vegas strip.  You can certainly do a lot worse if you are looking for a quick meal on the strip, but don't expect to be blown away at Lobster ME.",

The lobster is definitely legit. You get decent sized portions considering it is lobster. The lobsicle which I got grilled looked tiny for $14 USD. But again, it's lobster, and relatively speaking it was a relatively decent size of meat. I guess I was a little deceived after seeing a picture of it on their menu. Nevertheless it was quite delicious.  The roll was not bad and had decent chunks of lobster meat. But I felt it was eerily similar to the lobster roll I get at the local hockey area for half the price.     The soup I could have done without.   Unless you absolutely craving lobster at some exact moment you walk by this place in Vegas, I personally would probably eat elsewhere.",

I live in California and my mother lives in Las Vegas. I wanted to arrange to have a nice lobster dinner delivered to my mother for Mother's Day. Earlier in the week, I sent an email to Lobster Me to inquire about the options and obtain some recommendations. Kevin, the general manager was quick to respond and over the course of several days, he answered all of my numerous questions and made some excellent recommendations. I ordered the following:  Lobster Roll - Connecticut Style Lobsicle - Grilled Lobster Mac & Cheese Chowder Shrimp Cocktail Old Bay Fries  When I attempted to have the order delivered using the Postmates app, I encountered a problem. I was in panic mode and I immediately contacted Kevin. Not only did Kevin resolve the issue but he truly went above and beyond to personally make this delivery happen. The level of service that I received from Kevin was absolutely outstanding. He treated me like a Vegas VIP!!!  After my mother devoured her lobster meal she called me and she was so incredibly happy that she was almost speechless. She is a major foodie and she has impeccable taste and a very discerning palate. She told me the lobster roll was not only the most delicious lobster she has ever had, she further stated that it was one of the top two dishes she has had in her entire life!!! She said if there is food in heaven, the Lobster Me lobster roll would be there. My mom also loved the lobster mac and cheese and the seafood bacon chowder! She was too full to try the shrimp or the fries, however she indicated they looked very, very good.   Bottom line: The quality and flavor of the food was exceptional and the only thing better than the food was the outstanding level of service that Kevin provided. I have the highest praise you, Kevin. Thank you for making Mother's Day so special for my mom! You are awesome!!!",

My boyfriend were just walking around one night at the strip and came across this place and when we saw the pictures of their food I just couldn't resist in trying. I had the 3 tacos trio for $17 and mannnnnn. The first bite until the last was amazing. I had to order two more tacos. The trio comes with lobster, shrimp, and fish taco. And the sauce is banging. I will be dreaming of these tacos until the next time I come to Vegas.",

    "text": "Went back to Lobster Me today and had the Maine style and the Old Bay. This experience did not disappoint. Both rolls were just as I had remembered as the Lobster really popped and was prepared wonderfully this time. The Maine style had  celery, chives and a small  amount of mayo on a wonderful soft roll. Very generous portion of lobster. The Old Bay roll had shallots, chives , mayo, and seasoning with buttery Panko bread crumbs, again with a generous portion of lobster.   My favorite was the Old Bay, and the mixture of the panko, butter, and shallots really made this roll for me. Absolute purists should try the Original Maine Style if it it their first time, and then branch out to try the others. Washed it down with a refreshing blueberry lemonade, although there were several beer selections if you chose to partake.  A shout out to the staff and very helpful manager, Jessica at this location for guiding us thru the menu and providing friendly and helpful service.",

I had the lobster grilled cheese. It has a nice amount of lobster on some gooey cheese and definitely hits the spot. I would eat here every day if I could afford it.",

I always order a lobster bisque in a bread bowl with Cajun fries. I came back recently and the food wasn't as good as how it used to be. Prices are ridiculously over priced in my opinion for such a small amount. I ordered crab fries to munch on, and they came out cold... that threw me off because it's supposed to come out hot. No one likes their food warm/cold. And those fries were $10 too!! Ugh so frustrating. Oh yeah, seating is very very limited. There's not that much space and tables get taken up pretty quickly. I used to really love this place, I don't know what happened",

Even though we had gotten there shortly after 10, we received food that seemed like it had been sitting out (i.e. it wasn't piping hot). I chose the lobster roll, which had a good amount of lobster but tasted just ok. My sister had the lobster mac and cheese- and she's had better. She said that the lobster was sprinkled on top instead of baked together, so the flavors didn't meld together.   We also shared a clam chowder, which was a bit liquid-y and slightly sour. Not a huge fan.   Overall, just 3/5.",

I got the combo so I could have an iced tea, and my friends could share my fries. I knew $18 was a bit steep for me, but it's Vegas - and lobster!  The portions were bigger than I expected! Except.... for the lobster. But whatever. It was still delicious and fresh. Fries were good. Medium cut with semi-light cajun seasonings. Iced tea was unsweetened as promised - nothing special.  Employee working there looked very alternative, and was super friendly and helpful. I want to try one of their lobster rolls in the future. Hopefully there will be a little more lobster next time around.",

However, the Lobster Bisque was a let down.  The lobster bisque, although had a sufficient amount of meat, it was more on the saltier side.  As for the pricing, it is definitely a couple bucks for the same food.  The food though, was very filling.  I just wish they had more sauces, unless I missed it, then never mind.",

Unfortunately, lobsicle ($16) was pretty small for the price and lobster roll ($24) had a way higher bread to lobster ratio than desired. For a place that makes just lobster rolls, I really expected more esp for the cost. Luke's Lobsters, and even chains like Legal Seafood, do a better job. That said service was great. But I'd rather my money go to more lobster.",

It's a cold served product, and it still took 40 minutes to get our food. And the clam chowder was bland and flavorless.  PRO's:  Convenient location in the Miracle Mile Shopping center.

On a recent visit to Vegas, I stumbled about Lobster ME while shopping and decided to try their lobster roll sandwich (Connecticut style with butter) and the crab fries. The lobster roll was delicious, although a little bit light on the lobster for the $24 price. The roll was delicious and satisfying. They offer different ways to upgrade it and I really should have tried California style which also includes avocado and tomato. Definitely my plan for my next visit.   They lose a point for the crab topped french freids. Absolutely not worth the extra money. The cajun flavoring on the fries blew out any potential crab flavor as well as the flavor in the lobster cheese sauce. I couldn't taste anything except cajun spice.   I'll definitely be back, I just planning on skipping anything that isn't overtly lobster.",

This location is in the shops of the Planet Hollywood hotel right across from where we stayed at the Bellagio. My husband was still full from lunch and, frankly, so was I but I was craving the lobster mac and cheese. The cheese is quality because it's not watery and has great texture and flavor. The lobster is so yummy, warm, and buttery but I could've used more mac and lobster.   Two observations about this location: 1) My mom ate at the Venetian location on her trip and their mac and cheese seemed to have more lobster in the picture. And 2) they didn't have the lobster melt here which they had at the Venetian location and, as noted in my other review, was my instant favorite item from this stand. Definitely hit this place up, but maybe consider a different location.",

We waited around 15-20 minutes for our food, then went up to the rooms. When we got back, we realized they missed 2 lobsicle orders (worth half our order). So we had to go back down and ask for them. The comped is drinks, which was nice. What wasn't nice were the overlooked grilled lobster tails the size of my index finger, served with plain cabbage and what was undoubtedly imitation butter.  The rest of the food (signature lobster roll and loaded crab fries) were ok, if not a tad salty. There were also some crab shell fragments in the fries that was not pleasant to bite into.  The people working there were nice, but I still wouldn't return for the quality of food for the price (and in Vegas, you can definitely do a lot better).",

After eating earl's for the previous 5 meals, i decided to venture out and order something else. Lol...  I know, I'm a creature of habit.  Conveniently, this place is located right next to fat Tuesdays in the Miracle Mile.    Ended up getting the lobster roll and the lobster bisque.  I've had some legit lobster rolls in Boston, and lobster me doesn't even hold a candle to it.  This is a pretty sad excuse for a lobster roll.  It's just pieces of lobster on a butter roll for about $17 bucks.  And as for the soup, the consistency is a bit runny.  I doubt lobster bisque is supposed to taste like that.    There are a few seats located right in front of the shop, but if you come during rush hour, you might not be able to sit down.  The saving grace about this place is that the people working here are friendly.  You're better off taking your money and finding something else to eat.",

We ordered the lobster roll and expected it to be outstanding but ended up being pretty disappointed.  $19 is normal for a lobster roll, but these ones were so not worth the price.  It's a pretty small roll so sides are definitely a must if you want to be full.  Ours came with one or two chunks of lobster surrounded by a lot of minced chunks.  Not at all what I've seen in pictures!  There really isn't any taste to them either.  The lobster isn't sweet, it's not buttery, not much seasoning to accompany the overall blandness. But, that's what I should've expected from a fast food type shop.",

At best it was decent.   Nothing special about the lobster roll I had or the water down clam chowder. Fish taco was suppose to be fried but it didn't taste crunchy at all. I was very disappointed with our lunch.   It was said to be the best Lobster Roll in U.S   Not True, this is the worst Lobster Roll and clam chowder I have ever had. Even chowder in a can taste 10 times better then their water down chowder they serve.   The only reason why they got 2 stars was because the server was very friendly and they give you free refill drink.   Btw, if you yelp, hashtag, or Facebook they'll give you a free drink!",

Luckily, I also tried the lobster mac and cheese.  While it didn't have much lobster chunks in it, it was still a solid, solid mac n cheese.  I'd probably come back for this and maybe get one of those lobster tails on-a-stick next time.  Lastly, I tried the lobster ceviche.  Not much lobster, but a decent ceviche overall.  A bit sweet from the fruits in it, but the main complaint here is they only gave me 3 chips with it.  Kinda skimpy for a tiny $10 ceviche.  Meh overall.",

    "text": "I was SUPER excited to try out Lobster Me after my friend had Instagrammed pictures of his lobster rolls while in Vegas. It just so happened to be right next to the Fat Tuesday line so my girlfriend and I had to give it a try.   We ordered the Cajun roll after asking the register girl's opinion and it came out to ~$25... Most expensive sandwich I've ever purchased. But my girlfriend reasoned that it WAS lobster so I bit the bullet and waited it out.   MAJOR disappointment! First off, the large size is only 6 inches. 6 INCHES. I could buy 5 Subway foot-longs with the money I spent on this dinky roll! To be fair, it was absolutely stuffed with lobster meat and 3 claws on top but the meat was COLD. I was appalled. Probably my fault that I didn't ask the waitress if it was going to be a hot or cold sandwich but I didn't know that cold lobster sandwiches were a thing.   If I were to come here again, I would order a non-roll item like the tater tots or the mac and cheese because the roll was WAY underwhelming and WAY too much for my wallet.   Side note: A guy fainted face first on the tile floor and banged up his chin while waiting in line behind me. Not sure if it was from the sky-high prices or heat exhaustion and dehydration from his Fat Tuesday. Either way, be sure to mentally prepare yourself for these menu prices!",

Now onto the food -- I had the Original Maine Style and my husband had the Connecticut -- when they came out, the sandwiches looked so tiny BUT man, did they fill those buns up with tasty lobster!! Maybe our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because we both left full! I had the lobster bisque for my side and my husband had the lobster fries. The bisque was good but not the best and the lobster fries were kind of sad. I think we enjoyed our sandwiches the most but next time, we'll pass on the sides.

I got the beltway/beltline (cant remember the exact name) lobster roll and upgraded to the fries and drink combo. That came out to $22. In my opinion thats a bit much being that this location has more of the fast food feel. My bf got the lobster cheese fries and they didnt even look good. They looked soggy and just not something I would have wanted. The lobster cheese fries were $14. If I return here on my next visit to Vegas, I'd try something else...although there is nothing that isnt pricey. I think its just the fact that its more of a fast food type spot that thows me off with the prices.",

One of my favorite spots for a quick lobster roll in Vegas.  Tuckered inside Planet Hollywood's indoor shopping center. The lobster meat are a bit cold on the rolls.  Which dives it down a star.  I like my meat temperature warm or slightly hotter than room temperature so I would know they're pretty fresh from the steamer.  I'm pretty sure they keep it refrigerated after peeling it off the lobster.  I had lobster mac and cheese, 2 lobster rolls and 2 lobster popsicles.  The lobster roll wins hands down. The mac and cheese was good but with very little lobster meat.  The other downside is the quantity of meat.  It's around 5 ounces for a small.  But what I enjoy about it must be the soft buttery bread that encases it.  So good.  My plans in Vegas was to eat mostly Steak and Lobster.  And this does not disappoint on my seafood scale.  Make sure you wash it down with a hefeweizen which they also have on tap.",

    "text": "A native New Englander, I've wanted to try Lobster Me since it first opened, but rarely make Planet Hollywood a destination. Having won free tickets to the Beatleshow! (which is a really fun show btw) and with a half-hour to kill before we had to line up,  we found ourselves wandering the Miracle Mile and happened  upon Lobster Me. As we perused the menus, written on chalk blackboards (yes there is the obligatory nautical theme here, but you're ordering and picking up at a counter and eating at a random table set not quite in the pedestrian walkway so there's not much in the way of what I'd call \"ambience\" - hence the 4 not 5 stars) --- anyhow as we were standing there we were approached by a very friendly gentleman who explained the offerings and offered us samples - of which my husband gladly partook. Alas, they were out of lobster ice cream, but we promised to return to sample the cuisine after the show.  True to our word, we returned and ordered the lobster roll (save your money and do not order the extra large -- for 6 more dollars you're only getting about an inch more of roll and maybe one or two extra lobster pieces) and the lobster bisque in a bread bowl.  Aaaaaah the lobster bisque!!!  Served in a delicious sourdough bowl, it was piping hot - just the right temperature, with a lobster garnish and my oh my! it was so buttery and creamy and oh so chock full of lobster chunks!!! i really couldn't believe I was having this in Vegas!!!! And the lobster roll (for 3 more dollars you can get fries and a drink - it's worth it) -- was superb!! Yes I am a lobster roll purist - my benchmarks are Woods Seafood and Lobster Hut in Plymouth, MA -- and I never thought anything, especially out here, would come close. But OH!!! this succulent lobster was dressed perfectly and the roll was grilled just the way it would be back East!!  What a wonderful find!!  There's all kinds of trendy stuff here too -- lobster mac and cheese, lobster shooters, and the aforementioned lobster ice cream that we haven't tried yet,but suffice it to say that we might just make Planet Hollywood a destination, just to partake of the deliciousness that is Lobster Me!!!",

    "text": "BEST ever LOBSTER ROLL! I've had Lobster Rolls in San Diego, Santa Monica and now at this Lobster ME location in Las Vegas (Planet Hollywood) and THIS LOBSTER ROLL IS THE BEST! The meat is succulent, juicy, flavorful and fresh. If you're going to spend $18 on a sandwich, know that for a Lobster Roll, this one is worth it. It also comes with Kettle chips and cole slaw. Ok, the cole slaw is more like a tasting (size wise) that you'd get at Costco but it's not what I came here for so not a big deal. Back to the Lobster Roll...you MUST try it if you like seafood and Lobster in particular.   Seating wise...it is off of the strip and we came in on a Saturday evening (10pm-ish) so it was quite packed which is why we took ours to go. It's more counter service than a sit down place unless you can find an open seat that seems to cater to both Lobster Me and Fat Tuesday which is literally next door -it's a food court so you take your chances on seating, other than that, the food was worth standing in line and waiting. Give it a try!",

    "text": "DISCLAIMER: The photos are deceiving! The rolls are at least 1/3 smaller and the large generous pieces of lobster meat are non-existent. To add insult, the prices have increased.  It's really a shame. If you look at photos posted just a year ago, the rolls are stuffed with a heaping of lobster meat, even full pieces of claw meat, and looks absolutely tantalizing. The roll we got was small (think a thick slice of bread - like Texas Toast folded in half) and it was barely filled with chopped up lobster meat. So, what happened? I want to know where were my lobster claws and why was I robbed of lobster??  Original Maine Style Lobster Roll ($17): Chilled lobster meat mixed with mayo and spices and served on a toasted, buttered brioche. Accompanied by a side of lightly dressed cole slaw. The bread was soft and flavorful and the lobster meat seemed good. It was nice with the freshly-squeezed lemon. Again, I would have really enjoyed it if there was enough lobster meat. There was too much bread to the amount of lobster and we actually had a couple bites with NO lobster! This was really disappointing for the price.  We opted for the Fries + Drink combo (+$3) and went for Cajun Fries (+$1). The beer-battered fries were crispy and delicious. The Cajun version was well-seasoned and I loved the addition of chopped scallions. FYI: If you choose a fountain drink, it has unlimited refills.  Lobster Mac & Cheese ($12): This was just okay. The pasta was dry with not nearly enough sauce and the lobster meat was, again, skimpy. There was nothing special about this dish as it wasn't flavorful and there wasn't enough lobster to taste it within the dish.  The Lobsicle ($14): Lobster tail on a stick and it's available grilled or fried. I went with fried which has a light coating of their beer batter and it's served with melted butter and lemon wedge. This was absolutely delightful. The lobster was cooked nicely and the batter was crispy. I loved the fresh lemon juice and butter for dipping.   I really did enjoy the food, however, I don't like feeling cheated, so I can't say I'll return or recommend the \"World's Best Lobster Roll\" (meh).  Note: They offer a locals discount of 20%! Just show the cashier your Nevada ID.",

This place has progressively gotten worse each time, unfortunately.   First, they kept changing the sizes of their lobster rolls, then they changed the bread, the seasoning and now the whole thing is just not good.   There is less lobster and the bread is stale and small. They used to serve awesome lobster claws on top, this is no more. Everything about this roll is screaming \"What did you do to me!!?!?!?\". And I know why it's screaming that.   Also, their lobster mac and cheese is always super cold. They should mention this to the clients if this is their intention. Even the clam chowder tastes more like it's been preserved and not fresh, also served in a stale bread bowl. I feel bad for talking this place up and sending people here.  The service is good, and the cleanliness is fine.   I've been in denial for too long. My love affair in the last year with this place has dissipated.  This is  no longer my favorite place to go on the strip. :(  It's way overpriced for what they're offering now. When they started, it was worth the price.   Please, consider going back to your old ways. And please inform me when you do. Until then, it was a pleasure knowing you.",

FOOD:  Connecticut Style Lobster Roll $17 (warm lobster meat tossed in butter)  The lobster rolls here are AMAZING. Lobster tastes fresh and chunky.

Even though it is served with a complimentary small salad on the side, do expect to still be hungry!  Original Maine Style Lobster Roll $17 (chilled lobster with mayo and spices)  This lobster roll equally had fresh chunky lobster. The flavorings tasted simply like lemon and pepper. Still good, but I prefer mines warm.  Clam Chowder +$4 The clam chowder was good. The soup was not gelatinous but was smooth. It had good chunks of potatoes and other good stuff.  Blueberry Lemonade $4 This drink was really good. Not too sour. Not too sweet. Just perfect.  Apple Cider $4 This drink is really unique. It doesn't have a strong apple flavor, but more of a orange spiced apple.   Overall, good places to go for quality lobster. But VERY expensive for such small portion sizes. Great place if you don't have a huge appetite!",

For a Lobster Roll and combo, which includes fries and drink, was $25.00.   I ordered the lobster roll with panko or bread crumbs on it. I was expecting chunks of lobster and a couple of claws as stated by other Yelp reviewers.   My lobster roll consisted of shredded lobster than didn't even fill the ends. It could of used a little more mayo on it, it just seemed lacking a little. The meat was tasty, but for the price, it wasn't quite there.   I've had some pretty good lobster rolls at other restaurants, this one came up short. My friend had the same sediments as me. He also got the chowder and said it was really runny.   If the price was less, then what we got for our buck would had been great, but for the price, it needs to stand out more.   I probably won't be going back, since the price and quantity and quality wasn't worth it to me.   But I might try the lobster macaroni one of these days there.",

The picture looks way too big than the actual ones. C'mon seriously? $19 for this little meat? Especially it is not even the tail meat. It's from the claws which is cheaper. I'm just so disappointed. Definitely not satisfy with the quality and quantity, but service was great. Nice people.",

    "text": "I know folks have been assuming this place is trying to be clever by naming themselves Lobster ME since ME is supposedly abbreviated for Maine, home of the world's best lobsters.  Their choice of price point and marketing strategy to serve their food in the style of your neighborhood galleria is questionable (when was the last time you purchased a single item in a food court over 15 bucks, including airports?)   My latest theory is that the name was originally supposed to be Lobster MEH and even their shoddy construction of the sign resulted in the H falling off.     In terms of quality, this place strikes me as the byproduct of a marginal Iron Chef contestant presented with the secret ingredient of succulent Maine Lobster and concocting 4-5 mediocre dishes (including the fatal death blow of using a savory ingredient for ice cream)  The judges have spoken: Iron Chef Meh, your cuisine does not reign supreme.  Save your money to purchase two amazing lobster rolls caught right off of Cape Cod for the price of one \"world's best lobster roll\" (picture me taking two lobster claws and making air quotes) that you could be purchasing here.",

    "text": "We got the lobster roll, lobster grilled cheese, lobster bisque, and fish and chips. The roll was standard, it lacked a little flavor and was a tad dry for my liking. The grilled cheese was disappointing. The cheese was still solid (one of my biggest pet peeves when you order a \"grilled\" so-and-so or a \"melt\"). As for the flavor, the sauce they lather on gave it a little too much richness. Now that I think of it, I should have ate the roll together with the grilled cheese to counter balance each other. The bisque was nice and creamy, but lacked the lobster element. The fish and chips, surprisingly, was our favorite dish. It was meaty and crispy, and was the only thing that we finished. An extra star was given because of the service. It was a nice surprise to see workers come out to the table to make sure everything was to our liking.",

I didn't manage it until the last meal of my trip, which wasn't a bad way to end a nice getaway.   As generic as it sounds, I really love me some bisque. (Omg deja vu!) I ordered the bisque in a bread bowl. I wish that they had toasted the top of the bread with some butter, but that's my wishful thinking. Cold bread, thick generic tasting bisque, no lobster in sight. Sadface. I would suggest you skip this. I wouldn't have known what I was eating if I had not ordered it off the menu myself.   The lobster roll was pretty satisfying. I liked the spice blend, and with a bit of added salt, the sandwich was quite tasty. I also wished that there was a ton of melted butter to pour over the top for maximum consumption value, but alas, you don't always get what you want.",

I was hungry and it was late but this outlet was around the corner in the Miracle Mile shopping center which is connected to the hotel where I am staying.  I had the Connecticut-Style Lobster Roll (lobster cooked in butter instead of mixed with mayonnaise, Maine-style, which they also offered) combo with Cole Slaw, a cup of the New England Clam Chowder and an Apple Cider with the bill coming to a couple of pennies under $25.  Quality was pretty good even if quantity was a little on the small side for the price, almost snort-able up a nostril now that I think of it in hindsight...but what the heck, this is Las Vegas where everything's more expensive for tourists than even New York City but if they give me the good stuff, at least it takes some of the sting out!",

    "text": "As someone who goes to Vegas way too many times a year, walking around the same casinos can get a little monotonous (need to take a break from gambling, somehow and somewhere) That's why if there's anything new and food-related that pops up, I'm immediately curious and will want to try -- even if my stomach is full. Hey, I'll make room.  So, walking around Planet Hollywood shops, we stumbled upon Lobster ME (as in abbreviation for Maine), adjacent to a Fat Tuesday. If I recall correctly, this space was previously a Godiva. Front and center, they immediately claimed to have the world's best lobster roll. Oh really. I needed to find out for myself.  They have some other unique items, like lobster and eggs, lobster and waffles, lobster grilled cheese, lobster mac 'n cheese, and the lobsicle (gasp, another lobster-on-a-stick version, similar from the truck I just tried back home in OC). Plus, they have... wait for it... lobster ice cream. But I'll talk about that a bit later.  So with a belly stuffed with Earl of Sandwiches, I managed to make enough room to try their lobster roll for $16 (plus I split with several people). That's for the regular size. If you want a bigger size, it's $22. The lobster roll is pretty decent. I've had my fair share from the East coast, fancy versions from LA restaurants, and plus from an LA-based food truck. So all kinds of lobster rolls.  This lobster roll had a nice and toasty, buttered roll, with a slight crisp. Inside, it was stuffed with plenty of lobster meat from the tail. On the outside, they put the claw meat. This lobster roll isn't mayo-based, but with butter -- just enough so that it's not overpowering the meat. Flavor-wise, I thought it was fine. No need to over-salt, fancy seasonings or sauces.  We tried a small sample of the lobster ice cream. It was pretty disgusting. It was like tasting a mouthful of butter ice cream with little pieces of frozen lobster chunks inside. Intriguing, but just not a good combo -- but it gets people talking about it though.  So 3 stars strictly just for the lobster roll. Everything else on the menu? Eh, not so sure if it's worth trying. But hey, I'm a purist when it comes to lobster. Simplicity is everything. Lobster should be consumed steamed with a subtle touch of butter. You want to taste the meat. All these other dishes incorporated with lobster seem to be just a gimmick.",

    "text": "I was trying to be \"good\" on my trip to Vegas this time...trying to eat well and not go overboard...exercise daily...all that went out the window when at 10pm I turned the corner in the Miracle Mile and like a shining beacon from Heaven saw the words \"LOBSTER ME\" (I do believe I heard angels singing...)  I wanted it all...I wanted to try EVERYTHING...my head was spinning with Lobster combinations that I had never had before...but I settled for a single Lobsicle.  After all, I was trying to be \"good\" wasn't I?  I figured a Lobsicle's portability could assist in my noble attempt to stay on my \"diet\" since I could easily eat it while walking the mall for 3 miles...I'd just call it a \"push.\"  Riiiiiiiiight...  I walked around gnawing that thing and must have been stopped by 10 people asking me \"what IS that?\" - I pointed behind me in the direction of the pearly gates and said \"Lobster Me!\" - run, run while it's still open!!!  Needless to say...I gave in to temptation, which is not hard to do in Vegas.  I went back in the morning for the Lobster & Waffles...and the Lobster Wontons, and the Grilled Cheese, and the bisque, and the ice cream...and another Lobsicle.  Ok, ok, I admit it...I have a problem.  A serious lobster problem.  The only thing that could have made any of this any better would have been bacon...  Seriously, the people who DIDN'T give this 5 stars are all on crack...yes, it's expensive people...it's REAL LOBSTER!!!!  It's not langoustines, not crawfish, not any other stupid thing cheap restaurants try to pass off as real lobster...this is the REAL THING!!!  It is from New England and sweet and succulent and AWESOME!!!!  This food could easily be served in a fancy restaurant for more money!!  Lobster rolls - no filler, just a soft, sweet brioche-type bun with delicious seasoned lobster and more lobster...we could all argue until the cows come home over what makes a good roll, a bunch of mayo & celery or just seasoned lobster on a roll, but this roll is for purists...not people looking for a hot dog bun with lobster salad plopped in it.  Lobster Wontons - the filling is some kind of curried lobster mix and delicious, served with a side of sweet chili sauce.  Lobster Grilled Cheese - almost like a creamy cheese & lobster panini but softly toasted bread and creamy yummy cheese inside.  To die for!!!  Lobster Mac & Cheese - yes, it's on the \"drier\" side of the Mac & Cheese gamut, but that's what makes it so perfect.  Just lobster, cheese, breadcrumbs and YUM!  This is NOT your Kraft Mac & Cheese, it is not your mom's ooey-gooey runny cheese type Mac & Cheese.  It is like the kind you get in an upscale restaurant that only needs a few ingredients to make it good.  I have tried every Lobster Mac & Cheese I have ever seen, and this one is definitely one of the best!  Lobster on a stick (called a \"Lobsicle\") - ok, who is the friggin' GENIUS who invented THIS???  Let's put a Lobster Tail on a stick, deep fat fry it, and serve it with a slice of lemon and a bucket of butter...this is so much better than the crap-on-a-stick you get at the fair!!!  I picture this to be the fair food of the Rich & Famous...like there is a little Lobster stand at the Beach near the Hamptons where Muffy & Biff can stop and pick up a few Lobsicles to eat as they stroll the beach in their white tennis outfits?  Lobster Bisque - not the best I've ever had (that was the Clubhouse at South Coast Plaza - RIP) but it is a really REALLY good knock-off!!!  I am a HUGE Lobster Bisque snob...I like my bisque more on the creamy sherry side & not the tomato fishy side.  This was a perfect creamy sherry laced tasting bisque with a huge dollop of chopped lobster bits thrown in - all served hot & fresh in a yummy sourdough bowl.  I could have eaten 3 more of these...  Lobster Ice Cream - I know, it sounds gross...but it is AWESOME!!!!  Vanilla-based ice cream with chunks of lobster throughout.  Not sure if they soak the lobster in sugar or if it really is just that sweet to begin with, but this is one special taste you need to try!!!  They will let you have a small taste if you ask for it- try it!!!  Lobster Waffles - Now, let me preface this by saying that I am a HUGE fan of bacon & syrup together...I went ape-sh*t when Denny's had \"Baconalia\" and made the maple syrup bacon sundae.  If you like sweet & salty things, you will LOVE these Lobster Waffles.  Like in the Lobster ice cream, the lobster they use is the sweet New England kind, so it blends perfectly with the Belgian-style waffle & maple syrup.  The chunks of Lobster are tempura-battered and tossed on top of the waffle.  I cut mine up so I could savor a bite of everything each time...and used the extra side of syrup provided (of course!)  I will be back...again and again and again...LOBSTER ME BAY BAY!!!!",

The lobster roll mostly consisted of split top bun, which I guess is good if you're really into eating buns. The pictures of a lobster roll overflowing from top to bottom with lobster and giant claw meat on top isn't remotely close to what I received. There was a minimal amount of lobster in my sandwich, and 2 or 3 small pieces of claw meat that in no way covered the top. The flavor wasn't anything remarkable. I was so bummed when I received/tried my food.   The (lobster) mac and cheese was bland. I ate most of the lobster off the top and threw the rest of the dish in the trash. The dish is just mac and cheese with browned breadcrumbs and then lobster sprinkled on top after the mac and cheese has been cooked/heated up.  Kraft mac and cheese has more character and flavor.  I'm still surprised that they don't incorporate the lobster into the mac and cheese. I was expecting a creamy, savory concoction that featured or highlighted the lobster, and that is not what they have going on.   Save your money.",

It was filled with plenty of lobster but was not tossed in the mayo/scallion mix a Maine lobster roll would have. It seemed to have a vinegar based medley that overwhelmed any on the natural flavors.

Came back after purchasing three sandwiches at Earls, and pondered over what we wanted to get. We decided to settle for the lobster mac n cheese, which came out to almost double digits! Holy ish, as a broke ass college student, I definitely was NOT liking the way this little side was coming out to be so far.... that's EXPENSIVE. You better give me a pound of this lobster mac n cheese, or have a shat-ton of lobster in this mac n cheese if you're charging $9 for this. And then I start dreaming.... and I think of the time I had some BOMBDIGGYDANGDIGGYDANGDEDANGDIGGY lobster mac n cheese at Capitol Grille at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, CA... and how their $15 lobster mac and cheese side was SO WORTH EVERY DAMN PENNY after eating it... and that was litterally what I was expecting, but hopefully, better.  What came to us, however, was a little lacking. We found very few lobster pieces, the serving was puny at best (as with everything else on Vegas' strip, super expensive!), and it was dunked in oil, oil, and uh, more oil. I kid you not. Now, don't get me wrong, the flavoring of the mac n cheese, I felt that it was pretty good... in fact, I probably would have given them 3 stars in my review since I loved the sharpness of the cheddar and how it cut into the well cooked, super soft macaroni... however... the price of what we paid vs what we got + the next day, when I heated this up, the amount of GREASE that came out (OMG, artery clogging!) + the pathetic amount of lobsters in this serving of lobster mac n cheese? Not the best impression.  For me, personally, Lobster Me became a place that I would try just to say I've eaten there before, but if I were to do some real grubbing? Ehhhh, not so much.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed with the lobster roll. It was a complete waste of $25! Dry tasteless bread with maybe 2 ounces of dry lobster meat. I will never recommend nor eat here again. I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately I got it \"to-go\" and was too far away to go back and complain. I was surprised because there is so much competition in Las Vegas so I assumed the lobster roll would be amazing. It was amazing all right - amazingly disappointing. We go to Las Vegas all the time, so we will seek a different place to eat on our next visit.",

    "text": "Not bad!  Got the Original xl and shared with bf for a snack.  The chunks of lobster were better than I thought.  However, putting it into perspective, it was $24 (if I remember correctly) which is more than the price of a dinner buffet at the M resort.  However, it was a nice snack.  It had a very buttered toasted bun, butter and mayo, with a hint of lemon in it.  Like I mentioned, big chunks of lobster.  I thought the meat would be warm but it was cold.    If it were cheaper or bigger I'd give it 5 stars.  This is like a lobster roll I would make at home.",

    "text": "Lobster ME \"NOT\" I read some review and said \"what the hay lets give it a try\" The bread was soft buttery and nicely toasted. About the size of a large hot dog bun. It is stuffed with claw meat and knuckle meat as my server told me. There is no tail meat in there or anywhere to be found. Not in the soup, not in the Mac & Cheese, not in the ice cream nowhere. Where is it????? If you go let me know if you find any...   The servers were young and cute, they will try to sucker you into ordering a lot of food. Because, nothing comes with....  At $16.00 a pop (Small) $22.00 large this is not reasonable for a place that looks like a fast food joint. You can easily spend $55.00 for two. By then you'll need a shot....   Yeah the bread part was tasty, and yes there is some lobster. But, lets get down to brass taxes here. The lobster should be front and center. Sad to say, It was tasteless. No seasoning in the steaming pot, I'm sure. So sorry people, but where are your taste buds? You have none or you haven't been to Joe's Stone Crabs better yet, Maine for that matter. There was a bit of salt and pepper on top to tickle your maiden taste buds but for the mature, go elsewhere.....",
