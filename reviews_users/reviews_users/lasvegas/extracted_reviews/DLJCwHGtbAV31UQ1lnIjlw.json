Ordered burrata and after almost 25 minutes waiting I was brought something that looked like a fish. Obviously the bartender entered wrong item. It happens. But not one apology. Eventually got my burrata and it was nothing special. Heirloom tomato was very soft. All in all, too many choices in Vegas to settle for the food and service I received this night.",

    "text": "The room feels slightly empty, but it's still a decent place to go for dinner. Not really a \"date night\" feel.   The food is 3.5 star. Most of their dishes come with home made pasta. Their meats and cheeses are said to be aged and cured in house- which were delicious. Their desserts need some work. We ordered the tiramisu, which lacked the rum, so it was dry, a banana split that was made with gelato and the canolis. The cream in the canolis had too much citrus, it was overwhelming.   The bar has several different types of wine, but they don't know how to make an old fashion. When I described it, they literally threw an orange slice and a cherry into a big glass of bourbon.   The reason for the 4 star was because of Pasquale.  He makes this restaurant. His service is so personalized and so genuine. Although it wasn't busy, he made us feel like the only table in the restaurant. We will come back because of him.",

    "text": "Las Vegas has roughly 5000 delis- this is one of the best.  Half of the building is an upscale restaurant and half is a grocery/deli you can dine in- immediately turn to your right upon entering to to to this section. The other half is basically for upscale dinner-quality dates.  The bakery-deli-grocery has everything you could possibly need from fresh pastas to calamari salad to real canned peeled San Marzano tomatoes for kitchen adventures and more marinated artichokes, olives, and peppers than you can shake a stick at.  Order at the back counter for takeout or dine-in: the first sandwich listed on the \"hot\" page is what you want to get. It's a chicken cutlet with spinach, fresh cheese, and God only knows what else, and it's frickin' amazing. Runner up is the Sicilian sandwich, the first listed on the \"cold\" page, with ham, Genoa, and mortadella with mozzarella- get it with everything on it. Fresh crunchy veggies, complementary spices and oil, and the freshest and most flavorful meats and cheeses I've yet encountered.  Both sandwiches are made with the freshest, most delightful french roll bread. Oh, and they're frickin' huge. Like half of a single sandwich is an entire meal, huge.  If that's not enough for you, there are two cases of desserts and the service is phenomenal- be sure to get the guy with the thick black-framed glasses, he's delightful! And they have both regular happy hours (3-7PM, daily) and reverse (Mon, Tues, Thurs, 9PM to close) with half price drinks and apps.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times before during lunch time. I always got the pasta with a creamy garlic sauce and lobster, scallop, and shrimp. I usually get it substituted with angel hair pasta. I also really love the caprese salad. It was my absolute favorite Italian place with the amazing service and food. I raved about it to my husband because I usually came with a friend. We decided to come in last night for my husband's birthday dinner. He had high hopes for this place because of my description. I came in and I was so disappointed because it was supposed to be special for my husband's birthday. We were greeted by a friendly young man who graciously led us to a booth and made joke with us. He was incredibly helpful with explaining the special menu. He was the best person on staff tonight. I wish I got his name. The server, William greeted us by asking us if we wanted to start off with waters. No smile. I told him iced water would be fine for me. My husband asked if there was sparkling water so the server said 'okay' and rushed off. He came back with a large bottle of Pelligrino and began to pour in the glass in front of me. I apologized and said the sparkling water was just for my husband. He looked at me as if I was being an inconvenience to him and told the busser 'can you get water for the lady?' And the both of them rushed off. It is fine that there was a misunderstanding but I didn't appreciate how he acted like I was a big inconvenience. When he came to take our order, we ordered the bruchetta and marinara mussels for our appetizer. My husband ordered the rib eye and I had my usual pasta. We had finished up our appetizers and 3 people walked by our table multiple times each, not bothering to pick up our plates after we stacked them. We were the only ones on the restaurant side. This usually wouldn't bother me but William's unkind attitude had me in a bit of a sour mood.  Will brought out our entrees and left. He was not being friendly at all. He put me under the impression that I was being a bother to him when I did not try to cause an issue. He asked us if we wanted dessert and unfortuantely we were too full. I had thanked him and said we were full but the check would be great but he walked away in the middle of talking. It really made me annoyed because I have always spoke positively about this place but last night's experience was not good.",

You might want to work on not only your customer service skills, but your maturity. I chose Siena because i had eaten there before and enjoyed it. Telling me \"next time go get Chinese food\" is insulting and extremely unprofessional and im curious as to how your bosses will react when notified...",

    "text": "After living in Las Vegas for a little over four years, and hearing remarkable things about Siena, I took some out-of-town guests there for dinner last night and had a less than desirable experience. I'm not a typical restaurant complainer, but with a restaurant as well known and regarded as this one, I simply expected better.  Let me start out by saying the food (for the most part) was delicious. I will say that they offer a \"create your own\" cheese plate. The portions of cheese were embarrassingly small. We actually laughed when it came to the table, because I've heard that Siena is known for their cheeses.  Now for the not so good:  First of all, we visited on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was not crowded. Our waiter had to have been new. He mumbled and we could barely understand anything he said. He seemed as though he would have rather been anywhere but there. He took our drink order and about 10 minutes later, returned to let us know the bar was out of one of the flavored vodkas required for the specialty martini featured on their drink menu. We clarified our drink order, and then it took another FIFTEEN minutes to receive our cocktails. We watched them sitting on the bar for most of that fifteen minutes. We had to ask for additional bread several times before receiving it. The service was definitely lacking, and I want to think that this was just a bad night, however, this was our first impression, and will likely be our last here. I was surprised that in a restaurant of this caliber that there was no visible management presence. We never had anyone stop to ask how the evening was going, nor was there anyone visible for us to bring our concerns to.  I hope that the team at Siena can learn from this review in an effort to delight their guests in the future.",

I called my husband to see what he wanted. I was going to get the meatball Parmesan but, when j asked if it was good the girl said \" if you like meat and cheese yes\". Obviously, if I was inquiring about it duh. Anyway, I changed my order to the Sicilian (which my husband ordered while I was on the phone getting his order in front of the girl worker). I asked for no ham. We discussed it for a minute or so. I took a look around prices seem high. I ordered a coffee it was very good. They use  Lavazza Italian coffee. ( so. ?).   The kid rings up my order. I sit and wait for my food about ten more minutes and I'm thinking \" God, this is taking long\". I ask \"is my foot ready\"? Oh it was ready when you paid for it . I'm starving n I'm sitting here waiting. Really? Then, I look in the bag and I have one sandwich not two. Wtf? To be honest I would have rather gone to subway. I'll use the gift card to buy coffee there and make it at home.",

They are planning to move soon which makes me sad.   I think the owners are ethnic Italians. They have the Italian channel and sometimes you can even find an old Italian musician playing an accordion and singing from time to time. Truly the coolest Italian place I have found.",

It's a tad too loud, and not especially good. Luckily, you can sit outside! Great bread. Great cocktails. Great salads. A very enjoyable culinary experience, but the live music has got to go. It's the only reason we wouldn't go again (in the winter it'll be too cold to sit inside!). Love this joint!",

Today is the Take-Out.  So, on the suggestion of the Awesome Princess Crystal Dawn.....the conversation went kinda like this : Damon : I'm hungry. Crystal : Well, I have a cure for that? Damon : Oh really? Crystal : Yes, really, Siena. Damon :  Who's that? Crystal :  It's an AWESOME Italian Deli.  ....and history was made.  I clocked out for my lunch break eager to feed on something from anywhere new.   Walking into Siena is like walking into charm.  You are automatically surrounded by deli that could easily be a movie set.  I took a number.  Ordered the days special Fettuccine and Red Sauce with Chicken and Eggplant.   Oh, and  3 canolli.  The wait was a little long, but who cares, there was just so much to take in.  The hanging sausage, the cheeses, the baked goods tempting me at the front case.   Anything and everything you could possibly want and thought you could only find in NYC.  I walk out the door lunch in hand.   As I'm driving back to work I realize I can't wait to partake of one of the canolli.   Now my roommate constantly touts the beauty of the canollli, but let me tell you, I've had a few,Vegas canolli aren't a beauty....at least until now.  All 3 found their way into my mouth before I parked my car.  Ummmm...WOW.  Why eat anything else EVER!!!  Why move on to the (what felt like 5lbs. of pasta) Fettuccine I had actually intended to be my lunch.   But I did it, and it was worth it. ( I can't believe I ate the WHOLE thing. )  Now my friends, I need a nap. Next time I'll stay and take more time.  Try that beautiful Sicilian pizza they had.  Until then  canolli wishes and spumoni dreams.  Siena Deli - FOR THE FAMILY, BY THE FAMILY",

(the reason it annoyed me was because I was also informed that there was no \"special\" menu, which it WAS!) My family is a big fan of eggplant parm and they would not accommodate either. Overall, the food was 6/10, the service staff were fairly personable. I was building this place up for my friends & family and instead all I heard was an earful about their experience.

The bruscetta would benefit from less quantity, more quality.  I've had it a couple times and the tomatoes lack flavor.  The bread is also pre-toasted and then left to sit.  For entrees i've had veal with mushrooms.  It was pretty good but nothing too memorable.  The pastas are good (you can buy many of the ingredients at their store next to the restaurant).  Espresso is good.  Worth a visit if you're stuck on that side of town.",

A bad experience could turn into a positive one with one and only small gesture: Let me know it will take a while or take 1 minute to take my order, so that I know you're not just wasting my time. What makes other's order so much more important than mine that you cannot even talk to me???  This is not the first time that this happened... it just gets worse each time... enough to scratch it off my list of good places. I'll just go down the street a few blocks to Roma Deli instead.",

    "text": "This review is for the Trattoria half of this business. I am a long time customer of the Siena Deli that was at Tropicana and Eastern. I used to eat lunch there whenever I was within 5 miles when I used to have my mobile computer repair business in Las Vegas. After I moved to Colorado I always ended my road trips to Vegas with a stop to get lunch and to purchase some sausage or other Italian meats to put in a cooler to take home with me. So when I heard that Siena closed my old favorite Deli and opened a Trattoria/Deli I couldn't wait to give it a try. Needless to say by my 3 stars that my first trip to the new place wasn't a good one, if it wasn't for the food I would have given them 1 or 2 stars and maybe my Italian anger is still too strong to write a fair review but here's what happened.   My wife had received an anniversary coupon from their email club so when we were back home on a business trip celebrating our anniversary we drove all the way up the west end of Sahara. My wife ordered the Ravioli Burro E Salvia (Cheese Raviolis on Marinara with a butter sage reduction) and I ordered the Sausage pinwheel with a side of Broccoli Rape, I always knew this as Robbies, Broccoli Rabe or Rapini. My wife loved her Raviolis and I really enjoyed the Sausage. But when I asked the waiter if they had Broccoli Rabe thinking that it might be out of season and he said yes, I was excited as it's hard to find in Denver and I love Robbies. When my meal was delivered on my plate was Broccoletti or Broccotini, I told my waiter that this was not what I ordered but he insisted that what was on my plate was \"Rapini\". Then to try and convince me he called over another waiter and he also argued with me saying that the Broccoletti was Broccoli Rabe or Rapini. Now, I've been eating Broccoli Rabe my entire life and know the difference between the two and getting into an argument with 2 NON-Italian waiters over what I ordered made me very angry on a night I was trying to celebrate my anniversary. I told him to tell the chef that what he served me was not Broccoli Rabe. When I finished my Sausage the waiter returned saying that the chef apologizes and offered us a dessert compliments of the house. This started to make me feel better. He took away my plate with the Broccoletti that I didn't eat and brought us our dessert.....Spumoni. On their dessert menu they described the Spumoni as chocolate, pistachio and strawberry gelato with whipped cream. What he brought was only chocolate and pistachio gelato, no whipped cream but it was very good anyway. I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth and was thankful for the free dessert. Then I got the bill. They charged me $2.00 for the Broccoletti that I did not order or eat! I waited for the manager to come to the table but I guess an unhappy customer wasn't worth his time.   When I go to an \"Italian Authentic Trattoria and Deli\" I don't want to order something \"Italian\" from their menu and then told by two Spanish speaking waiters that I don't know what I ordered. I predict that Sienna will go out of business if they don't hire better waiters that know about Italian foods and what is on their menu. Arguing with Italian customers in an Italian restaurant over Italian food is just plain stupid. If I wasn't with my wife I might have reacted a bit differently and the manager wouldn't have had a choice but to intervene.",

Everything is fresh, homemade (oh, that bread!), sausages, pizza, the sandwiches, hot or cold,  are amazing, and the desserts are incredible.  They even have a wide variety of olives.  They have a deli side and a more upscale dining experience in their restaurant located next to the deli.  We love eating our sandwiches on the their covered porch.  Very relaxing and inviting.

At the bar they have happy hour from 3-7pm and they have really good food! The lamb chops are amazing! I use the anchioade that they give with the bread and smother it all over my lamb! Yummmm! The prima salad is perfect as well! It's arugula tossed with lobster meat and a light dressing. Then it has a red and yellow tomato slice, some grilled shrimp and a fan of avocado! Yum! Those are two of my favorites! I also come here often for my coffee and sambuca Fix! And at the deli I come here often for manhattans and their hazelnut gelato TOOO DIE FORRR!!!! The cannolis are amazing! The Italian cookies are amazing! They have pizelles and so many other Italian goods! I often buy their breaded eggplant, their fresh gnocchi's and fresh marinara sauce then go home and put it all together for a wonderful Authentic Italian dinner! I can't say enough about this place!

    "text": "This review is for the deli/coffee shop: nice place, good food, horrible service!! I started my order at the register, and halfway through I was told that I had to order my sandwich at the food counter, get a ticket and come back to resume my order and pay at the register (thank you for putting the customer needs first over the employees convenience). Once at the food counter the guy with the rock voice ignored me five minutes, although he saw me; too busy cutting his bread. A younger, nicer but clueless guy finally acknowledged me but messed up my order twice. Back to the register where my coffee was sitting for more than five minutes, and it was not decaf although I said it twice, but the female cashier (consistently horrible throughout many visits) insisted that I didn't. What is wrong with this place??! Not coming back.",

It's 50/50 on the service as some times you have to wait a very long time to put your order in and get drinks.  The bus people are great and super attentive, but the wait staff seem to have too many tables or not properly trained.  We do love the food!!!",

The waitress/counter help was not friendly,  kept herself busy with 1 cappucino and a sandwhich order which must have come from the kitchen. Not even a:  I will be right with you to acknowledge a customer! I  had to wait a good 10 min before she even asked me what I wanted and at the time I was the only one standing at the counter. One man came in and walked to the Deli area. There were 2 waitresses in the deli section, one could have come over and helped. Bad customer service! A man with a baseball cap was walking around and went behind the deli counter,  and if that man was a manager,  no wonder the service was bad.",

(Eggs Benny are my favorite) They came and the sauce sad cold, the yolk was almost the consistency of a hard boiled egg.

They offer a full menu on Sundays along with a brunch menu.   We decided on a full meal rather than brunch.  I split the small chopped salad that tasted great!  It was full of fresh cut meats and cheese along with some red onion and garbanzo beans.  All tossed in their great tasting caesar dressing.  I had the rigatoni bolognese.  The serving was HUGE and was incredible.  We were served some bread that tasted fresh!  Service was spectacular!  Our water glasses were filled multiple times.  I look forward to stopping my their deli in the near future or even planning a night out with my husband.  This place has a great warm ambiance.  I noticed they have a nice looking bar too!",

I bought some boxes of frozen stuffed shells made in house and a container of their house made marinara sauce.  The result when I baked the shells was very good.  I took a look at the other frozen pastas they have, and while the price seems higher than supermarkets. I think the quality is higher.  Service was just OK.  Even though it was an hour before closing and no one else was in the store, I had to wait to ask a question until the two young guys on duty finished the conversation they were having.  After looking at me, one of them turned back to his co-worker and continued the conversation.  I was going to give the deli 4 stars, but I deducted one for the lackadaiscal service.",

I chose the Pesci Misto, all grilled to perfection seafood with a side of linguine, excellent. Others had Rigatoni Bolognese, pork belly which had a rich flavor, almost Moroccan and delicious. A whole Braszini fish, served table-side and finally a grilled octopus. I'm told Thursday night is entertainment night and the music was very good. This is a great place, we'll be back",

    "text": "We visited Siena in the past on two occasions and thought it would be a great location to celebrate a birthday - made a reservation in advance just in case since there are 7 of us all-together.  The table was waiting for us on arrival so that was great to not have to wait.   While waiting for everyone to arrive, we decided to order a bottle of wine and some appetizers.  Did not realize that all the advertisements for Happy Hour only apply to the Bar area - not to the main dining room.  Either way, we ordered the charcuterie board and some fried calamari and a bottle of wine. The bread service came with a small amount of sliced bread and a large amount of 'lavosh' and a small ramekin of olive tapenade.  Not enough bread, especially with the meat and cheese platter we ordered.  Had to ask for more as well as some oil and vinegar - this would normally be brought out with the meat platter automatically.  Not the case.  Once the rest of our party arrived, we proceeded to order some salads and main courses.  The burratta appetizer/salad had a good size portion with a few small sliced heirloom tomatoes and olives.  The other salads were nothing to write home about - the Caesar had a large amount of croutons and very little dressing as well as Ruchetta which was a very small portion (although we did order the small) and again, little dressing.  Our dinners came out just as we took our last bites of salad.    One guest had the Linguine Vongole - this was the absolute worst \"linguine and clams\" I have ever experienced.  There was no seasoning/herbs present in the broth and all of the clams that were on top for garnish, had NO clams inside!  No amount of salt and pepper could save this dish.  The Cavatelli con Salsiccia looked extremely dry with very little tomato sauce.  We tried rescuing it with some leftover sauce from the calamari.  It actually looked as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for the rest of the dishes. The other dishes (Rigatoni, Gnocci, Penne Vodka, Ravioli, Lasagna) were all just OK.  The server did come back and ask how everything was so I can say the service was good; however it was not worth sending the dishes back as we were not confident in anything being better.  Being that it was a birthday, I had asked if they could bring out a cannoli with a candle - no problem receiving this however it was the worst cannoli we have ever had.  We could not determine what was in the filling (there was a distinct alcohol taste that we could not figure out).  We asked the server what the filling was made with and were told \"ricotta and cream\".  NO WAY!  My guess, amaretto of some sort.  Overall, what we thought was going to be a great family dinner turned out to be just a sub-par dinner with good company. I can say for sure that we will NOT return.  Clue to a bad dinner:  when you walk out from a $300 meal and need to hit the closest In-and-Out drive thru!!!",

    "text": "Ive tried to like this place, really! Ive put in a solid effort but time after time I'm just so disappointed.   1st time- I sat at the bar for lunch. After waiting almost 15 minutes for the bartender to show up, I ordered a glass of Cab and the Carpaccio. The carpaccio came out 20 minutes later, and it was room temperature. Now after working in Italian restaurants for most of my life I know carpaccio is supposed to be cold, due to being raw meat. When i confronted the bartender about this all she said was \"that's how its served here\" I ordered another glass of wine and didn't touch my meal. When i got the bill i noticed i was charged for two glasses of Merlot. at $16 each & she didn't take the carpaccio off my bill even though it was untouched and I voiced my concern about it.  When I asked her why the Merlot she said \"Oh well that's what i poured you, and you drank it\" I laughed paid the bill and vowed to never return.  2nd time- Firefly was too busy and my friends all talked me into giving this place another try so I did. It was a disaster. Bartender obviously had friends at the bar so we were ignored the majority of the time, and when we got our bill their were drinks on their that were obviously not ours... but couldn't help but notice the bartenders friends were drinking what was on our bill. Nice dude.. real nice.  3rd time- Came in here last night for the live music. And once again... 100% pure disappointment. We were seating in the lounge area and it was absolutely impossible to get service. The little Russian server was not only rude but we kept having to go up to the bartender for drinks because she was no where to be found.  All i have left to say now is... 3 STRIKES YOUR OUT.",

Gina Linzi the restaurants general manager was so kind to take us on a tour of the restaurant and Authentic Italian deli that has every Italian delicacy that you can imagine. From the varieties of formaggio (cheese) Olives from different regions of Italy oh not to mention the Italian gelato and pastries. I can go on and on. You must see for yourself. Gina then proceeded to sit us at the bar area for Happy hour and let me tell you this is not just a happy hr. It was a feast!! The best Italian feast. Gian Carlo the owner was so gracious to proudly serve us 2 great pasta dishes that were out of this world. Along with the fried calamari which was so tender. The lamb chops were sensational every bite was heaven. The variety of cheeses along with figs and fig jam. They do great meat and cheese boards. Great musical entertainment after 830 in bar area. Get there at around seven to enjoy the great experience. Gian Carlo and Gina are great hosts and you will never experience this gastronomic adventure if you Dont get there and try it for yourself.

We have been to several restaurants in the area and this one is the tops. The food is fantastic and so is the service. My wife and I both had the lasagna, because our first time at a new Italian restaurant we always go for the staple. It was perfect, the taste was amazing. I cannot wait to try the other fantastic dishes on the menu. It was my wife's birthday so they gave us a complimentary slice of red velvet cake, which was freaking great. Pasquale was our server and he was fantastic, knowledgeable, and we will definitely ask for him when we return. This was our first of undoubtedly many trips to Siena.",

I've seen big bands, solo artists, folk singers, jazz, you name it. The staff is absolutely, positively like the cast of \"Cheers\" except they are serving gourmet food and concocting delicious martini's and Manhattan's. Todd, the guy who tends bar is funny, very spirited, but above all makes fantastic cocktails. And, seriously...could the staff be anymore good looking?! John Carlo, the owner, he must be there nightly because every time I've been in he's there, but not in a \"boss\" checking up on his staff kind of way, but being a part of what is going on. The food is delicious and as I've been to many parts of Italy, I find this place to be extremely authentic..the food is beautiful and they have a deli to boot!! If you are looking for ambiance, gourmet meals, fancy cocktails and entertainment, but don't feel like dressing to the nines, come here and enjoy a night of pure Italian bliss!",

We were there around 5:30 on a Wednesday evening so we didn't get to experience the live music. That probably would have earned them another star. Doubtful we'll return.

But I am not going to hold that against the place)  The women behind the counter were very helpful and friendly. The cakes... OMG, the cakes!!! We had the Mocha, Chocolate Coffee Cake.

They have it all; a fresh deli case filled with pancetta, mortadella, homemade Italian sausage, olive bar and cheeses to a freezer filled with home-made pasta and a hot entree bar. They offer dry goods that range from jars and cans of imported tomatoes, sauce, bruschetta, peppers and outstanding dry pasta. And they have home-made gelato in your typical Italian flavors... highlighted by the spumoni and pistachio! And don't forget about the bread case... from chibiatta to round, yummy loaves of goodness crispy on the outside and soft inside! A little imported olive oil and you're done!   You can eat in the casual deli... or  the restaurant which is comfortable and unassuming. We came back for the restaurant and were not disappointed. Everything our party ordered was fresh and authentic.  We stared with a different and delicious Ruchetta salad containing arugula tossed with figs and dry ricotta, Champagne vinagrette & figs glace. The cream sauce of the fettachini alfredo was outstanding.  Try the Cavatelli con Salsiccia, a rustic dish filled with a spicy sausage ragout, fresh herbs, tomato sauce & Pecorino Cheese. If you're in the mood for Italian... definitely come here!",

A week ago we went for happy hour, used to love it, but the old guy bartender is horribly slow. We cringe every time we go in and see him working. He got a little busy (not full bar busy) and it was forever for my husband to get a 2nd glass of wine, I tried and my glass was empty for 20 minutes we finally asked for the check...3 times, then had to wait and wait and wait. A couple sat for a half hour waiting to cash out, he held their card, and they had no choice but to wait. I had to ask how long we had to wait before we walked out with out paying, it was that bad.  Tonight we went in for dessert and ordered a full tiramisu. It was made with whipped cream. Not just whipped cream on top, all throughout the cake. Being Italian you know better. It was greasy whipped cream, meaning not fresh homemade whip cream, but the stuff you pipe out of a bag made with hydrogenated oil. Come on Siena Step it up, I know you are better than this (hence the 2 star rating). I've experienced it. Do not cut corners, it just cuts your customers. We won't be back for a long long time.",

So we got seated the waiter came over took out drink order, got the drinks asked about the soups and was told that the soup we ordered had no meat on it got the soup and what do you know it had pork in it asked the waiter and his response was I didn't know there was any meat in there. Ok I know it happens once in a while so he took back the soup and got a different soup which had no meat in it.  On the main entree since it was late we decided to share the steak dish. The waiter takes our order not asking how we want it cooked. Steak comes out looks good and that was about it. Had the first piece which was chewy as gum. Then  took the knife to the second piece and the rest of it was so rare that it was purple inside. Called the waiter over and notified him about this tells us ok I will put it back on the grill to cook a little more. Wow! What put it back on the grill! After we touched it. We were both appalled at this so we asked for the manager.  Manager comes over tell her what the waiter was going to do and just side tracked and said oh we can get you a new dish. No I'm sorry, no the waiter said that by mistake! Nothing. Don't want to know what goes on in that kitchen!  By that time I was already turned off told her just give us the damn check!  One star in for the soup and salad we had otherwise no stars for this place!  This place is CUT!",

I'm not sure who is to blame for the poorly behaved and badly trained wait staff, but one thing I can say for sure, after the fourth visit, is that the poor service and way below average food quality are definitely consistent!  My last (and final) visit to this restaurant included:  frozen, reheated crab cakes, that were disgusting; an 11.00 spinach salad that consisted exactly of spinach, six raw walnuts, and 5 pieces of artichoke hearts;  and then there was the entree.  The entree was our final knife in the gut and pocket book.  We ordered the lobster and steak special.  We specifically asked the waiter for a filet cut of steak.  He served us a small piece of grisly meat that my giant, sharp, steak knife, literally could not cut through!  When we told him it was not filet, he was condescending and rude and acted like we didn't know what we were talking about!  Grrr!    We were highly insulted that they would pass this horrible quality and poorly made menu items off as authentic Italian cuisine. If that is authentic Italian cuisine, no one would ever lay claim to it!  The manager half heartedly apologized, although she seemed more worried about upsetting the condescending waiter than she was concerned about our horrible experience, and she removed the uneaten special from our bill.    I have not ever wrote a bad restaurant review, however, they should not be able to get away with this in a city filled with amazing restaurant options.   I hope that they can address their issues and be an asset to our community in the future.",

The 4 of us ordered from the lunch specials and received the complimentary bread and olive tapenade. The server was very friendly and super attentive, yet again we were the only ones there for the first 30 minutes. I ordered the ciabatta steak sandwich lunch special which came with fried fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were quite tasty, a mix of purple, red, golden and sweet potatoes. The sandwich however, left a lot to be desired. The description was a thinly sliced steak sandwich. What I received was a skirt steak with absolutely no flavor and way too thick to just take a bite of. My first bite extracted the whole slice of meat from the bread so I resorted to cutting the steak piece by piece and eating the bread separately. I wouldn't have minded having to do this if the sandwich had more flavor but it was just blah and boring. The sandwich itself was very large and I was only able to finish one half of it. My friends had the cold cut sandwich, the vegetarian sandwich and the pear salad. They all enjoyed their dishes without complaint. For dessert we all ordered the gelato. It redeemed the meal for me! I had the spumoni flavor and it was creamy and fresh. If I ever return I would definitely order one of the pasta dishes next time.",

This is a great place that my wife and I go to for fresh deli sandwiches.   The service is always quick and pleasant every time I venture in here. All of the meats and cheeses are fresh making the selection of sandwich variations endless and very good.  The pasta salad and the cucumber are our favorite sides and a great refreshing add on during the hot summer months.  Hopefully I will be able to return and sample the dining side to update this review fully.",

    "text": "I visited Siena on Tuesday with a bridal shower party of 16. The private room we were given was beautiful, but that was the end to the perks of the restaurant. The bread service had pita chips and bread with an olive tapenade. It comes in ramekins that hold 1 tablespoon of tapenade, and given to share among 4 people. So, we were pretty much all able to have 1 slice of bread with tapenade on it. Wonderful!  We split an aragula salad which was actually very tasty. It had figs and some tasty cheese, but a tad too much dressing. That was the best part of my meal. My mother-in-law next to me ordered the penne (I think) and the pasta looked homemade. I suppose that's the one up-side of this place. Several of the pasta dishes looked like it was homemade pasta, but me, wanting to be healthy, opted for something low-carb. When it came to ordering, I opted for the salmon with a side of asparagus (4 stalks). My friend next to me ordered the same thing, and we were both incredibly disappointed. The salmon looks like it was butterflied in half so that we each got about 3 oz. of salmon that was incredibly thin. Mine was over-cooked to say the least, but hers was burned. The whole outside was black and charred... Unfortunately, the salmon which came highly praised by the waiter (whom I only saw one time when he took my order), was so small that I ended up starving and eating a bunch of bread just to fill up. So much for low carb.   Since our party was so large, there was an automatic 20% gratuity attached onto it, which would be fine, if I ever got a refill on my water glass. I was so thirsty, I almost drank my friend's water. Sorry, but I will never be back. I think most of the people at my table shared this sentiment. My total for half a of a salad, very poorly cooked, thin salmon, and 4 stalks of asparagus with 20% gratuity was $36. I think I could have purchased a weeks worth of wild salmon and cooked it better myself.",

Finally, my beautiful one and decided to celebrate our anniversary there. First staff is very inviting and attentive. Atmosphere and Ambience was very delightful. We also like the fact that even though there was music playing overhead and people were talking the noise level was very good where we could at least have an intimate conversation without screaming at each other. The menu was very extensive there was a very good variety of choices of authentic Italian food. We started off ordering off of the happy hour menu with crab cakes and shrimp scampi. The food came out an adequate time. The crab cakes were moist very good texture fried perfectly with a small side salad sprinkle lightly with Thousand Island dressing. Shrimp scampi was very tasty season very well and the shrimp melted in my mouth. 4 on tree get the angel hair shrimp and also the veal Milanese. Both entrees were prepared just right presentation was over average. After dinner we had dessert and coffee those two were very pleasing and satisfying nice place to take a special person or the date that you just want to make a nice impression.",

I've been here twice - and I had two totally different experiences, but this place (for the most part) is very well-run, so I'll give it four stars.  The first time I came here was a few Thursdays ago. There was a live band of a bunch of older guys and they were horrifically loud. I actually left the bar and went into the dining room to get away from the awful off-key singing and loud playing. My pasta that night was also a little undercooked, which I was definitely upset about... but the owner came out, apologized and gave a completely new pasta within minutes.   Once I got my food fixed, I then realized Sienna has some of the best Italian food Vegas has to offer!! (FYI, they also have a deli... I took some cold cuts home with me... YUM!)  If you want my advice, come here on a Wednesday... I came last week and there is a guy singing to karaoke tracks but he is actually a very nice man and a very good singer, and he's not too loud unlike that Thursday night band. Also, it's not too crowded on a Wednesday. That's a plus. He asked me if I had a request which I thought was incredibly nice of him. I'm so sorry I can't remember his name, but I assure you he's a very nice kid.  So yeah, definitely come here on a Wednesday. They also have live music on Friday and Saturday nights, but I haven't tried out the other acts yet. I might give it a shot because their food, I assure you, is excellent.",

My 6 year old ate only a few slices of the cheese pizza and this was the first time that he ever did not finish it and he eats a lot of pizza. After sending back the soup and crab cakes, you would think the manager would come over to talk but she did not even though the place was empty. I am sitting on my car writing this with my wife and we both have sudden stomach issues. I would never come back here and suggest that you do not either.",

    "text": "I was recently given this restaurant by a local in the Summerlin area as a must try for Italian. They have an Italian market and bakery attached to the restaurant and make their own bread and deserts.  I opted for an early dinner (Happy Hour time frame). I sat in the bar area and ordered a full meal. The bar was very large and there were about 16 people in the bar area enjoying their happy hour cocktails (40% off) and appetizer specials.  The Spicy fried calamari was a bit over fried. To me, it seemed as if it was frozen and fried out of the box. There was NO spice at all and the marinara that was served with it also had no spice. This dish could definitely use some work.   The Italian Antipasto was exactly as expected. Fresh cured meats, cheese's, etc.   The chicken marsala was very light and well prepared. The mashed potatoes were not too desirable but decent. I think a nice risotto would be a better accompaniment than the \"american\" mashed potato.   The lasagna, my specialty being Italian, was a good portion but a dish full of sheets of pasta. Nice pasta but way too many layers with almost nothing in-between the sheets of pasta. I touch of fresh sliced basil across the top would have given a fresh pop to the dish.   I will come back and try another dish or two but I will not do the lasagna or calamari again.   Cannoli made fresh. Comes with chocolate chips. Didn't seem to have an option. I prefer options like almonds instead of chocolate chips. But, that is just me. The shell was done to perfection and the ricotta chocolate chip center was creamed just right. You must like chocolate and appreciate a perfectly cooked cannoli shell for this desert. It is a must try if you are a cannoli person.  The service was wonderful. Kind, polite, attentive and very helpful.  If you are looking for a good happy hour with a crowd in their early 60's on up this is your spot. Everyone at the bar seemed to be locals and enjoying each others company.",

    "text": "Initially, the service and ambiance were both outstanding. Our waiter, Marco, was friendly and engaging, at first, which is always appreciated and makes it all that more of a memorable experience, only until we had placed our orders with him. I hadn't mind Marco giving advice on what to pair our meal with or what appetizer he would recommend, although he seemed to make the decision for us rather than ask us. It soon became apparent that Marco didn't want to serve us, he would ignore my table even though we were in plane view of him being very attentive towards his other tables. Flagging him down became problematic as the bussers/runners were more attentive and cordial than our own waiter. He casually walked by asking if we were enjoying ourselves, but didn't stay to hear our response. We ordered a seafood pasta, which was fantastic, and a seafood risotto, which had great flavor but came with over baked and dried cod. We had noted it to Marco, not to have the kitchen remake the whole dish, but perhaps remake the cod or just let them know for the next customer they make the dish for, who then told us that we were wrong and that the fish was prepared al dente. Then he had the audacity to tell us to taste it again to see if it's better?? When we told him no that it wasn't going to change anything he immediately told us he'd get a manager. She had checked up on us and apologized on behalf of Marco, but when we tried to flag him down to get the rest of our meal to go, he kept passing us by to tend to other tables. We ended up getting the attention of two runners who took care of it for us and apologized for our server. Marco still would not come to us, seeming to purposefully ignore us like a child. I ended up asking the hostess if it was possible for us to get the check because our waiter seemed to stop providing us service. She informed a manager and apologized on behalf of Marco. (This being the third time someone has apologized on behalf of him). Marco came back to our table with complimentary cake and a noticeable attitude, almost mocking, as if he hadn't been purposely ignoring us. We wish he was more sincere or could have apologized himself rather than have others do it for him. It really seemed like we were being served by a petty child. We left the cake untouched and paid for our meal because we weren't looking for any free giveaways or for our meal to be compensated. Our waiter had turned our whole experience sour, but everyone else seemed like they genuinely understood what we were going through. Perhaps Marco wasn't in a good mood that night, but unfortunately that left a bad first impression for Sienna Italian on us.",

    "text": "The good: the pasta is actually tasty; my ravioli tasted fresh and house-made, as opposed to something out of a frozen package. The filling was also good. The so-so: the sauce tasted like it came out of a can--very basic, uninteresting. The price point is a bit high considering that. The lunch specials do not look particularly good, so I opted for a dish off the regular menu. The awkward: two members of the staff bickered a bit while I was eating. I think that was probably an isolated occurrence though.  Overall, there are some definite positives, and the pasta is a standout. But I wish it came with a better sauce, or a lower price point.",

Then when someone went to seat us it was like he was being put out, and then he became our waiter. In all of the restaurants I have gone to I have never been treated the way we were. Waiter was very rude to us, and took forever for us to place our order. Mind you it was not very busy at 3:15pm on a Wednesday. I wish I had gotten his name, but it was too dark in the restaurant. When we tried to ask him a question he just continually kept walking. I don't know if our waiter was having a bad day, but I for one will never put up with terrible service, and rude waiters. Again we loved the food, but not a way we want to spend our day for a pre valentines dinner. We will not be back. I am just VERY disappointed in this restaurant's snooty service.",

    "text": "Review is for the store/market part of Siena.  I used to come here for their great ricotta. Thought it was Polly-O. They have huge gallons of it you can buy. I just picked up a small deli container. Bring it home - its not Polly-O (wat?!?) flavorless, runny and nowhere as good as the ricotta I got from them at their eastside location. Not sure what's up with that, but from now on I'm getting my (Poly-O) ricotta from the Roma deli on Spring Mtn. Also picked up a, $8 ball of mozzarella. No flavor. What's up with the cheese situation here, Siena. Italian and their cheese are supposed to be top notch, no excuses. At least make your own mozzarella in-house. Come on.    I have ordered their grilled eggplant sammie before (again, from their eastside location) and it was great. Will report back at some point if its still quality on this side of town.   Overall not too happy with my $$$ purchases from the fresh deli side of the house.",

    "text": "Another awesome review for Siena.  I've been going there for years, and in those years I have never had a disappointing experience.  The character of the place, first of all, is fantastic.  The deli counter is lively and bustling, the market area, although small, is crammed full of interesting goodies that beg to be taken home and placed in your pantry, and the dining area with the red and white tablecloths all lend the place a homey feel - if your home happens to be Italy or even Little Italy.  The breads up front always tempt me with their fresh, crusty look and the cheese selection is dynamite, outta sight.  Their lasagna is absolutely heavenly, their Sicilian pizza wins over everything else in town that tries to come close, and the garlic knots will make you unkissable for days but you won't even care because they're that tasty.  Their deli salads are all superb, apparently even the calamari salad. (I am not touching that with a ten foot pole though.)   The most amazing, splendiferous thing about Siena?  They are awesome, honest, just-plain-good people.  One day I lost my wallet there and spent hours panicking.  I called Siena and they hadn't seen it until later in the day someone was sweeping by the register and my wallet had been kicked under the cabinet that holds it.  They found my business card inside and called me at work.  My wallet was returned to me, all eight measly dollars, ATM cards, and identification accounted for.  Visit them NOW, they will rock your socks off.",

If you want to be drench with ice cold water by a busboy filling your water glass, not receiving your change when you pay your bill because the waitress assumes it's her tip and not honoring the eclub coupon, than this is the place for you.  The happy hour bar food was average but prices not so happy.  I can't recommend this restaurant at this time.",

    "text": "I am an Asian addict. I rarely eat anything that does not come from that lovely continent. I mean it is the largest and most populated, so odds are they're going to have some winning cuisines--and they do. But, yesterday, I managed to take myself to Siena, an Italian restaurant.  The interior, while not trendsetting, is nice and clean. They are in the middle of a big remodel as they are adding a patio and some other features, like a deli, which I think will be nice as my understanding is they are going for a more cafe feel for that section. Cafes are a welcome addition to my hood.  The service got the job done but without finesse or flair. Honestly, I think he decided we were not a valuable table when we started out by just ordering water. I was a server once, and I know when a table goes for the tap you start thinking they're cheapos, but, it's just not right. I noticed that he told another table the specials, but not us. We clearly weren't \"special\" material. He didn't refill our water glasses once. Still, the service was not terrible; it just wasn't remarkable.  As for the food, it was good, but not a good value. I was honestly a little excited to see a salad with apples on the menu. I am a sucker for fruit and greens, but when the salad arrived, it had 4 thin slices on the corner of the plate. That is really more of a garnish and perhaps not worthy of a line item mention on a menu. If they upped the apple quotient, I think this could be a really craveable salad, as the cheese, walnuts and vinaigrette were done well. We also ordered the Healthy Choice pasta: organic & whole-wheat angel hair roasted tomatoes, sundried tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and fresh basil. I loved the bountiful, fresh slices of garlic. If I had made this dish at home, I'd be giving myself a big hug. However, I paid $14.75 for it, and the portion was a little small. I am not ready to dole out hugs for that.   To end on a positive note: The breadbasket and olive tapenade were delicious. The bread came out hot and fresh, and it has become quite a challenge to find a hot breadbasket in this town. Those loafs alone are earning Siena 3 stars, but I probably won't return until the cafe is finished. In the meantime, catch me in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Incredible!! My wife and I are so glad that Siena has come to the west side! We used to drive to the other end of town to shop at Siena's market and get a slice of pizza or some ravioli, now they're right in our backyard!     We were there this last Friday night for a birthday party and were fortunate enough to sample a number of dishes we hadn't ordered on previous visits. First and foremost on our last visit was the gnocchi with basil pesto. The gnocchi is far lighter than at most restaurants and the basil pesto was perfect. The pizza was also exellent! Thin, crisp crust made with double zero flour and charred to perfection. The antipasto platter is a great starter for any meal. Our meal ended with my favorite dessert, tiramisu and port!     Chef Giancarlo spent a great deal of time with us and made sure we all had a great time and an excellent meal. He even broke into his private stash of Lemoncello and had an after dinner drink with us. There aren't many places where the owner/ chef spend the time with the patrons that Chef Giancarlo does at Siena. If you like great Italian food and an all around cool spot, Siena is it!    BTW, the wine list is great and priced right.",

    "text": "We hadn't been back to Siena Trattoria for more than a year because last time we were there we weren't really impressed. Today was our 5 year anniversary and we decided to give it another shot.   First thing I noticed upon entering was that they had undergone a nice remodel! Everything looked fresh and clean with modern cool colors. We chose to sit in the bar area as Happy Hour was going on and we wanted to take advantage of the special pricing. However, it was eerily quiet, as there was no ambient music playing and it was very easy to hear everyone's conversations as the tables are very close together.   We found a table easily and were greeted quickly by Todd, who was very knowledgeable about the menu and happy hour offerings. We ordered some wine (a pinot noir and nero d'avola which were both delicious and about $6 each on the happy hour) and some appetizers right away. We were quickly and efficiently served water, a bread basket (which comes with a very nice olive tapenade for dipping) and our wine. Our food arrived quickly as well. My boyfriend ordered the beef carpaccio and cannelloni. I had the eggplant parmesan. I am a vegetarian and the happy hour menu was slightly lacking in vegetarian options so I also ordered  a pesto penne primavera from the regular menu. Everything was delicious but the eggplant was simply OUTSTANDING. The best I've ever had. it was thinly sliced and lightly battered and topped with mozzarella and just the right amount of marinara. Being a vegetarian, I've had a lot of eggplant but this was simply the best. The BF really enjoyed his dishes as well and my pasta was quite good also. I think they may have overhauled the menu as well during the remodel as it was way better than I remember from last year.   The service was excellent, we were offered more wine, our waters refilled and dishes cleared in a timely manner. Everyone was friendly and knowledgable. Our food and wine were incredibly tasty. I docked one star for lack of ambience (no music at all! Not even for background) and I think they are kind of over priced in general but the happy hour pricing makes up for that. I wish we would have had room for dessert, they looked amazing! But we were so full we just settled for espresso which was delightful!   We will definitely be back! During happy hour of course :)",

We stood waiting for attention at the counter for about 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged, but we got our order in, got some drinks paid and sat down to wait for the food, which came pretty quickly. The caesar was great. Our sandwich ( the Siena chicken cutlet) was bland but big. The Cavatelli with Ragout was just as flavorless but considering it was the signature pasta dish according to their posted menu, it was terrible. The Italian dude that served us was cool though and took care of our table. Groovy Italian music videos gave the dining space some ambiance.  Prices have gone up since they posted their menu online.   They seem like nice people and there were some potentially good choices in the deli cases, and we had high hopes after the glowing reviews, especially after getting into the caesar salad, but the experience took a nose-dive with the main dishes. $40 after a tip and a couple sodas for crummy food.  We probably won't make it back to try the pizza. Sorry boys. Overall I'd recommend Tivoli Gardens: It's right down the street, the prices are the same, the food is better and it's an actual restaurant where you're served at a nice linened table.",

They used to have a nice, younger bartender working but we don't know what happened to her.   The restaurant is new and not very busy. I would think that if they plan on staying in business they'd want that old crank to change her attitude or get out from behind the bar.

I was extremely thirsty and asked if he could leave the H2O pitcher on the table since I did not want to wait for refills. He left the pitcher and within a couple minutes he came and took it saying his manager would not allow this.   The food comes and just prior to making room on the table for the plates he coughs into his hand and then moves my silverware. I asked if he was out of his mind and gave me a blank look. I asked him to wash his hands prior to placing the plates and to secure me new utensils.   This place needs to put the guest needs first rather than removing the water pitcher and teach the staff proper food handling skills.",

    "text": "As I'm reading all these reviews - one thing stands out. We are ALL COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SERVICE. I'm sure a manager or owner reads these (maybe they don't and that's the problem) but do something in regards to training your wait staff! I was so excited to try this place for Mother's Day, my husband surprised me with reservations. As we were seated at the booth in the far back next to the kitchen, the waiter, I didn't catch his name (he was a shorter Italian looking gentleman) came over And took our drink orders. My husband ordered a Coke light ice and I ordered a Coke with lemon. Not that complicated. Somehow our drinks came out with ice from the bottom to the top of the glass, and a lemon. First strike. We then ordered our food which came out in a reasonable amount of time considering it was a holiday. I had lasagna and my husband had the fettuccine Alfredo which was made with fresh pasta and I believe pancetta and it was delicious. We were enjoying our meal, and all of a sudden something on the other side of the wall apparently slipped off and splattered on my shoe. One of the waitresses apologized I believe it was in all of tapenade that spilled. No sign of my waiter at all. We finished our meal and I then asked to see a dessert menu, and I was excited to see they had sfigatella on the menu. The waiter wasn't sure if they had any left, went over to the deli side to check, left dessert menus on our table. I found that strange. They were all out unfortunately, so I ordered a small dish of hazelnut gelato. He came back over with a different flavor of gelato, not what I ordered. And a trio dessert plate which he left on our table. We didn't order it. At this point my husband and I looked at each other and were wondering what the heck was going on, because there was a dessert sitting at our table not ordered. And my husband joke to that perhaps this was a Mother's Day offering. The waiter then came back over with my hazelnut gelato, took the other one that I didn't order and also took the trio away without apologizing or saying a word. Very odd indeed. I'm so frustrated because I wanted so badly to love this place, it is less than five minutes from my house in the lakes. The whole experience was beyond strange, and that even spoke to the table sitting next to me, and they were complaining that the waiters forgot to put in part of their food order. I have to say the Hispanic woman that was taking care of refilling our drinks was absolutely wonderful, looking back I should've tipped her directly. I really am frustrated, and I do wish that the owners or managers way to train their staff to be more efficient and communicative. I'm on sure if I'll return at this point. We are enjoying our food yes. Was the service Bizzarre? Absolutely. I believe my husband still has the receipt from the restaurant, and if he does, I may be calling the restaurant today because the whole situation was just very odd. We left feeling confused. The food can be fantastic, but if the service is lacking, we most likely won't be returning. And I'm sure for every person that complains about the service publicly, there's 10 or 15 that don't, and simply will not visit your establishment again. Please do something about this.",

    "text": "I ordered the NY steak and the gf ordered the sausage spagetti, and both the dishes were terrible.  The gf says that \"a homemade spagetti with newmans best sauce\"  would have been better.  I can't disagree.  The NY steak smelled and tasted horrible.  They had to slice up the steak, which is a bad sign right away on a piece of meat.  You wonder if it was too tough or in this case since it had some kind of smell, I wondered if the meat was bad.   I took half of it home and when I reheated it, it had a really really strong meat smell.  They also topped it with some kind of cheese, (cheese on steak? )  but anyways, I just thought it was to mask the smell.    I never rate on establishment, looks, service, etc.  I thought everything was ok.  I go to the restaruant for the food, and what I ordered was lackluster, bad quality and horrid.  never coming here again. ever.  I read a lot of good reviews about the cold cuts.  Maybe thats what I should have ordered. who knows.  But I'm sure not gonna find out.  Edit:  Oh wait, I did like the complimentary bread and the garlic pesto butter.  The shrimp scampi appetizer was okay.  That was standard, until the maincourse  and stinky meat showed itself up.",

At the deli, I've had the Siena sandwich, sausage and peppers sandwich, and the prosciutto sandwich; bruschetta, tiramisu, gelato, and latte. All the food has been really good.   My favorite is the sausage and peppers sandwich. Marinara sauce + sausage + peppers + onions = ONE AMAZING SANDWICH!!  Latte's are strong and very flavorful coffee.   There are lots of Italian-type merchandise products for sale. Olives, pasta, olive oil, sauce, peppers, and etc.   The dining area has very nice interior, but I've never eaten there before. I've had a drink at the bar area. On a Thursday night, the bar was almost completely full.   Tuesday-Sunday's have live bands from 8-close.   Happy hr is from 3-7 everyday; reverse hh from 9-close; happy hour all day Sunday.",

I came in to town to visit family and this place was number 1 on my to visit list. We dined in on a Thursday evening. It wasn't very busy and we were seated right away. The best thing I had that evening was the appetizer of different cured meats and cheeses. It is $24 so a bit expensive, but we shared it among 4 people. You can tell everything is fresh cut and it was just delicious. The other appetizer we shared were the mussels. In December, the mussels were amazing, buttery, and no fishy taste at all. This time not so much. We couldn't even finish them they were so fishy. It was a disappointment for sure. For our entrees I got the linguini with clams. Again, very disappointed. The clams were full of sand and the sauce had absolutely no taste. What a bummer. I was really looking forward to this meal and it just didn't deliver. I am hoping it was an off night for them. I will be back again and hopefully have a similar experience to my December visit. If you do go, splurge for the cured meat platter. It really is worth it.",

The lemon caper sauce is delicious, I always ask for a little extra.  No matter what you order on the special menu, it is fresh and in season and wonderful.  We have friends that we go with quite a bit, and one of our companions orders the Chicken Marsala every time.  It is his favorite dish and he can't get away from it.  Order the charcuterie plate for appetizer.  Onsite they have an Italian shop with meats, cheeses, olives, gelato, and other worldly goodies.  The meat and cheeses on the plate are from the shop.  The portion is very generous - quite enough for four or five people.   The menu is just enough of everything Italian from the appetizers, salads, pizza and traditional Italian dishes.  Everything we have ordered has been fabulous.  This is definitely our \"go-to\" Italian place!",

They say this will be for summer only since this is their slow season. The entire place is very pretty, with the wood fired stone oven in the back, the big bar area, and the deli. We had a large party and I'm not sure how many times we had to ask for refills on the drinks. Is this how they save money? Disappearing act when you order bottomless mimosas?   Nothing pisses me off more than having to buy the complimentary bread at a table. $3.50 for hard crispy bread that comes with preserves that taste like Smuckers. No thanks.  French toast - 1/5 $10 it's like they're trying to hide the fact that the portion size is so small. It's laughable. Cut up strawberries do not hide the fact you gave us a crap portion size for what we paid for. The bread is extremely thin. Just... horrible. It said it was going to come with mascarpone and it didn't.   Pepper and egg sandwich: 2/5 $8.95 Nothing special.  Bread is good but not particularly warm. \"Why is this so expensive?\" Are my thoughts on all the food we ordered. Nobody seemed particularly satisfied with their food in our 9 person party.   The one thing we seemed to agree on was the potatoes were good. That's it. Food was just such shit for the prices.   Please don't make alcohol your strong point of your restaurant.",

The sauce is exactly what I remember growing up and eating in the Italian section of Hartford Conn. Yummo! I think I'll have a pepper, egg and cheese Grinder, Hoagie, Submarine or whatever you prefer to call it. NOW!",

    "text": "The Goods 1. Bakery and deli on one side with small Italian grocery store.  This place came highly recommended by a friend especially the frutti di mare.  They are known for Italian desserts.   2. I loved the bread basket, as I usually do, with the tapenade it is like crack in spread form!! 3. Bruschetta was a little soggy from the tomatoes.  The bread could have been a bit more toasty 4. I had the best best white zin here - Bel Arbor from California.  Usually I don't get anything out of a glass of wine but this one definitely had a taste of grapefruit, and I finally finished a glass of wine.   5. Entree didn't have the best presentation but the piccata sauce was delicious nicely tangy.   6. Desserts are Italian favorites!  I got the sampler   Service 1. Server was great!!!   2. Front desk and bakery was less friendly.   3. I felt like it was harsh, maybe this is Italian style   Ambiance 1. Ambiance in other photos mainly showed the deli but the sit down restaurant is more sleek and modern 2. See photos   MoJo 1. Try everything!  I wanted to try the sfogliatella, but they were fresh out :(",

Since I don't eat meat, they are very accommodating on substitutions. Go early, it gets very busy and noise level escalates. Happy hour: 4:00 - 7:00 with some great appetizers on their happy hour menu.  East side of restaurant is their deli. Get a custom made sandwich for lunch tomorrow or a pastry for breakfast!",

It is literally around the corner and was an excellent choice. Our server, Sebastian, came to our table almost immediately take a drink orders. We were early enough for happy hour so I went with draft beer ($3.75). For my entree, I ordered one of their specials, a lobster tail with shrimp and scallops and  black ink pasta. Always risky to order a lobster tail in a restaurant that doesn't specialize in seafood but I love black ink pasta so I thought I'd give it a try. Great choice! The lobster tail was succulent. The shrimp and scallops were fresh and tasty. And black ink pasta was absolutely delicious. My wife went with a salad and the happy hour baby lamb chops. Also excellent choices. I definitely will return the next time I am at the Village Square theater around dinner time.",

The menu and specials are classic Italian with a modern flair. My family and I have had dozens of meals here, including my daughter's wedding rehearsal dinner. They have also catered 150 people in our back yard. All my experiences here have been 5+stars. We are loyal life time patrons.",

Oh and you have to order the calamari when you go it is nice and crispy some restaurants that I've been to there calamari is soggy and tastes under cooked so I was happy this one was not like that! The wine was light bodied and amazing paired nicely with the steak and my fiance said that the cappuccino here was the best he's every had !",

If you're looking to just have lunch during the week, the deli is unbelievable.   I love the Sicilian, and the sausage & pepper hoagie is awesome as well.

With large group of 12 they were having a hard time deciding where to go for dinner.  Others in the group had suggested going to  Brio but my daughter wanted to make her senior prom the most special one yet.  I had been to Siena a few years ago so I took her to check it out.  She LOVED it!!  It really took some convincing of her friends but she really wanted to get her way....she wasn't going anywhere else but here.  They all had a great time.  She said the staff was so great.  The checks were all split up as needed with no problems, they never had to ask for refills and the ambiance was beautiful.  She said everyone loved their orders with one exception.  The vodka sauce, calamari, other seafood dishes were amazing, but the the lasagna was the only dish that wasn't loved.    I had been nervous sending a large group of teenagers to a nice restaurant.  I was afraid they wouldn't be treated as well as maybe a group of adults would.  I am so pleased that this was not the case!    Thank you thank you thank you!!",

We started with the Burrata and Heirloom tomato followed by a salad (I forget the name) with mixed greens, toasted walnuts, gorgonzola and sliced apples. Entrees at the table were the Veal Piccata, Tagliata di Manzo, a New Zealand Snapper special and a Grouper special. All were exceptional and very reasonably priced. We finished with a couple desserts and more satisfied we could not have been. Service? Probably would have to give that 3 stars. Our server was very nice but not very detail oriented and not very attentive.  We didnt get an appetizer we ordered (which may have not been his fault) and we got a cappuccino instead of an espresso that my sister ordered. It wasn't very busy and for the quality of the food and beautiful decor that they have, I feel the service should be a bit more attentive and professional. I will definitely be back because the food was so good but maybe next time sit in the bar. Live music on Friday was a nice addition too.",

    "text": "Dinner Thursday February 15th.  We decided to go and try Siena.  A birthday celebration.  I brought a small cake and candle for the occasion. More about that later.  2 of us ordered chix parm over angel hair pasta.  Very good. The birthday girl ordered the recommended salmon, grilled over spinach. Great.  I ordered a pizza, good and a small caesar salad.  All and all the food was very good. The service was excellent.  Now let me finish my cake story.  Our waiter served the cake and we all sang, we had a very nice time, that is until the waiter brought us yne bill.  He said that there was a service charge for the cake service.  Not a problem I thought until I noticed the amount.  $20.00 service charge.  $10.00 would have been fine but $20.00 is excessive, no rediculous.  When I asked the manager she seemed puzzled, she said she would check with the manager and just went about her business.  Not a great way to run a business, what due think?  When i handed her the cake upon arrival she did not mention a charge.",

I come here mostly for the deli which serves fresh bread, sausage in and out of the casing, fresh sauces and homemade pasta at reasonable prices.  Fed three people lobster ravioli with alfredo sauce, a baguette, a half pound of sausage(out of casing) and had plenty of leftover sauce.    In the restaurant the food is very good.  I have never had any meal that I could say was a disappointment.  What keeps it from a 5th star is that I have also never had a meal that knocked my socks off.  The staff is always friendly, helpful with the menu and suggestions, and on top of the water and bread baskets.  The seating could be a little more on the comfort side of things but the no frills approach probably keeps the prices from escalating out of control.  I enjoy coming here with the family and it is a good date spot as well.",

I also had to keep reminding the person to bring me things I requested earlier. I finally gave up.  Food? Not great. My entree had over cooked pasta. My dining companion's lasagne had cold meatballs in it. My cookies looked and tasted old. I bit into one and it literally crumbled into pieces. I ended up \"trying\" them all, but eating only one.  Entertainment? A bit loud, but the band was tight and the drummer was amazing.  Do I recommend? Like other Yelp reviewers said, you'd think this place would try harder to present \"authentic\" Italian food when there's so much competition here in Vegas. So no, I do not recommend this restaurant. This was my second visit with the same experience.",

The people are always nice and helpful with all the choices. Now, I've only had lunch here but if the diner is as good as the lunch, I bet its spectacular! I always get the Sicilian Sandwich and it's on the mark, I can't understand how this simple sandwich is so good but I could never get my sandwiches to taste that good. The bread is fresh and the meat well is from the deli so its awesome.    My only complaint would be not having a soda fountain in the deli/lunch area but they do have bottled soda and water    I'm a huge cannoli fan so when I can get one to try I do, they have three sizes sm. med, large so went for the Med not knowing the size difference. I should have went for the large cause the med seemed small. They have a lot of deserts to try and I look forward to trying more. All the frozen pasta I've bought and cooked at home has been wonderful. So, If you want a good sandwich go for the Sicilian or chicken parmesan they are outstanding.",

There was not a morsel of food left in his plate. My friend had  the stuffed rigatoni. She said the flavor was the best she has had in a very long time. I had the special. The Pecchari.

I ordered the chicken parm. sandwhich and some Italian wedding soup,I got my dad the spaghetti and meatballs but had them sub in an arrabiatta sauce to kick it up a notch. both of our meals were very good..the soup was excellent. While I was waiting around for the food I inspected the many items they had stocked on their shelves...everything I looked at had past due expiration dates..that's a big deal for me..it indicates a lack of professionalism and selling items less fresh then they should be because they don't want to dump inventory. they could at least discount  the past due items. then there was also an overall blase attitude like these guys were still in europe..they were authentic they all spoke Italian but they also had the urgency of italians...slow boat from china.....these are the few items I deducted for...",

I try not to be negative or biased at  but the service here started from horrible to ending just plain terrible. When the server came and got our drink orders he wasn't enthusiastic at all. I don't understand why people are in this industry if they don't like their job. It leaves customers with a negative experience. BUT, for this place it was the server, busser and manager. They were not on the same page at all. After like 10 minutes go by, we finally get our drinks. So, I keep my cool and brush that off to the side. 15 minutes go by, we finally get to order our food. When we order, we wanted a substitution for a dressing since we did not like the ingredient with the dressing that the salad came with. The server  gave us the dirtiest and most disgusted look like what we asked for was just plain wrong. Look, food was decent and thats what gave this restaurant 2 stars. Other than that, service = negative 5 stars. When I read some of the reviews of this place being that service sucked, yeah I still gave it a shot here because it could be just a bad apple. After today, the server, busser and manager, they just want your money and don't care about how you get service. GO EAT AT SOME OTHER ITALIAN JOINT, THIS PLACE IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!",

We started with calamari which was so greasy we could hardly eat it. The pieces were literally dripping with grease.  For main course I ordered the special of the day which was seared ahi tuna. It was charred and totally cooked thru. It was more like a tough steak than a piece of fish. I sent it back and ordered the salmon instead. The salmon was burned as well and so salty it was inedible.  Needless to say we left and had to eat elsewhere.  The bright light is the service. Friendly and attentive!

    "text": "Friends in Summerlin constantly share stories of the best restaurants in Summerlin. We hike and they name all the restaurants they eat at. All those restaurant reviews included Siena - The name for the Italian restaurant continues to come up in conversation for their dishes. From the drivers of the Cadillac car clubs that meet at Village Center to City Hall spokespeople who walk the trails of Red Rock outside Charleston on the weekends, everyone including the Las Vegas fire fighters state, \"Siena Italian Trattoria has the best pizza. Their pasta sauces have the most flavor. Siena makes their own pasta - Homemade pasta. Siena has a deli next to the restaurant.\" Christmas Eve after a long day starting in the early morning, we found ourselves near Rabbi Wyne's synagogue to give him a Hanukkah present, and directly across the street was the famous Siena restaurant we have heard about for months. So we literally walked over, which is great about Summerlin, it is one of the few communities in Las Vegas where people can actually walk from the library to the restaurant, from the deli to the grocery store. The most unique restaurant with a terrific wine menu, Siena's deli has smoked meats, grilled meat cutlets breaded, pasta salads, gelato ice creams, fresh baked breads, Italian cookies. The restaurant served up seafood linguine homemade with a white cheese Alfredo sauce combined with steamed lobster, scallops, abalone, clams and grilled shrimp with shaved green onion that added such a nice touch to the white dish as well as taste. Honestly the texture of the linguine was perfect. The chef did a great job. The service was also extraordinary. Many people waited on us. Our table constantly had fresh olive sauces for dipping with new loaves of baked bread brought to our table. After hearing so much about the pastas from friends, we also ordered the hand stuffed rigatoni. Rigatoni rolls stuffed with shrimp and mushrooms into the pasta rolls. The light golden sauce reminded me to the tomato cream for Penne a la Vodka, but had brandy added which tasted different from other tomato sauces.",

    "text": "We came here for a family dinner and while it wasn't a complete disaster, it wasn't good enough to warrant a return visit. The wife's raviolis were probably frozen because the insides were still cold. The presentation of my lasagna was nice -- sitting in a little sauce pan -- but the sauce was a little bland and there wasn't much meat in the lasagna.   They don't have a kids menu but they suggested a slice of pizza from their deli instead of a regular sized pizza. We thought it was a good idea since he doesn't eat much, but after seeing the quality of the \"pizza\" they brought out we regretted the decision. First of all, they forgot the order and we had to remind them. It finally arrived well after the wife and I got our meals. What they brought out was a square pizza that looked like it was made that morning or earlier. They just tossed some cheese on top and reheated it. The quality of it was awful.  We did flag down a manager and voiced our concerns. She was nice enough and apologized, even taking the pizza off the check. They offered to comp dessert but we declined.  The restaurant was packed with plenty of older Summerlin folk. That's neither a compliment nor a condemnation, just an observation. It may be popular with some people, but not with us.",

Only downside was the limited menu - understandable but didn't have carbonara or chicken parm :(.   Caesar salad was overly dressed and seemed to be only the white/yellow end parts of lettuce (not even green lol) and hardly any croutons with it.  Other salad had stale walnuts and was disappointing.   Lasagna was good but needed more sauce. Martini was fine.  Don't know if we would come back, it was just okay.",

They gave us copious amounts of bread to snack on, which was nice. I ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was decent but not nearly the best I've had in Vegas. The spaghetti and meatballs was flavorful, but the meatballs were surprisingly small. They don't have draft beer, only bottles, which disappointed me. They played a lot of sad, slow songs over the speakers, which was kinda depressing. We shared a bottle of red wine, which was just okay. I give it a C for the service, a C for the food, a B for the atmosphere, and a C for the price, because this place should really be rated three dollar signs. Better pizza is available elsewhere, for sure",

    "text": "Lately I've been visiting local Italian restaurants and Siena was previously on my bookmarked but I haven't got the chance to try this place out. Until my most recent visit with my family, because it was my parents 36th wedding anniversary. They wanted something new to try out oppose to the norm and being Filipino my parents are biased to Asian cuisine. However, we decided to try this place out and was pleasantly surprised how delicious the food is. I do appreciate how spacious the restaurant is with 3 separate sections with the bar/lounge to the left once you enter. There is a main dinning room in the middle that had an intimate and modern appeal with a cool looking see-through wine room. Then to the far right side is the quick deli and market with imported Italian food.  Based on our dinner and service. My family and I were impress with the awesome service. Order was taken in a timely manner and came out according to our preference with appetizers to the main courses. The bruschetta was a favorite of ours, especially the fresh diced tomatoes and sauce even the texture of the bread was consistent without being too soggy or crispy. Calamari was breaded just right! So far appetizers were on point. All of our dishes was made just right with Frutti De Mari prepared to our expectations. This was the favorite among the dishes we had including my lasagna order. Layered with equal amounts of meat and cheese and was cooked well without being overcooked and runny. Onto to the desserts, the family got 3 different items: Lemon Ricatta Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Cannoli. The Cannoli was a hit with our party because it was fresh and had a balanced sweetness an airy crisp texture. Will need to come back! Overall we had wonderful time for my parents Anniversary. Special shoutout to the staff, \"Grazie Mille!\" :)  2018 Yelp Review #40",

They pair items with dishes that don't belong togather. We ordered a very simple cheese ravioli it was served floating in butter which at first I thought was water. I thought they had boiled the ravioli and didn't shake it off so I asked the waiter. He explained its a butter sage. Hence why there were 3 pieces of fried sage on my ravioli. I honestly coulda poured the butter out into a small ramekin and dipped some lobster in it. Sage doesn't belong anywhere near marinara. I'm not a chef but it over powers everything.  Wife ordered the flavorless bolognese might as well have been hamburger helper. The chef here is very confused. Italian is simple flavors epic fail. Deli is 5 stars great everything.",

Siena has a welcoming environment, not too loud, but still lively. The service, I thought, was excellent. Our server was Italian, and I found him to be helpful and gracious, possessing a gentle but wry sense of humor.  The app for the table was a big winner - and a surprise. When you order Calamari, in general, it seems like you're simply trying to please everyone at once - and usually at the expense of something great. Yay to Siena for dispelling that prejudice of mine. The dish was tasty, not greasy, and man, there was an ample amount for several nibblers. I also liked the tomato based sauce - which was a tad spicy.  My glass of white wine was refreshing. The second glass was even better (and seemed a bit larger, lol). It was recommended to me by our server - after I shared my tastes with him. Bullseye. Delish.  The entree was a special: Black Ink Pasta (Sciue Sciue) with shrimp and scallops. Though the red sauce also had some bite to it - it was very different from say, an arrabiata. (And yes, different from the dipping sauce from our appetizer). The Sciue Sciue was hearty, flavorful and I really liked it. Might be nit picking, but i wish there were just a tad more of the accompanying seafood. But, still a good dish that I'd definitely recommend.  I look forward to coming back sometime soon. And someday, coming by their retail store to pick up some pastas, sauces, and more.",

For my main, I had an ortolana pizza w/ eggplant & asparagus ($14).  Siena offers a lot of sandwiches, salads, pastas and pizzas.  In addition, they have a deli adjacent to the restaurant.  First of all, the salad was very good.  You don't often see figs in a salad, and the sweetness contrasted well against the peppery taste of the arugula:  4 Stars.  On the other hand, the pizza was just OK.  The toppings were tasty, but the crust lacked any character.  In addition, the toppings weren't evenly distributed, and there wasn't enough to cover each slice:  3 Stars.   Our waiter Tracy was very good.  He was friendly, attentive and on top of things.  Any special requests were filled quickly:  4 Stars.  Likewise, the ambiance is nice.  There is a large bar area to your left as you enter.  The main dining room is straight ahead, and the deli is to the right.  A nice feature in the dining room is a large wine display separating it from the deli:  4 Stars.  If you find yourself in the area, bag the rec for Nacho Daddy across the small side street.  Siena has very good food at reasonable prices, and the service & ambiance to match.  Plus 7% cash back w/ Yelp checkin and your credit card linked to your account.",

Don't come here if you think they will take time to sing Happy Birthday. The manager didn't even stop by the table to say hi...pathetic. No hospitality here.",

The dip that they served with this bread was so good! I think it was made with black olives (which I'm not usually a fan of) . The dip doesn't look appetizing but looks can be deceiving.  I don't know what else was in this dip but I couldn't stop eating it. I asked for seconds and on a side note the following week I made a special trip to their deli next door and bought more of it!  I also had some minestrone soup while I was waiting for my entree. The soup was delicious with the fresh grated cheese on top of it. We also had the bruschetta to share. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. I tried their special which was a seafood pasta in a cream sauce. It was good but I really just wanted more bread and dip!  We ended the meal with their dessert sampler which are regular sized desserts. When we asked the waiter what the choices were he said basically it is whatever they have left over. Our dessert platter came with canolis, cheese cake, tiramisu, and a chocolate mousse. They were so good!   The restaurant and the deli have a nice ambience. The service was awesome! The waiter is the one who told me that they sell the dip in their deli so he was up there in my book.  I want to go back sooner than later and try more of their menu!",

    "text": "Sfogliatella, Italian pastry perfection!  You know you have a VERY good friend when they share snacks like this with YOU!  Especially when these beautiful tasty morsels are no where to be found within 2,500 miles.  My girlfriend from Naples LOVES these treats...but she is so loving and giving that she shared the only one in her possession, (which her most wonderful husband hauled all the way back from California) with me. We sat there and split it, did not speak as we licked our fingers until every crumb was gone.  We just stared at our empty plates with despair.  Knowing we would never be able to eat this again for months, maybe years to come.  We started planning a trip to Italy, which can't come soon enough!  I don't usually get a sweet unless I can share it.  If I have to choose between dessert and a glass of wine when it comes to calories, wine usually wins.  But this treat is not too sweet, it's just simply amazing.  Fast forward to this morning...Siena, half restaurant, half bakery/deli, in Summerlin. We arrive mid morning to find the case empty!  OMG, shouldn't have stayed out so late last night, we missed it!!!  Why couldn't we get here earlier?!  So many reasons, too many to count...at any rate sadness turns into happiness as soon as I explain my despair to Fabio.  He tells me wait 30 minutes, he will bake more! Really?!?! Of course we will wait.  I'd wait all day for this amazing creation.   Walking around their take out gourmet food section could easily take half an hour!  Salami, cheese, prosciutto sampling cut to perfection.  The couple at the table next to us, from Milan, happily sharing their pistachio mortadella and piping hot baguette with us!Exactly 30 minutes later...voila! Fabio returns with lattes,  cappuccino's and 4 piping hot sfogliatella's!!!  6 more made to bake at home to go! All magically appeared and disappeared all within one hour of being in this authentic Italian bakery/deli.  I have to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming.  This pastry was done to perfection!  Not sweet, cream filled, flaky, hot, crispy and ooohh soooo gooood with the strong Italian espresso.  Just what we needed.  If only I could only learn to make these little wonders at home.  I ask Fabio to explain...his hands fly up in the air!  Much too difficult!",

Top it off with the Veal Piccata you have perfection. We've also sat in the bar, had a nice glass of wine and some appetizers.

The ravioli had crispy sage and brown butter. And the sausage pasta was spicy, and a good sized portion. With two glasses of wine, and dessert, our bill for three people was $80.

As an East Coast transplant, this place really makes me homesick, by nourishing that part of me which misses all the little Italian delis and bakeries I would find back home. From the assorted bread, to the fresh pasta, the snacks and the hard to find antipasti. The prices are definitely high - you're in a desert oasis and they've imported most stuff from ITALY. So, I splurge here because it's worth it. And if we go often enough maybe the prices will go down.   My absolute must-haves: biscuits (aka biscotti), pasta (dried, best prices!), cheese (marscapone best price anywhere!), torrone, pizza (literally the best in Summerlin). They even carry great cooking tools like paellas (the pan used for making paella), pasta machines, ravioli cutters, etc.   When I came upon this place I nearly fainted. I wish the deli would triple in size! My hopes for the future: create a wine section, maybe some on tap, have a bigger pastry selection. All-in-all, love this place and it feels like a hidden gem.",

The lady at the reservation desk was rude about it until I told her that my husband was home from deployment and had not seen him in five months.  While I understand Valentine's Day can be very crowded but with proper planning their restaurant would not have been such chaos. When the waiter came and took her order I specifically told him a New York steak medium rare, he delivered a cold Gristle laden rub eye that was 75% fat the hors d'oeuvres were cold and not fully cooked and my husband and I ended up taking a few bites leaving the restaurant still hungry. I seriously would not recommend this restaurant to anyone!",

They have a deli where you can buy fresh baked bread, desserts, pasta and almost everything that you enjoyed in the dining room!  Happy hour is in the lounge from 3-7 pm Mon-Saturday and ALL DAY ON SUNDAY!! Yes you heard me right! Lots of delicious food options, and wine is 40% off by the glass. They have lunch specials but I ordered from the regular menu coz I am a sucker for gnocchi. Their pesto cream gnocchi is to die for.. tender, melt in your mouth and they are so generous with their delicious sauce. Complimentary bread basked has warm fresh baked bread with olive tapenade. Dessert selection is huge, I tried cassata cake which was good but a little dry. Cannolis are delicious!",

    "text": "Walking in was confusing cause of the two different sides of the building with the deli shop and the restaurant but it got figured out. I was automatically iffy about how the staff was the second I got in there.  The entire menu is extremely overpriced. I was so confused on why it was so pricey but assumed it was just because the food must be that good to where it would make sense. First thing was the drinks which the soda was very flat and also 3.00 which is crazy for just a soft drink. The bread came after and it was pretty good but the only good part about the whole thing. After ordering, it took about 30 minutes to get our food and again, I assumed it was because it was good food and just took time to make...  When getting the food I got way too excited and just got disappointed being that both me and the person I was with weren't happy with how it came out and what we were expecting. It was super dry and chewy and didn't have much flavor.  Also to add onto the rest of our experience with the staff, we were uncomfortable the entire time because they were giving us dirty looks and staring and even would stare at us while talking making it obvious that they were speaking about us.  For the price, how the staff was, and how the food was, I definitely will not be returning and will not recommend it to anyone. Could've gotten cheaper food for way better and with better customer service.",

The deli and store offers a large selection of hot and cold Italian food to take to go or enjoy on site. They also have a large case of Italian desserts and cookies. The market has fun items for Italian cooking.  I went with an Eggplant Parmesan Sub for my lunch.  My husband had the Chicken Parmesan Sub. We both thought the subs were okay. There wasn't anything special about either sub like an awesome red sauce or special bread. The Italian Cassata Cake was also okay, but again nothing special.  The Italian cookies looked delicious and I was excited to get an assortment to take home. None of these were great and some lacked any flavor. I threw most away because the lactation cookies my doula baked for me were much tastier.   Positives were the outdoor patio seating and that the food came out quickly.",

We browsed their little shop shelves they had a lot of authentic pastas in the box and it was surprisingly reasonable for it traveling so far (east coast I assume) to get there.   Some of the stuff I remember from my childhood like the blue and yellow box of pasta my grandparents used being Portuguese.  I ordered the cold Italian sandwich (back in RI we call them grinders).  It was very good for the $5.49 and the bread was so delicious!  My boyfriend had the eggplant Parmesan because it's his favorite as he's Italian.  It was maybe a 10 minute wait which wasn't long at all for the hour it was, guess we caught them before the dinner rush.  Their bakery and deli has amazing dessert on display!  Wow, they only thing I was sad about they didn't have semi sweet cannoli I guess that's an American thing?  But they sold the shells if you want to make them at home!",

    "text": "The food here was very disappointing. I wouldn't describe anything as bad necessarily, but it was all very very mediocre. I ate with my girlfriend and each of our moms, and we all shared calamari, chicken parmigiana, lasagna, a calzone, and linguini alfredo.  I don't like calimari, but my girlfriend and her mom both love it. They usually can't get enough of it, but this time they left about 20% of it. I saw some left and said, \"you guys don't want to finish the calimari?\" and they just kinda shrugged.  Also, the bread. It was kinda hard and crunchy. I'm a big bread person and I really didn't like it. It didn't come with butter or olive oil, which I thought was weird, just this odd green spread that I've never seen before.  The calzone was the best part of the meal, and I'd just describe it as fine. It was nice and warm, but I thought it was too thin and bread-y, and the red sauce was just very mediocre. Plus they barely gave us any red sauce, but they did happily give us more after I requested it.  I love chicken parm and I thought it was definitely below average here at Sienna. The chicken itself didn't have a nice fried crispiness on the outside and overall tasted pretty bland. I love when chicken parm comes with nice fresh mozzarella on top, bu my the mozzarella wasn't fresh tasting or flavorful. Same with the red sauce. It came over a bed of pasta. It was dry pasta, not fresh. And it could have been cooked a bit more al dente. It was fine, but not what you'd want from a nice Italian restaurant.  The lasagna was worse than the chicken parm. They pasta was on the mushy side. And like everything else just wasn't very fresh or flavorful.  And the alfredo was even worse than the lasagna. I'd definitely describe it as \"bad\". The pasta was weird, it was kinda mushy and stuck together. I've screwed up pasta like this at home before. It happens when you don't stir it and it sticks together and gets mushy. The Alfredo sauce itself was just not fresh or flavorful. It came with ham. I would have preferred the ham to be at least slightly browned on the outside. It tastes so much better that way. There was no browning or crispiness. And the dish really needed some sort of lightness to complement the creaminess. I think sweet green peas are great with it, but at least some parsley would have been better than nothing. For visual reasons too, i forgot to take pictures, but the color was just the white sauce and some pink from the ham. Some green sprinkled in would have made it \"pop\", both visually and taste-wise.  For desert we got a flourless chocolate cake, and tiramisu. I'm not a tiramisu person so I'm not sure how to judge it, but I didn't care for it. The flourless chocolate cake was really weird. It was like a mix of cake and frosting, but somehow also tasted dry. Idk how to describe it.  Aside from the food, everything was great. The decor was really nice, and the service was good. But food is what ultimately matters, and the food was very disappointing. I really wouldn't recommend Sienna.",

    "text": "Came here last night for our office holiday party. This was our first year in the past 3 years we decided to give a different restaurant a shot and I am pretty disappointed because we all really wanted to like this place more than we did as it was much more expensive per person and no open bar.  -The service was decent -The amount of food was so small! One table only had 4 people at it so they got lucky and were able to eat enough to feel full--but the rest of the tables had 5 or 6 people and they brought out family style plates of everything that was very small portions for the amount of people at those tables, so they were left feeling very hungry and had to go out to eat again afterwards. -They took away our plates and forks without asking if we were finished eating, so my boyfriend had to eat with a serving spoon because he was still hungry...but h eventually gave up because that's awkward and made him feel uncomfortable haha. -Same thing happened with the desserts. There were 4 pieces of different desserts brought out to a table of up to 6, so it was kind of difficult to share and awkward to share since it isn't like this was a family party! It's a work party with significant others who are not familiar with people at their table! -The food itself was decent, but nothing stood out to me personally... but I didn't get a chance to try the chicken and mushroom dish (not enough food) and people said that was good. The cheesecake dessert was good though.  Overall, the major disappointment was the food for the price. The family style serving was awkward, but I would have felt better about it if they at least gave bigger portions of food.  Many of us were left feeling hungry...However, the food was decent and the service was okay. The restaurant itself looked really nice too. I think coming here for a normal meal would be good though!",

    "text": "Maybe because we had a larger party so tip is automatically included but our waitress wasn't super attentive to us. She was nice but maybe too busy to serve a larger group?  I had to flag her down a couple of times for water. We went for happy hour and our bill was also calculated wrong.   The food for happy hour was actually pretty good. I loved the calamari and the lamb chops. The lamb chops weren't gamey at all and both portion sizes were great.   Definitely the best out of the dishes we tried. The bruschetta was delicious, crab cakes were ok. A little over fried and not enough crab flavor.   The shrimp scampi needed some more garlic in my opinion but the shrimps were big and juicy.   Their cheese pizza is also not bad as well. The sauce is a little on the sweeter side though.   I would come here for happy hour again. The food was not bad but don't expect a great culinary experience.",

It literally stuns me that people choose to eat here when there are dozens of amazing Italian restaurants within a 5 or 10 mile radius (Roma deli, chef Marc's...)   We had the lasagna and the fettuccini. Pretty basic right?  $17.95 each...which is way overpriced...for the tiny portions and tasteless food we were served.   The fettuccini literally smelled of flour and was so tasteless...it was mind boggling. I never add salt to my food...EVER, but this plate of pasta had me double fisting BOTH the salt and pepper shakers.   My husband at the lasagna...he didn't say it was good or bad...but he did say \"we don't need to eat here again.\"   The bread was good. Maybe it was just relativity. I'm not sure.   Needless to say, I won't be back.    I feel very bamboozled by all of you who park your car out front and eat here...I assumed that a busy restaurant (from what I saw) meant delicious food. I was wrong and am hugely disappointed with my experience.",

Don't know why, because they were not too busy and it was at 7pm.  The food portions are small, but the food was good.  I never got a refill for my water glass, even though it sat empty the entire time after the initial pour.  Although I did not ask for a refill as I am pretty passive.  The lasagna was super hot on one side, and just luke warm in the middle.  I don't complain much, so It was ok.  I live close by and will try them again and update my review.",

From the front of the building, the deli is on the right and the restaurant is on the left.   I ordered a \"Sicilian Sandwich\" priced at $6.99 and a \"Meatball Parmigiana Sandwich\" also priced at $6.99 for hubby since he was lost looking at the bread loaves they had for sale. The girl behind the counter gave me a receipt and said I needed to pay the girl at the front. Heading towards the front I noticed some yummy looking desserts and decided to get a slice of \"Pecan Cheesecake\" priced at $4 per slice. Hubby picked out a focaccia loaf that cost $1.90 and we were set.   The Sicilian sandwich was really good! It didn't look like there was much to it, but it packed a lot of flavor. Half way through our sandwiches, hubby and I decided to switch and the meatball sandwich was cheesy, delicious and something I would order again, but I liked mine better. I had the pecan cheesecake later for dessert and it was much better than other places around put out. The focaccia loaf however wasn't fresh. To be fair, we did come in just after 8 pm, so the bread was maybe baked earlier in the day, but they should mark the baked goods down after a certain point. I enjoyed the sandwiches and dessert enough to return!   Inside was clean and the employees were very friendly and helpful.",

I always see the parking lot packed with cars when driving by so my wife and I decided to check it out.   The deli & bakery side has glass cases of breads, cakes, cookies etc. I originally wanted a sausage sandwich (the sausage is made fresh at the restaurant) but they were out for the day so we ordered a meatball and Sicilian sandwich. Both were good and affordable. The meatball sandwich was cheesy and the sauce had a good taste. I don't know how many meatballs are supposed to come on it but they weren't shy with them at all. The Sicilian sandwich had a lot of flavor for not looking like much. There was either an Italian dressing or maybe oil and vinegar on it but whatever it was I liked it. The bread on the sandwiches was good but I picked out a loaf of bread from the bakery and it wasn't as soft and fresh tasting as I hoped for. I will pick out a different kind next time and give it a try. Good to know there is another solid sandwich in town.",

We have passed by many times, but never really noticed this place.  So walking in, we were surprised by the deli.  The display cases full of sweets and other treats including wonderful sausages and fresh made pastas.   They also serve cooked items, for a take home meal.  And of course there are loaded shelves with various grocery items.  After a lingering walk through, we made into an almost empty restaurant.  I think we may have been the second table.  It was early evening but I was still a bit concern with no dinner crowd.  Our server came right away and we made a couple of appetizer selections.  I tried the polenta sauteed porcini.  Loaded with mushrooms and assorted seafood on top of grilled polenta.   It was very savory good. They had just cooked off some homemade sausages and brought us a \"wheel\" gratis.  I love sausage, so this was a wonderful addition to the meal.  For my entree I got the \"zuppa reale\" which is a bouillabaisse with seafood, in fish broth and chopped tomatoes.   It was a bit spicy and very good especially with the assortment of breads to soak up the broth.    The server and the assistants were quick on service, kept our tea glasses full and promptly removed our empty plates.  We admit that it was really good meal, and we do want to return soon.    One of the menu items that might entice us to come again, is the high protein meal, called Misto Carne Alla Griglia, marinated grilled homemade sausages, pork ribs, chicken and steak.  When we are low \"carbing\", this would make a great meal!",

    "text": "I recently moved to Las Vegas and had a truly delightful experience at Siena Italian restaurant yesterday, one which I am still contemplating. For some time now I have had a deep feeling of sorrow of times past when one could go to a restaurant and have a REAL meal and enjoy a feeling of authenticity with both the food and with who is serving you. An authentic Italian meal where the meats are processed on the premise, the pastas and breads are made fresh and the server, a True Italian gentleman, explained the meals and offered to change whatever I may not like.   I loved everything. The food was real food, prepared like it has always been done for generations. The atmosphere reminded me of my childhood when my family would go to a nice restaurant. It was a privilege to dine out and we would dressed up, always on our best behavior. I remember then the linen table clothes and the servers attention to detail. The fresh dinner rolls and so on. This place has the same ambiance.   This place, it is not just a restaurant, but a place out of time to give you the gift of memories, whether the atmosphere triggers it or the food itself...this place made me feel at home for the first time since I moved here. It made wish that I was Italian for just a bit.:) I had remarked to my husband that I couldn't remember the last time that a meal made me this happy, where you moan with delight...certainly the Torta Lunga did that for both us!   This is the place to bring your friends and family too. I am also delighted to read that they also have bands that play on certain days in both the mid morning and evening.  After our lovely dinner we browsed the deli area and felt so blessed to have this deli/ restaurant down the street from where we live.   Thanks to Pasquale for a wonderful experience. Deborah",

The service was slow this time which hampered the evening. I encouraged ordering the lamb chops since we enjoyed them on another visit. This time they lacked flavor. The happy hour salad was okay but was drenched in dressing. We appreciated the birthday girl's free tiramisu but why didn't the waitress tell us when the birthday girl ordered the cannoli's? My friend was disappointed in the crab cakes. It was not an ideal visit. I will consider returning since other visits were enjoyable.",

Served the kids first then the adults which was nice since they were getting antsy. Food was delicious. Only minor complaint was it wasn't very busy and service was on the slow side; however, no one botched up orders, brought us anything we had asked for and always remained courteous. Thank you. Id love to try something new next time!",

She rolled her eyes and said well it's going to take 5 minutes or so, I said, \" That is fine, I can wait.\"  She wasn't pleased.   Lucky me she really was our waitress. *eye roll*. She rushed everything, [wasn't that busy, might have had (4)4-tops that were being used as deuces, save one that happened to be an actual 4 people.  Then I asked if the calamari had tentacles in it, said I didn't want it if it didn't, she said yes, plenty. Out it comes with 1. I'm not kidding 1. What in the name of calamari is that, you said plenty!   Then she seemed upset we asked for wine and then more bread. I asked for more bread because the calamari sauce was bland, the lasagna I ordered lacked flavor as well (next day it tasted a bit better in microwave) and well, her crappy attitude was making me lose my appetite.   I tipped her 15% because I can't go less and told myself I will come back another day and see if it's any better!",

The Siena deli is now by far much more organized, lavished and beautiful.  However, their sausage is now a whopping $7 bucks a pound (it use to be $4-5 per pound)........but no biggie, everything has gone up.  I was so excited to taste it, so I get home, my hubby makes his sauce opens up the bag to add the sausage and first thing I notice is the sausage has no color (hot is usually red from the pepper and spice) and just by the look we can tell it is not the same quality and not to our surprise the flavor is not the same either.  The new product is mediocre, boring, and basically tasteless....total bummer and a big disappointment.  If you step it up & spice it up, we may be back but for 7 bucks a pound it better be made with kurobuta pork.  Too bad, it is so sad to see that another good ole Vegas establishment gone bad.  Adios to the good ole Siena that once was:(",

I'm giving it an ok rating because I didn't experience the best tasting food at the time.  I got an Italian sandwich.  The bread was a bit big, and the bread was a bit stale like it should be with that type of bread, but it cut the roof of my mouth.  The sandwich wasn't anything great in particular.  The stuffed calamari didn't really smell right, and it was cold when I ate it.  I took it to school, but there wasn't a microwave around so I had to eat it like that.  Not sure if it was supposed to be like that anyways.  The food is an ok price.  The worker was very friendly, but when I asked what was good, the only response was that \"it's all good.\"   Haha I understand that, but usually I need a bit more help than that.  I'm going to give it another try and hopefully my second time around will be a bit better.",

So, I went with a frame of reference based on Italian restaurants and deli's I have eaten at back home in Texas. I took my fiance there for a nice Sunday lunch and at first I was bit intimidated by the atmosphere because it seemed a bit pretentious but once our waiter arrived, he put us at ease. They had different specials and they all sounded so tasty. We ended up getting 2 appetizers-The Burrata and the Buongustaio. I also got an entree -Penne alla Vodka- Prosciutto Sauteed with Vodka in a Creamy Tomato Sauce. I was stuffed beyond belief. My second visit to Siena was again on a Sunday but this time I went into the deli to order a sandwich. Well I ended up ordering The Sicilian Sub and Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella platter doused with olive oil. OMG! This is the food of the God's! Comfort food, but on a higher scale. I wish I could make this food at home but I'm pretty sure it wouldn't turn out the same. That is why I will defer to the experts at Siena. This classic Sicilian cuisine with a relaxed atmosphere and they treat you like you are sitting around the family table. Totally worth the money!",

I have notified Las Vegas Metro Police of the employees I believed were involved in credit card fraud and never went back. A very nice environment  and owner but beware of the employees.

    "text": "This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Las Vegas.   I usually order a chopped salad to start. Get the smaller size or share the larger size because there is plenty. The meats and cheese they use in the salad come from their own deli next door. The salad is always fresh and tasty. A creature of habit, I usually order the linguini vongole for my entree. And it never disappoints. Lots of clams still in the shell and the linguini is excellent. My wife has tried a wider variety of things on the menu: rissoto, sausage and peppers, lasagna, and spaghetti bolognese. She has been pleased with all. My only complaint was the dessert we ordered to go. It was the non-flour chocolate cake. I'd describe it as a sliver. But we have had their creme brulee, and it was good.   The atmosphere is relaxing with lower lighting and darker wood. In the evenings, there is usually a singer in the large bar area. The music ranges from the '40's to the '90's.   All in all, we consistently enjoy a nice meal and relaxing atmosphere every time we dine here.",

We ordered the carpaccio which was very good, however, this one had horseradish which makes some bites a bit overwhelming. I ordered the pesce plate and it was horrible! The pieces of fish were lacking flavor. In addition, the fish was charred so i was not a big fan of the flavor. Even the vegetables were not very good!

Now that Sienna moved across town everything has changed. The bread is more French than Italian (the crust makes the difference). We ordered their classic sub which is more like a lettuce sub now. There was no oil, vinegar or mustard on very dry bread. We also ordered cannolis that ended up smothered in a cheap, waxy chocolate syrup which completely ruined them. I tried scraping the chocolate syrup off but it was too sticky. I added my own oil, vinegar and mustard but only one slice of each meat was invisible to the amount of thick bread. What was once a staple in my household is now a distance memory. Not one of the original staff was there (family run business) so I assume they sold it to people who are not Italian.",

Our server (Liliya) knew the wine list as well as the menu items. The Rigatoni Bolognese was fantastic/flavorful. The spaghetti and meatballs were delicious and plentiful. I'm not much for describing food but I know what I like and this was very good.   The lounge is very open and friendly with plenty of seating at and around the bar. The deli is fun to visit and have lunch with an attached wine room. The dining room is spacious and has a warm feel to it off of the kitchen.  This stand alone Trattoris and Deli (not in a strip mall) is well worth the visit as the food is interesting and the service top notch.",

There were 6 of us and we were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  We started off with calamari and bread and tapanade.  I was told the bread is baked fresh daily onsite and I was not disappointed.  The tapandade was muah muah good.  I could not get enough of both!  I thought to myself if the bread and tapandade were that good enough to make me do my happy dance in my seat then the food must be amazing.  I was not disappointed!  Everything we ordered was delicious.  Especially the housemade sausage that came with Hubby's meal.  The staff was all very attentive and we never had to ask for anything.  Water and drinks were always filled.  Even the owners came by to ask how we were doing.  This place is a class act.  Highly recommended!",

A live band was playing. What caught my attention was the flyer for F1 which I'm crazy about. Ferrari, F1 and food...I was in a very happy place.  After the bread service with olives, we got 4 different cheeses (Fontina, Fontinella, Locatelli and Pecorino), gnocchi al pesto and lasagna. I wanted carboncino but they were out. We ordered the Pecorino with truffles but was given pecorino pepato instead. I knew there was nothing that tasted like truffles on that cheese plate we got.  Gnocchi al Pesto: I love gnocchi and pesto so it was an easy decision to get this. Huge serving and lots of sauce. We were using bread to get rid of the excess pesto. The gnocchi was tasty and soft and the sauce was quite good. I don't know of any other places in Vegas that has gnocchi in pesto. 4/5  Lasagna: Their version brings back great childhood memories when we'd go to this small restaurant that serves good lasagna after going to a funeral or the airport. Tasty. The outside was hot but the middle wasn't. 3.5/5  We ended our meal by admiring and taking pictures of cars at the parking lot. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Alfa Romeo and few Fiats. Who needs dessert?",

Once we sat down the first thing we noticed was this think white paper covering the table cloth. Almost like construction paper thick, I felt like I was back in grade school sitting in the lunch room. We had looked at the menu online before we went to make sure we knew what we wanted. They had a \"special\" Valentine's Day menu, on this menu everything was about $10 more than the menu they had online. They brought us out some bread and a spread, which was very good. We asked for some oil and cheese to go with it. They literally brought us an open bottle of olive oil and a plate of shredded cheese.... never seen anything like this before. I ended ordering the lasagna and my girlfriend ordered the tomahawk pork chop. The portions were pretty small, but the food was good. It this place worked a little more on presentation of itself and its staff it would have gotten a better review from me. Until then, I'll look for another Italian place to get me pasta fix.",

Prior to going for dinner, I'd read a review that a customer experienced poor service that she felt was due to her party not ordering cocktails with dinner. I thought nothing of this review until we experienced the same. Upon our arrival to Siena (about 7:45pm/Saturday night) we were greeted by the bus boy immediately. Unfortunately the waitress arrived much later. We noticed she would disappear for long periods on this seemingly un-busy evening. After we ordered dinner (no cocktails) we became famished. It took over 50 minutes for our Shrimp dishes to prepare. We prepared to walkout however the food arrived at that very moment. Our plan was to have dinner then take in some cocktails/music at the bar afterwards. Despite the poor service we stuck with the plan and had martinis at the bar. The atmosphere (new decor) and the music were a nice touch but not enough to alleviate the poor dining experience. We won't be back. I should add that my husband NEVER complains. On this occasion he actually directed me to take the time to share our experience with others. Choose another Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "I'm perplexed by the Las Vegas Review-Journal readers who perpetually name the Olive Garden as Best Italian Restaurant, especially when there are so many better Italian restaurants in this city. And Siena is among the best I've been to.   My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner last night. Happy hour was in full swing in the bar, but we chose to sit in the restaurant. They have half-price bottles of wine on Tuesdays, so that was a bonus! We split a bottle of Sangiovese, which was also offered by the glass. And then we perused the menu, which offered the old classics along with a few modern twists.  Although we weren't too hungry, we couldn't pass up an appetizer of four meats brought over directly from the deli next door. We chose mortadella (fancy bologna), prosciutto (fancy ham), sopressata (fancy salami), and bresaola (fancy chipped beef). My husband is crazy about mortadella, and he said this one was great. I'm not a big fan of mortadella (although I did try a slice), but I really liked the other three meats, especially the bresaola. The meats were served on a long platter with a few olives as garnish. They also offer an assortment of cheeses this way; too bad they don't have a mix-and-match meat and cheese platter as an option. (I guess you could create one yourself, but I didn't see anything offering less than four choices, and four meats and four cheeses would have been a lot for just us two.)  For our entrees, I had the ravioli burro e salvia, which is cheese ravioli served on marinara and topped with a brown butter sage sauce. I liked this a lot, although I could have done without the marinara; the butter sauce was fine on its own. My husband got one of the daily specials: riblets with a side of pasta. An Italian restaurant is the last place I would expect to find riblets, but these certainly fit in with the Mediterranean-themed menu. They were lightly seasoned and grilled over the wood fire, and the pasta was nicely dressed with parm. Sides and salads were extra, and we had neither, although we didn't really need them because we both ended up taking home leftovers.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food would make any True Italian proud. I can't wait to go back to the deli to pick up some bresaola (and some mortadella for the spouse), or maybe stop in for happy hour to try half-price apps and drinks. Now if we can only get some of those Olive Garden fans through the door!",

The menus above the counter are extremely small, so bring your glasses if you're as near-sighted as I am. I let my friends order for me (I'm not joking - I literally couldn't read anything). They chose the Garden sandwich, which came out to just under $9 with tax.  We paid at the counter, and took our numbered placard to the outdoor seating area. Within 10 minutes, our food was whisked to our table by the waiter. One bite of my toasted, cheesey, melty, vegetarian sandwich and I was hooked. You could taste how fresh the ingredients were. You know this is a True Italian deli by the obvious care they put into feeding people.  The experience of dining al fresco was somewhat marred by the old guys smoking cigars at the next table. The breeze whipped the smoke right into our faces. Otherwise - buonissimo!",

Cashier was was very friendly and the service was fast.   I would probably give this sub a 4/5. It was a delicious sub but I've had better. The bread was really good and it wasn't messy like other subs that I've had that are just prone to falling apart.   I just really love that there's a freaking deli attached to this restaurant!

Ordered a bottle of wine, two soups and one main course, the bill was over $100 but greed took over and when I reviewed the e-mail receipt I saw they added a $2.00 split charge PER PERSON. Talk about going overboard. I guess if we had just asked for an extra plate there wouldn't be a split charge, but if they had to provide customer service then they need to charge for it. And, the bad thing also is that we were never advised. Greed does many things......including telling us not to return because their biggest attribute is GREED!",

They comped us a dessert which helped. Definitely an older crowd and not to kid friendly.",

    "text": "Some reviewers may not appreciate that good food is served in 'reasonable' quantities in classy restaurants and in Italy.  Apparently, some expect a trough-full of food!  This is as authentic as can be and the quality of the food is outstanding and the quantity appropriate!  Also, homemade pasta (and lasagne) have a different consistency than store-bought stuff; it's a mark of quality!  So, the lasagne may have a different consistency than what one may find in other so called Italian restaurants.  Siena's are very good.  The tiramisu is absolutely outstanding!!  The deli is a TREAT!  I never get tired of this place.  So, if a negative review is about the service, well, at times they are very, very busy (normally a very good sign about the quality of the restaurant!)  If the review is about the quality of the food, ignore it!  Obviously, the author doesn't know what good Italian fare really is!",

The pasta was cooked properly and the sauce was tasty and was served at the right temperature.   Live music was playing in the bar and we could here it in the dining area. Good thing it was jazz!

Had friends in from out of town on Thursday night who wanted Italian and I said I knew just the place. The menu was extensive, it was a beautiful night and they had the windows to the outdoor patio wide open - a beautiful setting. Had our appetizers - small salad and a couple of Capreses with a Super Tuscan and everything was fine.  Then things went south. One person ordered salmon well done. When the entrees came out, the salmon was missing. The waiter said that he didn't like the look of the salmon (presumably he meant undercooked) so he sent it back to the chef. Guess how long it took to get that salmon? The other three people had finished their entrees before the  salmon finally arrived. The restaurant was not busy and the delay was ridiculous. More about how the restaurant responded in a moment. Two of us had pasta - one with clams, one with a variety of seafood. Both of us thought that the pasta was mediocre - probably from a box. Disappointing but stuff happens. Now back to the salmon fiasco. The waiter apologized for the delay. He brought our table a dessert plate with 4 selections. Very nice we thought! The delay in bringing the salmon entree was bad but we thought that the restaurant recovered nicely with a free dessert. Until we saw the dessert on our bill. They tried to charge us. Was it an accident or they knew that we'd had several bottles of wine and tried to trick us into paying? Bottom line the food was nothing special and the service was a problem.  I really really wanted to like this place. I love Italian food. This isn't the place for me.",

    "text": "Went this evening for dinner with my boyfriend, our 5 year old daughter, and a friend. We checked out the deli first before dinner. It reminded me of my favorite deli back home with all the fresh meats, cheeses, pastas, and desserts. AH-MAZING!  We then headed into the restaurant and were seated right away. Our server was professional, friendly, and attentive (I think her name was Gloria). Food was awesome! We ordered calamari, a small Caesar salad, rigatoni bolognese, fettucine alfredo, a cheese pizza for our daughter, and some crazy pasta with scallops, lobster, and shrimp. Everything tasted fresh with the right amount of seasoning, and it was all hot! We were expecting to pay around $13 for the pizza as that was the price listed on the menu, but were very surprised to see our server only charged $5 for a kids pizza. Thanks!  We then went to the deli and ordered desserts to take home. We just finished dessert and everything was (surprise) delicious!  Everything was fantastic and we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "We went there on Friday night.. The restaurant was pretty empty around 9 pm.. They had live music gong and a few people were dancing near the bar,, the restaurant is a great neighborhood spot just minutes from boca park and red rock casino..  We ordered the vegan healthy pasta. I must say the pasta was absolutely fabulous,, we had asked for extra vegetables. The restaurants charged $3 extra per plate for the extra veges. I would have thought it would have been prudent for the waiter to let us know of the extra charge but this was not the case.. Also, since they had to open a brand new pasta box for the whole wheat penne, they asked if we want to take the remaining pasta home at a charge of $3.. We ended up paying about $20 per pasta plate.. Granted the pasta was really well done, I am not sure if $20 per pasta plate for a neighborhood restaurant is worth it..  The service was good.. Our waiter was extremely friendly..  While we may go back to the restaurant sometime in the distant future, I think there are a lot of other neighborhood restaurants serving similar or better Italian   food at a more reasonable price point,..",

My wife went with the fresh mozzarella sandwich caprese style and we got a slice of cheese to split.    All of the stuff was great.

    "text": "This place makes me sad.  For so many reasons.  I so wanted it to be good.  I'd so enjoyed the food over the years at Siena's (now closed) location near UNLV.  Walk in, it's pretty, it's dark, obviously what someone's been dreaming of for years.  The menu is pretty large, but it's one of those menus where you look at it, and there's nothing that jumps out at you.  OK, maybe that's just my taste...    A salad was so drenched in dressing I felt sorry for the spinach (and it should've been called a 'walnut salad' not a spinach salad since it was chock-full of walnuts, but not much spinach...weird...)  A pizza was solid (it's always been one of their strengths,) and pretty good value...easily big enough for 2 people (or 1 person's dinner AND lunch the next day.)    I took a peek into the deli next door and it was the familiar Siena fare, although it seemed pricier than the original location (like I never remember paying $7.99 a pound for their hot sausage.)  Finally, our waiter just kinda seemed to be wandering around aimlessly a lot of the time.  As I've mentioned before, I hate places where runners and bus staff have to pick up the slack all the time for less-than-competent waitstaff, and that was definitely the case here, at least with our waiter.  The slack was picked up really well by a really efficient bus person...but shouldn't be that way.",

    "text": "This is the type of find that YELP was invented for.  The type of place you can't wait to review once you get back from your vacation.  The type of Italian restaurant that's worth a 20 or so minute drive off the strip to enjoy the next time I'm in town.  Yes, it's WORTH that inconvenience, providing you already have a car.  I grew up Italian and so it's one of the few foods I'm an expert on.  When you know a cuisine and visit a Italian restaurant, you can -- if you desire -- order the deal breaker dishes.  The men from the boys dishes, if you will.  When they hit the table, you'll know if you've found a gem.  I didn't mean to do this with Siena.  It just sorta happened by accident.    My partner ordered a sun dried tomato angel hair pasta because she is vegetarian.  Believe it or not, there are two deal breakers there.  One, can Siena serve a vegetarian dish that a meat eater will not only sample but possibly order in the future.  Answer:  yes.  It was delicious without being over buttered, cheesed, or whatever.  Clean but crisp flavors, and yet with warmer undertones like a perfect cologne.  Two, angel hair pasta isn't worth ordering because most restaurants overcook it into a baseball of stringy goo.   Or they cook it okay, but it continues cooking on the dishes and dies before you finish it.  Nope.  Siena nailed this dish.  I ordered a chicken marsala.  Now this dish is relatively easy to prepare.  Even bad marsala is still good marsala.   But excellent marsala leaves the chicken terribly juicy and tasty, and this dish didn't disappoint.  The men from the boys situation was --  -- the side dish.  Firstly, Siena allowed me to substitute my mashed potatoes for pesto gnocchi.  I had to pay two additional dollars but it still only came out to something like $18.  On the strip this same meal would have been $28 and no substitutions thank you.  Secondly, Gnocchi comes two ways:  frozen factory (garbage) or handmade on the premises (heaven).  It's super easy to tell the difference, and this gnocchi was homemade.  You won't make this dish right at home, and so Siena gives you the chance to visit Italian heaven.  Do it.  If you have two couples, order as an appetizer to split.  With a salad.  But testing this restaurant wasn't over yet.  My partner ordered ricotta cheesecake.  Another item that's usually not worth ordering these days.  For anyone who doesn't know this:  the cheesecake at The Cheesecake Factory is lame and unacceptable.  Siena's cheesecake was not only the real McCoy, but had almondine and liqueur touches which closed the deal.  Siena is the best Italian food Restaurant I've had so far in Vegas.  It should replace the Onda in the Mirage.  It's not as classy and innovative as Olive's in Bellagio, but Siena simply serves better Italian food while not being too classic and boring... for a third of the price.  (You read that right.)  My favorite strip Italian (so far) is Rao's in Caesars, but Rao's has a hit or miss menu.  And they stopped serving real gnocchi a year or so ago to maximize profits.  Corporate, corporate, corporate.  (In my first draft of this review, I neglected to mention how solid the service was from Justin.  A week has passed since he served us and I still remember his name.  That doesn't happen often for me.)  But since I'm a born critic, I've got to say something bad about Siena.  Okay --  1.  The location blows unless you're a local.   I'm talking about the location being off strip, not the building itself.  But speaking of which --  2. -- the interior is nice (reminds me of a HOUSTONS), but the exterior is bland suburban stripmall tan stucco YUCCO.  The good news there is that the remainder of suburban Vegas is identically wretched and so they don't stand out in that way.  However --  3.  -- the restaurant's name and logo are too long and hard to remember.  THIS CAN KILL A PLACE.  How can you recommend something if you can't remember what it's called.  SIENA is nice and neat.  They should even consider SIENA ON SAHARA, which tells strip visitors WHERE it is and infers there will be more locations.  If you want advice on how to make the sign better, hire the guy who did FIREFLY next door.  Siena's exterior look and signage screamed 'local mistake' and yet the interior and food scream \"You'll be back.\"  Give it a try, Yelpers.  And Siena owners -- open a second location as close to the strip as possible.  Inside a property if you can manage it.",

    "text": "It has been a while since I've eaten at the Siena Trattoria and since our air conditioner is still out we decided to have dinner out. We started with what they call their \"buongustaio\". It's essentially a meat tray with a few small chunks of cheese, several olives (like 4 or 5) and a small dollop of roasted red peppers. I admit to enjoying the dish more than my wife did but I love prosciutto and theirs was well sliced (critical) and very tasty. It's a lot for two people to eat as an appetizer so we saved half to take home. For dinner my wife had a chicken Caesar salad which she really liked. She enjoyed the taste and the portion size (adequate but not huge). I had lasagna (being 100% Italian and all) and really enjoyed it. The portion size was good, the sauce delicious and the consistency just right. Sometimes lasagna can fall apart or be like it's made in a mold but not the lasagna served at Siena Trattoria. It was great. The service was excellent throughout. I'm sure we won't be waiting this long again between visits.",

At 8:15 we went to ask about our table and was told they are getting it ready. Note: There were quite a few open tables. Finally at 8:30 we were escorted to our table where we waited another 10 minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us. By that time we were starving and ordered an appetizer along with our meal. We asked for some bread and was told it was on it's way. We got the bread after our appetizer. After all that our food arrives from the set Valentines menu. We had linguine & clams  and the  spicy sausage ragout.  Both were bland. After paying over $100 for our meal we decided we wouldn't be back. Then to top it off I left my hat in the booth and realized it when I got home. I called the restaurant right away and asked the person on the phone if he could please see if it was there. He said they were to busy and would call me if they found it. When we left at 10:15 the restaurant was 1/2 full. I guess that's busy to them. Of course no one called and when I called the next day they said they knew nothing about it.",

My children are 12, 9, and 9, tapenade not a big favorite with the under 13 crowd, so we asked for some butter.  Didn't come.  We asked a second time for the butter and some more bread as my children were ravenous and had finished the first basket.  The butter came, but not the bread.  My wife is Italian, my children have been eating pasta their whole lives.They like the sauce on the side.  We ordered the sauce on the side, all three orders came with sauce.  My kids were troopers, they gave it a shot, it as not to their liking.  When we called it to our server's attention, she brought just one order without sauce, as if she did not understand that all my children were unhappy.  I ordered Chicken Parmigian which was not on the menu (the chicken was pretty good).  It came with pasta, I asked for broccoli instead of the pasta.  It came with the pasta and broccoli,  and a blond hair in the broccoli.  And then I was charged $5.50 for the broccoli.  The food was mediocre at best.  The service was horrible.    we are locals and would never go back.  This is my first Yelp review...it was such a bad experience it motivated me to sign up and write this.",

We each got something different off the menu and we all tasted each others meals... they each were a different type of sauce and pasta and made your taste buds explode with flavor that was just divine and made you want more.

    "text": "I was reluctant to give 5 stars to this wonderful deli... not because they didn't deserve it, but because I didn't want my first two reviews to be a 1 star and a 5 star. It looks like I am one extreme or the other -- but I was so impressed with this authentic Italian deli that 5 stars it is. Here's my story: I was hopping from one yard sale to the next with a friend when she wanted to take me to lunch. She asked if I had ever been to Sienna Deli, and I said that I never even heard of it. It was decided that I had to try their Italian Combo sandwich. Not quite a restaurant, this is more of an Italian Market than anything else. The deli counters are stocked full of meats and cheeses and more varieties of olives than I knew existed. There are rows of shelves stocked with grocery items -- presumably all imported directly from Italy. Sienna also features a dining area inside and an additional outside patio for diners. We ordered our sandwiches at the counter (Italian Combos) and were given a number card to take to our table. The food is delivered by a waiter; thus it is not fast food in my opinion. The sandwich was warm from the oven with flavorful fresh bread that was toasted to a crisp crunch! Generously layered with ham, salami and cheeses I consider this to be truly authentic cooking. On the table were olive oil, balsamic vinegar (my favorite) and assorted condiments to suit anyone's taste. The food was great... excellent even! I would recommend stopping in for lunch when you are in the neighborhood, as you will not be disappointed. As for the shelves stocked with Italian groceries, that is another story. I find it difficult to pay $3.79 for a can of tomatoes, especially when the exact same item is available at the 99 cent only store. Though the grocery prices were close to four times the available price I decided I was reviewing the food, thus the five star rating. My final thought is this: If you are planning on sitting out on the patio for lunch you might want to reconsider. It looks like it has been a long time since the tables and chairs were hosed down. Eat inside.",

    "text": "This has been my favorite Italian deli in Las Vegas since I have lived here.  The recent transition in ownership in the past few years had made it even better.  The quality of the food is still excellent, but they have really cleaned the place up and made it more enjoyable to stay and eat in a clean environment.  Favorites include the Siena sandwich (chicken, spinach sauteed in garlic and oil, provolone), the Italian or Sicilian sandwich, their pizza, and their antipasto - all of it is excellent.  Desserts are also great too - cannoli, gelato, etc...  Even had the pleasure of taking my family on our last visit and they had a lively older gentleman there who was playing the accordian and telling some great stories.  Well worth a visit, and a great variety of deli options here.",

    "text": "Saturday we went to the bar for a few beers plus fried calamari and crab cakes. The bar was empty except for a small group of regulars. The bartender ignored us for a while. He finally took our order. Got our beers. It took forever to get his attention so we could order our food. It finally came. I again had to get his attention to ask for a basket of bread. Then the same thing to get some butter. Then had to flag him down to get another beer for each of us. My husband finished his 2nd beer. The bartender took away the empty bottle, but never asked if he wanted another. We had to flag him down again get another beer. He finally came back and took our empty plates. He then immediately gave us our bill! He never even asked if I wanted another beer! The vibe of the place was very strange. The bartender had a dead pan expression that never changed. He stayed at the far end of the bar the whole time. Only checked on the regulars once in a whole to see if anyone wanted another drink. During our stay, a man walked up to the bar and was furious because he was at a table in the bar area with friends, but even though they saw them there, no one came over to wait on them. The service was unfriendly and awful. The food was not good at all. We will not be back.",

We sat in the bar area and had to wait long time for anybody to come to the table and even longer for the waiter, who was also attending the bar,  to come back, despite very few people in the restaurant that evening.  Food was standard Italian-nothing interested or particularly tasty. Ambience was Ok, again standard restaurant. Prices high for the quality of the food and even higher for the quality of the service. Not good value. There are many better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas.",

Where do I begin with this place!!! You can get lunch to go, the most amazing pizza squares or sammies, while your there pick up frozen tortellini and sauce and real Parmesan cheese for dinner. Not to mention fresh baked Italian bread every day. I cannot say enough how amazing this place is. Stop in on yore way home, take eastern instead of the freeway, and pick dinner up at the GEM of a place. I love going in and picking up real pasta and tomatoes from Italy, and getting a scoop of gelato and stuff for dinner. I always find something fantastic on the shelves that I must have and will always go back for a taste of real Italy and a friendly family counter experience!!! GO TO SIENNA!!!!!!",

Sadly the Albertsons next door closed making it a special trip when I go, but worth it when I do. Excellent food , dessert, meats and cheeses. I love to get the garlic knots, prob the best thing ever. Trying to snag a man but can't cook ladies? Make a quick swing in and grab a few \"homecooked\" items and next thing you know yer pickin out curtains!",

On our first visit, I ordered the shrimp scampi and my husband got a salmon sandwich. Both orders were delicious. And that's why we came back again. On our second visit, we ordered shrimp scampi (again for me!) and lasagna. We were again left smiling with the food. On our third visit, my husband ordered the eggplant parmesan and a lobster ravioli. The eggplant parmesan was good and we love the lobster ravioli. Their bread pudding is delicious. It's a nice local italian place. We will definitely come back. And btw, service is good as well.",

Would definitely go back and recommend it for anyone looking for a GREAT italian meal!",
