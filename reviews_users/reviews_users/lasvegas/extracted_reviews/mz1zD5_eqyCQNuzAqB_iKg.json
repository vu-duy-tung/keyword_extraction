The pozole was very good, but it is a tad spicy. No one makes fideo like my mom. Pancho's was okay, I don't see myself ordering it again. Their horchata is the best I've had, not too sweet, just perfect.",

    "text": "This place - which is DIFFERENT from Panchos Tacos on Pecos - is definitely in the top 3 vegan restaurants in Vegas.  Everything is fresh and prepared to order so guacamole here is the best in town because it hasn't been sitting around.  Battered avocado is a welcome alternative to faux vegan meats. And if you want vegan meat you can get tofu, which is the healthiest vegan meat there is because it is a lot less processed than soy meats.  I like that they have some unique vegan items such as fideo soup and I especially like that I can add soup to my meal for a couple dollars. It sucks to go to a place like The Modern Vegan and have to pay $10 if you want a soup with your meal.  To round it out - servers are very patient and attentive and the restaurant is classy and clean.  One negative I've found: nachos and enchiladas have very little cheese on them and the cheese is not melted. These dishes are still good, but if you are looking for something cheezy - look elsewhere!  BEWARE Don't confuse this place Panchos Kitchen with Panchos Tacos on the east side of town!!",

We learned based of other Yelp reviews there was a vegan option! I got the crunchy taco plate and the almond milk Horchata. It was nice and tasty. Nothing heavy. The sauce was nice and light. I especially love their green salsa! My son got the Huevos Rqncheros which was nicely done compared to others I had it the past. The salsa / pico de gallo made it so yum!   Service was really nice. They were very accommodating. The new owner told me they're going to have a bigger Vegan menu with Cuban inspired dishes! Exciting! I'll definitely be back!",

We learned that calling ahead is a lot easier because it takes 15-20 minutes for them to cook your order sometimes, which is fine with us since they make everything fresh! And you can definitely taste the freshness in all of their food, we've eaten here over 10 times now and it never disappoints. My boyfriend usually goes for the chicken tacos or the carne asada burrito and I usually go for the vegan tacos or vegan nachos. My fav tacos are the crispy avocado and potato taco. I also had their vegan tamale for the first time recently and all I can say is WOW. It's a must try (even my boyfriend loved it). I'm not a big fan of pinto beans (even though theirs are actually very good) so I sub them with the black beans and they are literally the best I've ever had! Also, the ladies behind the counter are so sweet every time we get our order and give the place such a great atmosphere!",

I don't remember what I had ordered but it was Vegan. Blah Blah Blah. Is this the best Vegan food in Las Vegas? YES IT IS. Why? Because in Mexico people don't eat what we think of Mexican food here. People in Mexico actually eat what we call vegan all the time and no one is watching over their shoulders keeping tabs on when they ate meat or dairy. Mexican food in Mexico just happens to be vegan a lot of the times. And this little place in Las Vegas does just that. Real authentic Mexican food that just happens to be Vegan (with the exception of the Vegan sour cream but you can do without just fine.) So that's my review. If you went there and didn't like it then you just didn't get it. The way you probably didn't get that Jackson Pollock at the Modern. Your loss.",

The menu had a couple of my favorite authentic items ( i.e posole and blue corn ) I thought I'd try both. They don't have the blue corn so I just went with the posole hoping it would be as good as moms. Well unfortunately it wasn't, not even close. It was extremely bland and didn't come with the traditional garnish. I know that sounds petty but without the cabbage, onion cilantro and radish posole is incomplete! Kinda like pancakes with syrup. Bean and cheese burrito was ok and the gordita was ok as well. Now..... Let's talk about how long the food takes to be prepared. Mind you this is a Roberto type of taco shop! It took them 45mins! I'm ok with waiting on good food at a normal restaurant but this is a taqueria! And they forgot my bean and cheese burrito. I called and was told she forgot and would refund me my money on the burrito and being I stay right around the corner I went back for my burrito but wasn't refunded my money instead was given a complimentary side of chips and rice pudding. Ok no biggie I thought as I'd like to give this place a second shot. So we came back here 5 days later to give it another chance at redemption and sad to say they couldn't deliver  This time I ordered 3 asada tacos thinking they cant mess this up. My wife order the green chicken enchiladas and again my boys order bean and cheese burritos I tried to order the blue corn again and still they had no blue corn. The tacos failed miserably! The burrito came with black beans this time instead of pinto but was slightly better this time. The enchiladas were actually really good! But again almost 1 hour for food coming from a taqueria. Let me stress to you that the first time I was the only customer they had. The 2nd time there was 1 lady that ordered ahead of me. I might come back for the enchiladas alone! I suggest you look at the menu online and order 30 to 40 mins before arriving and please do not attempt this place on your lunch break unless your the boss or the boss really likes you and doesn't mind you taking well over 1 hour breaks. P.S don't bother asking for the blue corn as I think it's on the menu for show",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out after finding it on yelp. We were really happy to find an authentic Mexican restaurant that offered a vegan menu. Yay! It's a small restaurant in a nice area. It's also family owned. Elena was very sweet and had great customer service.  Our food didn't take long at all but they gave us chips and salsa while we waited. We ordered a lot because everything looked so good lol. The beer battered avocado tacos, potato tacos, and mushroom tacos are all a must have! We also got the vegan enchiladas, nachos, and a tamale. I have never tried a vegan tamale before and it was so good! I honestly really liked everything we ordered. Everything had great flavor! Not too expensive either. Elena even told us they plan on expanding their vegan menu soon. We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone! Can't wait to go back (:",

    "text": "Delicious food. Above and beyond service. We can't say enough about this place.  Both regular and allergy menus are bomb.  The vegan gluten free menu is delicious.  They are very conscientious about cross contamination of wheat and dairy which is great for freaks like me. I had the veggie bowl.  What ever is in the mock sour cream, it's very realistic. Lots of veggies and delicious sauces.   My little one had a tummy ache when she arrived and they made her some white rice.  Not on the menu.  They made it special for her.  When she was feeling better she pounded a quesadilla.  Loved it.  My husband had the chicken tacos.  Again, lots of fresh veggies and fresh chicken.   The food was yummy and filling.  Large portions of healthy food kept us going strong all day.   It will take a little longer than your average fast food Mex to get your food but you won't be disappointed.   Carnivores and herbivores alike will love this place.  Enjoy!",

They should also provide a salsa bar and chips to munch on while the food is prepared. I didn't see any chunky salsa, just the traditional red and green. The drinks were not given to us when we ordered, but when the food was ready. The staff was friendly. The food was good and reasonably priced. The place was clean. I'm not sure if there are refills on drinks. Next time, I am going to call the order in, and then go pick it up.",

    "text": "I've been a loyal customer since their Fort Apache location. When that location closed, I was devastated. Although another guy took over the restaurant under a different name (Paiz) and a similar menu, it was not the same. I've been patiently waiting to find out what Elena and her family had in store for the future; so I was beyond ecstatic when I saw news of Pancho's opening on Facebook this morning. I immediately rushed over!  Wow! Pancho's always had the best vegan Mexican food in town, but now they have a great looking restaurant to go along with the food. The old place was very plain. This location is a LOT bigger and everything from the wall decor to the stringed lights makes for an ambiance that matches the cuisine perfectly.   Their vegan menu is also more extensive than before, and I intend on trying all of their new items with each visit. I can't speak about their non-vegan items because I have never tried them nor will I ever. All of their vegan food that I've tried thus far has been delicious! My favorites are the crunchy potato tacos, the vegan nachos, and anything with the cilantro lime mushrooms. Their vegan beverage selection is all made in house and yummy as well, from their horchata to their fruit juices. They also have an alcohol license now. I look forward to trying their micheladas very soon.   The only way this place could be better than it already is is if they went 100% vegan, but I completely understand that as a business it's more profitable to be appealing to the general public. If you could not already tell, I am a huge foodie, and I can confidently say that this is my FAVORITE restaurant in Vegas. If I could give more stars, I would for this yummy vegan friendly restaurant that's run by a super sweet family!",

Reviews say the items are truly vegan but you can't find anything on their website or in the place about how they cook, ingredients used or animal friendly practices. Most restaurants that offer this type of food boast about their practices and why it's important to them. Makes me think this place is just trying to make a buck off the vegan community.

    "text": "I have hesitated writing a Yelp review for Pancho's because it's like writing a love letter to your crush. Like, how do you even start to convey how amazing they are or how much you adore them?   To start, the food is phenomenal. Their vegan menu is massive, and I like that the emphasis is on veggie based alternatives (and not just soy based mock meats---though they do offer tofu now). My favorites include the green pozole with all the trimmings, the mole enchiladas stuffed with succulent mushrooms, and the vegan PK omelet (which, don't tell, but they've let me order past noon on more than one occasion).   The staff here is so sweet and attentive. Some servers definitely move faster than others, but they are all very nice and try their best. Though if you get \"that one guy\" be prepared to give gentle reminders in a \"bless your heart\" kind of way.   The only itty bitty, teeny, weeny bit of criticism I have is that they don't give you heaps of chips with the salsas or guacamole (and I usually have to ASK for the initial courtesy serving of chips/salsa). Know how most places give a whole basket? They offer one small handful per person at the table. Like, I'm talking maybe 5 chips apiece. This always strikes me as weird because all the other portions are huge. I'm sure it's because they don't want them to go to waste, but those chips are bomb and I want more, dangit! I might have to settle by just ordering the nachos! :P   Seriously, I love this place. I have never taken anyone here who has not fallen in love with it too. This place has my heart!",

I asked for some more chips and salsa once we made it way through our first serving and our waiter told me that only the first serving is on the house. The rest costs extra. No thanks. I walked out of there having paid $18 for tacos a drink and a minimal tip. So, yeah, the food is fine, but there are better choices elsewhere that are much more affordable.",

Everything was so good, it was actually overwhelming, and I don't think we spoke the entire time we were inhaling it all.  It has also been years since I've had an elote! I used to flag down the elote man like every damn day growing up in Los Angeles, so I was in heaven!   Lastly, I asked for a bolillo bread roll by itself, as the menu lists it as a sandwich-type dish, and I expected the waitress to think I was a weirdo. But not only did she NOT think I was a weirdo, she totally validated my request and we both went on about how delicious they are with just a little bit of [vegan] butter and sugar with cinnamon. She happily brought some to my table. I love her. And her mother (who was in the back cooking up deliciousness) also commented on how good that sounded and that she wanted some too! I love her also.  Thank you Pancho's Kitchen for providing delicious vegan Mexican options!",

The flavor was delicious though. My nachos were really good. I liked the veggie mix. We also ordered dessert. I got the dessert nachos and my cousin got the churros. We both got ice cream with them. The chocolate ice cream is a must! All of this for only $48! Great buy, good atmosphere. We would definitely come back again.",

I have been searching for an authentic Vegan Mexican food restaurant for so so so long and who would have known I would stumble into one in Las Vegas! THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!! I had to go back for seconds before the drive back home. Definitely recommend their chillaquiles and mollete from their vegan menu.    I personally thought the prices were fairly priced because the food is very filling. Definitely worth every penny!!   Everyone who works there is extremely nice and accommodates to your every needs.   Can't wait to go back to their restaurant and try more of their dishes.   Please bring Pancho's Kitchen to Los Angeles. We need some vegan authentic Mexican food over here!! There's nothing like it in LA.",

I was happy to be alone but still feeling pretty sick. I asked the girl to bag it to go. When I got home, I sat down to eat and when I bit into the meat of the posole it was hard. Almost like they tried to warm it up in the microwave and the meat hardened. It was terrible! I called the number on Yelp and a woman answered and I told her what happened. She was mortified! She said this has never happened before. Within 20 minutes, she had someone deliver a fresh new batch of posole to my house! It was perfect, just like my abuela used to make it!!!

The newer location is closer to my house and I was so excited to finally make it over there yesterday. I ordered the potato taco dinner that comes with 3 tacos, beans and rice and a watermelon Fresca. I got it to go. So here's why I do not give them 5 stars. The drink and food were put into Styrofoam containers, which was a huge turn off for me.  The food was delicious as usual. I just couldn't get past the fact that the yummy food came in earth destroying, never biodegrades Styrofoam. I will eat there again but only if we sit down in the restaurant and I won't be able to take my leftovers home. Please, I beg of you Pancho s, please find more eco friendly to go containers. Thank you, in advance, for being good stewards of mother earth.",

Don't let any of that scare you away though, this place stands out where it matters most: the food.  Everything seems very fresh here, the corn and flour tortillas are all hand made and delicious.  They don't seem to advertise this, but they should because their tortillas are better than most tortilla factory restaurants I've been to. Fresh tortillas being the key to a great Mexican dish, it's no surprise that the food is quite exceptional. It's not the best I've had anywhere, but it's certainly the freshest and best tasting taqueria style food I've had in Las Vegas.   My only real gripe is the chips and salsa. The tortillas are good, but when fried, they make chips that are thick and kinda hard. The three salsas that were served tasted pretty bland. About half way through our meal we asked if there was a hotter salsa available and they brought us a really good molcajete style sauce that was spicy and full of flavor. I definitely can recommend this sauce, but you have to request it.  So far, I've tried the chicken chilaquiles, tacos, and burritos and all were great. Definitely will be coming back!",

I was intrigued by the beer battered avocado tacos and I'm so glad I ordered them. Delicious! How they create a crisp crunch just like a fish taco is genius. The side rice and beans were flavorful and the complimentary chips and salsa were also good. They offer a choice of mild or spicy salsa with the chips. Everything tasted fresh and house made. I'll certainly be back because I have to try the crunchy potato tacos and green enchiladas. The dining room has a nice atmosphere and I noticed that the staff take care to keep the tables clean. They don't just swipe crumbs on the floor, they actually clean the tables properly. See you folks again soon, I'm glad I have some meatless options that don't involve bread, pasta, tofu, or the eternal salad.",

Server was really nice and recommended the Chilaquiles for breakfast, it sounded really good but not was I was in the mood for but I let my indecisiveness take over and go for it. Got mushroom and beer battered avocado for $2 extra. It was really good but I think I just got too excited that it was vegan and didn't realize it was probably one of the unhealthiest options. I mostly wanted something not too heavy after my hike. The chips are fried (I also got chips n salsa since I didn't realize this) and avocado is fried. So it's basically a big plate of delicious fried food that I wish I wouldn't have gotten. With that being said it WAS good! Red and green sauce were both good, avocado dangerously amazing, and mushrooms were the only fresh touch. Can't wait to come back and try something else",

It's been almost 2 months since being plant based and the one thing I miss is Mexican food. They have a separate vegan kitchen so there is no cross contamination. The owner started as a vendor at farmers market and would watch friends of his guests not eat due to dietary restrictions and he wanted everyone to be able to enjoy a meal together so he created a full vegan menu. Their food is all non GMO and as close to all organic as he can get. Our waiter was Jocelyn (owner's daughter) she was so helpful and friendly. The restaurant and bathrooms were both so clean. Such a FANTASTIC restaurant. We will be back for sure.",

My avocado guacamole never came either. The tacos were good and the other dish was good as well. Nothing were memorable. The restaurant had 27 customer for 1 server and no busier.

But when I looked over there huge vegan menu I was limited to only soft tacos with vegetables or mushrooms. I couldn't even eat the chips because they are not gluten free. I couldn't order a side of potatoes because they use soy oil. I ordered a side of guacamole which was not fresh ( frozen) and the vegetable tacos. Vegetables had no flavor but the rice was delicious. If I would come back it would be only for the rice.  Friendly service, food was fast, decor was beautiful and plenty of seating. I was very disappointed. They shouldn't advertise plenty of soy free options when they fry practically everything in soy oil. Also my bill came out to $19.49 for two tacos a glass of OJ and small 1 oz of guacamole. Would never come back. Way over priced.",

Had a bit of a hangover and I was craving Mexican food. Quickly searched for a place and we decided on Panchos kitchen.  As we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcoming by the waitress. She informed us we may take a seat wherever we'd like. This is what really got my attention.. she asked if we wanted a regular menu, vegan menu or both? I was amazed that a Mexican restaurant has such an option! On a totally separate menu. Very cool! Big plus for the vegan customers. We opted for regular.  She took our orders and brought out the chips and salsa complementary.  I ordered posole with a pineapple drink, mom got the asada sopes.  Posole - flavorful and the meat was so tender! I did not have to ask for anything on the side as the waitress brought it all. A side of all the needed ingredients and the posole comes with a side of tortillas or crunchy potato tacos. So delicious!   My mothers sopes came nicely plated, the tortilla is nice and crunchy not too doughy! each sope was overly stuffed!  The waitress checked on us throughout the whole meal. She asked how the food was and if anything else was needed. We felt very comfortable dining here and I'm really glad we chose this place. I'd definitely come back the next time I'm in Las Vegas.",

I came here a while back and as of what I remembered they had a happy hour menu for drinks, recently when I came a day ago they didn't have that menu anymore. Overall they have great food choices ! Last time I remember I ordered the vegan pozole, it was a green pozole, the other day when I came I ordered the regular non-vegan pozole. I would highly recommend both ! I liked the vegan option way better than the non-vegan pozole though! Our server was super friendly as well, but we never got her name.",

So i did my LV yelp research and was super ecstatic to find there were at least 6 legit bombass lookin vegan restaurants to try out! Hit this place up because the pics made the food look dee-lish. I came with my non-vegan friend and we both looooved it.  We had the \"carne asada fries and the burrito with tofu\".  Huge portions for both, like HUGE. Everything was flavorful.  The burrito with all the fillings and spices made the tofu just bomb! The fries were mixed with different veggies beans, spices, and everything tasted like heaven.  We both finished everything and had no regrets for our rock solid tummies! I recommend this place fosho, we'll be going back to try literally everything on the menu!!! Yaaaas :)",

    "text": "\"Opportunities are like sunrises. If you wait too long, you miss them.\" - William Arthur Ward  Vegan tacos!!! I don't ever look for vegan tacos on a menu, but when in Rome you have to right? I was hanging out with one of my favorite teenagers one afternoon when Mexican food was requested. We were close to Pancho's Kitchen and stopped in.  She felt like a Carne Asada Burrito, so I ventured back a few years to a time when I put down a lot more Carne Asada burritos than otoro and shared a burrito with her so that we could both have a few of the famous tacos that Pancho's is serving up. The burrito was fine...you can order it here if that's your preference and you probably won't be disappointing, but the tacos...the tacos stole the show! Since it was a Tuesday and all, we opted to try the Vegan Potato Taco, Vegan Avacado Taco, Vegan Mushroom Taco, and (kicking the vegan pattern) a Shrimp Taco. The Vegan tacos were bomb! The avocado is beer battered but, while tasty, may have been my least favorite since it's a little heavy from being fried. The Mushroom comes full of lime-cilantro flavors and our favorite was the potato--simple and perfectly savory.  I wouldn't hesitate to stop back in...and the next time I'm looking for vegan tacos, I'll know exactly where to go!",

That said, I'm thrilled this place is back! Their new location is super convenient, and being able to walk to a vegan restaurant from my house rocks. The interior is totally transformed from the previous deli spot, and food and service have improved too!  VEGAN MENU: Good variety, breakfast served all day plus entrees. Enchiladas are solid, but the taco sampler plate is what I come back for (the cilantro-lime mushrooms are awesome). Molletes make a great breakfast dish. I like how they use quality non-dairy sour cream and cheese products and not Daiya. I'm looking forward to trying their nachos! If you're inching into vegan cuisine, try the potato tacos, they're a crowd-pleaser.  REGULAR MENU: Their best work is in the vegan items, but they also offer regular Mexican food so as not to limit their patrons. Their carne asada is really good, and I recommend their burritos, fideo, and enchiladas. Breakfast menu looks great, will be trying those dishes soon.   PRICING: Vegan menu is priced appropriately for a niche product with a limited target audience. People will come here for their great specialty vegan food. $13 for a taco sampler with sides is fair, and the $10 burrito packed with your choice of vegan fillings isn't unreasonable. Non-vegan menu prices are on the high side (think $12 wet burrito, $8 for chips and salsa?!), and need to come down a buck or two per item to be reasonable for the area. This isn't downtown Summerlin.   I really like the food here and I'm grateful to have a nearby vegan option when I'm too lazy to try to stick to it. I'm hoping they do well in this location!",

I didn't know there could be so many variations of vegan food! It's so great being able to still have that same flavor, but just with healthier alternatives. This location just opened up last month. The interior of the restaurant is designed and decorated so nicely. It has that vibe as if I'm going to my best friend's mom's house for some tasty authentic mexican food - very homey and welcoming.  The hostess/waitress I had was Lily and she was extremely kind and helpful. She checked up on my boyfriend and I many times to make sure that we were doing okay.   I like that they give you an appetizer of chips and salsa, on the house. I ordered a vegan burrito with lime-cilantro mushroom and my boyfriend ordered from the regular menu - a burrito with al pastor meat. Yes, they are a little bit pricey, especially on the regular menu. A burrito with a side of chips is $10. But at the end of the meal, I still felt very full and content.",

The price was fair I don't know why some people are complaining about it really. It's in good portions and made when you order. The staff were nice and overall good experience. I will definitely be coming back and ordering more.",

You can see the love & passion she (the owner) puts into preparing your food. And she's very sweet & nice as is her staff.

My food was atrocious and almost inedible. I ordered their beef tacos and what I got was beef jerky in almost burnt shells. My fiance's burrito was dry and had no flavor.  The best thing we had was the chips and salsa which unfortunately was lacking in quantity.  Won't be returning :(",

Got barely enough chips and salsa to snack on and yeah, only the first basket is complimentary. In addition, tried to order different types of tacos for the 3 taco combo meal and was told there is a $2 charge to mix and match. Really!? Come on bro, stop nickel and diming people. Your taco combo is $12.50 and comes with 3 tacos. Now to give credit where credit is due, the food is good but with so many Mexican restaurants in the valley to choose from I would take a pass at Pancho's Kitchen. Head over to Bomb Tacos, Me Gusta Tacos, Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo and you will get a much better meal without hurting your wallet.",

We ordered the elote but we're told that it was unavailable however, they could serve it shaven. Ok, No problem except when it arrived at the table it was clearly canned corn. They didn't even try to hide it by draining the water. SMH.  we send it back and order the guacamole. Definitely was made fresh. Not bad but a little unique with a strong black pepper flavor. Our main dish arrived shortly after. We ordered the chicken quesadilla but substituted the flour for corn tortilla. The quesadills came out just as we expected except for the menu listed one of the sides as lettuce however it was clearly cabbage . The cabbage was a nice, fresh surprise, I suppose. Won't be back but glad I finally stopped in to free my mind of curiosity about this place. On to the next one...",

    "text": "Vegan Mexican food?! Blasphemy! My co-worker convinced me to try this place out. Not too busy during the lunch hour. We ordered 2 lettuce wrap tacos - lime/cilantro mushroom and poblano-zucchini, veggie asada fries with added beer battered avocados, and veggie stir fry. I also ordered a pineapple agua fresca.   Firstly, everything was seasoned well and had tons of flavor. The mushroom taco was \"meaty\" and had a nice spice. The zucchini was cooked al dente, which is exactly how I like it. The sauces on both tacos were mild but still packed a little punch. The asada fries were packed full of veggies and vegan cheese. Again, veggies were cooked just right. The beer battered avocado was a little heavy, not something I'd order again. My co-worker said her stir fry was pretty good and the sauce was flavorful. The agua fresca was so refreshing and you can really tell it's fresh.   The menu says everything is cooked fresh to order so be ready to wait just a little longer to get your order. I wasn't too keen on vegan Mexican but I was impressed with this place. I'm sure I'll be back to try other items on the menu.",

You can go to a low key taco shop and enjoy better tasting food for much less. My guess is the high rating must've been for their vegan menu, from vegan customers. Don't know, don't care. I just was appalled at the high prices for food that didn't even stand out to me, tbh. The only good thing I enjoyed was the horchata, which wasn't refillable. Oh well.",

My go to item are the potato tacos. Three deep fried corn tortillas stuffed with flavorful potatoes. It comes with refried beans which are amazing and fluffy yellow rice.  The wet burritos are huge and filled to the max. I had the pastor that was melt in your mouth tender! The red sauce just put it over the top. The salsa and chips are great and pico on point. All of their aguas frescas are really good too, they actually have chunks of fruit in them- Yum! Reasonably priced for great home made food!",

The food came out pretty fast which was a plus since we only scheduled one hour for this meeting. There wasn't that many people at 1:30pm, so it was quiet for us to talk.   We all wanted meat so none of us tried the vegan menu. They looked pretty delicious on the pictures. I will come back and try them later. From the regular menu, the server recommended enchiladas and creamy poblano chicken. I went with the chicken enchiladas. One of my colleague got the shrimp enchiladas and queso with chips and salsa and the other one got the carne asada nachos. Both of us who got the enchiladas were satisfied with our entrees. Not my coworker who got the carne asada nachos. She only had few chips.    Chicken enchiladas (4/5): I enjoyed my dish. The flavor was great. However, the chicken was a bit dry.   Carne asada nachos (2:5): I tried a few. I didn't like the carne asada. It has a lot of fatty chewy beef. Not enough cheese either.   Overall, I will return again due to the convenience factor, good services, and decent food.",

I couldn't even bite into it because it was so hard and over cooked and try to cut in grains and it was just smooshed ( almost like mash potatoes consistency ) .   Time for my menudo -  don't know if meat was undercooked because it was a Saturday and usually places only serve menudo on Sunday's but menu said sat and Sunday's  I know menudo es chewy already but this was like bitting into raw cow stomach literally , disgusting    We got out conplementary chips and salsa for like 7 people and that complimentary was like for 2 person (the portion was so small ) we asked for more since we were all paying separate  and said we had to pay for extra , we did  then the salads were just old lettuce  - the only good thing was the potatoe tacos .  I will definitely not come back and was really surprised by such good reviews , maybe was just the cook ",

I feel like she went above and beyond to serves us. Her name is Lilly make sure you ask for her.   We decided to order from the vegan menu ( they also have a regular menu) I ordered the vegan chilaquiles and OMG they were very delicious the sauce was perfect! It came with beans and they were also very good by the time I finished my plate I was very full but I couldn't stop eating that's how good everything was lol. My husband ordered the huevos rancheros also from the vegan menu they also came with beans. He said everything was very good we both left very satisfied.   I will definitely be back!

    "text": "I came here for dinner on 4/13/16 with my boyfriend because of the amazing reviews from the vegan community. We saw them at Vegas VegFest but I got so drenched during the hail/torrential rain bit that we had to leave early thus not sampling Pancho's. While not solely vegan, Pancho's is extremely vegan friendly and even has a separate vegan menu!  I have to say I was a little confused when we arrived because it was a lot smaller and less charming than I thought. Many other Yelpers have accidentally posted pictures intended for the Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin. This is a completely different restaurant. I reported those pictures and hopefully they will be taken down as it's quite misleading. This restaurant is really small and probably best for takeout though there's plenty of tables to dine in, which is what we did for our first time.  I ordered the vegan Tamal ($8.50) which is a tamale wrapped in swiss chard and my boyfriend ordered the vegan Breakfast Burrito ($9) without the tofu scramble that's usually included in the burrito (they were out). I picked the Tamal because it was the only gluten free vegan item and I have a sensitivity which can make me sick if I have too much. However, it seems they are pretty accommodating and can make other dishes gluten free. The man and the woman that were working when we were there were very nice people.  We sat down to wait and we were brought over some chips and salsa. Chips were yummy.. and both vegan and gluten free.. but there weren't many at all, maybe just a handful. Additionally, the salsa is in squirt bottles, which is handy when you receive your entree but kind of weird when you're eating your chips because you can't dip them. That salsa verde is delicious though! Our entrees came out moments later and we thoroughly enjoyed them. My boyfriend and I both agreed the Tamal kind of had a weird aftertaste which I attribute to the swiss chard which can sometimes be bitter. Don't get me wrong, this was one deliciously vegan tamale and I will be ordering it again! And you can't expect vegan food to taste the same as non-vegan food. This is a wonderful substitute! However, they were a little skimpy on the rice and beans as well (well honestly I eat a lot!) and I ended up ordering an additional side of rice ($1.50) to go with the second half of my tamale. I also squirted a bunch of salsa verde on the rice to give it some more flavor. My boyfriend demolished his burrito. His only complaint was that it was too starchy which he says would probably be fixed by adding the tofu scramble (hopefully they'll have it next time!). I tried one of the potatoes in his burrito and it was seasoned to perfection. We also tried their horchata which was pretty good.  I'll be back and I'm excited to try the rest of the vegan dishes. Maybe even tonight for dinner :) Thanks to Pancho's for including vegan and gluten free items on their menu!",

Our loaded nachos came with a mix of veggies and at first I figured it was going to be the basic fajita mix....wrong! There was asparagus, cauliflower, mixed heirloom carrots and other fresh veggies. We were very impressed! The enchiladas curbed my craving and will definitely be something I crave. The only thing that was surprising was the prices, It was much more expensive than what I was expecting. That was tad of a bummer to spend so much but the food was good. I recommend it to everyone! May not be a weekly thing for us cause of $$ but will definitely be back!",

Really! Try 'em for yourself!  The vegan tamale wrapped in greens is also amazing! It is the best I've ever had. Waiting for my own food to come, I took bites of the veg burrito from my generous significant other! I cannot wait to get my hands on the avocado tacos for next time... The nachos were good, too! Portions are decent, and I find myself with a plate licked clean every single time!  It's a hole-in-the-wall type of atmosphere, so don't come in here expecting a full-service restaurant. But the bathrooms are clean, and the employees are absolutely pleasant! When it comes to Mexican. Pancho's is the place to be!",

I ate it as I cost almost $20 bucks on Uber Eats. Then today. It was Nacho Daddy or Panchos.  Well for Mexican Nacho Daddy's Vegan Menu is incredible. But well I ordered that so many times. I thought I give Panchos a try again. Well I got the Potato Crunchy Tacos and a side of Fideo soup. The Tacos were ok. You get three. But why bother putting rice and beans if there are almost invisible. And the Fideo came in the tiniest tiniest cup. At best this was a sample. I'm so disappointed. It was mushy and odd flavor. So back to Nacho Daddy's. I'm still hungry so a Cup of Noodle is in order as I spent $20.00 on this.",

    "text": "I have been waiting Soooo long to write this review. First thing I have to say I I can't wait to go back. The architecture of this building is AMAZING. Please see my pics I took, you walk in through two sets of massive Spanish mission doors. There is beautiful mosaic tile every where, the immigration brick skillfully hides the structural support in the central \"Garden\" . I saw at least one fountain in the garden room and a tone of foliage! You apskot feel like your outside with the 9 giant skylights above. Also, people in the restaurant industry usually judge places by their bathrooms ( if you spend the money for a nice restroom, your probably looking a pretty solid operation everywhere else) these restrooms were equally as nice as the dining area however , why they didn't put dark wood water closet dividers that match the rest of the space , I do not know.   Now to the food! Great segue right? The food was excellent. I have been when waiting for a \"real\" Mexican food to open up on this side of town forever.  Beans and rice are always the first thing I try, these were great and everything was very hot and fresh. Their salsa is very similar to frank and fina's with healthy amount of onions and sweetness.  I had an order of Guac which was good but extremely over priced (13.95 for what couldn't have been more than 3.5 ounces) . If anyone from Panchos reads this listen now: Agave went out of business in 3 months, less than 1/2 mile away for trying to do the  same thing. Yes, your in Summerlin, yes red rock CC is near by, but the majority of your business will be retirees and families that live within 3 miles. Don't price yourself out of the market and give someone that beautiful building for pennies on the dollar.   Back the the food, I had a combination, beef taco and chili relleno. The taco was a less greasy version of Roberto's. Which is great! The real winner here was the Relleno. Easily the best relleno within 100 miles and the price for the entree plate was 14.95, totally within reason for that plate. Go have one.   Finally, Antonio was in training with Fernando and they were both excellent servers with warm smiles. I will be back frequently.",

When we get the check. Combo was 14.50??? I asked the waitress why she apologized and told us it was her fault that she didn't tell us the tacos all had to be one meat. It does not say the on the Menu. Tacos carnitas were way to salty. The asada tasted a bit burned and  the pastor was crunchy also. We still got charged 14.50 even when she pointed out it was her fault. Not going again.",

I ordered the green enchiladas (which you have 5 choices on the stuffing) and I couldn't resist I had to try the cauliflower wings.  They were both delicious and plated very nicely, the wings were great I chose medium (a little to hot for me my bad)  the enchilada (you get 3)  had a wonderful texture and lots of flavor with a side of beans and rice :)  I will go back again and again, you have to try it.",

Just imagine a Roberto Tacos, but instead of a chain restaurant it is a family owned business. I ordered a carne asada burrito which was delivered within five minutes. The food and flavors were very authentic and had a very good taste. They mixed the meat, rice and beans with their sour cream and pico de gallo. I was happy with the food and the price point. However, let me make it clear that this is not a good place for first dates, its more like a quick lunch/dinner type of place. They also offer fresh orchatas and aguas frescas. They do not have sodas machines so you can get a cold coke in a bottle or your typical can soda! Either way this is a good and cheap mexican restaurant to try!",

    "text": "I first found out about Pancho's Kitchen through the Fresh 52 Farmer's Market at Tivoli Village. I've tried three of their most popular dishes: tacos, burrito bowl, and tamales.  Tacos: I normally get carne asada tacos. I love that they melt cheese on the tortilla and then put the steak directly on top, so when you bite into the taco you get a perfect mixture of both flavors. I also love that they cook the steak on the crispy side, so it has a nice char taste to it.  Bowl: I typically get carne asada for their burrito bowls, but I highly recommend asking them to put the veggies they put from their vegetarian bowls in the steak bowl--there's a great mixture of cauliflower, zucchini, lettuce, and tomatoes.  Tamale: their vegetarian tamales are the way to go! Love the flavors and textures you get from the veggies they have in there. The sweet corn and carnitas tamales are delicious as well.  A must try!",

We were in the neighborhood and found it on Yelp.  And it DID NOT disappoint!  They have a good size meat based menu, and another separate vegan menu. I had the taco plate, with an avocado and one a mushroom one.  My husband had the burrito with potatoes.  Both were delectable.  Honestly, one of the best Mexican meals we have ever had (and we eat Mexican so much it's kinda embarrassing).  We will be making the trek from Mountains Edge here again!  Do not hesitate to eat here!  Meat or vegetable based diets will be happy with their menus.  So good!",

I tried two different fillings, lime cilantro mushroom and poblano zucchini.   The tacos were LEGIT. I especially liked the lime cilantro mushroom but the poblano zucchini was good as well. The rice that it was served with was light, not greasy or salty. Everything was so full of flavor.   The only disappointing part of the entire dining experience was that I filled up on the tacos and had no room for desert. Haha.   Will definitely be back. All you vegan folks out there, this is a must try! You can thank me later.",

Walking in here for the first time I noticed the lovely decor, cute paper flowers hanging from the ceiling, the large comfy booths and the word vegan listed on the wall with all the other things they offer.   Our waitress was an effecient, sweet young woman. We ordered quite a bit of food since there was 5 of us, 4 of us vegan. There was a little mix up with our drinks but it was resolved quickly.   They offer so much for vegans including enchiladas, burritos and other traditional Mexican cuisine. They also have a taco Tuesday that you can get veganized as well.   The food came out quickly as well. I ordered the loaded french fries with beer battered avocado. Omg it was so good!   The prices are a bit higher here but they give you good portions and awesome food.",

It was good but had a weird taste. Not sure if it was a specific vegetable. Id probably order it again just to double check   One thing i definitely recommend is either provide more free chips n salsa, or one for each meal getting person (at least). The complimentary chips n salsa is actually one of the best things of a lot of Mexican restaurants imo.",

I think maybe if they put a little more seasoning (or put some seasoning in it) the food would have been better.  Although I'm not vegan, i thought it was nice that they offer both a vegan and a regular menu. We went with the regular.  I like to try out new , different Mexican restaurants and felt as though this one didn't offer much of a selection as far as lunch/dinner goes.  I rate it 2/5 stars simply because me and my party weren't satisfied with our food.  I also didn't like how their bathroom door is part glass.  Although it's a little translucent, I felt as other could see me if they passed by considering there is no stalls, it is a one person bathroom.",

We ordered them and were served 12 chips (greasy & tough), along with a tablespoon of salsa. We also ordered the 3 taco combo (carnitas), which included rice & beans. The meat was blah & unidentifiable & the rice & beans would each fit in a ketchup cup. This is our one & only visit! Thank goodness Las Vegas has multiple Mexican restaurants to choose from. My advice? Try a different restaurant!",

    "text": "I'm gonna start off with stating the food tastes amazing! It is full of flavor, and their menu has plenty of options.  Since I started school in December I've been religiously buying lunch and even breakfast items from them. I would call ahead or even order through yelp so that it would be done by my lunch time. Back then portions were so big that I struggled to finish them (which I did finish because I love food) but recently I've been feeling disappointed! The portions have gotten significantly smaller, and I really don't understand why. They're less than half than what I used to get. But the price is still the same. I've been feeling kinda cheated, especially since I always call way ahead of time to give them enough time and not have to feel pressured to get my order out. The fries used to be a great portion for two, super cripsy and well seasoned. But the last two times I've gotten fries they were undercooked and not seasoned at all. It just sucks because I have so many months left in school right next door and now I have to go somewhere else for lunch.  The waitresses are the best, they are so attentive and kind. Always take my order perfectly. But something is going on in that kitchen that isn't right. It is way overpriced for the amount they're starting to give out. What a shame.  Also this ONLY applies to the take out orders!! I've eaten at the restaurant with my husband when we have lunch together, and the portions were big and I had no complaints. That is why I'm able to compare it to what they give you for take out.  UPDATE: I ordered berries pancakes and paid extra for the berries, I received plain pancakes. Its like a way different price for each.",

Not realizing that they closed in a hour once we arrived we decided to do take out to not stay & hinder them from closing. Upon arrival there was ONE family dining in (should have taken that as a sign)especially on a Sunday evening. Since the kitchen is pretty open you can see them cooking. I literally watched one of the cooks put a styrofoam to-go container in the microwave. I hoped it wasn't my food but it turned out to be so. As we pulled off & got to the light I checked the food & the fries were SOGGY! Seems they must have turned the fryers off & in a haste cooked my food in warm oil which resulted in not cooked soggy fries. My husband was pretty irritated as he threw it in the trash before we could even get in the house therefore there's no picture of the lack luster food. Oh & lastly the meat was season less & not edible. Needless to say I won't be back here again!",

    "text": "On my first trip to Vegas, this is one of the restaurants that came up when I searched for vegan food. I first ordered through UberEats, and was genuinely surprised at how good it was. I then decided to come into the restaurant. The customer service here is lovely. The atmosphere is authentically mexican. They had cumbia music playing as well as some classic songs playing in the background. You walk in and can take a seat wherever. The waitress then asks if we wanted to see a regular menu or a vegan menu. We took one of both. (My sister is not vegan) While I waited I ordered their vegan michelada which was delicious!! I then ordered the vegan chile relleno. It was lovely except I personally like to eat mine with vegan sour cream. We ordered the loaded fries with grilled veggies and I finally got to eat some corn on the cob! I have not been able to eat corn like the elotero man makes it in so long, and this one was just how i remember them *insert crying emoji* Even my non vegan sister enjoyed the corn.   My one pet peeve with vegan mexican food is when they over do it with the spices. Its an over kill for me. This place DID not disappoint, It AUTHENTIC mexican food, with meat or no meat! Highly recommend for everyone to try!!! Vegan or non-vegan.",

I have asked for the salad with the pickled onions because it's so good and I never know when they are going to include it as side or not. But even then half the time it doesn't come with the onions or it's a different dressing. It's hard to explain what you want on the phone if you have modifications if you don't speak Spanish. The mushroom is well marinated and the fried avocado is great for a cheat meal for vegans. I just wish it was more consistent and better customer service. I called for 30 min yesterday and they didn't answer. Had to go in to place my order and then had to wait and they still didn't remember what I ordered.",

    "text": "So yesterday I went with my two year old. Mind you i usually go 2-3 times a month and order off of the vegan menu  and always get very nice waitresses that always let me sit where ever I want with my son I think they kind of know me now. Yesterday was the most horrible experience ever. There is a waiter who is I believe is  around 50 yrs old with white hair. Mind you also I drive pretty far from centennial just to go to my favorite vegan Mexican food. I got there very excited to have breakfast with my son which is usually very well behaved. I always sit in the round booths with a high chair and was never told I couldn't. In fact this horrible waiter has let me sit with high chair there before A while back maybe few months ago. When I got there yesterday he pointed me to the other side where there's single person tables which I know aren't big enough for the amount of food I usually order. I told him the other times I have gone they always let me sit in a booth with the high chair and I wanted to sit in a booth he gave me a small attitude how I couldn't sit in the booth I normally sit because of a \"fire hazard\". Then I told him I always sat there an never had a problem. Then  he said i could sit there after he insisted I couldn't sit there. After I had to give hin explanations to why if I always sit in the same table. He finally agreed after arguing with me which it upset me. Then after I sat my heavy son in the high chair. he kept on mentioning in an annoying way how it is a fire hazard after he just told me I could sit there. So I responded  with then why are you agreeing and still pretty much complaining to me. I got upset because first of all I'm pregnant who likes to be moving a a 30 lb 2 yr old from table to table. So I said you know what I'm leaving. He told me to stay and sit there but I had enough. He acted like if he was the owner or something. I have never been embarrassed like that. I always tip very well and like I said my son is pretty respectful and well behaved. Next time I go there I am going to make sure I call to make sure he is not there. Which is very unpleasant. I used to refer this place to all my friend like there's no tomorrow always talking very excellent about it. I hope they do something about this guy. He is a bad apple and he's going to rot everything else's. Excellent food but horrible waiter that makes you not want to ever go back.",

We also ordered the Chicken Enchilada's, which was fairly spicy but incredibly delicious.  Don't expect a lot of Chips and Salsa, however. At PK's that might be a good thing. Load up on Taco's and Tamales instead. :)  A mom and pop operation, they're located right next door to Norm's Eggs Cafe on Durango, just south of Spring Mountain. Limited indoor seating. The inside could use a bit of sprucing up, but if all you care about is ambiance and not the meal itself, then head over to Pancho's in Downtown Summerlin instead for their rendition of bland and overpriced Mexican Food (ya, $18 burritos? No thanks.). At Pancho's Kitchen you get flavor for half the price. Great vegan options as well. Definitely coming back!",

All the food was very good, but again, THE SOUP! Wow. Can't stop thinking about it.  I'm also a big sucker for anywhere with live entertainment. If you sit in the bar area, you get just that on the weekends. They even have a stage, that's how serious they are. When we were there, it was a very charming couple that sang and playing the keyboard. They were amazing! They played songs people know and could sing along, too. After a couple margaritas, I definitely sang along to a lot of them.  Great spot if you're looking for some good grub and are in the Summerlin area.",

The sauce they use is really good but they only give you a litttttttle bit on top. That was actually my favorite part of the meal, the sauce. Lol Everything else was just ok. I also didn't expect it to be spicy so I guess that's my fault LOL but the spice level was tolerable. Just happy they offer vegan options so thanks, guys!",

Our hour lunch break took closer to an hour and a half. Its a good thing one in our group is my boss.  I ordered a carne asada burrito on this visit. It was a good size burrito with tender beef and lots of rice. There was a drizzle of sour cream and guacamole over it. I'm fine with all of that but the way it was presented was a problem for me. It was on a metal tray and laid across a piece of thin deli paper. It was impossible to eat with a fork and knife without getting a bit of paper in each bite. But it also was difficult to pick up to eat due to the sour cream and guac drizzles. Still, a tasty burrito.  My group ordered chips and salsa to share. A little hit and miss here. The chips were clearly freshly fried which is nice but some chips were excessively oily. And the salsa was too mild for me. It wasn't bad salsa but could have used a little more character.   Service was friendly but, again, slow. And the food was mostly good but a little problematic. So for those reasons, 3.5 rounded up to 4 stars for Pancho's.",

Great customer service, very clean restaurant and the atmosphere is very chill. I ordered guacamole however the waiter told me they did not have anymore but instead he did bring chips & salsa. Which I loved the salsa. I added meat to my order which I liked the fact that even though the plate I ordered typically does not include meat the meat waiter did not mind making this adjustment. I do want to return again and taste the vegan sopes.",

My vegan son really liked the veggie asada fries and vegan churros but was not impressed by the order of potato tacos. Hubs got the 3 taco plate. He got carne asada, carnitas and Al pastor. Carnitas and Al pastor were bland and the carne asada was too fatty he said. I got carne asada nachos to share with my daughter and I can not believe I'm saying this but, Roberto's taco shop does it better (and cheaper) so that says a lot! The flavor was good but the steak was inedible! All gristle and fat! Very very dissapointing! Might stop in again for vegan food when son is in town and we are on that side of town but would not go otherwise.",

We started off with a couple of draft beers on tap, great selection, small mugs. Happy Hour only on Tuesday.I ordered the chicken and steak fajitas and it came sizzling hot, very tasty and a good portion, however the rice and beans served with it, though very tasty was a pretty small portion. We also ordered the green Chile Chicken Posole and my wife thought it was excellent. The Service very good, friendly and helpful. We met the owners, and talked with Francisco, young and passionate and says he gets lots of vegan business. Overall it was a very good experience very tasty food, a bit pricey. It closes  depending on the day, between 7 & 8 PM and opens a 9am",

    "text": "It may not seem fair to judge by delivery services, but you know what they say about 'first impressions', and it just so happens that we form our first impressions of a lot of restaurants, via how they handle delivery orders, since it's a lot more convenient for us these days. When an order goes very well in terms of food quality, timeliness and service, we're definitely inclined to give the place a spin in-person. Pancho's, however, WON'T be one of those places.  We attempted to place an order with them a few weeks back through Grubhub, a service we use that has been reliable for the most part.  The online breakfast listings were really appealing, and we couldn't wait to try them!   Yet, a FULL HOUR after the order was placed, I went to check the progress to see where things were...and the order had been CANCELLED.  Immediately, I contacted Grubhub, and of course was told that I would need to contact the restaurant.  So I called Pancho's. The girl on the phone \"stum-fumbled\" badly through a weak explanation of how they attempted to contact me (my phone was beside me on my desk the entire time, and I received no voice mail messages or texts), about placing an alternative order, since the items we had requested WERE NO LONGER BEING OFFERED BY THE RESTAURANT.  Pardon my Francais, but WITAF??? You have items on your menu that are no longer featured, but you don't bother to update them on your site or the delivery service website as well? If you can't get THAT together, what would it be like to go to the actual place to have a meal? Fortunately, we'll never have to find out.",

So I ended up getting the churros with chocolate ice cream. She brought me vanilla ice cream instead which I was fine with but then realized that I ordered chocolate and brought me chocolate as well. I was not going to turn that down! I enjoyed both ice cream's but shockingly, the vanilla was a little better than the chocolate as far as flavor and texture goes.

I recommend the vegan burrito with beer-battered avocados. They have a decent beer selection with multiple beers on tap. They also have vegan horchata.

We asked for some pico.....and waited and waited. I watched our server go to the back, talk for a bit, make some other stuff...and waited and waited. It was just too much.

For $45 with the BIGIF coupon, lunch was not worth the price.  Iced tea was $4?  Mediocre Mexican food at very expensive prices.  Not worth the drive from Sun City.  Maybe other reviewers have so many drinks they forget how little they got for the $$$.  Far better food options at less expenses if you want True Mexican food.

I knew it didn't look right but the waiter insisted it was Vegan, as I took a bite he came running out of the kitchen yelling for me to stop and said that they made a mistake. Stopped by on my break to pick two Vegan bean and cheese burritos to go, got back to work and saw that I had two breakfast burritos. Not hard to make a bean and cheese burrito, not really sure how that gets messed up. I called in to complain, and the lady checked with kitchen and they assured me that my food was made vegan and that I could come back for what I had originally ordered. I did not go back. All and all the food is good but a little risky if you eat off the vegan menu. Think I'm done here based on the mistakes.",

Now for the disappointment. We ordered vegan fries with everything on it to go. Waited for 45 minutes and no one explained to us why the wait for one order was taking so long. I had to ask after 35 minutes why is it taking so long and the lady took another 10 min to get back to me. 45 min later, we got our to go food and the fries were soggy, and the vegan order had nothing special about it. Tasted just like something I usually whip up at home. For $14, was not worth the 45 min wait to only eat something super simple-tasting. Will not return.",

Would order both items again but not until I've had the mushroom tacos and the chile poblano green enchilada.  The tamale was good, especially if you're a fan of swiss chard which was a really nice addition. I ordered it with salsa, beans and rice, $8.50. Good beans. Not Frank and Fina's good, but close and better than most I've tried in Vegas. Their spicy salsa that comes with it is pretty good and decently hot.  Pancho's is not fancy by any stretch of the imagination. It's small and quaint with only a handful of tables and walk-up ordering at the counter. The service is great, food is made fresh and they showed us lots of hospitality.",

    "text": "Being from Southern California, we do two things well: Vegan food and Mexican food. Yet, there are surprisingly very few Mexican restaurants that offer vegan options. Pancho's Kitchen has a full menu devoted to just vegan dishes. After being greeted by the friendly young lady at the counter, I opted for the #1 (vegan tamal with rice and beans) and my boyfriend ordered three different tacos with rice and beans.   Because they were out of avocados for the avocado taco, my boyfriend was trying to choose between the bean taco or the poblano and zucchini taco. She kindly suggested that they could combine the two for him, which was a really nice gesture and just a small taste of the great customer service they displayed.   As the food came out, everything was hot and meticulously prepared. They put a little bit of vegan pepper jack cheese (Daiya, I believe) on my beans, which is the way I would do it at home as well. The masa encasing my tamal was the most delicious and flavorful I've ever tasted. It was a good size as well and left me feeling content after I finished my plate rather than heavy and sluggish. The young lady helping us said they were her favorite and she wasn't lying, it was the best vegan tamal I've ever had and that's considering my grandma's homemade non-vegan ones I ate back in the day.   My boyfriend was so pleased with all of his tacos. I gave preference to the potato taco due to the crispness and the amount of cabbage and salsa amassed on top of it, however the other two were just as delicious (especially in regards to the homemade tortillas).   Too bad this place is not in Southern California. We really lost a good one to Las Vegas' authentic Mexican (and vegan) food scene.",

Unfortunately they were out of the lemonade on the day I went to their restaurant & they don't have all of their various salsas in store. However, she offered to make me some regular lemonade which was nice & the red & green hot sauces they provide are good. I like that they give you a whole squeeze bottle to use so you can put on as much as you like. The carnitas & asada tacos are solid. They seem a bit pricey at $2.50 ea or $9 for a plate w/rice & beans but they are tasty. They don't skimp on the cilantro like most places & the queso is a nice touch. They also give you a few chips if you eat there so that makes it worth it, for sure! I never order beverages w/my meals but I'll definitely be back for that cucumber lemonade also!",

Go to Panchos Tacos and order the full nachos with the melted cheese  Panchos Tacos is much better !",

Let me tell you that these things wouldn't fill up a toddler.   The place was clean and the food was fresh tho. Very high priced for a mexican restaurant in my opinion.

Now they have it going on!   Smiling faces, EXCELLENT service and flavorful food.  And the best part?!?! No Daiya! Thats right NO DAIYA! (maybe Follow Your Heart?)  I never order sweet but I had to try the horchata (its vegan!) and its made with almond milk. It was good but too sweet for my taste.  The loaded nachos (vegan) are amaze...halfway through I realized I was eating all the veggies, like green beans and colorful carrots! Who said nachos can't have nutritional value ;)   The burrito (vegan) was packed with yumminess not even sure what because I could only sat one bite.  The potato tacos (vegan) were best best I have ever tasted. I wanted more but only ate a few bites because I eat oil free and didn't want to push my tummy.  I'll be back to study their beans and rice.....why are they soo good?!?! Why?!?! I have tried for years to slow cook my beans and theirs......are truly amazing.  A tried a tiny tasting of three items and I'm sold. I need to go back and try their breakfast and mushroom tacos!",

Very disappointing, being a vegan I look to the net for guidance and referrals to the best or hot vegan spots: this was a definite bust; oh and to make matters worse! The cook came to greet a friend in assuming and give her the food she ordered, as she greeted him she's like what's up Nigga, not an any racially charged tone, but the young lady knew she was out of line right away as she looked Back with the cook as though they both Did something wrong.

    "text": "Tuesdays have now become my favorite day of the week because why? $2 VEGAN TACOS, that's why!!!   I can't get enough of how amazing this place is and how it perfectly caters to my Mexican food cravings! They have Happy Hour all day on Tuesdays with tacos priced at $2 each (except the fish and the shrimp) as well as a variety of drinks such as beers and Micheladas discounted from their regular price. They also have a separate vegan menu so any and all members of your party can enjoy all that Pancho's has to offer!   I cannot explain enough how delicious the vegan tacos are! My non-vegan friends even ordered off the vegan menu and actually ended up really loving their choices. I definitely recommend to try each of the tacos that come in the base choices of: potatoes, cilantro-lime mushroom, beer battered avocado, and zucchini poblano. One bite and I swear you can't even tell that it's vegan! Also other recommendations would be the vegan horchata (made with almond milk) and their veggie fries.    Love the atmosphere of the place! The restaurant has a lot of seating which allows us to always get seated immediately. There are also various TV displays of reggaeton music videos playing that make me dance while I eat my delicious food!!  You also get complimentary chips and salsa with your order so you have something to snack on while you wait.    Definitely recommend trying this place out, you won't be disappointed!",

I had an event and I had to feed 50 people so luckily Francisco was able to help me with one days notice. 100 TACOS (steak and chicken), beans, rice, salsa, and dessert. Everyone loved the food, they were crazy about it. I wish I had taken a few menus for all of the people who were asking me where I ordered the food from. Also, every time I dine in, the restaurant is clean and the waitresses are so sweet and accommodating. Great salsa too. Thank you guys for making my event a success!! See you soon",

It was really a breath of fresh air that they had a complete, real, multiple choice (very dramatic I know) menu to choose from that was completely vegan.   Since my vegan introduction I have come to appreciate how many Mexican dishes you can make vegan. This place took my appreciation to a new level.   I ordered two potato enchiladas and one fried avocado enchilada. They were toppled with vegan cheese and sour cream. Everything tasted fresh and really complemented one another. The rice and beans were good as well, oh and before I forget, make sure you get their fresh guacamole as well!  For dessert I had some wonderful concoction of ice cream and fried chips, I forgot what it was called, but its a must try. And yes, that was vegan too.   Their customer service didn't lack either.   If you want some vegan mexican food while in vegas, this is the place to go!",

The chips and salsa was about the same, where is the spice? I tasted tomato and cilantro... thats it...... I know everyone is excited about the vegan options here, but if there is no spice and no flavor then what is the point?????? My husband had the carne asada burrito and he said it was good, not great.... probably can't talk him into trying it again because of the huge options of Mexican food here in Vegas.",

I received 3 potato tacos and they were crispy and delicioso. I requested no pico de gallo since I don't like tomatoes, however, I got mucho de gallo instead.  It's ok; I brushed it aside, although I lost a lot of my salsa.  The beans and rice were ok, but I could've used a tad bit more sabor (flavor) in both.  The nachos were ok. The portion was huge and I love that it was piled high with veggies.  I asked for both spicy red salsa and the green salsa.  I only received a small amount of red salsa; enough for the potato tacos only.  My nachos would've been a lot better to me with more spicy salsa.    They did not have any vegan desserts (I asked).   Inside is small, but comfy, like abuelita's cocina.  The lady at the counter was very pleasant.  Prices are reasonable. Located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking. I'd go back for more potato tacos and to try other menu items.",

I wasn't originally going to order off the vegan menu , but I decided to give the vegan fajitas a try and they were everything I never knew I needed! The dish came with portabello mushrooms instead of meat and with the seasonings that were on them I felt that I was hardly missing out on anything! The portions are perfect, it's not an overwhelming amount of food and it's easy to finish your whole meal without being left hungry. I came with a party of around 15 people and the service was very impressive. Extremely friendly and attentive and I'm super excited to come back and try everything else out :)",

She gave me a dollar off. WTF?! And their coupon is in the entertainment book again this year!  That stunt and the food being subpar really makes me sad. No longer a fan of Pancho's.",

Craving tacos and missing \"Al Pastor and Carne Asada,\" I decided to venture in to Panchos as people have raved about their vegetarian/vegan tacos.   The place is small and has a super clean, family owned Robertos feel to it. The food was super fresh and made to order. There weren't huge vats of food needing to be reheated.  I got the special of the day: 2 tacos (any kind), beans, rice, and a can of soda for $7.99. Not too shabby. I also picked up some carne asada tacos for my roommate and an order of the shrimp empanadas.  The empanadas were made-to-order and the lady told me it would be a 15 minute wait. No problemo! The empanadas were definitely worth the wait! The MAIN reason I'm willing to give this place another go!  The potato tacos (carbs on carbs, yo) were okay. They weren't amazing, the weren't good, they were okay. Along with the vegetarian beans, and the rice. They did have vegan cheese which pleased me greatly. (I don't know why I like it so much because it doesn't taste like cheese, at all.) The homie really enjoyed the her tacos, agreed about the lackluster beans and rice and raved about the shrimp empanadas!  I really struggled with 3-4 stars, but they forgot my sodas and the tacos were just a-okay. I will be back to explore the menu more.",

    "text": "My new spot for to go Mexican!  Ingredients are from local farmers market, and even have a Vegan Menu.  Wouldn't think that it would be possible to clean up Mexican food, but this place did it!  Mexican food is and always will be heavier and saucy, however Pancho's lighter use of oil and decision to veer away from lard has not led the food to lack any flavor.  All dishes are made fresh to order, including sopes. The only item I believe to be pre made are the tortillas.  The green enchiladas covered in a light spicy green chile sauce have a heavenly flavorsome sauce that, depending on who's cooking in the kitchen, can be light and fluffy as cotton or thicker and saucier- all the same both have great savor.  Once the chicken was diced up on the enchilada, another time shredded.  So not always consistent here on preparation, but consistently palatable. If you're lucky enough to catch them when they have blue corn, their blue corn sopes are scrumptious! Well cooked with a light crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, you can tell they are freshly made. The difference in white or yellow vs. blue corn are subtle (blue had a slight nutty flavor) but if I see blue corn on a menu I always go for it. The Vegan Menu- how neat is it to see this at a take out Mexican spot? I ordered the vegan tamale and it did not lack any of the toothsome-ness the regular items had.  Vegan can be delicious!  The corn masa was wrapped in chard (which was exquisite by the way) and stuffed with local farmers market veggies such as squash and corn, all seasoned generously. This dish did not disappoint!  Pancakes.  At a Mexican take out? Yes, and they are worth ordering.  Chocolate chip pancakes made fresh smothered in chocolate and condensed milk, decadent!  Bye bye iHop! Posole had two separate experiences with this, one spicy one not.  But you can definitely tell this soup is made in a clean way, doesn't have the sticky gelatinous flavor to the soup.  In my opinion, Mexican is difficult to make upscale or fine dining (case in point I've been to Javier's, but I'll save that for another review).  However, Pancho's is a little shop with 3 workers that act as server, cashier and cook who make well-prepared mouthwatering Mexican food.  Home cooking at its finest. Taking a star down for a couple reasons.  1. The wait.  I've ordered ahead of time as far in advanced as 1 hour and still waited an extra 15 min when I got there.  2.  Consistency.  As mentioned earlier, dishes were prepared differently depending on the chef, sauces had different textures and meats done according to whomever was cooking. Wrapping it up, good ol' wholesome home cooked Mexican food with Vegan options and all made with the health conscious in mind.  Order ahead because you'll have to wait!",
