    "text": "I came here with my entire family after a whole day of noshing. I wasn't necessarily hungry but I had no choice. We normally go to the Sahara location and it was my first time at this location which is close to my aunt's house. I love the interior...classy-looking for a pizza place.   My favorite is their goat cheese pizza but that's what I always get so it was time to try something different. We got the brie cheese and truffle oil thin crust pizza, wagyu burgers and mini kobe beef burgers.  Brie Cheese and Truffle Oil Thin Crust Pizza: I love brie and truffle/truffle oil. Our server warned me this was going to be very truffly and fragrant - it was not the case. The brie was strong enough to subdue the truffle oil a bit. 4/5  Kobe Beef Sliders: The beef patty was juicy. The gorgonzola was great with the burger. Comes with fries. 3.5/5  We had a few family members with very specific requests which were all granted. So, I can't complain. The service was great. Their menu seems it has more items compared to the Sahara location.",

We ordered the edamame with toasted sesame seeds, truffle fries sprinkled with romano cheese, crispy coconut shrimp skewers served with an orange-horseradish sauce, hummus with grilled herb flatbread, and a margherita wood fired pizza. Everything was great! I   Really enjoyed the sauce that was served with the coconut shrimp! Loved the way they grilled the herb flatbread that came with the hummus! And of course- the pizza was delicious also!   Sammy's is a great choice!",

I can always count on it always being made the same and perfect. My mother's last birthday was at Sam's a few years back.  She passed away 3 months later. The picture of the Giant mountain of Cotten Candy is such a great memory to have. My grandkids love the kids menu pizza and of course The Messy Sundae is a favorite. Love, love, love Sammy's.",

    "text": "I was really excited about Sammy's especially from all the great reviews at the Yelp Elite Event. Unfortunately it fell a little short for me. However, I am willing to go back again and give it another try.   We ordered the Mediterranean Appetizer, Waygu burger, pear prosciutto and arugula pizza as well as the toffee dessert.   The appetizer was delicious. I would order it again, the babaganoush and the cheese were my favorites.   The Burger - Oh how we wanted to love you. The patty was well cooked and delicious, the bun was a soggy wet mess. It literally fell apart. I will attach a pic of what the bun looked like once we got it. He ended up just eating the burger alone and taking the remains of the bun off altogether.   The Pizza- Delicious! It was a bit heavy on the cheese but I liked it.   The Dessert- It tasted pretty good however it wasn't warm at all, not even room temperature. I asked the waitress if it was supposed to be warm ... I kid you not 18 minutes later she still said she had no idea. It was confirmed at the end by the chef it should have been.   Management did comp our dessert which was very nice but not necessary.   Service- Extremely slow, asked for napkins and we never got them. Had to ask for water after our glasses were empty. Our waitress was nice however she really wasn't around, Multiple people in our section complained about her. We waited about 10 minutes just to get the bill, then the waitress said she forgot and we had to wait some more.   I'm hoping we just caught them on an off day. I like the ambiance and the location is perfect. Our waitress suggested we wait a couple more weeks before returning because its \"crazy\".   We will do just that: be back in November Sammy's.",

    "text": "I definitely enjoyed sitting inside this restaurant during my lunch break from work. I love all of the windows and natural light that brightens up the dining area. Even though it was chilly due to the AC, I loved how clean and modern the restaurant is now. I also heard that when it is nice outside they open up the sliding doors which would be wonderful!  I went to Sammy's for a work lunch break. One friend got the BBQ woodfired pizza, another got the Kobe burger, another person got the sliders, someone who has come to Sammy's often got the duck tacos, and I got the Balsamic Chicken Salad that was gluten free friendly.   My salad was way overdressed. Painfully overdressed to be honest. The chicken was a little dry too. However, it was still a little enjoyable, but I was sad I didn't get the shrimp salad or the Kobe Beef Chili which were also gluten free friendly.   My buddy said the duck tacos are always good, never too greasy, and he ate them all! One of the best things on the menu! The BBQ pizza looked good, supposedly tasted pretty good, but not going to lie, he said he has had better pizza nearby. It was a nice portion though and smelled delicious!  The sliders got a thumbs up, but he said to go with truffle fries since the basic fries are just that. Basic. The Kobe burger was delicious (per my fellow employee) and juicy. Good sized portions without being obnoxious.   Overall, the experience was good. I won't be running back to come here immediately, but I will come back to try other items on the menu. One of the guys in our party say he's never been disappointed, so I'll give it another go! Plenty of gluten free and vegetarian options which is great!   I'd say worth a try!",

My brother ordered the goat cheese pizza and bit down only to find a SCREW attached to a plastic frame baked into his pizza. A manager was called over and she proceeded to take the plate and didn't acknowledge  that there was a literal SCREW in his food. Not only could he have choked but he could have bitten down and had a screw in his gums. She took his pizza off of the bill and gave us a \"birthday dessert\" but she should have covered the entire $80 bill! We spent so much money to have a good time and our appetites were ruined within minutes. I want to speak to the higher ups because apparently the day managers don't know how to handle potentially dangerous situations correctly.",

Every time I have ever dined here, I am pretty blown away by the attentiveness of the staff.  I also really love the ambiance. You can sit at the bar and watch the game, dine at a normal booth or table, or in nicer temps, they have opening glass doors to a beautiful garden area. If you sit on that side, the booths are more like couches. Perfect for a larger group, or family dinner.  There are a few menu items that stand out to me. The mini duck tacos, the lobster mac & cheese, and as small as it may seem, the freakin' cheesy garlic bread is pretty bomb. The salads are huge, and the pizza is decent.  Plenty of selections, including unique options like lamb, and meat cooked on a hot stone right at the table.  All of the desserts are to die for. Even the huge plate of cotton candy that is enough sugar for 10 kids!  I will continue to dine here, but it will never be my first choice. Unless it's for cocktails. Great selection. Props to the entire staff for being awesome.",

My husband and I consider ourselves very patient and understanding people but we left Sammy's last night extremely agitated.   My husband, 19-month-old son, and I arrived yesterday around 5 pm and were seated promptly. The restaurant was still pretty vacant when we got there. Our server, Ramon, came and took our drink order and then vanished. He finally came back 10 minutes later to take our food order. Our food was delivered while it was still hot. However, our waiter never returned to check on us. We finished our entire meals without seeing our waiter. Our waiter finally arrived 15 minutes after we finished our meal and handed us the check (he never asked us if we needed anything else or how the food tasted). He vanished again! Finally, I told my husband to take my son to the car while I waited. Another waiter walked by me and I asked him to take care of our check. He graciously agreed.   I don't mind waiting longer when a restaurant is busy. However, we never saw our waiter walking around. Nothing irritates me more in a restaurant than when I feel like a \"hostage\" (can't refill my drink, can't leave, etc) because the waiter is no where to be found!",

Apparently, the scheduling manager at Sammy's did not! We arrive at 11:15 for our reservation and we're seated quickly. It was clear that they had understaffed. Both managers were running food and there were about 3-4 servers on the floor. It took about 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and after 40 mins our food arrived, cold. Imagine a cold Eggs Benedict and a asparagus scramble, not good. I will never send food back usually, but after that kind of wait, the food had better be good. We returned both our dishes to be remade, after another 20 mins our food arrived and mine was a completely different meal! It was so bad it was laughable. I sent that back and just enjoyed the side of pancakes we ordered. Sure, Sammy's removed the meal from the menu, as expected and none of this was the fault of the server, she was slammed with tables, but it's nothing short of poor management. How do you not staff up for Mother's Day!?! On top of this, the food was bland. Something needs to be reassessed here because with each visit it's getting worse.",

It's a perfect balance of spicy (arugula), sweet (fig), salty (feta), and tangy (vinaigrette). That was certainly a highlight of yesterday's visit.  The margherita pizza was interesting. Sammy's interpretation is sliced roma tomatoes and julienned basil on top of melted mozzarella. I usually don't do too many raw tomatoes, but I nonetheless dug it. I'd order it again.  Without a doubt, Sammy's is still one of the top dining spots in Green Valley. If you have any doubts, try any of Sammy's pizzas and you'll understand.",

    "text": "I was REALLY dissappointed last night at Sammy's.  Usually this place is on point with their salads, pizza, and happy hour.  But last night was such an exception that I felt I needed to write this poor review. First of all, they were out of skinny margarita mix.  On a Friday night??  Really??  So, I settled for a Moscow mule which showed up in the wrong glass.  Our server said it was because they didn't have any more copper mugs.  As I drank it, I found something in my ice.  It looks like the stem of something...but it was frozen in the ice....so it must have been there for a while.  The server apologized and said she would have another drink made for me.  This one showed up in the right glass!  So they were or they weren't out of them??  She explained to me that the \"thing\" in my ice was a part of the mint.  It was definetely NOT part of the mint.  But whatever...I'll move on from the drinks. The Kobe sliders were ordered medium and showed up well.  The flatbread was greasy.  The Chinese chicken salad was spicier than normal, and the New York pizza was awful.   The service was ridiculous.  We could see that she was busy and I noticed managers running food, but we were there for 2 hours and the service never got any better.  We had no silverware at one point, no water for 20 minutes.  I usually give servers a break because I used to be one....but it was bad.  Not bad enough for me to call the server out online, though. In conclusion, I won't be returning to Sammy's for a good long while.  It's too bad, too, because it used to be great.  Hope they work out their \"kinks\" soon.",

Like all Sammy's, the menu is fantastic and the service is great. The salads meals by themselves and seriously could feed two people. The red quinoa salad and the greek salads are among my faves. Pizza is very good here too. But save room for dessert! I feel like my experience isn't complete with out a messy Sunday.",

In addition, the food was lackluster - nothing special. We gave it another shot last weekend and came away very disappointed.  My husband ordered the chicken Caesar salad.  The dressing wasn't blended well and the chicken tasted like they microwaved it. I had the balsamic grilled chicken salad.  It tasted like soap. We complained to the manager about the Caesar salad.  His response was that no other customer complained about it all night and we were the only ones unhappy.  After this reaction, complaining about my salad was moot.  They took off the Caesar salad from our bill, but it did little to make up for such a bad experience.",

I was already impressed as soon as we were seated because they sat us at one of the best tables they had. The hostess sat us at the corner table that had a huge comfy couch. Our table was really nice because we had a view of the street and it was super super comfortable. Our server's name was Anthony (I think). We had wine questions and he was very helpful. After our drinks came we decided to start on their Mediterranean Dip Sampler and they were really amazing! My friends and I ordered own entrees and we were not disappointed at all with what we ordered. Then, as soon as we finished our meal and started talking about dessert our server placed a huge complimentary sundae on our table. The Messy Sundae is a must have because it's like being a little kid again. The sundae was a tall plastic wine glass that had vanilla ice cream in it with caramel and chocolate all over the whole thing topped with whipped cream. It was sooooooo good!  My overall opinion: I really like the ambiance of this place. Their furnitures are comfortable. I have no complaints at all about the service our server did a very good job. Their menu looks great. The price range is pretty reasonable. They have a decent wine and beer selections. For a place that opened just a few months ago, I think they are doing a pretty good job. :)",

After addressing this issue to the manager, I was told they were going take care of it. An hour later when I took my baby to change it was all the same. Then there was trash and dust next to the bar stand... Now I don't feel comfortable eating there, god knows how dirty is their kitchen.

I had to ask two other people for them to finally complete it. When our waiter came by, I asked what he recommended on the drink menu. His answer was that he had just transferred to this location , and he couldn't recommend a drink. .....aren't all Sammy's some what the same?   After our orders were taken, no one really checked on us. And when they did, they wouldn't clear our plates/ glasses. My sister at one point had three glasses of coke, just piling up.

    "text": "I'm only giving a three star because i actually love this place.... normally. The low rating is strictly for a particular bartender. The brunette bartender with the east coast accent has terrible customer service skills. I was there for over an hour and only got one drink, i placed my empty drink on the bar rail in front of me (in front of the machine) and patiently waited for another one. Didn't get it. Wanted to eat... never got a menu. Never offered a menu. There were two gentlemen on the bar next to me by the juke box and they got the most service. They got spectacular service. And she spent quite a while taking with them... guess i wasn't her preferential guest. Fine.  Then i had someone meet me... and when she came and ordered a drink.. the tonic was flat. After waiting 15 mins to see if the bartender would notice her guest not drinking... or asking if we needed anything (like a menu or players card... which we needed both) i finally told her about the drink. And waited patiently for it while she tried to figure out why another machine wouldn't work....   I'm a bartender too. So i get when things happen.... but this was ridiculous. I just know now to never come in when she's working.",

We had the Kobe beef sliders, duck tacos, arugula pear pizza, mozerella cheese pizza, and Thai chicken pizza. So good! Restaurant was clean, atmosphere was great. We have also come for breakfast, had marscapone French toast, and a Brie omelette. Both fabulous as well. The staff, kitchen, and dining room are on point.",

It would have been probably a good salad if everything didn't taste burnt.  It was a company lunch but this is all bad.  Then when I asked to bring it back because the chicken was burnt and salad tasted bitter they were cool about it and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes....I get there and the \"idiots\" only wanted to replace chicken only!  Nevertheless, the waitress was Pissy because I had eaten a small portion of the salad \"how else would I know it had tasted like burnt chicken\"? I got a replacement salad and when I got back to the office I got a totally different salad and wasn't what the company paid for....they are not worth the damn trouble to patronize this business again.",

Considering that I live about 3 minutes away, it is very pleasing to have another close by dining option.  I have enjoyed breakfast 3 times and dinner 4 times at this location.  I probably would have given it 5 stars if it had a slightly better selection on the menu...but of course YMMV depending on what you like.    All of my breakfasts there were very good, but a little expensive.  Dinners were also very good and a good value.  I've enjoyed pasta dishes, pizza and dinner salads...and would not hesitate to reorder any of them again.  One thing I do note is that this Sammy's is WAY better than the other Green Valley location that is now closed.  That one had me completely turned off to the place and I planned on never going back.  One other notable thing is that the environment is very appealing here, especially when they open up the sliding glass walls when the weather is nice.",

I LOVED the decor and the fact the huge windows opened up especially on a spring night. Side note - they actually went against health code violation because they have the open walls/windows so close to food service and the bar without fly fans.  the wait wasn't long at all and the place was packed, only one empty table. The food was also fast, the fastest of any restaurant I've been to.   Our waiter though was extremely awkward. He probably didn't know he was and maybe he was new? But the ipad ordering system may have had him confused because once I placed my order (out of 4 people) he sat there and typed trying to punch in my order for literally 3 minutes!!! we all just looked at each other like helllooo, are you ever going to say something like \"i'm sorry this is taking so long\" or \"what I can get for you sir\". Nothing, so awkward!!! And the fact he forgot our wine and the manager had to bring it to us was not really acceptable.   I ordered the chopped chicken salad which was just eh. I might have been comparing it to balboa's (which is amazing) but that's to each it's own.",

The restaurant was very busy but we did not have to wait too long for a table. The hostesses' attitudes felt abrasive and rushed. Our server was Anthony and boy were we lucky to have him. My husband being a smart-alec was firing out all sorts of questions about the menu and he answered them with ease. Anthony took us through the menu and highlighted some of the more popular items featured at Sammy's.   We ordered the crab stack, the dipping sampler and chicken meatballs...YUM!! For dinner we had a HUGE kale salad and a Hawaiian pizza.  Our meal was timed perfectly and we received new plates and silverware before our dinner came out. Everything was spot on. My family and I will definitely return soon with our friends. Maybe even dare to try the messy sundae :)",

It was not good from the beginning and went downhill from there.  The crab shrimp dip was ok but lacked flavor.  The pita given with it was just plain burnt on the bottom.  The kids angel hair pasta was clumpy and overcooked and the qlwagyu burger was impossible to eat as the bun was soggy and fell apart, the lettuce was bigger than the bun and the onions were not fully caramelized. The burger itself tasted good and that was all I ate. For desert we had the mini donuts. Again these were burnt so badly you could see the black spots.  The sauce was good.  I will say the service was great though and saved this review from being 1 star.",

Some sat at the bar which to me is a better place to sit if you want to keep your glass filled whether it be alcohol or not.  I had the Shrimp with Angel Hair Pasta and it had artichoke hearts, carrots, and zucchini squash which tasted really good. I had asked for some garlic bread but the closest they could come to was their cheesy bread which is more like a small 10 inch pizza, either way very tasty!  My friend had the Chicken Hummus wrap, I looked over and the plate was clean so I have to assume it was really good! ( I mean the plate even look licked clean!!!)  Marcus was our Bartender and was doing a good job of keeping up with the demanding crowd growing at the bar, plus the wait staff coming to get drinks as well, he was busy!!",

There was no seating area so we had stand and wait to be seated.   We finally got seated after 15min, the waitress got us our beverages and took our order.   Here is what I think of this place: - slow service/barely any service - dishes that are already on the table is dirty (still had old food residue) - portion size of the pizza is a bit bigger than your typical Sammy's but it's not the same because they do not have a brick oven to cook the pizza. And they didn't use the artisan crust for the Brie cheese w truffle oil \"artisan crust\" pizza - prices are a lot higher than your typical Sammy - it took over half hour to get our food and when we got it, it wasn't even what we ordered so we had to wait some more.  - place is very loud because if the high ceiling and glass surroundings  All in all my bf and I didn't like the place. We will stick to \"our\" Sammy's on 215 and rainbow where it's just much more intimate w great customer service.",

I just felt the chicken was a little dry and same with the beef.  I don't know if it's because of the wine pairing dinner that the food was that way; maybe they were mass producing things since it was busy.  I find chicken breast dry in nature, but this one was particularly dry.  Service was very good though, I must say!  I liked the atmosphere (I would probably love it if I were single....nice bar!) and might be back if I'm in Henderson, which is rare.",

    "text": "As long-time fans of the Sammy's on Sunset, we were pretty disappointed when it closed. The grilled chicken balsamic salad cravings finally got the best of us, and we decided to venture out and find the next closest location. We were immediately impressed by the new space. There were some more traditional seating options along with some tables surrounded by big, fluffy couches. We were seated at a corner table surrounded by a long, curving couch and we began our wait.   We waited for long enough for our server to greet us that we started to question whether we should go somewhere else. Just as we were getting up to leave, a server, Jules, hurried over to see what was wrong. She insisted that we stay and promised that they would take care of us.   And take care of us they did! Jules was really friendly and engaging. I got the feeling that she was providing excellent service because it was the way she operated rather than just because she was trying to smooth over a rough situation. At her suggestion, we ordered an array of happy hour tapas rather than the individual meals that we were familiar with. It turned out to be great advice. We would definitely go back during happy hour because it was so much fun to try so many different little tasty treats.   The rest of our experience was fantastic. The manager came over multiple times to make sure that we were satisfied. It took a little while for desserts to come out as the dinner crowd arrived, but it was a totally reasonable amount of time to wait for how busy it had gotten. The messy sundae was well worth the wait though. It was just as much fun to play with as it was to eat! The manger came by one more time to see us off and make amends on the check. We'll definitely be back.",

I asked the host if my boyfriend and I could park our bikes near the window so we could keep an eye on them. If course I forgot my bike lock. Thankfully they did not have a problem with it.   The bartenders are very polite and never rushing which was nice since I'm very indecisive. I sat and hung out for a while and tried a few items. Lobster mac n cheese really weak. I make better mac n cheese at home.  The fries are really good but make sure you order a side of ketchup or two if you like to dip it. The Kung Paw Calamari is more like steak calamari. It is really good so definitely try it. I was not impressed with the Crab & Shrimp dip. The bartender let me try the watermelon cooler which was not good. Nothing exciting about that which I was bummed cause it sounded refreshing.  It is convenient to grab a bite or a drink late night or a happy hour but not if I want a good meal.   Service: AMAZING Food: Overpriced and not that great",

    "text": "I haven't read any previous reviews as I don't want to be influenced.  We were very excited when we heard Sammy's was coming to the vacated former-Applebee's location 5 minutes from our home.  We went to Happy Hour on Friday.  It was crowded but we still got 2 seats at the bar.  First, the good news:  The Kobe burgers were exceptional, nice touch with the optional Gorgonzola cheese.  We liked the shrimp & artichoke dip, much better than the spinich-artichoke dip we had at the nearby Elephant Bar the night before.  The Thai chicken satays were good with an exceptional peanut sauce.  The house Chardonnay was Grey Cellars, I believe, at the discounted price of $5.50 a glass.  Not bad.  Some of the normal appetizers were half-price.  Again, not bad.  But, as a former bar manager at a high-volume restaurant-bar in Dallas and former restaurant owner, I was shocked by the very poor service at the bar.  This comes from an owner's perspective in that it was so slow and unattentive that a lot of money was left on the table, for the restaurant and the corresponding 20% tip.    The design and layout of the establishment is outstanding.  The south walls were totally open and the seating was very unique in certain areas giving you the feeling of being at somebody's home.  Fantastic!  The design of the bar did not anticipate any high volume.  The lower inner portion of the bar prevents close interaction from the barkeep with the customers.  They have to lean way over in spots to serve customers at the bar.  The width of the bar is not conducive for good assistance from bar-backs.  It is very crowded back there.  The bartenders are responsible for the high number of to-go orders phoned in.  The bartenders should be selling drinks and food while appeasing the clients at the bar, not serving up bags of already-ordered carryout meals.    Subsequently, we would have ordered at least one, probably two more rounds of drinks in the time we were there.  We could not get the attention of the bartender to give us our final tab for over 10 minutes.  Even after requesting the final bill, it took another 10 minutes to get our charge card ran.  Again, putting the \"owner cap\" on, the customer turnover at the bar would be much faster with better service at the bar.  Thus, the restaurant and the bartenders are losing money.  I know Sammy's owner is damn good.  Overall, his restaurants show that.  BUT, I wish he would have given me a phone call asking my advice on the setup of the bar.    We will come back, but never on a busy night.",

They did not intrude on our conversations and no one rushed us about anything.   At about 9:00 pm we stopped talking long enough to notice that the restaurant was 99.9% empty and apologized profusely to our server and others working there.  This was met with a \"no problem, we hope you enjoyed yourselves\".   We split hummus (beyond yummy), a spicy Italian Sausage Pizza (delicious) and a Caesar Salad (oh so good).  Needless to say, way to much food for the two of us.  Had enough for lunch the next day.  It has a little something for everyone and a full bar, which I always enjoy.  I have never been disappointed at Sammy's.  It's lively, very, very clean and easy to get to.",

    "text": "Update/January 2017:  After I had written my letter in June 2015, I reluctantly hoped that the level of service would rise and match the pleasant dining atmosphere and the great food that Sammy's has to offer. Indeed, we had not frequented Sammy's for over a year, thinking that instituting some necessary changes would take some time. Several months ago, we decided to return and were very pleasantly surprised that the level of customer service had improved a great deal. But, after several satisfactory visits, we found yesterday that things at your Henderson location had really not changed at all.  Yesterday evening, Saturday at 5pm, we were promptly seated at our table by a very friendly hostess, who recited the standard line that \"a server will be with us right away.\" This section of the restaurant was empty when we arrived and we were seated very near the hostess's reception desk and in plain view for all to see. During the 15 minute wait time, we witnessed some very astonishing events.  First, the hostess, who had seated us, seated an elderly couple next to us. As she walked by, she had not noticed that we had not been greeted by any server. Second, the busboy who was preparing a table for 12-14 next to us, walked by twice to move chairs and a table needed for the larger group. He also had not noticed that no one had greeted us. Third, and most disappointing of all, the manager on duty would never have noticed us because she was very busy displaying her new manicure to the hostess. After 15 minutes of holding menus and not being offered a glass of water in an empty section of the restaurant, we concluded that no one cared whether we stayed or departed. So, we departed Sammy's, disappointed once again. Our departure triggered a reaction that was totally unexpected. The manager with the fresh manicure ran after us in the parking lot. Apparently, someone had alerted her that we had left and she confronted us, mumbling something about inviting us back in, and taking care of something..... By then, we had decided to eat elsewhere.  I need not remind you that we have very many dining choices in the area. Our favorites are Elephant Bar, Black Mountain Grill, Pin Kaow Thai, and Kabuki. Please direct your attention to Pin Kaow on Eastern Avenue, which we started visiting recently. Their customer service is outstanding. The hostess is constantly attentive to the dining customer's needs. You should take some lessons from her.  June 2015  Hello Mr Ladeki: Hello Mr Anthony Kulick, Hello Ms Joanna Train,  It is again very unfortunate that we were sadly subjected to a disappointing dining experience as a result of the mismanagement and lack of training of your service personnel. My email with similar concerns which I had sent last year was apparently ignored by your executive team as my family and I have noticed no discernible difference in the quality of your service. This is not to say that the wait staff is in any way rude or unfriendly. They are polite and cordial, but they are at a distinct disadvantage if they are not trained properly and therefore robbed of the opportunity to sell more product, generate more revenue, and earn more gratuities.  How can it be that on a Sunday around 5:15pm, when the Green Valley restaurant is at my best estimate one third full, when there are at least 8 or 9 servers all running in different directions including past our table MULTIPLE times, when there is one very clueless onsite manager running all around, and within the entire 15 minutes after being seated and reading menus, that NO ONE, NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON, can take responsibility and assume the duty and obligation to greet us at the table and assure us that our server will be with us shortly? Within those 15 minutes, NO ONE even asked us if we wanted water on a day where the temperature outside was 108 degrees!! I am sure that your very inattentive wait staff was very, very busy doing other things in preparation for the evening crowd, but this lack of a simple greeting is unacceptable.  I know 15 minutes is not a long time in the scheme of world events. But some patrons know what they want when they sit down. At the very least, they know what they would like to drink. Perhaps you should convert the restaurant into a self-serve establishment and eliminate the need for staff and a clueless onsite manager.  Please do not offer your phone number to \"discuss my concerns.\" I do not care to be offered any special treatment because I raise these issues. When I walk into a restaurant and have minimal expectations, I expect them to be met without having to write a long-winded Yelp post. Certainly I have better things to do with my time than to bring these deficiencies to your attention.   We left Sammy's and wandered over to the Black Mountain Grill, where we were greeted by the server within 60 seconds of being seated. What a world of difference!  Perhaps you should visit Black Mountain Grill yourself and observe their operations.",

I really like their pinot selections which are not usually offered by the glass.   They offer pizzas with whole wheat or thin crust. If you ask, they will thin out the wheat crust for you too-my favorite. They also let you add or change toppings. I love to take a great veggie pizza and add some pepperoni.   Don't forget dessert!

    "text": "Our Sunday brunch at Sammy's  was easily one of my favorite dining experiences that I have had in a while. I can't believe I have not experienced this spot sooner. I LOVED how many vegetarian and vegan options they offered. This restaurant is so accommodating with dietary restrictions. **bonus points** Everything was absolutely fabulous. The food, the service, and the vibes.  I would love to start the review by mentioning how beautiful the restaurant is. It's so airy and bright, surrounded with glass doors that have nothing but beautiful greenery all around the outside. My husband even made a comment that he thought it was a great spot to start bringing clients. I felt as if I was at a resort type restaurant. Such a beautiful beautiful space!  The service was fantastic. Ricardo waited on us and he was so helpful, friendly, full of suggestions, and incredibly attentive. I loved how well he knew the menu and how willing he was to guide us through it as we made our selection.  THE FOOD! My favorite favorite part!  My husband ordered the chicken wings while I started with the hummus sampler platter. My husband loved the wings and platter was divine. I will get it every time I visit Sammy's from here on out!  We followed our small plates with a Greek salad. YALL. Sammy's does Greek salad right! It was piled high, tossed in the most scrumptious dressing, with an abundance of veggies and feta cheese. I can easily say they have the most impressive Greek salad I've ever seen and tasted. SO DELICIOUS.  We finished our salad and moved on to pizzas.  Once we took our first bite, we immediately knew we had found our new favorite pizza spot! The crust was so unbelievably perfect. The exact way we love our pizza. Not too doughy, the perfect amount of crisp, and ohhhhh the magnificent sauce.  We ordered the bbq chicken pizza and the Tuscan.  I don't eat meat, but I can assure you I know it was good just by watching my husband savor each and every bite.  I do have to say, I believe the Tuscan was the show stopper. Topped with Roma tomato's, mushrooms, red onion, and Gorgonzola It made for the most unbelievably delicious pizza. In fact, I've been planning my trip back just so I can indulge in the delicious delicious wood fired Tuscan pizza.   We finished with the flourless chocolate cake which was a deliciously decadent way to end our dining experience. I'm so happy we were informed of Sammy's incredible happy hour with 1/2 off small plates! We WILL be back. Again and again.   PRO TIP: order the espresso martini! It's a divine secret menu cocktail!",

We had great service and most of our food was good, all except for my husband's lamb chops... they were burnt to shit. Everything on his plate was torched, even all his vegetables. The waiter made up for it by giving us free dessert though, which was amazing. If you come here, try the messy sundae!",

Super fun and light space with an amazing staff.  Newer staff members behind the bar are Brandon and Dion and they'll take super good care of you!  Also, it's good to see Rachel back behind the bar again!  Like seeing an old friend when you go out.  The Starters (appetizers) are all half price from 3 to 6 and you get drink specials as well as discounts on your wine.  Wine Wednesday is a super good bet for wine lovers as bottles of wine are half-off!!  Can't beat that!!  Casual, fun, great people, and you can save a little money, too!!",

The gaming partition is completely separate with a separate entrance (only a shared bathroom). On entering the main restaurant, to the left is a more traditional dining area. To the right is an airier, more casual dining area, with some couches and some tables, with lots more light. We've come for HH and had the chicken lettuce cups (excellent!!), baba ghanoush, hummus, and dip sampler. Not disappointed with any of them. The pizza is thin crust. Quite good. This last visit I had the shrimp angel hair pasta. It has roasted mushrooms and artichoke. I asked for light lobster cream sauce - they made it perfectly. And as usual, service was excellent.",

If you've seen Cheers, the gaming bar is precisely that type of atmosphere. Everyone knows your name, your story, and you know theirs. If you're looking for a place to be a regular, this is the place.   Jamie and Chris are THE people that put all of us regulars together and created a strong sense of community. Jamie works Friday through Monday nights, Chris works Tuesday through Thursday nights. COME. THESE. NIGHTS. I, Jamie and Chris, and all the other regulars will welcome you with open arms. I'm writing this as I am currently bonding with the rest of the crew and Jamie. He is immensely professional, all the while making you feel at home. Having an amazing relationship with guests is key and both of them blend that immaculately with professionalism.  We were raving about the great promotions Sammy's has had in the past, and management informed us that Jamie was actually the one who came up with many of the ones we were raving about! I work in Corporate Marketing for Caesars Entertainment and part of my job is to create promotions to keep our guests coming and generate revenue. My executives and I (who I introduced to Sammy's and love it as well!) agree that we would LOVE to have Jamie on our team, THAT'S how good he is. Chris is just as exceptional, and all of us regulars agree that we would follow both of them anywhere. My parents introduced me to Sammy's 4 years ago around their grand opening (they are as much of regulars as it gets and visit Jamie and Chris at least 3 times a week) and this is where I happily spent my 21st birthday week two years ago with both of them. They're like my big brothers!  Thank you for all the amazing memories you give us each and every visit, J & C. YOU are the True epitome of service at its finest. Cheers to the many years to come!

    "text": "To be fair, this was our second time dining at the upgraded version of Sammy's on Green Valley Parkway and we will NOT BE RETURNING.  The breakfasts consist of the same Sysco-type food that every other restaurant in Henderson (and Vegas for that matter)  have to offer.  The same frozen potatoes with peppers, small eggs from GMO fed farms (organic cage-free doesn't mean gmo free) and grossly processed meat.  So save a few bucks and just dine at the Grand Cafe up the street for the same low quality.  What ever you do, don't order your eggs scrambled - it's nasty.   Not sure what mix or cream they used, but it was like eating yellow creamy foam.  Never again.  I will drive the extra miles just to get the best breakfast on earth at EAT downtown.  For a place that boasts \"gluten-free\" options, I was stunned that they didn't even offer gluten free bread for breakfast.  Their juice drinks at $4+ a clip aren't even fresh - rather they are poured from a bottle and/or the equivalent to drinking a Coke.    Cheap ingredients and originality is very low.  The pizzas could have been frozen for all I knew.  Bland and no flavor.   If you like matzo crackers, then the artisan pizzas are for you.  The salads were wilted and over poured with dressing.  During BOTH visits, the staff refused to give me box for our pizza!  They offered to \"box\" it, yet BOTH times they ruined two left over pizzas  by wrapping them securely  in aluminum foil!   Who does this?   Do they think  the toppings won't stick to the foil?  Or maybe that people with a nice car don't want food leaking???  When I asked for a \"box\", I was told, \"we don't give out boxes\".  Mind you, they give boxes for take out, but if you buy two of the most expensive pizzas and only eat half, you get foil.  I told her that I would pay for a box and so the waitress returned with a plastic container that was clearly too small for the pizza and said \"will this do\"? Then she walked away in a huff.   The two California investors for this restaurant standing by did nothing.  It is my hope that the CA investors who are constantly on the floor and yet strangely never  interact with patrons, will bring in a few experienced servers from California to demonstrate to Las Vegas waitstaff how the job should be done.  This \"i will probably only ever serve you once\" mentality is best left for Las Vegas Blvd.",

After we were finally seated, it took over an hour for our food to arrive.

Get it together or you won't survive the Vegas local's service expectations.",

My latest visit was at the bar in the gaming area and I had the shrimp/crab dip & the red quinoa salad (from the regular menu). I was pleased that the bartender gave me both the happy hour menu and the regular menu WITHOUT MY HAVING TO ASK for the happy hour menu! Kudos. I was impressed with how cozy the bar area is. The white lights around the bar really make the place comfy. The bar chairs, not so much.  Back to the food- the shrimp/crab dip was disappointing. If you're gonna feature crab, I better be able to taste it! Not so much here. It was served hot and with plenty of flatbread but the flavor just wasn't there. The salad was excellent and very fresh. Loved the beets & avacado,  Would have again for sure and maybe try some tapas from the happy hour menu next time. They have gaming promos such as earn 250 points on Mondays get $20 play next visit.",

Very unique since the sauce held the glass to the serving plate as well as lined the inside of the glass and was layered over the ice cream.  Yes indeed, will return.  I saw some recent one and two star reviews concerning poor service. Hopefully those situations are major flukes otherwise I'd go somewhere else too.",

    "text": "Ooh this place in the Green Valley hood is open 24/7! That was the first thing I noticed when I read the 411 about  the new Sammy's restaurant. Because when I have 3am cravings for duck tacos or I want a dessert for breakast(which is the very first thing I did on my official visit here <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#6toCyEXOe6hYjLnFocaugw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/samm...</a>) I know very well where to go now!    Yes I have dined here 4 times already! Had fun trying out the Brie French toast during the mock breakfast. Had a blast when they hosted the Yelp Elite Event ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/elite-event-yelps-red-carpet-affair-sammys-henderson#hrid:n04td4eR6icK6Zxru0ZlCQ\">yelp.com/biz/elite-event...</a> ) and been back twice now since they officially opened.  It's safe to say I'm a fan.   The standouts for me are their tapas and dessert offerings. The tapas menu is pretty unique and has an international flair.  There's Asian and Mediterranean cuisine thrown in as well...or should I say fused together..IE their Duck Tacos! Mini taco shells filled with shredded duck,creamy feta cheese and cilantro. They surprisingly pulled off the combo of ingredients. The Hot Rock is another tapas dish and must try. The beef is presented to you raw  marinated in ponzu sauce. You have to grill it yourself on a super HOT rock that is on top salt rock crystals which keeps the rock heated. I only wish they would give you a little more slices of beef for the amount you pay for this dish.    For desserts, the Sticky Toffee Pudding is wicked good! Sweet moist cake served over a warm toffee sauce that eventually soaks thru. It's paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance the sweet stuff.  Yeah those evil sweets, so best have dessert in the morning so you have all day to burn those calories off! That doesn't help though I was back later for dinner and shared the Messy Sundae with Mr. B.  Caramel and Chocolate sauce, walnuts, whip cream all over the place ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sammys-restaurant-bar-and-grill-henderson?selected=nd2mtwNWS3VTUtSsgh3esw#l1e1s-4NV_6JNx6gDOgvHg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/samm...</a>) ..need I say more?   I also appreciate the focus is on healthy, fresh and organic, like the eggs for the omelet I had were cage free. Yummy Vegetarian, Vegan and Gluten free dishes are also served.  Adding their Baba Ghanoush to my #Meatless Monday rotation.  Atmosphere ..love it! Casual cool and inviting.  The livingroom-like dining area on the right side is the place to be! Its another huge factor that plays into this place for being one of the designated neighborhood places to dine. Its open and airy,  natural lighting during the day. Love the wicker furnishings it didn't feel cramped at all, the floor to ceiling glass were actually doors that slide open and voila!! It converts to a patio! When its not windy they have it opened up. I'm all about dining  al fresco!  The small negatives -  Breakfast was just okay. I did like what I had though. I think the price point for what you get is just a tad much. I'm guessing maybe because the demographic makeup of this area they mainly cater to can afford it. This place for sure is not your \"I come here to-get-my-daily -breakfast-burrito- place. Oh and steak and fries $25? That's a bit much too. Other than that, there's enough dishes well worth it.    Service has been great! They are well staffed in all the areas. There was a little wait time to be seated but it was crowded at the entrance.  NOTE: They do take reservations and the manager I talked to also said OpenTable will be implemented soon.  So I highly advise you make reservations especially for dinner time hours.    Well those are the deets! I'm sure Ill have more foodporn pix pop up soon enough since you'll find me here often! Welcome to the neighborhood Sammys!",

    "text": "What can I say about Sammy's that hasn't already been said?   The food is terrific! It's always such a treat to see a whole wheat crust pizza option. The salad portions are huge. Seriously, huge. My only wish for them is that there'd be a smaller/cheaper salad option that I could add on to my meal.   I just love the ambience of this restaurant. It's modern but comfortable. Little to no area to hang out, though, while you wait to be seated... That awkward moment when you're standing half inside/half outside unable to close the door as you wait to be greeted by the hostess.   The service was incredible. They accidentally made my pizza with a regular crust instead of the wheat that I'd ordered. They quickly brought me the correct pizza despite saying I'd just stick with the wrong one and took it off the bill to make up for my \"troubles\". That is seriously the way to retain loyal customers! Kudos, Sammy's.   Can't wait to go back and try some of the tapas from the half off menu at happy hour!",

My husband and I have dined here often and knew it would be a good place to have a small gathering for the graduation dinner and I was so happy we did.  Thank goodness for the manager Erin, she was very helpful in planning our menu, then when I can hang the graduation decorations, she volunteered to do it for me and everything else. She was a God send!!! After the graduation we arrived for the gathering and the private room looked amazing and she already had salads, bread and waters all on the table. Plus she decorated the room and looked great.  Then the food started to come out so delicious and the waitress we had, she was great too. The overall experience was fantastic! Thank you Erin for making the celebration so seamless!",

    "text": "Went to Sammy's yesterday to celebrate a special birthday but ended up leaving with the worst experience.  The birthday girl wanted to do bottomless mimosas so we decided to check out Sammys.  A group of 12 (included 2 kids) arrived at the restaurant. The restaurant was almost empty and when we told them how many they asked if we had a reservation. Once we said no, you could tell they were pissed by their tone and posture (keep in mind the restaurant was almost empty)  Once seated we waited 15 minutes without menus or somebody to take our drink orders. After ordering and eating, the server (bartender) brought over the check. We ask him if he could separate the check as most restaurants will do it for you and if they don't they will tell you before you order that they are unable to  After we asked he said that we could not break for parties of 12 or more but could use different payments.( this is something he should of told us when we ordered) The multiple payments were fine and we provided him a couple of cards and told him which food to bill on each card. He then responded and said we need to tell them how our meals cost ( never have I been somewhere where they made the customer add up their meals) He then walked away and gave the receipt to someone else  A woman came to our table (assuming she was a manager who knows) and just said we can't break up the check. There was no introduction of who she was or or apologized for the inconvenience. She had no customer service nor portray herself as a manager.   Instead of leaving the restaurant happy and enjoying a celebration, everybody was irritated with the service that this restaurant provided. Next time we will definitely hit somewhere else",

    "text": "Dropped in here (aka \"Sammy's Woodfired Pizza & Grill\") when I was struck with an Italio-carb craving ... and remembered an acquaintance has given this venue the thumbs-up.  This restaurant venue is nicely appointed, far more so that I would have expected out of knowing this is a 24/7 VP bar at its core. Truth be told, I never even discovered the gaming area! Continuous floor-to-ceiling windows run three sides of the large, main dining space. I arrived around 6pm on a weekday and the entire space was packed solid. Including a ten-top in the back corner.   Yes, the menu is mostly about the 'za, but there some pasta plates and sandwiches and such. Many of the items are twisted, such as kung-pao calamari, making for a very interesting treat to the palate. I went with grilled Brussels sprouts (w balsamic & nuts) appy at $9.00, then a 14\" sausage & onion pizza at $13.75, washed down with an iced tea at $3.25.     The Brussels sprouts were very tasty. OK, YOU don't like Brussels sprouts, but I love them. Especially in this grilled format that's turned up on a number of menus in recent years. A tasty alternative to fronting with a traditional salad, also at $9.00. The pizza was fine, nothing in the range of \"I gotta message all my BFFs and tell 'em right now,\" but tasty. My mistake here was to not step into this venue's twisted world and try something like their Pad Thai pizza.   Then I lucked into a Yelp check-in for a free desert they call a Messy Sundae. I recommend it. And I do NOT recommend it.   OK, it's really a traditional sundae, you know, vanilla ice cream, choco syrup, some nuts, whipped cream, a Maraschino on top. But this place got really creative and turned it into one stupendous presentation. It's served in a wine glass that's been sitting in the freezer ... and that is set upon a small dinner plate. Instead of putting the choco syrup into the glass, on top of the ice cream, they run it (and the nuts) down the sides of the frozen glass until the plate is puddled in it. Then you can dip your ice cream into the puddle. Then a glorious tall cone of whipped cream protrudes from the glass. I am sure there's pictures of it here; check 'em out. That's why I recommend it.   Here's why I DON'T recommend it. It is absolutely impossible to eat it neatly. Impossible. I bibbed my lap with an extra napkin ... and still, as I write this, my khakis are soaking in detergent in my washing machine, hoping to get all the choco droplets out of them. These folks WANT it to be messy, that's plain enough, because the give you a long and teeny-weeny spoon to try to eat it with. So no way your choco-spoon ain't gonna runneth over with every mouthful. And you've got to dig deep in that unsteady wine glass to get your ice cream out. And you'll probably be trying to scrape the nuts and choco off the sides of that glass as well. Grab the glass to steady it ... wah-wah, the glass is coated with syrup. It LOOKS awesome, but you'll earn a gold medal trying to eat it like an adult. I didn't take home the gold ... and once was enough for me. Though my shot at glory was free, you'll pay a $10 entry fee to compete.   My recommended play here is to come in between 3pm & 6pm, when all the apps are half-off. There were at least twenty of them on the menu. Everything from the aforementioned calamari and the Brussels sprouts ... to meatballs, poke, tacos, potstickers, pork dumplings et. al. At half-off, most of them can be snagged at $4.50 to $6.00 each. Four of them would easily make a quite filling four-way-twisted light dinner for two. A much better alternative than racking up a $50 tab in exchange for two personal-sized pizzas fronted by a teaser or two plus beverages.  There's several branches of Sammy's scattered about town, including one inside McCarran. Just more evidence Sammy's is a solid choice.  This unit is just off 215 at Green Valley, at the GV & Pebble intersection, across the street from the strip mall that houses a Smith's and Bank of America & Wells Fargo outparcels.",

Christian is a wonderful bartender who really takes care of his customers. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there seems to be a revolving door of servers. There are a few consistent servers but being a weekly patron, I wish I would see more consistent friendly faces.",

Decor and Vibe  This was a very cool \"mature\" version of Sammy's which I am used to living in California. They had these great open windows that actually slide open to open up to the outside so the entire restaurant became almost a patio. Beautiful decor, with very cool fire pits for groups.   Food  Loved how many healthy options were on the menu. My wife is super picky and gluten free. We shared a Mediterranean plate, a balsamic chicken salad and Mahi Tacos.. all around deliciousness.    Service   The server was very helpful and gave us great information for their $10 lunch special that we couldn't do because we were there later than the timeframe, but it sounded great.  Parting Thoughts  This is a great spot to bring a business meeting, an event, a date.. definitely sophisticated and affordable. Wish they had one of these in San Diego!",

    "text": "TWO STARS is all you get. Reason being I am glad this location was not taken over by a pawn shop, happy ending spa or a needle exchange and also because the food is decent. I repeat. The food is decent.   My big beef with this restaurant is the service. When I say service I mean the Management.   I have been to Sammy's on three separate occasions. First time with a fellow Yelper for brunch and I had the breakfast tacos which were good. Not great, but good. Service was on point.  Second visit was at lunch time on a Sunday with my mother. It took our waitress 25 minutes to get us our drinks. I realize how long it takes to get water and how difficult it is. What was even more annoying than our waitress was the fact that they let the patrons who were sitting at the nice bar in the center of the restaurant scream at the TV during the football game. They were tossing back $10 bottomless Mimosas and obnoxiously reacting to every play and startling all of the dining customers who most of them appeared to have just come from church. Not cool especially because this restaurant has a side sports bar where they should have been directed to. Not cool especially because the Managers did nothing at all about it. The Managers stood by the bar and watched the game the entire time, too! Not my idea for a relaxing Sunday brunch. If I wanted this ruckus I would have gone to the sports book!  Third visit I really disliked a pasta dish I was sharing. Took one bite and no more. I mentioned it to the waitress and was still charged for it. Way to keep it classy, Sammy's.   NOT ONCE IN ANY OF MY VISITS DID THE MANAGERS TOUCH ANY TABLES TO SEE IF THE GUESTS WERE HAPPY WITH THEIR FOOD AND SERVICE.  Lastly, I did not want to write this review.It's my favorite time of year when I pretty much love everyone and everything.  I shared my frustration with their website directly. But, when 2 MONTHS later I did not receive anything more than a generated email response from the Sammy's website I knew I had to let the Yelp family know. I will not be playing it again, Sam I am.",

Markus, the Monday through Friday bartender is truly genuine and probably helps makes the \"regulars\". He knows his drinks. It would be nice to see the menu change with the season. One last thought... Beware of the shishito peppers; although mild at times (still cooked to perfection) you may get a plate of hot ones! Luckily the amazing peanut based dipping sauce is close at hand to help relieve the mouth. On a side note, the sauce served with the shishito peppers is amazing for dipping their calamari, and pretty much any other vegetable.",

It was very calming with all the light woods and fake water tanks. Our server was very prompt and brought us our drinks. I really loved the menu. I'd go back just for the tapas. They all sounded very yummy. We picked the Duck tacos to start with and I got the Shrimp pasta and Joel got the New York style pizza. Wow! The Duck tacos! Yuuuuummmmy! I could have just eaten like 20 of these little bite size tacos. You do get 6 tacos ( I was forced to share with Joel. Hehe) they are filled with grilled duck, a creamy avocado and cilantro sour cream, queso fresco, and bits of tomato and fresh cilantro. Really! What a treat that was. My Shrimp pasta was also so yummy! (I love that I had the choice of whole wheat pasta.) My dish contained huge shrimp, zucchini, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and it was all mixed with a light and creamy lobster sauce. I was in heaven! The $19 it cost was so totally worth every penny! Joel's pizza had mushrooms, pepperoni, salami, and Italian sausage with a red sauce. The sauce was full of flavor and Joel loved all the meat that was on it.   Other then our waitress not noticing the gift certificate and charging our card full price it was a great experience. ( she felt really bad that she messed up) The decor is great, the atmosphere relaxing and the food was on point. It is a bit pricey, but with the level of food they have it's justified. Can't wait to go back and try more of their tapas.",

Sahara location multiple times and it is never a disappointment. I love their Pear & Gorgonzola pizza along with the others, BBQ, Margarita. My favorite app is the Duck Tacos (not to be confused with the duck quesadilla, not a fan). And who doesn't love the Messy Sundae?   This location is great, huge open floor plan, bar right in the middle, but my favorite thing about this location is the wall facing Green Valley Pkwy opens up and exposes the entire restaurant to fresh air. I love it! This is definitely a great addition to the GV area. Can't wait to come and try brunch. This place is pretty decent when it comes to chain restaurants.",

    "text": "Went here on Wednesday and was happy to find out they have wine Wednesdays. Half off all bottles! I was in the mood for some small plate options and this had some interesting things on the menu. My husband and I started with three which would have been enough but decide to squeeze in one more. Duck Tacos-Great sauce but meat could have had more flavor.  Meditarnian dipping plate-Terrific! Fresh pitas, great hummus and the cheese and sesame so very good.  Pork dumplings - decent with a little crunch which was nice.  Coconut shrimp with orange/horshradish dipping sauce-Amazing! The best thing we had. They should bottle that sauce.  Over all the atmosphere was very nice with comfortable seating, dim lights. Our server was terrific (I think her name was Adriana?). Service was quick, attentive and our wine was very good.  The only reasons it didn't get 5 stars was: A) The host was slow greeting us at the door. It would have been nice if the servers or bartenders at least greeted us as they past and let us know someone was coming soon. B) It was just a little pricey for the food. Not too bad, just a little over what it should be I think.  We will be back on Wednesdays for sure!",

I love their patio dining atmosphere... open, airy and just all around fun... like being in someone's solarium.  The groupings of tables and \"booths\" which are overstuffed chairs/couches is really nice.  I'm thinking this would be a nice place for happy hour... not dark and closed in like some places... this is light and open.    Their salads are big enough to share. Their Mediterranean appetizer trio is awesome... love it!   The chicken lettuce wraps are filling if you happen to get them as an entree like I did. Well... ok... so I was full after eating most of the appetizer and then my lettuce wraps.  Next time.... if I go with my mom again... we'll order 1 salad and 1 Med appetizer and that will do us just fine.  Note... don't order a Bellini... they don't make it with peach puree or peach juice... it just came out as sparkling wine.  This was a miss.",

    "text": "Quick look: quality and affordable comfort food. Specialty is gourmet wood oven pizzas and massive salads. Very comfortable, open air room - if you can figure out how to get to the front door!   In depth review: very familiar with this Vegas Valley chain and decided to try it out on a Monday night. After a few minutes of navigation through the adjacent business park trying to figure out how to find Sammy's parking lot and entrance, we walked in and were surprised at how busy it was. Bar had a good crowd for MNF. After waiting a couple minutes we were seated at a large table / booth towards the front (facing Green Valley Parkway). It was a chilly Monday night and they did have one of the sliding glass walls open. I enjoyed the fresh air but my lady was cold (as usual). So bring a sweater or jacket if you go in Fall / Winter season at night.   Service was prompt. Our waiter was still trying to master the little touch screen they use to take orders. He suggested a flatbread appetizer that comes with three different Hummus style dipping sauces. So we ordered that along with a margarita pizza and a grilled shrimp salad. Explained to him that we wanted the pizza and the salad brought out together as our entrees and that we would split them. So we wait about 25 minutes (too long) and finally our flat bread and dip came out to munch on as an appetizer. As soon as I reach for it another runner arrives with our entrees in hand. Was not too pleased and explained that we just got our appetizer and please take the entrees back. For some reason many quality places in Vegas have this issue with timing and seem to want to turn tables as fast as they can?!  Waiter comes back and apologizes. Blames it on the kitchen (obviously). Either way, we enjoy the appetizer and the entrees come out later. They were great. The salad was massive and could easily feed 2 - 3 people. The pizza was cooked perfect and blew similar style at a CPK or Settebello out of the water!   We were too full for desert but I could see the tables around us ordering them and they looked delicious. Actually they looked massive and could easily be shared.   Really not going to hold the issue with timing against them. They are a new spot and obviously need to work out some kinks in their operation. Our waiter was super polite and we think he will be just fine as soon as he masters that touch pad. He did comp the appetizer and our drinks. Manager never came to table to apologize but we are sure he signed off on the comp. Also did not get a good night when we walked out and past the hostess - but thats OK.   We will be back. It's a really nice casual spot and very reasonably priced for the amount of food they give you. Great location and it should do just fine.",

The machines play rather well considering how low most places have them set. Excellent place to meet friends, eat dinner, play some machines or just hide out from the horrible over bearing GV drivers for a while!   Before you take \"certain\" bad reviews to heart and bypass Sammy's, click on the reviewers name and see if they appear to take great pleasure in slamming 99% of the places they visit. Good scam for getting comps and freebies while misleading people into not trying certain places, such as this great establishment for instance!",

They have a wonderful bar area next to a full glass window wall that opens up, the fresh air is great reminds me of California style restaurants.  Appetizers : Asian style calamari ( very unique) I highly suggest this.  Hot Rock: 600 degree rock in a bed of salt, and you get to cook your own beef on it. Very tasty and interesting. Also we had Vietnamese crab stack. That was really good and fresh with real crab, and a little lemon grass ginger flavor.  Had a glass of Pinot and the shrimp and grits . Very good, not something I would ever order, I was being spontaneous that day. The waiter suggested it and it was a GREAT suggestion.The grits are not like grits at all, not a single gritty grain actually. Made very well with a stack of steamed greens.  Our waiter was very nice. His name was Zack. Its rare you find people who actually enjoy their job. There is nothing that makes your food taste worst than a fake good mood. We certainly didn't get it with this guy. He is much appreciated, and made my birthday great.  I love the new location, and will be back regularly.",

The food is great, just an awful lack of service that doesn't match the the dollar signs here. We were seated to our table and waited 7mins until we were greeted and once we told our server our beverage order, she disappeared for another 4mins to grab our waters and my boyfriend's tall Blue Moon. Then, although we were beyond ready to order our food, she disappeared for another  5mins. We were really hungry and really impatient at that point. We felt bad but we just grabbed our drinks and made our way to the bar, as she was taking way too long. The table next to us even noticed our irritation, as they sat there with the same irritation because they had been sitting for a while without service too. As we got up and moved ourselves to the bar, that table next us got up and left the establishment. We obviously told the bartender why we moved and he apologized but hardly had any urgency and the manager was even right there and she didn't even care! It was a rather lengthy late night dinner and we're definitely disappointed, as we always are when we leave Sammy's. Can't come here when I'm in a hurry that's for sure. Guess I'll stick with California Pizza Kitchen for similar menu items and much better service. Doesn't ever get any better at Sammy's unfortunately.",

We noticed that no one ever sat at those booths & now there were 2 more booths available so we asked again for a booth & were sat at a booth. Twenty minutes later our food came & was on its way back to the kitchen since our original table was empty & they thought we left the restaurant. We flagged them down & complained to the manager that our drinks were still not out. She made a face & said she'll check on it. The food was good & the waiter added a free dessert but disappeared again & after waiting for 15 minutes for him to pick up our payment, I walked over to the kitchen and handed him my credit card. Worst Service Ever in a restaurant which was mildly busy. I called the restaurant 25 minutes later & was extremely disappointed AGAIN...  Horrible Customer Service! We left the restaurant angry because of the terrible service on Father's Day & forgot our left over to go bag on the table. Less than 30 minutes later I called the restaurant & the hostess tells me they tossed the bag because no one ever comes back for pick up after they leave the place.  We eat out a lot as a family & these guys have the worst customer practices of anything I've experienced so far in Henderson, Nevada.",

    "text": "Just got done with my second visit to Sammy's this time during happy hour with my homegirl (her first time). I love the ambiance of this restaurant; the openness of the atrium room is really inviting and more importantly- they play good, hip music.   During Happy Hour, the mixed drinks are 50% off with majority of the drinks being around $12. The wine is $2 off and beer $1 off. Happy Hour runs from 3-6p, 7 days a week- not too shabby. Also, the appetizers are on sale!m during Happy Hour.   My friend ordered the mini duck tacos, which she said were fantastic. The duck has great texture and the veggies sprinkled on top were nice and fresh. For her main course she tried the Wagyu Mini Sliders. These came with the lettuce/tomatoes and onions on the side with a huge side of crispy fries. The Wagyu Sliders were nice and juice +the cheddar slice on top- perfect!   Tonight I tried the Shrimp Angel Pasta. The lobster cream sauce atop this is so creamy and delicious. It also comes with artichokes, mushrooms and zucchini slices. Not too heavy, yet filling!   As much as I want to give 5 Stars, unfortunately there was a mix up in the kitchen and our food took longer than expected. Two other tables nearby (which walked in after us) revived there food way before us. Also, I would liked our server to check in on us more than what we experienced tonight.   Other than that, I liked how the manager remembered me from my Yelp Elite Week experience from two weeks ago! He walked up and said, \"your back!\" That's cool he remembered me!",

Both my friend and I are pretty challenged when it comes to making menu decisions. Sammy's has so many awesome menu options it can make it even harder to decide. However our waiter was super helpful and patient with us.   We ended up getting the poke and hot rock steak appetizer, the burratta and heirloom tomato salad, tequila lime chicken fettuccine, pear and prosciutto pizza and lastly the sticky toffee pudding dessert. Every dish was delicious! Definitely can't wait to come back!",

They have a good assortment to choose from - pizza, soups, salads, pastas, a good assortment of finger foods and deserts.  They also have a kids menu.  This location is always clean and the staff is always friendly and courteous.  There is plenty of parking behind he building.  We started off with garlic cheese bread.  Like a cheese and garlic pizza without the sauce.  An Asian sampler - skewers of grilled shrimp, a couple pot stickers with dipping sauce, and a couple skewers of satay chicken in a peanut sauce.  Followed by a mozzarella cheese and pepperoni pizza.  Ended with a Messy Sunday!  We were lucky enough to get Raychelle as our server, so was had a great time!  Definitely a place to go back again and again!",

I ordered a personal pizza , I don't eat cheese so I ordered a Sicilian without the cheese and onion. I very much enjoyed the pizza. It had lots of pepperoni, sausage, peppers and sans onion. The crust was chewy and crispy at the same time. The whole pizza in general was crispy. I'm assuming because I had no cheese. The bf pizza was a little soggy but still great flavor. The server picked up on the fact I don't dairy and was kind enough to let me know the sauce has cheese so she was able to switch it to marinara. Great service, great food, giant beers. Awesome!",

It has both the normal restaurant area, as well as a 24/7 tavern, gaming area. Service is attentive and friendly in both areas. And hey, I hit 4-of-a-kind twice here, so that's pretty awesome. Happy hour is 4-6pm and has multiple small appetizers and drinks on special. The apps are smaller portions than the regular apps, so you aren't exactly saving a bunch of money. But it is nice in that it allows you to try out multiple apps, as opposed to getting full on just one. All of the food I've had here has been great. I love their goat cheese pizza. And the mac 'n' cheese is fab. I wish they still had the kobe beef hummus, but the regular hummus is still tasty. The meatballs are pretty good too.

So when my sweet friend Jaime W. asked if she could take me here for brunch to celebrate my birthday I was stoked to check out the place so many of my Yelp friends had raved about.   This is a gorgeous restaurant! I loved the beautiful decor...  It felt like we were dining on an island somewhere. I was also excited to see that a friend was being trained as a waitress while we were there... Sometimes it can be annoying to get a trainee as your waiter or waitress, but I enjoyed getting to see a familiar face (and she didn't make any major mistakes while serving us).   As beautiful as the interior of Sammy's is, there were a few things that needed some work. I originally wanted one of the special 'handcrafted juice refreshers'  but they were unavailable. So I decided to get a mimosa, we were celebrating my birthday after all. Mimosas are listed as $8 on the menu with a $10 all-you-can-drink advertised as a Sunday special... but somehow, my single mimosa was $10.   The highlight of the meal, for me, was the adorable little donuts that we started with. They were served with chocolate and raspberry sauces and were super delicious.  The breakfast burrito I got was large, but just ok taste-wise.   Sammy's staff was generous enough to give me a free dessert for my birthday, the Messy Sundae. It  was rather cool looking but uninspired in terms of flavor and very  difficult to eat.  Overall, I enjoyed my initial visit to Sammy's enough to want to go back sometime. Hopefully some of the kinks will have been worked out by the time I do so!",

    "text": "My friend Sarah Jane invited me to the Sammy's elite event as her plus 1, but when she wasn't able to make it. She somehow got me invited with a plus 1 to the Sammy's VIP event a few nights later. I love that girl!  This was a complete success from start to finish. They executed this event perfectly. I was greeted at the door and she easily found my name. My friend wasn't there yet, so she wrote her name next to mine and assured me she would have no issues getting in.   As I walked in I was greeted by more people, one offered me a glass of champagne. I went to the bar and almost immediately someone came up to me to offer a slice of pizza. The flow of the food was perfectly timed. It seemed just as I would finish one thing someone else was offering me a new item. Pretty much every thing I tried was delicious. The pizzas were great. My two absolute favorites were the Goat Cheese (Sauteed mushrooms, garlic spinach and red onion - which I took off) and Five Cheese (Gouda, Raclette, Romano, Mozzarella, and Gorgonzola - perfect). The Garlic chicken was my least favorite, although I did like the BBQ Chicken (Smoked Gouda, BBQ Sauce, Cilantro - I removed the ren onion, of course)  The duck tacos were great. I really liked the tomato/cilantro sauce. Duck is definitely one of my most under eaten but favorite meats. I love when a restaurant isn't afraid to use it. They also had a duck quesadilla that was pretty delicious. I was in duck heaven.   Some other yummy things that I tried: Some kind of tuna on a cracker - perfect and some kind of fish tacos. Both were good, but I really liked the tuna. The specialty cracker (it didn't really taste like a regular cracker) paired perfectly with the tuna. I could have eaten 100 of those. So good!!  One of the only things I didn't like too much was the hummus. I'm not sure exactly what about it. Maybe I was just stuffed as it was one of the last things I tried, but I think I just didn't like it.   Even the house red wine they were serving was pretty good. I tried a few of the specialty cocktails and although they were good. I'm not a cocktail girl.  Everyone was so friendly. Great customer service. We sat at the bar the majority of the night and even though the staff seemed very busy they were attentive. The venue is awesome. Large bar right in the middle. There's an atrium style room to one side with large windows. There's also going to be a tavern open 24/7 linked to the restaurant.   I can't wait to come back on Thursday for ladies night. Ladies drink 2 for 1 8pm to 12am and also to try the mac and cheese, made with Tillamook Cheddar, my favorite!",

And place a order for hummus some guy not my waiter brings it out quickly enough. But my server took another 13min to come back and ask if we wanted anything to eat by this time I ask for the check. He than say \"oh wow so soon ok\" in a smart a$$ type of way. Brings my check with no pen I do not know of it was my skin color or what but seem like everyone else was getting quick servers..

Not packed, but at least half full.  Very brisk business.  I sat in the kind of half couch tables that face the bar.  VERY comfortable and unique.  Had a good view of the TV, but you have to turn your head slightly.  Service was a little spotty as the bartender was busy.  This is why I usually don't sit in the bar area at restaurants when I am dining.  However, once I ordered, my food was out very quickly.  I had the sliders with fries and added gorgonzola cheese.  Fantastic.  The bun is soft and toasty and did not fall apart.  This was particularly impressive as the burger was JUICY.  The patties are flavorful.  I could use a little more of the sauce, next time I order them I'll probably ask for more on the side.  The fries are good, thin and crispy with some nice seasoning.    Cool design and atmosphere with a comprehensive menu.  We'll definitely come back.",

My only suggestion is that Sammy's should have rice as a side dish, it would have really complimented several of the menu \"shareables\".",

I didn't plan on going back, but my wife wanted to see if we might have a better experience my second time.  We did.  She really liked the sliders and I ordered a different salad (the balsamic chicken) which was quite good.  Still seemed to be understaffed though.

I had driven by this place so many times and just never really gotten a chance to check it out until a friend recommended that I try it for happy hour.  Shared plates are half price during happy hour (they have plenty to choose from: pot stickers, satay, lettuce cups, calamari, hummus, baba ghanoush, shrimp, poke, duck tacos, meatballs, etc.) and they have specialty cocktails, wine, and beer also at a discounted price during happy hour.  They also offer pizza, burgers, salads, pastas, roasted meats and fish, and yummy desserts (warm doughnuts, anyone?).   The Green Valley space is actually quite elegant and the service is the best! Our gal Kristie took such great care of us - kept our drinks full and our bellies happy. She was a lot of fun too!   I'm so glad that I can add Sammy's to my list of local spots to enjoy. I hear they offer a fantastic weekend brunch too!",

In my opinion, Sammy's tops them all!  Too many options & too little time but here's what we had:  Crisp Brussels Sprouts. I was a little skeptical but they were charred perfectly and the glaze was great.   Tuscan Kale & Romaine Salad.  Lots of almonds & cranberries so I was happy. The sherry-Dijon dressing could be a little overpowering but we got it on the side so we could adjust to individual taste. Individual size was plenty for two.     New York Style Pizza on wheat crust.  Great pizza on the perfect crust!  Portions were generous so we more than had our fill & took home some of everything.   It is hard to top the food but the service was even better than the food.  From the time we were greeted at the door to the manager stopping by our table to make sure everything was perfect.  But our waiter, Ricardo was the best; attentive & knowledgeable and very friendly and helpful throughout our meal.  They even had cotton candy for dessert (a favorite of my wife)!  Ps. The beer was cold.  The only disappointment of the evening was the Black Knights lost 2-1 in double OT.",

I ordered a pizza with whole wheat crust, marinara, spinach, olives, onions, bell peppers, artichokes & sundried tomatoes. It was wonderful! (I would normally order the vegan cheese, but I am not a fan of Daiya)  The server was wonderful! Very knowledgeable and accommodating.   I will be back!",

The location is a short drive away from the 215 and in front of some office buildings.   For my meal I went with the Thin Crust Brie & Truffle pizza. They were offering both brunch options and lunch, but pizza just sounded right to me. The timing of our entrees was a little slow, maybe about 10 minutes from the first plate being received to the last. That was a bit disappointing, but the food was great. My pizza was hot & fresh. I loved the cracker thin crust and it had plenty of cheese.   I'm sure I'll be back at Sammy's again in the future. I'd like to try to come for a dinner next time for a little more liveliness.",

    "text": "We were in the neighborhood Sunday evening visiting some family and decided to try somewhere on this side of town for dinner before heading home. We choose Sammy's based on the reviews.  Pulling into the parking lot it seemed pretty busy. Upon entering the restaurant we were in a small line about 3 couples deep. We only had to wait about 5 minutes for them to get to us.   The guy asked if we'd like to sit near the bar. We said okay. After being seated we realized the seats were really soft. We didn't like how we were sinking down and back into them. When he was walking by a minute or two later we told him we'd decided we'd rather sit at a table. He asked us to wait a couple of minutes while he got a table ready.  A few minutes later we were moved to a table which we found much more comfortable, although the yelling kid behind us was a little annoying.  So finally seated I started checking the place out. I really liked how it looked. We perused the menu. I had decided on the Maui Tacos. It seemed we'd been there awhile. No one even came and brought us any water or asked if we'd like anything from the bar. Usually moments after you're seated someone is with you. They might not be ready to take your order yet, but they let you know they'll be right with you.  Looking around I saw 5 empty tables that needed to be cleaned up. The customers had eaten and left. I was starting to get the picture Enter the restaurant and wait to be seated. Asked to be moved...waited for that. Seated at a table no one to assist us. They were obviously short handed tonight. I really didn't want to order food and have to wait for it and then have it arrive cold because they were short handed.  At this point we decided to leave and find somewhere that we weren't getting a vibe that they were too busy to assist us promptly.  Well you know what they say you only get one chance to make a first impression, and this first impression wasn't great.   So we're giving it two stars based on this visit. If we're in the neighborhood sometime in the future we might try it again.",

This past weekend we decided to return and see if they've improved. Our service was great and we can now gladly add this back as one of our go to spots near home.   The inside of the restaurant has a beach/Florida theme. Plenty of windows allow for a bright dining room. The atmosphere is lively and a little noisy without being too loud. This would be a good spot for families since kids likely wouldn't be heard by surrounding tables.   The menu offers a great variety of food items. They have a large list of appetizers, pastas, tacos, burgers, salads, pizzas, entrees, and desserts. They offer light options as well as heartier meals.   Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. She was around checking on us frequently and made sure we had drink refills.   Chicken Lettuce Cups were a delicious starter. The mixture of chicken, hoisin sauce, and vegetables worked well together. Asian Shrimp Pasta was my choice of entree for the evening. Everything in this dish was great and the peanut sauce was very tasty. The peanut sauce did make for a very rich dish so I'm not sure I'd order this again, but it did taste great. My husband went with the Spicy Italian Sausage and said it was a good pizza.   I'm so glad to report that my recent Sammy's experience was better than the last!",

The duck was crispy but tender. Loved the flavors of the cilantro and feta added with it. It was a perfect appetizer.   Spicy Thai Grilled Chicken Salad-very delicious, but it wasn't spicy at all. I loved the fresh herbs and the perfectly grilled chicken. Just a little too many peanuts added.   Sicilian Pizza-So good! I can't believe I never ordered a pizza here before. The crust was perfectly soft and crunchy. Normally I don't eat the crust because it's either too crispy or flavorless without the sauce and cheese but this dough was delicious. I also loved their sauce. It was so fresh with a touch of spice.",

Not sure why they would even think of having the guest struggle walking let alone that distance, when we were standing next to available tables. The waitress was prompt & courteous, took the order, received drinks, food was fantastic! Than she disappeared. The rest of the meal no service was to be had. Just plan awful. Could not even get our check without tracking her down. Once we had the check she never came back to pick up the payment. For that reason it will be along time before I go back to this establishment.

We got the lentil, prosciutto, and arugula salad (not sure why it's called this because it's not a salad, deconstructed or not), the duck tacos, coconut shrimp, almonds and olives, and lobster Mac and cheese...  The duck tacos and lobster Mac were really really delicious, big hunks of real lobster and good flavor on Mac and the duck tacos were really nice and meaty and crispy. The olives and toasted marconas were really great quality too and I really liked the salad - you know, for not being a salad and all. The only misfires were the coconut shrimp and it wasn't a misfire so much as they were a little boring and a bit over cooked but we were pretty much tearing up the rest ;). The wine we ordered was turned but that happens. The weird part was the waitress seemed to anticipate a problem and almost be waiting to see if we could tell the difference. When we told her the wine was way off she acted like she figured it had gone bad, we kind of looked at each other in surprise at the table. I hate to speculate beyond that because I really loved the meal and casual atmosphere but if you get some less than yummy wine, do us all a favor and vanish it to a land far far awayyyy!!",

    "text": "A new Sammy's Restaurant in Henderson, relocated, remodeled and revamped!  The biggest difference is the location, though. The old Sammy's was hidden away on Sunset Rd, very hard to find. This new spot on Green Valley Pkwy is much more convenient and visible!   Opening the menu, it looked familiar with the original items, plus a few new additions (or have I just overlooked them?)   Vietnamese Crab Stack was refreshing, light, and very tasty. Presented so elegantly, my whole table enjoyed it.   Off the happy hour menu, the Kobe Sliders had rave reviews from my boyfriend & his parents.  I've also enjoyed: Mediterranean Dip Sampler Hummus Oak Roasted Asparagus Lobster Mac & Cheese Wok'd Sesame Shishito Peppers Grilled Shrimp Salad Salted Caramel Pudding  The food overall is pretty darn good. From their huge salad portions, unique tapas, Brie/truffle oil pizza w/ mushrooms (my favorite Sammy's pizza), or the ginormous Messy Sundae's overflowing goblet, there's many great dishes for every palate and appetite. Plus I ALWAYS appreciate any establishment that offers and labels vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options!  For me the best thing about this Sammy's is the interior set-up. I LOVE their patio area, where you can sit in plushy comfortable couches(with pillows!) which are part of their booths and look out the surrounding windows. It makes it airy, spacious, and welcoming. I can see me eating lunch there frequently if I worked nearby.  The prices are still pretty high, I always thought that. If ordering tapas, it's a shame if you don't go during happy hour, when selected items are half off.   Service has been a hit or miss here. It seems the first visits, the staff were still getting used to their new operation, so their timeliness was off. It's gotten better though, our last dinner with our parents was awesome! We'll be come back to try their brunch...",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and have tried a few items on the menu and it's always just okay. I've tried their pizzas, salads, desserts, variety of appetizers, and I've never had anything that really impressed me. The kobe beef sliders is usually what I go for when I come here because they are probably the best thing on the menu. The last time I went here they had a lot of new items and I was pretty excited about them. I tried the empanadas from the appetizers. Being Argentinian, I was interested in seeing what their interpretation of an empanada would be. Sadly, they were not very good. They were definitely not your traditional empanada. It seemed like they were frozen and heated up in a microwave. Needless to say, I won't be ordering them again. The service here is fantastic though, so I kind of wish their food matched the service.   A few tips:  If you want bread, you will have to ask for it. They don't provide it to you otherwise.  The salads here are huge, even for sharing. I would recommend getting the individual sized salad, even if you are sharing it. If you have the option, ask the hostess to seat you on the right side of the restaurant. This is where they have huge windows that brings in a lot of natural lighting.",

When she brought the dish to me, it was a lousy tomato and cucumber sandwich. No burger, no cheese. Just really sad. The fries were good however. The grey goose martini that I ordered was $16. Whaaaaaaaaaat? Omg it wasn't even that good. Too much vermouth. I don't think I will go there again. And to top it off our food server looked stressed out and I felt like not complaining cuz she already looked upset upon the onset of service. Again sad state of affairs.",

First off Matty and crew did a fantastic job with their service. They were quick and attentive and Johnny on the spot with my questions. The drinks had a nice punch and mixed correctly so I could enjoy my meal and not be overly buzzed. The food well the Kobe sliders were nice, the pizza under whelming with first try cold. That was not my gripe, for the True downer to the attentive patron was the manger chewing out in slient fashion the bartenders for a issue with the togo's and taking out $10 from their tip jar. My business opinion, since I own three, is to have dedicated personal for Togo orders. The bar was super slammed with just restaurant business. The star of the show was the service at the bar and the sweet hostess whom picked up my fallen coat from my stool on more then one occasion. The empathy is there with the staff, and so I will be back tomorrow to try something new on the menu, for I recommend this place.",

Tonight - and as I can see from reviews on Yelp for the past five months that validates tonight's experience - service was an absolute disaster.  Appetizers took way too long to come out. When one if the managers came by to see how we were doing, I made a comment about the kitchen being backed up. He said she would find out what the delay was. Literally sixty seconds later, they came out... along with one entree. Sent that back and were told they would remake it and serve with the other entrees. Entrees came out - 4 of the 6 ordered. Ten minutes later the missing two finally came out after my husband complained to the manager.  Had to send one of the entrees back. These mishaps continued throughout the evening. Though the manager 'adjusted' our bill to compensate for all the mishaps, our semi-absentee waiter and all the other mistakes ruined the evening. And from recent reviews, these types of issues have been ongoing for months. No wonder, on a Saturday night, the place was half empty.  Please Sammy's - FIX THE PROBLEMS. We'll not be back until we see better reviews.",

    "text": "What a disappointing departure from all the other Sammy's restaurants in town.  The food was the same as the other restaurants, but the service was atrocious.  I arrived at the restaurant an hour and a half before closing, but the employees were already working on cleaning and closing up the place instead of paying attention to the customers.  There were ~ 8-10 tables of customers, but only 2 servers that I saw working.  I saw 5 servers sitting at tables busy folding dozens of napkins.  Others were refilling the condiments on the tables. Meanwhile, our server took 15 minutes to initially approach us.  Water took another 10 minutes and tasted like it came straight from the faucet, although our server assured us that it was triple filtered.  One bottle of beer came to our table almost 20 after we ordered it!  Out server brought our food out without any serving utensils (we had to ask for it) and one glass of wine didn't arrive until our meal was almost finished.  Instead of checking us, he was busy chatting with his coworkers. The most insulting part of our meal was the 2 employees who were furiously sweeping the floor around us as we ate.  I wondered how they would like it if I swept dirt up in the air around their food while they ate.  If I ever return to this location, it will be for take out.  It's a shame because the restaurant is very nice, much nicer than the other locations.",

Definitely try the Mini Kobe Beef Burger with both cheeses and ask for extra Chipotle Aioli sauce on the side for the fries. Tasted so delicious.",

They also sucked at clearing tables. The menu was hot mess!!! Asian, Mediterranean, Italian,  Mexican,  tapas, pastas, pizzas. Uhh... yeah. I couldn't figure out what to order! It took me forever. Normally I'd start ordering everything that looks appetizing, but nothing caught my eye. Maybe because I didnt know where to look.  Also im baffled at how huge the salads were, but then the entrees are so so, and you only get a soup cup of 8oz. It makes no sense!!! Like is the salad an entree? I'm so confused as to what is going on. The only reason I gave it a two was because it looks really nice inside.",

John greeted me on the phone and took my order. He and I spoke about different selections on the menu. I was surprised at not only how well he knew the menu, but how he was able to suggest items based on the menu items I was ordering. It was nice to talk to someone about the many different dishes. It would take forever to try them all! He was friendly, hospitable and very willing to take care his customers. So Thanks for your help today John! Keep up the great work, we will be back.

    "text": "My family of four went last Friday night around 7 pm. We worried because this is  usually a very busy time, and they were very busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes outside, which was not bad at all. However, there is no place to wait inside, especially on a busy night and they need to hand out buzzers so the hostess doesn't have to come out and yell names aloud. Luckily it wasn't cold outside, so waiting was not bad at all. I'm sure they will eventually get the buzzers.   Our server was very personable and gave good service. Our tapas appetizer of three different hummus dips with some sort of warm yummy pita bread was so good. It was perfect if you're just ordering a salad as your entree, because that's what I did and I was totally stuffed.   My daughters loved their dinners too: BBQ chicken with potatoes and cheeseburgers sliders with fries. I did wish they had something green on the side with the kids meals like broccoli or spinach, but the quality of the food was very good.  I would say the quality of these kids meals compared to other restaurants is better for sure.   I had my favorite balsamic salad with chicken. I've always loved this salad, but Sammy's needs to not drench it so much in the balsamic dressing. It was very good, but overly coated in dressing.    Husband had fish tacos which he said were very good.   For desert, we had the most delicious mini donuts with raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. They were so good, they reminded me of churros. It was just perfect amount of sweet for four people. We loved it!  The ambiance was nice because it's fancy, but not so fancy that we didn't feel weird bringing our kids on a Friday night. We saw several other families with kids in our section, so that was good. You can tell they try to sit families near each other and the on a date and just adults in a separate section. Which is good for everyone because then the people with kids don't feel bad if they get too noisy with the people that are there without kids.   Of course, bringing kids we had to make 3 trips to the restrooms, which were small, but also very nice. Clean and pretty stone all the way up to the ceiling.   We will definitely be going back!",

The ambience is very unique and the atmosphere is one that none can compare to. There are two sides of the restaurant. One side being the traditional restaurant scenery with booths and tables and the other sides have just the opposite. There are giant windows surrounding the outside of the restaurant giving it an open feeling. The booths and tables have different chairs and set ups than the usual setting. There are plants all around that give this place a one of a kind decor. The food is also nothing short of fantastic. I've been here several times. To my surprise, I find that I enjoy this place more and more every time I stop by. If you're ever looking for something new and different, I would most definitely recommend Sammy's.",

Manager Paras and Assistant manager Tia responded to my email questions promptly and helped my daughters set up centerpieces, providing them with a small table for a powerpoint presentation and a cupcake stand.  The food  arrived for all 16 of us at the same time and was still hot.  Everyone said his/her selection was excellent, from the grilled asparagus omelet to the eggs benedict to the lemon and fresh blueberry pancakes.  Our server Jess checked in on us frequently and refilled coffees and mimosas several times.  I was worried because the restaurant does not have a separate banquet room, but for most of the 3 hours we were there, only a few other tables were occupied.  They did not rush us at all.

He cleared plates from tables, stopped to check to soccer stats on the tv, stopped to talk to another employee before going to drop off the dirty dishes.  He finally came back and took our orders.  I told him I wanted to start with the chili and either the kitchen was really slow or our server took forever to pick it up and bring it to us.    Throughout the meal he would disappear for a really long time.  Another table of two came in and were so annoyed they let him know how unhappy they were.  Needless to say their food came very quickly, but then he would disappear.  He brought us our bill when we were finally done, he dropped it off and disappeared for a good 8 to 10 minutes, really???  When we left, he was standing at the bar watching the soccer game even though he still had more tables to serve and did not even notice us walking past him, another employee also watching the tv noticed us and said goodbye as we reached the door.  Overall it was an interesting night, normally the manager comes around to see how things are going, not tonight....the only person I saw who looked like a manager hung out at the bar while the music was playing and when Ryan was done as he was cleaning up she hung out by him chatting with him.  I guess customers were not the priority on this night....",

My husband and I shared the shrimp salad, hummus and Brie pizza and they were all delicious. Our kids loved the wood fired pizza. The server was attentive and very helpful. Also, they give a great military discount, which we really appreciate. Great little neighborhood restaurant and we look forward to returning.",

It's very clean here and the environment is lively, full of light (there are beautiful windows) and class. If you are looking for somewhere to take a date, or take your family for a birthday (including kids) this is a classy yet down-to-earth diner. You need to check them out and oh yeah - the waitress Taylor is GREAT! :) She was attentive yet did not interrupt our conversation she made her presence known but let our conversation continue with out the usual server interruption \"how is everything\" .....I hate that..... I really appreciated Taylor and her professionalism. She was the cherry on top of a great meal and great conversation between me and my friend. Thanks Sammy's! We will be back :) esp for those tiny burgers OMG they are so good!! This is from their website and I could not agree more: \"A stylish setting and innovative menu come together at our newest Sammy's restaurant at the corner of Green Valley Pkwy & Pebble Rd. Also featuring 24-hour gaming and events all month long!\" -- ps go during happy hour 4-6 PM everyday and appetizers are a full serving and 1/2 price :) what a deal ..",

What's not to love?  I also ordered the Oak Roasted Chicken dinner.  Had to take most of it to go (it comes with 2 chicken breasts), but the pesto and pine nut concoction was great.",

The dining ambiance here is always great.  It's clean and has a welcoming feeling.  Service here can be hit and miss. For the most part they have been pretty friendly and attentive.    I finally ordered one of their huge salads.  It was an absolute delight! The Balsamic Grilled Chicken is one that I'd order again. It's filled with mixed greens, Gorgonzola, walnuts, basil and tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.  Definitely filling!  The appetizers have been a let down. Im probably going to start skipping those to go right into the main meal.  Burgers, wraps and salmon have all been good.    I'm happy that for the most part things have stayed on par since opening.",

    "text": "Nice people, good food, convenient to work and home. I dine here frequently, and have had no complaints so far. I almost had a complaint earlier because of some child screaming. I understand it's hard to raise infants/toddlers, but it's also common decency to try to comfort the kid without being a nuance to other patrons. Not this parent. This mom decided to ignore the screaming and totally disregard the other people trying to dine at the establishment. I was about to make a complaint, but apparently somebody beat me to it. The parent was asked to take the screaming kid outside, and the parent threw a fit. Immediately I saw where the child gets their mannerisms from, as the mom proceeded to cuss out and berate the employee that kindly asked them to step out. Mind you, the employee didn't tell her to leave and never come back, she kindly asked her to take her son outside momentarily to calm him down. Nothing rude about the employee, extremely rude of the mom. I'll continue to come here, as they genuinely care for the convenience of all patrons.  Update: So, I gotta say, what is going on with the music on Sundays? It's like elevator music for hipsters. I just got done listening to an electronica version of Bob Marley's \"Is This Love,\" and I'm pretty sure Bob is rolling in his grave due to that rendition (and listening to it, made me want to join him).   Now the song that's playing: it's like a song that makes me want to play in traffic or dance the salsa. Either scenario is probable at this point, but I'm leaning towards the first option.  Here's a recommendation, since it's a pandora station from what I believe: Put it on Gary Clark Jr.'s station, and call it good. Some awesome blues would be fitting for the atmosphere.   You're welcome. Keeping the rating at a 5, even though the music on Sundays is upsetting.",

Paras the regional manager and the GM have since made contact and we have resolved what had happen.

My spaghetti and meatballs were okay, but there wasn't very much.. The bread they sent was so little, it was for two people not 4. I didn't get to eat dinner because I gave my spaghetti and meatballs to my kids. You could tell the person who put it together doesn't care at all. Oh and the chicken for the salads was over cooked so bad it was blackened to much to eat. Just crazy and I like Sammy's. I've been to green valley location many times and always enjoyed it. Take out from green valley was such that I'll never order take out again.",

The service isn't usually that great but no big deal, the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread (my favorite) out-weighs the not so attentive service.  Last night will be the last time I eat from this place.  I ordered the lobster bisque and garlic cheese bread to go and brought it right home and ate it.  About 2 hours later I began throwing up violently on and off for a couple hours.  Waking up this morning on Thanksgiving of all days still with a very upset and sensitive stomach.  I have no other \"illness type\" symptoms.  I think the need to have someone from the health department come out and check the dates and temps because I definitely got sick from eating from here last night.  Not good at all.",

However, they need a better way or space for people waiting for a table.   The ambience was very nice (Californian). Cozy.  The menu was very diverse with still the staple of Sammy's (pizzas). Boys got pizza and burger, thumbs up. Asian salad was okay. Shrimp and grits good, but have to grab some chorizo and grits for flavor. Salmon with edamame was horrible. Their idea of flavor is to layer soy sauce on the bottom of the plate. No! Deducted Star.  Service was okay. Waitress didn't seem to have a good day maybe?   Overall, service just seemed off from the time you come in the restaurant to the end of service. Deducted star.  I would go back to give it another try.",

We've now been there twice, and both times it was very good.  The first time we had the satay and calamari appetizers.  The chicken satay was cooked beautifully and was tender, but the best part of it was the peanut sauce.  We liked it so much we ordered a container of it to bring home.  The calamari was different than we've ever had.  It was more of a calamari meatball than regular fried calamari.  It was seasoned well and cooked well.  I really liked it, but my wife did not like the texture.  The second time we had the Asian appetizer which included potstickers, satay, and grilled shrimp, and they were all superb.  We also had the Thai salad and the NY pizza.  The chicken on the salad was tender and very good.  The pizza had great taste and was cooked evenly on the bottom, which is better than 99% of the other wood fired pizza places.  We also had one of the best servers we ever had.  Her name was Jess.  She was cheerful, prompt, and had great follow-up even though the restaurant was full and she was very busy.  She saw we hadn't received our food yet and checked on it without our asking.  We appreciated that she didn't give us a personal sob story to increase our tip.  We will certainly go back to Sammy's again.",

We ordered a 5 cheese pizza and were completely disappointed.  I should have known that it wasn't going to be good as when I picked up the box, I had to check to see that there was a pizza in there as it was so light.  The pizza tasted like something you'd get at Cici's or a low chain buffet.  Completely disappointed.  We also ordered the Balsamic Grilled Chicken Salad and this was ok.  The chicken was a bit burnt and dry.  We also ordered some Pork Dumplings and they were probably the best thing we ordered.  As for the service, there was some confusion on how to pay for a to-go order when I went to pick it up . . . they were nice enough about it, but just seemed like they still haven't gotten the flow of a new restaurant yet.  I looked at the other reviews and just didn't have the same experience as others had.  Maybe it was an off night . . . maybe the food doesn't hold up when you take it to go.  Maybe we need to dine in and see what we think before completely writing off this restaurant.   I do know this . . . . If I want to order Pizza to go, I would much rather get it from Metro Pizza.  Hands down!!!",

We called ahead and requested a reservation for 6 at 6pm. Table was ready as promised. Seating was not good. They had us in a large round table half sofa seating. My guests had to use pillows to try and elevate them to the table. Very uncomfortable.  My son ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It came out in a small bowl, nothing at all special. He swore up and down that it was either artificial lobster or maybe even imitation crab  meat. Very small portion, meat was not very good. Mom ordered duck tacos. Has had them many times before. Evidently the chefs are being pressured to watch food costs. There was nothing more than a tiny sliver of duck meat on each tack. Very chincey. The service was lousy. We had to ask multiple times for dishes to be removed from the table, drinks to be refilled.  We are not alcohol drinkers. OUr total bill with tip was $170 for 6 of us. Not one person was blown away by their meal. All of us were disappointed in the quality of food. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Arrived at 8:50 pm, we were promptly greeted at and sat by a young man wearing glasses. There were about 8 people at the bar, the bartender said hello as we walked to our table. There were 4 tables dining.  We were told Heather would be right with us. After perusing the dinner choices on the menu Heather arrived. She asked if we would like anything to drink. I had flipped my menu over and as I was deciding between the house chardonnay and the Clos du bois Heather apparently grew impatient. She said I'll get you some waters in a clipped tone. Not more than 45 seconds had transpired since she had arrived at the table. We said water would be great thank you. She arrived back with the waters and said she would come back if we hadn't decided on entrees. We then ordered the crab and artichoke dip. She did not ask if we wanted anything other than water. I felt as though she was judging us, our appearances, and our financial status.  When she came back from placing the appetizer order I ordered a wine and we placed our dinner order. The appetizer was tasty and we enjoyed it while mulling over what Heather's issue might be. While waiting for our entrees we heard a plate clatter to the floor in the direction of the kitchen. We joked that it was one of our dinners considering the amount of time that had passed. 5 or more minutes later Heather comes to tell us it would just be a few more minutes. Ten minutes later she tells us my sliders were burnt on the outside so the kitchen was remaking them.  I work in Hospitality as a Supervisor for a large corporation and have heard every excuse for a long ticket time there is. Blaming the kitchen is a servers go-to excuse. Once the food arrived we were for the most part satisfied with it, but still slightly put off by Heather's demeanor. She was not friendly, nor did she attempt to engage in any manner. We were one of her two tables she was serving at the time. We ate quickly and when she came to clear the plates she asked if we wanted dessert. At this point I had decided against dessert not because I didn't want have dessert but because I didn't wish to be Heather's guest any longer. She brought the check, I placed my card in the book and she offered mini doughnuts to go on the house. Too little too late. I'm not saying we will not dine again because the food was enjoyable once it arrived, I am simply hopeful that should we dine again we get a server that enjoys their job and puts customer service first. We left Heather a 16% tip which was generous considering her service.",

I ordered a glass of reisling and the server asked if it was red or white! I asked about the Greek yogurt on the menu she didn't know it was there. Upon leaving I asked the manager about it and he didn't know about it either. It still says 24 hours on website and menu but it's not! I will be back for the food. I just won't ask any questions.

    "text": "I'm hooked.  Occasionally the service is less than stellar, and people tend to bring young, loud kids here later than the usual \"young, loud kids\" hours for family restaurants.  But the food is both sensational and out-of-the-ordinary.  I've been four times, and each time I order two items off the appetizer menu, which is both extensive and diverse.  \"The Hot Rock\" (spoiler alert!) was a huge surprise, as it's actually a stone heated to an extreme temp and served with raw beef strips that you cut up and heat on the rock itself.  It was an amusing novelty, and it turned out to be really enjoyable, too!  Also enjoyed the crab-and-artichoke dip (even the pita bread is fantastic) and an amazing hot fudge and caramel sundae we got for free because we celebrating a birthday.  Can't rave about the Kobe chili or the chinese chicken salad, but I think it was just a matter of personal taste.  I'd certainly recommend going after 8 on a weeknight or even later on the weekend, but overall Sammy's serves some wonderful dishes and definitely offers something DIFFERENT from the usual fare.",

    "text": "We had heard great things about Sammy's so we thought we would give it a go. We were greeted and sat promptly. Very crowded and had families around which made it a little loud for intimate conversation. I ordered a Lobster mac and cheese for a tapas appetizer, was not as impressed as the reviews posted said I would be. I did see a lot of them ordered. If it was half of the price it was offered at I would have been okay with it. taste wise it was good, had lumps of crab meet and a good amount of cheese. I ordered a pizza The New York Style. I thought New York style would at least be cooked through. The crust was crunchy but the middle was under cooked and doughy. not impressed. Not sure what specialty is here since their menu is all over the place. Josie had the Grilled Hawaiian Mahi Tacos. These were fresh and spicy, maybe too spicy for the spouse. I had some and I thought her choice for dinner out did mine. Overall it was nice, they were attentive which is a must. May or may not go here again. Can say to try it your experience may out way mine.",

    "text": "Just had a long lunch at Sammy's with friends for a total of seven people.  The waitress was very attentive and was very thoughtful to suggest running separate checks to make it easier on the diners.  She was around frequently to refill drinks without ever having to be asked.  We ordered different wood fire pizza's and various salads.  I shared a thin pizza with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts and goat cheese and it was so flavorful, fresh and light , I then shared a chopped salad with chicken with a very light red wine vinaigrette.  It was so fresh and delicious.  The serving sizes are very generous and the prices extremely reasonable.  New to the Henderson area,  this was the best restaurant I've been to.  I'm sorry I didn't remember the server's name but we were the only large table at 1 PM so many thanks for a great lunch.  For many of us at the table, this was our first time and we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "So we decided to give Sammy's another shot after being invited back by the GM. SO glad we did!! The service was much improved this time around, we saw much more of our server, Alex, than we did of our server during our last visit. We had the dumplings (finally!) as well as their calamari, both of which were awesome. We also enjoyed their flourless chocolate cake. Some of the menu descriptions don't do this delicious food justice. We were thoroughly impressed not only by the display of exceptional management but also the fantastic server we had who not only made suggestions but also ensured our glasses were never empty and our plates didn't sit for too long. I hope this was not a fluke and I truly hope that Sammy's is striving to improve their customer service. As for us, we will certainly be back and recommend to friends in the GV area. I hope next time around the service and food are just as consistent. Thank you Sammy's staff for restoring my faith in the customer service industry!!",

The food was terrific and I would not hesitate to go there again for that reason.  The reason for the low star is our waitress. She was curt to the point of being rude.  My gal asked for the Orange-Horseradish sauce as an addition to her salmon, and the waitress say it's not horseradish sauce, it's Orange Marmalade. My gal asked her (very sweetly I might add) to check for her as it's delicious and she's had it before with the coconut shrimp.  The waitress brought her Orange Marmalade with no horseradish mixed in.  We went ahead and ate, then my gal asked for the menu and she, sweetly again, showed the waitress what she was talking about and the waitress said \"Well, we call it Orange Marmalade\" and walked off.  I wish I had my receipt for the gals name, but alas I don't.  When I come back we'll go there again, but I will refuse service from this rude brunette.",

It took 20 minutes for someone to take our order, I never knew my servers name, when the order was taken 2 entrees were not entered into the system.  Dressing was not brought and forgotten about. The chopped salad was the worst salad ever. No server came and asked if everything is ok. So here's my advice.... Do not give a server a busy station, servers need to communicate with customers as people because last time I check I was a person and I can be talked to about anything. The manager was absolutely amazing and I thank him for that but no service recovery helped us. Please retrain your servers. The customers deserve that for giving you their money and are there for a positive experience so they will be repeat customers. I hope this changes because it's just another checked off place that I will never go to.",

The service has really gotten bad and the food is not as good as it used to be. It took over 15 minutes before a waiter came to my table. He was swamped and was trying to wait on too many tables. I noticed they didn't have any busboys or extra staff to clean the tables. The tables around me still had dirty plates and glasses from previous diners who had left. I understand the waiters were to take orders, run the food and clean up. It's never a good idea to cut back on staff when the patrons are the ones who suffer. It's not a great way to promote your restaurant. My family of 4 had wanted a quick lunch which turned into very long experience. After waiting 15 minutes to be spoken to add another 15 till we got our drinks and then 30 minutes till we got our food, which by the way was not what we ordered. My husband's order was not correct and it took another 15 minutes till they brought out his correct order. The prices have increased every time I have returned and I'm not sure its worth the price anymore.",
